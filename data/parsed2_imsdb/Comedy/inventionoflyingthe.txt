written by ricky gervais matthew robinson june a small caveman community made up of five large caves all facing out towards a crackling fire
slack jawed yet strong and confident cavemen stumble about dragging haunches of meat pounding the dirt with sticks dragging the women
we pan over to a small cave
not even really a cave at all but a crack in the rocks barely large enough to sleep in
stepping out of this cave is a small weak nerdy looking caveman
the chief caveman set apart by the large mallet he wields steps towards the fire and grunts loudly to mark the beginning of a caveman meeting
loser caveman steps forward apprehensively only to be met with laughter from the other cavemen
loser caveman sighs and shrinks back into his sad little cave watching them from the shadows
grunting subtitled me see beast today
beast danger for caveman
the rest of the cavemen look nervous
if caveman kill beast
caveman have food
the cavemen grunt in understanding
who kill beast
the cavemen grunt amongst themselves
the toughest of the bunch steps forward pounds his chest and grunts
grob kill beast
the chief notices loser caveman watching from a distance
loser want kill beast
all the cavemen turn and laugh at the loser caveman
loser kill nothing
all the cavemen laugh hysterically
look at loser cave
fuck that guy
all the cavemen pick up rocks and begin throwing them at the loser caveman who dives out of his cave and runs around the camp dodging their blows
everyone in the village is asleep
everyone that is but loser caveman who sleeps uncomfortably in his tiny little cave tossing and turning unable to get comfortable
a stirring in the trees causes loser caveman to sit upright
theres something outside of the village
suddenly a giant tusked boar pushes through the trees and stands looking quite menacing not ten yards from the village fire
loser caveman is practically shaking with fear
the boar makes eye contact with loser caveman and charges directly towards his tiny little cave
the giant boar runs head first into the cave opening but the opening is too small for the beast to fit its head inside
loser caveman screams like a girl
the boar backs up to strike again this one sure to be the end of loser caveman when a large boulder knocked loose by the boars first hit tumbles down
and lands smack on the boars head killing it instantly
the entire village runs out to see what has happened
the loser caveman stumbles out of the cave and dusts himself off
the chief steps forward
hey look at loser
he almost die
look he scared
the chief looks towards loser standing nervously near the corpse of the giant tusked boar
loser what happen
the beast it came at me
it smash my cave
everyone laughs hysterically
we pan over the many laughing faces pointing and hooting at loser cavemans cowardice
we watch as the loser cavemans face turns bright red the veins in his neck pop out and his fists clench up tightly
suddenly we fly into the cavemans skull traveling through his cerebral cortex and towards the frontal lobe of his small homo erectus brain
sparks are flying back and forth across his brain as his synapses fire in rapid succession
there is a small explosion
we fly back out of loser cavemans skull his face contorted in rage
he interrupts everyones laughter
hold on one minute
everyone stops laughing
loser wasnt finished
loser caveman stands up straight and tall all of a sudden the bruce willis of cavemen
after beast smash cave loser look at beast and say not on losers watch
loser grab rock on ground lift above head and smash it down
right onto motherfuckers head
the entire village gasps
loser kill beast
now fuck off loser going back to sleep
the chief steps forward ominously then proclaims loser kill beast
loser caveman hero
loser steps forward grabs the prettiest of all cavewomen and drags her towards his cave as the entire village erupts in cheer
the worlds first lie
a monumental occasion in the history of mankind
that lowly caveman who stumbled upon the ability to lie went on to become chief of his village married dozens of cavewomen and passed on the lying gene to hundreds
of newborn cave children
over time lying spread throughout the world sparking the eventual birth of imagination itself story telling religion and the oh so important polite lie as in oh patty have you
you look fantastic
the world would be a very different place if events had gone otherwise on that prolific paleolithic eve
if not for that night man would have never acquired the ability to lie to himself and to others
a world without lying would be a world without dreams
a world without pretense
a world without fiction
a world without flattery
a world very unlike our own
the film rewinds about thirty seconds to the point where the chief asked what happened with loser caveman and the boar
loser what happen
the beast it came at me
it smash my cave
again we fly into the cavemans skull traveling through his homo erectus brain
sparks are flying back and forth across his brain as his synapses fire in rapid succession
but this time theres no explosion
we fly back out of loser cavemans skull his face contorted in rage
the rage slowly fades and loser just stands there everyone in the camp waiting for him to say something
rock fall on beast
loser do nothing
i think loser even soil bear pants
pause sniffing loser smell bad
everyone falls onto the ground laughing hysterically
loser biggest loser ever
caveman throw rocks at loser
everyone in the camp joins in on another round of throwing rocks at loser caveman as he runs around the camp terrified and miserable
a completely indistinguishable los angeles mid rent apartment complex
mark bellison pulls up in his early nineties volvo parks and enters
mark s average to semi handsome twists and turns through stucco hallways
he knocks on apartment c
jennifer mcdoogles opens her face flushed
i was just masturbating
that makes me think of your vagina
im mark how are you
a little frustrated at the moment
also equally depressed and pessimistic about our date tonight
i hope this date ends in sex
i dont find you attractive
come on in
jennifers apartment is new adult as if she just found out she was an adult yet hasnt had the time or the money to complete the transition
i need to finish getting ready
while doing that i might realize im still horny and try to finish masturbating without you hearing
jennifer heads towards the bathroom
mark stands alone in her living room looking around
shouting to her i feel awkward and i regret being early
shouting back yeah im disappointed youre early and not really looking forward to tonight in general but the thought of being alone the rest of my life scares both my
mother and i equally
its completely silent for a long beat
mark looks around then sits on her couch
shouting to her i have an erection now because i assume you began masturbating once we stopped talking
shouting to her im embarrassed because i think the restaurant ive made reservations at might not be expensive enough or hip enough to impress you but it was the best
i could do because i dont make very much money
you see im forty years old and have no real financial assets to speak of ive never owned a home and never had a significant relationship
my boss even told me today that im most likely going to get fired tomorrow and
jennifer enters the room and mark stops talking
i just masturbated
that makes me very horny
shall we go
mark stands up
jennifer picks up her purse and opens the door
mark and jennifer drive in silence for a beat
im only doing this as a favor for my cousin greg
he keeps begging me to go out on a date with you
he says youre funny
gregs a good friend
where are we eating tonight
a cute little place called la bonisera in west hollywood
you obviously dont have very much money but thats not necessarily a deal breaker
i have very little money
i also dont really care about a guy who knows all the latest hippest restaurants
i dont know any of them
in fact there are very few things in life that i care about all that much
the only things i have to offer myself or anyone else are my good looks and my affected sense of quirkiness which artistically inclined men interpret as intellect
jennifer contd in fact i think my best trait is the fact that ive made very few mistakes socially academically financially or romantically
i take very few risks and therefore lead a relatively happy and light hearted existence
mostly though im a kind sweet person with the potential of genuinely becoming a vital and interesting human being the day i take the energy i expend on hyper self
reflexivity and apply it to actual action in the reality of my life
i found that boring and started thinking about this places fish tacos
the volvo pulls up in front of the restaurant and the valet parking guy opens jennifers door
im extremely bored
the valet parking guy hands mark a ticket
they enter the quaint mexican restaurant
this isnt as nice as i remember it
what are we going to talk about
they approach the hostess
to jennifer im threatened by you
of course come with me
the hostess seats them in the midst of the semi crowded restaurant
a young awkward waiter approaches
im very embarrassed that i work here
to jennifer and youre pretty and that only makes me feel worse
can i get you two started on some drinks
ill have a budweiser
ill start with your mango margarita and probably have three more drinks by the end of the night
to mark shes out of your league
the waiter leaves
jennifer and mark peruse their menus
a woman screams out from a table on the other side of the room all of a sudden i got extremely angry
no one in the restaurant reacts
im going to ask you some questions about your life because thats what you do but ill only really listen to about half of what youre saying
how do you spend your days
i get up at eight in the morning because the noise from my alarm clock interrupts my sleep so i lean over and
thats a little more specific than i expected
well what did you want to know
do you have a job
what job do you have
i have a job at an office
what do you do
just typing and filing and stuff
do you enjoy it
but i enjoy the end result of the job which is money
and the hours are pretty good for the amount of money i make which i spend on things i like such as clothes hiking drinking even though i know its
bad for me
jennifer contd but id rather just get all the money and not work for the results
tell me more
im trying to get a little insight into you
well you already know a lot about me
you know im good looking because
here i am
you know im successful because youve seen my apartment and the clothes im wearing
and you know im happy because im smiling
jennifer smiles brightly
are you always happy
some days i stay in bed eating and crying
the waiter returns with their drinks
hands beer to mark here you go
hands drink to jennifer i had a sip of this
do you guys know what you want or do you need a moment
ill have a caesar salad with chicken because i think im fat but i also think i deserve something that tastes good
ill have the fish tacos because i had them once here and its all i know
excellent ill get those both started for you
the waiter leaves
jennifers cell phone rings from inside her purse
sorry one second
she pulls out her cell phone and checks it
its my mother this wont take long
probably checking in on our date
jennifer answers the phone
she talks openly and in plain view of mark
yes im with him right now
no not very attractive
no doesnt make much money
hes all right though
kind of funny
a bit fat
funny little snub nose
no i wont be sleeping with him tonight
nope probably not even a kiss
okay you too
jennifer hangs up
sorry about that
dont think twice
how is your mom
shes all right
both of their plates are now empty
three empty margarita glasses sit in front of jennifer
the waiter approaches with the bill and places it down in the middle of the table
to jennifer if i give you my number will you call me
mark walks jennifer to the front door of her apartment complex
thanks for going on this date with me
youre way way out of my league and i know you were just doing it as a favor to greg and that most likely ill never hear from you again
i actually had a better time than i thought id have but i wont know for sure how i feel about you until im less drunk
give me a call if you still like me once youre sober
mark leans in for a kiss
jennifer kisses him on the cheek and goes inside
thanks for kissing me on the cheek i know you didnt have to do that and
jennifer waves and heads inside
shouting after her youre very pretty
mark plops into bed in his boxers
his bedroom is bland uninspired and completely furnished by the cheapest stuff found in an ikea catalogue
mark flips on the tv and gets under the covers
a commercial comes on tv
a man in a suit stands next to a single can of coke resting on a small table
hi im jim and im the spokesperson for the coca cola company
im here today to ask you to continue buying coke
im sure its a drink youve been drinking for years and if you still enjoy it id like to remind you to buy it again sometime soon
its basically just brown sugar water we havent changed the ingredients much lately so theres nothing new about it i can say
we changed the can around a little bit
see the colors here are a little different and we even put a polar bear on it for the kids
also coke is very high in sugar can lead to obesity in children and adults who dont sustain a healthy diet and has a ph acidity level high enough to
dissolve teeth and bones over extended periods of time
coke also works great at removing corrosion from car batteries and loosening rusted bolts
so thats it its coke
everyone knows it
its very famous
im jim i work for coke and im asking you to not stop buying coke
insert coke logo with tagline its coke
its very famous
mark falls asleep with the tv on
marks alarm clock blares
groggily he rises and sighs deeply
he has nothing to look forward to today
or any day
mark stands in his buildings elevator
the doors open and frank mid forties and bald enters
hows it going
not so good
last night i went on a date with a girl ive had a crush on for years who will most likely never call me again and im pretty sure im
going to get fired today
i spent the whole night throwing up pain killers because im too afraid to take enough to kill myself
the elevator doors open on the lobby
mark nods at frank
see you tomorrow
as mark drives to work we take in a bit of his world
a homeless man stands on a street corner with a sign that reads i dont understand why im homeless and all of you are not
a business man talking loudly into his cell phone pulls up next to mark at a red light
im not talking to anyone on my cell phone
i only want people to assume im very busy
at another red light mark eavesdrops on a couple having a loud argument in front of a coffee shop
i woke up this morning and realized that not only do i not love you but that the thought of touching you sickens me
the more you hate me the more i fall in love with you
a bus passes in front of marks car
angle on the bus ad simply shows a can of pepsi and reads pepsi
when they dont have coke
a car honks behind mark
the man leans out of his car and yells at mark
move it fatty
mark drives forward waving to the man apologetically as the man zooms past him
mark parks his car and walks towards a large office building
the sign on the building reads lecture films motion picture studios we film someone telling you about things that happened
in front of the building is a man in a suit standing on his briefcase with his tie around his head screaming
this isnt natural
none of this is natural
were all animals
this doesnt feel right
why am i wearing clothes
how can you people live like this
where did all this concrete come from
mark walks right by him
a woman in a business suit stops him on his way through the front door
i dont want to go in there today
i just dont
mark nods understandingly and enters the building
as mark walks through the lobby we get a brief glimpse of some of the movie posters lining the wall the holocaust the death of the dinosaurs napoleon the civil
each poster shows a different austere man sitting in a chair holding a script in his lap with a title above his head
the posters are extremely boring
a tour guide leads a row of tourists through the lobby
as mark enters we overhear the tour guides speech
all of lecture films productions are written filmed and edited right here on this very lot
in fact this building is where lecture films talented writers scour through the worlds past events searching for the most entertaining dramatic and even hilarious moments of world history which
are then turned into scripts handed over to our world famous readers and filmed for your viewing pleasure
the whole tour oohs
the tour guide walks over towards a large flat screen television embedded into the wall
if youll just follow me over to this monitor youll get a sneak peak at lecture films upcoming summers blockbuster napoleon to
everyone oohs again
mark curious as well stops to watch the trailer with the tour
angle on tv screen
a black screen
coming this summer from lecture films motion picture studios
written by oscar winning screenwriter rob marlowe
intercut mark scowling at this name
and starring oscar winning reader nathan goldfrappe comes the epic sequel to last years most talked about film napoleon to
prepare for the adventure
the black fades to nathan goldfrappe a middle aged austere man sitting before a fire in a velvet smoking jacket holding a script
and so napoleon invaded russia with a brute force of nearly seven hundred thousand men behind him armed with muskets and supported by canon brigades
learn of his defeat
through the devastating snow they marched crippled by disease and hunger napoleons men marched on
listen to his redemption
intercut the tour enraptured by this trailer
a few of the tourists whisper to each other
i love these films
saves me reading the book
intercut the trailer title slamming onto the screen napoleon to
coming this summer from lecture films
the trailer ends and the tour applauds
the tour guide turns to find mark walking away
look everyone there goes mark bellison one of lecture films very own screenwriters
the whole tour turns towards mark
mark turns around and dejectedly waves
hes one of our least successful writers here at lecture films
i also hear hes most likely getting fired today
the tour nods at mark
mark nods back
now lets head to editing bay where we can watch
mark walks past cubicle after cubicle until he comes to his office and shelley his attractive late s receptionist
im still attracted to you today
everyday i realize more and more how over qualified i am for this position and how incompetent you are at yours
anthonys coming by within the hour to see if he can work up the courage to fire you
if he cant he said hell definitely do it tomorrow
nobody else called
no calls to do with actual work
well i told everybody you were getting fired this week and not to expect their calls returned so no one left any messages
next time id rather you took down the messages just in case i dont get fired
youre almost definitely getting fired
well it hasnt happened yet
okay but everybody knows you are
okay ill be in my office
okay ill be searching for new jobs on craigslist
marks office is completely boring and unremarkable much like his apartment
theres a knock on his door
anthony enters looking very much the boss in his expensive suit yet nervous and fearful as well
wow you look really depressed today
thats going to make this so much harder
anthony dont fire me
anthony sits down on the other side of marks desk and leans forward
mark the s are boring
nothing interesting happened in that century
nobody cares about the post roman pre enlightenment era
the last few scripts you turned in were depressing
they were about the black plague
its the s anthony what else am i going to write about
its not totally your fault mark
you got stuck with a bad century
i can make it work
give it up mark its not like something new is going to have happened in the s
at lecture films were no longer interested in searching through the less well known historical periods for great events we just want to take the big name readers of the
day and have them read the historical events that people know and love the holocaust d day the birth of electricity
these are the stories people want to see because they know them
they find comfort in them
do you think i could come back and do this tomorrow
i just got very nervous about firing you
i dont do well with confrontation
is there anyway you could do it now
id rather not put it off
anthony thinks for a moment struggling to find the courage
anthony slinks out of the room
mark looks down at his computer to see he has an email in his inbox
angle on marks computer the email reads i woke up this morning sober and realized that while i did enjoy your company based on your looks your financial situation and
your position in life i have no interest in you romantically
im just too far out of your league
mark sits back in his chair and sighs deeply
shes a really good writer too
with all of his meager belongings stuffed into a box mark leaves his office stopping in front of shelleys desk
i loathed almost every minute i worked for you
i often fantasized about you naked
what are you going to do now
i have no idea
but i have very little hope for the future
i dont have much hope for you either but i wish you good luck
mark heads towards the elevator and is stopped by rob marlowe a little weasel man with a hip haircut and expensive clothes
so they fucking fired you huh dipshit
i always knew the black plague would never work as a movie
guess the s were as much of a loser as you are
please dont make me feel worse
or actually whatever go ahead i dont think i could possibly feel worse
i fucking always hated you
youre a shitty writer assigned to a shitty century and youre a little man bitch
but i was always threatened by you because i knew there was something different about you that i didnt understand and i fucking hate things i dont understand
but you will always be a loser and i will always be more successful than you in nearly every way
thats just the way it is
and shelley calls you an ass fag behind your back
well now i feel worse
rob storms off
mark slinks into the elevator and hangs his head in shame as the doors close
mark enters the building
mark walks up to the front desk to find a young receptionist
are you looking to abandon an elderly person
i already have
im her grandson
ooh its good youre here
shes not doing well
you should say your final goodbyes today
you say that every time im here
shes at the top of our death pool
mark walks down the hall passing different elderly people who reach out to him
you look like my dead son
life gets worse with each passing minute
im on pills that make everything orange
mark opens a door and enters
an elderly woman in a light blue robe sits on the side of her bed with her back to mark staring at the wall only inches from her face
oh grandma that is so depressing
come on at least stare at the ceiling or something
mark takes his grandmother by the hand and steers her to the other side of her bed
the television is broken
the television isnt broken
you probably sat on the remote and changed it to channel two again
mark flicks on the tv with the remote
static fills the screen
he changes the channel and a picture comes into view
see you had it on the wrong channel
it needs to be on channel three in order for the satellite to work
i dont understand anything you just said and that makes me scared and angry
i cant understand what it feels like to be you so it just irritates me and makes me think youre stupid
but i also love you and wish things were better for you
i do too
grandma i lost my job today
im forty years old
im completely alone and ive got absolutely no prospects for anything
im sorry mark
things arent any better for me here
i cant afford most of my medication im very alone and i forget more and more every day
im just so tired of life
why does life have to be so
whats the word
dont you sometimes wish you could change things
dont you sometimes wish you werent such a loser
i dont think im a loser
of course youre a loser grandma
our family is made up of losers
were all poor were all average looking were all only moderately intelligent were all lonely and unloved
well were poor because we werent born with money and its very hard to make enough money in a single lifetime to move from one social class to another
were only moderately intelligent because theres been a lot of inbreeding in our lineage
and were only lonely and unloved right now
remember ive had two husbands i loved very much in my lifetime
martha contd and maybe one day youll have a wife that you love very much too
yeah but im not talking about the past grandma
im talking about right now
and right now were both losers grandma
were both shitty shitty losers
dont you know that
i suppose we are
but things could be worse
we could be homeless
id rather be dead than be homeless
thats why i need to get out there and find a job
if i have to be homeless im going to kill myself
well thats sad
i love you mark
good luck finding a job
i love you too grandma
as he shuts the door from the hallway he hears the channel change and turn back to static
mark and his friend greg s an even less attractive less interesting and less intelligent version of mark are bellied up the bar with half empty beers in front of
ill start looking for a job tomorrow
lately i dont like indian people
i dont like white people even more though
i fucking hate white people
i fucking hate people
hey thanks for setting me up with your cousin by the way
shes hot right
way out of your league
dunno why you bothered
it felt nice to go out with someone that pretty
like for just one moment i experienced what it would be like to be the type of person someone like that would date
it felt good
doesnt matter anyway
i will always be just who i am right now average looking of average intelligence with an average personality
just a completely generic human being
your life is still better than mine
by a good margin
a sad beat
lately ive been crying in my sleep and waking up in a pool of urine
i really wish i had a better friend than you
so what are you going to do now
i dont know
guess ill start looking for another crappy job
doubt youll find one
not much need for an out of work writer specializing in the black plague
mark downs his last shot
im going to go now
youre seriously depressing me
i really wish i was cool enough to have a better friend than you
im the best youre gonna get man
call me later
mark gets up and drunkenly stumbles out of the bar
mark drunkenly lies in bed
he picks up the phone and dials
mark just breathes too scared to say anything
i can hear you breathing
is this a rapist
no its mark
mark hangs up quickly embarrassed and ashamed
he sighs and turns off the light
the alarm clock goes off
shut the fuck up i dont even have a job
mark tosses the alarm clock across the room and goes back to bed
a loud banging wakes mark who groggily stumbles out of bed
mark opens the door to find his landlord a middle aged well groomed man
im here for the rent
i was going to come talk to you about that
i got fired yesterday
thats why im here for the rent
well i havent got it
how much do you have
i think ive got about three hundred dollars in my bank account
the rent is eight hundred dollars
i havent got it
then youre evicted
ill help you with your things
a stunned mark stands helpless as the landlord pushes past him grabs a lamp from his living room and carries it out into the hallway
help me with the couch
it looks heavy
mark sighs and follows the landlord back into his apartment
with all of his belongings piled up in the hallway a tired and sweaty mark stares defeatedly at his landlord
you have one day to get your things out of this hallway
how am i supposed to do that
youve got three hundred dollars
rent a truck
oh fuck me
mark grits his teeth in rage
mark steps up to the female teller at the bank
mark is at the lowest point in his entire life
how can i help you today
id like to make a withdrawal
im confident i can help you with that
ive just been evicted from my apartment so i need to withdraw what i have left in my account so i can move my things out
i guess i need to close out my account to do that
i think im about to be homeless
close on mark this sinks in
unfortunately sir the system is down right now so im not going to be able to perform an account closure until the system is back up
but i can assist you in a withdrawal
how much would you like to withdraw
well id like to withdraw eight hundred dollars
the bank teller smiles at mark
how much are you going to withdraw today sir
all of it
just whatever is left
the system is down sir
please tell me how much you have in your account
at the peak of his despair something suddenly comes over mark
his face turns a light shade of red as the wheels begin to spin in his brain
he is fighting something within
we fly into marks skull traveling through his cerebral cortex and towards the frontal lobe of his brain
sparks are flying back and forth across his brain as his synapses fire in rapid succession
there is a small explosion
we fly back out of marks skull his eyes are locked on the bank tellers like a deer in the headlights
awkwardly fast eight hundred dollars
more confident i have eight hundred dollars in my bank account
the teller locks eyes with mark
then looks towards her computer
wait a second here
the system just came back up
to co worker system seems to be back up guys
to mark just one second while i access your account
you said youre withdrawing eight hundred correct
mark breaks out in a cold sweat
the bank teller types on her keyboard
well look at this
it says here youve only got three hundred dollars in your account
but you said you wanted to withdraw eight hundred
mark doesnt know what to say
he tries to speak but nothing comes out
i apologize for this sir but it seems our system has made a mistake
hold on one second while i go and get your eight hundred dollars
did you want that in large or small bills
the teller walks away
mark looks around nervously awkwardly smiling at the other tellers
to co worker guys the computers seem to be a bit buggy
will someone call james to come in and look into it please
moments later the bank teller returns and begins counting out eight hundred dollars for mark
mark stares at the money with wide eyes
there you are
eight hundred dollars
anything else i can do for you today
in shock mark shakes his head
the bank teller smiles big at him
sometimes our computers can get a bit buggy especially when the system goes down
sorry for any inconvenience
its no problem
mark takes his money and hurriedly walks away
bursting out of the bank mark is a caveman who just invented fire
mark knocks on his landlords door
a short stodgy old man opens the door
what are you doing here
mark holds out a wad of money
paying my rent
the landlord looks at the money and slowly reaches out to take it
where did you get this money
it was amazing
i went in to the bank and the system was down and i was going to take out three hundred dollars but she asked me how much id like to
take out and
mark stops himself
something else takes over within
i found it
lying on the street
the landlord and mark both lock eyes for a tense beat
give me my key back
mark jumps around his apartment dancing and screaming
mark is a caveman who just invented sex
today i stumbled upon something no man has ever stumbled upon before
what i have done today they will write about in history books for generations to come
and yet only moments ago
it was unfathomable not only to myself but to mankind as a whole
what i have found there is no word for
and it was as simple as
long pause how do i explain this
long pause mark and greg sit at the bar greg half listening as an inspired mark ends his monologue
i said something
greg perks up
i said something
whats the word im looking for
well there is no word
of course theres not i just invented it
mark is frustrated by his inability to explain
calling over bartender jim
jim mid s short and stout waddles over
mark stands up clears his throat and holds his hands out like gimme some room
theres a long pause as mark summons his newfound talent my name is doug
greg and jim look at mark confusedly
dead serious your name is doug
without hesitation hi doug
it amazes me that i never knew your real name
doug is good
it suits you
mark is flabbergasted
come on guys
are you serious
whats my name
my name is mark
still dead serious your name is mark
still without hesitation hi mark
mark suits you much better
you guys arent following me
i knew it
youre very light skinned but i can see it
ive always wanted a black friend
mark punches the bar in anger
fuck it im an eskimo
ive never seen a black eskimo
okay im a pirate
i didnt know they still had those
are you a dangerous pirate
okay then im a lion tamer
and i have purple hair
arent you scared youll get bitten one day
to greg i want to die my hair purple just like marks
mark sits at the bar looking completely bored
im a one armed jewish space explorer
whens your launch date
howd you lose your arm
i invented the bicycle
i love your work
can you get me a discount on a ten speed
mark sighs finishes his beer and gets up to leave
i give up
and im bored
mark heads towards the door dejected
he turns back
guys if you had the power to make things the way you wanted them what would you do first
if i could do anything in the world
anything at all
greg and jim think this over long and hard
id bone bitches asses
right in the ass
specifically the ass
if i could change things i would make all the hot chicks bone me
mark mulls this over
alright then lets try that
mark downs his beer and heads towards the exit
where are you going
mark walks the street a hunter looking for his prey
within seconds mark spots a gorgeous blonde walking right towards him
he stops in his track quickly trying to decide how best to proceed
but as the blonde passes him he just stares at her like a deer in the headlights
dont look at me im not attracted to you
the blonde walks away
mark stands on the sidewalk staring off into space the wheels in his mind working overtime
then it hits him
ive heard it all before
immediately the blondes eyes well up in tears
she is terrified
do we have time to get to a motel or do we have to do it right here
mark is a caveman who just invented his penis
the neon sign outside reads a cheap motel for intercourse with a near stranger
we slowly push in on the door of room
we hear noises inside that at first sound like moaning but as we get closer
they sound more like crying
bawling her eyes out and sitting on the bed doing her best to get her shoes off is the hot blonde
mark sits across from her a look of guilt and revulsion on his face
this is not what he expected
im sorry im just so scared
i dont want the world to end
blonde contd i dont want to die in this motel room
i think im going to throw up
help me get my pants off
mark stands up
the blonde grabs him and pulls him towards her
he pulls away
this isnt right
the blonde screams and drops to her knees
we have to have sex
the world is going to end
think of the children and little babies
mark looks down at this panicked helpless girl and feels really really bad about himself
just calm down for one second
mark walks over to the phone and picks it up
how can i be calm
the world might end any second
dont you to phone hello
thats very good news
good news indeed
mark hangs up the phone
the blonde is rocking back and forth on the bed in a fetal position
were going to be okay
the world isnt going to end
everyone is going to be fine
the blonde tackles him in a bear hug sobbing and laughing
were going to live
were going to live
the blonde falls onto the bed in exhaustion
this has been the worst
and the best
day of my life
okay i gotta go
oh no please stay
weve been through so much together
mark stares at this helpless girl for a moment
im an asshole
the blondes face and mood do an instant
well i hate assholes
get out of here
the blonde chucks her shoes at mark as he closes the door
mark walks across the parking lot
a look of total shock on his face
greg is in the exact same position mark left him in but hes twice as drunk
mark plops down next to him dazed and upset
that was one of the worst experiences of my life
did you invent a new kind of bike
what else would you do if you could do anything in the world
bone chicks asses
thats what id do
what else though
whats the second thing youd do
greg nods off
mark nudges him
what else would you do dipshit
id get money
id get all the money
greg passes out
mark nods his head takes the three full shots sitting in front of greg and does them all
lets do that
greg lets go
were going on a trip
greg immediately perks up
greg is driving mark rides shotgun both of them are completely plastered
thanks for driving man im completely plastered
im just as hammered as you
but i dont care if i get arrested
im trying to hit bottom
whoop whoop come the flashing lights of a cop car right behind them
greg begins to pull over
here comes bottom
mark looks worried
the cop comes to gregs window
nothing safer than pulling over two nerdy white guys in their forties
i dont want to go to jail
are you drunk
then youre going to jail
blow in here son
the cop pulls out a breathalyzer and holds it up to gregs mouth
dont do that
i dont think you can afford my bribe son
how much does it cost to bribe you
at least five grand
wow thats high
i need to feel that ive got some sense of integrity
greg blows in the breathalyzer
whoa thats off the charts
step out of the car son
youre drunk and going to jail
greg opens the door
hes not drunk
greg stumbles and falls passing out in the dirt
the cop stares at mark for a long beat while his brain wraps around this
the cop bangs his breathalyzer against his leg
damn thing must be broken
in the background we can hear greg vomiting profusely
the cop picks up greg and puts him back in the drivers seat
to greg son you might want to drive yourself to the nearest hospital
you have food poisoning or some kind of flu
mark is basically passed out vomit drooling down his chin
he couldnt look more drunk
the cop and mark stare at him for a beat
to mark maybe you oughta drive son
driving away with greg in the passenger seat a giant smile comes across marks face as he begins to laugh
that was awesome
stop laughing im sick
youre gonna be all right greg
greg vomits all over himself
stupid stomach flu
where are we going
mark pulls in front of the bellagio hotel and casino
both mark and a very hungover looking greg pop out of the car
mark hands the keys to the valet and they both stumble inside
its the bellagio
weve all been there
what are we doing here
we dont have any money to throw away
sure we do
mark pulls out a small wad of money
what is that a few hundred bucks
thats not going to last us very long
sure it will
mark and greg step up to the chip counter
mark slides his small wad through the window
the chip woman looks at his money
theres a very good chance youll lose all this money here tonight
and even if you do happen to win theres an even better chance that in the long run well win it back
some of the games are fixed
like all the ones that use computers
the woman slides him a short stack of chips
mark and greg walk towards the tables
mark and greg look around
a cocktail waitress approaches
if i could be a stripper i would but im not attractive enough
i have a stomach flu
well both have beers and well take them at that roulette table over there
mark points to a table and walks away
the waitress nods
oh come on roulette is the stupidest game of them all
its pure chance no skill whatsoever
im feeling lucky
youve never had a lucky day in your life
they arrive at the roulette table
get your bets in get your bets in
the house always wins in the long run
because of the zeros on the board every bet is slightly favored towards the house
mark puts his chips down on seventeen black
the dealer starts the wheel
the ball comes to a stop on twenty seven red
twenty seven red
no one wins
in full view mark slides his chips over to twenty seven red
im on twenty seven red
the dealer looks at this
his brain takes a moment to respond
we have a winner
the dealer stacks up marks new chips and pushes them over to him
you did it
you just like quadrupled your money
you lucky son of a bitch
mark puts all of his chips on double zero
a bunch of other people scatter their chips around the table as well
get your bets in get your bets in
the house always wins in the long run
fork over your money right here folks
i say this so often i want to kill myself
the dealer spins the ball
it comes to a halt on nine black
mark takes all of the chips on the table both his and everyone elses and slides them together into a giant pile and sits them right on nine black
im on nine black
these are all mine
the table cheers for mark
some people are a bit confused and a slight hubbub arises in the background i thought i had chips on the table
yeah me too
we must be drunk
that guys is lucky
even the dealer looks a bit confused
but gets over it quickly
nine black wins
the roulette dealer slides about five grand in chips over to mark
gregs jaw is on the floor
do it again
mark notices the confused people around him
i dont think i should
lets go play slots
mark is talking to a pit man right in front of a slot machine
hi i just won a major jackpot on this slot machine but no money came out
im sorry about that sir
let me get that fixed for you
and can i say congratulations sir
the pit man whispers a few words into his lapel mic
mark and greg each carrying four giant buckets overflowing with chips waddle through the casino
this is the most amazing night of my life
mark and greg lounge around the bellagio penthouse suite piles of chips and cash lying around them
greg is pacing delightedly
mark lies on the couch unsatisfied
it amazes me the winning streak youre on
you must be the luckiest man in the world
well sort of
it was like we couldnt lose
we couldnt lose
do you have a system
ive got a system
well with your system in just a few weeks i figure we could be the richest people in the world
and then what
well heres what im thinking
we take all the money in the world
and put it on black
why put it on black
why stop there
put it on a number and get thirty five times back
gregs eyes widen at the thought
thats exactly what well do
hold on i think i found a flaw in your plan
how can they pay us if we have all the money in the world
well theyd just have to
well they cant because weve got it all
well theyd better find it
they cant let us bet if theyre not going to pay us back
theyll have to just give us the casino
we already own the casino
weve got all the money in the world
well be betting against ourselves
then well go to another casino
we own that one too
we won that
so we own all the casinos
and if we win we cant pay us back because we already have all the money
greg thinks this over for a long beat
only one thing we can do then
take ourselves into the back room and break our own fingers
mark exhausted from his long night waits for the elevator to arrive
the elevator doors open and frank the depressive neighbor steps out
hey there frank
hows it going
pretty good thanks
frank stops and turns around this is a different response
i was doing some internet research last night about suffocation suicide
im probably going to give that a try tonight
mark gets in the elevator frank walks away
a short beat
mark exits the elevator and yells after frank
frank halfway out the building turns around
dont do it
frank thinks this over
and no one will care
youre a loser though
dont do it frank
things are going to be all right
youre going to meet someone soon
you wont be so lonely
things are going to turn around at your job
my jobs actually fine
well things are going to get better
better than they are
what about the depression
it will go away very soon
youre going to be happy soon frank
you just need to wait for it
listen to me you dont need to kill yourself
something changes in frank
a slight smile comes over him
man and that suffocation thing really seemed like a good idea
well my nights open now
you want to hang out later
i dont know
franks smile fades a tiny bit
lets hang out
ill see you after work
mark gets back in the elevator to the sound of frank laughing to himself as he exits the building
we hold on mark for a moment as he smiles and nods his head
mark sits at kitchen table pen and paper in hand
ive discovered something today very important
and very powerful
mark doing various good deeds throughout the day
o plays throughout
marks walks up to the homeless man with the i dont understand why im homeless and you are all not sign
he says something to the homeless man who quickly drops his sign and follows mark
im as excited as ive ever been in my entire life and equally scared
contd im writing this down in a letter in case this thing ive discovered somehow ends up killing me
i want to ensure that even if i wasnt strong enough to use it that my invention doesnt once again disappear never to be discovered again
mark and the homeless man are at the bank
mark is talking to the bank teller
the homeless man looks at mark nervously
the teller leaves and comes back with stacks and stacks of cash
in just a few hours since i stumbled upon my discovery i have seen its potential for evil and i have seen its potential for good
outside lecture films mark talks to the woman who was adamant about not wanting to go to work
he whispers a few words into her ear
she smiles picks up her briefcase and gladly walks into work
i must be careful with my discovery for at this point i barely understand it let alone think i have the power to control it
all i know is that if im not careful i could easily do irreparable damage to the world or even cause my own premature death
mark walks up to the arguing couple at the coffee shop who are now sitting at different tables not even looking at each other
he pulls up a chair next to each of them individually and says a few words to them
within moments the two of them are running into each others arms and making out passionately on the floor of the coffee shop
now to explain my invention
in essence my creation is the act of saying words that simply are not
for example if i tell someone that my eyes are blue then it simply becomes fact
i still know that indeed my eyes are brown but no one else is aware of this fact so therefore i have blue eyes
contd its a game of numbers there is only one of me who knows i have brown eyes and so many of them who do not
the numbers always win
mark is at the elderly home walking the halls and whispering to his grandmother and each elderly person he passes leaving each one of them with a smile upon their
faces and some with tears streaming down their cheeks
whoever is reading this go ahead and try it
tell someone your eyes are a different color then they are
i think youll be amazed at the results
its so simple and yet
this thing ive invented
mark and frank are watching tv in marks apartment
the two of them are drinking beers and having a good time watching television
au revoir future reader au revoir
mark signs his letter seals it in an envelope writes my invention on the outside of it and sticks it in a drawer in his kitchen
mark lies in bed watching tv
he picks up the phone and dials
are you gonna hang up on me again
im calling because i want to ask you out on another date
why would you do that
i discovered something yesterday
i found out i can pretty much have my life anyway i want it from now on
i gotta go
wait and i know you said you didnt want to date me ever again but im different now
things have changed
i think im in your league now
youre better looking
im not better looking
im just more
i think you have to see it for yourself
have you been to the gym
no i havent been to the gym
things are different for me now
you have to see this
i think youll hardly recognize me
did you buy better clothes
no look can we just meet up
there is silence on the other end of the phone
jennifer if there was even a glimmer of something about me that you liked please say yes
you even admitted that we got along well
just give me one more chance
just one little teensy tiny date
ill pick you up at eight
most likely itll be our last date though so just know that
thats very sweet
no it wasnt
did you not hear what i said
yeah no i was being
pause searching theres no word for it
see you tomorrow night
mark hangs up happily
in our world
in the s
pan on tv the screen is all black
came the greatest revolution of them all
climactic music the industrial revolution
the black fades to angelo badsmith a middle aged african american man sitting before a fire in a green smoking jacket holding a script
written by famed screenwriter rob marlowe and read by oscar winning reader angelo badsmith
hello im angelo badmsith
come watch me read about the exciting events that took place during the industrial revolution
angelo badsmith contd also i will tell you all about my personal misfortunes such as my wife who cheated on me with a man named perry
the screen reads the industrial revolution
back on mark his eyes are wide
the wheels in his head are spinning again
rob marlowe your streak of success has finally come to an end
suddenly mark jumps and runs to his kitchen table
he grabs a pen pulls out a sheet of paper
and begins writing
series of jump cuts mark writing furiously throughout the night piling up page upon page
by the time the sun comes up mark is exhausted with barely the energy to keep his head up as he writes the end and places the final page on
his large stack of finished pages
mark hustles through the parking lot manuscript in hand
he reaches the door and then stops remembering something
mark runs to the curb and throws his manuscript onto the dirty filthy street
he gets down on his hands and knees and rubs his manuscript into the grime making sure to get every page equally filthy
satisfied he organizes the pages into a neat pile and enters lecture films
mark walks the aisles of lecture films
people stop to stare at him
there is a whispered hubbub from the many cubicles and offices
mark passes his old office stopping to read the sign on the door th century closed
mark grimaces and keeps walking
hes gone crazy
mark turns his head to see shelley standing down the hall terrified staring at mark
mark ignores her and keeps walking
leaning against his door jamb is rob smirking as mark passes him
come to beg for your old job back
hey everybody heres the loser who thought the black plague would make for an interesting film
good luck douche bag
mark walks right up to the door that reads head of development anthony james
mark opens the door
anthony is on the phone his back to mark
theyre going to fire me any moment i just know it
im really really horrible at my job
i dont know anything about movies
i dont even like movies
i like sports
head of development what does that even mean
im not a smart person
okay talk to you later
anthony turns around to find mark
his face becomes very very scared
that was the head of the studio
im very scared that youre mad at me about the whole firing thing
im not mad at all
anthony is relieved
oh good because i feel really bad about it
i mean i would be horrible at your job too
i would be horrible at any job in this place
i love sports
they both stare at each other for a long beat
why are you here
mark pulls up a chair
when you fired me i was very depressed
i knew it
and so i left this building and i just started walking
and i walked all the way out of town
and then i walked into the desert and i fell asleep under a tree
i dont do well with other peoples life changing events
and when i woke up i found this strange old chest sticking out of the ground
so i started digging
and i unearthed a very old and ancient box
seven hundred years old
and inside the box
holding up manuscript was this
mark places his muddy dirty manuscript down on anthonys desk
anthony is scared to touch it
what is it
its a never before heard historical event from the past
when does it take place
the excitement drains from anthonys face
i told you were not interested in black plague movies here mark
this one isnt about the black plague
well it isnt just about the black plague
let me read you some of this
anthony rolls his eyes
anthony get excited about this
this is a brand new event from history that no one has ever heard before
its a great human discovery
yeah but is there a movie there
the greatest movie lecture films has ever made
anthonys eyes widen
mark picks up the manuscript and opens the first page
on the very first day of the fourteenth century a momentous occasion occurred
it began as a day much like any other
the sun rose the people awoke workers began to work babies began to cry
but all of that was interrupted when a giant flying space ship crashed down from the skies and landed in the heart of babylon
anthonys mouth drops to the ground
anthony picks up his phone and presses intercom
i want everyone in here now
weve got a big one
anthony hangs up
as the smoke cleared the door to the spaceship opened and inside were hundreds of beautiful half naked alien women
the room is filled with people now all of them hanging on every word mark reads from his manuscript
even rob and shelly lean against the back wall their minds blown by the story mark is telling
and then the ninja army unleashed a giant fireball that brought the robot dinosaur to its knees saving mars earth and the nude amazonian alien women all in one sweeping
the earth was saved
jebediah and aleena were allowed to marry by alien king xardon
it was to be the first human nude amazonian alien woman wedding and no expenses would be spared
all of babylon and mars were invited to join in the celebrations
people around the room wipe tears from their eyes
the wedding was held on a brisk summers day on mars with all of the survivors of the great ninja war and the black plague present
they feasted and danced and laughed and it was a joyous occasion
mark contd the moment the bride and groom kissed king xardon performed a mind wipe on all of the humans thereby erasing all knowledge of these events from their minds
and sent them back to babylon
for seven hundred years these events would be forgotten by mankind until one day a great writer by the name of mark bellison would stumble upon them in the desert
after being fired by his shit boss anthony and mocked by rob and shelly two huge douche bags
lecture films motion picture studios would go on to make the picture and it would be a big success and mark would become very wealthy and famous from it
the entire room bursts into applause
not just normal applause but massive epic applause
everyone crowds around mark hugging him touching him blown away by the magnanimity of the moment
mark tell us what its called
mark thinks it over for a moment and looks right at rob
to rob the black plague
everyone aahs and claps again
mark and jennifer sit at a candlelit table in the corner of a hip and fancy restaurant
jennifer looks beautiful
mark is on cloud nine
congratulations on selling your script today
thank you for having dinner with me
everyone needs to eat
and i enjoy your company
they both sip their drinks and look at their menus
the waiter comes up
im an extremely important waiter
what can i get you
i dont want to know what it is i just want to order the most expensive thing on the menu
ill have the duck
and i think you look like a little rat faced man
okay ill have those right up for you
the waiter leaves
mark and jennifer stare at each other for a short beat
something has changed between them and they can both feel it
things seem to be turning around for you
today is the best day of my life
its not every day you unearth a monumental historical event and sell it for a ton of money
that wasnt the best part
it was great but it wasnt the peak of my day
ive had a crush on you ever since i saw a picture of you on gregs refrigerator two years ago
the best part of my day today is right now sitting at this table here with you
youre the most beautiful woman ive ever seen in my life and youre special
and it makes me happy to be around you
jennifer is touched
but she doesnt reciprocate marks feelings
jennifer moves on
tell me something about your family
i really dont know much about you
ah my family
were what youd probably call not lucky
my whole family is kind of marked by tragedy bad luck and general
it goes back a long ways and could probably drive someone to suicide just hearing about it so ill keep it simple
my mom died when i was six
and my dad got real depressed and lost his job
out of work and with a kid to raise he had no choice but to turn to a life of crime
what kind of crime
he was a robber
nice mid to upper class home
lots of white wood
the house is very quiet until
the phone rings and the answer machine picks up
on answer machine hi im calling to let you know ill be robbing your house today
ill probably be there within the hour
i hope youre not there
the message ends
pan over to a soccer mom standing in the doorway
she drops her coffee and screams
he was a very unlucky man
he spent his last days behind bars
i never really knew him
sad moment pause but i guess ive also had a little luck in my life
i did have a wonderful grandmother who raised me
oh thats sweet
yeah shes great
where is she
old persons home obviously
who wants to live with that
i know right
but im going to get her out of there tomorrow
mark contd im going to buy her a big beautiful mansion where she can spend her few remaining days in luxury
the waiter arrives with their food
i dont know whats wrong with the chef today but these just look awful
he places them down
they look fine to me
well youre stupid
mark and jennifer begin eating
mark wants to say something and takes a moment to summon the courage
i was thinking that since im going to be rich and successful now that i might be in your league
and that maybe we could be together
what would be the point
mark didnt expect this answer
well i dont know maybe we might enjoy it
maybe wed be good together and could have a happy life raise a family together
jennifer thinks this over
well i do like you
and i enjoy your company
jennifer contd and if we were to get together and procreate i would like the offspring that are carrying half my genetic code to be well taken care of and
i also think youd make a good father and a good husband which i like
this is going well
unfortunately none of that changes the fact that youd still be contributing half of the genetic code to our children
i dont want short fat kids with little snub noses
and thats the end of that
mark takes a bite of his food
jennifer smiles and does the same oblivious to marks pain
marks cell phone rings
marks face melts in terror
mark bursts into the hospital room to find his grandmother martha looking tired and scared hooked up to dozens of machines the heart monitor beeping ominously
grandma they just called me
whats going on
are you okay
i dont know i fell on my way back to my room
what do the doctors say
they say ill probably die tonight
theres a knock on the door
the doctor enters
i was just coming in to check on her you must be martha bellisons grandson
what are you talking about shes going to die
it just doesnt look good
shes suffered a major heart attack and her heart is very weak her pulse not very strong her blood pressure is dropping rapidly and most likely shell have a fatal
heart attack during the night
the doctor checks marthas chart
yup still going to die
mark sits down next to martha in total shock
im sorry guys
i wish i felt something for you two but i really dont
i do this exact thing about thirty times a night and its really hardened me to human suffering
on a side note its fajita night at the cafeteria downstairs
you might think about grabbing a bite to eat there after your grandma dies
the doctor leaves
mark holds his grandmothers hand her hand is shaking
im so scared mark
i dont want to die
you know people dont talk about it much but death is a horrible thing
one minute youre alive theres a whole world around you humming and jumping people coming in and out doors opening and closing love and anger and the whole mess of
it all and then like that its all gone
this is it mark only a few hours left of this until an eternity of nothingness
the wheels in marks head are spinning again
suddenly the heart monitor starts beating rapidly and martha lurches in pain
mark immediately slams on the big red call nurse button holding his grandmother down as she lurches in pain
seconds later three nurses burst into the room
nurse begins filling a syringe
mark sits by his grandmothers head theyre both looking right at each other
listen closely to me grandma
i have a surprise for you
we focus on mark and his grandmother inches from one another as the paramedics busy themselves around marthas dying body
youre wrong about what happens when you die
its not an eternity of nothingness
martha is hanging on to every word mark is saying
when you die youre going to go to your favorite place in the whole world
and youre going to be with all of the people youve ever loved and who have ever loved you
and youre going to be young again and youll be able to run through the fields and dance and jump and there will be no sadness no pain just love
and laughing and happiness
there will be ponies made of gold and everyone will live in giant mansions and everything will smell like cookies
and it will last for an eternity grandma
tears are rolling down marthas face as a glimmering smile overtakes her face
mark looks up to see the nurses paramedics and doctors all staring at mark in total shock
what else happens
the cardiogram flat lines
do your jobs
everyone distractedly goes back to helping the grandmother
youre going to be happy forever grandma
i promise you
say hello to my mom for me
tell her i love her
again everyone has stopped helping martha theyre all listening intently
some of them are crying
im going to see my mother again when i die
tell us more please
martha stops breathing
the machine flatlines
and with that martha is gone
mark turns away from his grandmother
standing outside in the hallway is jennifer watching mark with true empathy in her eyes
mark and jennifer pull up in front of jennifers apartment
there is a long beat of silence
im so sorry mark
i think i just did something bad
do you want to come inside
mark nods his head
mark and jennifer sit side by side on her couch
mark holds a can of beer in his hand gently turning it around in his palm staring down at it vacantly
jennifer sadly watches mark
slowly and almost absentmindedly jennifers hand moves over and rests gently upon marks wrist settling there
we hold on them for a long beat
mark and jennifer have fallen asleep in the exact same position both of them sitting side by side no the couch her hand still on his wrist
mark opens his eyes and looks down at her hand then up at jennifer who slowly opens her eyes and smiles at him
they share a moment
a bleary eyed mark drives home from jennifers
as he turns onto his street he finds hundreds of cars blocking the way
a massive crowd of people are leaving their cars and walking
mark gets out of his car to find a wild scene hundreds of people camped out on the lawn of his apartment building
standing by his door is the nurse from the hospital
she immediately points at mark and screams
there he is
mark is bum rushed by a question asking throng
all of them are pelting mark with questions all of them confused and hopeful and desperately looking for answers
is there only one place you go when you die
will everyone who has ever died be there
whats this place called
will i get to have sex with people there
mark pushes through the crowd overwhelmed by it all
he gets to his door and opens it only to have the nurse step in his path and block the door
you owe us an explanation
if you know something this important you better tell us all
who are you people
the words you spoke last night to your grandmother spread like wildfire
please tell us more
explain what you said
fine fine just give me a minute
mark pushes past her and into his building closing the door behind him
mark goes to his fridge and pulls out a beer
his mind is reeling
as he opens a drawer to get a bottle opener he sees the letter my invention
mark eyes it ominously
the phone rings
mark screens the call
leaving message youve been gone for twenty minutes and i turn on the t
v to see you on every station
whats going on
this is seriously the weirdest thing
mark picks up the phone
remember last night when i said i think i did something bad
well now i know i did something bad
theyre saying that you know something different about what happens after you die
mark walks into his bedroom and turns on the tv
sure enough theres a newscaster on his lawn giving a report with a banner on the screen that reads new death discoveries
mark puts down the phone and listens to the t
twenty four hours ago mark bellison was just your typical nobody writer
reporter on t
v contd today people are saying he knows new information about what happens after you die
mark puts the phone to his ear again
mark what do you know
what did you tell your grandmother last night
whats going on
i cant explain it all right now
why dont you come over
jennifer pushes through the throng of people which is now even larger than before
as she reaches the door mark opens it for her and slides her through
come up quick they look like they could get out of hand any second
mark hurries jennifer into the elevator
jennifer sits on the couch while mark agitated beyond recognition paces the room
just tell me what you told your grandmother
i dont think i should
who knows what could happen next
im just going to keep my mouth shut from now on
what you said obviously affected a lot of people
i dont think you have the choice to keep it in now
sure i do
i could just walk out that door and get on a plane and go to namibia
no one knows me in namibia
just tell me what you said
my grandmother was dying and she was terrified shaking all over
she didnt want to just become nothingness
so i told her that when she died there wouldnt be nothingness
that she would be with all of the people she loved who had died and that she would live an eternity of joy and happiness
jennifers heart skips a beat
barely able to speak how do you know these things
mark sighs and looks out the window
the crowd extends down the block all of them sitting calmly on his lawn talking quietly to each other trying to make sense of it all
jennifer gets up and stands beside mark
you have to tell them everything you know
this is too big
you have no choice
but you dont understand
the words i said
its not right
how did your grandmother feel when you told her these things
and how did that make you feel
sweeping her hand over the crowd think how good it will feel to do the same for all of these people
mark thinks this over
but i need a few hours to get my thoughts together
ill go tell them
are you sure this is right
of course it is
you know something thats going to change mankind forever
its the most important thing the world has ever heard
jennifer leaves the room
mark alone with his thoughts sits down at his kitchen table pulls out a few sheets of paper grabs a pen and starts writing
marks neighborhood is a sea of candles
the crowd has grown beyond measure
a massive sea of people all holding candles all waiting quietly like serene cows for mark to come down and make his announcement
mark is hunched over his table writing
theres a knock at the front door
greg walks in with a large pizza and beer
i brought pizza
how come you never told me we all get mansions
jennifer comes out of the bedroom and quickly shhhs greg
inventing the bicycle is one thing but this
let him work
jennifer pulls greg away from mark
mark goes back to work
mark puts down his pencil and places both written sheets next to each other
he has finished
mark opens the door
jennifer and greg are on his bed watching t
the same newscaster stands outside the building
in seoul korea they wait
in rome italy they wait
in london england they wait
in new york city they wait
the world has come to a standstill everyone at their televisions and radios or here on this lawn waiting for mark bellison to come forth and tell the people what
mark waves his manuscript in the air
jennifer and greg jumps off the bed
are you ready
they head towards the door
i feel like i should be reading these off of something other than just notebook paper
i wish they were like written on large tablets or even just nicer paper or something
greg grabs an empty pizza box off of the counter rips it into two pieces and tapes his two pages onto them
mark holds the two halves of the pizza boxes awkwardly and nods his head
mark looks at jennifer and greg with fear in his eyes
just tell them what you know good luck out there man
ots of newscaster cameraman
the newscaster is interviewing a young man with marks apartment building in the background
i heard that he said we all get mansions and that theres even ponies
to cameraman ponies
these are the things we can all expect when we die
what else can we expect
we wont know until mark bellison steps out of that
mark cracks open the front door and steps out onto his front steps with jennifer right behind him
the newscaster and cameraman run to get into position
mark looks out at the sea of people staring silently at him waiting for answers
a man runs up and hands mark a microphone
his voice echoes through the neighborhood
you could hear a pin drop
no one is even breathing
i guess youve all heard the things i told my grandmother last night and
i understand why youre here
some very important things
and im going to share these things with you now
intercut throughout different video feeds people listening to radios standing in the cold watching tvs through store windows all around the world
mark takes a deep breath and holds up his pizza box commandments
everything you want to know is written here
on this old pizza box
mark looks out at the crowd all of them so hopeful so needy
mark looks back at jennifer and greg who give him a proud nod
number one there is a man who lives in the sky who controls everything
interrupting shouting whoa whoa whoa
what does he look like
mark wasnt prepared for questions
a good head of hair
what ethnicity is he
making it up as he goes hes a new ethnicity
its like a mix of all of our ethnicities
does he live on a cloud
can we see him
becoming confident no
he lives much higher than the clouds too high to see
so he lives in space
no not that high
so you mean the thermosphere
look people i got a lot to get through here
im just telling you what i know man
lives in the sky
you cant see him
number two when you die you dont disappear into an eternity of nothingness
instead you go to a really great place
number three in that place every person will get a mansion
what kind of mansion
i dont know
whatever kind of mansion youre thinking of right now
i wasnt thinking of a mansion
a lot of people echo this sentiment
i was thinking of a horrible mansion
look its the best mansion you can think of not just now but ever
whatever the best mansion for you can possibly be thats the one youll get
number four when you die all the people you love will be there too
will they have their own mansions
yes of course
everyone gets a mansion
what if i want them to live in my mansion
if they want to live with you they can leave their mansion and live in yours
what happens to their mansion
i dont know it goes back on the market
what about the people i hate
will they be there too
where are they
okay theyre probably there but youll never see them
theyre far off too far for you to get there
but what if they try to find me
they hate you too
but what if they dont
what if they love me but i hate them
well then youre just
youll both be fine with it
theres only love there okay
number five when you die there will be free ice cream
whatever flavor you can think of
what even bad flavors
but why would you eat bad flavors
well you just said every flavor i can think of
oh no i just thought about vanilla and skunks
well dont eat it then
ive just thought the chocolate sauce is diarrhea
well dont put it on then
whats wrong with you people
mark contd number six if you do bad things you wont get to go to this great place when you die
where will you go
a terrible place
the worst place imaginable
a rumble of terror moves through the crowd
what constitutes a bad thing
things like that
you have to tell us all the things or else we might do them and it wouldnt be our fault
the whole crowd echoes this sentiment
is punching someone bad
what if theyre trying to hurt you
then its fine
is cursing bad
what about being late for work
thats fine too
i mean you might lose your job if your boss doesnt like it but it wont effect what happens after you die
what about if you forget to feed your dog
that also is fine
unless the dog dies
then its bad
if you do just one bad thing do you go to the bad place
thinking about it three chances
if you do three bad things youre out
kind of yes
theres a hubbub throughout the crowd its like baseball i love baseball im scared of the bad place
about fifty people stand up and ask their questions at the same time
look can we just move on
we have to know everything thats bad
lets start with you
is it bad to wear pants
theres no hairstyle that will put you in the bad place
like ive told you the main things are hurting people physically on purpose taking peoples stuff doing things to people they dont want done killing people on purpose
are we good
the crowd nods apprehensively
many of the people in the crowd are crying
one of the crying men shaking like a leaf stands up with terror in his eyes
ive done many of those bad things
is there anything i can do to not go to the bad place
help me im so scared
well you didnt know about these bad things until i told you just now so youre fine
am i fine
what about me
tons of people shout similar sentiments
youre all fine
im only talking about people who do bad things starting right now
everyone else is fine
the crowd erupts in a massive cheer
people hug each other passionately wiping tears from their eyes
number seven the man in the sky who controls everything decides if you go to the good place or the bad place
he also decides who lives and who dies
does he cause natural disasters
did he cause my mom to get cancer
did he cause that tree to land on my car last week
the crowd is quiet for a long beat
theyre mulling this over
the first man to speak is a blue collar guy with a thick brooklyn accent
i say fuck the guy that lives in the sky
the whole crowd erupts in agreement
people stand up shouting flicking off the sky
that guys a fucking asshole
that motherfucker better hope i never see him face to face
that guys a fucking coward
hiding up there and doing bad shit to us
why doesnt he do it to our faces
we need to stop that motherfucker before he kills us all
mark looks worried
he didnt anticipate this
suddenly a thought occurs to him
everyone quiets down
this guy who lives in the sky and controls everything is also responsible for all the good stuff that happens
the whole crowd aaaahhs
hes the guy who saved my life on that fishing trip when the boat capsized
did he capsize the boat
hes the one who killed my grandmother and left me those millions of dollars
so is he the same one who cured my moms cancer
the crowd thinks this over
so hes kind of a good guy but hes also kind of a prick too
but check this out number eight even if the man in the sky does bad shit to you he makes it up to you by giving you an eternity of
good stuff after you die
the crowd aaahhs again
as long as you dont do any of the bad stuff you listed right
so its kind of a test
well thats it
thats everything i know
mark looks out at the crowd theyre all exhausted their minds completely blown
the nurse who started this all steps forward
how do you know these things
the man in the clouds told me
yeah but how come were just learning these things now millions of years into our existence
i dont know he forgot or something
i gotta go people good night
mark takes jennifer by the hand and pulls her back inside his building
mark jennifer and greg wait for the elevator all of them exhausted
you think that went well
the doors open and they get inside
all three of them stare ahead mark looking exhausted jennifer and greg with their minds completely blown
as the doors close and we spinning magazines and newspaper headlines proclaim mansion for everyone almost nasa searching for man in the sky finally a reason to do good time
man of the year mark bellison mansion prices plummet worldwide cult of bellison await further answers man in sky murders forty two in earthquake man in sky continues to give aids to babies workplace productivity down fourteen percent everyone daydreaming about mansions
mark is at lecture films turning in the script for the black plague to anthony
rob gives mark a dirty look as he passes him in the hall
mark smiling proudly stands behind the camera while nathan goldfrappe reads his script
in the background are jennifer and greg hanging out on set
jennifer can be seen chatting with rob by craft services
mark removes the for sale sign from the front yard of a brand new beautiful home
jennifer and greg congratulate mark enthusiastically
mark and jennifer are walking down the street together when mark stops to point out a new building with a sign that reads a quiet place to think about the
man in the sky
the building boasts a large stained glass window portraying mark holding the two halves of the pizza box
mark jennifer and greg laugh it up in a stretch limousine as it pulls up to the movie premier of the black plague
mark jennifer and greg walk the red carpet at the premier of the black plague
mark is the center of attention
rob stops by on the red carpet to say hello to jennifer and whisper something into her ear
mark and jennifer have dinner together the best of friends but as they cheers their champagne glasses there is a tinge of sadness in marks eyes
a disheveled mark unshaven and sloppy looking sits in a reclining chair wearing boxers and a bathrobe drinking a beer
beer cans are littered everywhere
a young gay man in a suit stands before him with a pad and a pen writing down everything mark says
so then the flying duck flew all the way to alaska where it met up with a polar bear who could talk
and the polar bears name was martin
and the polar bear was wearing a green cape
and martin and the flying duck both had race cars with their names printed on the side and
jennifer enters the room upset
i just saw three people climbing the fence into your backyard
you really need to think about getting better security
noticing beer cans mark how many of those have you had
jennifer grabs the beer out of marks hand
continuing glaring at but then the evil goblin witch came in and stole the flying ducks race car and made the flying duck very angry
grabbing at his beer
mark contd luckily the polar bear was there to snatch the race car back
but he misses unfortunately the witch was a smart witch and the polar bear was powerless
is that the end
thats a strange ending
hey dont look at me its the man in the skys story
you want me to take this over to lecture films
tell them to shoot that one this week
the assistant walks away
tell them its for kids
jennifer glares at mark disappointed
you havent left the house in weeks
every time i come by youre just sitting here writing down stories you get from the man in the sky
hey hes the boss
dont you think you should go outside sometime
you know theres about five thousand people on our lawn waiting to ask you questions
jennifer sits down next to him
whats with you
you seem sad
i dont get it
youre a very successful writer youve won countless awards and oscars
jennifer waves towards a shelf full of oscars and various other awards
youve changed the way people see the world the way they see death and life
youve made the entire world happy
not the entire world
the one person who should be happy the person who has everything
what else do you want
mark sits up in his chair and looks right at jennifer
id trade it all in for you
all of it
jennifer sighs and sits down beside him
well youve got me
as a friend
not sarcastic yeah
mark contd but why cant we be together
why cant you be with me
because of the whole snub nosed thing
with kids your genetics
you know fat short
stopping her yeah
its almost a shame that being rich and powerful and famous doesnt change your genetics
it would be great if it changed your genetic material because i really love you but i just dont
suddenly mark has an idea
he looks right at jennifer
it does change your genetics
jennifer lights up
mark stares at her for a short beat
he cant go through with it
no it doesnt
our kids would be short and fat with little snub noses
anyway ive come to tell you i cant go to the movies with you tonight
ive got a date
mark stands up
youve got to be fucking
hes a complete and total asshole
not to me
hes very sweet and kind to me
well of course he is look at you
i mean for fucks sake a shark would be nice to you
well no i mean
dont go out with him
hes a great match for me
whats he got that i dont
we talked about this
if you and i got together it wouldnt be fair to our kids
they have the right to be attractive and have good genes
if rob and i get married you can move into our mansion with us when we all die
i dont want to move into your fucking mansion
and what are you doing thinking about marriage with him already
you havent even gone on one date
mark sits down
its like nothings changed
a lot of things have changed
i wish you could be happy
theres a knock at the front door
hes picking you up here
it was his idea
mark stands up in shock and follows jennifer to the front door
she opens the door to find rob looking handsome and arrogant
wow i cant wait to have sex with you
rob notices mark in his boxers and a bathrobe
oh hey there mark
you look like trash
to jennifer come on jennifer lets go have some fun
and then have some sex
jennifer turns back to mark sad that hes upset
ill call you tomorrow
the door closes and mark is left standing there alone
greg dressed in a bathrobe and looking even more slovenly than mark waddles up behind him
who was that
mark and greg are shit faced sitting around marks giant swimming pool
hey watch this
yelling over the fence about forty voices shout back hes talking to us
maybe he has more answers
the man in the sky just told me something
mark snickers to himself
greg drunk and stupid cant help but snicker too
youre all gay
mark and greg explode laughing
from the other side of the fence we can hear people mumbling shock
i am gay
i always knew it
this is going to be awkward for my husband
mark and greg almost roll into the pool theyre laughing so hard
the people on the other side of the fence arent laughing whos my real mother
this explains so much dad why didnt you tell me
i dont know why were laughing
its really probably very sad for those people
im gettin a beer
mark hobbles up and walks into the house
moments later he emerges with two cokes
out of beer
mark tosses greg a coke and sits down on his chaise lounge cracking open his coke and taking a sip
i want to do something big again
like telling the people what happens when they die
that felt good
i gotta do something big like that again
maybe the man in the sky will tell you something new
mark looks down at his can of coke
close on coke can the warning label is extremely long and written in very small type
it starts with coke is very bad for you
the following are diseases physical ailments and general health issues that coke might cause the label then goes on to list dozens of ailments
marks eyes scan down to the very bottom of the label where it says simply if you still want to drink coke do so at your own risk
mark looks over to find greg staring at the depressing label as well
ugh this shit is so bad for you
i really shouldnt drink this
mark stares at this label for a moment thinking
with his hand he covers everything on the label except for please enjoy coke
he smiles widely
what if i told you that drinking coke was good for you
greg turns to him his face full of hope
and not just coke
but all the delicious foods youre not supposed to eat
what if they were all of a sudden really really good for you
it would be the happiest day of my life
a dozen high powered executives from all over the globe sit around a massive board room table
the head seat at the table is unoccupied
they mumble back and forth to each other unsure why theyre there
mark bursts into the room in a suit looking very manicured
gentleman thank you all for coming here on such short notice
i have some very big news for you all today
is it from the man in the sky
nope this one i came up with all on my own
and its going to change the way you all do business
mark hits a button and a projection screen comes down on the far wall
mark starts a slide show
up until now all products sold worldwide have warning labels printed on them
warnings like these
series of slides we see the same warning we just saw on the coke can a commercial jet with this plane might crash four of our other ones did printed
on its side a car dashboard light reading this car will ignite upon impact always and a sticker on a grocery store package of ground meat that reads injected with hormones that make it taste better but will eventually give you cancer
as you can see a lot of these products can be very depressing
they remind people of all the horrible things that can happen to them in life
people hate thinking about horrible things
yeah but they have to know those things
executive contd they have to be able to protect themselves
i dont want to hurt anyone
especially now that i know about the bad place
everyone in the room shudders
hear me out fellas
allow me to introduce you to the future of your companies
mark changes the slide to a can of coke that simple reads coke tastes great
and its good for you
everyone in the room ahhhs
where can i get some of that healthy coke
its the same coke as before
the executives all squint their eyes
but this one is healthy
and it tastes great
do you have any samples
guys its the same coke on the inside
ive just changed the outside
somehow by changing the outside hes also changed the inside
everyone aaahs in understanding
mark sighs and changes the slide to that of a commercial airliner with the words completely safe writing on the outside
oh thank goodness
ive always hated flying
what an invention
how did you do it
i didnt do anything guys
i made this on my computer last night
the plane is exactly the same as it was before
nobody in the room gets it
thats the only plane ill ever fly on again
thats the point here guys
with these new advertising strategies people will buy your products with abandon
but it will take years to replace all of our stock with these new improved products youve invented
all you have to do is print these words on the packaging
mark changes the slide again the car dashboard light now reads this car prevents crashes and another slide that shows a package of meat with a sticker reading this meat
actually cures cancer
even if you dont understand it just start shipping these products out to people as you see them here and youre all going to get very very rich
how did you do it
look theyre still the same products you have on the shelves right now
the only difference now is that people wont get bummed out or scared when they use them
isnt that a good thing
the executives all nod their heads in agreement and rise to shake marks hand
gentleman if youll excuse me i have five thousand gay orphans on my front lawn that are going bananas
we follow a suburban housewife as she pushes her shopping cart through the aisles of a bright and shiny super market
she picks up a six pack of coke and notices the label new coke it tastes great
and its good for you
the housewife smiles widely and enthusiastically tosses it in her cart
series of cuts the housewife grabbing different products marveling at the new improved features cures sadness
tastes better than real chicken
this candy is all your body needs to survive
with a full cart the housewife wheels it to the checkout counter to find swarms of people already there all of their carts bursting to the brim with new exciting
everyone looks excited and happy
back at his old stomping ground mark sits at the bar by himself drinking coffee and watching the tv
greg sits next to him with two boxes of cookies and a liter of coke in front of him
different newspapers are spread out on the bar all of them with similar headlines world rocked by new healthy products people everywhere line up for guilt free treats angle on
tv a fat man is being interviewed in front of a super market he holds a bag full of junk food in front of him
thank the man in the sky for this
ive never been happier in my life
now i can eat whatever i want whenever i want
the man takes a bite of a twinkie and wavers a bit like hes going to pass out
are you all right sir
the man steadies himself
i must just be real happy
it says on the wrapper that they help boost your happiness
the man smiles but hes obviously not feeling well
hes watching the tv with a bit of worry on his face
he turns to greg who is eating a stack of cookies and washing it down by gulping from a liter of coke
you should slow down there greg
just because the package says its not bad for you doesnt mean you have to gorge yourself on it
but it tastes so good
greg shoves three more cookies into his mouth
thats just stupid
no its not
greg holds up the package of cookies and points to the disclaimer which reads these cookies make you smarter
you look sad
here have a brownie
theyll cheer you up
greg hands mark a brownie that sure enough says theyll cheer you up
right on the package
i wish that worked for me greg
ill see you around
mark gets up and leaves
mark drives while we take in a bit of his world highlighting the various changes hes wrought
a homeless man stands on the street corner with a sign that now reads screw it
ill be in my mansion soon
he has a big smile on his face
the same business man pulls up beside marks car this time eating a giant donut and talking loudly into his cell phone
im not talking to anyone on my cell phone
but from a distance i look very important and busy
at a red light mark eavesdrops on the same arguing couple
no i wont move into your mansion with you when we die
youre really smothering me
the more you push me away the more attracted i am to you
a bus passes in front of marks car
the ad now reads pepsi
just as good as coke
a car honks behind mark
the man leans out of his car and yells at mark
move it fatty
as the man passes him he looks at mark and pulls up beside him
hey youre mark bellison
so are you going to apologize
the honking man speeds away
mark sits in front of the gravesite of his grandmother
angle on her tombstone which reads martha bellison
lived an average life for a woman in her time
nothings really changed
i gave people the man in the sky made myself rich and successful told the world they can eat whatever they want and feel good about it
everyones happy but me
because im the only one who knows it all
i made it all up
youre not up there living in a mansion
youre right here
in the ground
and im the only one who knows that
and the one thing i want i cant have
because the world is too stupid to change
the world only cares about what they can see and what they can know and what theyre used to and what
no one listens to what they really want
and thats why ill always just be a loser grandma
and thats why ill always be alone
with a beer bottle in his hand mark searches through his kitchen drawers for a bottle opener
he opens a drawer and something catches his eye
angle on the envelope which reads my invention
slowly mark pulls it out of the drawer and stares at it
the sound of his front door opening startles him and mark shoves the envelope into his back pocket
can i come in
jennifer enters the kitchen
havent seen you much lately
ive been busy with work and things
and im getting married
thats why i came over
to tell you
dont do it
the wedding is tomorrow
jennifer pulls out an invitation mark waves it away
i hope youll come
mark shrugs and jennifer puts the invitation back in her purse
no point really
it would make me happy
being around you makes me happy
mark turns towards her
so dont marry him
i only have a few years to marry someone with good genes and financial stability so i can have children and the family ive always wanted
one day ill be old and wrinkly and ugly
no you wont
not to me you wont
i love you
if you really love someone it doesnt matter what they look like
what do you mean
do me this favor
just one favor
dont accept everything you see
dont just do something because thats the way its done
youre confusing me
think about what you want
find out what you really want
and if its not the same as what i want well then ill know that and ill never darken your doorstep again
i want you
what do you want
jennifer and mark stare at each other for a long beat
im going to go
will you just stay a little bit longer
i dont want to be alone
just sit with me
mark leads her into the living room and they sit down far apart from each other on the couch
mark turns the tv on and they both sit in silence
mark has fallen asleep on the couch
jennifer checks her watch and stands up
she takes out her wedding invitation and lays it on the coffee table by mark
she unfolds a blanket and is about to place it on him when she notices an envelope sticking out of his back pocket
she pulls it out and looks at it
she opens the letter and begins to read
once finished she folds up the letter and hurriedly leaves scared and confused
mark wakes up and sees jennifers wedding invitation on the coffee table
mark stands before the mirror dressed in a suit putting on a tie
greg pokes his head into the room dressed in a suit as well
were gonna be late
the sign outside reads a quite place to think about the man makes sense people would start getting married at these places
i mean who you marry decides whos mansion youre going to live in one day
its a big decision
they enter the building
a small stage sits before a large stained glass window portraying mark holding the two halves of the pizza box
rob stands at the altar
mark and greg take their seats amidst a crowd of people sitting quietly in their chairs
jennifer sits in a small room in a beautiful white dress looking as beautiful as any woman has ever looked
she stares absentmindedly out the window
theres a knock at the door
jennifers mother pokes her head in
its time dear
jennifer doesnt answer
we push in on jennifer to see shes clutching marks letter in her hand
i dont feel all right
do you have food poisoning
i dont think theres a word for what i have
heres comes the bride plays over an organ and jennifer walks down the aisle towards a smiling rob
mark watches her in awe stunned by her beauty
rob notices mark staring at jennifer and mouths loser at him
jennifer reaches the altar and stands across from rob
the wedding overseer an elderly man in a suit stands between them holding a few sheets of paper in his hand
we are sitting here in this building today to share in the wedding of rob and jennifer
two young attractive people who have agreed that this union would be mutually beneficial and that their genetic match up would most likely produce favorable offspring and a life of
financial stability and physical security
both rob and jennifer nod at each other
rob do you promise to stay with jennifer for as long as you want to and to protect your offspring for as long as you can
jennifer do you promise to stay with rob for as long as you want to and to protect your offspring for as long as you can
jennifer doesnt respond
to overseer im sorry hold on one second
to rob rob can i ask you something
theres a slight hubbub in the room
mark perks up
but what are you doing
what color are my eyes
oh theyre brown
close on jennifers eyes
indeed they are brown
no rob theyre blue
rob looks again
mark stirs in his seat amazed by what hes hearing
oh look at that
so they are
youve got pretty blue eyes
push in on jennifer
her mind is reeling
can we get on with this
jennifer do you promise to stay with rob for as long as you want to and to protect your offspring for as long as you can
jennifer is confused
her mind is fighting it but she doesnt know what exactly shes fighting
there is a sigh of relief from the room
mark shakes his head in sadness
before i pronounce these two man and wife is there anyone here who thinks theyd offer either of these people a better genetic match up
mark bolts up in his chair
the whole room gasps
oh come on
look at you
you cant be better
yes i can
youve got shmuck genes
and i love her
to jennifer jennifer dont marry him
is this what you really want
i dont know
pause unsure yes
mark thinks this over for a beat
awkwardly mark makes his way to the aisle and leaves the room
the room is thick with tension
are we married yet
because ive got plans this afternoon
mark loosens his tie as he walks out of the building and towards the street
in the background we can see the church door open
hold on a minute
mark turns confused and tired
jennifer runs to him
she stands before him they both stare at each other
jennifer pulls out marks letter and shows it to him
so am i
is any of it
the things you said
i cant think of the word
is there a man in the sky
whyd you say there was
because i couldnt cope with the look on my grandmothers face
but how could you say something that
im not sure
i just did it
and what did you mean that i could grow old and ugly and still be beautiful to you
i mean just that
youll always be beautiful to me
but what if my looks
it doesnt matter
i feel funny
everything is so hard
nothing is easy anymore
there is a long moment of silence
jennifer moves closer to mark and looks directly into his eyes
i know what i want
i want short fat kids with little snub noses
the biggest smile weve ever seen comes across marks face
thats an easy one
just like she did the night on her couch jennifer reaches over and puts her hand on marks wrist
they both stare at each other for a long beat holding hands love beaming from both of them
the world is changing before their eyes
does anyone else know about your invention
but im sure it wont be long
should we tell them right away
im not sure
i dont think everyone will understand
greg sticks his head out of the church door
whats going on out here
everyones just sitting in there
are we gonna finish this wedding
jennifer smiles at mark
mark smiles back
praise the man in the sky
we rise up as mark and jennifer walk hand in hand towards the church and an unknowable future
the worlds last moment of honesty
a monumental occasion in the history of mankind
that lowly writer who stumbled upon the ability to lie went on to become one of the most important men of his age married to one of the most beautiful
women of his time and passed on the lying gene to generations to come
a world without honesty is a world with dreams
a world with pretense
a world with fiction
a world with flattery
and most importantly a world with true love
put simply a world very much like our own
