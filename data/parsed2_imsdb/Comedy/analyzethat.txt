screenplay by peter steinfeld and harold ramis and peter tolan based on characters created by kenneth lonergan and peter tolan june draft two men caesar and marty ducks stand at
the end of the deserted bar talking quietly oblivious to the exotic dancer grinding her pelvis on a pole in the middle of the small stage
body language and charisma tell us that caesar is the boss ducks his lieutenant
he hates your fuckin guts
brooding i dont know
who else knew about the money
and how did peezee know they popped tony cisco when we didnt even hear about it til last night
sighs heavily i dont know
pressing what is so hard to understand here
you said yourself peezee was a mamaluke and you couldnt trust him
now suddenly youre soft on the guy
i just dont think it was him
okay ill bite
if not peezee then who
slowly rising to his full height i think it was you ducks
caesar starts to walk away as the bartender now holding a sawed off shotgun moves closer to ducks
the exotic dancer splits in a hurry through a curtain at the back of the stage
scared you gotta be kiddin
caesar stops at the door where two of his soldiers have
appeared holding automatic weapons
caesar you know me
what kind of fuckin idiot would i have to be to try that shit with you
a dead fuckin idiot
as he walks out the door the soldiers open fire on marty ducks
caesar doesnt look back
the title credits come up on the made for cable series weve been watching little caesar
clapping and cheering from maximum security prisoners are gathered around watching their favorite show in the rec room
in the front row is paul vitti former new york crime boss and a couple of other wiseguys
change the channel
the wiseguy gets up and starts switching channels on the tv
a couple of convicts in the back start to protest
whatre you doin asshole
vitti turns and stares at them
they fall silent immediately
didnt mean any disrespect
vitti turns the page and sees a huge headline in the post mob shrink tells all
he gets up agitated
im going to bed
vitti stands up and heads back to his cell
as vitti approaches his cell he sees a prison guard standing by
his cellmate earl a giant of a man comes out of their cell carrying his bedroll and a box containing his other meager possessions
suspicious whats goin on earl
theyre transferring me
shrugs dont know
thanks for looking out for me mr
take it easy
he notices something in the box
is that my after shave
blanches im sorry
i just grabbed stuff i didnt know thats okay
see you around
earl exits with the guard
vitti hesitates a moment then warily steps into his cell
the cellblock is quiet
a guard stops outside the darkened cell looks around to make sure no one is watching then
pulls out a gun with a silencer reaches through the bars and fires repeatedly into vittis shadowy form under the blanket
then he slips away as quietly as he appeared
on his exit we pan down to vitti unhurt curled up under his bunk
a deluxe casket flanked by elaborate floral displays and an easel displaying a portrait of the deceased dr
mourners fill the pews standees at the back an overflow crowd
ben sobel sits in the front row staring at the casket with his wife laura his son michael now a teenager bens mother and her friend dr
at the podium the rabbi is speaking
and now id like to call on isaacs son dr
ben sobel who would like to say a few words
ben rises and crosses solemnly to the podium
addressing audience its very difficult for me to talk about my father because in a sense im talking about two men
one of course is the public isaac sobel the eminent psychotherapist and popular author known to millions of readers around the world
laura michael and bens mother listen proudly to the eulogy
the second isaac sobel is the private man my father dad
and for those of you who knew him well and knew our family well lets face it my father was a psychotic mind fucking prick
an arrogant abusive ego inflated a ringing cell phone interrupts him
still seated in the front row daydreaming
the ringing continues as all the mourners and even the rabbi discreetly check their cell phones
then ben realizes its his fumbles for the phone in his jacket pocket and answers it
the mourners mutter
guess who you fuck
ben turns away from laura
to laura i have to uh take this
into phone this isnt a good time
vitti is disheveled his hair messed his shirt buttoned wrong
not a good time
let me explain something to you
im in fucking hell right now
this is not a good time
sotto voce i cant talk right now
my father died
so what does that have to do with me
call me later dont hang up on sobel
theyre tryin to kill me
ben hangs up
he stands there for a long beat just staring the dial tone buzzing in his ear
vitti and another wiseguy pass through the cafeteria line with their trays
vitti now looks catatonic
ooh they got tapioca
i love tapioca
looks at vitti you all right paul
vitti just stares wild eyed actually drooling a little
can i have your tapioca
a guard the one who tried to kill him watches vitti from his post
then he nods to someone across the room
coyote a heavily muscled and tattooed gang member nods in response
vitti walks past the table where coyote is sitting with other tough hispanic gang members
to vitti hey fredo
or is it guido
his friends laugh
vitti stops and stares dumbly at them
just keep walkin don corleone
there is a tense moment then vitti bursts out laughing
vitti laughs harder strangely manic
i said shut up bitch
but vitti cant stop
he drops his tray of slop splattering food on the men
coyote leaps to his feet and pulls a shiv
youre a dead man jefe
coyote lunges at vitti with the knife but vitti suddenly whirls around bashes coyote in the face with his food tray and bursts into song
singing with appropriate dance moves when youre a jet youre a jet all the way from your first cigarette to your last dyin day
prisoners and guards stare at him like hes nuts
coyote stabs at him again but vitti dodges and smashes him over the head with the tray
when youre a jet if the shit hits the fan you got brothers around youre a family man
youre a dead man jefe
coyote rushes him but vitti sidesteps and hits him in the face
guards move in from all sides
vitti jumps up on the tabletop to escape them
kicking at them singing i like to be in america okay by me in america
the guards drag him down and cuff his hands behind him then carry him out stiff as a board
tonight tonight wont be just any night a limo pulls up to an old but well maintained suburban house the family gets out and starts walking to the house
the family crosses to the front door
sighs deeply i cant believe hes gone
i cant believe what you said about him
cold and withholding
you had to tell everybody
why didnt you just take a swing at the casket
ben opens the front door and they go in
the family enters the foyer
okay i might have strayed from my notes a little
im dealing with a lot of stuff here
grief is a process
laura notices fbi agents cerrone and miller waiting for them in the living room
cerrone is an attractive woman in her late twenties wearing a dangerously short skirt
miller is a clean cut man in his thirties
sobel im agent miller this is special agent cerrone federal bureau of investigation
wed just like to ask you a few questions if we could
testy can i ask what this is about
we just came from the cemetery
we know this is a difficult time for you dr
sorry about your father
thank you im going to miss him
ben gestures for them to sit
laura and michael both look at him doubtfully
i mean there were issues as i think there are with any father and son
he wasnt especially warm ben once today
no im just saying in spite of all that agent cerrone crosses her legs a move that does not go unnoticed by ben and michael
he was a great great legs
sobel you received a call this morning from paul vitti
laura shoots him a look
what makes you think paul vitti called me
because we monitor and record all his phone calls from sing sing
that was him on the phone
and you didnt tell me
talk about withholding
you told her nodding at agent cerrone you told her at the drop of a hat
agents cerrone and miller eye each other
shes with the f
she needs to know these things
oh i see
and i dont
why tell laura
she couldnt possibly handle a phone call
did i say that
you folks need a minute
no were fine
if you dont need me anymore ill be in the kitchen
to agent cerrone and two words of advice from one professional woman to another pant
its a process
paul vitti and i were involved in some organized crime activity a couple of years ago
i mean i wasnt involved not involved involved i was just trying to help him therapeutically and some people tried to uh kill us
no big deal
well shortly after you spoke he
seemed to have some kind of breakdown
what kind of breakdown
i think youd better go up there and see for yourself
vitti huddles in the corner of a bare white padded cell rocking completely out of his head
singing i feel pretty oh so pretty i feel pretty and witty and bright
ben watches through a two way mirror with the prison psychiatrist dr
they can hear vitti through a wall mounted speaker
im treating him with thioridazine milligrams t
that seems to keep him pretty calm
watching vitti that would keep a parade pretty calm
he just keeps singing west side story songs
tonight maria the balcony scene
the balcony scene
get him to do officer krupke
its really good
ben and dr
vitti doesnt seem to notice
singing whos the pretty girl in the mirror
who can that attractive girl be
paul its me
with a look to dr
cutler oh boy
to vitti whats going on maria
the rumble its tonight
i have to get out of here
i dont want to die
no chino no
vittis jaw suddenly goes slack and he slumps in his seat staring forward
ben waves a hand in front of vittis face
this is how its been
he sings for a while then he goes completely catatonic
can we take him to an examining room
vitti sits inert on the examination table
you already did a neurological work up
no tumors no aneurisms no sign of stroke
ben slaps vittis face lightly a couple times
completely catatonic he pulls on vittis ears and nose
vitti does not react
well i dont think hes smart enough to be faking
street smart yes but were talking about an i
just north of a bedroom slipper
ben checks vitti out of the corner of his eye
then ben takes a sharp needle from an instrument tray
so if i just stuck him with this needle he probably wouldnt even respond
i dont know
ben hesitates for a moment to see if vitti will crack then okay he sticks the needle into vittis shoulder
bursts into song boy boy crazy boy keep cool boy
got a rocket in your pocket keep cool y cool boy vitti is sitting at a table facing ben
cutler observes from a chair in the corner
paul were going to give you some tests to assess your mental condition
theres no pressure just answer as best you can
do i have your consent to share the results of these tests
mommys mad at me because i made a boom on the rug
ill take that as a yes
okay im going to show you ten cards each containing a picture of an inkblot
i want you to look at each card and tell me what you see
i see you
i see him
i see a table
you havent seen the card yet
hands him first card what does this look like to you
take your time
vitti looks at the wrong side of the card
its all white
it looks like snow
no paul the other side
vitti turns it over and makes a face
a big bat
or a weasel
taking notes bat or weasel
and hes got a little girl no its a little boy in his teeth and hes shakin him and shakin him cause the kid didnt wipe himself good and the
kid is screaming because the bat weasel ripped out his throat and the blood is shootin out of his neck vein
pointing thats the blood
doctor cutler looks worried
skeptical see anything else
just the pussy with the teeth
making more notes pussy with teeth
vitti is literally trying to pound a square peg into a round hole
now try repeating the numbers backwards
for instance if i was you will say
vitti studies a vague and ambiguous photograph of a man standing beside a bed with a sleeping woman and child on it
just tell me what you think is going on in this picture
this is a picture of a guy nice hardworking guy comes home and finds out his wifes been screwin this midget while he was out of town
appalled makes a note screwing a midget
and how does the story end
i think he works over the midget for a while then he blows em away
the wife or the midget
smirks trick question right
both of em
in this one im going to start a sentence and you complete it any way you want to
i get angry yes
no youre supposed to complete the sentence
i said yes
i wasnt asking if you agreed or disagreed it was more like i get angry when whenever
well that about does it for me
ben meets with richard chapin the u
attorney for the southern district of new york
based on his symptoms and the test results id say brief psychotic disorder if it persists possibly schizophreniform disorder
cutler agrees with my diagnosis
so hes crazy
no hes annoying but vitti
at least not permanently
in certain people continuous exposure to an extremely stressful situation soldiers in combat for instance disaster victims a hostage situation or being locked up in a maximum security prison with
someone trying to kill you it can produce a temporary psychotic state
a day a week up to a month if the precipitating stressors are removed
musing which means hes not going to get any better while hes still in the can
he could get worse
he could deteriorate to the point where hed be permanently schizophrenic
then id say hes got a real problem because he goes before the parole board in four weeks
you think theyll let him out
oh yeah im sure theyll want to release a major mafia figure whos now totally deranged on top of it
thinks well couldnt you release him to a halfway house or some place where he could get some decent treatment
based on my earlier work with him i dont think hes dangerous and i think he was making a real effort to reform himself
you do huh
thinks for a long moment okay
then ill tell you what
im gonna release him into your custody
no this is a bad time for me
my father just died and ive got this bulging disc in my neck and were redecorating which is a total nightmare
i cant you want to see him killed in prison
no of course not
or sent to a facility for the criminally insane
no then hes all yours
im going to talk to the bureau of prisons and get you certified as a temporary federal institution
i cant be an institution
firm youve got thirty days to get him in shape for his parole hearing
that means sane sober and gainfully employed
but let me warn you doctor
if he fucks up in any way if he flees or if i find out that this whole thing was just a setup so he could get back on the
street and return to a life of crime i will hold you totally responsible and ill see that you are stripped of your license and prosecuted to the full extent of the law
are we clear
you still want him
long beat to decide yes
the gate opens and ben coaxes vitti outside
a guard watches them
okay paul this way
vitti comes out carrying an overnight bag walking like a zombie
ben leads him over to the car and opens the door for him
vitti keeps walking passing the car
this way paul
here we go
ben helps vitti into the car
one of vittis legs is still outside
ben lifts vittis leg into the car and closes the door
ben starts the car and pulls away with vitti still slumped in his seat
once out of sight of the prison vitti straightens and turns on ben suddenly lucid
enraged you fucking son of a bitch
where the fuck do you get off sticking me with a needle
i knew it
i knew you were faking
you used me to get you out of prison
took you long enough
i was singin west side story for three fuckin days
im half a fag already
what are you talking about
i call you to say somebodys trying to kill me and you hang up on me
i was at the funeral home
youre my fuckin doctor
my father died
me me me me
get over it
are you hearing yourself
perfunctorily im deeply sorry for your loss
yeah i can see how touched you are
whats the difference
you hated him anyway
i loved my father
im feeling a lot of grief right now
im not sensing it but if you say so
ben nervously pops a pill and swallows it
re pill whats that
im getting over a cold
all right whats going on
whos after you
i dont know take your pick
could be my old family or could be the rigazzis
ever heard of lou rigazzi lou the wrench
why the wrench
because he twisted a guys head off once
fuckin calabrese animals
and comin from me you know thats a big compliment
im sure theyd be flattered
so the feds are really putting the pressure on
the families are fighting each other again whats left of em
its the fall of the fuckin roman empire
its world war three out there
so what does that have to do with you
they knew i was gettin out soon and the last thing anybody wants to see is me getting into it on either side
maybe if you just explain to them that youre out of it now that youre starting a new life yeah theyll probably want to throw me a party and give
me a gold watch
trust me nobodys lookin forward to me being out
you are arent you
oh yeah my future looks real fuckin rosy
ben cant believe what hes gotten himself into
ben and vitti pull into the driveway and get out of the car
want to grab your stuff
im not gonna be here that long
jellys pickin me up in an hour
i dont think you understand
youre in my custody
i could get in a lot of trouble if you screw up
dont worry about it
ill call you tomorrow
you want to go back to sing sing
thursdays meatloaf night
i can have you back there in no time
attorney was very clear
you stay with me therapy every day you cant leave the area without permission what are you my father now
and you have to get a job as soon as youre well enough which is now
so are you coming in with me or do i have to make a phone call
vitti relents and grabs his stuff from the back seat
some fuckin life this is gonna be
he follows ben up the stairs
chapin is conferring with another u
attorney davis and agents miller and cerrone
you really think vitti is crazy
yeah hes about as crazy as i am
think about it
locked up he was absolutely no use to me
but back on the street vittis still powerful enough to pose a threat to both families
its like throwing gasoline on a fire
if we can use vitti to escalate this war we might just end up putting them all away
thats if he goes back to his old life
people like paul vitti dont change
this guys been a menace to society since he was twelve years old
being a criminal is all he knows
hes gonna head straight for trouble
then all we have to do is sit back and pick up the pieces
we could get twenty maybe even thirty indictments next time the grand jury convenes
smiles you know giuliani started this way
you running for mayor
just stick with vitti
ben and laura are in the kitchen cleaning up the dinner dishes
ben is wearing an apron that says to heck with housework
and a pair of playtex rubber gloves
laura is angrily muscling dishes around
how could you
how could you bring him here
that shuddering mobster in my home eating off my dishes
looking at the plate in her hand disgusted ewww
she scrubs the plate with manic energy
i didnt have a lot of choice
oh theres a law that says you have to bring a gangster home
i told you
hes in my custody
im a federal institution
you should be in an institution
why couldnt he just go home
his wife and kids arent here
theyre in ohio
everyone gets to be in ohio except me
his life was threatened and he didnt want to endanger his family
what about endangering our family
worried i think my teeth are loose
feel my teeth
honey your teeth are fine
i know its an imposition but what could i do
i didnt want him here
they you didnt want him i didnt want him but here he is
she looks up and jumps when she sees vitti standing there
covering cheerful here he is
somebody said something about coffee
that was you
you said you wanted some
so whats the holdup
to ben why dont you make your friend some coffee
im going upstairs to take a long bath and hopefully drown
laura smiles at the two men then exits
youll have to forgive her
shes usually a great hostess
the whole situations a little awkward with me bein here but lets face it emily fuckin post shes not
emily fuckin post
well that explains why she rarely used her middle name
listen i got a friend coming over
i didnt want you to be surprised
what kind of friend
because if its the wrench or the power drill or any other kind of tool not that kind of friend
its a personal thing
they wont stay late will they
stares at him are you really that pussy whipped
im not this has nothing to do with laura
i heard her busting your balls
we were having a disagreement
a certain amount of conflict is normal in a marriage
or youre pussy whipped
paul good night whippy
calls after him remember this is only temporary
i didnt hear you the tenth fuckin time
ben knocks on michaels door and walks in without waiting to be asked
michael is sitting up in bed reading
oblivious mike can we talk for a second
i know the last few weeks have been kind of tough with grandpa dying and everything and it mightve felt to you like i didnt have time for you or
i didnt care about how you feel
no it didnt
because i want you to know that you can talk to me about stuff and that i can really listen and understand what youre going through
i do dad
and if i seemed a little hard on grandpa its just that your grandfather was a hard man in a lot of ways
he wanted everything done his way and sometimes i just felt like nothing i ever did was good enough
i dont want it to be that way with us
and you know at times like this we all might start questioning our own mortality and you might be thinking how devastated youd be if i died
and i realize its all a little hectic right now but this paul vitti thing is only temporary okay
i didnt hear you the tenth fuckin time
thats not funny
good night michael
good night whippy
ben exits shaking his head
the moment hes gone the rumpled blankets next to michael shift and a cute punky year old girl emerges from hiding under the comforter
i gotta get home
what was that about
i have no idea
the suburban street is dark and quiet and all the lights are off in the house
the room is dark
we pan up the foot of ben and lauras bed and find them both wide awake staring straight up at the ceiling listening
oh oh oh oh
this has to be some kind of record dont you think
its been like forty minutes
how long are you going to let them go on
how much longer can he go
another twenty minutes im either breaking it up or calling the guinness book of records
the moaning shifts into low gear more guttural and bestial
oh give me a break
shes got to be
nobody sounds like that
suggestively thats not entirely true
okay sometimes you do sound like that
moaning kicks up another notch
laura rolls over and jams her pillow over her ears
ben growls exasperated
michaels girlfriend is gone
he has his bedroom door open a crack and hes standing there holding a small tape recorder and smiling broadly
high pitched now ah ah ah ah
agents cerrone and miller sit in a sedan with a small sophisticated looking microphone trained on the sobel house just down the street
they hear the high pitched moaning
miller gives cerrone a look
oh come on
nobody sounds like that
ben takes a deep breath and knocks sharply on the guest room door
the heavy moaning stops
after a moment vitti appears wearing only a bathrobe
ben can see the beautiful sheila sitting naked on the bed
indignant i have a year old son
so let him get his own fuckin girl
can i talk to you please
actually im right in the middle of someone
sheila starts to light a cigarette
theres no smoking in this house
michael freezes about to light a cigarette himself
ben comes down the stairs with vitti
what do you think youre doing
minding my own fuckin business like you should be doin
well its a little hard with the live sex show going on in the guest room
ive been in prison for two and a half years
what am i supposed to do
go to a hotel
thats what i wanted to do but you told me i had no choice it was either here or sing sing
im not trying to punish you
these arent my rules but i have a responsibility here
besides i thought you might like a nice home cooked meal after being in prison that long
yeah thats what ive been jerkin off about for eight hundred consecutive nights a nice home cooked meal
making a jerking motion ohhhh tuna casserole
that girl is not staying here
i think youre jealous
oh yeah im really jealous
i didnt hear nothin comin out of your room
we dont think its necessary to wake the neighbors every time we have sex
hey if youre really quiet you might be able to do it without even wakin up your wife
ben looks curiously at vitti
i told her if i wasnt back in two minutes to start without me
i gotta go
vitti heads back upstairs
this is not a good start paul
laura and ben are hosting a brunch for the out of town relatives
laura offers a basket of bagels to a seated older woman
aunt ester im so sorry we had to put you up at the hotel
we wanted you here with us but we had an unexpected house guest
she glares at ben
sighs your father always had room for us
mutters to laura next time i lose a parent ill be sure to reserve the guest room
a door slams somewhere then sheila storms into the room sobbing her hair askew tucking her blouse into her skirt
screaming go to hell paul
you just go to hell
get out of here you crazy fuckin whore
vitti charges into the room his robe open
from the reactions of everyone in the room its clear hes not wearing anything under it
go back to turning tricks in jersey for all i fuckin care
sheila exits and slams the front door
vitti sees everyone staring at him
he closes his robe
hows it goin
sees buffet oh we got food
vitti heads for the buffet
vitti bellies up to the buffet stepping between an older couple
he eyes the food disdainfully
who do you have to fuck to get some bacon around here
the woman reacts in horror
not you im guessing
snags vittis arm why dont we go to my office
ill make you a plate
ben and vitti enter
vitti still in his robe
what is it with your relatives
they tend to overreact quite a bit
all you did was flash everybody in the dining room
from the look of em some of those broads havent seen the old salcicc in a long time
its good for them
well when the paramedics revive my aunt goldie ill be sure to ask her
vitti starts for bens chair
ah ah ah
he points vitti to the sofa and takes his own chair
so what are you going to do paul
what do you mean
with your life
first im gonna find out whos tryin to kill me
im a target
somebody could shoot right through that window blow my fuckin head off
ben sees that hes in the line of fire gets up and moves out of the way
okay thats a priority
have you thought about what youre going to do for work
im too big for a jockey so i was thinkin maybe a hairdresser
theyll call me mr
there must be something you like to do
i like hitting a guy on the head with a baseball bat
oh sporting goods

shrugs im the boss
the boss of what jelly
youre not the boss of me
so what are you the boss of
you youre good
i see what youre doing here
what am i doing paul
youre pissing me off is what youre doing
look at me
its starting again the anxiety
youve spent your whole life becoming who you are and now you cant be that anymore thats gotta be scary
if youre not paul vitti the mob boss who are you
vitti is at a loss
well lets think
when you were a kid what did you want to be
i dont know
who remembers that stuff
you mustve wanted to be something when you were little fireman
what did you want to be
were not talking about me
i wanted to be a philatelist
you wanted to look up peoples assholes all day
no paul i believe youre thinking of a proctologist
i wanted to collect rare and unusual stamps
you mustve been a lot of laughs when you were a kid
so what did you want to be
you afraid to tell me
yeah im afraid
then tell me
im not here to judge you
a beat okay
when i was really little like seven or eight maybe i wanted to be a cowboy
my father gave me a cowboy suit you know the vest the chaps the cap guns the whole thing
and he used to take me up to my uncles farm in new jersey and lead me around on this pony
yippee i o
you happy now
so you watched cowboy movies and tv shows with your father
the whole family
my father loved gunsmoke
corrects him marshal dillon
so who were your favorite cowboys
this is so fuckin retarded
gene autry roy rogers the lone ranger interesting
theyre all good guys
yeah i guess
no thats important
you didnt want to be the bad guy
you wanted to be the hero
so what happened
i dont know
so why didnt you become a cowboy
i lived in east harlem
i joined a street gang when i was and that was it
something else happened when you were twelve
prompting something that made you very sad
the dodgers moved from brooklyn to l
everybody took it pretty hard
we playin a guessing game here
your father was murdered
right in front of you
do i remember
i think about it every fuckin day of my life
whats that got to do with it
its got everything to do with it
he gave you the cowboy suit
with a white hat
he was in the mob but he wanted you to be a good guy didnt he
vitti starts thinking about his father and starts to weep
he didnt want you in the gang life
he only did it himself so you wouldnt have to
he was trying to buy you a better life than his
crying harder he always said he wanted me to go to college
i didnt even finish high school
he really starts sobbing now
well paul this could be a great opportunity for you
youre right back where you were when you were twelve
youve got some big choices to make
vitti fights to regain control
thats enough of that shit
its not shit paul
my point is when youre a child you think anything is possible
wouldnt it be great to think like that now
retreating back into his cynicism yeah just sprinkle some fuckin fairy dust on me
im just saying youve got to keep an open mind and explore some new possibilities
try some different things maybe youll connect with one of them
theres a career counselor i work with
i can call him for you
he may be able to help you find a job
you mean working for somebody
im supposed to take orders from some guy who used to get me coffee
starts sweating and
breathing hard i cant do that
its not right
its not me
how do you know unless you try
suddenly one of the windows behind vitti shatters
ben dives for cover
silence then another rap on the window
ben looks out and sees jelly in the back yard tossing stones at the window
calls out hiya doc
sorry about the window
ben waves him around to the side door
jelly is loading up a plate of food from the buffet talking to the elderly relatives
laura stares at him
i love lox and bagels
i dated a jewish woman once
actually she might have been the love of my life but my mother broke it up
she was always hockin me a chinick about the madels
a wonderful woman my mother but she fuckin hates the hebes
noting mountain of food on his plate more smoked salmon

gunshot wound to the head

vitti puts the window up
shouts anxiously if you screw this up paul paul
the car pulls away

ben turns and sees his aunt goldie on the porch

soldiers lounge at the bar keeping a respectful distance from the capos seated at a table in the rear
all eyes turn as the door opens and vitti enters
sal masiello vittis old consigliere rises and warmly but warily welcomes vitti back into the fold

vitti embraces him and they sit down with the others

vitti gives his old friend a pat on the back and exits
jelly pulls up vitti gets out and strides up to the front door of a nice home on staten island and rings the bell
the door is opened by eddie devol early thirties dark and sullen
thats how you answer the door
you got a problem with that
vitti punches eddie in the mouth sending him sprawling back into the living room
several other bodyguards are watching television caught off guard by vittis sudden entrance
where is she
calls out in the kitchen paul
patty lopresti mid forties still sexy even in an apron is mixing cake batter in a bowl with an electric mixer
paul what a nice surprise

patty hugs and kisses him taking the opportunity to pat him down for a weapon or a hidden wire
sorry to hear about carmine
he was a good man
you live with a person twenty one years then one day theyre
pulling his torso out of the river
ill bet especially with all the talk about you being the one who put him there
thats why i try not to gossip paul
just a sec
screaming to ceiling michelle
its ten thirty
stop fucking around and get ready for ballet
to vitti its hard being a single parent and a career woman

the pressure its awful
for instance a lot of people think now that youre out youre going to try and take the family back from me
but i said no paul would never do that
smiling by the way how are marie and the kids

in shaker heights
vitti explodes reaches across the counter and grabs her by the shoulders
enraged you even go near them you crazy bitch quietly dont make me call my guys in

vitti lets her go
smoothing clothes flushed and a little excited wow

nobodys got nothin to worry about from me
he heads for the door
calls after him dont be a stranger
after vitti leaves eddie enters from the other door
turning to eddie watch him like a hawk
if he steps out of line it would break my heart but shoot him in the fuckin head
vitti is trying to sell an audi to the macinernys an upscale middle aged couple
vitti opens the trunk
look at the size of that trunk
you could fit three people in there
off their shocked looks not people suitcases
its a joke
the macinernys laugh uncertainly
so what are you driving now
macinerny we have a lexus
nods its a fancy toyota right
the japs make good cars but i aint that quick to forget pearl harbor
the macinernys look doubtful
a crowd of well heeled new yorkers surround vitti at the captains station
vitti the new host greets a prominent sports figure who embraces him like an old friend
signals the maitre d mario put mr
torre at table five
joey boots an old acquaintance of vittis enters with a couple of his cronies
paul i heard you were out
all dressed up for dinner huh
the maitre d crosses away and waves at vitti
paul that table for six is ready
you can send them back

dying nah not really
its like im on parole so i just i come in i greet people
joey and his friends nod condescendingly
i get it
nice seein you paul

joey and his guys walk away they turn back and glance at vitti then whisper something in audible to each other and laugh
vitti burns humiliated
vitti poses for a picture with some notables
vitti with some broadway actors
vitti poses grimly with a businessman and his friends
vitti moves to leave
hey could you get us a big bottle of pellegrino and another round of drinks
he slips vitti a couple of bills
vitti stares at the money in his hand
and more bread when you get a chance
you want more bread
he takes a small loaf from the breadbasket on the next table stuffs it into the businessmans mouth and walks off
ill get your drinks now
two hassidim are in the back of a th street jewelry store sorting through a huge pile of diamonds
behind the display counter vitti stares at the diamonds breathing hard starting to perspire
his customers a thirty ish young man and his fiancee study the diamond engagement ring on her finger
this stone is supposed to be a g color but it looks kind of yellow doesnt it
distracted fluorescent light
makes everything look yellow
he starts instinctively casing the store
i thought fluorescent light makes everything look blue
bound and gagged
sweating what am i edison
im telling you its a g
he glances at the surveillance cameras
can i look at it with a lens
the camera lens and clipping the alarm wires
completely distracted what

in the back as it blows up
bens cousin approaches vitti who is now hyperventilating
are you all right
im gonna do us both a big favor
the macinernys are trembling
you want to see the manager
grabs his crotch heres the manager
now take a hike you fuckin deadbeats
the macinernys rush out of the showroom
calls after them get a hyundai
vitti is on the sofa
hes wearing a shiny silk short sleeved shirt with the sleeves turned up tight black chino pants and short black pointy toed boots
his hair is oiled and coifed like early frankie avalon
distraught i cant deal with this shit
my grades suck im gettin in fights every day and if i get suspended again my mothers gonna fuckin kill me if the nuns dont kill me first
is listening to vitti but dressed as sigmund freud
nodding eins zwei drei
vittis mother is sitting next to him
elbows him sit up straight
pay attention when the doctor talks to you
this is costing money
ben freud has a large taxi meter ticking away beside him
what are you doin here
snorts some cocaine acht gemacht gehunden nicht
i tell him the same thing
suddenly the windows are shattered by gunfire
blasts open flying off the hinges
jelly enters pushed into the room by a gang of thugs led by patty lopresti eddie devol and his guys all at least ten feet tall and all holding huge
leaps to his feet and reaches for his gun but instead pulls out a long sword
confused but desperate he holds up the sword to menace the intruders but the sword suddenly goes limp
he tries to make the blade stand up but it just keeps dropping like a piece of soft rope
patty eddie and the thugs laugh contemptuously at vitti while jelly looks on with an incredible stream of tears pouring from his eyes
vitti is back in bed in his robe still asleep
the door opens and laura enters with an interior decorator who has fabric samples over her arm
now in here i thought wed get rid of the wallpaper and maybe put in some wainscoting she sees vitti and quickly steers the decorator back outside
to decorator dont look dont look
she comes back in closes the bedroom door and confronts vitti who is still groggy from his troubling dream
do you realize its almost noon
do me a favor honey make me a sandwich
you want a sandwich
make it yourself
im not afraid of you mr
oh im a great big mobster man
i want you out of my house
ive had it with the bathrobe and the skulking around and the girlfriend who im sorry is so obviously faking its not even funny

im going to be honest with you im a very anxious person hey
we have so much in common
anyway this is not helping me its not helping my marriage and i know ben really needs some alone time
so im asking you as a human being could you please leave
off vittis look yes ill make you a sandwich
ham cheese lettuce tomato mayonnaise no onion
jelly comes out the front door with vittis suitcases as ben pulls into the driveway
he gets out of the car holding a small bag from the drugstore and sees vitti coming out the front door
ben stops him on the porch
concerned where are you going
where am i going
the orphanage found my real parents
they want me back
to jelly put those in the car
to ben im goin to jellys
jelly carries the luggage to his car parked in the driveway
to vitti the hell you are
youre supposed to be in my custody
we have therapy today
the more we talk the worse i get
i had that dream again
the one where youre mussolini
no the other one
the limp sword dream
at car i probably shouldnt be listening to this
to vitti do you think this dream might be sexual
i know what youre thinkin
the sword is my cock and i cant get it up but that aint it
i saw sheila last night and i had a hard on you could swing from
winces i dont want to know that
you coulda hung wet towels on it
calls out hes like a racehorse in that area
i get it
to jelly wait in the car
to ben so what does it mean
ben sits on the wicker divan
sex can represent a lot of things
in your case i think its about performance anxiety
trying to find a job that fits
doc nothings gonna fit
that nine to five bullshit ill fuckin kill myself if i have to do that for the rest of my life
you know they take taxes out of your check
what the fuck is that
im gonna end up selling hot dogs on the street
starts breathing hard and sweating look at me
im havin a fuckin panic attack here
my hearts beatin like a rabbit
he empties the drugstore bag and hands it to vitti
breathe into this
vitti sits on a wicker chair
speaks through bag this is your fault
tellin me i have to get a job like im some fuckin nobody
it was humiliating
thanks a lot
jumps up in a total rage hey im doing the best i can
if you cant appreciate that or if my best isnt good enough for you then maybe you should find somebody else to talk to you selfish prick
ben breaks down and cries what amounts to one racking sob then quickly pulls himself together
what the hell was that
its a process
ben takes a pill bottle out of his pocket and pops a couple of pills
now what are you takin
echinacea and goldenseal
do you know the tv show little caesar
yeah i know it
the producer of that show is a man
named raoul berman
a mutual friend told him i knew you and mr
berman called me this morning
he wants to meet you
meet him and find out
ben and laura walk up to a trendy japanese restaurant in chelsea
ben is really keyed up
we finally got him out of the house why are we having dinner with him
i mean how professional is that
this is not social
pauls meeting a television producer who might have a job for him
hes nervous and wants me here as a buffer
im a buffer thats all
hes a grown man
i dont see why he needs a chaperone
he needs a buffer
im here in buffer capacity only
ben if you say buffer one more time ben pops a couple of pills
didnt you just take two of those
no that was something else
well you better not drink anything
you know what happens
im a doctor
i think i know what im doing
ben opens the door and motions for laura to enter
quietly behind her back buffer
cerrone and miller watch the front of the restaurant
into radio theyre all inside
were going to get something to eat
well be back before they finish dinner
they drive off
seated at a table are ben and laura vitti and sheila jelly and the producer raoul berman and his uptight downtown girlfriend
jelly inspects a piece of raw octopus while raoul gushes over a platter of sushi and sashimi
i adore this place
best sushi in town
have you tried the yellowtail paul
raoul picks up a floppy piece of raw fish with his chopsticks
makes a face no
we gettin any real food
this is like eatin fuckin bait
raoul chuckles and glances uncomfortably at his girlfriend
ben laughs loudly to cover the awkward moment
hes suffering from some reaction between the pills and the booze and hes oddly thick lipped
honey did you hear what paul just said
he said this is like eating bait
not amused i heard him
and i think it was effing bait
why you talkin like that
like a fuckin retard
pointing to his lower lip oh this
i took a couple ibuprofen before we got here i shouldnt have had the saki
ill be fine
it only lasts a couple hours
to raoul rah oo
i guess you need both lips for that name
you know what i love about paul
he was born without a filter
he says exactly what hes thinking just lays it right out there
he doesnt edit himself
quietly you wanna shut the fuck up
he just told me to shut the fuck up
i love that
to raoul isnt he great
aside to ben too much buffering
way too much
eyeing ben oddly yes
paul im such a huge fan of yours not a fan but you know an admirer
dont admire me too much
is there any chance you might be interested in working on little caesar as a consultant
give us technical advice coach the actors make sure the dialogue rings true
that would be incredible
did you hear that paul
raoul wants to know if youd be interested in working on his show as a consultant
you know give technical advice coach the actors quietly to ben in two seconds im gonna put a fork in your eye
suddenly cowed got it
so what do you think paul
yeah sure whatever
this is so exciting
berman i love your show
anthony bella the guy who plays nicky caesar i think he grew up in bensonhurst next door to my cousins friends husband
thats her claim to fame
to sheila i hate to bust your bubble but hes not from bensonhurst
hes a professional italian
he grew up in connecticut or something like that
well wherever hes from i think hes a wonderful actor
yeah i bet he gets a lot of pussy
laura chokes on her drink
whats the matter with you
we got women at the table
you said fuckin
hey speaking of colorful this peacock walks into a bar oh my god
to a passing waiter rising her half empty drink could i get another one please
and one for me
no more for the buffer
she glares at ben as the table descends into silence
tries a desperate save so
i see in the paper where oklahoma
might win the tony award
vittis eyes suddenly go wide
he grabs sheila and pulls her down as gunfire rakes the wall behind them
everybody else at the table hits the floor
other diners scream in terror
jelly pulls a gun and shoots back
runs from the restaurant
after a long beat the frightened patrons start to get up and chatter nervously
vitti helps sheila to her feet
to vitti what the hell was that
i think somebodys got it in for raoul
raoul crawls up from behind the table
wide eyed holy fucking shit
grinning that was phenomenal
jelly stands in front of an apartment building parking garage
a guy comes walking up the ramp toward him
as he comes nearer we see that the guy is the gunman from the restaurant
hey pal got a light
the guy stops pulls out a zippo and lights it for jelly
wheres your cigarette
im trying to cut down
the gunman recognizes jelly and desperately reaches for the gun in his pocket but jelly hauls off and whacks the guy across the back of the head with a sap
as he slumps into jellys arms vitti steps out of a doorway and jelly drags the gunman into the garage
ben and laura are getting ready for bed
i dont know why you feel you have to save this man
its my job
he needs me
so that automatically means you have to help him
youre always doing this putting other peoples needs ahead of your own like youre this martyr or saint or something
its like living with mother teresa
actually i hear she was tough to live with
lot of parties loud music lepers
you dont need this in your life especially not now
you really need to be grieving for your father
i havent seen it
well you know its a process
i mean we had issues theres some anger but ill work it out
laura goes to ben and embraces him
its okay honey
you can let it go
ben almost starts to break but he holds it back
no im its okay
ben sits heavily on the bed
its just a confusing time
i became a therapist because he was a therapist so obviously his approval was very important to me
but is that the only reason i did it
i dont know
and now that hes gone why do i keep doing it
is this what i really want
she sits next to him and takes his hand
i just want you to be happy
she kisses him
maybe youre right
kisses her maybe its time i started focusing on me and you know satisfying some of
he looks at her expectantly
apologetic oh honey i just brushed my teeth
no thats not what i meant
i just need at a loss i dont know what
she puts her arms around him and holds him
vitti and jelly stand with the gunman on the roof of the parking garage four stories above the ground
the guys arms are bound
jelly ties a rope around his ankles
im gonna ask you once nicely
who you working for
jelly shoves the guy to the parapet at the edge of the roof grabs him by the legs and hangs him over the side of the building
the guy screams
ill ask you again
who you working for
the guy keeps screaming
hes screamin too loud
hold on a second
jelly swings the guy against the building hitting his head and dazing him momentarily
who are you working for
drop him jelly
im working for rigazzi
pull him back up
jelly drops the guy
the gunman plunges three stories and lands heavily in a dumpster full of garbage
whats the matter with you
you said drop him
i said pull him back up
thats not what i heard
you heard what you wanted to hear
okay you got me there
a family business in jersey
the light from outside barely penetrates the painted windows of the shabby office
lou rigazzi aka lou the wrench the aging boss of the rigazzi family sits in the half light as a couple of his soldiers enter with the battered and hobbling
gunman between them
what the hell happened to you
vitti threw me off a roof
you talked to vitti
what did you say to him
i didnt tell him anything
rigazzi can i go i think my legs broken
that must hurt
rigazzi pulls out a gun with a silencer and shoots the gunman
i hate to see people in pain
to soldiers get him out of here
what about vitti
musing hes a hard man to kill
but hes not immortal
our time will come
a big family barbecue is going on in a back yard in queens
several children are splashing in an over sized above ground swimming pool
oddly the children appear to be shouting and laughing but make no sound
at the barbecue nicky caesar is watching his friend mello turn italian sausage on the grill
i like mine burnt
i dont know how you like your sausage
twenty fuckin years we been doin this
so you got the money
the wind shifts and blows the smoke from the barbecue in their faces
coughing eyes watering not all of it
im still light about fifteen large
blinded by smoke can we cut
this is ridiculous
can you do something about the fucking smoke
we pull back to reveal the set of little caesar
assistant directors and production assistants echo the director were cut
vitti observes the action sitting in a directors chair still brooding over the previous nights events
raoul sits next to him
to vitti this is the problem with shooting on location
but its worth it for the authenticity
yeah this is real authentic
calls out tony
come here a second
to vitti anthony bella
he plays nicky caesar
i know who he is
they used to watch the show up at sing sing
delighted are you shitting me
anthony bella joins them
tony this is paul vitti

raoul laughs hard
you laugh too much
so paul you going to join us
vitti looks around his future plans now beginning to form
you got a good setup here

vitti turns to raoul
coupla things though
i dont know who makes these decisions but some of this it dont look right
concerned i sensed it myself
which elements strike you as wrong
the people mainly
i mean you got a boss who speaks australian
what the fuck is that
and im guessing your
background is what
the theater mostly
yeah the theater
so how about if i bring in some guys that i know you know more authentic
i would be eternally grateful
one of those trailers like the stars have
slight hesitation done
shakes his hand ill put that in the works right now
he hurries off to talk to his assistant
jelly comes up to vitti
you really gonna do this
no fuckin way
ive had it with this job bullshit
a week of this and id either shoot myself or shoot raoul
but its good cover while i figure out my next move
call the guys
you got it
jelly and vittis old crew mo mo bigs tuna eddie cokes and eight or nine other wiseguys walk en masse into base camp
vittis guys go to the front of the lunch line forcing the crew aside
a big pop out trailer labeled mr
vitti guarded by three of his guys
tuna brings a lunch tray and knocks on the door
jelly opens the door and takes the tray
vitti conferring with raoul and tony bella on the script
ripping out whole sections
vitti in the makeup trailer getting a haircut and manicure while he smokes a cigar and talks on his cell phone
vitti with the costumer approving and nixing various wardrobe choices while jelly steals an expensive watch in the b
vitti in a massage chair getting a backrub from a masseuse
a production assistant approaches him
theyre ready to start shooting mr
yeah ten minutes tell em
eddie devol patty loprestis guy watches vitti from a safe distance
ben comes out of the market carrying several grocery bags and a small prescription bag
two mafia soldiers step up beside him and urge him toward a big stretch limo idling at the curb
walk this way
there must be some mistake
i didnt order a limo
get in the car
ben enters timorously still carrying his groceries
patty lopresti masiello and a couple of other heavyweights are sitting at the table all except patti smoking cigars
ben immediately recognizes their status and grasps the gravity of their mood
nervous but trying to keep it light hello
im ben sobel
and you are
the soldier sits ben down
the other soldier takes his groceries
ben looks at patty trying to gauge her role
youre the shrink whos taking care of paul vitti
to guy with groceries could you be careful because i think they put the eggs on the bottom
he drops the bags heavily onto the bar
is he nuts or what
is he nuts
i cant discuss a patients case with anyone discuss it
id say hes still suffering from chronic anxiety and he hesitates
we call it antisocial personality disorder
very carefully meaning he fails to conform to societal norms with respect to lawful behavior
im getting a fuckin headache here
what are you saying
hes got a criminal temperament
stares at him hes a criminal
this is news
and for that you need a doctor degree
so what are you doin with him
well im trying to at least show him the possibility of change wrong
you do not want him to change
ben looks at her sensing her command of the group
we havent really been introduced this is mrs
ben offers his hand but she ignores it
ben paul vitti is important to this family
we dont want to see you turn him into a stromboni
that thing they clean the ice with at hockey games
thats a zamboni asshole
its a bull with his balls cut off
she reaches under the table and grabs bens balls
he winces in pain
squeezed no we dont want to do that
not unless you want to be one too
in pain me
im very attached to my balls
as you can probably tell
lets go then do the right thing understand
greatly relieved yes i understand completely
may i go now
i have perishables he takes his groceries and edges away
vitti is sitting at a table with jelly and some of his main guys
from a distance it looks like theyre playing cards
up close its a different story
were gonna need a grapple or a crane with maybe a fifty foot boom
i seen one in bayonne but ill call around
see what you can come up with
and were gonna need a city bus
i got a guy in the transit authority
he owes me
just let me know when
vitti turns to see patty eddie devol and his men heading across the set
i guess everybodys gone hollywood huh
how you doin patty
jelly youre working here too
im an extra
an extra what
it aint bad
you just stand around all day waitin for them to shoot and they pay you eighty bucks
for standin around all day
you used to sneeze eighty bucks
how much you make shootin craps
about eight hundred maybe
and how about bookin bets for the teamsters and the crew
one of the producers really likes the ponies
so eighteen hundred bucks
plus eighty i know extra
they all laugh
an assistant director approaches the group
this is a closed set
were about to start shooting
so am i
eddie grabs the assistant director and walks him away
the trucks and trailers are arranged on a parking lot
a car pulls up and lou rigazzi gets out with his bodyguards
should i wait here mr
no pull the car up your ass and wait there
patty takes vittis arm and walks with him
i heard you had some more trouble
one of rigazzis guys took a shot at me
she stops at the extras makeup table and starts primping in the mirror
i dont have to tell you paul
alone on the street you dont stand a chance
thats what the familys all about
since the old days when the grandfathers first came over
thats not something you just walk away from
yeah i know
when youre a jet youre a jet all the way
so you want to tell me whats going on here
it looks like you got your whole crew back together
nothings going on
dont bullshit me paul
youre planning something
im feeling very left out
something big is going down but youre getting a cut
my hand to god
youre a good friend paul
and i would never think of insisting on this but id feel better if you brought in eddie and some of my guys to help with the job
i dont think so
then ill have to insist
raoul approaches and eyes patty disdainfully
oh dear god
first of all sweetheart were not shooting the hooker scene until tomorrow
and the hair please what is that
raoul this is a friend of mine
raoul freezes recognizing the name
lopresti i am so very very raoul wheels on a production assistant who happens to be passing by
how dare you not inform me mrs
lopresti was on the set
to patty enjoy your visit with us
if theres anything i can do go fuck yourself
raoul moves away quickly
patty turns back to vitti
its good to have you back paul
kisses vitti on the cheek well be in touch
as patty and her men walk away down one aisle of trucks and campers rigazzi and his men walk down the next aisle heading for the set
they narrowly miss seeing each other
ben arrives looking for vitti
he sees patty approaching and freezes then quickly ducks behind a nearby truck shielding his crotch
patty and her men pass by
ben waits until they pass then comes out of hiding and hurries on
a mildly distraught raoul is huddled with vitti
i mean tell me was she angry
am i in any danger
no youre fine
but you might want to have somebody else start your car the next couple of weeks
ill have brian do it
rigazzi and his men join them
to vitti could i talk to you for a second
eyeing rigazzi oh what is this now the bus and truck tour of guys and dolls
this is lou rigazzi
a horrified whisper the wrench
taking rigazzis hand please forgive me
im on painkillers half the time i dont know what im saying
raoul kisses rigazzis hand
rigazzi yanks it away
as he exits brian
get my car
to vitti i need a couple minutes
nodding this way
vitti and rigazzi stand at the table
rigazzis soldiers are nearby
the guy who shot at you he was acting on his own
i never gave an order
is that right
and hes been taken care of
there wont be another incident
unless youre thinkin of workin for patty lopresti
then i got no beef with you
ill sleep much better
because that would not be the way to go
you want to back a winner which is gonna be me
it only makes sense
you come work for us
ill treat you right
i dont think so
a beat well so much for sleeping better
rigazzi smiles and pats vittis cheek then exits with his soldiers
ben walks in and sees vittis guys sitting around
recognizing some of the others hey

hows it going
i did a law and order last week i had a line on sex and the city im up for a recurring on nypd blue

the camera rolls
jelly and tony bella drag ben kicking and screaming to the edge of the roof and hang him over the edge
on the ground raoul and vitti look up watching the action
doubtful does that screaming sound real to you
that sounds real
ben drives pissed off
vitti chuckles to himself
its not funny
there was no safety harness or anything
they could have dropped me
hey if you didnt want to do it why didnt you say something
i know exactly what that was about
you resent the fact that youve been put in my custody so you passive aggressively arranged things to make me look like a fool
come on you were great
turning on a dime really
i was scared at first but on the second take i think i found some good stuff
i was able to texture the screaming
vitti is laughing
oh screw you paul
just screw you
he pops two pills
what are you self medicating again
and dont give that decongestant multi vitamin bullshit
dont worry about me
just worry about what youre going to say to this parole officer

for what a high school drop out reunion
im gonna say thats none of his fuckin business
its my business
i want to know

checks side view mirror you recognize that car
the one thats been following us the last mile and a half
ben jerks his head around to look and sees a black mercedes behind him
what do you mean lose em
vitti stomps his foot down on bens flooring the accelerator
bens car speeds up suddenly
the black mercedes behind him speeds up too as does a third car that has joined the chase
ben is on the edge of panic
maybe i should just pull over
it could be the f
no theyre two cars back
you gotta be a little more observant doc
ben executes a hard skidding left
the benz stays right with him
what if we just stop and get out
theyre not going to shoot us in broad daylight
broad daylights the best time
you can see better
take a right
pedestrians scatter as ben makes a sudden turn into a bank drive thru
he over steers and wipes out an atm machine sending up a cloud of bills that flutter down like confetti
follows right behind him then the bystanders run to pick up the cash blocking the drive thru forcing miller in the fbi car to stop
two police officers are parked at the curb
they hear a horn honking and turn just as bens car comes flying past them
the cops start to pull out but stop short as the benz blows
by swerving to avoid hitting them
the cops take off in hot pursuit
frantic we cant do this paul
we have to stop
this is a lease
gunfire shatters the rear window of the car
shouting back at the mercedes its a goddamn lease
looks back move over
vitti puts his left foot on the gas pedal and his left hand on the wheel
ben tries to launch himself into the backseat but is stopped by his seat belt
he releases the belt then twists and crawls over the top of the drivers seat into the back while vitti slides into the drivers seat
bens car races past an industrial area with the mercedes right on its tail
bens car bounces over some railroad tracks and sails into a warehouse complex on the river with the mercedes still only a few car lengths behind
vitti drives down the narrow lane between two big warehouses
determined hang on
its gonna get worse
vitti rockets out from between buildings and races through a parking lot toward the river with the benz on his tail
theyre right behind us
shouts at them get away
he starts whipping things out the shattered back window a tennis racket sneakers an empty macys box
is crushed under the mercedes wheels
ben picks up the only thing left the new york times
he starts leafing through it
what the fuck are you doing
i wanted to save the crossword
bent throws the paper out the window
the times hits the windshield and one double page sticks totally obscuring the drivers view
vitti throws a skidding to a stop just inches from the rivers edge
the benz with the newspaper covering the windshield sails past them and right off the embankment
it seems to hang in the air for a long time then lands with a big splash and starts to sink almost immediately
they jump out of the car and watch the mercedes disappear under the water
aghast you think theyll get out
yeah thats james bond and the sea hunt guy in there so they got a pretty good shot
they hear police sirens approaching
vitti starts walking away quickly
ben follows after him
wherere you going
i gotta take care of something
but your parole officer send my regrets
im warning you
if you leave now so long doc
vitti takes off running ducking behind the rows of parked cars
calling after him thats it
youre on your own now pal
im police cars and the fbi car screech into the parking lot and surround ben
police divers search for the sunken mercedes in the middle of the channel
on shore ben leans against a government car looking tired and distraught while chapin berates him
where is he dr
i wish i knew
well considering that hes in your custody thats not quite the answer i was looking for
hes got something big in the works
you want to tell me what you know
i dont know anything
as far as i can tell hes making a real effort to go straight
yeah thats why ive got two corpses at the bottom of the river
he reaches through the open car window into his briefcase and pulls out a file of photographs
vitti with sal masiello
vitti with patty lopresti
vitti with lou rigazzi

ive got more than enough to put him away again without these

he starts for his car

chapin walks away
vitti is hurriedly collecting his stuff talking to jelly and a few of his old gang

vitti makes his way past the trailers heading for his car
as he passes the makeup trailer the door opens and tony bella sticks his head out

vitti looks pissed
vitti watches impatiently while the makeup artist touches up tony bella
script in hand im looking for something to do when my character finds out hes being indicted

menacing hey im serious asshole

the door flies open and tony bella comes flying out of the trailer backwards hitting the pavement hard
vitti charges out of the trailer and storms away
tony wipes blood from under his nose
that was good
my character could do that
a cab pulls up to the house and ben gets out
he walks up the driveway and sees jellys car parked at the back door and a big man in a dark suit and tie wiping the windshield
the guy in the suit turns

i dropped him at the club
little darlings in queens

he kisses laura again and takes off
several limos are parked outside a family owned nightclub in queens
ben pulls up leaning way back in the drivers seat of michaels half painted modified honda civic with the ben takes out a bottle of pills
he tries to remove the child safety cap but his hands are shaking so badly he cant do it
frustrated he tries to bite the cap off then gives up and throws the bottle away
ben enters the club
a moment later cerrone and miller cruise by in an unmarked car and park at the end of the block
ben enters the nightclub and starts moving through the crowd looking for vitti
he pushes through and sees jelly and a few of the guys watching an exotic dancer a beautiful young blonde in a skimpy costume standing on a platform grinding in
yelling over music hey doc
what are you doin here
jelly tucks a few bills into her g string
she looks at ben and winks suggestively
i think she likes you doc
give her a couple of bucks
ben reluctantly digs in his pocket and holds out a bill to the stripper
can you break a twenty
the stripper sensuously fingers the top of her g string and ben gingerly sticks the twenty in it
do i just make my own change
he tentatively reaches for some smaller bills in her g string but she dances away
calls to her a ten and five ones when you have the chance
he turns around to talk to jelly but hes already gone
ben finds jelly at a table with vitti
okay paul whats going on

eddie devol enters flanked by his main guys al pacino and hows it goin paulie

al pacino glares at him
i do see a little pacino there around the eyes

he heads for the back of the club with his guys
vitti and jelly start to follow
stops vitti lets do what

lays a hand on his arm im not going until you tell me whats going on here
vitti violently shakes off bens hand
menacing dont make me hurt you
get the fuck out of here
he walks away leaving ben frozen
ben watches as they disappear through a door leading to the back of the club
he starts toward the door
vitti is seated at a big table in the crowded smoke filled room
jelly sits at his side
hes surrounded by his crew about a half a dozen guys and pattys man eddie devol
several street maps and diagrams are spread out on the table
okay this is big and we only get one shot at it and theres only about a million ways this fuckin thing can go bad so listen up
vitti pulls a street map to the center of the table and taps a spot downtown
the federal gold depository in lower manhattan
three times a year a shipment of gold bars goes in a heavily guarded armored truck from the depository to the vault at the federal reserve to hold for foreign
governments that trade in bullion
at three oclock in the morning eight hours from now were gonna hijack that truck
ben enters the back room of the club looks around and starts down the stairwell leading to the basement
ben makes his way down the cramped dimly lit stairway and approaches the door to the basement room
he raises his hand to knock then hesitates and stands there for a moment listening to the muffled voices inside
suddenly he is grabbed from behind and slammed up against the door by enormous bobby
bobby slams him against the door a couple of more times using bens head as a doorknocker
the door is opened by someone inside and enormous bobby shoves ben into the room
ben hits the floor to a chorus of surprised reactions from the guys
enormous bobby pulls ben off the floor by his lapels
what the fuck is this
i found this guy listening at the door
dazed hey guys
hows it going
who is this guy
not looking at eddie ben sobel
sorry i cant move my head to the right
boy i hope thats not permanent
get rid of him
al pacino puts his gun to bens head
still dazed hi carol
youre a dead man asshole
he starts muscling ben to the door
what are you doing
what do you think
he can make every guy in this room
oh im not into that fellas
get your fuckin hands off him
hes with me
what on the job
impatiently either hes in or hes dead
which is it
i think in is better
reluctantly hes in
hes my responsibility
to vitti okay no more surprises
and from this moment on no one leaves my sight
now go through it one more time
okay everybody listen up
agents cerrone and miller watch the front of the club from their car parked across the street
yawns checks watch i wonder what it costs to keep that many limos waiting for three and a half hours
a dozen men looking like vitti and his crew come out of the club and get into the limos
everybody stand by
the limos drive off
at the corner the fbi car pulls out and follows at a discreet distance
the fbi car follows the limos across the bridge into manhattan
the limos pull up at the wwf restaurant
the fbi car stops up the block
over radio all units
the limo doors open and the passengers get out all nondescript nobodies
miller watches intently
i dont see vitti
cerrone stares with the growing awareness that theyve been had
grimly into radio call it off
we lost them
vittis guys are dressed like construction workers as they load their gear into two trucks
vitti supervises while others work on a new york city bus
eddie devol al pacino and enormous bobby stand guard over the whole scene in case anyone is thinking of defecting
ben is wearing heavy dungarees and an oversized plaid shirt struggling to lace his work boots
jelly approaches him and tosses a bulletproof vest on the table
see if thisll fit under your shirt
extremely nervous i could fit you under my shirt
dont they have anything smaller
this aint bloomingdales
nobody knew you were comin
youre lucky youre alive doc
he glances at eddie devol
hisses nobodys going to be alive when this is over
what kind of plan is this
it may be crazy but it aint stupid
if you want to stay alive just keep your mouth shut do everything i tell you and try not to pee in your pants
quietly can you handle an m
he holds up an automatic rifle
you mean shoot it
no i mean twirl it like a fuckin baton
how about an a
he holds up another rifle
exasperated jelly rummaging through pile kalashnikov mac uzi stop me if i hit one you like
ben sees eddie watching him and gingerly picks up a mm handgun
couldnt i just take this
yeah thats a good one
that gun brings back a lot of fond memories
use it in good health
ben puts the gun into the waistband of his dungarees but it slips through and drops into his pants
winces ooh cold cold
he jams his hand down the front of his pants and starts searching around in there
eddie and enormous bobby stare at him as they walk by
explaining my gun fell down in my he shakes his leg and the gun drops out of his cuff and clatters onto the floor
he smiles weakly and picks it up
he looks agitated but under tight control
to jelly check the bus
quietly to ben if we can im gonna get you out before the real shit goes down
just dont flip out on me okay
you are making a huge mistake
you know that dont you
you said it yourself
its my nature
its not your nature
you have a choice
what are you fucking jiminy cricket
i dont know what planet you live on but here on earth its might makes right
read the papers
the guys with the guns make the rules
holding up the pistol so i guess that makes me a real man now
what happened to the white hat paul
your father wasnt wrong
you could be one of the good guys
say one more word about my father and ill break your fuckin head
vitti walks off
vitti comes in locks the door and has a full blown panic attack gasping for breath sweating whimpering trying to stifle his panic
then he sees his tortured face in the mirror and starts pulling himself together
the guys are getting into the trucks
ben keeps letting everybody go in front of him then starts to back away but eddie and enormous bobby come up behind him and push him up into the truck
the big doors open and two trucks roll out carrying vitti ben and the crew
the guys are sitting on the floor in the back of the truck lined up along the sides like paratroopers waiting to jump
ben is sitting next to jelly and across from vitti who is just staring intently
the trucks make their way past the aircraft carrier intrepid heading downtown
vitti ben and eddie devol stand next to the treads of a giant crane
checks his watch i have five to three
they should start movin any minute
looking at his watch i have three o six
lets see your watch
ben slips it off and hands it to him
vitti smashes it on a rock with the butt of his gun then tosses it back to ben
vittis radio squawks and the spotters voice is heard
filtered theyre moving
vitti keys his radio twice as a signal and holds up his clenched fist to alert the guys on site with him
a convoy of vehicles emerges from the bowels of the building and turns onto the street
in front and back are specially equipped suvs full of heavily armed federal marshals an armored truck in the middle carries the gold
the convoy rumbles past a block long high rise construction site totally enclosed by a plywood wall around the perimeter
he can hear the convoy passing outside the wall
he looks down on the convoy from a vantage point on a scaffold high above the street
when the trucks are in the right position he waves to vitti on the ground
sees the signal
on walkie go
a forty foot flat bed trailer truck loaded with cement conduit backs across the street and stops blocking the path of the convoy
the lead suv honks
the truck doesnt move
the captain of the marshals gets out and walks up to the truck
the driver has slipped out the other side and disappeared
suddenly a huge steel claw drops down from above and closes around the top of the armored truck its sharp points crunching into the metal sides
then the truck starts rising off the pavement
a couple of determined marshals jump out of their vehicles race over and grab onto the bumpers as the armored truck is lifted off the ground
a hundred foot tower crane lifts the truck straight up
the marshals hang on as long as they can then prudently let go and drop heavily to the street
two marshals are still clinging to the truck as it rises to a height of thirty feet then swings silently over the perimeter fencing
a bank of arc lights is switched on illuminating the site as the truck is lowered to the ground
heavily armed gangsters in ski masks surround the truck and herd the driver the shotgun guard and the frightened marshals into a construction shack while men with acetylene torches attack
the back doors
vitti pulls down his ski mask and taps ben
paul its not too late
dont do this
he strides off to take charge
ben pulls down his mask and hurries after him but runs right into a pole
he raises his mask and scampers after vitti rubbing the painful bump on his forehead
the marshals run around frantically searching for a way into the construction site
totally in charge he strides up to the armored truck just as his men finish cutting through the steel plate doors
vitti yanks the doors open
vitti and ben stare in awe at the exposed contents of the truck a fortune in gold bars
shouts get the ramp
eddie and his guys run up with a long narrow track with metal rollers and set it up at the rear of the gold truck
very excited you know this might just fuckin work
youre gonna get in so much trouble
the marshals are trying to climb over the construction site wall but theyre stopped by rolls of razor wire and suppressing fire from inside the site
they cant get over the wire
then knock down the gates
the guys take the heavy bars out of the armored truck and run them quickly along the rolling track into the bus
jelly is pulling on the hat and jacket of a transit authority bus driver
the floor boards of the bus have been lifted out and the guys are laying the gold bars in the hollow under the floor
pops his head in forty bars
thats all we need
how much is that
an ounce ounces in a pound pounds in each bar do the math
a beat actually gold is measured in troy ounces
ounces to the pound
that would be
give or take
he hears a loud crash and all eyes turn to the gates
well so much for not peeing in my pants
eddie goes off to help transfer the gold
the marshals back up one of the suvs and run it into the gates again
the big wooden gates shudder but vittis men roll two enormous earthmovers up to reinforce the gates
you know what you said about not flipping out
flipping out what did i do
what did i do
i had a perfect life i threw it away
dont do this
vitti drags him off toward the building structure
i cant help it
my life is over
im going to jail
some people can handle prison im not one of them
i have delicate features
ill be way too popular
i cant calm down
im gonna die
inside the structure vitti spins him around and shakes him
youre not gonna die
i cant breathe
shaking him for chrissake get hold of yourself
were all going to die
suddenly he slaps vitti hard across the face
they both freeze
did i just hit you
feel better now
breaking down im sorry paul
i blame myself for this
i wanted to help you
i wanted to be there for you
but i just wasnt good enough
you were good
it isnt your fault
no it is
since my father died starts crying ive lost my way
i dont know anything anymore
i mean whats the point
i didnt think it would hit me so hard would you just shut up about your father
im grieving goddammit
have a little respect
he was an asshole you said it yourself
what are you grieving for
im grieving for myself you fucking idiot
ben lets it all go sobbing for all the years of pain
surprised shrugs jeez im sorry
now i know how you must have felt when your father was killed
vitti looks at him
crying more i mean it had to be ten times worse for you being murdered right in front of you
and you were so young we dont have time for this
really sobbing it mustve been so painful
eyes filling with tears im warning you dont do this i mean its like all his hopes for you died with him
and thats so sad
starting to cry there i go
you happy now
you see what youre doing here
both men are crying now
your father really loved you
i loved him too
hugs him i know
jelly comes around the corner and sees the two men in a weepy embrace
this is bad
another huge crash as the marshals ram the gates again this time tearing loose one of the big hinges
maybe we oughta should go
vitti ben and jelly run to the bus but eddie pulls a gun and stops them
al and bobby cover jelly and the rest of the crew
vitti backs away slowly
did you really think you were gonna live through this
i had my hopes
yeah well nice work
rigazzi will be very grateful
to vitti rigazzi
i thought he worked for patti lopresti
thats what patty thought too
this scumbags been playin both sides against the middle
theres only one side as far as im concerned
what did you think
i was just gonna stand by and let some fuckin has been move back in
so long mr
he cocks the gun and is about to pull the trigger when ben suddenly roars and slams him in the head with his gun
vitti and jelly quickly cover al pacino and enormous bobby
beating the shit out of eddie i cant take it anymore
thats what i hate about you fucking sociopaths
you just keep changing the rules to suit yourselves
well not this time you anti social asshole
you fucked with the wrong shrink
sitting on eddies chest he presses the gun against eddies nose
dont you read the papers
with the gun makes the rules
they shove eddie enormous bobby and al pacino into the back of the armored truck vitti gives a signal and the crane lifts it off the ground
the armored truck comes down fast and drops heavily to the street
federal marshals swarm the truck and find eddie al and bobby sprawled in the back
screaming on the floor
to eddie nice goin
whats a sociopath
the marshals handcuff them
suddenly the marshals hear automatic weapons fire coming from the next block
uniformed swat cops come running from that direction and shout to the marshals
theyre escaping out the back
get over there
the marshals rush toward the sound of the gunfire and disappear around the corner
as the marshals round the corner they see a police shoot out in progress
wiseguys are firing automatic weapons at cops who are pinned down behind police cruisers
the captain of the marshals fires a warning shot in the air
on a bullhorn freeze
drop your weapons
the head wiseguy anthony bella turns in surprise
what the hell is this
on his own bullhorn cut cut cut
what the hells going on
raoul strides out into the street furious still talking through his bullhorn
to the captain who are you
what are you doing in my shot
the captain and the marshals look around and see that theyre on the set of little caesar
what are you doing on my street
the captain walks toward raoul until they are almost face to face shouting at each other through their bullhorns
i have a permit
i dont give a shit about your permit
the assistant director addresses the tv crew
all right people
back to one and lets try it again
into his walkie talkie release the traffic and reset for another take
on the perimeters of the set the pas signal the off duty cops who work the set to release the real traffic theyve been holding on the cross streets
a city bus passes behind raoul and tony bella who are still screaming at the federal marshal
in mid block swat cops step into the street and wave the bus to a halt
ben is sitting in the back with vitti as the helmeted swat cops board the bus
sees them coming thats it
the cops walk toward the back and confront ben
youre one tough shrink
the cops unmask
its mo mo cokes and tuna
they laugh and slap hands with vitti and ben
the bus pulls out and joins the flow of traffic heading downtown
all the guys are looking pretty happy with their score
ben turns to vitti
feeling pretty good huh
i felt worse
so what now
you go on the run for the rest of your life
back to sing sing
or you turn up dead in an alley
those are my choices
what happened to lying on a beach in costa rica for the next twenty years
you cant let me enjoy this for five fuckin minutes
and then what
and then what
ill show you
a rigazzi company van is forced open by a team of fbi agents led by agent miller
stacked inside are forty gold bars
agent cerrone comes out of the building with lou rigazzi and several associates in handcuffs
attorney chapin makes a statement to the media
acting on intelligence we developed in the last few days the justice department and the f
took very aggressive action to recover the stolen gold and bring the perpetrators to justice
im happy to tell the people of new york that the streets are safe again
vitti knocks on the front door
patty answers it in her robe
howd it go

i never shouldve trusted eddie
but you know a woman alone in the world is very vulnerable
yeah i know

thanks to you
i told you i just want to be left
ill make sure
how about some breakfast
i could make you some waffles and whatever else you want
she adjusts her robe providing vitti a quick peek
cant do that
patty smiles and shrugs
well if you ever change your mind kisses him good luck paul
ben is leaning against the railing gazing at the water when vitti walks up
did you see patti
ruefully did she grab your balls
what kind of question is that
shes just happy to have the wrench out of the way
well i talked to the u
did he grab your balls

vitti stops and turns

belting somehow someday somewhere
the orchestra swells as we crane up to the brooklyn bridge and lower manhattan beyond
a little boy in a cowboy suit sitting on a pony as his father leads him around the ring
