brazil the screenplay brazil screenplay draft a beautiful golden sun is setting
the sky is on fire
the camera starts to move downwards
a large neon sign rises into shot
it rests on top of a skyscraper and fills the frame
the building is neither past nor future in design but a bit of both
slowly we pan downwards revealing the city that spreads below
a glittering conglomeration of elevated transport tubes smaller square buildings which are merely huge with here and there the comparatively minuscule relics of previous ages of architecture pavement level awnings
suggesting restaurants and shops
transparent tubes carry whizzing transport cages past us
an elevated highway carrying traffic composed primarily of large transport lorries passes thru frame
as we descend the sunlight is blocked out and street lights neon signs take over as illumination
eventually we reach the upper levels of a plush shopping precinct
xmas decorations are everywhere
people are busy buying ogling discussing choosing wisely from the goodies on display
shoppers are going by laden with superbly packaged goods
the shop windows are full of elaborately boxed and be ribboned who knows what
in one window is a bank of tv sets on the great majority of the screens is the face of mr
helpmann the deputy minister of information
he is being interviewed
no one bothers to listen to helpmann
deputy minister what do you believe is behind this recent increase in terrorist bombings
a ruthless minority of people seems to have forgotten certain good old fashioned virtues
they just cant stand seeing the other fellow win
if these people would just play the game instead of standing on the touch line heckling in fact killing people in fact killing people theyd get a lot more out
we pull away from the shop to concentrate on the shoppers
helpmanns voice carries over the rest of the scene
helpmann what would you say to those critics who maintain that the ministry of information has become too large and unwieldy
in a free society information is the name of the game
you cant win the game if youre a man short
fur bedecked shoppers pass in front of what appears to be banks of snow but as we pan along with them the snow turns out to be fire fighting foam
it oozes out of a shop front that is a charred twisted mass of metal frames
workmen are busily sealing the opening with plywood sheets shoppers pay no attention to this
xmas carols are being played by a salvation army style band calling themselves consumers for christ
santa clauss grotto is busy all is well with the world
and the cost of it all deputy minister
seven percent of the gross national produce
i understand this concern on behalf of the tax payers
people want value for money and a cost effective service
cut to tv screen with helpmann still talking
that is why we always insist on the principle of information retrieval charges
these terrorists are not pulling their weight and its absolutely right and fair that those found guilty should pay for their periods of detention and the information retrieval procedures used
in their interrogation
pull back to reveal a rather clinical office
the tv rests on a desk
a white coated technician is sorting out his in tray
several christmas cards are amongst he paperwork
he comes upon a christmassy package which he rips open to discover a shiny metal executive toy
cut to the beetle droning up near the ceiling
the technician is disturbed by the buzz of the beetle as it whirrs around the fluorescent light
he rolls up some paper and forms and gets up to swat the insect
the technician gets up and balances a chair on top of his desk
he climbs up onto it attempting to swat the beetle still buzzing about the room just out of reach
beneath him an automatic type writing machine rattles away compiling a typed list of names under the heading information retrieval subjects for detention interview
the machine is being fed from a spool of paper which is being rhythmically chopped by an automatic guillotine which neatly leaves each name on a separate sheet with the
title above each name each sheet following its predecessor into a holding basket
in close up we see the names on the sheets of paper building up in the holding basket tonsted simon
topper martin f
trollope benjamin g
turb william k
turner john d
every name begins with t
do you think that the government is winning the battle against terrorists
our morale is much higher than theirs were fielding all their strokes running a lot of them out and pretty consistently knocking them for six
id say theyre nearly out of the game
the technician is tottering on one leg on the chair on the desk as he strains to swat the beetle
swish swash oops whap
but the bombing campaign is now in its thirteenth year
the beetles career comes to a halt
squashed flat on the brilliantly clean ceiling
or has it
as the technician clambers down from the rickety heights the beetles carcass comes unstuck from the ceiling and drops silently into the typewriting machine which hiccoughs hesitates and then types
the letter b and hesitates and then continues so that the next name is buttle archibald
the technician fails to notice this and the machine continues smoothly tutwood thomas t
thank you very much deputy minister
thank you david
and a very merry christmas to you all
zooming past foreground outdoor xmas decorations we tighten in on one of several massive residential tower blocks that loom over what appears to be a poorer part of the city
helpmann and interviewer are on the tv the end credits rolling over them to the beat of a mozart theme tune
pulling back we reveal that the tv is in a conventional sitting room conventionally decorated for christmas out the room is oddly encumbered by huge metal conduits that snake unpleasantly
across and through the walls
smaller conduits radiate from the main one connecting the various services that central services the name emblazoned on the metal supply to this household
a conventionally poor but proud family occupies the room
mrs buttle is reading dickens christmas carol to girl buttle who is about six
boy buttle plays quietly with a toy machine gun and some action men dressed in security gear
buttle is putting the final touches to a neatly wrapped christmas present which looks identical to the executive toy we have just seen in he technicians office
faintly from outside comes a burst of laughter
a tilt of the camera indicates that the laughter is coming from the floor above
the flat is very bare and basic
the laughter is coming from a cheap portable television showing sgt
from bilkos pov we look through an open door of a bathroom straight at a mirror propped up by the bath to enable the person in the bath to watch
the person in the bath is jill layton washing the grime off herself while she watches bilko in the mirror
from her pov in the mirror the t
screen is suddenly obscured by part of the body of a man in uniform
scared whos there
the buttle family as before
mrs buttle is closing the book
there thats enough for tonight
he wont come xmas eve if you dont get plenty of sleep
father christmas cant come if we havent got a chimney
the girl exchanges goodnight kisses with her parents and leaves the room
how will he get down from upstairs
its a secret
we follow girl buttle out of the sitting room into
girl buttle enters her bedroom
there is little or no light there and she sees a bulky figure apparently lowering himself into the room from the direction of the ceiling
unalarmed youve come
as she moves the light from the hallway shows us the figure of what looks like a commando on a night raid slowly sliding down a pole in he middle
of the room
the pole at the top end disappears through a hole in the ceiling
things become immediately clearer crash
its a raid
battle dressed security troops smash trough the door
another one swings from a rope kicks in the window from the outside and enters that way
most alarmingly of all a shower of plaster comes down from the ceiling in which a fairly neat round hole appears and through the hole comes a firemans pole down
which slide two more security troops
the whole thing is short brutal and violent
buttle is grabbed violently and stuffed into a baglike canvas device that covers him from head to waist
a metal clamp goes round his neck a metal bar slides up the back of the bag
his hands are handcuffed to the metal bar
in seconds he has become a canvas parcel
meanwhile girl buttle has been carried out of her bedroom and dumped into the lap of her screaming mother
boy buttle has his toy machine gun knocked out of his hands by a trooper who we see is identical in dress to the action men boy buttle has been
he rushes to his mother as guns are viciously trained on them
troops are kicking open the doors of other rooms and generally doing a good job
an official wearing plain clothes now enters from the front door and during the turmoil is reading aloud from an official document
it goes something like this i hereby inform you under powers entrusted to me under section paragraph of council order number that mr buttle archibald residing at north tower shangri
la towers has been invited to assist the ministry of information with certain enquiries the nature of which may be ascertained on completion of application form bz st c fourteen days within this date and that he is liable to certain obligations as specified in council order including financial restitutions which may or may not be incurred if information retrieval procedures beyond those incorporated in article subsections are required to elicit information leading to permanent arrest notification of which will he served with the time period of working days as stipulated by law
in that instance the detainee will be debited without further notice through central banking procedures without prejudice until and unless at such a time when re imbursement procedures may be
instituted by you or third parties on completion of a re imbursement form rb cz x
and more of the same most of which is part of the audible wall paper while the chaos reigns
as the front door slams behind the captive relative peace returns broken by mrs buttles anguished sobbing
proffering a pen and a thick book of pink receipts to mrs buttle sign here please
she signs weakly what
where have you taken him
taking the book thank you
he hands her another book this one of blue receipts indicating place to sign same again please
checking first book of receipts press harder his time
signing again what is this all about
tearing out sheet from pink book thats your receipt for your husband
taking blue book from her thank you
and this is my receipt for your receipt
he turns to leave along with troopers jills shocked face appears looking down through the hole in the ceiling
the faces of the workmen bill and charlie also appear above and behind her
mrs buttle are you alright
the helmeted security troops in buttles flat drop to defensive positions and swing their machine guns up towards the hole in the ceiling
all three faces retreat
starting back from the hole with bill and jill eh
were department of works
department of works up here
careful with those bloody things
jill charlie and bill are hustled aside by a security man who clears the firemans pole from the hole
we can see the troops in the room below leaving
a second security man has untied a rope hanging out of the open window
he coils the rope up neatly and the two security men leave the flat
to jill as they watch this highly efficient operation dont take any notice love its their training makes them like animals
best in the world though
who are you
dont you worry love well have everything shipshape in a jiffy
nothing to worry about
its buttle downstairs who can worry eh
there must be some mistake
mr buttles harmless
we dont make mistakes
so saying he drops the manhole cover which is faced with same material as the floor over the hole in the floor
to his surprise it drops neatly through the floor into the flat below
bloody typical theyve gone back to metric without telling us a int
buttles flat night a mrs buttle stands stunned in the middle of her decimated flat
the kids wail
slowly mrs buttle collapses slumping to the floor with the receipt in her hand we tighten into close up of receipt
jill off camera mrs buttle
we come in on a close up of a pink version of the receipt being stamped and impaled on desk spike as we pull out to reveal an infinite expanse
of regularly arranged metal desks each desk with a built in t
console and each except one occupied by a clerk
every desk is snowed under with pieces of paper much like the receipts seen in the previous scene
more pacers are delivered to each desk intermittently by way of pneumatic tube
office boys bustle about with even more paperwork
from the back of the room we get a view of the screens which show graphs tabulations figures
all of this activity is supervised from an elevated walkway by mr kurtzman
satisfied that all is well with his clerks he turns and walks towards his glass enclosed private office at the top of the room his name lettered on the opaque
mr kurtzman goes through this door and as he closes it behind him all activity in the clerks pool ceases
each clerk adjusts his t
screen with the flick of a switch and all the screens change to something which looks very like the good the bad and the ugly
mr kurtzman also has a t
he sits behind his desk reaches for his in tray and without looking at the console he turns his screen on
he looks through a number of files in his in tray
he is surprised to hear a voice say turn around real slow amigo
mr kurtzman turns around real slow his expression relaxes he thumps his t
console with a large fist and the screen obediently flicks to a display of figures
he picks up a file which we see as marked buttle archibald
he opens the file and starts punching the keyboard of the console
starts bleeping in an alarmed way
mr kurtzman is puzzled
he punches more figures
the screen starts to flash error error error
mr kurtzman sighs with frustration
he presses an intercom
into intercom mr lowry will you step in here please
he returns his attention puzzled to the file
nobody comes into the office
mr kurtzman gets up and walks over to his door and opens it
beyond the door the room full of clerks is obediently concentrating on the bleeping and whirring consoles
from mr kurtzmans pov we see that in the centre of the room is an unoccupied desk
does anyone know where lowry is
mr kurtzman closes his door again
a moment later it seems to him and to us that he has heard the crash of six guns blazing away at each other
he re opens the door
the only sound again
he goes back to his desk
he punches a few keys
the machine starts emitting even more alarming beeps then horse whinnies then admit youre whupped you drygulching scum
kurtzman explodes with anger and presses the intercom again
shouting into intercom where the hell is sam lowry
cut to brilliantly clear sky
from on high an odd bird like figure swoops down on the camera
as it comes closer we can see that it is in fact a man wearing strange wood and metal bird wings
in the bright sunshine their flapping movements create a brilliant flashing effect
along with the wings sam lowry for this is he wears an outfit that combines the best of flash gordon and a wwi fighter pilot
he sweeps past the camera and then banking rises back into shot in mcu
an ethereal voice can be heard calling sam
he hovers looking beyond the camera to something wonderful
cut to face of stunningly beautiful girl she is the idealised twin of jill layton
her long hair swirls across her face partially obscuring it and making her appear slightly mysterious
the camera pulls away from her as soft billowing material sinuously undulates about her
it rises and falls like waves carried on the wind
as the camera glides back through this sea of gossamer we can see that the girl is being held aloft by and in it
a vast landscape stretches below her
the sun frames her in the sky
she and sam are engaged in a beautiful sensual aerial ballet
romantic music fills the soundtrack
sam swoops up and away
the girl floats in the distance as sam
rises in the foreground
she beckons to him
sam begins to flap back towards her
but then the dreamy quality of this scene is interrupted by threatening rumble
sam looks down
the ground far below him suddenly erupts as a massive monolithic stone skyscraper bursts through the surface and soars upwards with a mighty rush
cut to the girl in long shot
the monolith rises up into frame partially cutting her off from view
before sam can do anything another stone skyscraper breaks through the ground and rushes upwards
then another and another
there is nothing sam can do
the girl is being cut of from him by these gigantic faceless structures
and then she is finally lost from view somewhere in the depths of this strange stone metropolis
sam lies closer
the stone skyscrapers appear to be solid
nothing whatsoever to interfere with their clean harsh rectilinear design
as he flies among these towering blocks he sees no sign of the girl only sheer walls rising high above him
below him the walls plummet vertiginously into the darkish streets
no sound but the creaking flapping of his wings can he heard in this dead place
coming round a corner he sees something in the distance
far below him a dark procession is wending its way through the narrow passages
away from him
cut to low angle shot of the procession making its way past the camera
black robed and cowled the sinister figures look like heavily armed monks
these are the forces of darkness
together they are straining at several heavy hawsers that rise in long arcs up to a huge metal cage floating above and behind the procession
binding the cage are metal straps to which ropes are attached
inside is the girl still enveloped in gossamer which billows as if there were a breeze in constant attendance
cut to sam as he dives out of shot
cut to the forces of darkness suddenly stopping in their tracks
theyve seen something
cut to their pov
there at the end of the passage between two stone skyscrapers stands sam
barring the way
cut to swords being unsheathed
cowls being thrown back
underneath are rotting broken dolls faces
all the faces are the same except for the manner in which they have decayed
they smile slobbering sickeningly
suddenly the robed bodies change shape some rising up to become long others expanding sideways to become bulbous others shrinking
from the folds of cloth come evil weapons
the forces are massed ready to charge
cut to long shot of sam
he removes his arms from his wings and folds the wings behind him
he is ready
cut to the forces
except for the constant dribble from their cracked mouths
cut back to sam
the tension is unbearable
suddenly sam unleashes a terrifying scream and charges the fearsome horde
cut to the forces thundering down to sam
weapons flailing madly
sam skillfully dodges the swordthrust of the leading field and karate chops him senseless at the same time catching his sword as he falls
spinning around he parries a spearthrust and skewers a third attacker
he lays waste to the forces
nothing can stop this boy
the pile of black robed bodies grows with each swing of sams sword
sam carves his way through the mob with nary a scratch
and then suddenly they are all dead but a heap of blackness to commemorate sams prowess
the girl is beaming as sam makes his way toward the hawsers holding the cage
but then a noise behind him makes him turn
there behind him the pile of black shapes begin to rise
the ropes become a mass of flapping black cloth
this evil churning cloud coalesces and lifts off the ground
the horrible flapping apparition emits a terrifying maniacal laughter as it flies away
sam is about to rush after it to halt its escape but is stopped by the sound of a telephone ringing
he looks around confused
tight shot of telephone
the ringing continues
a hand grapples with the receiver
sam is in bed in a darkened room
sleepily he drags receiver to his ear
youre up late
oh is it
there is an electronic box of tricks by his bed incorporating an alarm
sam thumps it
the alarm goes off
this sets of a series of other things
the window shutters roll up letting in the morning light
both taps turn on in the bathroom
into phone the electronics here are up the spout
yours too sir
dont worry sir ill be there
sam puts down the phone and gets into his suit which is moving towards him
noticing one of his film posters is loose he pushes the pin in firmly
in the kitchen a coffee maker starts up
in the sitting room the television switches on
back in the bedroom a cupboard door springs open and a rack slides out with sams clothes neatly hanging ready to be put on
sam comes out of the bathroom having turned off the bath taps and starts to get dressed
in the kitchen the coffee maker has finished making s small pot of coffee
sam pours a quick cup and is gone at the door
throughout all this we have had a chance to get a glimpse of sams flat
it is functional soulless and though neat has not been assembled with a loving hand
most of the furnishings are built in
the walls are divided into two foot square metal panels painted a non committal colour
certain of the wall panels have central services logos on them with the admonition do not obstruct or remove below
sam has livened his bedroom up with large and colorful film posters
the sitting room sports several framed pictures of wide beautiful vistas
this is a gigantic vaguely s monumental style building
the lobby is a vast impressive space containing reception desks fountains statues etc
prominent are the security measures which include automatic mobile cameras video screens and groups of security men who search all who enter
sam is finishing going through security when he meets jack who is on his way out of the building
long time no see
well since you disappeared up the ladder of information retrieval
i dont expect to see you slumming in records whats the problem
no problem yes everythings going fantastically well wonderful marvelous great career prospects alison in great shape kids fine beautiful home im on security level five now and mr helpmann relies
on me more and more yes couldnt be better i feel terrifically motivated and job rewarded you sound worried
if im worried about anyone its you
what happened to you sam
you were the brightest of us as they have been talking a nearby bank of closed circuit tv screens has been displaying shots of people entering the lobby
as each one enters the camera zooms in tight on their faces for a frozen close up
jill has just entered and the camera zooms in and freezes on her face
sam happens to glance up at this moment
he is startled the over exposed tv image is the face of the girl from the dream
the face is only there a few seconds before being replaced by another picture
sam looks about to see where the girl is but jill in overalls has her back to him as she stands in the queue for the information desk and so
there is no one even vaguely reminiscent of the dream girl
sam decides he must have imagined it
over this jack has been talking
whats the matter
snapping out of it see you im going to be late
looking at his watch you are late
sam your life is going wrong let your friends tell you records is a dead end department no security level worth a damn its impossible to get noticed yes i
know fantastic marvellous wonderful remember me to alison and the er twins
god how time flies
as sam heads off to the lift he passes a group of men standing around a temporary tv monitor
several of them are dressed in white lab coats
they are being explained the benefits of a new surveillance system by a salesman type
his assistant is operating the controls
on the monitor we can see jill standing in the queue for the information desk
the camera appears to he tracking in on her
cut to jill at top of queue with several forms in her hand
a strange prototype radio controlled camera on a wheeled base is whirring and clicking as it approaches her
throughout the next sequence it pokes around jill in an annoying manner thrusting itself at her face trying to see what is written on the forms peering over her shoulder
jill hands a form to the information porter
i want to report a wrongful arrest
looking at form you want information adjustments
exasperated but controlled ive been to information adjustments
they sent me here
they told me you had a form i had to fill in
have you got an arrest receipt
is it stamped
producing buttle receipt stamped
examining receipt no theres no stamp on it
i cant give you the form until its stamped
where do i get it stamped
the radio controlled camera noses right up to jills face as she turns
she swats the annoying thing with her stack of forms as she storms off
the camera overbalances and crashes into the desk sparking and spluttering
cutting back to the group around the monitor we see a deeply hurt salesman and several sceptical white coated sam is busily working at the console unraveling a problem while
kurtzman looks on anxiously and ineffectually
perhaps the machines on the blink
it keeps picking up old films
that cant he right can it
its not the machine
theres a mismatch on the personnel code numbers
ah there we go
thats a b when it should be a t tuttle
he should have
debited against his account for electrical procedures not buttle
oh my god a mistake
its not our mistake
eagerly isnt it
whose is it
expediting has put in for electrical procedures in respect of buttle archibald shoe repair operative but security has invoiced admin for tuttle archibald heating engineer sam is still punching keys
what a relief
i dont know what id do if you ever got promoted
but if they did promote you ive told you before
id turn it down
would you really sam
churned up youve been promoted
kurtzman hands sam a sheet of printed paper
sam takes the paper not pleased and glances at it
close up of paper lowry s
min of inf
transfer to information retrieval expediting security level
its your mother isnt it
pulling strings again
explodes what a bitch
cut to an old womans face reflected in triplicate in a three panelled mirror
a pair of mans hands have a grip on her flabby cheeks pulling them out several inches on either side of her face
when i say several inches thats just what i mean
not only are her jowls being stretched like silly putty but they are also being wrapped around to the back of her neck to demonstrate how tight and smooth her
face can be made by doctor who is prattling on over this freak show
now when you come in tomorrow mrs lowry well make a little tuck here and there
cut to wide shot of doctors surgery
it looks a bit like a cross between an operating theatre and a boudoir
the cold steel glass and plastic surfaces are badly disguised with pastel coloured chintz and satin
at the dressing table sits the old woman sams mother
behind her stands the doctor
he is much like his surgery
he has tailored his surgical garments like a gigolos dressing gown
it seems that he has done a bit of tuck taking on himself
there is a certain plastic smoothness to his skin but all in all he has been fairly successful
sam is pacing around raving
angrily i just wish you would stop interfering mother
i dont want promotion
im happy where i am
no youre not
jack lint is a lesson to you he never had your brains but hes got the ambition
you havent got the ambition but luckily youve got me
and mr helpmann
mr helpmann was very close now mrs lowry dont get upset so sam please wait in reception mr lowry youre giving her wrinkles
groans now mrs lowry try to relax
you must trust me
ill make you twenty years younger
giving sam a dirty look twenty five if we just drain the excess fluid from the pouches
dr jaffe youre a genius
would you like to be surgeon general
i know everybody
well they wont know you when ive finished with you
the doctor reaches into his smock pocket for a coloured marker
he starts colouring up her face with strokes of different coloured markers
first we must eliminate the excess derma
then the flaccid tissues under the eyes
and now the forehead
i lift the wrinkles and worry lines right up into the wi into the hairline comme ca
sam looks disgusted
and now the template
now a bit of sticky
there we go
triumphantly already she is twice as beautiful as she was before voila
the doctor moves his body aside revealing mrs lowrys face covered with coloured lines and wrapped in cellophane held in shape by cellotape
sam stares at her
my god it works
the conversation between sam and his mother takes place while they are going through the sort of security checks familiar at airports
they are however just outside the velvet rope of the posh restaurant
in full flow mr helpmann was very close to your poor father
he was very close to me
hell take you under his wing at information retrieval
youll like it when you get there
youre not listening mother
a warning buzzer goes off as mothers handbag goes thru security check
it turns out to have been activated by a gaily wrapped package
a security guard relieves her of it and unwraps the package which contains the same kind of executive toy which we have seen twice before
its a present for my son
she takes the toy back and hands it to sam
i hope you like it
its very exclusive
what is it
its something for executives
at this point the maitre d arrives on the scene
madam lowry how exquisite to see you again
he pulls aside he velvet rope with a grand flourish
he looks disdainfully at sams unfashionable clerks suite hello spiro
blocking sams way im sorry but
you remember samuel my son
suddenly unctious oh but of course
were meeting mrs terrain
ah yes the lady is waiting
spiro leads the way
sam and his mother follow across the restaurant which is much like the palm court at the plaza new york
trellises marble columns antique mirroring potted palms combine to impress us with their sophistication and taste
a string quartet can just be made out against the far wall
except for the unfortunate intrusion of metal tubing and ducting brutally thrusting across areas of the ceiling occasionally penetrating right through the middle of a particularly valuable looking mirror the
general effect is one of confident wealth and breeding
sam mother and maitre d make their way across the room
the waltzing strains of the string quartet accompanying them
cut to group of tables with diners
at one of them sits a wealthy looking older woman with a rather plain looking daughter in her s
the older woman is easily distinguished from the other clientele by a large bandage that covers a goodish part of her head
the two of them the mother and daughter not the mother and bandage are perusing the menus
sam notes the daughter unpleased
mother i thought we were going to be able to talk
oh god shes got whats he name with her
sam and his mother arrive at the table
alma how are you
youre looking wonderful
shy to sam salt
to shirley not yet
to sam and mother happy christmas sam
she hands sam a gaily wrapped package which obviously contains the same executive toy
sorry were late
shall we order
get it out of the way
what are you going to have alma
she starts to hunt through the huge menu the maitre d has just handed her with full colour photos of the splendid dishes available
i cant make up my mind whether to have a number one or a number two
what do you recommend spiro
conspiratorially between you and me madam today the number two
thank you spiro
shirley what are you going to have
panics quietly conspiratorially between you and me mademoiselle today the number one
oh to hell with the diet a number eight please
a most perceptive choice madam if i may say so
to sam monsieur
brusquely a steak please
to his mother mother i need to
handing back menu i dont know which numero
writing on pad numero trois
everyone is a bit embarrassed here
mother gives sam a withering look
spiro stalks away
trying to restart things alma you wicked thing
indicating bandages youve started your treatment
enthusiastically i must tell you all about it
to his mother mother will you listen to at this moment the food arrives
spiro elaborately lifts off the silver covers and with a flourish distributes the plates of food
each order looks identical a big splodge of brown lumpy stuff
the only differences between the lumps are the identifying photographs on sticks stuck in each
the beautiful colour photos match the photos which were on the menus
showing off that he remembers whos ordered what numero huit braised veal in wine sauce
he sets it in front of sams mother its too exciting
ive left dr jaffe and gone to dr
numero deux duck a lorange
he sets it in front of mrs terrain the acid man
really ida just because his techniques are revolutionary
i dont go around calling dr jaffe the knife man
numero une crevettes a la mayonaaise
he sets it in front of shirley im sorry alma i didnt mean to sound so
thats all right ida
its just that hes such an artist
to him cutting is so crude
numero trois steak
he sets this in front of sam monsieur mesdames bon appetit
acid on the other hand can be used for such wonderfully subtle shading such delicate nuances just like a rembrant etching
and its so much quicker
why if it werent for a teensy weensy complication the doctor said it could have happened to anyone i would have had these bandages off yesterday
to sam after attracting her mothers attention and receiving a nod salt
they are just about to dip into their respective splodges when there is a terrific explosion a huge hole is blasted out of the wall to the kitchen
chaos erupts around the carnage as waiters try putting out the flames with extinguishers
people bloody and dying are moaning
the diners not actually affected by the blast look up for a moment and then with a few raised eyebrows go back to their meals
what were we saying
picking bomb debris out of his brown lump this isnt rare
by the way i saw a wonderful idea for christmas presents at the chemists
medical gift tokens
oh that sounds marvellous
yes theyre good at any doctors and at many of the major hospitals and theyre accepted for gynecological complications including caesarian section
sam in the act of taking in another forkful of his unappetising meal drops his form in disgust look please im sorry but honestly mother this is i quite agree
mother raises her arm to gain the attention of the maitre d who is frantically trying to deal with the emergency
the activity in the background has increased throughout the conversation
the fire brigade has arrived with sirens blaring
ministry troops have charged in and are arresting waiters
stretchers have been bought in for the injured and these are being rushed past our little groups table
the maitre d comes to the table his dj now blood spattered
i am sorry madam
i dont know what to say
this very rarely happens to us ill do what i can straight away he hurries away
really sam when are you going to do something about these terrorists
its my lunch hour
actually alma thats one of the little things i was dying to tell you sams been promoted to information retrieval
angry and surprised mother
oh thats wonderful
you can show those fucking murderous bastards a thing or two
shocked and embarrassed shirley
leaping to his feet im not being promoted
im not going to information retrieval
he scrumples promotion notification which he has been holding and throws it on the floor if i want you to stick your oar in mother ill tell you where to
everybody is shocked
he recovers his composure slightly
embarrassed he bends and picks up the ball of paper which he starts smoothing back into its flat state
back to her uncertain form pepper
look ive got to get back as sam goes maitre d reappears with a group of waiters those remaining unarrested whom he has organised to gut up a folding screen
around the table
this cuts of the sight if not the noise of the victims of the explosion
you havent had dessert
i don t want dessert
i dont want promotion
i dont want anything
dont be childish samuel
of course you want something
you must have hopes wishes dreams
their voices have been rising towards a shout in order to rise above the volume of the growing chaos around them
shouts loud sam as his dream self rises into shot his wings straining as he tows the floating cage imprisoning the girl
they are rising up and away from the monolithic stone skyscrapers that stretch away below them
im taking you to a safe place
a place where they will never be able to get at us
an eyeball is scanning the sky
pulling back we see it is but one of thousands tightly packed side by side forming a landscape that extends as far as we can see
as sam and the girl in her cage come into view it becomes apparent just how big these eyeballs are they are gigantic about feet in diameter
all of them follow sam as he comes to rest on a platform high atop a column that rises from the centre of this bizarre place
theres no way they can approach us without being seen
youre safe here
he anchors the hawser holding the cage and takes off his wings
just as he starts climbing up to the cage a terrific cracking noise is heard
a dead straight crack is bisecting the sky from somewhere beyond the horizon running right up the sky and over the camera
sam follows it as it continues over the girl and down to the opposite horizon
another crackling noise is heard
another crack appears
all these cracks are emanating from a vanishing point over the horizon
soon the sky is covered with these cracks from horizon to foreground
then cracks begin appearing at right angles to them
very quickly the sky is covered with a mammoth grid
once it is complete another noise is heard
something like massive blocks of stone sliding against one another
one of the squares formed by the grid pattern begins to slide upwards as if being pulled out from the back side of the sky
a square hole is left in its place
we can see the sides of the hole as it extends upwards into blackness
as soon as this first block of sky is withdrawn another begins to slide up and away
sam is frozen in position as this terrifying spectacle goes on above him
the eyeballs are madly looking this way and that
the grinding noises are deafening as block after block of sky is removed
with each successive loss the light decreases
the girl is crying out for sam to save her
frantically sam tries to haul the cage down to the platform but its too late
where the sky was is now pitch black
only one block of sky remains
slowly that final bit of sky is pulled up and out of shot
a maniacal laughter can be heard
a beam of light is switched on
sam has a searchlight in his hand and is searching the darkness
the laughter continues
suddenly the beam catches something black and moving
its the same black flapping cloth that appeared at the end of the previous dream
the horrible flapping thing comes thundering down on sam
he is engulfed in the black awfulness
sam is in bed grappling with the bedclothes
he is dripping with sweat and screaming
the room is oppressively hot
he gets up and looks at the thermostat
he fumbles with it but to no avail
cut to sam coming into the sitting room
he rushes over to the window and tries to open it
but it wasnt designed to be opened
screws hold it firmly shut
sam heads to the kitchen he finds a knife which he uses to unscrew the window
he swings the window open and takes a deep breath
a terrible greeny brown smog pours in through the window
desperately sam shuts the window and madly tightens up the screws
swinging a newspaper he tries clearing a path through the clouded atmosphere
he makes it to the front door and staggers out into the hall gasping for air
cut to telephone being lifted from its cradle
pull back as sam with opened telephone directory in front of him dials
he is seated in his kitchen
in front of his open refrigerator
the phone rings at the other end
into phone hello central services im at b block l northwestern section d thats exit on green pastures highway at the orange blossom flyover and ive got trouble with the
air conditioning thank you or calling central services
am sorry due to temporary staff shortage central services cannot take service calls centrally between and hours have a nice day this has not been a recording incident this is
thank you for calling central services
i am sorry due yes but
ive got to have a heating engineer thank you for calling cen sam slams the phone down
cut to sam sitting in front of the refrigerator
the door is open and he has wedged a chair into the gap in a desperate bid to keep cool
he is nodding off
as his head slumps against one of the shelves a jar of pickled onions falls to the floor
the onions scattering everywhere
the milky white spheres tumble everywhere
but they are not onions they are the giant eyeballs burtling through space
sam is clinging desperately to one
he grabs the pupil for a better handhold and it opens like a hatch cover
sam manages to pull himself inside
once out of the intergalactic maelstrom sam turns to survey the cramped and dark space inside the eyeball
it seems to be bisected by a dividing wall from which a thin sliver of light is escaping
pushing on the wall in the area of the slit sam is able to move a section
more light shaftes into the tiny space from around the edges of what appears to be a small hatch
sam scrunches down and really puts his shoulder to the hatch
with a metallic rasp it gives way and sam crashes through
cut to other side of opening as sam topples through
he catches himself in the nick of time as the camera zooms back revealing his close call with disaster
he is high on a vast wall of what looks like filing cabinets
the hatch he came through was the front of one of the millions of files drawers composing this wall
as he scrambles back into the opening we can see that the wall drops away for hundreds of feet disappear into a steaming mist
other walls of files enclose this vast space
from where sam is it looks like the view from the th storey of the time life building in nyc
these millions of files are being tended by men arising themselves up and down as well as sideways on modern skyscraper window cleaners platforms
the attendants are seen putting people in different period costumes into drawers
sams attention is distracted by a sound overhead
looking up he sees a window washer platform being lowered in his direction
leaning over the side is a jolly gent who happens to look like mr helpmann as seen on tv
there you are sam
how do you know my name
we know everything here
this is the storeroom of knowledge
climbing onto the platform then perhaps you can help me
ive lost someone who
interrupting we know that too
youve come to the right place
the platform carries them along the files
weve got everything here
every bit of knowledge wisdom learning
every experience every thought neatly filed away
you mean youve got
well not exactly
but if you help us well help you
the forces of darkness have won the day
but tomorrow is another one what do i have to do
you must save the day
the platform has stopped
the gent pulls out a drawer
he reaches inside
the gent pulls out a wonderful sword and helmet
this is the sword of truth
and this the helmet of justice
as sam begins to strap on the weapon the gent brings out a cape
completes the outfit
he puts the cape around sams shoulders and helps him step into the drawer
a moments hesitation and then sam outs the helmet on and lies down in the drawer
it fits just like a coffin
as he lies back the gent pushes the drawer in
it wont be pleasant but trust me
as the drawer is pushed in sam suffers a sudden bout of claustrophobia
looking up at the diministing opening he is surprised to see not the face of the jolly gent but a terrifying samurai warriors masked helmet
sam struggles to prevent the drawer being closed
sam is grabbing the walls of the fridge
water from the defrosted freezer compartment drips on his head
he wakes up
before he can really take in where he is the phone rings
he staggers over to it
pause a sound at the kitchen door turns sams head and ours just in time to half see a quick blurred movement but then a rapid voice in his ear
piece brings his head back
put the phone down and your hands up
into the phone what
who is this
sam realises that the voice is also in the room behind him
he turns round and sees tuttle
tuttle is middle aged a short tough figure dressed in dark clothes suggesting a cross between a cat burglar and a night raid commando
in one hand he holds a gun pointed at sam
the other hand is holding a telephone receiver which tuttle is in the act of placing in the large capacious bag at his feet
sam puts down his phone and his hands up
nice and easy now
keep your hands where i can see them
what is this
indignantly who the hell are you
tuttle keeping the gun on sam goes to different doors leaning backwards into bedroom bathroom and closet
tuttle suddenly relaxes and pockets his gun
at your service
are you from central services
i called central services
theyre a bit overworked these days
luckily i intercepted your call
by now both are pouring with sweat
tuttle heads across the room and swiftly begins to undo a wall panel
wait a minute what was that business with the gun
tuttle hands sam the panel and plunges his arm into the space behind it
a little precaution sir
ive had traps set for me before now
there are people in central services whod love to get their hands on harry tuttle
are you saying this is illegal
by now tuttle has managed to pull out some sections of flexible ducting from the welter of mechanical offal behind the removed panel
it is all very complicated and greasy and it looks as though there is a lot more where that came from
tuttle is amazingly neat and deft as he works
a real pro
as he works he hums a wee tune
yes well yes
officially only central service operatives are supposed to touch this stuff
could you hold these
he hands sam a bunch of wires that he has detached but with all the new rules and regulations
unncgh cmon cmon they cant get decent staff any more
they tend to turn a blind eye
as long as im careful
he hands sam a torch mind you if ever they could prove id been working on their equipment
well thats a different matter
up a bit with the torch sir
wouldnt it be easier just to work for central services
couldnt stand the pa ah were getting warm the pace
the paperwork couldnt stand the paperwork
indicating the torch over to the left please if you dont mind sir
hold it there
yes theres more bits of paper in central services than bits of pipe read this fill in that hand in the other listen this old system of yours could be
on fire and i couldnt even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a b
mildly well i suppose one has to expect a certain amount why
i came into this game for adventure go anywhere travel light get in get out wherever theres trouble a man alone
now theyve got the whole country sectioned of and you cant move without a form
im the last of a breed
he holds up a small charred gadget theres your problem
can you fix it
but i can bypass it with one of these he pulls another gadget from his bag
the door bell
tuttle grabs for his gun
are you expecting anyone
he goes out closing the immediate door and goes to the front door which he opens
he is confronted by two officious little men in boiler suits who are standing outside his door
their names are spoor and dowser
dowser is spoors echo
you telephone sir
trouble with your air conditioning
gulps no not at all
i mean its all right
they dont like that
i mean it fixed itself
machines dont fix themselves
hes tampered with it dowser
with it spoor
look im sorry about your wasted journey sam tries to close the door but spoor prevents this
to dowser i think wed better have a look
have a look
no you cant
he is pushed aside
spoor followed by dowser heads for the door behind which is mr tuttle
sam is paralysed
spoor approaches the door as if it is dangerous
he turns the handle quietly and gives the door a little nudge
the door begins to swing slowly open
sam suddenly finds inspiration
just a minute
spoor and dowser turn round as the door continues to swing open
when the door is open behind their backs tuttle is seen holding his pistol in a two handed grip his knees slightly bent
tuttle freezes like that pointing his pistol through the open door
have you got a b
dowser looks very angry
veins stand out on his forehead and he goes into what looks like some sort of fit
spoor knocks him to the ground
to sam now look what youve done to him
have you got one or havent you
dowser moans and begins to get back on his feet
but we can get one
worried about dowser its all right terry its all right everythings all right
ushering them to the door im sorry but im a bit of a stickler for paper work
where would we be if we didnt follow the correct procedures
well be back
closing the door on them thank you
sam turns back to tuttle who is coming forward pocketing his gun
thanks lowry youre a good man in a tight corner
tuttle returns to work fitting in the new by pass gadget and tightening the nuts and happily humming brazil
i dont want to get involved in any of this
but i work at the ministry of information and i happen to know that information retrieval have been looking for an archibald tuttle heating engineer
you wouldnt by any chance be pleased my friends call me harry
information retrieval eh
what do they want you or
time to go
tuttle finishes the job and throws his tools into the bag
thank you very much
how much will it
on the house
you did me a favor
check the corridor
sam goes to the front door opens it and looks out
tuttle slips out and heads off down the balcony corridor
hey thats a dead end
but tuttle merely undoes a pre arranged rope and swings tarzan like off the end of the balcony and across a multi story void to a neighboring block
sam is amazed not to say stunned
sam is at his desk among all the desks
documents are being delivered right left and centre through the vacuum tubes
all the clerks are busy
the screens are devoted to their proper use
all this activity is explained by the fact the mr kurtzmans door is wide open
at the next desk is another clerk much like sam his neighbour
i think kurtzman getting is suspicious
what have we got on today
kurtzman appears in his doorway
calls out mr lowry
would you step in here a moment please
we go with kurtzman as he closes the office door behind him we are now in
kurtzman is pacing anxiously
sam walks into the office
during the brief opening and closing of the door we just manage to hear the piano player in casablanca singing
a kiss is just a kiss
kurtzman is too worried to notice
he is holding a piece of paper gingerly as if it were contagious
he waves it frantically as sam enters
hysterically thank god youre here
were in terrible trouble
look at this
look at this
he thrusts the piece of paper at sam
taking the paper a cheque
the refund for tuttle
i mean buttle
its been confusion from the word go
hes been wrongly charged for electromemorytherapy and someone somewhere is trying to make us carry the can
ive never seen a ministry cheque before
weve got to get rid of it
theres been a balls up somewhere and when the music stops theyll jump on whoevers holding the cheque
send it to somebody else
send it to buttle
its his cheque
ive tried that
population census have got him down as dormanted the central collective storehouse computer has got him down as deleted and the information retrieval have got him down as inoperative
security has him down as excised
admin have him down as completed hang on
sam sits down at the console and punches keys
he does this very efficiently muttering to himself and generally demonstrating an expertise which obviously leaves kurtzman way out of his depth until he is dead
well never get rid of the damned thing
what are we going to do
try next of kin
a revelation next of kin
sam punches more keys
there we go
whats the number on the cheque
reading it sam has been efficiently punching this in
central banking buttle veronica
deposit sam rips off a print out rapidly stuffs it and the cheque into a cannister and then into a vacuum tube
a job well done
fervently please dont come back
please dont come back
unfortunately kurtzmans prayers are not answered and the
vacuum tube returns almost immediately
sam opens it up
from the computer screen comes a voice play it again sam sam and kurtzman look at the screen
we get a quick glimpse of humphrey bogart before the screen reverts to numbers
she doesnt have a bank account
hysterically well thats it
i may as well go and hang myself
this sort of thing couldnt have happened before the stupid seventh tier reorganization
that was simmons doing
and he and jeffries always sit together at lunch
he thumps his hand hard on the desk top ow
he picks up the offending cheque perhaps we can lose it
behind the filing cabinet
or destroy it
under this tirade sam has begun to hum brazil not entirely sure what inspired him
youd never get away with it
besides you cant do that to somebodys refund
there is one more option
not really believing it what
drive out to mrs buttle give her the cheque tell her to sign her name on the back cash it at the corner sweet shop
kurtzman is dumbfounded by the audacity of this
sam takes over
in no time at all he has battered away at the keyboard slammed a cannister into a vacuum tube and received almost immediately a cannister containing a sheaf of different
ill do it for you
authorise the cheque
whats the address
kurtzman scribbles it down for him
what do i do next
call the motor pool and authorise personal transport
of course of course
leave it to me
how do i authorize a cheque
separating the and blue sheets here we are
pink and blue receipts
all youve got to do is sign these and the back of the cheque
kurtzman takes out his pen and tries to sign the papers but his hand is giving him trouble
exhausted after all the emotion oh god
i think ive broken a bone
what a pathetic thing i am
taking the pen from him here
sam signs the cheque and receipts
a big close up shows that he is scribbling kurtzmans signature
sam pockets the papers and the pen
you are good to me sam
leaving dont mention it
see you later
cut to sam at the wheel of the little car beetling along in a seemingly endless tube like tunnel menaced fore and aft by huge buses lorries and other carriers
which literally lift the little three wheeler from the road surface and shake it by the scruff of its tiny neck
cut to sam in interior of the messerschmidt
he is singing along to an obscure arrangement of brazil
plays music for a moment which then fades out we interrupt this programme to bring you news of a terrorist bombing at the
sam switches off cut to exterior view of messerschmidt still merrily progressing in arterial tunnel
cut to very tiny exit sign exit
cut to sam peering at sign
cut to messerschmidt taking the exit just as a huge lorry roars by
beautiful utopian block of high rise flats gleam in the sunlight
pulling back we reveal it to be an architects model in a protective perspex case standing in the centre of a decorative fountain that has long ceased to work graffiti
and junk are now the only decorations
in the background is the grim reality of the massive housing tower
sams messerschmidt is just puling up in the shadow of the building which is grey decrepid vandalised
huge conduits pipes and tubing frame the scene
sam gets out of the car under the cool and none too friendly gaze of a few locals
self consciously sam looks around him then at the paper in his hand
a little group of kids sit pitching pennies against a wall
sam goes over to them
super polite excuse me
can you tell me
but before he can finish the smallest tiny kid looks up
sam uncomfortably effs off
he is watched at some distance imapassively by the little girl butttle
as sam enters the buildings one of the kids gets out a can of something and approaches the car
another is fiddling with a box of matches
cut to sam hesitantly walking into the semi derelict lobby of the big block of flats
graffiti vandalism are in evidence everywhere
he walks up to the lift
pushes the button
he pushes again
this time the lift door shudders and sparks
sam tries to pull the doors apart
they jam open with a three inch gap between them still shuddering and grinding
in the sparking light sam can make out an interior crammed with garbage junk old furniture dead cats
resignedly he turns towards the stairs
cut to sam coming breathlessly out of the stairwell
on the wall next to it is the number
walking down the corridor he looks at the number and starts to knock but then notices that the door is cracked open
sam tries to knock on the door but it keeps edging open and he settles for knocking on the door frame a bit feebly
mrs buttle silence uh mrs buttle
silence sam stands not knowing what to do
sam pushes the door a bit more open gingerly and puts about per cent of his body into the hall of the flat
cut to sams pov of darkish hall
cut to sam entering extremely tacky sitting room shrouded in half darkness
this is the same flat from which the father was taken at the beginning of the film the hole is still in the ceiling
sam becomes aware of a woman sitting absolutely still at a small table by the only still broken window in the room
are you mrs buttle
the woman nods very slightly without looking at him
my name is lowry sam lowry
im from the ministry of information
no response ive come to give you a cheque
sam takes the cheque out of his pocket and puts it on the table to tempt mrs buttle into a flicker of interest but she fails to notice it or
him for that matter
sam pushes the cheque a little way towards mrs buttle but she does not respond
indicting cheque its a refund
im afraid there was a mistake
not my department
im only records
it seems that mr buttle was overcharged by information retrieval
i dont think they usually make mistakes
i suppose were all human
sam looks around and sees the hole in the ceiling
what happened to the
he gets nothing back
actually my bringing this here is rather unorthodox
usually any payments are made through the central computer
there were certain difficulties and rather than cause delay we thought you might appreciate this now
it being christmas
my husbands dead isnt he
i assure you mrs buttle the ministry is always very scrupulous about following up and eradicating error
if you have any complaints which youd like to make id be more than happy to send you the appropriate forms
what have you done with his body
mrs buttle starts to cry
look im very sorry but im afraid i dont know anything about it
im really just delivering the cheque
if you wouldnt mind signing these receipts producing blue and pink receipts ill go and leave you in peace
sam picks up the cheque and gives it to mrs buttle together with the receipts
mrs buttle tears them up and throws them in his face
he hadnt done anything
he was good
what have you done with his body
sam looks around for an escape and sees a young buttle standing in the doorway
the boy is looking at him with a blank tearful face
suddenly the boy launches himself at sam with terrible ferocity
sam is knocked against the wall
a mirror falls off the wall and smashes on the floor
the boy is all over sam kicking and pulling his hair
mrs buttles reaction however is to try and pull the boy away from sam
by the time she succeeds sam is on his hands and knees in pain
the boy is crying and shouting and mrs buttle is loudly trying to quieten the from sams pov a piece of broken mirror lying on the floor reflects the hole
in the ceiling
with jills head and shoulders framed in the hole
the moment is unreal for sam in his dazed condition
the vision seems unreal too
jill is staring at sam out of the piece of mirror and
shes very much the girl from his dream now
are you alright
mumbles its you
mrs buttle are you alright
sam grabs at the image i
at the mirror shifting the angle so that the vision disappears
he looks for the vision on the floor but cant find it
then he begins to realise the reality of what he has seen
he stands up dazed and battered
mrs buttle has been looking up at the ceiling
sam looks up at the ceiling but there is now only the empty space of the hole
mrs buttle is shouting
sam rushes out of the flat
sam looks both ways and heads for the stairs
sam runs up the stairs to the floor above and finds himself in he runs along the corridor but has omitted to count the doors downstairs and now doesnt know
which door to knock at
he rings the bell on what he hopes is the right door
the bell doesnt work
he bangs on the door
the door opens a crack
a malevolent eye looks at him
the door shuts firmly
sam rushes to the next door
sam bursts into jills flat
he sees the hole in the floor
the place looks derelict
he hears an explosion and looks out of a window to see his car in flames
jill is apparently retreating from it across the forecourt
she is carrying a suitcase and bundles
sam rushes down the stairs
sam charges out into the open air
jill has disappeared
the messerchmidt however is in flames
sam doesnt know which way to turn
spotting an old mattress lying by the building he grabs it and throws it over the car in an attempt to smother the flames
the group of children watch him silently
suddenly with a great roar jills lorry comes round the corner at speed
sam sees that jill is at the wheel
sam runs after the lorry
it was nothing to do with me
the lorry roars away
sam dashes back to his smoldering three wheeler
he flings himself into it and starts it up
he also roars away except that he doesnt move
all three wheels have been removed
he turns round in despair and sees the group of children regarding him expressionlessly
they include the little girl buttle
defeated he slumps down against his charred vehicle
a shadow passes across his face
looking up he sees girl buttle standing over him
her name is jill
getting up youre a very good little girl
what are you doing here
im waiting for my daddy
uncomprehending he will be pleased when he comes home
girl buttle doesnt answer and sam starts to walk away
after a few yards the thought strikes him he turns back to look at the little girl buttle who stands alone patiently in the vandalised wilderness
it is the end of the work day
the clerks are busily getting their coats and leaving the office
as the last one goes mr
kurtzman comes out of his private office with his hat and coat on
he turns out the office light
he sees sam isolated in the empty room still working at his computer console
totally absorbed in what he is doing
ive had the transport pool onto me
you dont know anything about a personnel transporter gone missing do you
sam doesnt seem to hear him
on the computer screen is a front and side view picture of jill
her name and code number is at the top of the screen
sam is punching up personal dossier information like age height weight colour of hair colour of eyes distinguishing marks etc
preoccupied a personnel transporter
theyve got it wrong
i had a personal transporter
ill do the paperwork tomorrow sam punches up a few more categories for jills dossier
is it all right about mrs buttles cheque
i delivered it
can i forget it
sam punches a few more buttons on the computer
what a relief
on reflection i shall probably have nightmares
at this point the word classified superimposes itself over most of the screen and irq starts agitating at the bottom damn
whats the matter
you dont happen to know how i can get around an irq do you
all information on rd level suspects is classified
i know that
all enquiries to information retrieval
which is hopeless of course
they never tell you anything
but come the time they want something from us
throughout this verbal wallpaper sam has been punching keys cancelling the classified overprint
he then punches in the code for a hard copy print out
jills two view computer portrait rolls out as sam ponders his options
cutting off kurtzman ive go to accept that promotion to get behind this havent i
realising what hes suggesting no
youve only just turned it down
thinking sam is joking i never signed the form
i did it for you
its what you wanted isnt it
i dont know
kurtzman picks up jills print out and glances at it
he grimaces and drops it back on the desk with a shudder
come on before they turn the lights out
he turns off the machine
he stands up and follows kurtzman towards the door
the door is some distance away and before they get there all the lights go out
kurtzman bumps into a desk and curses
packed tightly between other passengers sam is busy drawing long flowing hair with a pencil on the computer print out of jill turning her into the dream girl
the transport cage rattles through its elevated tube towards a tower block
the transport cage arrives at the platform forming the end of sams corridor
passengers disembark and head for various doors along the corridor
sam almost fails to get off in time so concentrated on jills picture is he
looking as if hes trying to make up his mind about something he heads for his own front door
the place is in a state of turmoil
servicing panels are off the walls
conduit ducting pipes unknown mechanical horrors spew from the wall as if the place was disemboweled
spoor stands in the middle of it all trying to direct two other workmen who are poring over wiring plans which seem to make little sense to them
dowser is not visible but there is a great deal of clunking and banging going on somewhere behind the wall
how did you
muffled ergency procedures
angrily i havent got an emergency
get out of here
for reply spoor whips a small tape recorder out of his bag and plays back sams original phone call to central services claiming an emergency
spoor shuts off his machine puts back into his bag and comes out with what looks like a quite thin phone hook with carbon paper between each page
spoor indicates the bottom of page
sign here please
what is it
surprised its a b what did you think it was
sam takes out kurtzmans old fashioned fountain pen from his pocket signs where indicated
spoor registers that sams signature has hardly penetrated through he first carbon let alone the other sourly havent you got a ballpoint
sam resignedly starts signing all the other pages one by one
spoor realises that dowsers echo has gone missing
now wheres he got to
dowser bursts through a panel in the wall
this is the panel which tuttle had removed and replaced
a few of the flats intestines have come out with dowser
dowser has made a find tuttles spare part
what have you got there
highly excited got there
dowser points to tuttles spare part which is hanging out of the wall attached to rubber tube
spoor examines this closely
sam watches alarmed
the two men go into a mumbling huddle
to sam youve had that scab tuttle here havent you
who fixed your ducts
i fixed it myself
whered you get this from eh he holds up tuttles spare part out yer nostril
central services dont take kindly to sabotage
spoor and dowser and the other workmen gather up their tools put them in the bag grab everything else that belongs to them and are leaving
spoor grabs the form book out of sams hands rips out the last page thrusts that page at sam shoves the book into his bag
the workmen begin leaving the flat
wait a minute
you cant just go and leave it like this
mock innocent why not
all youve got to do is blow yer nose and fix it havent you
leaving youre putting your talents to very odd use mr lowry yes odd use to pit wits against central services sod you stupid twit
they go slamming the door behind hem leaving sam in the ruins of his flat
sam stands in the maimed sitting room
wall panels are off
tubes ducting wires etc
spill out into the room like greasy intestines
sam more or less collapses onto a couch
he stares at the ceiling
the room is gently hiccoughing and belching around him
he stares at the print out of jills face
slowly it dissolves into the dream girls face fills screen
the camera pulls back to reveal that she is separated from us by a tangled forest of conduit ducting like vines
sam is struggling through the vines which grab at him entwine and entangle him
finally bursting free he reaches out for the girl hovering before him but as he embraces her she dissolves in smoke and he plummet into a void beneath his feet
cut to sam plummeting down through dense clouds his cape twisting around him
somehow he manages to wrestle it clear of his body
gripping the corners he whips the cape up and over his head
the wind catches it and fills it out until it acts as a parachute slowing sams descent
suddenly the clouds thin out and sam can see below him
sam is heading down towards a barren landscape
strange mounds dot the barrenness they ooze smoke and the occasional flame
near one of the mounds are two long lines of shrouded figures being forced into two giant cages suspended beneath two great misshapen balloons
the black robed forces of darkness fod surround the prisoners relentlessly herding them towards the cages
the entire scene is strangely coloured by unearthly light
the sky is blood red and where the sun should be is a black disc
sam descends on his cape parachute
cut to prisoners in their grey shrouds shuffling towards the jaws of the brutal cages
they are defeated destroyed without hope
the fod prod and whip them forward
one of the fod raises his spear to force a stumbling prisoner to his feet but stops with the spear raised above his head
he has seen something
other fods turn to see what it is
cut to sam landing on the beach a short distance away
the prisoners stop and look up
we see their faces clearly for the first time
one of them is mrs buttle
others are people sam saw in the flats and the kids
sam recognises them
he is slightly taken aback
a look of determination crosses his face
he draws the sword
everyone is frozen in place
sam starts forward
but he is stopped by a violent tremor as the earth begins to tremble and shake
everyone looks terrified
with a mighty roar a crack opens up in the ground between sam and the others
brilliant rays of light shaft upwards from the opening
and then with a maniacal shriek the large black flapping thing shoots out of the crevasse and streaks high into the sky
sam hesitates and turns to look down into the light
there under several meters of the earths crust are fluffy white clouds darting about in a beautiful blue sky
sam is delighted but as he looks up he is frozen in his tracks by an enormous figure that straddles the crevasse
this terrifying creature stands over feet high
he is encased in a frightening concoction of ancient japanese armour which seems on closer examination to he made of computer parts
his face is hidden behind a horrific steel mask
it is the giant samurai warrior that was pushing the drawer closed in the storeroom of knowledge
in his hand is an evil looking spear
sam is unsure which way to turn
the grey prisoners are being loaded into the cages with more speed
he turns to face the giant warrior
as sam steps forward the giant stands ominously still
then very slowly he raises his spear in an almost religious gesture
as he does the light from the day is cut off
looking down sam sees that he crevasse has vanished as well
maniacal laughter from the flapping black thing makes sam look up to see the ballooned cage packed with grey prisoners rise up from the ground and begin to float away
escorted by the black flapping thing
sam rushes after it grabbing one of the trailing ropes
but as he is hoisted into the air it is severed by the fods
he tumbles to the ground
looking around he sees that for some reason the second ballooned cage is still tethered nearby
sam rushes over to it and begins chopping the tethers away
the cage bobbles ungainlily as sam cuts the last restraining rope
grabbing hold he is pulled upwards but before he can reach the cage something clutches his leg halting his progress
as he struggles his other leg is caught
he is being pulled back by two giant hands
looking down he can see that from the top of one of the smoking mounds a head and two giant arms protrude
the face looks like mr kurtzman
sam desperately clings on to the rope as he struggles with the restraining hands
its a trap
shes not what she seems
sam kicks and strains but the hands hold firm
sam wakes up
his feet are entangled in some wiring and ducting
he is still in his devastated sitting room
as he untangles himself the door bell rings
it takes a moment for sam to recognise it as the door bell
annoyed and still disturbed by the dream he gets up and goes to the door
he opens it
in bursts a girl dressed in a silly bell boy costume with lots of glitter net stockings and big bowed tap dancing shoes
she launches into a terrible song and dance routine
girl singing mrs ida lowry requests the pleasure of your companyyyy at her apartment tonight from eight thirtyyyy midnight to celebrate the completion of her recent cosmetic surgeryyyy the guest
of honour will be mr conrad helpmann dep
under minister of state for public information r
by singing telegram
sam and the girl stand looking at each other uneasily for a moment
its reply paid
he sings uncertainly thank you very much mother but actually you dont have to sing it
the girl begins to dance again but this time in a rather strange strangled fashion
he looks at his watch arent you a bit late
the party started half an hour ago
yes i know
its the backlog everybody complains
was it all right otherwise
yes it was
do you mind if i use your bathroom
sam rings the doorbell to his mothers flat
he is wearing
an unstylish tuxedo and bow tie obviously his only dress outfit
the door is opened by a liveried flunky whos about to speak when an attractive year old womans face appears over his shoulder and addresses sam over the threshold
sam im so glad you came
do come in
sam steps inside where the flunky proceeds to search him
the place is full of sleek people smartly but less formally dresses than sam
it is an elegant baroque room lavishly appointed but still violated by the ubiquitous central service ducts that thrust through antique tapestries and gilt mirrors with little regard for aesthetics
or the interior decorators feelings
is that you
taking his arm looking slightly askance at his clothes of course
isnt it wonderful
the bandages came of this afternoon
come and join the fun
is mr helpmann here
yes he is he wants to talk to you
i want to talk to him
sam pushes away the flunky who is by now passing a metal detector over him
it seems youre the first person ever to turn down a promotion
he thinks you should see a doctor
actually ive decided
dr jaffe hoves into view
you know sam
dr jaffe is no longer suave
he has been transformed by drink and success
mostly by drink
as high as a kite can you believe it
just me and my little knife
snip snip slice slice can you believe it
and this is just the beginning
chirst yes youve seen her with her clothes off
faces are a doddle compared to tits and arse
explains no hairline
primly really louis
a handsome young piece of beefcake delivers a drink to ive been looking everywhere for you ida
the beefcake takes mother away
ah dear boy
and what do you think of your mother now
voice off camera it will never last
sam and dr jaffe turn to see who is speaking
it is dr chapman a tall pipe smoking professional looking gent
a trifle haughtily excuse me dr chapman did you say something
ive tried it
a nice effect
but highly unstable
in six months shell look like grandma moses
sam wishing to escape from this bitchery turns away but suddenly freezes the reflection in the large wall mirror next to him is not that of the party guests but
of the grey prisoners in his dream they are massed in the room looking pleadingly towards him
unsuave again now see here chapman
at least mine dont look like theyve been mugged
through the grey prisoners pushes mrs terrain
sam turns around to see her pushing through the party guests
mrs terrain is limping and is even more heavily swathed in bandages than the last time
dr chapman hastily moves away as mrs terrain comes up
she claims sam taking his arm
looking at her worriedly whatever happened to you
there was a slight complication
chapman says it often happens with a delicate skin like mine
nothing to worry about
hes promised me ill have these bandages off in a
trying to disengage actually theres someone i want to meet
roguishly i know i know
she drags sam through the party and we arrive at her daughter shirley who is of course a wallflower
here we are
im going to leave you two lovebirds in peace
but he is alone with shirley standing at the entrance to his mothers embarrassingly rampant boudoir style bedroom
in amongst the diaphanous curtains enclosing the bed mother is playing hide and seek with a young stud
can i get you a drink shirley
shirley looks at him terrified
and my mother
they seem to have got the idea
i mean im terribly flattered of course but um the thing is i dont want you to be under any false
struggling into speech shyly its
i dont like you either
this isnt what sam expected
he smiles weakly at her
voice off camera sam
sam turns round to see jack lint a few paces away
you remember alison
he indicates his cute blonde perfect junior executives hello alison
you look different
well im two years older
and shes been to dr
alison locks displeased
winking at sam she doesnt like me telling anyone but shes pleased as anything really
er i knew you looked different
remember how they used to stick out
oh yes vividly
i used to wonder if they were real
what my ears
jaffe has pinned her ears back
covering up hopelessly quite absolutely i always thought they were false
looking past sam mr helpmann
sam spins round and sees a very pleasant looking distinguished old man moving in their direction
he is in a wheelchair
you remember my wife
alis of course
barbara isnt it
how are you
conveying to alison that she mustnt object barbaras very well thank you sir
how are you
fine thank you
ida said you might be here
have you got a minute
to jack would you excuse us
jack is taken aback envious and eager to please
come on alison barbara jack propels his wife away
helpmann i need your help sam
its the sort of bathroom you would expect of mother an adjunct to her boudoir
the pink or purple lavatory is in the process of flushing while sam holds mr helpmann vertical grasping him under the armpits while mr helpmann is zipping his fly
thanks very much sam
thats all right mr helpmann
glad to help
he is lowering helpmann into the wheelchair
if i can help you
broaching the subject well i
in maneuvering helpmann sam clumsily knocks over one of the pretty pots which fussily decorate mothers bathroom shelf
a thin layer of powder is spread over the wash stand
your father and i were very close
of course jeremiah was senior to me but we were close friends
especially after the bombing he indicates his legs and i chuckles keep his name alive at the office every day
with his finger helpmann is tracing letters in the powdered surface
its as though hes there speaking to me ere i am j
the ghost in the machine
we see that helpmann has traced the letters ereiamjh in the powder
i know he would have wanted me to help you
and i promised your mother id take you onto the team at information retrieval
but i gather that
ive changed my mind
id like to accept the transfer am i too late
thats for me to say
helpmann puts out his hand
sam takes it
welcome to information retrieval
helpmann blows away the spilled powder and ereiamjh with it
scene deleted scene deleted cut to wide shot of massive imposing lobby much like the records lobby but this one is very austere
not even the ever present security checks
and a bit unnerving
framed in the doorway is a lone tiny figure
cut to close up
he hesitates and then enters
cut to video screen
the video camera follows sam across the lobby til he stops in tight profile at reception desk
we tilt up revealing sam standing facing us just beyond the monitor which is on the desk
diffidently to the porter my name is sam lowry
i have to report to mr warren
looking down his nose at sams unsleek clerks suit and then handing him an i
badge thirtieth floor sir
er dont you want to search me
reaching into his pocket my i
no need sir nonplussed but i could be anybody
no you couldnt sir
this is information retrieval
indicating to the right the lifts arrived sir
sam steps out of the lift
the lift doors close
sam looks up and down the corridor hearing nothing
then he and we begin to hear a sound
it is a curious whirring murmuring tummeling sound and it seems to be growing closer
suddenly a scrum of people swings into view around a corner at the far end of the rather long corridor
at the centre of the scrum is a tall man with a magisterial expression and an air of eternal bustle
this is mr warren
he is surrounded by the expediters who are competing for his attention with bits of paper and bits of sentences
mr warren is snapping out decisions
satisfied expediters drop out of the scrum at intervals disappearing one at a time through one of the many doors which line both sides of the corridor
the scrum doesnt get any smaller because new expediters dart out of other doors and join the milling mob
the whole circus is coming by sam at the rate of knots
the sound it makes breaks down into something like this
waving pager mr warren this order
waving same mr warren
ditto about this invoice
victims list dealing on all sides yes
send that back
of course not
cut to sam watching this caravanserai with awe as it starts pass him
about these requisitions
ex has suspects still outstanding
a decision mr warren
put half as terrorists the rest as victims yes
sam doesnt have the nerve to jump into this
the scrum sweeps by and fades away along the corridor and finally disappearing around the corner at the other end
silence has descended again
sam gets to the corner of the corridor and finds a similar corridor at right angles
he hesitates and continues
then he starts to hear the sound again
it is coming up from behind
mr warren has circumnavigated the building
the same sort of business is being enacted at the same pace
as the scrum reaches sam he gathers his nerve and jumps right in beside warren and keeps going
in a hurry im lowry mr warren
putting arm around sam ah
still dealing with expediters no cancel that
glad to have you aboard
dont be ridiculous jenkins
yes yes yes
youll like it up here
send that back
weve got a crack team of
are they kidding
no in triplicate im expecting big things
two copies to finance
send that to security
uh uh uh
poring over forms uh dont let progress see this
between you and me lowry this
tell records to get stuffed
is about to be upgraded and
warren suddenly pivots around swinging sam degrees in the direction they came from plus a bit
ah here we are
they are standing facing a door one of the hundreds of identical doors lining these corridors what do you think
the door says officer dz
sam has no idea what he ought to say
solemnly your very own number
on your very own door
and behind that door he turns the knob and opens the door your very own office
congratulations dz welcome to the team
warren whirls off in a flurry of paperwork and expediters leaving sam standing dumfounded at the entrance to his office
cut to sams pov of the office
it is about four feet wide
a small blacked out window high on the far wall is bisected by what looks like a recently constructed side wall
the room is bare except for a chair and a desk which is also bisected by the new wall
pneumatic tubes hang from the ceiling
sam slowly enters the room
sam looks lost
he doesnt know where to begin because theres nothing to begin with
he squeezes in behind his desk and for want of anything else to do starts arranging his in and out baskets
there in his in basket is one of the ubiquitous executive toys gaily wrapped with a card from helpmann merry xmas welcome
sam cant quite believe
he returns to lining up his pencils placing a couple of bocks phone books against the wall on the left extreme of his desk
sam turns his attention away from the books when suddenly they both fall over with a plop
puzzled he stands the books up again turns his eyes away and plop
intrigued a bit exasperated sam carefully and before his very eyes the desk begins to disappear into the wall and plop the books topple over
puzzled sam grabs hold of the desk and begins to try to pull it back through the wall
the desk moves back an inch or so but then stops somehow held stubbornly
sam grits his teeth reallllly pulls grimacing a bit but the desk wont budge
intrigued sam gets up goes around his desk and heads for the door
cut to sam coming out of his office turning right and walking to the next door the nameplate of which reads as is his custom sam opens the door without
limes office day a cut to sams pov
here is an office much like his
its the other half of his room bisected by the partition wall
the other half of his desk is occupied by a slimy looking round headed little junior executive wholly occupied with trying to drag a bit more of the desk into
he is unaware of sam
lime startled lets go of his desk and vents his irritation on sam whom he mistakes for someone else
no you cant have any more chairs
theres only one left in here now and i need that to sit on
realizing his mistake oh
who are you
becoming unctuous ah yes youre the new boy from next door ha ha
he advances toward sam with hand out to shake
shaking hands my names lime
welcome to expediting
he pauses looking around would you mind if i borrowed your computer console
ill bring it back in ten minutes
you want to take my console into your office
after a moments consideration ill tell you what
you tell me what and ill do it for
im a bit of a whizz on this thing
indicates computer console sam hesitates but sees that theres no other way
taking print out on jill from his pocket alright
theres someone i want to check out
a woman called gillian layton
leering a woman eh
trying to ignore this i know her age and distinguishing marks
but i need an address or a place of work or something continuing to leer this is your dream girl is it
taken aback what
recovering look let me use the console for a few minutes
trying to be jocular you must be joking entirely unconvincing when theres a woman involved theres no stopping me
now let me have that sheet
he takes jills print out sheet from sam and begins to punch the keys laboriously with one finger
sod it its broken
you havent switched it on
look youre putting me off standing there
go back to your office and ill give you a knock when ive finished
sam hesitates but goes
im not going to elope with her
sam is sitting in his office listening to the protracted one finger exercise which is going on next door
he stares dumbly at the shining absolutely useless executive toy
the camera skims along over an icy sea
this is sams pov as he wings his way over the water with his new gleaming wings
in the distance rises a strange massive ship
as he gets closer we can see that the snip is listing heavily to one side
in fact it is barely afloat
closer still it becomes apparent that the ship is made of stone
dark evil grey blocks of granite form not only the hull but the super structures and smokestacks
it looks like a massive medieval fortress gone to sea
the screen is engulfed in stone
the camera heads up the side of the ship
higher and higher we climb past course after course of mammoth stones
reaching the first deck we continue upwards
there appears to be no entrance
sam is looking frustrated and angry
but then he spots an opening
a few stones have come loose one of them juts out forming a ledge
as the cage passes sam jumps and managed to gain a foothold on the outcropping
squeezing thru the gap in the rocks he makes his way thru a dark passage
emerging from the opening he finds himself teetering over an enormous abyss formed by the outer hull and the inner stone core of the ship
great stone ribs curve downwards thru the darkness broken only by narrow shafts of brilliant light streaming from occasional cracks and fissures in the stone core
for a brief moment sam gets a glimpse of blue sky thru one of the openings but his attention is distracted by a distant moan
huddled far below him at the bottom of the dark abyss are hundreds of grey shrouded prisoners
their moan blends with the creaks and groans of the stones as the ship slowly wallows back and forth
suddenly a great boom resounds throughout the ship
sam is unsure where it comes from
and then another boom reverberates about him
he has to steady himself as the ship quivers from the noise
he clutches at the wall
sams head is leaning against the wall of his office
the boom repeats
lime is knocking on the other side
sam leaps up
as he leaves his office he looks back to see the desk creep through to limes office a little bit more
lime is standing proudly holding out a sheet of paper
computers are my forte
reading gillian layton age twenty three eyes blue hair black weight one hundred and twenty one pounds distinguishing marks blemish on right shoulder scar on left elbow he stops having
come to the end
he looks at the other side of the paper but theres nothing there
is this all you got
its a start isnt it
disbelieving but i already knew this
best to take it slowly where some women are concerned
sam sits on limes chair and deftly punches the computer keys
hey thats my desk
working quickly gillian layton suspect s
all enquiries reference officer l room
switching off the machine and getting up thats what i wanted to know
thank you very much
sam heads off down corridor
ah lowry glad i caught you
he continues to deal with expediters in between dealing with sam no send it back for
are you settling down
i want this order rescinded
theres a query on a personnel transporter you took out from the pool
tell them no tell them yes
or was it a personnel carrier you took out from transportation
send that up to security
some kind of eight wheel half track was it
tell him i want to see him
send round the paperwork lowry
arrange a conference on that one
anyway tidy it up lowry theres a good chap get a new suit
did you want the lift
the cavalcade is passing the lifts
sam backs away into the open lift
the cavalcade passes on out of sight
the lift contains a charlady with a bucket and mop
she remains in the lift as sam joins her
sam presses the button for the th floor
the lift doors close on him and the charlady
from somewhere far away there is the groaning shriek of a man in pain
sam glances around the lift
there appears to be an air conditioning vent in the ceiling
sam glances enquiringly at the charlady who merely smiles at him
another scream is heard
the charlady smiles again
doesnt that disturb you
the charlady fiddles with something in her ears and pulls out a pair of wax earplugs
beg your pardon
the lift arrives
the lift arrives
sam steps out
the charlady remains in the lift
the doors close
sam heads down surgically clean white tiled corridor
passing a white coated technician monitoring what appears to be electric meters sam comes to a door with
above the door a red light is glowing
the red light goes out and a green light comes on
room l day inside there is a connecting door to he next door room but the only person in the immediate room is a pleasant looking female typist wearing headphones
chewing gum and typing with great facility
sam approaches the typist who busily typing twinkles a greeting mimed and silently mouths the words
it wont be long now
she carries on typing sam nods and stands quietly by her
he can hear tiny sounds coming through her headphones
he looks down at the piece of paper in the typewriter
he reacts a bit strangely perhaps even winces
we see he close up of the words being struck crisply on paper
ahhhh oh god
i cant stand quietly still typing can i help you
she is looking at sam helpfully holding one of the earphones away from her ear
from this earphone we can just hear quietly
oh god no
no stop i dont know
im looking for officer l
the typist nods smiling
she puts back the earphone and carries on typing
im sure he wont be long now
she types a little more but suddenly stops
i thought so
she takes off the earphones and takes the paper and carbonums out of her typewriter and starts collating all the different copies
through the frosted glass door leading into the next area sam can see a figure come through a double door and turn left making a silly hi sign to the
typist as he exits from sight
she is charmed
almost immediately after them a white coated technician exits but to the left
you can go in now
sam goes through the glass door and is about to push open the double doors in front of him
he is halted by a noise from the typist she indicates that he is to go to the left
he does so and enters an office
an antique desk with a large collection of executive toys and other tastefully reassuring furniture fill the room which is a rather oddly shaped
distorted as it by the curved wall of the much larger room that sam was stopped from entering
nevertheless the feel of the room is confidently successful
a buzzing noise draws sams attention to the wash basin in the far corner
the information retrieval technician is standing by a sink massing his temples with old fashioned scalp vibrators
his back to us
are you officer l
the technician makes no sign of having heard this
he continues vibrating his temples
a bit louder er excuse me
getting no response sam walks over to the technician
as he passes the desk he notices a strange mask lying face down on the desk top
it seems strangely familiar but as it is a negative concave image sam isnt sure
he continues over to the technician
louder excuse me
he touches the technician on the shoulder who jumps with a start
he spins around and turns out to be none other than jack lint
he is amazed to see sam
recovering slightly sam
what a surprise
even more surprised are you officer l
jack looks confused
he pauses and then removes ear plugs
shaking sams hand sorry about that
mr helpmann told me you were coming aboard congratulations
are you officer l
for my sins
are you settling in alright
im really glad you dropped by
unfortunately i dont have any time right now ive got a queue of customers to deal with er why dont we have a drink tonight
i dont want to take up your time now but i was hoping you could give me some information on somebody
its a security level three matter and information retrieval records says to refer to you
come back this afternoon about four oclock
if you give me the number of the case ill have the dossier here waiting
he pulls card from his pocket pushes it towards sam my tailor
well worth the investment
taking print out sheets from his pocket ive got numbers all over these im not sure which is the one you want
looking at the print out picture of jill over sams shoulder layton
what is it
you clever bastard
i might have guessed
you only moved in today and youre already hot on the bloody trail
please sam were going to have to be open to each other on this one
if you make a reputation with this case itll be at my expense
how do you mean
how much do you know
enough though eh
getting sucked into this exchange not really no
jack goes over to the sink and turns on the taps full blast splashing the water noisily into the basin
lets not fence around
this is the situation
some idiot somewhere in the building some insect confused two of our clients b and t
b thats a
buttle isnt it
you do know it all
no no i dont
im just beginning honestly
sorry carry on
well your a
buttle has been confused with t an a
i mean its a joke
somebody should be shot for that
so b was pulled in by mistake
you got the wrong man
a little heated i did not get the wrong man
i got the right man
the wrong man was delivered to me as the right man
i accepted him on trust as the right man
was i wrong
anyway to add to the confusion he died on us
which had he been the right man he wouldnt have done
you killed him
annoyed sam there are very rigid parameters laid down to avoid that event but buttles heart condition did not appear on tuttles file
dont think im dismissing this business sam
ive lost a weeks sleep over it already
im sure you have there are some real bastards in this department who dont mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette but thank god there are the new
boys like me who want to maintain decent civilized standards of terrorist eradication
weve got the upper hand for the moment but theyre waiting for us to slip up and a little slip up like this is just the chance theyre looking for
what ive got to do now is pick up tuttle interrogate him at the same voltage as buttle to the same meter reading to the last penny and juggle the
books in electrical banking
what has tuttle done
we suspect him of freelance subversion
dumbly hes a freelance subversive
hes a compulsive heating engineer
a maverick ex central service repair man with a grudge against society
now fortunately were nearly out of the wood i think
at least we will be when i get this layton woman under arrest
jack turns off taps and goes behind screen
agitated whats she done
you didnt know as much about this business as you pretended to did you
but i wouldve found out anyway
playing the game tell me about layton
she witnessed the tuttle arrest the buttle arrest and since then shes been making wild allegations obviously trying to exploit the situation shes working for somebody and shes not working
jack comes from behind the screen with a look confirming just what sam fears and hands him a suit
sam begins to put the suit on
hesitantly but surely i mean perhaps she just happened to live above the buttles and
picking up photograph of wife and kids from his desk look after that suit eh
barbara chose it for me
er youre not going to keep calling her barbara are you
barbaras a perfectly good name isnt it
preferring to let his drop look about the layton woman maybe shes just trying to help the buttle family
hell not for any reason
baffled i dont follow you
out of kindness
utterly baffled kindness
whats the purpose behind this line of enquiry
deciding to abandon this line of country so what are you going to do about her
get her out of circulation ive put her on the detention list
thinking fast you mean youre going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department
taken aback well i
what do you suggest
let me try to get to her
ill deactivate her
what does that mean
i dont want to be involved in anything unsavoury
you do trust me dont you
we went to school together
youre my oldest friend
and youre mine
youre the only person i can trust
then wed better keep this business just between the two of us
just between as and the security forces
they werent at school with us
but ive already put her on the search and detain list
take her off the list
theres no procedure for that until shes been arrested
say it was a mistake
we dont make mistakes
well id better get out there and try to get to her before security does
let me borrow her dossier for a while
for christs sake dont lose it
here youd better sign for it
jack presents sam with something to sign
he then gives him the dossier
ill be in touch
do you know what youre doing
about to say no then pauses trust me
admiring sams new look sam
were proud to have you at information retrieval
he hands sam another executive package sam steps out of room newly suited with old suit over arm
two guards are guiding a baggee down the corridor ahead of him
suddenly the baggee breaks away from his guards and begins to cannonball down the corridor directly at sam
sam is flattened against the wall as the baggee rockets by
cut to guards strolling past sam
cut to baggee running full tilt to the end of the corridor smashing into the wall bouncing back getting up now cross ways in the corridor bouncing off that wall
then the wall behind him then
slightly unnerved sam gets in the lift pushes the button for his floor the th and immediately begins perusing jills dossier
the lift descends
but unnoticed by sam continued past his floor without stopping
it stops at the lobby mezzanine
sam looks up and realizes he is on the wrong floor
angrily he pushes the correct floor number but before the doors close he hears an angry womans voice echoing through the massive lobby
he looks in the direction of the porters desk
there stands jill arguing with the porter
but youve stamped this form before
why wont you stamp it now
youve just said yourself miss weve already stamped it
why should we stamp it twice
sam is frozen
he cant believe what he sees
the lift doors close
sam is too slow to stop them
madly he pushes the buttons to no effect
the lift descends
at this point we had better describe the lift
it is a cross between the old metal grille lifts with accordion grille doors and the super sleek modern lifts that rise and fall in glass tubes so that one
can have panoramic views of dramatic architectural spaces such as the lobbies of the ministry
sam can see jill and if jill were to look up she could see sam descending
he is shouting and rattling the bars of the lift cage but no sound escapes to catch her attention
sam sinks below the floor of the lobby desperately trying to stop the demon lift
from his pov we see jill disappearing from view still arguing with the porter
the lift comes to rest
sam is still trying to get it to respond and return him to the lobby
two technicians are waiting as the doors open
from sams pov he sees them hang a sign on the door and walk away
he bangs the buttons for another moment with no result
he looks out of the lift and is able to read the sign lift out of order
frantically he looks around for another lift
all the others are on distant floors then he spots one off to one side its doors standing open
rushing over to it he leaps inside and reaches to push the floor number but there are no numbers on the buttons only letters
before he can sort this out a voice shouts at him
hey you get out of there
a guard approaches looking tough and mean
what do you think youre doing
thats the deputy ministers lift
sorry im in a hurry
hold on sonny
lets see your sam fumbles through his pockets desperate to get back to the lobby before jill leaves
he has forgotten he is wearing his new i
the guard cant see it because jills dossier is covering it
its here somewhere
my names lowry sam lowry expediting cant this wait
getting out book of forms im going to have to file a report on this
what date is it today
sam gives up trying to find his i
frantic sorry itll have to wait
he runs off dropping suit towards some stairs he has spotted
he starts to run after sam
two other guards also give chase
stairs day a sam scrambles up the stairs
guards in pursuit
the original guard rushes over to a guard desk and inserts key into cover of what is clearly an alarm button
sam still running
jill is still arguing with porter
sweetly youre a stupid fat arsed obstructive fascist moron arent you
if you say so
you think these are tits dont you
i bet youd like to touch them
youre looking at twenty pounds of high explosive
and if you dont stamp this form im going to blow the place up
jill thumps the desk with her fist
the guard throws the alarm switch
alarm bells start ringing and from secret doors heavily armed guards leap out their guns trained on jill as she appears to be the only person around
shouting jill has only the form in her hand which she dutifully drops
she is terrified by the suddenness and size of the response to her hitting the desk
the guards close in
sam rushes out of the door leading to the stairs
he cant believe the sight that greets him
he responds instinctively stop
let her go
he rushes over to the porters desk just as the guards behind him come through the door
he doesnt have a clue what he is going to do but as he reaches the group of guards they snap attention
confused he looks around and then realizes his i
badge is on his lapel and the guards are responding as trained
the guards chasing him screech to a halt when they see the others snapping to attention
everyone looks confused embarrassed hesitant to make the next move
sam breaks the silence
excellent work quick thinking
ill take charge of her now
realising he has jills dossier he shows it to everyone her print out pictures are on the front page
its a classified matter
ill include your fine handling of the situation in my report sam is suddenly aware he is still holding the executive toy present he hands it to the porter
grabbing jill come with me please
he hustles her towards the door
sam marches jill out of the main door and down the front steps of the information retrieval building
as he struggles with her some of the papers in the dossier slip out unbeknownst to sam and leave a trail of litter behind them
who are you
dont look back
how can i act naturally when youve trying to break my arm
cut to the pov of the ministry of information front door guards
they are looking down the steps at the retreating backs of sam and jill who are jostling each other
the guards see jill elbow sam in the ribs
come back here
he turns around knowing that the game is up
but instead of one of the guards shouting its an old lady angrily glaring at him and pointing to a keep your city tidy sign above a litter bin
screaming cant you read english
you illiterate foreign pig
you come here from your own filthy country and think you can mess our streets up
you should be fried alive you dirty verminous
sam sees the trail of dossier litter blowing about the pavement
he lets go of jill for a moment to grab at the papers
the lady continues screaming at him her little pekinese dog who incidentally wears a plaster over his bum hole yaps at his ankles ripping sams new trousers
sam is torn between trying to regain the pages of the dossier and following jill who has disappeared round the corner
he gives up retrieving the paper and rushes after cutting back to the two guards who have been observing all this bizarre activity we see one of them reading one
of the pieces of paper
hey you shouldnt be reading that its classified
jill is behind the steering wheel of her lorry which is just starting to move off
sam frantically runs towards the lorry leaps on the running board and pulls himself up into the cab
climbing in well done thats it
sam looks up and down his side of the street anxiously before realizing that jill has switched off the engine and is sitting glaring at him
they are stopped right in front of the ministry building
frantic what are you doing
for christs sake
who are you
desperately sam pulls roller blind down over window
hurriedly sam lowry
this sounds insane i know but ive been dreaming about you
even before i saw you you were in my dreams
weird isnt it
i mean i dont know what it means
but it might mean something
i hope so
anyway youre in danger and i think we should get out of here now quick
still jill does nothing
sam pulls down roller blind over
desperate bloody hell
do as i say
hard icy cool no
beginning to lose his bottle please
jill continues to sit glaring
sam delves into his pockets and drags out a handful of i
cards and papers most of which fall onto the floor
he then remembers that the badge hes looking for is pinned to his jacket
he thrusts it forward at jill
beside himself with panic alright
im information retrieval officer he checks the number somewhere
on the badge
dz and im arresting you for your own good
now start up and get moving before i hand you back to them
i dont know
just get going
jill starts up and moves off very cool in her own time
by now sam has got the shakes
indicting the papers that sam has dropped dont litter my cab
picking them up oh sorry
a high shot of the lorry moving through the city among traffic
jill is preoccupied with driving
she is smoking a cigarette
sam occasionally glances at her
this is amazing
being here with you
i mean in my dreams you
i dont want to hear about your fucking dreams
look im sorry i shouted at you
mainly to herself why are they all pigs at information retrieval
i dont know
realizing that this includes him hey thats not a very nice thing to say
jill blows smoke in sams direction
waving the smoke away you know smokings bad for you
its my fucking life
winding down the window yes of course
lighting up another cigarette i know you
i saw you through the floor didnt i
why did you run away
i didnt run away
i left the flat
i didnt like it
it had a hole in the floor
where are we going
where are you taking me
where are you taking me
it looks as if youre taking me
it does doesnt it
slightly worried where are you taking me
we pull back and lift off to see that the beautiful countryside through which weve been travelling is in fact a solid wall of giant bill boards advertising all sorts
of wonders like pine scented lavatory paper sea spray flavored cigarettes you name it these advertisements form an unbroken corridor down which the road travels
from a birds eye pov we see that the land behind the hoardings is blasted and blighted with garbage etc
the power plant is an extensive brutal dantes inferno of a landscape made mainly of steel
towers chimneys huge pipes buildings which look like bomb shelters
it is still daylight but the whole scene is murky and forbidding because of the swirling steam and smoke
in the murk can be seen sinister looking figures in protective clothing and hard hats
this is the world which is now entered by jills lorry
the lorry halts at a despatching hut near the crane and jill jumps down from the cab
sam stays inside looking around
something catches his eye
cut to facade of house
window boxes with flowers and shrubbery surrounded by a white picket fence provide domestic charm however in the doorway stands a man with protective clothing and something like a gas
mask over his face
he is waving to someone
slowly the house rises out of frame
in a wider shot we can see the house is suspended from and a giant crane that swings it through the air air filled with stead smoke evil smelling fumes
it is lowered onto the back of a lorry and we can see that the house is one of many prefabricated houses used in the construction of the power plant
sam watches jill walk away from the lorry and enter the despatchers hut
he looks around uneasily and then he start examining the inside of the lorry and opens a compartment which seems to be full of maps rags etc
he gets grease on sleeve of his suit
in the space behind the seats he finds the pieces of luggage which jill had carried away from the flat
he starts to examine this cautiously and is startled by the sudden opening of the cab door
dont act guilty
act like me
im just getting on with my job
or are you just getting on with yours
jill gets into the cab and closes the door and drives to a forward looking position
whats going on here
what does it look like
im collecting empties
the lorry stops and jill gets out
from sams p
the house suspended from the crane starts moving through the sky towards the lorry
he glances back to see jill slip a package out from behind the seat
she glances surreptitiously over her shoulder and slipping the parcel inside her jacket she walks away
sam climbs down from the cab trying to keep an eye on jill
he ends up standing next to a rusty kodak photospot standard
the picture on it though faded by pollution is of the beautiful valley that has now been replaced by the murk and mess of the power plant
jill has made her way over to a rather shadowy figure lurking around the corner of one of the metal structures
they appear to be exchanging parcels
sam is worried by this suspicious behaviour reinforced as it is by a ministry poster on the side of the building that illustrates almost identically the action we have just
seen along with the warning mind that parcel
eagle eyes can save a life
cut to the house being lowered and secured onto the lorry
jill is starting up the lorry
sam is glancing over her shoulder at the suspicious parcel which is tucked behind her
they move off
the last view of the power plant is of a group of men all in protective clothing and masks happily playing a game of volleyball
whats in the parcel
sam nods knowingly in the direction of the parcel
jill i dont know
sam picks it up
a heavy christmas present
he glances at her suspiciously
open it if you dont trust me
sam hesitates and puts the parcel down
id rather trust you
jill gives him a quizzical look and smiles slightly in spite of herself
she turns away so that he wont notice
what are you doing in information retrieval
looking for you
i mean it doesnt suit you
looking at his jacket suit me
dont you know the sort of thing that information retrieval does
what do you mean
would you rather have terrorists
weve got both
things would be worse without information retrieval
they couldnt be worse for the buttles
sam is at a loss
why dont you say no system is perfect
well no system is
say all wars have innocent victims
well all wars do who is this war against sam
well terrorists of course
how many terrorists have you met
its only my first day
jill bursts out laughing
sam joins in
they are both laughing hysterically as they approach the central supplies depot
the impression is that the place could be an abandoned airfield out to the use of a vast open air warehouse whose contents is arranged in a grid pattern of
streets all the streets being lined by stacks piles ranks jumbles of goods and objects which seem at first to be arbitrarily grouped some of them like the stacks of prefabricated houses standing in the open others protected under simple areas of roofing
each group of assorted supplies lies inside the squares of the grid of streets
the streets are eerily lit by lights just being switched on and each square is also lit by harsh localized lighting
the effect is a nightmarish gigantic aladdins cave of black shadows and garishly lit mountains of stuff
jills lorry starts down one of the streets
as they pass a clock in c s look at that right on time
i thought you were free to come and go as you please
unfortunately i do have to punch in by
slightly surprised every day
theyll be there waiting
theyre going to arrest you
i thought you arrested me
but this is real
he grabs for the emergency brake pushing his hand away cut it out sam
grabbing at the steering wheel will you please turn back
shoving him back get away
lunging for the steering wheel turn
unable to control him stop it
sam throws the lorry into a gut sucking skid
the lorry skids around a corner and roars down a side street of containers
sam and jill are fighting for control of the lorry
youre out of your mind
at that moment the air is split apart by the wail of sirens
sam and jill look back
from inside two strategically placed wooden containers stacked amongst the piles of containers marked automobiles burst forth two security vehicles
wood flying lights flashing wheels smoking they squeal away in pursuit
i was right
step on it
weve got to stop
now youre the one thats out of your mind
we cant outrace them
youll kill us
they struggle for control of the lorry
the lorry rumbles down the street of containers lurching from side to side as the battle in the cab wages back and forth
containers are smashed open and their contents spill out only to be further damaged as the pursuing security vehicles crash through them
the lorry escapes from the streets of containers and cannons through the main gate and out on to the streets of the city
sam and jill are still struggling violently for control of the lorry
sam is terribly inexpert as a driver but he behaves like someone possessed
through the rear view mirrors he can see the security vehicles catching up with them
he starts fumbling with he multiple gear levers
dont touch those
the lorry roars down a street of terraced houses and then screeches around a corner
sam pushes jills hand back and grabs for the lever that he thinks is overdrive
but rather than gaining speed there is a terrible lurch as the house and trailer disconnect from the cab
the house slides off the trailer which is skidding sideways and crunches to the ground just as the security vehicles round the corner
from behind the driver we can see that the house has settled across the roadway at right angle to the other houses making it appear to be a normal dead
so shocked is the driver that he fails to stop in time and kablow
the car smashes into the house
hot on the heels of the st car the nd vehicle skids and then smashes into the house which collapses and then explodes in flames
sam sits paralysed with shock
the lorry has come to a halt
jill is desperately trying to get him to move
come on lets go
lets get out of here
what have we done
dont blame me
it wasnt supposed to happen like this
looking behind shit
the house is on fire
and your children all gone
lady bird lady bird fly away home your house is on fire and your children all gone
do you think anyones hurt
tapping him on the forehead come out i know youre in there a security vehicle in full banshee howl roars through the streets
we roar along with it as it rounds a corner and skids to a halt at a safe but striking distance from jills lorry
heavily armed security police pour out and take up firing positions behind parked cars or whatever other cover is available
searchlights are played on the lorry
the officer in charge appears with a loud hailer
come out we know youre in there
you cannot possibly escape
throw your weapons from your vehicle and come out slowly with your hands on your heads
obey my instructions and no harm will come to you
but if you force us to shoot well shoot to kill
during the above speech a small boy on a tricycle roars around a corner behind the security police
he rides into a gap between them rolls his tricycle over and takes cover behind it
he points his toy rifle at jills lorry and takes shot
in reaction to the noise made by the kids rifle the officer in charge dives for cover and the security troops open fire and pepper jills lorry cab with holes
a few of the security troops then rush forward and fling open the cab door
the cab is empty
the officer in charge gets to his feet and looks about
his uniform is covered with dust oil and shit from the street
he just misses seeing the back of the boy as he disappears round the corner on his tricycle
to the lush sound of musak we glide through the glittering sensuous supportive world of ladies undergarments
as we slip past girdles bras panti hose for a variety of exotic occasions we come upon sam and jill pushing a shopping trolley
in the trolley is the suspicious parcel which jill was given at the power plant
this is a hell of a time to buy a nightie
are you still following me
i love you
there are plenty of other safe places
why dont we go back to my flat
leave me alone
youve got to trust me
it sounds silly but i know we were meant to meet
you mean you were meant to hijack my truck make me crash it and have every security man in town looking for me
i vas just trying to help
i decided to trust you
maybe i was wrong
whose side are you on really
who are your friends
who was the man who gave you the parcel
whats in it
its the only thing you saved from the lorry
it must he something very special
i saved you from the lorry and youre not very special
its a bomb isnt it
sam grabs the parcel from the trolley and tries to start tearing it open
im going to open it
grabbing parcel and trying to take it from him no youre not
they start an ugly little struggle for the parcel
sams suit gets slightly ripped
their tug of war is interrupted by a voice off camera
sam turns to see mrs terrain and shirley a short distance away
mrs terrain is heavily bandaged and sitting in a wheelchair which shirley is pushing
its me and shirley
from the terrains pov sam looks as if he is wrestling with a dummy or with himself if he is beside a full length mirror
the mirror or something obscures jill
mrs terrain and shirley exchange puzzled looks and proceed toward sam
hello mrs terrain
sam lets go of the parcel and pushes jill away
she moves off
after jill for mrs terrains benefit i think thatll hold it
to shirley hello shirley
just helping someone tie up a christmas present
how are you
my complication had a complication but dr chapman says ill soon be up and bouncing about like a young gazelle
are you buying a christmas present for your mother
trying to keep an eye on jill who is disappearing from sight er yes
shirley and i come here regularly
i love romantic lingerie
she unwraps a set of red and black fur trimmed things with strategic holes in them
coyly picture me in these
at this moment there is an almighty explosion from the far corner of the store
it is the corner that we last saw jill moving towards
sam races towards the smoke dust covering his suit
he finds bras knickers broken shop dummies bleeding customers and shop assistants all over the place
on the edge of this devastated area he sees jill struggling out from under a pile of negligees and plaster dust
he rushes over to her
frantic are you alright
anxiety giving way to anger you dont deserve to be
you should be dead or maimed like them
how could you
indicating the wounded what a bloody stupid thing
have made you open it in the lorry she has dug the parcel out of the debris and has ripped it open
under the brown paper are a dozen brightly coloured
christmas packages yes you guessed it executive toys
she throws the parcel and its contents hard into sams chest
he topples back wards tangling himself up with the severed limbs of a shop dummy
theres your bomb
our annual bribes for official ass holes like you
sam sits in the debris ashamed and relieved
liquor oozes from the broken bottle all over sams suit
he is at a loss for words
jills attention is attracted by moans coming from the badly hurt bomb victims
she goes to help them
to sam come on make yourself useful there are people hurt
jill goes around trying to make the injured comfortable
sam follows her
he takes off his jacket with his information retrieval badge on the lapel and uses it to make a pillow for one of these victims
by now sirens are wailing water sprinklers are functioning and there is general pandemonium
security guards run into the area and begin arresting everyone including the dead and injured
one of the guards tries to drag off the woman whom jill is attending
the guard gives jill a thump in the side of the face with his gloved hand
sam sees red
the guard looks up and as he does so he is transformed into the giant warrior from sams dream
he towers over the wounded the dying and the debris of the blasted lingerie department
sam grabs for a weapon and comes up with one of the arms now detached of the shop dummy
it makes a passable club
the two combatants square off
looking for an opening a chink in the others defences at which point sam is flattened from behind by a troopers gun butt
stone shipanti day a sam is falling down the inner wall of the stone ship
he tumbles end over end unable to stop his crashing descent
with a thud he hits the bottom
stunned bruised and battered he tries to get up
standing over him are the grey prisoners
they press forward
feebly where is she
is she here
the grey prisoners dissolve into what looks like several the baggees hang from a track on the ceiling of the black maria
sam is lying on the floor covered by his jacket with his badge prominently displayed
he is dazed and mumbling
the only baggee in the wagon apart from two guards who have removed their helmets and are relaxing while travelling back to base
scratching his head these helmets dont half make your scalp itch
ooh dont mention it
beginning to scratch his head and they make you sweat
half the time i cant see where im going theres a great niagara of perspiration coming down
im lucky ive got thick eyebrows
that keeps it up and channels it out to my ears
sam stirs and groans whos he
someone from information retrieval theyre always hanging about in lingerie
sam is coming to his senses
he takes in the situation sees all the baggees and staggers to his knees
are you there
he begins rummaging through the baggees
one of which is dressed as father christmas
sam opens the face vent of the baggees hoods
a pair of strange eyes look out
excuse me sir thats government property
is here a girl here
tall fair hair blue eyes
they check all that at the depot
sam continues fumbling about the baggees
pulling sam back we cant allow you to do that sir its more than our jobs worth
shaking guard off ive got to find her
you can always fill in an application form if youre a relative sir
please stop sir
sam takes no notice
guard a hits sam knocking him out again
sorry about that sir
well have you safely back in your office in no time
sam recovers consciousness to find himself sitting at his desk in his office
he is bruised and battered and has a black eye
his suit is torn and bloody
mr warren is gripping him by the throat and giving him a lecture
behind warren crowding the doorway are the people who circulate around him and are the cast of the warren high energy circus
lime is with them
this is a black eye for the department lowry
and i dont care how you behaved when you were at records
information retrieval is an executive branch
were proud of our reputation and we protect it
one of his accolytes thrusts a paper into his hand he glances at it
damn it lowry that convoy of troop carriers is still not accounted for i thought i told you to deal with it
he slams the form down onto the desk which is covered with other forms
and what the hell is this mess
an empty desk is an efficient desk
he has picked up some of the forms
queries from security searches from central banking about a cheque clarification notices from accounting concerning unreturned receipts another demand from the motor pool
i have to find out about
i dont know whats going on here lowry but dont think you can intimidate us with your friends and relatives in high places
now shape up
he dumps the papers and folders onto sams desk and storms off with his entourage leaving a gleeful lime in the doorway
grabbing lime as he starts to slip away lime i need to use your computer sorry a bit busy at the moment
he indicates sams smothered desk you seem to have quite a lot to do yourself
he disappears into his office a int
th floor corridor day a sam rushes out of his office after lime
but lime has locked his door
sam bangs on the door
sams office day b sam storms back into his office
reaching a peak of frustration he stuffs all his paperwork into the pneumatic tube and sends it off into oblivion
within seconds it returns
sam sends it off a second time
it doesnt return a second time periodically something passes through the tubes causing them to move
sams pneumatic tubes continue to pulsate pressure building up
at this point sams desk begins as before to creep through the wall
he grabs it violently
he pulls it
there is a scream from the other side of the wall
th pneumatic tubes give a final convulsion and then there appears to be a muffled explosion outside sams office door
it shakes the whole building
sam goes to his door and opens it
every door in the corridor has been opened by the occupants of the room
all the occupants stick their heads into the corridor all gazing with sam at the variously coloured blizzard of paper which has errupted through the whole length of the corridor
ceiling from which protrudes the intestines of the pneumatic system
it is the end of the working day
jack is leaving for home
he is putting on his executive styled bullet proof vest and packing his secret connection briefcase
as the scene progresses sam and jack proceed out of the door and down he corridor passing other i
sam is dishevelled and causing acute sartorial embarrassment to jack to is trying to distance himself from him
come off it jack
of course you can check to see if shes been arrested
im sorry sam im afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked
exasperated shes innocent jack shes done nothing wrong
tell that to the wives of the security men she blew up this afternoon
listen weve also had a report just in from central services that tuttle has wrecked an entire flat and sabotaged adjacent central services systems as a matter of fact in
id keep my eyes open if i were you sam
catching up with jack you dont really think tuttle and the girl are in league
steps into lift it could all be coincidental
there are no coincidences sam
everythings connected all along the line
cause and effect
thats the beauty of it
our job is to trace the connections and reveal them
whispers this whole buttle tuttle confusion was obviously planned from the inside
jack and sam have just emerged from the lift
the lift doors close
sam agitatedly speaks
jack shes innocent
sam weve always been close havent we
eagerly yes we have jack
well could you stay away from me until this thing blows over
sam is leaving the ministry of information retrieval
the lights in the foyer are blazing behind him the street lamps are lit
he is exhausted and depressed and anxious about the safety and whereabouts of jill
he begins to retrace their first journey together down the ministry front steps and around the corner to where jills truck was parked
just around the corner night a sam stands in the passageway where jills lorry was first parked
the only hint of its once upon a time presence is a small splodge of oil by the kerb
sam stands lost and beaten under a street light
he slumps down to the pavement unsure his next move
the street light is reflected in the pool of oil
as he stares at the reflected light it expands and becomes a patch of blue cloud filled sky
sam turns to look at the actual street light
it has become a crack of blazing light coming thru the inner wall of the great stone ship
stone shipanti day b im here sam
dont give up
sam is pushing thru the grey prisoners
the light from the crack shafts across the space in which they find themselves imprisoned striking the opposite wall
there in the bright pool of light are sams wings beautiful shimmering silver
but nailed to a large stone cruciform like a crucified eagle
sam rushes towards them and begins to pull them loose but before he can a great cracking noise reverberates thru the ship and a black shadow falls across sam and
looking round he saees the inner wall has split open to the level of the floor but blocking the opening is the giant samurai warrior
sam draws his sword and rushes toward the giant
the giant stands ominously still
then very slowly he raises his spear in front of himself in an almost religious gesture
sam is confused
suddenly a prisoner shouts a warning and sam spins round just in time to avoid a slash of the spear by the gigantic warrior who is now standing directly behind
sam parries a couple more thrusts of the spear and then strikes with his sword
at thin air
the giant has vanished again
sam cant figure it out
but he hears something whoosh and instinctively dodges as the giant who is once again behind him brings the spear crashing down
again sam manages a few parries as he is forced backwards
he trips and falls to the ground
the spear goes into the ground
before the giant can wrench the spear loose sam slashes at him with his sword
but again the giant disappears
sam spins around
the giant is a short distance from him
sam rushes him
again he vanishes
this time he reappears next to the spear and tries to free it
but sam attacks again and the giant is forced to do his vanishing act before he can recover the spear
sam is becoming exasperated with his behaviour and as the giant reappears he shouts at him to hold still at the same time throwing his sword at the big fellow
the sword pins the giants foot to the ground before he can disappear
instead of blood pouring from the wound fire issues forth
sam takes advantage of the situation and manages to wrench the spear from the ground
the giant is unable to escape as sam charges but manages to dodge a bit
however the spear catches his arm and opens a gash
again fire pours out
as the big guy tries to stop the fire sam charges again
this time he succeeds in striking dead centre
the giant gasps as fire gushes from his chest
he staggers and crashes to the ground
the wounds continue to bleed fire
sam gets his breath back and approaches the fallen warrior
reaching down he removed the giants mask
fire rushes forth from all the facial orifices
but the thing that makes him catch his breath is the face itself
while he stares in amazement the fire begins to melt the face
in a moment it is unrecognizable
sam stands there stunned
somewhere in the distance a bell tolls
sams face is reflected in the puddle of oil
he is staring wide eyed
a church bell tolls in the distance
sam is definitely spooked
he scrambles to his feet
hes got to get out of here
he heads off down the passageway but is brought quickly to a halt
there in the shadows is someone smoking a cigarette
he hesitates and reverses direction but before he manages paces a familiar voice comes from behind him
sam spins around
stepping out from the shadows is jill cigarette in her mouth
what are you do
how did you
are you alright
what happened to you after
are you hurt
i was worried sick about you
a patrol car approaches
quickly sam grabs jill and goes into a kiss to explain their presence
the car hesitates for a moment and drives on
through kiss theyre gone
through kiss are you sure
through kiss yes
they resume passionate kiss
after a moment urgently cmon weve got to get you off the streets
they head off clutching one another
the elysian fields train arrives clattering
sam and jill are the only passengers to emerge
they cant keep their hands off one another
this is young love at its freshest and most exciting
sam looks up and down the platform cautiously but there is no one in sight as the train clatters off again into the darkness
sam and jill approach sams front door
he puts a key in the door and tries to open the door but has some difficulty
he gives the door a heavy shove and the door opens and a shower of white powdery ice falls on his head
sam enters followed by jill
his breath immediately starts come out of his mouth like clouds of steam
the flat looks as though it has been disembowelled and then deep frozen
icicles are hanging down from everywhere
the flat looks like a scrap dump
every wall has spilled out its disgusting steel and rubber entrails filling most of the available space and making progress through the flat difficult
half a dozen men are at work
they are impossible to identify because they wear arctic clothing and look more like spacemen
their voices however belong to spoor and dowser
for gods sake whats happened
and then some
and then some
what have you done to my flat
sign here please
spoor offers a clipboard and pencil
he bangs the clipboard against the furniture to knock the ice off it
what is it
its a b of course
b of course
to dowser do you repeat everying
indicating the mess this is what you get when you have cowboys round yer ducts
i think youve got your t crystal inductor wired up to a reverse bobbin threaded solenoid control
its either that or a new washer
sign the form so we can get to it
get to it
sam grabs the clipboard and smashes it over spoors head
the board is so cold that it snaps in two
the paper on it also snaps in two
sam pulls jill out into the corridor
dont you like parties
weve got to get out of here
as sam and jill begin to move down the corridor they see a cigarette glow brightly in a dark recess
seeing cigarette light they ere about to run when tuttle steps out of the shadows
ill fix the damage when theyve gone
ill be ready for you tomorrow
a venerable porter carrying a single key on a large ring is preceding sam and jill along the corridor which we have seen before
the porters name is matthews
my mother said it would be all right
she didnt say anything about it to me
well shes my mother not yours
i wont be held responsible
how long will she he away
darkly there are some who go to dr
jaffes clinic who never come back at all
matthews unlocks mothers door
to jill youre not a professional are you
firmly thank you matthews
with which he ushers jill through the door and closes the door in matthews face
make yourself at home
dont answer the phone or open he door to anyone
i wont be long
where are you going
im going to pull some strings
its our only hope
dont do anything silly
thanks for the vote of confidence
sam arrives at the ministry of information retrieval reception its late
groups of cleaners are operating cleaning machinery
sam approaches the desk porter who is playing with the executive toy sam gave him
excuse me dawson can you put me through to mr helpmanns office
im afraid i cant sir
you have to go through the proper channels
and you cant tell me what the proper channels are because thats classified information
im glad to see the ministrys continuing its tradition of recruiting the brightest and best sir
thank you dawson
sam crosses the foyer checks to see that dawson is no longer watching him engrossed as he is with the executive toy and slips past the lift which at that
moment disgorges a leg bandaged be crutched lime who hobbles across the lobby without seeing sam who slips down the stairs which he knows lead to helpmanns private lift
sam creeps along the corridor to the lift door avoiding a group of security men who are singing carols in close harmony
one guard is conducting and giving instruction
they are all incredibly big and brutal looking
stopping them no no no arthur youre going flat on that g
its your breathing
take a breath on the end
of the previous line after noel
right one two three
the choir begins singing again
sam reaches the lift and looks at the small panel of letters set into the wall
close up of sams face concentrating
he hears we hear a reprise of mr helpmann talking to sam in mothers bathroom
of course jeremiah was senior to me but we were close friends and i keep his name alive at the office every day
its as though hes there speaking to me
ere i am j
sam is already typing the letters ereiamjh into the keyboard
the lift judders and star s to ascend
sam steps out of lift into an ante room
no one is there
tentatively he knocks on the connecting door into the office
he slowly opens door
are you there
the office is empty
sam looks around not sure what he wants to do
he notices his mothers picture on helpmanns desk
he is just about to leave when his eye is caught by an elaborate computer console in a side room
it occasionally chatters away
paper print outs fill a large bin
hesitantly sam approaches it
looking around to make sure the room is still empty he punches the on key and the machine lights up
he cautiously pushes a couple more keys
the teleprinter machines have paused but one starts chattering now
he looks at the one which is busy
a close up shows us the message coming through total total total car this is followed by a code number
the teleprinter falls silent
sam returns to the keyboard and switches it off
he turns to leave
the teleprinter starts chattering again
sam stops and goes back to it and looks at the page again
a close up shows us update subject trollope deceased cause of category
the computer spool revolves back and forth for two or three seconds and then stops
sam ponders this for a moment and then heads back to the keyboard and swtiches on the machine
he has he answer
sam enters the flat
jill is nowhere to be seen
the lights are out but from the partially opened bedroom door beams a shaft of bright light
music pours forth
it is cautiously jill
getting no answer he goes to the door and peers through
there is jill but transformed
she is wearing one of sams mothers wigs which billows in the air blown by a fan
she is also wearing a diaphanous nightdress borrowed from the extensive wardrobe and is dancing slowly
she looks like the dream girl
sam stands open mouthed
jill notices him and smiles
what do you think
is it me
still stunned you dont exist any more
ive killed you
jill layton is dead
he holds out a print out
she reads it and slowly looks up
care for a bit of necrophilia
they rush together
the screen is filled with brilliant white clouds rushing about a beautiful blue sky
they course this way and that
pulling back we reveal that this patch of sky is inside a mammoth glass like cube held aloft by four stone columns
the absolutely amazing scale of this cube is revealed as sam sweeps up into shot his wings gleaming in the light
he is a tiny speck but overjoyed he has found the day
far below him the grey prisoners gather beaming with happiness
diving back to the ground sam unsheaths his sword and holding it aloft rushes to the base of one of the great columns
the forces of darkness who have been lurking in the shadows slink back
sam with one mighty swing strikes the column the noise reverberates as cracks begin to race up and through the column
it is disintegrating
as it crumbles the mammoth cube begins to topple
everyone steps back
down it plummets
and smashes into a million pieces
the bright blue sky escapes in all directions
the grey prisoners iron collars and chains fall from their necks as they stand surrounded by a beautiful blue sky
they look up to the sun
sam is exultant
pull back from the sun through a window
the light falls on sams smiling sleeping face
showly he wakes
he little by little remembers where he is and reaches over for jill
she isnt there
she is sitting at the foot of the bed grinning at him
she crawls over to him they start to embrace
everything is going to be all right
its a raid
like a giant drill a whirling cylinder has plunged through the ornate moulded ceiling of mothers bedroom and we now see what made the neat hole in the buttle ceiling
cuts show doors being burst open by security troops
jill and sam are frozen in panic
security troops are sliding down a firemans pole from the hole in the ceiling
shouts shes dead
check the list
but it is sam they have come for
he is being dragged out of the bed
as they struggle with him you turncoat bastard
a canvas bag is plunged over his head
all goes black
muffled a shot rings out
it echoes through the blackness
in absolute inky darkness sam and the camera move through space and time marked only by voices and sounds encountered on the way
this sound sequence fades in and out a few times indicating that the journey is longer than the real time period of the blacked out sequence
we hear footsteps of sam and guards
distant howl of pain
lift doors opening and closing
a wonderful gift i changed it at the chemist for some antibiotics and bathroom scales and theres enough left on the voucher for a tonsilectomy if i want to treat
office door opens and closes
christmas parcel for you sir
sign here please
what looks like a rectangular hatch in the blackness opens
it is the eyeslit on the front of sams bag being opened by a security guard
the security guard peers in for a moment and then steps back to reveal two smart officials sitting at a desk
they are looking up at sam us
hks you are charged with the following passing confidential documents to unauthorized personnel viz ir dossier gillian layton
destroying government property viz an indeterminate number of personnel carriers
taking possession under false pretences of said personnel carriers
forging the signature of the head of records third department
attempting to misdirect ministry funds in the form of a cheque to a
buttle through unauthorized channels
tampering with central services supply ducts
employing unqualified suspected persons for this purpose
attempting to conceal a fugitive from justice
obstructing the forces of law and order in the exercise of their duty
giving aid and comfort to the enemies of society
bringing into disrepute the good name of the government and the standing within the community of the department of information retrieval
attempting to disrupt the ministry of information retrievals internal communicating systems
wasting ministry time and paper
we would advise you that a plea of guilty will save you and the tax payer money and will always be looked upon more favourably than a plea of not
all you are requested to do at this stage is to sign this form
official b waves a sheet of paper
we hear sams voice
what have you done with jill
the security guard appears briefly and zips up the hood again plunging us back into darkness
we get more muffled shouts heavy breathing and subterranean son et lumiere
another security guard opens the flap on sams hood
we see another two officials
more hysterical wheres jill
whats happened to jill
hks youve got quite a list of misdemeanours here havent you
all this is going to take time and money and im afraid according to your bank statement and credit rating here youre likely to be in deep financial trouble by
the end of it
now either you plead guilty to say seven or eight of these charges whichll bring the costs down to within your reach or you can borrow a sum to be
negotiated from us at very competitive rates
we can offer you something at say eleven and a half per cent over thirty years
but you will have to buy insurance to qualify for his scheme
all you have to do is to agree to sign the appropriate boxes on these forms
yes or no
im not guilty
not guilty you stupid bastar
the guard closes the flap
once again darkness and confusion
until another security guard opens the flap again to reveal another two officials
examining forms now since youve elected to plead not guilty on all these charges youd be well advised to take some sort of insurance cover
preferably comprehensive or if youd prefer something more specific say against electrical charges over f
and for food and accommodation costs of say
detention can be a very expensive business
now before we bore you with the small print perhaps youd like to tell us whether youd like to sign this insurance acceptance form or not
think carefully before you decide
thinking ahead in financial matters is always the wise course
the flap is closed and opened again very quickly new officials are revealed
this process repeats again and again getting faster and faster
the officials faces seem to become a changing blur
their voices overlap in a growing cacophony
the desk and the other items in the room remain static
to add to this disturbing effect the forces of darkness begin to gather in the room behind the officials
as they increase in number they begin to press forward unseen by the officials
soon they fill the view through the flap
were here to save you and the tax payer money
would you like to pay the premium for a single room with a shower and a soft bed
for a small charge we can keep visits from friends and relatives down to to a minimum
plead guilty its easier quicker and cheaper for everyone
were doing a survey
aimed at providing a better service
do you think the present system is a
as a taxpayer are you a
unimpressed cut to sam struggling with the forces of darkness
he is overwhelmed by the black hordes
they fill the screen
sam disappears under their onslaught
then sam is raised spread eagled above the black sea of the forces
strong hands hold him
the maniacal laughter starts up
sam is turned in its direction
cut to a shot over the top of the mass of robed figures
rising from the ruins of the stone columns the black cloth thing flaps menacingly towards camera
we can see the towering filing cabinet skyscrapers of the storeroom of knowledge in the background
sam looks terrified
as the thing hovers above sam in all its huge twisting awfulness it slowly begine to unfold like some deadly flower blooming in stop motion
sam freezes as the interior becomes invisible
there in the billowing blackness is the girl
she is beckoning
but the voice is no longer the mysterious feminine voice of before it is the voice of the maniacal laughter
sam struggles with the restraining hands
he twists and turns but to no avail
from the darkness above him descends the jolly gent looking just like mr helpmann on his window washers platform
however he is now dressed as father christmas
sam what are we going to do with you
ha ha ha ha ha
the filing cabinets of the storeroom of knowledge dissolve squares of padding that form the walls of a cell
the laughter echoes round the cell
sam sees that mr helpmann in his wheelchair is watching him
he is dressed as father christmas
they are alone in the cell
sam scrunches up into the corner
sam what are we going to do with you
can you hear me sam
in a hoarse urgent whisper wheres jill
what have you done to her
where is she
yes youve got to get me out of here
ive got to find her
i understand sam i know exactly how you feel
so i brought you a bottle of barley water
helpmann holds up a bottle of barley water
desperately help me
i assure you sam im doing everything within my power
but the rules of the game are laid down and we all have to play by them even me
this is all a mistake
dont you understand
yes well from the departments point of view youre certainly a bit of an own goal but
im not a terrorist
you must know that
im not guilty
get me out of here
sam if youve been going out there and playing a straight bat all the way down the line youve got absolutely nothing to worry about
please ive got to find jill
sam i think i ought to tell you
im afraid shes upped stumps and retired to the pavilion
sam looks blank
thrown in the towel
takes a moment to work this out dead
yes its all a bit confusing but it seems she was killed resisting arrest
relieved no no
i did that
helpmann looks surprised
sam shuts up
the odd thing is it appears to have happened twice
a bit of a disputed call im afraid
sam has gone catatonic
starting to go so there you are
all i can say is dont fall at the last fence
the finishing posts in sight
see you in the paddock
keep your eye on the ball
got to go
cant keep the orphans waiting
a guard helps him out and then returns with another to help put the restraining bag over sam
dont fight it son
before they get into the expensive procedures
if you hold out too long you could jeopardise your credit rating
the bag blacks everything out
the bag comes off
sam finds himself strapped into an information retrieval chair
the camera tracks back frighteningly fast revealing that he chair stands in an unbelievably vast room
the walls curve up and out of sight
the floor doesnt seem to be a floor at all strange light undulates beneath
the whole effect is one of total disorientation and overwhelming size
sam is desperately trying to take it in
next to the chair is a porcelain tray of evil and frighteningly ambiguous instruments
worrysome electrical connections and meters are near at hand
as the guards leave sam to take up their positions near the distant door they hand over documents to the white coated information retrieval officer
they all sign the document which the i
officer retains after giving carbon copies to the guards
the guards then proceed to the door and take up positions on either side of it
officer heads toward sam
we can now see he wears a mask
it is the face of the forces of darkness
a smiling baby doll face
sam sits mesmerized watching him approach
within fifteen or twenty yards of sam the i
officer comes to an abrupt halt
he seems to sway
after a moment he turns slightly hesitantly giving the impression that he may return to the door
he looks at the guards pauses straightens himself up takes a deep breath and continues again towards sam rather more briskly than before
sam watches terrified and fascinated
officer goes to the table which is covered with evil looking surgical type instruments he blunders clumsily into it knocking a couple of them onto the floor
he picks then up quickly and replaces them
officer reacts to this as if hes been hit in the solar plexus and he tries to disguise it by simulating a coughing fit
he then picks up a nasty looking implement and advances on sam
hysterically from behind mask shut up
jack im innocent
this is all a mistake
jack please take that mask off
jack is very close to sam he is shaking
he lifts up his mask to reveal sweaty face contorted with fear and anger
you stupid bastard
how could you do this to me
help me jack
how do you think i feel
pulling down mask shut up
this is a professional relationship
jack comes at sam with the horrifying implement
sams eyes widen in terror
from his pov we look up at jack approaching
the ceiling above and behind jack is suddenly and
loudly penetrated by the ceiling hole machine and in an instant without benefit of firemans pole the commando like figure of mr tuttle gun in hand leaps through the hole
tuttle is immediately followed by similar looking men with balaclavas guerilla type clothing and very efficient guns
jack is cut down
so are the two guards who have opened the door from the corridor and are shooting into the room
tuttle raps out into a walkie talkie detonate
from somewhere near at hand there is a large explosion which rocks the room
tuttle is already unstrapping sam
cut to rescuers with sam in the middle fighting their way in the terrific battle with guards until they get to a door leading to the stairs
cut to rescuers their members thinning and sam fighting down flight after flight of stairs with lots of neat oh violence and blood and gunshots and
falling and bleeding and cut to the rescuers fighting their way to the entrance
another group of rescuers at the door are providing cover fire the porter sits behind his desk watching the battle on his bank of monitors
weve only got thirty seconds to get clear
tuttle tosses sam a dark overcoat to cover his light grey detainee outfit
together the two groups burst out through the door into the large empty forecourt
the forecourt is suddenly illuminated by huge arc lights
machine gun installations open fire
the rescuers are totally exposed
they are cut down left and right
desperately they battle their way across the open space
time running out
sam knowing the way leads tuttle towards a shielded spot
will they make it
as the last rescuer is cut down sam and tuttle dive for cover
a massive explosion
security troops caught unprotected are decimated
sam looks up
the building is being blown to bits
certain windows are lit
they spell out merry xmas
with a final massive haemorrhage the building erupts in a geyser of masonry steel paper and dozens of t
consoles and visual aid apparatus including in large chunks mr helpmanns masterpiece
but also tons and tons of paper
every file in the building has burst its seams and ejected its load skywards
the night sky is full of white rectangular wisps
ashlike they flutter down over the city
sam looks around and cant see tuttle anywhere
he shouts for him
but the remaining troops have spotted sam and sam runs
sam runs madly through paper littered passages eluding his pursuers sam dives into a crowded garishly lit shopping centre
once among the protective company of he mindlessly shopping mob sam slows down and proceeds casually
the shoppers go about their programmed business paying no attention to the paperwork swirling about them
searching the crowd sam spots tuttle making his way towards him
tuttle is having a bit of trouble walking against the steadily increasing wind
as he proceeds across an open area a blown piece of paper
catches on his foot
he tries shaking it off
it remains firmly stuck
while he is struggling with the piece of paper another larger piece catches his other leg
he begins to lose his temper trying to dislodge the flying debris
another hits him and twists around his arm
still more paper blows against him
he is having difficulty staying upright
twisting this way and that he tries to free himself but more and more paper covers him
he is practically obscured from view
sam cant believe what he is seeing
shoppers continue about their business apparently unaware of tuttles terrible plight
apart from one shopper who loses control of her shopping trolley and watches it career down the steps of the shopping precinct
by now tuttle is totally encased in this cocoon of litter
he is now just a ball of paper writhing about on the ground
sam has to do something
he rushes out from his hiding place and tries to pull the litter off tuttle
the pieces come loose with surprising ease
the wind carries them away as sam frantically tears at the pile
but there is no sign of tuttle
the last few pieces of paper flutter away leaving sam standing there with a couple of posters in his hands
he realises that he is suddenly very visible
all the shopping bustle has stopped
they are all staring at him
sam spots troops shouldering their way towards him
he turns tail and dashes off
the drawing room door burst open as sam dashes in
sam goes straight through and into the bedroom
the room is empty of all terrestrial human life forms
a hollow wind blows the curtains
the room is in chaos and there is a hole in the ceiling
sam turns and sees a silhouette in the doorway
he rushes forwards
but its matthews the porter who is at the door watching sam running towards him
piously a sad loss
your mother was with her at the end
the doctor said there was no pain
sam grabs matthews round the neck and shakes him
where is she
sam comes running around corner
he is suddenly bathed in a strange blue light
he halts and looks up
there opposite him is a large blue neon cross above the entrance to a chapel of dully modernistic design
holy music from an electric organ can be heard
sam rushes up the stops and through the door
cut to sam slipping into the chapel in tight spot and suddenly being confronted by spiro the maitre d
ah yes mr lowry
its so good you could make it
right this way
sam dumbfounded follows
cut to sam being lead into the middle of the cold modern chapel which possibly for the occasion has been tarted up with some red velvet curtains that help make
it a bit theatrical
a large flower smothered coffin rests on some sort of raised stand in front of the altar a vicar stands in the pulpit and a fair sprinkling of people sit
in stepped seats on three sides of the room
the coffin is closed but a length of bandage has escaped the lid
standing amidst the floral tributes is a large rather idealized colour portrait of mrs terrain looking not so much young as beautiful
among the mourners are drs jaffe and chapman and others in their operating gowns
to enlarge on the scene we see shirley t snuffling in her hanky and a few others chatting amongst themselves the vicar standing in his pulpit waiting to get on
with it etc
cut to sam trying to take all this in stopping in the middle of the room
dont forget dr chapman sobbing
stopping and looking back at sam mrs lowry
mrs lowry is
in the background the vicar begins speaking and we hear his voice throughout the following action
cut to sams vicar in background at these times of giving and receiving lets remember the greatest gift of all not a gift to be spurned not a gift to
be opened and carelessly set on one side not a gift to be taken back and changed but the gift of eternal life
mrs terrain has just received that most wonderful of all gifts
she came to us physically new she goes hence from us not so physically new
but the spirit never grows old
and in the domain of the eternal giver mrs terrain shall dwell in bountiful joy forever
cut to sams pov
past spiro to a section in the bleachers directly across from the coffin and the vicar where a woman her back to sam is surrounded by a buzzing flock of
very handsome and well dressed young men
trying to take in scene what
starts to follow spiro coming up to back of woman madam
cut to woman turning half in flirtatious conversation
it is sams mother but miraculously another twenty years younger and
a parody of sams dream girl
uncertainty in her expression staring dumbly not knowing what to say mother
youve got to help me
embarrassed unsure not now
please belligerently ida is this fellow bothering you
getting up ill but before we can find out what hell cut to entrance to chapel as a squad of troops come crashing in
people begin to scatter screaming
the troops spot sam who dashes away from his mother and heads for a door behind the altar
in his panic he crashes against the coffin which topples over spilling its contents
a hundredweight of offal
sam covers his mouth and dashes through the door
cut to sam really dashing madly tripping over things hurting himself getting up running
he is in a maze of machinery
every way he turns his path seems blocked by either troops or figures from his dreams
the walls of the maze become more simplified as he goes deeper into it
more rectangular higher
we see a top shot of the maze with sam separate from the pursuing forces but they are closing in on him from all sides
the maze extends as far as we can see
sam turns left and right through it always there is a chance of turnings
he rounds a corner and for the first time there is nowhere to go
the maze leads straight ahead to a dead end
at the end of the maze is a great pile of detritus from the consumer society
televisions washing machines hair dryers junk
sam can do nothing but try to dig through this pile
maybe he can defend himself with something here
he scrabbles away
looking back he sees the massed agents troops forces of darkness heading toward him
he digs harder faster
junk flies everywhere
he actually reaches the end wall
back to it he turns to face the foe
but as he moves against the wall his hand touches something
a door knob
its a door
the knob turns easily
the door swings open
sam dives through it
sam finds himself in a strange little house empty of furniture except a few fitted cupboards and a fitted bed frame
he tries to lock the door behind him but there is no key
he puts his weight against the door to keep it shut
from outside there is the general noise of pursuit but this fades and resolves itself into a fairly quiet uniform engine sound
sam lets go of the door carefully
he looks around but there is only one window and it is shuttered
he carefully opens the door a crack and he sees sams pov a rapidly receding street
jills truck with the house on its back is driving dangerously through he streets
it lurches round the corner
the lurch throws sam to one side
he picks himself up and fighting the centrifugal force works his way to the shuttered window which is at the front end of the house in the wall opposite the
sam undoes the shutters and finds himself looking at the rear window of jills cab
he sees the back of the drivers head
the driver is wearing jills cap
he sees the back of the drivers cab
he bangs on the glass of the cab
the driver raises her head so that the face is visible to sam in the driving mirror
he sees that it is jill in a flat cap
she smiles at him
sam sobs with relief and love
the lorry travelling slowly now approaches then breasts the rise beyond which lies
looking more than ever
we zoom towards it through a mix
through the windscreen we see the dawn coming up ahead
the reverse shot shows us jill driving and sam next to her
they glance at each other
the lorry travelling slowly now approaches and then breasts the rise beyond which lies
a stunningly beautiful untouched valley
we zoom towards it through a half hidden in the heart of the valley is the truck with the house on its back
creepers and wild roses have grown up over the truck and some of the house
a curl of smoke rises from a makeshift chimney which has been attached to one of the walls
a small piece of ground around the truck has been cleared and made into a pretty garden with a vegetable plat
there is also a pretty cow and some chickens
jill appears locking like crusoe carrying a basket of eggs
sam is in the bed just waking up
he opens his eyes locking calm
off screen we hear the door opening
jill off screen morning
sam nods his head slightly on the pillow
quietly i dont dream anymore
he embraces her a high shot
everything in the garden is definitely lovely
the music tells us
the music swells and the camera slowly pulls back and back
its a happy ending
and then in the foreground two huge heads appear looking straight at the camera
it is mr helpmann and jack
they both shake their heads
hes got away from us jack
cut to their pov
sam is sitting in the ir chair
he is strapped in
his eyes are open but miles away
his face is wreathed in a benign and very happy smile
im afraid youre right mr
a wide shot of the room shows us helpmann and lint turn away and leave
sam is left alone
he is humming
the camera pulls back and back
the information retrieval room with sam in it floats away into the most beautiful glorious sky ever
sams humming into a full orchestra and we hear
brazil where hearts were entertained in june we stood beneath an amber moon and softly murmured some day soon we kissed and clung together then tomorrow was another day
the morning found me miles away with still a million things to say now when twilight beams the sky above recalling thrills of our love theres one thing im certain
of return i will to old brazil
