href b b jackie brown screenplay by quentin tarantino we hear the rhythm of funky seventies soul music
then she steps into frame
she is jackie brown a stewardess dressed in her cabo air uniform
a little shuttle airline that flies from los angeles to cabo san lucas
approximate flight time forty five minutes jackie stands still as a people mover slowly inches her through the airport
the credits apear and disappear in front of her
jackie brown is a very attractive black woman in her mid forties though she looks like shes in her mid thirties
the people mover reaches the end of the line she steps off
she breezes through customs and we follow her with a stedicam as she strides through the airport
she gets to her gate disappears inside the plane for a moment comes back out sans flight bag picks up the microphone
into mike flight cabo san lucas now boarding gate first class only
with a smile on her face she collects passengers boarding passes as they board the plane
a chorus line of six beautiful bikini clad women all holding different automatic weapons blasting away
the cheap video titles to play over this image
one bikini beauty is singled out
shes a gorgeous brunette named sidney
sidney stands facing camera holding a tec and describing it
to camera hi im sidney
and i love to tec
the popular tec is advertised by its makers as being tough as the toughest customer
sidneys statistics age height measurements date of birth appear at the bottom left hand corner
as sidney continues her sales pitch demonstration a black mans voice begins talking over the video
thats a tec
its a cheap ass spray gun outta south miami
after a closeup of the tec sidney fires the weapon
cost three eighty retail
i get them for two hundred and sell em for eight
the black voice belong to forty five year old ordell ordell wears clothes nice and likes wearing nice clothes
stylish athletic wear reebok heavy black leather jackets hugo boss warm colored berets and baseball caps to cover his balding head are ordells look
at this moment ordells wearing an open silk shirt
ordell narrates the video playing on the big screen v
the most expensive thing in the apartment
he holds a cocktail in one hand screwdriver his drink of choice and the remote control in the other pacing the floor in his i can talk anybody into anything
louis gara who looks like he does his shopping at the salvation army dressed in a hawaiian shirt and dungarees sits on the sofa staring blankly at the video drinking
jack daniels on ice
louis white also in his mid forties has lived over half of his life in penal institutions
the experience has affected both his body language and his thought process
while acutely aware of the rhythm of life inside a correction facility in the real world his timing is thrown
its like a song he doesnt know the lyrics to but attempt to sing anyway
the third person watching the video is the person who lives in this apartment melanie ralston
melanie thirty three is a tanned blonde california beach bunny
like the kind you se in the old crown international movies from the seventies like pom pom girls malibu beach and beach girls except melanie is older than any of
those girls ever are
shes dressed in her melanie uniform of stringy levis cutoffs and a stringy bra top
so far melanie has been able to make a living out of lying in the sun always finding a generous wealthy man more than willing to pay her rent and
pick up her tabs
in her prime twenty two it was japanese industrialists film production guys and middle eastern businessmen who kept melanie
and it was places like the bahamas acapulco and the virgin islands where they kept her
but now at thirty three she lives in an apartment in hermosa beach california that ordell pays for an drops in and out of
shes curled up in a reclining chair smoking weed from a pipe reading movieline magazine and paying no attention to the video
they advertise it as being the most popular gun in american crime
can you believe that shit
it actually says that on the little booklet that comes with it
most popular gun in american crime like theyre proud of that shit
ordell hits the fast forward on his remote control
sidney is rushed off the screen and replace by cindy a pretty blonde bodybuilder clad in a red white and blue bikini holding a styer aug
check out this body builder chick
now see what she got
thats a styer aug
styer augs a bad motherfucker
ordell punches up the volume
cindy blasts the styer aug loud
ordell imitates the sound of the weapon

ordell hangs up the phone
the store front window of cherry bail bonds in inglewood california
the name of the business is spelled out on the window which also includes a drawing of a fat red cherry
ordells black mercedes convertible pulls up
ordell in the drivers seat
louis in shotgun position
inside cherry bail bonds looking out through the picture window
we can read the name on the glass backwards
ordell and louis appears in the window and enter the building
ordell carries a l
lakers athletic bag
an unidentified male voice obviously on the telephone can be heard
ordell goes toward the voice and tells louis to hang back
the judge doesnt give a fuck about that
hes ready to habitualize you
is that what you want you wanna look at ten years
the voice belong to max cherry bail bondsman
max a regular joe type white guy in his fifties sits behind his desk talking on the phone
his eyes raise as he sees ordell approach him
on phone just overnight is all

ordell motion to the chair in front of maxs desk
max motions for ordell to take a seat
on phone reggie there aint no two ways about it
youre spending the night in jail but i already told you ill get you out tomorrow
now where are you
pause youre at your mothers house arent you
ordell lights up a cigarette
he notices a picture on the wall of max with his arm around a big powerfully built black man
theyre both grinning
louis pours himself some coffee from a coffeemaker into a small white styrofoam cup
he picks up a jar of powdered non dairy creamer thats so dry he has to break off a rock
louis adds the rock of coffeemate to his beverage
on phone okay
just stay put till i come for you
pause reggie do yourself a really big favor and be there when i get there
he hangs up the phone
ordell sits in front of the desk smiling at him and smoking
how can i help you
indicating the viceroy where would you like me to put my ash
max looks at him for a moment
use that coffee cup on the desk
ordell picks up the coffee cup which still has a little bit of coffee in it and flicks his ash
and i need me a bond for ten thousand
max throws a look past ordell to louis
oh thats just my white friend louis
hes got nothing to do with my business
we just hangin together

from across the room louis nods his head in maxs direction
max looks at him a moment then back to ordell

max looks at ordell getting his drift then says so you want a ten thousand dollar bond

max taking papers out of the drawer

louis enters the area standing over ordell

ordell pulls out a heavy duty keychain with a shitload of keys on it
take the keys man
listen to music

ordell finds it
while he goes through the keys vicki comes back on the line
max speaks with her as he fills out his papers
holding a key this ones for the ignition
holding a little black box but you gotta hit this thing to shut the alarm off and unlock the door
what do i do

youll hear the car go bleep
that means the alarms off and the doors are open

i got them set just the way i want em
louis nods and goes out
louis walks out of the office
he goes up to ordells black mercedes
he points the little black box at it
the car goes bleep
he gingerly approaches it opens the door and climbs inside
max hangs up the phone
to ordell beaumont livingston
on his prior he served nine months and hes working on four years probation
you dont say

possession of unregistered machine guns
will they consider this a violation of his probation

ordell hands him the lakers bag
max takes the money out putting it on the desk

in your drawer
max begins counting it
across the street a great western
it goes in a trust account
youll need to fill out an application for appearance bond an indemnity agreement a contingent promissory note
thats the one if beaumont skips and i go after him you pay the expenses
beaumont aint going nowhere
he takes a pen out of his pocket where do i sign
max pulls the forms from his desk and lays them in front of ordell
max goes back to counting the money
ordell reads the first agreement then says reading the form hey max
still counting money yes
still reading form i was wondering
what if before the court date gets here beaumont gets hit by a bus or something and dies
he puts the form down and looks at max i get my money back dont i
pressing a black button next to the name beaumont beaumont livingston wearing no shirt sweatpants and smoking a fatty answers the intercom which buzzes loudly
we can hear jay leno interviewing a celebrity on into the speaker who is it
ordell stands outside the security gate of beaumonts hollywood apartment
extreme closeup ordells lips talking into the intercom speaker
its your benefactor nigga

extreme closeup beaumonts finger pressing the entry button
extreme closeup the doorknob on the security gate buzzing
ordells hand comes into frame twisting it open
beaumont opens his apartment door fatty between his fingers
he sees ordell approach
ordell greets him arms spread out in hug mode with a big smile across his face

ordell and beaumont embrace

this has the desired effect
beaumont comes out of the apartment sporting nikes and a queen latifah t shirt
he locks his front door and walks with ordell to his car
they talk the whole way
we stedicam in front of them the whole way
whats the problem
well it aint so much a problem a a situation
remember i sold those three m machine guns outta the five i got

this group of koreans in koreatown have started a neighborhood watch kinda thing
and they want a few weapons so the neighborhood niggas know they mean business
so im gonna sell em my two machine guns tonight

now i aint worried
asians are by and large real dependable
they dont want no trouble
you might argue about price but you aint gotta worry about them shootin you in the back
but i got me kind of a rule
never do business with nobody you aint never done business with before without backup
thats why i need you backup
man i aint ready to be goin out nowhere let me finish
can i finish
the trunk of a car is opened
ordell bends down into the trunk and pulls out a pump action shotgun
beaumont obviously doesnt want any part of any ordell game that requires a pump action shotgun as a playing piece
now youre gonn be in the trunk holding onto the shotgun
and im going to tell them im opening up my trunk to show em my goods
i open up the trunk you pop up rack that bad boy

i wanna help you but i dont wanna be locked in the trunk of no car
you think i wanted to spend ten thousand dollars on your ass
beaumont starts to speak answer the question nigga

but the only way to help you was to do that so i did it
pause okay how bout this

uuuuummmmm thats some good eatin
beaumont and ordell laugh together
the beaumont says now exactly how long i gotta be in this motherfucker
beaumont in the trunk holding the shotgun
the trunk lid is slammed closed
ordell walks around the car climbs into the plush interior of the olds and turns on the engine
it comes to life with a soft rumble
he puts a tape in the player inside the dash
the tape is labeled ordells jams
cool old school r b fills the cab
ordell cruises moving his head to the rhythm and mouthing the words
he drives for awhile just groovin on the music
ordell switches the engine and the music off
the cab goes black
he leans over the passenger seat opening the glovebox
a tiny light turns on when the glovebox is opened
its the only light in the cab
ordell leaves it on
in silence he takes one glove out and puts it on his right hand
then with his gloved hand reaches in the glovebox and pulls out a five shot
he closes the glovebox
the cab goes black
the olds is parked out in the middle of some urban nowhere
ordell gets out sticks the snubby in his pants and walks to the back of the olds
he sticks his key in the trunk and says dont worry
its just me
the trunk opens
beaumont is hunched on his side with the shotgun
i was wondering
did any federal people come visit you in jail and i should be watching my ass
beaumont doesnt say anything
you wouldnt tell me if they did and i wouldnt blame you
ordell takes the snubby out of his pants
beaumont quick racks the pump shotgun pulls the trigger and hears the click you hear from an empty weapon
he racks it again click then bam
beaumont is shot hard in the chest
he goes back into he trunk
ordell puts one more shot in his head bam tosses the weapon on top of the dead body and closes the trunk
ordells beaumont problem is solved
he climbs back into the cab turns on the engine
we hear the old school r b song come back on but very low
ordell drives the olds away
louis sits on a bed in a flophouse motel room flipping from one channel to another with a remote control drinking cocktails from a can
the phone rings
he answers it
ordell is sitting parked in the comfy cozy cab of the olds listening to soul music with his tiny cellular phone next to his ear
louis my man
oh i dunno
just kinda goin back and forth
they had some black girl from some black show on jay leno
i watched that for a bit but i kept flippin channels cause i didnt know who she was
guess where i am
i know you dont know
i said guess

i just told you im comfortable
i aint about to walk into that roach motel and get uncomfortable
you bring your ass out here
im in my underwear
then put your goddam drawers on and get your ass out here
i got somethin to show you
louis having just thrown on some pants walks outside his room and sees ordells big black oldsmobile parked in front of the motel
as he approaches the power window on the drivers side comes down revealing a comfortable ordell sitting back in his seat looking up at louis
you know what your problem is louis
louis doesnt say anything he just puts his hands in his pockets
you think youre a good guy
when you go into a deal you dont go in prepared to take that motherfucker all the way
you go in looking for a way out
and it aint cause youre scared neither
its cause you think youre a good guy and you think theres certain things a good guy wont do
thats where were different me and you
cause me once i decide i want something aint a goddam motherfuckin thing gonna stop me from gittin it
i gotta use a gun get what i want im gonna use a gun
nigga gets in my way nigga gonna get removed
understand what im saying
trunk opens showing beaumont shot in the chest with half his head blown off
louis looks inside see beaumont looks at ordell then back to beaumont
ordell closes the trunk
who was that
that was beaumont
who was beaumont
an employee i had to let go
what did he do
he put himself in a situation where he was gonna have to do ten years in the penetentiary thats what he did
taking out a viceroy and lighting it up and if you know beaumont you know there aint no way in hell he can do no ten years
and if you know that you know beaumonts gonna go any goddam thing beaumont can to keep from doin those ten years including telling the federal government everything they want
to know about my ass
now that my friend is a clear case of him or me
and you best believe it aint gonna be me
you know what im sayin
you gonna come in on this with me you gotta be prepared to go all the way
i got me so far over a half a million dollars sittin in lockboxes in a bank in cabo san lucas

walker make us one more delivery im gonna have me over a million
you think im gonna let this little cheese eatin nigga here fuck that up
shit you better think again
fore i let this deal get fucked up ill shoot that nigga in the head and ten niggas look just like em
pause understand what im sayin
so we on the same page then
ordell smiles not his hustler smile but a genuine smile
they both bump fists
the sound of airplanes landing and taking off can be heard underneath this
a subtitle reads we look down a row of cars in an enclosed parking garage at lax
jackie brown the cabo air stewardess from the opening credits walks into frame
we dolly behind her as she walks down the row of cars
she turns towards the voice camera
young plainclothes cop mark dargus walks up to her holding open his i
hi im detective mark dargus
can i ask what you have in that bag
the usual things
im a flight attendant with cabo air
young plainclothes cop ray nicolet enters the scene
can i be of some assistance
as jackie pulls the cigarettes davidoffs from her purse she says to ray i doubt it
to dargus whos your friend
this is special agent ray nicolet with alcohol tobacco and firearms
would you mind if we looked in that bag
jackie lights her cigarette with a yellow bic lighter
would i mind
do i have a choice
you have the right to say no
and i have the right to make you wait here with ray while i go get a warrant
and if i dont want to go through all that trouble i could just take you in on suspicion
suspicion of what
all he wants to do is peek in your bag
ill watch he doesnt take anything
jackie shrugs and says go ahead
dargus lays the flight bag on the pavement gets down on his haunches and starts feeling through her things
a soiled blouse uniform skirt then a manila envelope a fat one nine by twelve
jackie watches him straighten the clasp
out drops several packets of one hundred dollar bills secured with rubberbands
dargus looks up at her
id say theres about oh fifty thousand dollars here
what would you say ray
that looks like fifty thousand dollars from here
not saying anything at the moment
this is your money
if i were to tell you no it isnt
you should know if you bring in anything over ten thousand you have to declare it
you forgot or what
you could get a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine plus two years in prison
now you want to talk to us about it or you want to talk to customs
im not saying another word
listen jackie hope you dont mind if i call you jackie
theyre a bunch of fuckin pricks in customs
something about that job makes them kinda hard to get along with
now do you want to talk with a bunch of suspicious disagreeable people like them or a couple good hearted guys like mark and myself
doesnt smile back
sitting in a chair facing the two offscreen detectives
jackie lights up a cigarette
we dont leave the closeup until noted
hey this is my office
theres no smoking
nicolet laughs o
we could smart ass
or we could work out whats known as a substantial assistance agreement
that is if youre willing to cooperate
tell us who gave you the money and who youre giving it to
jackie doesnt sat anything
she just smokes
you got a good lawyer
can she afford a good one is the question
otherwise shell be in sybill brand three weeks easy before the public defender gets around to her
ever heard of a fella named beaumont livingston
not a word
dont know beaumont
thats funny cause beaumont knows you
well he did know you beaumont was found in the trunk of a car dead
once in the head and once in the chest
jackie she puts the ool in cool
i had the chance to talk to beaumont yesterday
you see like you beaumont found himself in some hot water
he was looking at ten years he was pretty sure he didnt want to do and was understandably concerned
now maybe you dont know beaumont but beaumont knew you and maybe so does the guy who blew beaumonts head off
not a word
if you dont want to talk to us i guess well just have to hand you over to customs
jackie puts out her cigarette
okay lets go
she stares down the cops
we cut to the detective and the special agent for the first time in the scene
you know miss brown theres basically three types of people that we come along in the performance of our duty
one is innocent people
victims witnesses innocent bystanders
you aint any of these
then theres two criminals
these sonabitches have dedicated their lives to a life outside the law
that aint you either
where you belong is the third category
the category we refer to as losers
jackies eyes dont even narrow at the insult
she just says without expression im not a loser
oh youre both
in you were flying for twa and got busted for carrying drugs
you were carrying them for a pilot husband of yours
he did time and you got off
but that ended your career with the big airlines
cut to thirteen years later
youre forty four years of age
youre flying for the shittiest little shuttle fucking piece of shit mexican airline that there is
where you make a whopping twelve thousand dollars a year
that aint a hulluva lot to show for a twenty year career
and to top it off youre going to jail
now true the judge even with your prior will probably only give you a year or two
but this doesnt seem like the time of life you got years to throw away
pause now we dont like trying losers like theyre criminals
but in the absence of a criminal we will try you
now wasnt this money given to you by an american living in mexico by the name of cedric walker
jackie remains unmoved by this monologue
nicolet joins back in
you know ol beaumont wasnt much for talkin either
yeah he told us about you and mr
walker but whoever the hell it was he worked for out here he wouldnt say
could it be the same person you were supposed to deliver this money to
jackie just stares at them saying nothing
dargus sits behind his desk with jackies flight bag on it
id like your permission to open this again
so well know exactly how much money were talkin about here
jackie gets up from her chair walks over to the desk unzips the bag takes out the manila envelope and drops it on the desk
while youre at it let me see what else is in there
she reaches in the bag and brings out a pocketbook
whats in it
nicolet takes the manila envelope
ill count the money
dargus points at a clear plastic bag with pills and packets in it
thats my diet shit
nicolet takes out the bills from the envelope
lets see what else is in there
nicolet takes the bills and looks inside the envelope
his expression changes to a shit eating grin
oh miss brown
nicolet pulls out a clear cellophane sandwich bag with a half inch or so of white powder inside
and what would this be sweet and low
what the fuck is that shit
i know what it looks like
you planted that shit on me
nicolet and dargus laugh at that
look that shit aint mine
to dargus it isnt enough for trafficking but how bout posession with the intent to distribute
oh i wouldnt be so sure
what with all the cash i think i could go with conspiracy to traffic
im tellin you i dont know nothin about that fuckin shit
well then miss brown
why dont you have a seat and tell us who might know something about this fuckin shit
jackie just looks at the two grinning cheshire cats as the balance of power rolls over on her
a los angeles county jail bus pulls up behind the torrance court house
jackie now wearing county jail blues sits next to another black woman
their hands cuffed together
the bus stops
a rough looking female county sheriff unlocks the gate that encloses the prisoners
then explains in a you better do exactly what i say manner how theyre going to leave the bus
many women including jackie all wearing county blues and handcuffed to each other exit the bus
the sheriffs lead them into the back entrance to the court house
dargus and nicolet confer with the public defender an attractive blonde woman in a nice business suit
if shell cooperate with us well turn possession with intent into plain ol possession and she can bond outta here for one thousand bucks
if she doesnt help us well go for the intent and request a twenty five thousand dollar bond
jackie and the public defender
jackie in her county blues public defender in her nice suit
you tell those guys theyll have to do one helluva lot better than that before ill even say hi to them
well thats the states offer
if you plead to possession and tell l
what they want to know your bond will be set at one thousand dollars
if you dont l
will request one at twenty five thousand based on your prior record and risk of flight
if you dont post it or dont know anyone who can youll spend six to eight weeks in county before your arraignment comes up
whos side are you on
i beg your pardon
what if i plead guilty
you might get probation
if i dont cooperate
with the prior
you could get anywhere from a year to five depending on the judge
you want to think about it
you got two minutes before were up
its a full schedule in court today
jackie sits with a bunch of other females wearing county blues in the defendants area where the jury sits during a jury trial dargus and nicolet sit in the courtroom
the judge reads the next case
jackie rises amongst the other defendants
dargus the arresting officer rises
the charge is possession of narcotics with the intent to distribute
how does your client plead
she wishes to stand mute your honor
to dargus detective dargus youre the arresting officer in his case correct
thats correct your honor
you have a recommendation for bail
yes i do your honor
based on the defendants prior conviction and the extreme possibility of flight due to her occupation the state requests a bond of no less than twenty five thousand
the judge looks at the report then at jackie
ill set bond at ten thousand and set the date of august th for the arraignment
when is that your honor
thats six weeks from now miss brown
well continue this matter then
jackie sits down
dargus sits down next to nicolet
they smile and giggle together
jackie sees them giggle like fifth graders
it fucking pisses her off
we go from a closeup of a boiling jackie to a perspective from the back of the courtroom
we see jackie in the defendants area
we see the two happy detectives walk past us on their way out of the courtroom
sits in the back watching the proceedings without any expression
when hes seen enough he stands up and out of the shot leaving an empty frame
the bathroom door in maxs office
we hear a toilet flush behind it
the door opens and max cherry emerges zipping up his pants with a tv guide in his hand
he looks up and stops dead
ordell sitting oh so comfortably in the chair in front of maxs desk
i dint hear you wash your hands
max looks at ordell then takes his place behind his desk
the door was opened so i just came right in
i can see that
i got some more business for ya
what did he do
she is an airline stewardess
got caught coming back from mexico with some blow
they set her bond this afternoon at ten thousand
now what i was thinkin you could use the ten thousand you owe me from beaumont and move it over on to the stewardess
the bond for possession is only a thousand
they fuckin wit her
they callin it possession with intent
a black woman in her forties gets busted with less than two ounces on her they call that shit intent
same shit happened to a movie star
it still sounds high
she had i believe it was
fifty grand on her too
there was a cop at the hearing
young guy with l
wanted her bond set at twenty five thousand saying there was a risk of flight
jackie being a stewardess and all
before we start talking about stewardess lets get beaumont out of the way first
sitting back in the chair almost grinning but not quite
somebody already did
you didnt hear
somebody with a grudge blew beaumonts brains out hey that rhymes blew beaumonts brains out
did the police contact you
very first motherfuckin thing they did
they see i put up a big money bond on my boy they start thinking with that where theres smoke theres fire logic
they roust my ass outta bed ten oclock in the morning
fuckin scare my woman sherona half to death
she thought they were gonna take my ass away for sure
do you know her last name
smiles brown jackie brown
what does she do for you
who says she does anything for me
shes my friend
when my friends get into trouble i like to help em out
beaumont worked for you
thats what the police thought
i told them im unemployed how could i have anybody work for me
now i bail out jackie im liable to have the police on me again huh
wanting to know was she doing things for me was she bringing me that money
is this me and you like a lawyer client relationship
the lawyer cant tell nothing he hears
youre not my client until you get busted and i bond you out
if theres no what do you call it confidentiality between us
why would i tell you anything
cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are
you got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand
why would a stewardess bring me fifty grand
you want me to speculate on what you do
id say youre in the drug business except the moneys moving in the wrong direction
whatever youre into you seem to be getting away with it so more power to you
okay you want another bond and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on beaumont to the stewardess
that means paperwork
i have to get a death certificate present it to the court fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral then type up another application
an indemnity agreement jackie aint got time for all that shit im telling you what i have to do
what you have to do in case you forgot is come up with premium of a thousand bucks
i got it
i just dont got it on me
well come back when you do and ill bond out the stewardess
man you know im good for it
thousand bucks aint shit
if i dont see it in front of me youre right
it aint shit
man you need to look at this with a little compassion
jackie aint no criminal
she aint used to this kinda treatment
i mean gangsters dont give a fuck but for the average citizen coupla nights in county fuck with your mind
ordell this isnt a bar an you dont have a tab
just listen for a second
we got a forty year old gainfully employed black woman falsely accused falsely accused
she didnt come back from mexico with cocaine on her
falsely accused of intent
if she had that shit and mind you i said if it was just her shit to get high with
is white guilt supposed to make me forget im running a business
ordell gives up and takes an envelope out of his pocket
i got your money
but dont you ever ask me for no fuckin favor
its early evening and maxs powder blue seville is driving to the county jail with a client a young hispanic woman of twenty named anita
tomorrow ill talk to your probation officer
karens a good kid but shes mad at you because you lied to her
this business about your grandmothers funeral i went
i took my mother and little brother
but you didnt ask permission
you broke a trust
if you had asked karen probably would have let you
im sure she would
thats why i went
but then you told her you were home
sure cause i didnt ask her if i could go
max gives up
i dont know
maybe its a language problem
getting stern anita you ever cause this much heartache over something that could easily be avoided ill never write you again
i mean it
i dont care how many times your mother calls or how much she cries
like an exasperated teenager
then say yes max
yes max i understand
max and anita side by side
anitas hands are cuffed behind her back
dropping off and picking up
dropping of lopez anita
picking up brown jackie
were at the admitting desk of the l
max undoes anitas handcuffs while a sheriff waits to take her away
so youre gonna call karen tomorrow
ill call her
i wont forget
she kisses max on the cheek and the sheriff takes her away
see you later
max puts the cuffs away sits on a bench takes out a len deighton paperback and begins to read
still reading his novel
we hear offscreen a sheriffs voice
here she comes
max puts his book down and see jackie being led into the admitting area by two sheriffs
shes wearing her stewardess uniform and carrying a small envelope with her belongings in it and her shoes
when max was imagining a woman in her forties he had someone with a bit of wear and tear on them in mind
but this jackie browns a knockout
as he watches her she steps out of the county jail slippers she was wearing and slips into her shoes
he approaches handing her his card
im max cherry
im your bail bondsman
she takes the card and shakes his hand saying nothing
i can give you a lift home if youd like
max puts his key in the ignition when jackie asks are you really a bail bondsman
who do you think i am
she doesnt answer
i gave you my card there
can i see your i
max digs the case out of his pocket hands it to her then reaches up and turns on the light above them for her to see
who put up my bond
she looks straight ahead
max shifts into drive
max rolls down his window at the front gate
a deputy comes out of the gatehouse and hands through the window maxs
revolver cylinder opened
max hands the deputy his pass in exchange for the gun says thanks then puts the
in his glovebox in front of jackie
he drives on
can we stop for cigarettes
sure ever been to the riverbottom
i dont think so
its a cop hangout
couldnt we just stop at a seven eleven
i thought you might want a drink
id love one but not there
we could stop at the hilton by the airport
is it dark
its kind of a sports bar that doesnt sound dark
why does it need to be dark
cause i look like i just got outta jail thats why
you droppin me off at home right
theres a place by me
a big neon sign of a cockatoo sits on op of a red brick inn
closeup a knob is pulled out
jackie picks up a pack of mild sevens cigarettes from the bottom of a cigarette machine
she crosses the bar to join max sitting at a small table waiting for her to return
the cockatoo inn is just what jackie was looking for
a dark and red cocktail lounge in hawthorne off of hawthorne boulevard by the apartment where the stewardess lives about ten minutes from lax the clientele of the cockatoo is
an older black crowd and an even older white crowd whod been coming here years before it became a black bar
a jukebox plays soft old school r b
jackie and max sit side by side at a small table lit by a bar candle in a red glass thing
max drinks bushmills over crushed ice
jackie drinks white wine
jackie opens her mild sevens offering one to max
no thanks i quit three years ago
as she lights her cigarette
you gain weight
i lose it and put it back on
thats why i dont quit
if i cant fly anymore im gonna have a bitch of a time gettin my brand
whats your brand
i get em in mexico
theyre hard to find here
i was locked up with the last two getting legal advice from a woman who was in for bustin her boyfriends head open with a baseball bat
was she helpful
she was more helpful than the fuckin public defender
she takes a sip of wine i dont know i guess what i need is a lawyer find out what my options are
you know i figured out the other day ive written something like fifteen thousand bonds since ive been in the business
id say about eighty percent of them were at least drug related
if you want i can help you look at your options
jackie takes the talk in a different direction
youre not tired of it
smiles i am as a matter of fact
a moment of silence between them they both take drinks
what have they told you
so far ive been told i can cooperate and get probation maybe
or i can stand mute and get as much as five years
does that sound right
id say if youre tried and found guilty you wont get more than a year and a day
thats state time
under her breath shit
but they wont want to take you to trial
theyll offer you simple possession a few months of county time and a year or two probation
pointing to her drink how bout another
max gestures to an older black cocktail waitress named rowen for two more
you know who put the dope in your bag
yeah but thats not what this was about
they were fuckin waitin for my ass
they knew i had that money they even knew the amount
the one who searched my bag from l
dargus hardly even looked at it
oh id say theres fifty thousand here
what would you say
but all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to customs and i could tell they didnt want to do that
they wanted you to tell them what you know
i had em too
i burnt those two starky and hutch motherfuckers down
then their asses lucked out and found that coke
what did they want to know
who gave me the money and who i was giving it to
and some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off
said it was him who told them bout me
the waitress comes with the drinks
can i get you two some popcorn
that would be beaumont livingston
how do you know em
i wrote him on monday
they found him dead on tuesday
ordell pick up his bond
same as you
the federal agent kinda half hinted ordell might of done beaumont
you mentioned a guy from l
but you didnt mention the federal
no you didnt
ray nicolet with alcohol tobacco and firearms
max puts it together
hes the one who wants you
it was the other guy who busted me
cause if he busted you youd play hell bonding out of federal court
he doesnt want you mad at him he wants you to tell him what you know
he uses you to get a line on ordell make a case then take him federal
you know what ordells into
i have a pretty good idea
ordell aint no bootlegger and i doubt hes smugglin cuban cigars
so that only leaves one thing an a
man would be interested in
jackie waits a moment before answering weighs things in her mind and makes a decision
i used to bring over ten thousand at a time
thats the legal limit so i never brought more than that
how many trips did you make
with ten thousand
hes got that kinda money
its all in lock boxes in a mexico bank
but hes got a problem
hes what do you call it when you got money but dont have cash
hes cash poor
he kept on me till i finally said okay
ill bring whatever fits in a nine by twelve envelope
i got paid five hundred dollars and his friend mr
walker in mexico gave me the envelope
if you knew bringing anything over ten thousand was against the law why not pack a hundred grand
jackie gets exasperated
whatever it was had to fit in my bag and not hit you in the face if the bag was opened
this aint solvin my problem
i gotta figure out a way to either keep my job or get out of trouble
im of today but if i cant leave the country im out of a job
and if i dont got a job i cant hire a lawyer
they might give you permission
yeah if i cooperate
well jackie you got caught youre gonna have to give em something
but if all i can give em is ordells name i dont really know shit about what he does or how he does it that dont give me much to
give em what you got
offer to help
show a willingness to be helpful
you want to stay out of jail dont you
max looks at jackie thinking about something
i think maybe i have more options than i thought
sitting in his black mercedes parked across the street from jackies apartment building in hawthorne
johnny cash is playing inside his car
through the windshield he sees maxs powder blue cadillac seville pull up to jackies apartment
she gets out ten bends down and talks to him through the window of the passenger side door
then makes a goobye gesture and turns walking into her apartment complex
max drives off
while johnny cash continues crooning ordell puts on his gloves
then opens up his glovebox taking out a little targa
he steps out of the car slipping the pistol into his coat pocket
we stedicam in front of him as he walks across the street to jackies apartment
once inside the complex ordell passes us and we follow behind him up to jackies ground floor apartment door
he gives it a soft knock with one knuckle
he waits a moment then jackie opens the door
how you doing ms
i was expecting you
jackie holds the door open for him
ordell steps inside
he moves over by a halogen lamp in the living room
you got some booze
jackie still standing by the door
she doesnt look frightened
i got some vodka in the freezer
got some o
ordell turns the halogen lamp to dim
well then why dont you be a good hostess and make me a screwdriver
jackie moves into the kitchen area
ordell follows her hanging in the doorway while she makes the drink
jackie doesnt turn on the light
you gonna thank me
taking a glass from the cupboard
who you think got your ass outta jail
opening the freezer and filling a glass with ice cubes and taking out vodka
the same guy who put me in thanks a lot
hey you get caught with blow thats our business
opens refrigerator light cuts into the kitchen
she takes out orange juice then closes the door
it wasnt mine
ordell has to stop and think
jackie makes screwdriver
i bet it was that present mr
walker was sending melanie
yaaaah hes the one musta put it in there if you didnt
oh man that shits uncalled for baby and i apologize
i magine they asked you a shitload of questions about it huh
all that money want to know where you got it
jackie doesnt answer
she just walks up to ordell handing him his yellow drink in the darkness
ordell takes it continues to look at jackie
imagine they asked who you givin it to too
and what was your answer
i said i wanted to talk to a lawyer
you positive about that
you werent nervous and let something slip by mistake
if you did i aint mad i just gotta know
jackie says to his face youre not asking the right questions
then she walks past him back to the living room
she goes over to the halogen lamp turning the light up brighter then moves by the door still standing and looking at ordell in the kitchen doorway
i knew it
and they asked if i knew mr
ordell by the halogen lamp
he turns it back to dim
i didnt tell em anything
ordell moves slowly towards jackie
my name come up
jackie slowly shakes her head no
ordell directly in front of jackie he gently places his gloved hands on her shoulders
you say anything about me
jackie shakes her head no
well thats mighty honorable of you
ordells gloved fingertips move up her collarbone to her throat gently touching her skin
jackie locks eyes with his but still shows no fear
this fella beaumont they say what happened to him
they told me
at this moment the film becomes a on the right hand side is ordell with his hands barely touching jackies throat
on the left hand side is max driving home in his seville
max drives home an almost moony romantic look no his face
he cant stop thinking about jackie
during the night shed have a gleam in her eyes the look saying we could have fun
unless she was appraising kinda him with the look making a judgment and what it said was i could use you
either way it was a turn on
max pulls into the driveway of his small house in torrance
yeah somebody musta been real mad at beaumont
or they were afraid of what he might say to keep from doin some time
imagine from time to time they asked you a whole shitload of questions
and you didnt give em no answer
jackie shakes her head from side to side
ordell moves his thumbs from her collarbone to the middle of her throat
you scared of me
jackie shakes her head from side to side without her eyes leaving his
reaches over the seat you got a reason to be nervous with me
with his hands on jackies throat staring into the womans eyes from below frame then feels something hard the fuck against his crotch
neither break eye contact
ordell hears a click
cant believe it
max takes his keys then to the glove box
the gun is gone
where is it
is that what i think it is
what do you think it is
i think its a gun pressing against my dick
you thought right
now take your hands from around my throat nigga
ordell flashes his hustlers smile and lets go
jackie turns ordell around gun firmly in his back and pushes him against the wall
what the hell you doin
shut your ass up and grab the wall
jackie has ordell against the wall and is frisking him the way a cop would
she finds the
pistol in his pocket now baby thats got nothin to do with you
i just carry that
you been listenin to them cops too much
the cops didnt try and strangle my ass
damn jackie i was just playin with you
well i aint playin with you
im gonna unload both these motherfuckers you dont do what i tell you
understand what im saying
baby i aint come here she shoves both guns in ordells back
i said you understand what im saying i understand woman damn
go sit over in that chair
ordell moves over to a chair across from the couch
ordell still tries bullshit
im tellin you those cops been fuckin wit your mind
they turn black against black thats how they do
shut your raggedy ass up and sit down
put both hands behind our head
this shits gettin silly now
jackie turns the halogen lamp to light
i gotta tell you to shut up one more time im gonna shut you up
jackie sits down on the couch holding a gun in each hand both pointed dead at ordell
a coffee table lays between them
ordell hands behind his head continues to mumble
i just came here to talk
way i see it me and you only got one thing to talk about
what you willing to do for me
ordell looks at her a moment and says well i can get you a good lawyer jackie shakes her head no
lets get realistic baby
sooner or later theyre gonna get around to offering me a plea deal and you know that
thats why you came here to kill me
baby i didnt its okay
i forgive you
now lets say if i tell on you i walk
and if i dont i go to jail
ordell very interested
one hundred thousand put in an escrow account in my name if im convicted up to a year or put on probation
if i have to do more than a year you pay another hundred thousand
ordell just takes in what the woman said
i got a problem
all your moneys in mexico
ordell has to smile at the woman
i been thinkin about that too and i got me a idea
ordell goes through frame out the door jackie steps into frame and talks with him
ill talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if its on
talk to you tomorrow
jackie shuts the door and leaves frame
we hear a knock knock on the door
except its day
jackie in a bathrobe steps into frame and opens the door
she says to the yet unseen by camera visitor you want your gun dont you
ill go get it
she leaves frame and max enters it closing the door behind him
max stands by the door a little surprised and a touch pissed at the nonchalantness
as he stands on the threshold to her living room waiting for her to return with the gun feeling foolish he thinks about hauling her ass back to the stockade
thatll change her expression hed bet
she returns from the bedroom gun in hand wearing a sort of sad smile
max im sorry
i was afraid if i asked to borrow it youd say no
youd have to
would you like some coffee
then as quickly as the anger rose in max it dissipates completely leaving only curiosity
if youre having some
have a seat
jackie head to the kitchen making the coffee
max sits at the dining table off of the kitchen
you get a chance to use it
i felt a lot safer having it
my milk went bad when i was in jail
she puts a finger in the coffeemaker and starts scooping coffee in it
you want to hang on to it awhile
it wouldnt be legal but if it makes jackie goes to the sink filling the coffee pot
thanks but i have my own now
you went out this morning and bought a gun
she turns off the water
what i couldnt hear you
you went out this morning and bought a gun
pouring water into the coffee machine
lets just say i got one okay
she turns on the coffeemaker
somebody loan it to you
jackie leaves the kitchen
maxs eyes follow her to the living room
want to hear some music
jackie ends her knees and goes through a stack of records leaned up against the wall on the floor
i couldnt wait till i got home last night and wash my hair
it looks nice
she finds a record takes it out of the pile removes the album from the sleeve and places it on her stereo turntable
you never got into the whole cd revolution
i got a few
but i cant afford to start all over again
i got too much time and money invested in my records
the song starts its an old romantic soul music number from the early seventies
yeah but you cant get new stuff on records
jackie picks up her cigarettes off the coffee table
i dont buy new stuff that often
jackie enters the kitchen door frame by max
she lights a cigarette and stands
max listens to the soul song
this is pretty
who is this
they listen for a moment
i called in sick this morning
as far as the airline knows im still available
i dont know yet
m going to talk with dargus and nicolet today
do what you suggested
offer to help and see what happens
what i meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you
i want to talk to them first
i know more now about ordells money
well if the a
guy is the one who wants you thatll only interest him up to a point
its a lot of money
about a half a million dollars
all of it in cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin in
howd you find that out
he told me last night
he called you
he came by
whatd you do
jackie goes back in the kitchen
coffees almost there but not quite
she pulls down two mugs from a cabinet
he had his doubts at first
but hes always trusted me an wants more than anything to believe he still can
he needs me
without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in cabo
theres gotta be other ways to get it out
she pours the coffee
maybe but m the only one hes ever used
he cant trust his other people
he can try bringing i in himself but ordell sure dont want to go through no customs line
either he recruits another cabo stewardess or he continues to trust me
i made him feel he still can
jackie walks to the table with the two coffee mugs and sits down
how do you get it out
same way i been don but first they got to let me go back to work
youre gonna offer to set him up
if i get let off
otherwise fuck em
its very possible ordells killed somebody
i aint goin to jail and i aint doin that probation thing again
max watches her a moment jackie takes a drink of coffee
how do you feel about getting old
youre not old
you look great
im asking how you feel
does it bother you
its not really something i think about
okay im a little sensitive about my hair
it started falling out ten years ago
so i did something about it
howd you feel about it
im fine with it or i wouldnt of done it i did it to feel better about myself and i do
when i look in the mirror it looks like me
its different with men
you know i cant really feel too sorry for you in that department
in fact id make a bet that except possibly for an afro you look exactly the same as you did at twenty nine
jackie smiles into her coffee
my ass aint the same
nothin wrong with that
jackies smile grows bigger
does something else worry you
i just feel like im always starting over
you said how many bonds you wrote
well ive flown seven million miles
and ive been waitin on people almost twenty years
the best job i could get after my bust was cabo air which is about the worst job you can get in this industry
i make about sixteen thousand with retirement benefits aint worth a damn
and now with this arrest hanging over my head im scared
if i lose my job i gotta start all over again but i got nothin to start over with
ill be stuck with whatever i can get
and that scares me more than ordell
man ray nicolet moves down the hallway of the big building
ten heads for the office of mark dargus
he reaches the closed door
raps on it
nicolet opens the door revealing dargus and jackie brown sitting in the office talking
great youre here
dargus stands up and says to jackie let me have a word outside with agent nicolet for a moment
take your time
well just be a minute

the two detectives step outside and close the door on jackie as she pulls out her cigarettes
whats going on

she almost sounds scared
whats she want
she wants to go back to work
whats she willing to give us

and in exchange for my help i need permission to leave the country and immunity
you dont want much do you
can you do it or not
the two cops look at each other
to nicolet its your call
nicolet looks at jackie
helmut berger slaps a woman in the face with a newspaper proclaiming hes the mad dog
the film is an italian policier from the seventies
melanie sits in a comfy chair long ways bare legs hanging over the arm
as she watches the tv she picks up a big bong with its own handle
he takes a hit
melanies dressed in her usual melanie uniform of shorts and a loose top
the front door opens and ordell and louis walk through it carrying shopping bags
we notice that louis is sportin new duds
louis new look is a retro seventies style bowling shirt and black jeans
melanie notices the change
hey hey hey

ordell notices the bong in her hand and the smoke in the air

louis sits on the couch
he smiles at the comeback
ha ha ha

melanie and louis laugh
the phone rings

he moves towards the phone to melanie oh thats okay ill get it
he picks it up
pause hey jackie
throwing a hard look at melanie no jackie i didnt get your message

ordell gives her a silence gesture and look
melanie trades a look with louis like im in trouble all the while smiling like a shark
louis smiles to himself
melanie holds up the bong offering him a hit
ordells on the phone
no not on the phone lets meet somewhere

louis exhales his smoke does an older man cough

coughing opens up the capillaries
when you cough youre getting air in this case smoke to parts of the lung that dont normally get used

ordell hangs up the phone
to louis hey louis i have to go out awhile

louis with a smile

ordell takes the remote control and turns the station till he finds a channel with cartoons
so you just watch this for the next three hours and ill be back

i get high at night

melanie climbs out of the chair and walks ordell to the door ordell says to her in the doorway hope you dont mind keeping him company
try not to rip his clothes off em theyre new
melanie gives him a sarcastic oh youre so funny look
ordell kisses her quick on the mouth then says past her ill be back in an hour man

ordell leaves and melanie closes the door
she turns around and looks at louis
want a metrix
whats a metrix
she crosses to the kitchen
its like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big meal
its a diet thing
no its what body builders drink to beef up
she goes into the kitchen and starts making her metrix shake
he looks around and spots something interesting
in a clear plastic frame
melanie circa at about sixteen wearing roller disco skates
melanie in a green setting about five years ago wearing a pretty oriental style dress with a smile for the camera look on her face
the photo was obviously a picture of melanie with somebody else thats been cut in half
somebodys disembodied arm still rests on her shoulder
louis picks up the photo frame
how old were you here
she looks and sees what hes talking about
the roller disco one
louis walks over
youre fourteen years old here
i thought you were sixteen
i was pretty much the same height now as i was then
were you a disco girl
noooo i was a surfer girl
besides i was only fourteen
i couldnt go to discos
so where did you go
or get high drop acid at a friends place
i was a k

she hits whip on her blender
it makes an infernal noise till she hits stop
carrying the blender full of metrix she walks over and looks at the picture
that was taken at a place called flippers
it was in hollywood

where were you
we had done time together already
melanie drinks her metrix
were you a disco guy
cmon dont lie
i dont like dancing

during that whole scene i just drank in bars
he points to the cut picture who didnt make the cut

whos arm is that
thats the guy i lived with
his name was

i never got to know him really
i couldnt speak japanese and his english was terrible
but i couldnt say anything because his english was better than my japanese
that sounds like a problem
we didnt have much to say to each other anyway
i never got to know him that well but i knew enough to know i wasnt missing much
i keep that because of all the fuckin time i was there thats the only picture i got of me in japan
she points beyond her shoulder thats japan
melanie looks up at louis
lies on the couch on his back and melanie sits on top of him
theyre going at it like a couple of fuck monkeys
almost on the fade up louis cums
that was fun
she hops off and out of frame
yeah that really hit the spot
now thats over lets get to know each other
closeup a rack of cds all beginning with d are flipped through till it stops on one cd the best of the max is standing in he soul music section
o a music store
he lifts out the cd and turns it over
it has the song jackie played this morning
he smiles and takes the cd up to the register
closeup the cockatoo inn neon sign unlit during the day
ordell walks into the dark red cocktail lounge in the middle of the day and sees jackie sitting at the bar drinking a white wine
old school soul plays on the jukebox
he sits next to her
i gotta remember this place
this is all right
two minutes from your crib ten minutes from your work
a black bartender named floyd approaches ordell
whats your drink brother
to jackie how you doin
yes you are
floyd makes ordells drink
i bet you come here on a saturday night you need nigga repellent keep em off your ass
i do okay

i bet you do a damn sight better than okay
you think anybody followed you
i dont think so but it dont really matter
they know im meeting you
how the fuck they know that
i told them
floyd comes back with ordells screwdriver
three twenty five
ordell digs in his pocket and gives floyd a five
thank you sir
to jackie you told em
you told em its me
they already know its you
that dont mean you gotta confirm it
look the only way i can get permission to fly is if i agree to help them
which is what i have to appear to be doing
so i give them something they already know
didja tell em anything else
i told them you got a half a million dollars in mexico and you want me to bring it here
you told them that
its true isnt it
what the fucks that got to do with it
they know im delivering for you
i mention the half million they dont give a fuck about that they want you with guns
so i say well if you want proof hes getting paid for selling them let me bring the money in
what did they say
they both slap palms
closeup louis taking a hit off melanies bong
louis and melanie are back in the living room kicking back taking bong hits
as louis gets his hit melanie talks so first he tries to get into the cocaine business but realizes right away that shits too competitive
piss the wrong person off you get shot
so he says fuck that moves over to guns
you can sell guns wherever theres a demand
no one gives a shit
he acts like hes this big international arms dealer when come on the only people he ever sold to were dopers
louis finishes his hit and slides the bong back across the coffee table to melanie
he seems to be making out
referring to the bong
is it dead
she starts preparing a bowl
well so far he is
but you have to admit hes not too bright
i wouldnt go so far as to say that
melanie still preparing her bowl
he moves his lips when he reads what does that tell ya
lets say hes streetwise
ill give im that
hes still a fuck up
she takes a major bong hit
holds in the smoke
then while holding in the smoke says he killed a man worked for him the other night
so what are you trying to tell me
i should get out of here
melanie lets out her stream of smoke and flashes her shark smile
thats not what im saying at all
pause you know where he went
he went to meet that stewardess
does that bother you
melanie lets out a sarcastic laugh
you live with him
i live here
he drops in and out
he tell you about that half million dollars hes got in mexico
course he did he tells everybody wholl listen
thats what hes doin with this stewardess
hes scheming how he can get it over here
and your point is
let him and that stewardess get that money over here
and just take it from him
jackie explaining the plan to ordell
i make two deliveries
the first one with ten thousand like a dry run
they watch it
see how it works
then we do a second delivery when i bring in the half mill
naw naw thats too much exposure
i aint goin anywhere near that money
you dont have to
i told em youre real careful
you never pick up money yourself
you always send someone and i never know who it is
thats a good idea
if you just listen youll see its a damn good idea
the first time i do it theyre lurking about
they see me hand the ten thousand to someone
i dont know
one of your friends
if you want
yeah i think a woman
the next trip when i come with all the money itll look like i hand it to the same one i did before
but you dont
no i give it to someone else first
and they follow the wrong one thinkin shes bringing it to me
thats the idea
so we need two people two women
can you cover that
i got the woman covered
where you thinkin about doin this
i was thinkin the del amo mall
in the food court
i suppose you see a piece of this for yourself
well its my plan
were in this together
yeah but its my money and i dont need me a partner
i aint your partner im your manager
im managing to get your money out of mexico into america in your hands and im managing to do all this under the nose of the cops
that makes me your manager and managers get fifteen percent
managers get ten percent
thats an agent
managers get fifteen percent
ill give ya ten
plus the same deal as before
i can do that
they clink their glasses together
it flips to p
its now getting late at night
jackie comes home
shes dressed differently than she was at the cockatoo
in fact she looks like shes coming home from a date
she walks into her bedroom
kicks off her shoes
takes her earring off putting them on the night stand by the bed
she sees that her answering machine is flashing
she hits play
we begin a slow zoom into the answering machine
never seeing jackie again
the machine voice says you have on message
sent at maxs voice comes out of the machine
i was just calling to find out how everything went today with a
if you want to call me my home number is or you can reach me at my office which is b a i l
thats also on the card i gave you when we first met i dont know if you still have that but its on it oh let me give you my
okay so ill talk to you later
hope everythings well
end of message
we se the huge del amo mall from the parking area
a subtitle reads the del amo mall on a lazy midday in the middle of the week
a few people mostly black mill around but its not like it is on the weekend
the international food court where fast food versions of international cuisine are available to all the hungry del amo mall shoppers
jackie and ordell sit at a table in the food court
she drinks an iced tea from teriyaki donut
a collection of broadway shopping bags sit on the table
we join in mid conversation
the moneys in a broadway shopping bag
i get some food and sit down here in the food court
then your girl comes you got somebody yet
whatd you care
look its my ass facin the penitentiary
you send some hard headed roc whore and she fucks things up
i aint gonna send no roc whore
the womans cool i promise
were outside the del amo ua cinemas a six screen theater thats been in the del amo mall since the early seventies
a small afternoon crowd is exiting the cinema having just watched their matinee
max cherry is among them
he exits the theater and strolls through the mall
in the food court
ordell rises from the table
jackie moves a broadway bag towards him
dont forget your bag
he takes it
we follow with ordell out of the food court when he stops
he see max cherry strolling through the mall
ordell almost steps into a store to get out of view
what the fuck is max cherry doing here
as ordell watches he sees max head towards the food court
walks into the food court
he stands looking a all the international fast food choices in front of him
as he tries to decide he hears from behind him max
max turns and sees jackie siting there drinking her iced tea smoking her mild seven and smiling up at him
max smiles back
he approaches her table
i walked right past you
i know ignoring me
whatre you up to
catching a movie
whatd ya see
american prseident how was it
me and annette bening are goin steady
oh are you
does she know that
sitting down at the table i dont believe shes ever heard of me
but that doesnt mean were not going steady
watching max sit down and make himself comfortable at jackies table
to himself whats up with this shit
i think falling in live with movie stars is something that happens to a man as he gets older
does it happen to all men
well id never be so bold as to speak for all men but as or myself and a few of my friends thats definitely the case
theres a lot of actresses out there you like and theres some you have crushes on
but theres always one who you love
and with her its sorta like going steady
and annettes it for you
these relationships never last too long
with a smile on her face thats a goddam man for ya
cant even be faithful to a fuckin movie star
who was your girl before annette
you know her
yeah shes the girl who drove the bus in speed
but i had to end it
im old enough to be her father
how olds annette
i dont care
gesturing to the broadway bags on the table
whatre you a bag lady
i go back to work tomorrow
you talk them into it
they seem to like the idea
bring the money in and they follow it
yea but im going to dress it up
put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone i meet here
you dont actually do it that way
he always just picked it up at my place
but with a
involved i want to stage it
you know make it look more intriguing like we know what the fuck were doin
then its up to ray nicolet the a
guy to follow the shopping bag
make the delivery somewhere in the mall
right around here in the food court
sit down leave the bag under the table
jackie nods her head yes
will ordell go for that
im helping him bring his money into america
he loves the idea
you just missed him
he was here
yeah we were goin over everything
thats why all the bags
i called you last night
i know i got your message
ray wanted to have dinner
he wanted to talk about the sting were plotting
thats what he calls it
hes being real nice to me
you think hes got a thing for you
but im thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself
i dont follow your logic
what does his being nice to you have to do with him wanting ordells money
hes setting me up to make a proposition
you dont propose something like that unless youre pretty sure the other persons into it
has he hinted around
but i knew this narcotics cop one time
told me that in a raid the whole package never gets back to the station
his exact words
you know some interesting people
we werent bullshittin either cause later he was suspended and forced to retire
has nicolet told you any colorful stories like that
she shakes her head no
he tries to act cool
no harm in that
hes a young guy havin fun being a cop
i know the type trust me on this
hes more interested in ordell than the money
if hes gonna do anything suspect itll be cutting corners to get the conviction but he wouldnt walk off with the money
what about you max
if i was in nicolets place
no i mean you right now
not it you were somebody else
if i saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money would i take it
you know where it came from
its not like its anybodys life savings
it wouldnt even be missed
a half a million dollars will always be missed
youre avoiding the question
i might be tempted
especially now since im getting out of the bail bonds business
jackie looks at him wow that was a statement but she doesnt say anything
i have to stand behind all my active bonds but im not writing any new ones
a lot of reasons
but the main one would be im tired of it
when did you decide
its been a long time coming
i finally made up my mind i guess it was thursday
with a date on it
jackies hand is signing her name
we whip up and se her face just as max cherry approaches her handing her his business card
hi im max cherry
your bail bondsman
the day you got me out of jail
yeah that night i went to pick up a guy
i hear hes staying at this house so i sneak in wait for him to come home
wait a minute
after we were together you went and snuck into a guys house
max is dropping off jackie at her apartment and saying goodbye
i dropped you off
max finding no gun in his glove box
went to my office found out you took my gun
max in his office taking another pistol from his drawer and a stun gun
got another gun and a stun gun
and went to this guys house in el monte and i waited for him
what do you do when he comes home
shoot him with the stun gun
while hes incapacitated cuff him take em to county
you do that
thats my job
did you do it that night
he never came home
but im sitting on the couch in the dark holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew so after a couple hours i think what am i
nineteen years of this shit
so i made up my mind thats it
and is that it
more or less
jackie takes a pause before saying im not sure you answered my question
if you had a chance unemployed now to walk off with a half million dollars would you take it
i believe i said id be tempted
jackie smiles at him behind cigarette smoke
dont even think about it
you could get yourself killed go to prison
what if ive figured a way
hold for a few beats then
over this card we hear an airplane landing
back at work standing at the exit of her plane
all the passengers are filtering out
she says goodbye
goodbye bye bye
goodbye jackie wearing her stewardess uniform walks into the lax parking structure pulling her bad on wheels behind her
nicolet and dargus are waiting for her
we gotta stop meeting this way
they all fall in step towards jackies honda
the two cops and the black woman sit parked in her honda
she behind the wheel nicolet next to her in the passenger seat dargus in the backseat
nicolet has the flight bag in his lap
hes taking out the manila envelope with the ten thousand inside
their demeanor is very different from the first time they met
the three now almost act like friends
how was your flight
bet youre happy to be working again
this is a
agent ray nicolet jackie brown ordell robbie money exchange trial run
its three p
the location is the parking structure at lax
what are you doing
pointing to a small mike on his lapel
im recording this
i thought you were going to let this one through
dont worry about it
every step of this goes in my report
back to report voice i am now taking a manila envelope from the subjects flight bag
he opens it and takes out the ten thousand dollars
the envelope contains currency
all the same denomination one hundred dollar bills
now im counting it
what time do you have to be there
im meeting a woman
whats her name
he wouldnt say
you gonna follow her
she leaves somebodyll be on her
but youre not going to stop her
nicolet finishes counting then hushes them up
the envelope contains ten thousand dollars
the subject will be delivering the currency in a
a broadway shopping bag
she holds it up
a broadway shopping bag
a large bag with handles and brown lettering
the huge del amo mall
the del amo mall on another lazy midday in the middle of the week
max rides up an escalator in the mall
he casually strolls through the mall goes into a cappuccino bar called busta cap across from the food court
walking up to the counter cafs mocha
you want whipped cream on that
max checks his watch
he looks over at the food court and spots jackie sitting at a table by herself
jackie on the phone with max dressed for bed long t shirt and panties
think of it as money that shouldnt even be here
i mean does anybody have a right to it
max in his office on the phone
it may be evidence once they get their hands on it but right now its only money
he ponders his words as he watches her from a distance
jackie sits at a table by herself eating japanese food from teriyaki donut and drinking an iced tea
as she eats she hears is this seat taken
jackie looks up and sees a skinny young girl black quite pretty no older than twenty
she holds a tray filled with tacos enchiladas rice and beans and a giant sized coke
she also has a broadway shopping bag hanging from her arm
have a seat
the young girl does
jackie looks at her tray of food
it would seem our young girls from the south
put your bag on the floor okay
under the table right next to mine
the young girl who hasnt looked right at jackie since sitting down bends sideways to glance under the table
then when i leave well you know
whats your name
she looks up
then back down at her tray
go ahead start eating
sheronda starts eating head down hunching close to the tray
would it bother you if i smoked
without raising her head she shakes it from side to side
jackie takes out a pack of davidoffs and lights one up with her yellow bic
as she does this she observes sheronda eating
sheronda can i ask you a question
are you and ordell married
without raising her head
he say we like the same thing as married
do you live together
sheronda hesitates then says without raising her head
most of the times
not every day
sheronda looks up at her
sometimes every day for a while
then you dont see him for a few days
she looks back down
you know whats in the bag youre taking
he say is a surprise
well sheronda it was nice talking to you
jackie picks up sherondas bag and leaves
max drinking his cafs mocha sans whipped cream watches jackie leave the young girl and with broadway bag in hand walk out of the food court
max watches her walk down the mall when two young men in sport coats jeans and cowboy boots step out of a b
dalton bookstore stop her and begin talking
knowing they must be nicolet and dargus he watches one of them take the broadway bag from jackie and look inside
they talk for a minute it would seem about nothing too serious
jackie nods her head listens to the two cops nods her head again and then walks off
as he watches her walk away from the cops
you said it yourself
ray wants ordell he dont give a shit about the money
money wont convict him guns will
yeah sure if it falls in their lap they take it
if they know they got it theyll look for it
but if they dont
max watches the two cops turn their attention to the young girl eating in the food court
max watches her too
the young girl continues to work her way through her mexican food when she turns her head to an older black woman sitting at the next table
the older woman says something and the younger woman hands her the ashtray jackie was using
max watches the young girl finish her food and get up from the table
she stoops down to get the broadway shopping bag and walks out of the food court
max watches nicolet and dargus let the young girl get a little ahead then follow after her
max turns back on the older woman all alone
she finishes the coffee she was drinking and stands up carrying how about that
a broadway shopping bag
the woman heads out of the mall
max follows her
the older woman walks past us
she heads straight for the exit
max follows the woman outside
she walks down a line of cars then gets in a big tan mercury sedan
she drives of
but not before max writes down her license plate number
thats what you do to go through with the shit you start
i can do this max i know i can
but i cant do it without you
max climbs into his seville starts her up and drives out of the parking lot
driving down the street lost in thought
to himself it could work
if she handles the cops right i could work
he hits play on the dash cd player
the delfonics fill the cab of the caddy
a garage door is lifted open revealing ordell and louis
ordell and louis are at mr
robbies storage facility
a van is backed up nect to the opening
the facility is pitch black
ordell ahs a big flashlight in his hand

he turns on the flashlight
he shines the beam into darkness
we see the facility is filled to the gills with machine guns shotguns uzis a rocket launcher and handguns of many types

extreme closeup jackies finger presses a small black button next to the handwritten name m
coming out of it what
bends down to talk in the speaker
jackie walks down the hallway and finds the door
she rings the doorbell
the door opens she sees melanie for the first time on the other side
melanie dressed in a t shirt cut offs doesnt say a word just turns around and walks away
once melanie leaves she sees ordell standing inside the apartment screwdriver in hand yelling after melanie now shes gonna pout
he turns his attention to jackie
hey jackie cmon in
jackie steps inside
she sees louis for the first time sitting on the couch

melanie comes out of the bedroom with her sunglasses sandals bag strung across her shoulders and her keys in her hand
she makes a bee line towards the door without saying nothin to nobody

the door slams behind her
ordell looks to jackie raises his screwdriver and says drink

louis gets up to make the call
ordell turns back to jackie and smiles holding up his screwdriver
im about ready for a refill

louis sits with them on the phone silent
nicolet and dargus stop me at the airport and mark the bills

wanda goes away
jackie and melanie sit at the bar
the music is loud and they have to talk over it
melanie moves her head to it during the conversation
how long you been with ordell
almost a year
ive known him forever
what were you two fighting about
he told me to go outside
imitating ordells voice you may leave us now
its all part of his pathetic attempt to be the man
you know mr
walker dont you
jackie nods yes
walkers my buddy
ask him about ordell
that coke was yours wasnt it
melanie makes a face to show pain
oh man listen
im sorry about that
i hope they dont come down on you on my account
ordell shoulda told you it was in your bag
wanda brings the drinks
melanie digs in her purse for the money
he said he didnt know about it
digging in her purse you believe that
yeah well i guess you have to trust him
pulls out a ten id have second thoughts on that but then i know em
melanie takes her jaeger shot lets it go down then continues
he killed a guy who works for him the other day
you already knew that
so tell me
having all that money in your flight bag is it tempting
jackie nods yes as she sips her beer
i tell you
if ordell ever sent me to carry in ten thousand dollars that would be the last motherfuckin time he saw me
the next trip youre gonna have over half a million
if you thought of cutting ordell out i sure as hell wouldnt blame you
you think im kidding
you know how easy it would be
he wont be anywhere near that mall
pull one more switch up front
half a million dollars
smiling keep it between us girls
whats that fucker ever done for us
getting off the barstool i dont think so but thanks for the beer
watches her go
softly under her breath chicken shit
jackie and nicolet sit at a steakhouse eating a steak dinner
nicolet drinks beer jackie drinks white wine
ordell has a white guy working for him named louis
you two meet
this afternoon before i came here
he was with ordell at an apartment in hermosa beach
i dont know if he lives there but i can find out
you talk to him
his full name is louis gara
he just got out from serving four years in susanville
do you know what he does for ordell
i imagine shit needs to be done
weve been following mr
gara and hes definitely working for ordell
in a car parked on surveillance
louis with the van at the storage facility
they served two years together almost twenty years ago in soledad
but he doesnt live in hermosa beach
ordells got him staying at a house in
the older woman in the mall
compton with a fifty six year old petty thief woman named simone hawkins
ever meet her or they talk about her
whos the other one
white girl named melanie ralston
another girlfriend of ordells
whats her story
it was her coke i got busted with
she knows everything but shes not part of it and shes pissed cause shes not part of it
ordell wouldnt even let her stay at the meeting
she tried to talk me into ripping off ordell
and splittin with her
im sure that was the idea
what did you say
i smiled and walked away
she also told me ordell killed beaumont
she told you that
was she there
she didnt say
but she mentioned beaumont by name
well this sounds like a lady id like to have a word with
so everythings set for tomorrow
everythings the same except one change
max sits on the couch in jackies apartment drinking white wine
jackie paces in front of him white wine in one hand davidoff in the other going over the details of tomorrow
one could notice a slight change in jackie
theres a bit of an edge to miss brown thats bubbling underneath her cool surface
after all shes been the architect of this half a million dollars switcheroo
shes moved heaven and earth to make all the pieces fall into place and all the players thnk what she wants them to think
as she talks to max she knows tomorrow all her hard work will either fail or succeed
but dont take this difference the wrong way
this edge im referring to is not one born out of fear jackies nervous but shes not afraid
its more the edge an athlete might feel before an all important competition
i told them ordells changed the amount hes bringing in
do you think they bought it
i got them thinking ordells real nervous
they love thinking hes scared of them
you know a good cop wont let you know he knows youre fulla shit
all he needed was a reasonable explanation
everythings the same except one change
ordell thinks its just too hot right now to bring in all his money
he knows youre watching him and hes paranoid
hes keeping his stash where it is but he wants to bring in fifty thousand for bail in case he needs it
itll be more than that
dont be so literal
ray believed it
but you still have to show him the money at the airport
well you know im not going to show him the whole amount
hell see fifty thousand
wheres the rest of it
in the bag underneath
what if he checks it
he wont i mean he didnt the last time
hell be expecting fifty thousand and there it is on top
youre takin a helluva chance kid
if he finds it i say mr
walker put the money in and i didnt know nothing about it
like the coke
then youre out and you get nothing
yeah but im not in jail and i tried
youre gonna have surveillance all over you
thats why you dont make a move till i come out of the fitting room
in a dress
well a suit
theres one i had my eye on
the phone rings
extreme closeup ordell on the phone its ordell
we got a bit of a change in plans here
nothing to worry bout everythings the same except for one change
that bitch you saw in the mall simone
she wasnt here today cause she split on me
pause me an louis went over to her place shes gone
shes gone and all her shits gone and sos my ten thousand dollars
pause it aint nothin to worry about girl
everythings just like we discussed
except when you do the switch instead of simone its gonna be melanie
melanie is lying on the couch sprawled out like a cat
louis sits at the other end of the couch
theyre watching dirty mary and crazy larry on tv
peter fonda and susan george make jokes as theyre pursued by police cars
they can hear ordell on the phone
melanie smiling at louis flirtatiously and conspiratorially lifts her bare foot and rubs his arm with it
louis turns to her and gives her a look that says im not on your side bitch
so knock it of
melanie sees this and takes her foot away
louis turns back to the television
looks at louis for a moment then sighs saying under her breath chicken shit
with mexico and california on it
on the mexico side we see cabo san lucas with a big circle around it
on the california side we see lax in a similar circle
the tiny figure of a black airplane appears in the cabo circle
with appropriate sound effects it takes off from cabo flying towards lax leaving a dotted line behind it
the camera moves into a closeup of the little black airplane
rearranging her bag
the five hundred thousand inside takes up half the space
she tucks lingerie around the edges covers the money with blouses shoes and skirts and ties i all down tight
then places a fat envelope with fifty thousand right on top
jackie steps out of the bathroom walks down the aisle and is stopped by a passenger
listen miss im waiting for a drink and you spend half the fuckin flight in the can
soon as we land im making a formal complaint
why because i called you an asshole
you didnt call me that
oh well youre an asshole
jackie steps into the lax parking structure pulling her bag on wheels behind her
waiting for her is ray nicolet
we have to stop meeting like this
they fall into step towards her car
you said that the last time
well its true isnt it
after his is buttoned up we could meet someplace else
what do you think
we could if im not in jail
oh thats taken care of
i called the state attorneys office
you were no filed this morning in circuit court
this information stops jackie in her tracks
are you saying im off the hook
nicolet who kept walking when jackie stopped looks back at jackie
free as a bird
i still expect you to finish the job though
how much do you have this time
jackie starts walking again fifty thousand like i said
hes pretty sure hes gonna need it for bail
jackie and nicolet in the parked car
ray has the flight bag in his lap
he unzips it
he sees the clothes with the envelope on top
jackie watches all of this
thats fifty thousand huh
it doesnt look like that much
i was told ten thousand in each pack
you didnt count it
i never have
its not my money
he puts the envelope back in the bag and feels through the folds of a skirt
he might have slipped some coke in here
did you check
walker promised hed never do that again
nicolets fingers move to a pair of black heels wedged into the side
they touch the shoes
then move over to the envelope opens the clasp and takes out five rubber banded bond packets of loot
ever been tempted
to put one of these in my pocket
if i did id have to give you one wouldnt i
or we could take what we want
no one knows how much there is except us right
all those things are true
after all it dont belong to nobody right
that would be one point of view
yeah well its not a point of view that a
once we make it evidence it belongs to us
you are now officially out of trouble
dont do nothing stupid now
how can i do anything if im being watched every second
im glad you realize that
saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you
holding up the money put this in your shopping bag
its what i expect to find when i look in sherondas
max cherry sits behind his desk
winston powell the big black guy from the photo is at the other desk on the phone
max looks at his watch
max stands up takes the sport coat from the back of his chair putsit on and walks over to winstons desk
winston still on the phone looks up

winston goes back to the phone
max walks out of the office
sams hoffin braur german for beer garden is a strip joint bar in downtown l
ordells on the pay phone
a stripper strips in the b
what the fuck are you two still doing there
louis stands in the empty living room talking to ordell on the phone
kate bush plays in the b
i was ready to leave ten minutes ago
ordell snaps at louis not so harsh louis is forced to retaliate but enough to express his loss of patience
well you the one in motherfuckin charge
well she keeps saying in a minute
go in there snatch her by the hair and drag her big ass out
this is my goddam money were talking about
get your ass out the door
he hangs up on louis
louis pissed at being hung up on and talked to like that hangs up the phone and turns his frustration where it rightly belongs melanie
louis stomps towards the bedroom where the musics playing
were leaving now
all right already
we see a montage of the individual characters in route to the mall
in her honda smoking a cigarette looking cool as usual driving to the mall
her car plays seventies soul
in his cadillac seville cruising down hawthorne boulevard to the mall
he plays hid delfonics cd
in melanies toyota drive towards the mall
melanie drives singing along with kate bush on her car stereo
jackies car pulls up to a lined parking space in the parking lot
jackie gets out of the honda with her flight bag
she goes to her hatchback takes a robinsons may bag lines the first half of the bag with old paperbacks
then takes out of the flight bag the envelope with the fifty thousand marked dollars takes one packet of ten thousand and puts it in her pocket
she lines the envelope with forty thousand across the books then fills the rest of the bag with beach towels
then with her flight bag slung over her shoulder carrying the robinsons may bag and with all the confidence of a world champion prize fighter going into the ring she
strides toward the hugs mall
jackie enters the mall
she looks at the people buzzing around
any one of them could be surveillance
she calmly walks down the mall then turns into the roinsons may store
jackie in her cabo air uniform walks up to a young asian saleswoman named amy in the robinsons may designer clothing area
the saleswoman smiles when she sees jackie
can i help you
yes you have a suit ive had my eye on
jackie steps out of the fitting room wearing a real sharp badass black suit with a white blouse
oh my god
you look so cool
jackie moves over to the mirror and checks herself out
this looks pretty good on me
are you kidding it looks great
you wear this to a business meeting youre the badass in the room
but you can go out dancing in this too
its a total power suit
jackie studies her reflection
i think im gonna just get this for today
im in kind of a hurry
would you mind ringing this up while i change out of it
not a problem
jackie walks into the fitting room
she walks down the fitting room hallway with changing cubicles on her right enters the last one
she closes the door and sits down on the bench in between her flight bag full of money and the robinsons may bag
a full length mirror is straight i front of her
she looks at herself
when someone comes into the stall next to her
melanies voice comes from the other side of the wall
are you getting that black suit
yeah do you like it
it looks good on you
do you got something for me
a robinsons may bag like jackies filled with towels comes sliding underneath the stall
jackie picks up her robinsons may bag filled with books towels and the marked forty thousand dollars
she takes the loose packet of ten thousand marked dollars and lies it on top of the bag
as she does all this melanie continues talking
we coulda worked this
you know that dontcha
you wouldve made out a lot better than youre going to believe me
jackie slides the robinsons may bag with money under the stall
melanie sees the money on top and stops talking
i put a little cherry on top
what the hell he ever do for us
now be careful with that bag
you dont want it ripping open on you in the middle of the store
we hear the sound of melanie leaving
jackie then transfers the half of a million dollars out of her flight bag into melanies robinsons may bag
she sticks her uniform in the flight bag
then takes the towels and puts them on top of the money
she grabs her flight bag and leaves leaving behind the robinsons may bag filled with half of a million dollars
jackie looking sharp in her new suit but acting a touch frantic and anxious walks rapidly toward the sales counter where amy waits for her
im sorry i just decided to stay in the suit get out of that damn uniform
oh thats not a problem
as jackie and the salesgirl complete their transaction the camera circles them slowly at first but more rapidly each go around
they complete the transaction and as jackie starts to leave she stops and says to amy oh somebody left a shopping bag in there
looks like beach towels
we follow her
jackie walks out of robinsons may hurriedly into the main mall
the calm cool stride were used to with jackie is completely gone
she stops looks around head darting from one direction to another
she looks in a panic
the camera begins to twirl around her
she seems to be looking for something she doesnt see
she looks helpless and on the verge of tears
as the twirling camera circles her she screams ray
i need you
she took the money
the camera stops twirling
nicolet dargus and two other plainclothes cops come running out of a store towards jackie
as they reach her a frantic jackie yells melanie burst in the dressing room and took the money
louis and melanie pull up to a lined parking space in melanies toyota
louis is the first out of the car
come on goddammit were late
we stedicam in front of them louis the rapid pacesetter pulling melanie behind him by the hand
melanie carries the robinsons may switch bag
jesus christ get a grip louis
we shoulda been there already and we woulda been if it hadnt been for your fuckin around
they go inside robinsons may
we stedicam into robisons may with them
we lose them for a moment behind racks of dresses and mannequins but end up landing on jackie in her black suit looking in a mirror and talking to amy
on the designer clothes floor
you wear this to a business meeting youre the badass in the room
we pan away and find louis and melanie by a dress rack watching jackie
thats a nice outfit on her
im gonna go over and look at this michi moon display
just stay right fuckin here all right
are you sweating
louis hand immediately goes to his forehead and touches dampness
job a little too much for you
louis shoots melanie a hard convict look
melanie smiles at him feeling the stare but too much of a natural born smart ass to change
ill be over here
youre too conspicuous
louis looks over at the fitting room
jackie is going inside it and the saleswoman is walking away towards him
he watches the saleswoman walk by him then looks back in time to see melanie enter the fitting room
under his breath goddammit not till i tell ya
he decides hes watching the fitting room entrance too much so he starts throwing his look around when he sees something that stops him cold
max is looking at dresses paying no attention to the fitting room
he thinks what the fuck is max cherry doing here
max doing what hes doing looks up and sees louis staring at him across the floor
max smiles and gives louis a wave before turning his back to him and continues to do what he was doing
he quickly looks around the store to see anything else any more surprise guests possible police surveillance
everything looks normal
the saleswoman is behind the register ringing up jackies purchase
the few customers there are doing customer stuff
then he sees melanie come out with a robinsons may bag and head down a different aisle
he hurries down his aisle and cuts her off
their whole fight is said tense and low
what are you doin
im getting out of here
what do you think
lemme have the bag
i can carry it
she tries to push past him and he catches her by her arm and pulls her around
gimme that bag watch it dipshit
you wanna rip the fuckin bag
gimme that bag before i knock you out and take it
melanie realizes louis aint fuckin kiddin
not only that this old guy looks close to buggin
she lets go of the bag
jesus whats wrong with you
he takes it
they start walking
we stedicam in front of them
im carrying it
okay you got it
just take a chill pill for christ sake
louis has had enough of her slang and says tensely through gritted teeth fuck you with your chill pill
in mid walk melanie asks him remember where we came in
louis stops dead
he looks around confused
like a teacher on romper room nooo thats towards sears
we came in through bullocks
i know where it is
want to follow me lou is
pissed he leaves frame
melanie wearing her melanie smirk follows behind
louis clutching the shopping bag close to his chest walks rapidly down an aisle of parked cars
melanie follows close behind
we stedicam alongside
we walk for awhile louis changes direction to another aisle
were now in front of him
we see he has a searching look on his face
you have no idea where you parked do you
louis doesnt answer
jesus but if you two arent the biggest fuck ups ive ever seen in my life
how did you ever rob a bank
when you robbed banks did you have to look for your car then too
no wonder you went to jail
louis could kill her right now
just take his gun out of his pants and shoot her in her snickering face
but instead of doing what he wants he does what he should
he doesnt answer of look back
if he looked back and saw that melanie smirk he couldnt e responsible for what happens
he changes directions cuts down another aisle and hopes for both their sakes she shuts the fuck up
but our melanie just keeps on being melanie
is it this aisle lou is
yeah down the end
they walk it its not it
louis changes direction and cuts between some cars to the next one
is it this aisle or the next one over
in between two cars louis spins on her
dont say anything else okay
im telling you keep your mouth shut
melanie was surprised by the spin but is about to say something anyway when louis put his hand up and says i mean it
dont say one fuckin word
okay lou is
that did it
louis whips out the beretta ordell gave him shoots her
in the belly
she bounces off one of the cars and goes down
louis shoots her again on the ground
one to make sure
two cause it felt good
then he hurries of for his car
we follow in front of him
he looks around then yells out see just where i fuckin said it was
he hops in the car and throws it into reverse
we can se melanies bare legs sticking out from a row of cars
louis stops the toyota alongside the dead melanie and yells through the passenger window hey look
i found it
he drives away
max cherrys cadillac seville pulls up to a lined space in the parking lot
max gets out of his car and casually strolls towards the del amo mall
max hands in pocket strolls unhurriedly through the robinsons may store
he walks around the store keeping one eye peeled toward the designer clothes section
he walks up to a jewelry counter and begins looking at he pieces in the display case when a pretty young salesgirl comes up to him
can i show you something
not right now
im just killing time waiting for my wife
but thanks anyway
if anything grabs you dont be shy
thanks i wont
she goes off
he looks towards designer clothes and sees jackie walking out of the fitting room wearing the cool black suit
oh my god
you look so cool
jackie moves over to the mirror and checks herself out
max looks back to the jewelry display case saying under his breath low and away we go
jackie looks at her reflection in the mirror
then she lifts her eyes meeting maxs across the room
max gives her a nod of his head to show he approves
jackie smiles and breaks contact turning to amy
we hear her say from a distance
this looks pretty good on me
max hears a commotion behind him and turns to see louis and melanie hurriedly making their way towards designer clothes
he turns his attention back to browsing through dresses on a rack
he sees louis and melanie squabbling
he sees jackie disappear into the fitting room
he sees amy leaving the fitting room entrance
he watches melanie by herself watch amy leave
melanie watches the fitting room for a few moments
gathering her courage then makes her move entering the fitting room
max smiles to himself so far so good he thinks
he throws a look towards louis only to see louis staring dead at him with an unhappy look on his face
max returns the look with a smile and a wave then turns his back on his before he can see a reaction
max continues his fake browsing
he sees melanie come out of the fitting room carrying a robinsons may bag close to her chest
she and louis disappear
he sees jackie come out of the fitting room go over to amy and buy the dress
jackie goes into her act acting agitated and distracted as she talks to amy pays with cash then leaves stopping to say oh somebody left a shopping bag in there
looks like beach towels
amy is left alone by the cashier counter
its maxs turn
as max looks at amy then at the fitting room entrance he says to himself max old boy
youve spent nineteen years dealing with people who take incredible risks
you walk over to that counter youre gonna find out what its like
max takes a few moments
then walks over to amy
excuse me but my wife thinks she left a bag of beach towels in the fitting room
yeah i think theyre back there
go get em
theres nobody in there
i think theyre in the last stall
max walks toward the fitting room enters it walks down the length of stalls and stops in front of the last one
he opens the door to the stall
sitting in the corner is the robinsons may bag
he walks over to it lifts out the towels and sees all that money
he replaces the towels picks up the bag and leaves
he walks across the designer clothes passes by amy says got em thanks
max walks unhurriedly toward the door that leads to the parking lot
hes outside nobodys stopped him
he keeps walking towards his blue seville
he keeps walking unhurriedly never looking back
he gets to his car uses opening the car door as an excuse to look back at the mall
nobodys after him nobodys watching him
he made it
max allows himself a smile gets into his cadillac with his half a million bucks and drives away
ordell sits at the bar in sams drinking a screwdriver and watching a stripper strip
there a ordell here
the bartender hands him the phone
dont talks all day
ordell takes the receiver
a stressed louis drives the toyota calling ordell on ordells tiny cellular
now into phone did you get it
i got it
listen theres something else i have to tell you
when i see you
pick me up at sams
you count the money
i havent even looked at it yet its still in the shopping bag
melanie must be dyin to see it
thats what i got to talk to you about
you see melanie was giving me a hard time not now pick me up
louis hears the phone disconnect
the toyota pulls up to the back of the bar
ordell hops in the car takes off
oredell in the passenger seat bends over to the backseat grabs the shopping bag and brings it to his lap
he looks like a kid at christmas
you keep drivin down ninth to where they got all them car dealerships
were gonna leave this heap in a parking lot and get one the cops dont know about
pause hey wheres melanie
thats what i gotta tell you
she bugged me the whole time
got pissy with me cause i wouldnt let her carry the bag
started running her fuckin mouth
i couldnt remember right away when we came out where the car was parked so she got on me about that
is it this aisle lou is is it that one
she was totally fuckin with my nerves
so what you left her there
i shot her
ordell just looks at him
i expect shes dead
ordell still doesnt say anything
then says you shot melanie
in the parking lot
couldnt talk to her
you know how she is
you couldnt just hit her
but at that moment
you shot her twice
so youre sure shes dead
where did you shoot her
in the chest and stomach
well if you had to do it you had to do it
what we dont want is that bitch surviving on us
anybody but that woman
ordell shrugs it off and digs into the shopping bag
he pulls out the towels and sees forty thousand dollars on top of a bunch of paperbacks
his stomach drops
he just looks inside the bag for the longest time
louis drives oblivious to ordells dilemma
not looking at him what
wheres the rest of it
looking at him how much it there
maybe forty maybe not that much
you said five hundred and fifty
calm so you light aint you
you light about a half a million
look thats the bag she came out with
she never even put her hand in it and neither did i
came outta where
the fitting room
it went down exactly the way it was supposed to
how long was she in there
maybe a minute
she came right out
louis you tellin me the truth
look i swear to fucking god she came out with that bag and i took it from her
we went to the parking lot
where you shot her
you sure she aint somewhere with a half a million dollars i worked my ass off to earn
louis looks at ordell quietly fuck you for asking me that
pull the car over
louis pulls it over and stops on ninth
whatd you shoot her with
its in there
ordell opens the glove box and takes out the beretta
he smells the end of the barrel
he releases the magazine
whats that gonna tell you if i was really pullin a burn id have taken two out wouldnt i
i thought you trusted me
ordell looks at him
louis didnt burn him
holding a bunch of money looking into the camera and saying with a smile gotcha nigga
jackies gonna die
he slaps the magazine back into the beretta
okay so it was jackie brown
if shes got it why didnt she take it all
fore i blow that bitchs brains out ill ask her
maybe the feds got it
if there were nothin in here but towels maybe she didnt get a chance to take it from her suitcase and a
but she put these fuckin books in here to trick our ass
thats why i never checked it
the bag felt right
then she throws forty thousand in here to rub the shit in my face know what im saying
she wants me to know she ripped me off
i dont know
either she has it or the feds
pause she gave it to somebody else first before melanie went in the dressing room
it gets real quiet in the car as louis remembers something
you know who i saw in the dress department
i didnt really think anything of it
no i did wonder what he was doing there but didnt think it had anything to do with us
you know like maybe he was there with his wife or girlfriend
you gonna tell me who it was
ordell has to look away from louis takes a beat then looks back
you see max cherry in the dress department
were about to be handed half a million dollars man look at me when im talking to you
and you dont think nothing of him being there
do max cherry and jackie brown know each other
hell yes they know each other
he bonded her out of county
how am i supposed to know that
you know the motherfuckers a bail bondsman dont ya
you know every last one of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell
why should i think anythings weird if i dont know nothin about them knowing each other
man i dont want to hear your fuckin excuses
louis gets mad
i aint givin you fuckin excuses im givin you reasons
oh you gonna tell me the reason you lost all the goddam money i got in the world
let me tell you the reason motherfucker
the reason is your ass aint worth a shit no more
louis turns into the hard convict on the yard and tells ordell hard you best back off
we hear a bam
ordell shot him
louis falls back against the car door eyes wide open staring at ordell
ordell takes the pistol works the barrel up higher on louis side right under him arm and shoots him again
this time louis head bangs against the car door window
he slumps over his life gone
ordell looks at him
what the fuck happened to you man
shit your ass useta be beautiful
ordell takes the bag and gets out of the car leaving louis dead body there
you didnt tell me you were gonna do some shopping
jackie still dressed in her cool black suit sits in a chair in nicolets office
davidoff between the fingers of one hand she holds a small white styrofoam cup of coffee in he other
i thought i did
i would think with all this on your mind youd wait till after
i got there early
ive had my eye on this suit wait lets start over
i got there early
the idea was to try on the suit see if i liked it
if i did get them to wrap it up and change back into my uniform
thats what sherondas expecting me to wear
go meet sheronda give her the bag with fifty thousand and go home
but you didnt do that
because i didnt have it
ray i swear melanie came in and grabbed it
pause and someone killed her for it
nicolet looks at jackie for a moment
wheres the bag she gave you
she didnt give me one
i told you before melanie wasnt part of the plan
ordell must of told her to do it
she bursts in grabs the shopping bag and takes off
what am i supposed to do go after her
im in my fucking underwear
i had to get dressed before i could do anything
so i put this back on cause could put this on faster than i could my uniform
you took the time to pay the saleswoman
i had to
i was frantic
i didnt know what to do
what did you do after that
i went looking for you
i went straight to the bookstore cause thats where you were last time but you werent there
how the hell else am i supposed to let anybody know what happened
you didnt tell me how to do that did you
i knew i was under surveillance so when i couldnt spot anybody i started yelling
there was a guy with melanie
not in the fitting room
pretends to shop
she watches louis grab melanie
we had our agent on you
she sees a blonde come out of the fitting room carrying a robinsons may bag and tussle with a tough looking white guy
the white guy takes the shopping bag and they go
this guy with melanie that was louis gara
i didnt see him
i was in my underwear

jackie lights up a davidoff
thats why a
s gotta make the case

they wouldnt have a case without me
if its his word against mine who are they gonna believe
its not that simple
phone in one hand smoke in the other jackie begins pacing back and forth
it never was so im not gonna start worrying about it now

all he really gives a shit about is getting ordell

max at the front door or raynelles apartment
he pounds on the door
ordell throws open the door
what the fuck you doin knockin on the door like the goddamn police

he looks past max

max enters ordell slams the door
as ordell turns away from the door maxis reaching into his coat
ordell brings his beretta up at max
you better freeze motherfucker
max freezes his hand in his coat pocket
you want your money

he takes his hand out its holding stack of bills wrapped in a rubber band
he tosses it to ordell who catches it with his free hand

she wants to give it to you herself and collect her ten percent
she also wants to explain why she had to hold on to it
id like to hear that too
turn around and put your hands on your head
max does this ordell pats him down
jackie didnt trust melanie
shed already tried to get jackie to go in with her split the half million amongst themselves
what she did was take quite a risk to see you get your money
lift up your pant leg
you help her
all i did was walk out with it
and you did that to protect my interest
in a way yes
my ass be dumb but im not a dumbass
go sit over there on the couch
this place stinks
you get used to it after a while
now tell me where my moneys at
and wheres jackie
shes been there since thursday night
she wanted to see me why wasnt she home
she was afraid
laughs that i gotta see
she still is
she doesnt want to get shot before she can tell you what happened
have her bring the money here
its in the safe
she cant get at it
call her tell her the combination
im telling you you got her spooked
she wont leave there till you have your money and youre gone
you expect me to just walk in there
if she wanted to set you up youd be in custody right now
when you said youd name her as an accessory she believed you
that scares her more than anything
thats why shes givin up my money huh
not that bullshit about melanie
i didnt trust her ass neither but i knew how to handle her
she was my blonde headed little surfer gal

jackie on the phone with ordell sitting behind maxs desk

she hangs up the phone
then starts dialing again
a stedicam glides through the apartment it falls on a beeper beeping a gun a wallet and car keys on a dresser drawer
it leaves that and lands on a tv screen tom snyder is interviewing a guest on his show it leaves that and falls on two empty and one quarter filled
it leaves that and falls on a sleeping ray nicolet passed out in his reclining chair
the sound of tom snyder and the faint beeping are heard offscreen
they leave the apartment walking to maxs car
all the time ive known her i never heard her sound scared like that
ordinarily shes too cool for school
im driving gimme the keys
max hands him the keys
they climb in
jackie sitting behind the desk
she opens the drawer to her right maxs
she closes the drawer
ordell behind the wheel max the passenger
ordell plays the radio he likes the song and turns it up
sitting alone in the office she gets up and turns off the lights
the office goes dark
the song plays loud
ordell moves his head to the music slightly
mak sits silently in the passenger seat sneaking a look at ordell every once in a while
sitting behind maxs desk in the dark
she takes out her davidoffs and lights one up with her bic
her face is illuminated for a moment then its out
she exhales a drag
his face is ice the music is loud
shes cool as a breeze smoking her brand
music is loud
max says its the next street
i know where it is
i know where to turn
sitting behind maxs desk
headlights shine in the window
she is lit by them
she puts out her davidoff and sits back in the chair
the light source cuts off
sitting in the parked cadillac
ordell has just turned off the lights and turns to max beretta in hand

she starts givin me some bullshit about it aint there
its somewhere else and we can go get it
he holds up his beretta im shootin you in the head right then and there

they both get out of the cadillac
ordell sticks his gun in his pants
get ahead of me and open the door
max steps in front of him puts his keys in the lock and opens the door
step inside easy
max sees jackie sitting at his desk in the dark
ordell sees this too and moves past max
hey girl what the hell you sitting in the goddamn dark for
max sees ordell moves past him
then he sees the bathroom door on the left side of the desk open throwing light into the room onto jackie and the figure who steps out of the bathroom
max sees ordell looks to dargus then back to jackie
then jackie says mark
raising her voice hes got a gun
max sees ordell almost jumps his arm goes to the beretta in his pants
just as dargus raises his gun and shoots him three times in the chest
ordell drops o the ground like a sack of potatoes he lands at maxs feet
max looks down and sees ordells head by his shoes look of panic still on his face dead as fried chicken
max sees dargus come over bending on one nee next to ordells body
max looks over at jackie still behind the desk
she looks eyes with max for a moment then stands and walks over to the body
then max sees one sheriff deputy step out of the dark holding a shogun
then winston step out of the bathroom
dargus looks up at max does he have the marked bills on him
max still shaken in his inside coat pocket
dargus reaches in and pulls out the envelope containing the forty thousand marked dollars
max looks at jackie
she looks down at the dead ordell with no expression just light up another davidoff
dargus looks up at max why were you with him
i went to give him his refund so he wouldnt have to come here
howd you know where he was
i found out
and you didnt tell the police
i told jackie and jackie said you wanted him
dargus looks down at he man he just killed
remember when ray said you hoped youd get him before he got me
dargus looks up and nods his head
well you did
she takes a drag on her davidoff
as opposed to the last scene late at night its early morning
max sits at his desk filling out a report
max hears someone go knock knock
max looks up and sees jackie brown standing in the doorway
she smiles at him
max flashes on jackie behind the desk
hes got a gun
dargus shoots ordell ordell drops
max smiles back
jackie walks toward him
i got your package
it was fun getting a half a million dollars in the mail
less ten percent
yeah your fee
i had to figure that out since there wasnt no note
she sits in the chair in front of his desk
only this isnt a bail bond max
i hesitated taking that much
you worked for it if youre sure thats all you want
pause between them
im leaving i have my things in my car
why dont you walk out with me
i want to show you something

he smiles and gets up from the desk
as she stands jackie says i saw ray the other day
boy is he pissed he missed all the excitement
whats he doing
hes on to a new thing
hes after a guy who owns a gun shop he says is woefully and wantonly selling assault rifles to minors
he says hes gonna take him down if its the last thing he does
did you tell him you were leaving
i told him i might
they walk outside and max sees ordells black mercedes convertible
theyve confiscated all his other stuff
but this ones sorta left over
the registrations in the glove box the keys were under the seat
whats a matter havent you ever borrowed someones car
not after theyre dead
she walks around to the other side of the car and looks at him across the black mercedes
i didnt use you max
i didnt say you did
i never lied to you

he shakes his head no

max doesnt say anything

max smiles and holds up two fingers close to each other
a little bit
jackie smiles back

they give each other a long tender kiss
she breaks it
ill send you a postcard partner
