thats total bullshit paul
look sir the favorability rate is
lets not lie to ourselves
if a kid likes a toy it sells
but every bit of research and focus testing
it works with research it works with focus testing it just doesnt work with the kids
why dont you watch where the hell youre going
are you okay
you could kill somebody running around here like that
its all right paul
the boss should get knocked on his ass once in a while
its good for him
i dont know sir maybe you should see a doctor

i didnt do anything to him
i think hes a terrific kid
i want proof that hes all right

i was just looking around
i come here every saturday
cant see this on a marketing report
whats a marketing report
what do you think of that
the championship hockey
oh i love it
well the pieces dont move
what do you mean
well on the old set you could slide the men up and down the ice and now all they do is spin around
it was more like real hockey the old way
why did they change it
i dont know
you see the star fighters are good because you can change all the pieces
but i never liked the galactakons
you only get one robot and they dont come with a vehicle
plus you cant take them underwater
and if you do they
okay lets check out the
everyday after school
what department did you say you were in
oh im in computers
you just saved me a trip to the gym son
vice president in charge of product development
hes only been here a week
and he came from data processing
hes out of his mind
the old man has finally lost it
did you know they gave him bobs old office
bobs office is bigger than my office
theres got to be a reason
things like this dont happen unless theres a reason
that means if the president dies you get to take over
they got a hundred of them
are we ready
come on in
look at this place
its bigger than the principals office
how would you know
remember that explosion in science
truck a killer
you know that only costs bucks to make
get out of here
what is this
oh well this is just
they just put this in here
it doesnt mean anything
so what do they make you do for all this
well i play with all of this stuff and then i go in there and tell them what i think
and they pay you for that
oh thank you miss patterson
could you call down to media and have them send up a video tape of the giants broncos super bowl
and have them edit out all the commercials and talkin and stuff
youre the luckiest guy i know
did you check mattel
he cant come from nowhere susan
he has to come from somewhere
how about hasbro
and fisher price and worlds of wonder
i have called everywhere
nobodys ever heard of him
face it paul
the guy comes from data processing
that is just terrific
this is just terrific
youre being paranoid paul
these tests were conducted over a six month period using a double blind format of eight over lapping demographic groups
every region of the country was sampled the focus testing showed a solid base in the to year old bracket with a possible carry over into the year olds
when you consider that nobots and transformers pull over percent market share and that we are targeting the same area i think that we should see one quarter of that
and that is one fifth of the total revenue from all of last year
i dont get it
what exactly dont you get
it turns from a building into a robot right
well whats fun about that
well if you had read your industry breakdown you would see that our success in the action figure area has climbed from percent to percent in the last two years
there that might help
i still dont get it
what dont you get josh
well theres a million robots that turn into something
and this is a building that turns into a robot
so whats so fun about playing with a building
thats not any fun
this is a skyscraper
well couldnt it be like a robot that turns into something like a bug or something
like a big prehistoric insect with maybe like giant claws that could pick up a car and crush it like that
a prehistoric transformer
so the robot turns into a bug
ah gentlemen listen
listen to him
hes got a very good idea here
the robot turns into a bug
this is a great idea
different sizes and things
you could have them wreck something
a lady bug
transformers for girls
this is a bug that moves
its got all kinds of possibilities
this doesnt just happen
this doesnt happen
you dont just come to a meeting and say bugs
well done josh
he is vicious
hes not vicious
oh come on susan dont kid yourself
that man is a killer
all he said was i dont get it
i dont get it
i dont get
i dont get
hes going for the throat trying to eviscerate me
did you see the look on macmillans face
its quite a unique space
the lines are so clean and you dont get any of that partition quality
it has foot ceilings all hardwood floors ample closet space a modern kitchen a brand new bathroom with a jet stream jacuzzi
well take it
dear mom and dad
they said that i could write you and let you know i was okay
so far theyre treating me fine
ive got enough to eat and im perfectly safe

susan im not what you think i am
what do you mean
before i met you i was in little league
i was in little league and i rode my bike to school and i played with my friends and hung out with them and
what are you talking about
i want to go home
i miss my family susan and i want to go home
oh my god
i knew that this was too good to be true
i knew that there had to be something
susan im not married
im a child
im a child susan and im not ready for all this
oh thats fine
that is just great
well you see what happened
im not ready to make a commitment
im not ready to accept responsibility
you dont understand
i mean im thirteen years old
and who isnt
you think that there isnt a frightened kid inside of me too
i mean i really am thirteen
i went to bed one night and i was a kid and when i woke up the next morning i was a grown up
and just yesterday i was a school girl with pigtails
why are you doing this josh
there was this carnival in new jersey
i made a wish on this machine
it was called a zoltar machine
oh stop it
it was called a zoltar machine
it had this bobbing head that looked just like a devil and if you got a quarter in the devils mouth you could make a wish and i did
so i made a wish to be big
that is what im trying to tell you
i changed into a grown up but im really just a kid
youre a kid
look i really dont know what it is that youre trying to tell me
but we have a very big presentation to give tomorrow so im going to get some sleep

sea point park new york
theyre waiting for you mr
see you around
theres this flat screen inside with pictures on it and you read it
and when you get down to the bottom you have to make a choice of what the characters going to do
like if he going to go in and fight the dragon then you have to push one of the buttons
i dont get it
well its a comic book that
see theres a computer chip inside which stores the choices so when you reach the end of the page you decide where the story goes
thats the point
a kid makes his own decision
this is really possible
in fact its a very simple program
isnt that right
so what happens when you run out of choices
well thats the great thing
you can just sell different adventures
just pop in a new disk and you get a whole new set of options
we could market this on a comic book rack
ill be right back
how much would the unit cost
well our initial figure is around
with a retail cost of around
you expect a kid to pay
for a comic book
i think a kid
would you excuse me
will you take me to sea point park new york
sea point park
you know him
you know josh
look you have to tell me where he went
who are you
im his girlfriend
look you have to tell me where he went
where did he go
please tell me
i wish i was a kid
you know you dont walk out on somebody
you dont just get up and leave and walk out like that
you dont do that
im really sorry
im really sorry but i didnt know what to do
i didnt know what to say
you got your wish
i tried to tell you
i didnt listen i guess
i didnt hear you
i tried to tell you last night
or want to
or how would i have
or even if i did listen why would i know
why would i know that
ive been thinking about this and there are a million reasons for me to go home but there is only one reason for me to stay
what reason is that
oh come on
