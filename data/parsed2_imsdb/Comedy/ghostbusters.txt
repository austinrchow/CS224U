by duane capizzi and steven roberts last revised may on the farmhouse roof a chicken shaped weathervane stands silhouetted against a full blood red moon
the wind howls and the vane swivels with an eerie squeak
then a weird animal cry is heard a cross between a chicken crowing and a wolf howling
a fenced in dirt area with numerous chickens milling around clucking as they peck at the ground
another howl nearer now the chickens heads jerk up toward the sound
a red tinted shaky moving camera truck in on the chickens
these shots are in the style of the pov shots in wolfen
magnified gurgling and heavy breathing of werechicken is heard
the terrified chickens stare into camera as the werechicken moves closer his shadow falling over them
they flap into their coop squawking wildly
maude and zeke sit on the sagging couch watching a werewolf movie on tv while munching popcorn from a huge bowl
theyre distracted by chickens sumpns stirrin up the chickens maude
jes set easy zeke
she rises heads for door ill take a look see
zeke continues staring at tv
through the werechickens red eyes we see a distant image of maude with a flashlight approaching the fenced in chicken pen and opening the gate
camera starts moving in toward maude as she enters leaving gate open
the dirt compound is empty now as maude crosses toward wooden chicken coop
as she goes here chick chick chick chick
as maude enters from out of camera her flashlight beam illuminates the chickens cowering on their roosts in a corner
they cluck nervously
whats got you girls so durned upset
there a coyote sneakin round
suddenly the werechickens shadow moves up maudes back then the wall
low gutteral clu uck maude looks over her shoulder at camera reacts
red eyed grotesque three times the size of an ordinary rooster as it stands framed in the moonlit doorway
it opens its fanged beak in a horrifying shriek as it springs at camera wings flapping
frightening shriek old black and white movie
melodramatic music as a man turns into a werewolf his howl a continuation of the previous werechicken shriek
eerie howl continues watching tv and eating popcorn
maude walks stiffly into room behind him eyes staring blankly
without looking up everythin okay out there maude
she stares with glassy red eyes and clucks quietly
pan down below maudes waist to reveal that shes turning into a chicken from the feet up
first her shoes rip apart as large yellow chicken feet sprout
then her dress swells and splits revealing a large feathered body underneath
the only piece of clothing left on her is her apron
one foot scratches the floor
more clucks now completely transformed and six feet tall she leaps up to perch on back of couch thrusting her chicken head repeatedly into the popcorn bowl in zekes lap
pecking the bowl clean
zekes jaw hangs open speechless as he stares at the fanged drooling six foot werechicken
the werechicken looks up from the empty bowl right in zekes terrified eyes
he scrambles backwards off the couch
scene red tinted
we hear loud squawking from within house as chicken feathers fly out the open windows
loud squawking watching from slight hilltop
its beak seems to bend into an insidious grin
from distance help
as camera moves in we hear egon could you hold off on the weather balloon bit for a minute
they stand holding big plastic bags of trash obviously annoyed at the o
rays armful of trash is piled so high that he cant see over it
slimer hovers behind sticking his nose in one of the bags like a dog
he finally dives right into it
its your night to take out the trash
and winstons in the kitchen doing your dishes
hes busy testing his weather balloon a large pink bubble half the size of the room
he moves a lever on its remote control unit and the balloon rises
preoccupied through above be with you in
checks watch one minute fifty three seconds
peter and ray exchange pained glances
peter awkwardly attempts to pick up another trash bag while ray stumbles around his vision blocked
pan with them as they move toward door when egons weather balloon suddenly lowers into frame
they bounce into and off of it which sends the trash bags flying
ad lib reactions as they bounce off balloon peter stumbles backwards and lands butt first right on one of the bags
slimer squeals from within it
big muffled squeal then he comes shooting out the back of the bag the lower half of his body flat as a frisbee
shakes himself off like a dog spraying slime all over peter
pissed sarcastic thanks slimer
i really needed that
ray helps peter up as the telephone rings and rings
the ringing phone is right beside him on the workbench
preoccupied with remote controls in a minute ray
he enters with sleeves rolled up wiping a plate with a dish towel and wearing an apron
sarcastic nevermind egon wouldnt want you to strain yourself
picks up phone ghostbusters central
excited chatter calm down
where are you
a beat as he listens well be right there
he hangs up
peter and ray again have their arms full of trash bags
even slimer is dragging one
ready for this one
some farmer says his wife was eaten by a giant chicken
hey even a half baked false alarm sounds better than doing egons chores
he drops trash bags lets roll
ray and slimer also abandon their trash bags and exit with peter and winston
still oblivious as he works in the suddenly empty room
i think ive finally perfected it
watch this guys
a beat he looks around over shoulder guys
ecto roars into camera siren and lights going
the ghostbusters minus egon are wearing their gear
slimer hovers in back seat
it sure feels strange not having egon with us
lately even when hes with us hes not with us
but wouldnt it be somethin if he sells that weather balloon idea of his
hell be a rich man
arms folded grumpily
then he can hire a maid to do his share of the chores
as it speeds out of camera toward distant farmhouse pan over to the apron wearing maude chicken silhouetted in the moonlight nesting in a haystack
move in to her body starts to shake she ruffles her wings
egg laying clucks then she suddenly sits up and leaps off the haystack revealing an enormous egg beneath her
maude squawks and clucks and struts off into a cornfield pecking away at ears of corn
squawks and clucks ray winston and slimer listen seriously as zeke speaks but peters obviously not buying it
had big blood red eyes it did
biggest dang chicken i ever seen
mebbe six feet tall
peter rolls his eyes
shouldnt be hard to find
is jotting info on notepad
did it have any distinguishing marks
its six feet tall
peter grabs rays arm starts ushering him to front door
over shoulder as he goes thank you sir
well put out a missing chicken report right away
as the three ghostbusters and slimer cross toward ecto parked in front
as they go this ones easy guys
old zekes been watchin too many horror movies and eating too much greasy popcorn
no peter i think were dealing with a bonafide werechicken here
peter and winston stop look at ray in disbelief
get serious ray
then explain those
ray points at ground
peter winston and slimer look down
peter is standing with both feet in two enormous chicken footprints
the three ghostbusters follow maudes chicken tracks with powerful flashlights across a field spotted with haystacks
slimer moves ahead nose to ground like a bloodhound
sniffs as he goes he floats along above the flashlight illuminated tracks which lead him right into the haystack
we hear a bonk from within then ow
slimer backs out into shot rubbing his head
he looks up and his eyes pop wide
the ghostbusters enter shot and play their flashlights across the huge egg sitting atop the haystack
excited whatd i tell you peter
a werechicken egg
gimme a hand winston
as ray and winston ease the egg down off the haystack
peter holds his pke meter up to it
look if this is a werechicken egg nothing registers on the meter
how come theres no pke reading
ray and winston still hold giant egg
looking at meter in peters hand i dunno
that is strange
lets get it back to headquarters and run some tests
then maybe well have some answers
oh no im not leavin
the werechicken that laid this has gotta be around here someplace and im gonna find it
throws up his hands with heavy sigh ill take it
they take egg from ray and winston and start back toward ecto l
shaking his head as he goes werechickens
through its red eyes we see from a distance peter and slimer carrying the egg ray and winston moving off in other direction
egon still busy with his balloon as peter and slimer carry egg in through door
through above yo balloon man weve got some real work for you how about analyzing this
egon looks around reacts to egg
thats the second biggest egg ive ever seen
peter and slimer set egg on egons desk
i dont wanna hear about it egon
weve had a long night in a not too fragrant barnyard so im taking a shower and hitting the sheets
peter exits as slimer zips in close beside egon elbows on desk chin in hands eyeing egon and egg expectantly
egon pushes glasses up off tip of nose and blinks at egg not sure what to do with it
camera moves in on egg and we camera pans down from full moon to reveal the tiny figures of ray and winston approaching an old barn
they stop shining their flashlights on closed main door
tired ray its gettin pretty late
maybe there really isnt any
holds up one hand shh
ray extends his pke meter toward barn
it beeps incessantly
low voice its in there
unclipping his blaster then lets get it
through its red eyes we see the barn door slowly creak open revealing ray and winston peering in
they enter cautiously ray holding his beeping meter out before him
the barn is dark except for the moonlight slanting through the loft window and the beams of their flashlights
as the wind picks up wood creaks hay rustles and a piece of junky machinery turns with a squeal
man this place is creepy
its in here i can feel it
suddenly the door slams shut behind them and the flap of beating wings scurries through the darkness
ray shines his flashlight toward the lofts
its beam catches a couple of startled pigeons as they fly out the window pinion feathers whistling
relieved sighs red tinted moving slowly toward ray and winston from behind
they stop as pke meter starts beeping
ray checks the reading
whisper somethings close
closing on ray and winston
the guys wheel around
we see only its face
the blood red eyes stare menacingly its fanged beak slightly open and drooling
it hops forward into a streak of moonlight
its three feet tall its wings hang out at the sides and its evil blood red eyes stare at camera
it is a werechicken
angle on ray and winston backing away blasters leveled
man he is ugly
it postures rooster like and roars angrily on ray and winston still backing up
bad choice of words winston
the werechicken suddenly leaps at camera
loud shrieking squawk zoom in on winston and ray
they open fire
the proton streams catch the werechicken in mid air as it vaults toward ray and winston halting its leap and suspending it in a corona of proton energy
a hideous spirit rises from its writhing body shapeless but with monstrous glowing eyes and fangs
the spirit lets out a roar more frightening than the werechicken howl
big roar ray still firing his gun snaps a trap loose from his belt and tosses it onto the barn floor
it pops open
ray and winston struggling with the writhing spirit caught in the streams guide the spirit into the trap
weve almost got him
the spirit is sucked into the trap which slams shut
a normal chicken with singed feathers stands where the werechicken was
it clucks starts pecking at the dirt
normal clucking looking at chicken well that takes care of one werechicken
ray picks up the smoking trap
now to find the six footer that ate zekes wife
they head for the door
ray i just had a thought
ray pauses to look around at winston
what if that six foot werechicken is zekes wife
and off their looks we egon carries the big egg into kitchen slimer helping
straining thanks for the help slimer but i dont have time to examine this egg tonight
i have to prepare for my weather balloon demonstration tomorrow morning
with his elbow egon opens refrigerator with and the two of them place the giant egg inside
through above but itll be safe in here
egon closes fridge
big yawn gnight egon
slimer floats off
slimer is snoring hovering above peters empty bed
in a bubble above him we see slimers dream various kinds of food dancing and singing the first two bars of los lobos la bamba a la the california raisins
in i heard it through the grapevine
still asleep slimer licks his lips hungrily opens his mouth incredibly wide and pounces on the entire dream balloon with a teeth jarring chomp
that pops the dream bubble so that it explodes inside his mouth waking him up
slimer sits up with a wide eyed hungry look rubbing his tummy
he zips o
lights go on then slimer skids to mid air stop and whips open fridge
his eyes pop as he sees the egg
licking his lips yummy
slimer rolls egg toward edge of shelf then the full weight of the egg drives slimer straight to the floor
the egg bounces on his stomach twice before he gets a grip on it
straining his little green brains out he floats the egg up into the air and o
squeals then grunts slimer shoves egg in the open oven closes door turns on the heat then moves o
the oven interior glows red and the egg starts to quiver
slimer hums as he busily sets table for one placemat a plate utensils salt pepper ketchup mustard mayo relish
a flurry of activity that all focuses on his personal eating spot
humming through above through window we see the egg shake and then begin to crack open
hovering at table still preparing for feast
he puts on a bib unaware of oven shaking behind him
still humming with a loud bang the oven practically explodes and the door flies off
out pops a baby werechicken snarling and cackling
his eyes bug and his paw drops
startled scream slimer barrels up through sink faucet leaving his bib stuck in the opening
peter shampooing his hair
slimer comes shooting out through shower nozzle hugs peter tightly around the neck and scaring the hell out of him
startled yell then slimer
how bout some privacy
pointing eyes wide monster
nods uh huh
imitates werechicken egon works at his table
a now familiar werechicken shadow appears over his shoulder and grows up the wall
werechicken creeps out of camera bites egon on the rear and pulls back o
chicken claws clattering off into distance
looking around ow
cackling fading into distance dazed he looks down at his feet
chicken toes pop through the leather one at a time
as egons transformation continues his coveralls rip apart at the legs then midriff then his arms turn into wings
finally a beak sprouts from his face
weird cluck peter now dressed and wearing his backpack runs up to lab door and flings it open slimer right behind him
peter and slimer look in not seeing egon who is now a six foot tall werechicken but still wearing his glasses standing behind door
to slimer well slimer i dont see anything here that looks like a monster
the egon chicken jumps out right in front of peter and slimer
slimer freaks and rockets right through the nearest wall
squeals as he goes holy cow
peter raises his proton gun
he flaps his wings wildly his red eyes bulging and growls revealing impressive fangs
egon the werechicken moves toward peter fangs bared in attack mode
snarling as he goes he steps back into doorway blaster leveled at egon chicken and snaps on the power
it hums to life
horrified whatd you do to egon you bird brain
a hand grabs peter by the arm fust as the thrower fires sending the proton stream off at an angle into ceiling barely missing the chicken
surprised as he looks around hey
as ray pulls peter out into corridor winston kicks door shut in the egon chickens snarling face and quickly locks it
slimer hovers nearby looking worried
the door shakes and shudders as the unseen egon chicken tries to break through
irritated through above whats wrong with you guys
that thing ate egon
peter that is egon
the egg hatched he was bitten and now hes a werechicken
the door behind them is starting to splinter and bulge from the battering of the egon chicken
looking at door youre kidding
a beat then come to think of it there was a certain resemblance
suddenly the battering stops
looking toward door what happened
hes so quiet all of a sudden
looking toward o
window he reacts
its the moon
he hurries o
ray stops at window looks out
beyond we see the full moon
peter winston and slimer come up behind him
tonights the first its beginning to disappear right to left
lunar eclipse in ten years
all looking out window as eclipse continues ray whats this have to do with egon being a chicken
turning to others werechickens only appear during a full moon and for the next few minutes the moons not full
door opens and ray pecks in
seen from the waist up hes not wearing clothes looking around confused
he sees ray
ray what is going on
egon is holding his tattered coveralls in front of his waist like a skirt
and why am i naked
suddenly slimer flies into shot and gives egon a big sloppy kiss
as he enters egon
sit down egon we have some good news and some bad news
as he sits bad news first
youve been turned into a werechicken
his glasses slip to the end of his nose as his eyes widen
he pushes them back up
he hurriedly thumbs through the tobin spirit guide
flipping through book were aardvarks
were bears werechickens
reads the werechicken appears during the full moon
anyone it bites will turn into another werechicken
he looks at egon that egg peter brought in it hatched and
he rubs his rear
through above i remember the bite clearly
how long will i stay like this
on ray winston and peter looking at the tobin guide
looking in tobins guide according to this there is an antidote
but weve gotta move fast the eclipse only lasts three minutes
slimer scrambles through the cupboard grabbing various bottles of stuff and hands them to winston who adds ingredients to mixing bowl and stirs while ray reads from tobins guide
reading through above one tablespoon paprika one clove of garlic some parsley for color cup of gelatin
through it we see the eclipsed moon starting to emerge from shadow
his pupils look constricted and hes perspiring
weakly i dont feel well
peter steps into shot puts arm around egons shoulders
through above take it easy egon
youre gonna be fine
worried hurry it up guys
reading hurriedly and one tablespoon of chickenbane
he rummages through shelves then looks down at ray
aghast no chickenbane
ray and winston exchange panicky looks
then weve gotta go with this
they run out with the mixing bowl of liquid
theyre once again turning into chicken legs and chicken feet
toes popping out like popcorn
come on ray
as peter and egon stare down at the chicken legs and chicken feet
hes changing again
ray slimer and winston rush into shot
breathless quick egon drink this
winston hands the bowl of potion to egon who gulps it down
swallowing gulping sounds as egon drinks his arms transform into wings and he drops the bowl breaking it
were too late
as the transformation and feathers rise up his shoulders
suddenly the transformation stops at the neck
dramatic music stops too
they stare wide eyed
after a beat what happened
to include egon who is once again a six foot tall chicken but with egons own neck and head
the potion only partly worked because of the missing chickenbane
well we hafta do something
dont get your feathers ruffled peter
theres a logical solution to every problem
strands of slime stand straight up on the nape of slimers neck at the sound like a frightened cat and he dives into a test tube in a rack on
squeals as he goes looking around
what was that
the werechicken that bit egon
its still out there somewhere
to others lets stop that thing before it makes drumsticks out of anyone else
to egon un no offense egon
the three normal ghostbusters dash toward door
ecto glides over the city running lights blinking
peter at the controls
slimer sits beside him looking down at the city through binoculars
into radio mike all quiet on the chicken front
how about down there
ray on the radio
not a peep
gives ray a dirty look no pun intended
several people run out front door screaming as ecto passes
screaming as they exit winston and ray look back at exiting people
winston cranks the wheel
as it makes a screeching u turn
ecto skids up doors open and ray and winston leap out blasters at the ready running toward store entrance
ray and winston run in and stop inside door beside a panicked box boy who points o
breathless its in there
a big chicken
its gotta be ten feet tall
ray and winston exchange glances
ten feet tall
nods maybe fifteen i dunno
he runs o
im outta here
to winston lets split up
they run off in opposite directions flanking the long aisles
pan with him as he cautiously moves along aisle by aisle
at far end of aisles winston can be seen doing the same
the market is thrashed spilled groceries everywhere
as they reach the last aisle
ray joins winston
how could we lose a fifteen foot tall chicken
frightened scream we didnt
they hurry o
hes hiding under his butcher block trembling
ray and winston run into shot
the butcher looks up eyes wide
a giant chicken just came through here it was thirty feet tall
thirty feet tall
the butcher is pointing out open door
beyond is a parking lot with a trail of crushed cars right down the middle
look what it did to those cars
ray and winston race out the door
the little chopper lights blinking skims low past three and four story buildings
into radio its how big
okay ray i admit you were right about these werechickens
peter and slimer as before
but i definitely dont buy them growing to the size of buildings
covers mouth laughter fizzing through his closed flapping lips
suddenly the head of the werechicken rears up into shot right in front of ray and slimer
deafening howl ecto is buffeted about by the howl as peter jams the stick forward
it makes a steep banking dive and gets the hell out of there barely escaping the big werechickens beak that snaps shut on thin air just behind ecto s retreating
peter is shaken but in control
slimer is trembling like green jell o
into mike ray you were right
the chickens here and hes a walking high rise
into radio on our way peter
winston floors it and he and ray accelerate forward into camera
egon is perched on the window sill looking pensively out at the city still a chicken from the neck down
a beat then big scream startled cluck startled egon flutters up off the sill gravity takes over and he lands on his feathered butt
revealing janine standing frozen in the doorway eyes wide with disbelief hands to her cheeks
its a long story janine
can you get my coat please
im due at the weather board in forty five
she stares at egon totally bewildered
thinks better of asking nevermind
janine takes a long yellow raincoat off a door hook and helps him into it
hes completely covered except for his head and feet
are you sure you wanna go to a meeting like this
im of sound mind at least
as he struts toward the door we see his tail protruding through a slit in the back of coat
he exits clucking
clucking as he goes staring after him in disbelief
it walks along stepping on cars kicking over telephone poles etc
a la godzilla
the streets shake
panicky pedestrians flee the werechickens giant feet
panicky walla peter and slimer are following giant chicken
into radio its heading down th toward the empire state building
ecto speeds around a corner siren blaring
were almost there
sun rises behind the werechicken as it approaches in distance
with each howl the streets shake
approaching camera fast it screeches to a halt
doors fly open
ray and winston leap out open fire their proton streams angling upward
moving toward them down the concrete canyon flattening street lamps and power poles
ecto can be seen flying above and behind it
the proton streams are up toward it
take over slimer
slimer grabs the control stick in both hands as peter leans out to one side with his blaster and fires downward
caught in the three crossing streams
it flails about knocking over street lights and bashing in the sides of buildings and lets out a deafening howl
a monstrous spirit emerges from its body and fills the screen like a transparent film
enraged howls ray tosses out the trap
lets reel him in
as ray winston and peters beams draw the spirit toward the trap
angry howls rays boot stomps on trigger and trap springs open
as the spirit comes into contact with the trap a small storm erupts around it
sparks and lightning bolts fly
a hurricane like wind blows
being buffeted by wind struggling to hang onto their throwers as they continue firing
they have to shout over the noise
loud traps full
somebody forgot to empty it
the wind is really bouncing it around
slimer has his hands full while peter continues shooting
whose job was it
turn to each other
light flashes rapidly
trap begins to shake and glow
its gonna blow
over walkie talkie peter get outa here
it banks gets the hell away
turn off their proton guns and are knocked down by the released force as the freed monstrous spirit whooshes skyward
the storm abruptly disappears as if sucked up
the trap stops shaking and snaps shut
as the spirit pops back into its body jarring it
its chicken face contorts with new anger
it turns and starts up the side of the empire state building
the werechicken is halfway to the top
pull back to reveal peter slimer winston and ray standing in street looking up at him
ecto and are behind them
so howre we gonna put that big bird on ice guys snaps finger peter thats not a bed idea
chicken freezes at very low temperatures
yeah but how do you freeze a foot chicken in august
a beat then the three guys look at each other
egons weather balloon
not far from the empire state building
egon stands before a group of seated men and women the weather board in his rain coat
to one side the weather balloon hovers above them
distinguished members of the weather board my weather balloon has the clu cluck clu capability the top of the empire state building is visible behind him as he holds the
small weather device control box in one winged hand
of entering the upper atmosphere where clu cluck clu cloud formations occur
they look at each other puzzled
puzzled muttering walla there it can electronically alter weather cut cut cut con ditions to produce sun rain or
ecto ascends into view behind him and hovers the choppers rotors blowing egons raincoat up over his head exposing the chicken body underneath
their mouths drop open as they stare at egons chicken body
excited walla he pulls raincoat down off his face holding it in place with one hand as he looks at audience with forced smile
to board members i er can explain this but slimer flies into shot beside egon and whispers in his ear
he looks around to where slimer is pointing
as the werechicken climbs into view scaling the upper stories of the empire state building
distant squawks the weather board members see the werechicken and start to scream
he jumps onto a rope ladder hanging from ecto and climbs inside
slimer flies in right behind him and ecto rises up out of shot
egon settles into passenger seat
slimer hovers behind them
loud over engine egon can we freeze that big chicken with your weather balloons holds up wings yes but youll have to work the controls
nods piece of cake
it banks off toward the empire state building as the werechicken reaches the top of the spire
as it gets comfortable on the spire fluffing its feathers
it begins to quiver like maude did earlier when she laid an egg
hideous crow on street below looking skyward through binoculars
whats it doing
it looks like its about to lay an winston puts a hand over rays mouth
with dread i dont want to hear it
it rises from weather bureau rooftop then drifts along horizontally away from the empire state building
it stops then begins to rise again
the sky darkens as the balloon rises into the clouds
peter egon slimer as before
peter operates the weather balloon control box while slimer flies the chopper
okay peter the balloons in position
turn the lever to the extreme left
peter turns a lever
the balloon and surrounding clouds start to freeze turning white and forming ice on them
suddenly snow starts to fall
he sticks his tongue out and catches some snowflakes
blizzard like snow pelts it
the chicken begins to stiffen and turn white with frost
angry squawks snow falls on ray and winston as they gaze skyward
they did it
they high five each other
a heavy snow continues to fall as camera moves in calls anyone for dessert
maude back to normal emerges from kitchen carrying a large steaming bowl
seated around the table are egon back to normal peter winston ray and zeke
there are half empty soup bowls in front of everyone and the diners all look full to the point of weariness except slimer
raising hand you bet maude
as he looks at bowl of soup maude sets down
lemme guess more chickenbane soup
spooning soup eagerly into his bowl
im actually starting to like it
no more werechicken problems for us eh egon
everyone freezes and looks o
it came from the lab
the ghostbusters burst from their chairs and run o
as the ghostbusters cautiously advance blasters ready
it opens and the ghostbusters peer in
another howl swish pan to
a huge shadow on the lab wall its head making a pecking motion like a werechicken
after a beat pan down to reveal slimer with a walkman on his head pecking his head to the rhythm of his music
slimer howls again
big sigh its just slimer groovin to his new james brown tape
as he continues to groove to the music
a la james brown i feel good
i knew that i would so good so good so good
big james brown howl as we peter turns to the others in disgust
long suffering tell me how do i get out of this chicken outfit
