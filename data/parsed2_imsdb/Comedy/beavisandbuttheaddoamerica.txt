beavis and butt head do america by mike judge and joe stillman b
b if window
href b b by mike judge and joe stillman the movie begins with scenes of people screaming in horror and running down the streets of a big city
the ground shakes from what seems like giant footsteps
there are pieces of building debris falling everywhere people getting crushed power lines coming down etc
it all looks very much like a japanese animated king kong or godzilla movie
we hear the footsteps getting closer and the ground shaking becomes more intense more debris falling
then we see a huge black tennis shoe come into frame and smash a national guard truck
as we pan up we see the white socks then the red shorts the ac dc t shirt then we hear the familiar huh huh huh
only its a huge sound
this is a three hundred foot tall butt head
butt kong continues his path of destruction stomping on cars and buildings and saying this is cool
huh huh huh
airplanes and tanks start firing at butt head butt kong
he looks irritated and says cut it out butt munch
butt head swats at the planes sending them crashing to the ground and stomps on the tanks
then something catches his eye
butt head reaches into a skyscraper and picks up a nice looking woman a lot like the one from the king kong movie
he looks down at her in his hand and goes wide eyed whoa
huh huh huh
the woman screams in terror as butt head looks down at her and tries a few lame pick up lines
im like pretty tall
huh huh huh
he swats down a helicopter that is circling his head dammit im trying to score
the helicopter goes down in flames
we cut to some guys sitting on a tank firing at him
they notice giant footsteps coming from the other direction and turn the tank around
through their binoculars we see a three hundred foot beavis coming from the horizon
the giant beavis is even more destructive than butt kong maybe he could be breathing fire
beavis starts trying to pick up on butt heads woman
butt head puts the woman down and he and beavis begin to go at it leveling the city with one of their stupid juvenile smack fights
we cross dissolve from three hundred foot beavis shaking butt kong to butt head asleep on the couch with beavis shaking him
hey butt head
butt head is dead asleep on the couch
beavis shakes him
butt head wake up wake up
butt head comes around
dammit beavis i was about to score
yeah but check it out
beavis is making strange noises in a state of shock
butt head rubs his eyes and looks at the empty space where the tv was
uuuuuuh huh huh
out the window we see two young men carrying b bs tv into their van
still on the couch butt head looks over at the broken window
we see a crowbar lying on the floor and the front door left open
butt head looks at the broken window at the crowbar the open door then back at the empty space where the tv was
he does this a couple of times piecing it all together
i think i just figured something out beavis
yeah heh heh
beavis is still in shock
they both stare at the empty space where the tv was for a beat not quite sure what to do
beavis is shaking and making weird noises
he presses buttons on the remote a few times as if it might help somehow
this sucks more than anything that has ever sucked before
we must find this butt hole that took the tv
s music blares
a fast driving car drives right at us and stops
punks run in fear
beavis hops out of the drivers seat wearing bell bottoms chain jewelry and a s afro
into a dramatic close up he takes off his glasses
beavis whips out a huge gun
freeze butt wipe
an attacker comes from one side
beavis uses judo
another tosses a knife
beavis ducks then shoots with two hands police style
a group of bikinid girls on a waterbed
butt head approaches them
he wears a leisure suit collar way open
he plops down in the bed
the girls wrap their arms around him
huh huh huh
come to butt head baby
action montage begins
styled like a s cop show opening
opening credits to the movie appear just as cop show credits would
beavis does a starsky and hutch style roll with a gun
butt head slaps a pimp
beavis drives chasing a car
butt head is slapped by a girl
huh huh huh

beavis and butt head are in a warehouse shoot out
a black police chief rises from a desk to yell at b b
b b dive for cover just before a building explodes
in close up beavis smiles for an id shot
butt head does the same
beavis in a rooftop fight kicks his opponent over the edge
a beautiful woman back to us takes off her dress for butt head
final opening credit appears
butt head and the woman fall into bed
from inside sound of equipment crashing
b b come out wheeling a tv on one of those carts
there are cables attached to it still leading back into the a
as they push the cart we hear more equipment falling
dammit its stuck
they give it one big push and it finally breaks free
we see that the cables are tangled with cables from other tvs and vcrs which all come crashing to the ground

doloris yanks them out of their seats and leads them down the aisle
angle down aisle in coach
doloris stops by a row where an elderly woman martha sits by the window
next to her two empty seats

huh huh huh
b b are dumbfounded
its too complicated
they struggle to make their seat belts fit getting each others parts
hi im tammy

butt head looks up
from his p
we see a beautiful woman tammy smiling her hands reaching down
falling in love harp music sting plays
close on butt heads lap as two female hands reach down and pull one strap from between butt heads legs
butt head looks down at his lap as tammy leans over him
a loud clicking can be heard
butt head stares blankly
there you go

stunned i love you
suddenly martha buckles beavis belt
wait i wanted her to do it

flight attendants please prepare for take off
the engines start to hum
the plane is rolling
butt head struggles to get his seat belt off
he does everything but pull the handle
beavis goes white with fear
the plane starts to shake
the engines rumble
beavis starts to freak
hey wait a minute

butt head bangs away at his seat belt
beavis looks out the window and realizes theyre in the air

oh my god
angle on cabin people start screaming
the plane quakes lifting up
on butt head furiously pulling dammit
that chick wants me

the plane arcs upward
butt head finally gets the belt off as the plane is in full thrust
he rises and goes tumbling backward down the aisle
on people seeing butt head flying screaming in panic
in free fall butt head grabs the door to the hangable luggage
it all comes tearing out
butt head flies up hitting several overhead luggage racks which open and spill their contents
butt head lands in the galley causing food to go flying and coffee to pour freely
on the cabin as the plane starts to level out
people stop their screaming
on butt head underneath the rubble poking his head out
hes directly across from the flight attendant station where tammy is strapped in
uh huh huh
could you like do that thing with my belt again
alls in order
flight attendants roll the beverage cart up the aisle
people read relaxed
on beavis and martha
martha is showing pictures of her grandchildren
beavis is showing the picture of dallas that muddy gave him
im probably going to make out with her first before we you know get down
youll have to speak up son
i have this ringing in my ears
my doctor says it could be related to my heart palpitations
ive had two operations on my heart

she hands him a box of nodrowz

heh heh thanks
he pours the contents into his hand and chews them like candy
then his eyes open wide
strange uh tastes like crap
beavis starts wolfing them down
tammy passes out meals from a rolling cart
she works with doloris
butt head stands behind tammy attempting to hit on her
to tammy so uh huh huh are you going to las vegas

tammy ignores him and moves on leaving butt head there
angle on butt head looking down at something
pan down to reveal hes looking at a beer on a fat guys tray
the guys asleep
butt head picks up the beer
angle on beavis nearby
the nodrowz is starting to take effect
beavis starts shaking babbling staring cross eyed at his fist etc
pre cornholio stuff tammy reaches her next passenger
hi were serving dinner

tammy moves forward leaving butt head standing there
in the background we see beavis starting to quake on the verge of cornholio mode
does the gumbo have corn in it
angle on beavis turned facing the cabin t shirt pulled over his head in full cornholio mode
i am cornholio
i need picatta for my bunghole
youll have to wait your turn sir

beavis starts to wander down the aisle
angle on curtain to first class cabin
from the other side sound of screams
we hear several call buttons being pressed
on butt head
he approaches tammy from behind
she ignores him
uh i got a beer
the pilots are relaxed and settled in when the door to the cockpit slams open
beavis is in the doorway screaming
i am cornholio
the pilots scream
the copilot jumps up so fast he causes coffee to spill everywhere including on the captains lap
the captain then jumps up hitting the controls and sending the plane into a in the back of the plane standing next to tammy
he starts to take a sip of beer
the nose dive of the plane causes butt head to go aaaaahhh
butt head bounces all overthe plane and then gets tangled up in the curtain that separates first class and coach
it tears off and he continues to fly forward
the captain is desperately trying to regain control of the plane
butt head slams into the cockpit landing on the control panel facing the captain
get the hell out of the cockpit
huh huh you said
the captain throws butt head back behind him and pulls the plane out of the dive
the plane lands
the flight attendants shaken smile at a line of people deplaning
the people are white with fear some covered with flecks of spilled food and other matter
they grow silent and still as b b pass by
beavis takes the t shirt off his head coming down from cornholio
huh huh huh

arriving passengers are greeted
a family is reunited
two businessmen walk up to limo drivers holding cards with their names
a reunited couple hugs
b b look around in confusion
uh huh huh this is las vegas

people greet and walk away
the place starts to clear out
one limo driver is left standing

harlan knocks on the door

harlan looks through the window and sees the shattered tv
no ones there
muddys four by four squeals into the lot and skids to a stop next to harlan and ross van
muddy gets out looking really drunk now

muddy gets in the four by four and starts it

harlan and ross seem momentarily confused
muddy revs the engine peels out backwards hitting the front of the van
this causes b bs tv and some other loot to spill out the back onto the sidewalk
ross starts to pick it up
just leave it
worthless piece o crap
we gotta start stealin from rich people
note i would like this to be a well known band red hot chili peppers doing their best imitation of a modern las vegas lounge act
i think a song like what am i gonna do with you by barry white or something obnoxious like bicostal by peter allan would be cool
or maybe sinatras you make me feel so young would be best
the car passes by major hotels and tourist sights finally pulling up to a big luxurious hotel and casino
gambling tables going on forever
on the lounge band playing the song weve been hearing
they should vaguely resemble the actual band doing the song
pan down rows of slot machines
pan across dealers handling cards and chips
dolly right up to b b staring in utter awe
reverse angle reveals theyre staring at a huge roman statue of a bare chested woman
their faces are blank
theyre seeing god

lights are popping on
billboards and signs are lighting up
the whole strip is coming alive
on b b still staring at the statue

the sophisticated people look repulsed
the doors close
music dips down for dialogue
b b step off the elevator and walk among the gambling tables
beavis pulls one of the playing chips out of his pocket and bites into it
these chips suck

tight on beavis face staring in wonder
this is where the music video hallucination sequence begins
it could even be so shameless as to actually have a chyron in the lower left hand corner
i would like to have a band white zombie
do a version of something like fire by the crazy world of arthur brown
this is the song that begins i am god of hellfire and i bring you
the concept of this will depend somewhat on which band we get but i would like to see it get pretty wild and surreal
if its white zombie we could incorporate some of rob zombies artwork
we see the sun above the horizon turn into a giant ball of fire
the ball of fire develops a face and speaks
i am god of hellfire and i bring you
music begins fire
this kicks ass
this is the greatest video beavis has ever seen
out of the ball of fire steps a beautiful woman in a bikini
at first the video is mostly the god of hellfire chicks in bikinis and various images of b bs tv in all its glory
as the video hallucination continues it becomes a psychotic mass of naked people fire tvs vultures b b head banging weird stuff from my high school notebooks etc
at one point we see the god of hellfire in a burger world uniform
as the song winds down we incorporate muddys car into the surreal imagery
we should also incorporate their tv as well as maybe some of the characters from the show that arent in the movie
then we reveal muddys car actually pulling up to b bs near dead bodies
the song ends as muddy tosses water on b b
reveal they were not far from the side of a road all along
b b snap out of it
they rise and find muddy hovering over them with a shotgun
im all wet

muddy aims his shotgun at b b
