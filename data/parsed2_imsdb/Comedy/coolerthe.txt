written by frank hannah wayne kramer the suggestion of traveling through space
suddenly a star sparkles to life in the distance
gives rise to another
until were looking at a whole galaxy of stars
no not stars
a throbbing skyline of neon
las vegas nevada
as seen from a descending aerial shot
we plunge down into her shimmering embrace
dissolving cruising the strip taking in modern day las vegas
sin city gone theme park
gigantic behemoths of pulsating neon the mgm grand
passing revamped faithfuls like caesars and the desert inn
then heading downtown to fremont street where old school vegas makes its last stand
binions horseshoe the four queens the las vegas club arid
one things for sure
this place aint no bastard child of epcott center
at least not yet
sure theres some flash going on but its more class than overkill
this is where the pros come to savor a time forgotten
a joint where every dealer knows your name
where part of the allure is the smell of moldy paneling and the tactile whisper of worn felt
where funny business doesnt just get you blacklisted
it gets you dead
lets us enter
tracking through the casino floor highlighting slot machine pay offs and pockets of rowdy players winning at blackjack craps and roulette
its just one of those nights
the tables are on fire
a floor manager nods as a hefty bet is paid out to a shooter at a craps table he checks out his watch anxious for the arrival of
from behind a figure in a suit
all we see is a murky reflection in gold elevator doors
the floor numbers descending rapidly
all anticipating the arrival of
the elevator doors open
and we pan down to the figures feet
he steps out onto the casino floor
and right away we notice he has a pronounced limp
following behind the figure
we havent seen his features yet
and wont for a while
the figure seen in soft focus passes a roulette table the wheel already in mid spin
his hand casually brushes the side of the table
and we pan across to the wheel just in time to see the ball landing on
the players howl defeat
the croupier rakes in all the losing checks with a slight nod of respect to the passing wraith
tracking past some blackjack tables
racking from the passing figure still in soft focus to a dealer calling out insurance
at the next table another dealer pulls a six card
off the players stunned reactions
one of the players instinctively glances behind him
but the figure has moved on
the dealer stifles a grin her eyes following the figure as he heads toward
a hot craps table
the crowd applauds as the shooter lands a hard eight
the dice are fished back to the player
he shakes them up with double ought bravado
we rack from his hand large in the f
to our murky figure passing in the background
the player throws
we keep tracking with the figure as the stickman calls it seven out
to a thundering chorus of disappointment
our figure passes by in the foreground while in the background we see a growing line of shame at one of the atm following behind our figure as he turns
into a corridor of slot machines
cut to reverse angle from the far end of the corridor
as the murky figure approaches a player in the f
hits a jackpot
another player in mid ground is also in the midst of a payout
suddenly with the approach of the figure both payouts trickle to a stop
kicks the slot machine dont you hold back baby
spit it out darlin
hey this aint right
sposed to be eight hundred dollars
wheres the goddamn manager
whos in charge of these rip off slots
following behind the figure as he turns out of the slot corridor and heads over to the bar
he pours himself a cup of coffee
hey doris you got any cream
doris the bartender wanders over with a small container
she starts to pour
we quickly steadicam around to reveal bernie lootzs features for the first time
his sad sack eyes register scant surprise at the empty cream container
hes just about to leave when an attractive cocktail waitress cruises up
natalie belisario late s mid s
everything about her sparkles except her eyes
theyre post mortem
she appears frazzled
sifts through some coin tips
to doris dewars and a diet coke
a sheepish look comes over bernie
he tries to catch her eye
she doesnt even glance at him
she looks at him
only the faintest hint of recognition
to doris hey you seen shelly around
he promised to position me at the tables tonight
ive been on skid row all week
chilly you didnt settle me from last night
and i was way under
its been like an a
convention the whole week
ill make up for it tonight
doris mutters something under her breath heard that one before and dumps natalies drinks on her tray
if i see shelly ill let him know
that youre looking for him
natalie grabs up her tray
doesnt even look at bernie
she takes off
thats the third time this month
to bernie let me get you that cream
staring after natalie nah its okay
dont get sweet on that bernie
not unless youre looking to get short changed
she raises the empty cream container for effect turns it over
a few drops dribble out
bernie limps away from the bar
we hear another spike of sound from the gaming area
as he approaches a floorman stops him
hey bernie shelly needs you on eleven
lets do the chivas regal
natalie bring it over
the one working nickel slots next to the paradise
i spoke to shelly earlier he wants her at the tables
the floorman nods walks off
bernie makes for the rowdy gaming tables
takes his time about it
his approach brings an ill wind to the area
the players appear to sense it
its in their reactions
a slight hesitation of the dice
fingers tensing over a pile of chips
a hand tugging at a tie
the cooler has arrived
as he reaches table eleven natalie intercepts him with a short glass of chivas regal
this is you right
takes it from her thanks
joe said i should stick around
you say something to shelly
bernie just smiles at her
that was fast
she offers up a smile
it jump starts those dormant eyes
her whole face comes alive
notches her up from an eight to a ten
bernie immediately glances away
hes afraid what she might read in his gaze
dont mention it
bernie gestures her over to table eleven
immediately makes the high roller in question
a good old boy named bulldog
hes the one boasting loudly as he shakes the dice with one hand
ill make you a fortune on five and nine
cmon forty five sixty three fifty four
bernie grabs the drink from natalies tray intentionally bumps bulldog
hey buddy is this your drink
back off pal
im on a roll here
another man gladly accepts the drink
meanwhile bulldog sends the dice high up into the air
they drop perfectly on the table
the stickman calls it
thank you for those bets folks
the croupiers hungrily devour the chips from the table
bernie moves on quietly before anyone notices
but hes been noticed all right
not quite sure what shes just witnessed
who is this guy
we hear a voice over the intercom
conway party of twelve please check your reservation at the paradise lounge
bernie reacts immediately to the code words over the speaker
to himself yeah yeah im comin
a a player makes a hard six at a craps table
the players howl
b from the same angle we pan up from losing dice to the same guy
bernie looming large in the background
a bernie taking a seat at another blackjack table
next to him a full table of players on a good run of cards
b the same table with less players as the dealer appears to be gaining an edge over the players
the only thing filling up are ashtrays
c same again with one player
this time with natalie watching in the background
quick jump cuts show the players mountain of chips going down until there is only one
d the dealer taps the felt for the man to bet his last chip
after a moment of indecision he flips the chip into the air
the chip becoming an alka seltzer dropping into a glass
the glass is in shelly kaplows hand
director of casino operations for the shangri la
late s early s
distinguished slick oozing charm
but lose the cartier armani and paco raban and youre looking at pure street
hes watching bernie through the two way glass
shakes his head in admiration
suddenly the office door swings open
three men stride in
shelly projects immediate deference to nicky fingers bonnatto
former geovassi family underboss from back east
the guys a relic from the days before mbas became the weapon of choice in the family business
he wears his corporate makeover like a bad coat of paint with traces of mulberry street primer showing through
nickys accompanied by a pair of corporate types in hugo boss threads
shelly glances their way with a look that suggests hes working himself into a full on sphincter wind up
bad news x
shellys muscle lou stands off to one side with an apologetic expression
nicky how the hell are you
i didnt know you were coming in
nicky reaches out to shake shellys hand
gets nothing back then remembers
shakes his head whassimater
you think i dont wash up after goin to the john
forget about it
nicky grabs shelly embraces him
uncomfortably you shoulda called ahead
i woulda sent a car
we thought wed surprise you
well anytime nicky
shelly sizes up the corporate types
shelly i want you to meet one of our smartest vps larry sokolov
and his numbers guy marty goldfarb
shelly sees where this is going
larry extends his hand
how do you do shelly
then catches himself
quickly pulls it back
shelly stares him down for a tense beat
what can i get you boys to drink
off their uncomfortable expressions
shelly seated across from nicky larry and marty
what brings you to town nicky
nicky looks cautiously across the table
look shelly this is your joint you run it the way you see fit
but we got a smart kid here and hes got some good ideas on how to revitalize the shangri la
what are you talking about
we did thirty five million last year
nicky shoots a look over at larry and marty
larry takes this as his cue
first off shelly i want you to know i have nothing but respect for you
youve done a fantastic job with the shangri la for the last sixteen years
no one would dispute that
yeah no one doubts that shelly
shelly nods carefully
but the business has changed out here
you just have to take a look at the strip to see what im talking about
you mean that amusement park mook fest out there
you know what that is
thats a fucking violation of something that used to be beautiful
that used to have class
like a gorgeous high priced hooker with an exclusive clientele
and then that steve wynn cocksucker knocks her up and puts her in a family way
nicky and larry exchange looks
marty drops his gaze into his lap
now shes nothing but a cheap fat whore hiding behind too much makeup
i look at her and see all those ugly stretch marks and i want to cry
cause i remember her as she was
theres no denying the bottom line
those eyesores are raking it in
and we cant compete against that
you think im trying to compete with that
you think this joints about bringing in the stroller crowd
fresh off some fucking e ticket ride looking to break the house on red and black
fremonts never been about that bullshit
this is where old time and real money comes to play
the numbers they dont back you up shelly
we all love nostalgia but it belongs in a museum
i think its time to decide whether youre running a museum or a casino
shelly is close to losing it
he catches himself takes a breath
hey forget about it
well talk later
rubs his hands together so hows the action
larry shoots him a disapproving look
off shellys disturbed expression
hes already calculating serious damage control
bernie makes his way across the casino floor when hes intercepted by shelly
got a moment
i was just heading over to it can wait
shelly escorts bernie over to a nearby bar area
the bartender zips over with some drinks
hows the knee
natalie steps up to the bar a few feet away
puts in a drink order
she catches bernies eye
i was speaking to this orthopedic surgeon over at vegas memorial
he tells me they can replace a mans entire kneecap with titanium
its the kinda thing that costs a shitload but since the mans into us for five hundred large im sure we could stealing glances at natalie i told you im
not gonna be around after sunday
sighs where you gonna go bernie
where the fuck are you gonna go thats bettern here
i got you covered in this town
people they know you work for me thats currency in your pocket
thats fuckin respect when you walk the floor
where you gonna get that anyplace else
sighs seven days shelly
seven days and im out from under
a beautiful woman in a low cut dress sashays her way past them heading for a high rollers craps table
shelly reaches out napkin in hand grabs her arm
hands her his card
she snatches it looks it over
immediately loses all attitude
i like to know whos shopping it in my neighborhood
you wanna keep working the shangri la you come see me tomorrow morning in my office
well go over the rules together
and before you come you bring me a clean bill of health
the hooker just nods
all right get outta here
she takes off
at the same time natalie leaves with her drink order
they walk in the same direction
shelly mistakes bernies wandering look for interest in the hooker
you want that bernie
ill keep a tab running for you
bernie shakes his head whats a matter
not your type
bernie just stares after natalie shelly finally picking up on it
things are getting hot on fourteen
i gotta go
he limps off
shelly stares after him
a predator seizing up his prey
bernies buick electra pulls into the parking lot of a flea bag motel
next door to the motel we see a convenience store with the name the ez mark in pink glowing neon
its actually supposed to read the ez market but the last two letters of market have burned out
one of those center pool style motels
a hard luck oasis if ever there was one
as bernie limps toward his room his neighbor a low rent hooker approaches from the opposite end of the courtyard with a huge ass john in tow
they converge at their doors at the same time
theres a weariness about the hooker thats endemic to this town
she winks at bernie
he nods at her
then casts a furtive glance over at the john
the man flips him off
the hooker mouths sorry
bernie hastily enters his apartment
bernie flips on the light
a dim overhead bulb hardly makes a dent in the gloomy surroundings
typical drab motel furnishings
we notice a couple of dead plants on the radiator next to the window
a single place setting on the counter
something odd an empty cat food bowl on the kitchenette floor
no sign of a cat
bernie heads over to the dresser
a half filled bottle of gin rests next to a lone glass with a crack down the side
he pours himself a shot
turns on the tv
a religious channel
an appalachian pentecostal service
the members of the congregation taking up snakes and writhing around in religious hysteria while a number at the bottom of the screen solicits viewer donations
bernie doesnt even try to change the channel
he takes a seat on his bed props himself up against a pair of pillows stretches out
from next door the sounds of wild humping
oh yeah baby give it to me
oh yeah thats the spot
do it to me harder you big stud
bernie closes his eyes tries to ignore the x rated soundtrack coming at him through the carpaccio thin walls
the hookers moans are starting to get to him
he raises his fist to the wall then stops himself
hes just not the confrontational type
instead he heads over to the tv cranks the volume up
the hysterical moaning from the snake ritual now blends in with the grunting and groaning from next door making for a bizarre remix that could only exist in the world
of bernie lootz
bernie emits a deep sigh closes his eyes
big action at the craps tables tonight
the players cheer as mr
pinkerton makes another pass
he exudes used car salesman
natalie arrives with his drink
seven and seven
pinkerton reaches for the drink without taking his eyes off the table
he throws a hard six
the crowd cheers again
he turns around stuffs a hundred dollar chip down her shirt and slyly cops a feel
natalie shudders in disgust
she spins around to leave
runs smack into bernie spilling her tray of drinks on him
im such a klutz
bernie wipes himself off helps her pick up the pieces
its all right
natalie tries to wipe him down a bit more
sorry this guy
fuckin hands you know
you might want to stick around
bernie wiggles his way next to pinkerton
he gives the stickman a certain look
excuse me mr
you have no hard eight
throwing in a chip gimmie a hundred dollar hard eight
bernie just watches as pinkerton throws the dice
eight the hard way
the players go nuts
the stickman taps the felt in front of the shooter
nine hundred dollars to mr
the boxman seated at the center looks up at him
you can take that action
the boxman feigns concern then nods in approval
thats what im talking about
none of this low limit bullshit
just as the stickman feeds pinkerton the dice bernie flips a dollar chip over toward the center of the table
natalie peers between them to catch a glimpse
dollar hard eight
the chip lands on pinkertons parlayed bet
he releases the dice from his stubby little fingers
hard eight comes down
the players cry out in defeat
pinkerton grumbles to himself
he fingers his rail of chips
five hundred dollar hard eight
and press my nine up two units
he throws in the chips
the croupier places his bets
the dice are fed back to him
easy way eight
pinkerton is fit to be tied
after a passing moment of clarity he empties his entire rail
the entire table stops down for a second
way to go pinkie
bet the farm
pinkerton sets his dice carefully and lets them fly
pinkerton slams his fist down on the table
he turns to leave the table to find natalie smiling at him
what the fuck you smiling at bitch
pinkerton starts to lose it
security moves in right on time
natalie shoots bernie a satisfied look
he averts his eyes shyly and limps away
she stares after him for a moment
buddy stafford the paradise lounges star attraction is performing on stage
hes a poor mans tony bennett
mid to late s
a staple at the paradise for the last years
the singer sluggishly descends the stage to the lounge floor almost tripping over his microphone cable
buddy works the room leaning in real close to the ladies delivering the requisite eye contact
when their companions react with mock outrage buddy raises his fists playfully in a boxers defensive stance
its classic buddy stafford schtick
from somewhere across the lounge an attractive woman jumps up and throws her panties at buddy
buddy catches them and waves them in the air
just as another pair whizzes by
we pan across to shelly seated at his corner booth in the company of nicky fingers larry and marty
tight on shelly as he focuses on buddy
a smile threatens his patented stoicism
hes flashing back on the old days
while nicky and marty are clearly enjoying buddys performance larry fixates on the singer with joyless eyes
we take on larrys pov of buddy slow motion close ups of buddy singing
the music slowed down with the action emphasizing buddys lack of energy
sweat dripping off buddys forehead splattering into tiny jewels against his microphone
buddys tired eyes
shaking hands around the mic
smash cut to real time applause as buddy reaches the end of the song
larry is the only one not clapping
rack across to shelly as he picks up on this
shelly approaches buddys dressing room
he enters without knocking
to find a trembling buddy hunched over on a sofa hugging himself
buddy immediately sits up
i was a goddamn embarrassment tonight
i shouldna let you talk me into going on
massages his throat its definitely strep
you were velvet out there pops
shelly throws a pair of red silk panties to buddy
we see a room number scribbled on the crotch area
they were hanging on the door outside
forget your tonsils
when the muff confetti stops coming thats when you got yourself a problem
dangling the panties on his finger you get a receipt
charmaynes in the lobby
they got these on sale in the window
victoria secrets valentines collection
and the broad waiting in the room what she set you back
always grade a for ol buddy
are you kidding me
snatches the panties away from buddy you dont fucking deserve this
all those ladies going home with a sweet breeze between their legs because you still do it for them and youre fingering me for some kinda buddy stafford ego pimp
hey fuck you old man
shelly feigns as if hes leaving
affectionately get back here you prick
hand it over
shelly throws the panties back at buddy
buddy just stares at him with pained eyes waiting for something else
sweat mirror balls his wrinkled forehead
removes a foil package from his pocket
hands it to buddy
the singer rushes over to his dressing table
unwraps his works
rubber tubes his forearm
trembling hands juggle lighter and hypodermic
shelly takes a seat on the sofa
buddy euphoric as the dope hits the spot
tears in his eyes
he picks up on shellys somber expression in the mirror
you got that nostradamus look
shelly shakes his head
you ever watch those nature shows on shelly shakes his head
ive seen this one a dozen times
its about lions
cycle of life thing
the leader of the pack
its called a pride
the leader of the pride
when he gets on in years
its just a matter of time before some young male arrives on the scene to challenge him
they go at it and the old cat gets the crap beaten outta him
in front of all the females this goes down
and after hes defeated hes cast out of the pride to scavenge and die alone in the bush
yeah natures got a real sick sense of humor
its fucking tragic because the old lion cant figure it out on his own
that hes past it
itd be so much easier for him to just walk away and save himself all that pain and humiliation
thats like admitting to yourself that youre already dead
i prefer natures way
a beat yeah
shelly holds buddys gaze in the mirror
shelly exits the dressing room to find larry waiting on him
hes accompanied by a good looking young man
shelly got a minute
shellys expression no
but he heads over anyway
shelly this is johnny capella
how ya doin shelly
johnny extends his hand
shelly ignores the gesture
i know you from somewhere right
johnnys been opening for danny ganz at the mirage
sonys talking about signing him to a three album deal
theyre positioning him as the new ricki martin
and i should be interested in this why
johnnys looking to headline
i told him we might be interested
hey if this is a bad time
even if i were interested buddys got ink with us through
i just renegotiated his contract last year
sounds like the two of you need to get on the same page
to larry if i dont hear from you by thursday im taking the stardusts offer
johnny nods at shelly takes off
shelly and larry eyeball each other for a long cold beat
shellys about to say something when nicky and marty approach
larry shrugs flashes a chilling smile
i wanna buy the old fart a drink
buddy asked me to send you his regards nicky
hes not feeling so great
i think hes got that stomach flu thats going around
thats too bad
shelly isnt fooling him well another time then
hey shelly nicky says you might be able to hook us up with some showgirls
something with class
shelly eyeballs marty for a tense extended beat
what do i look like some fuckin pimp college boy
just as martys starting to get real uncomfortable shelly cracks a smile
sure no problem
you got any preferences
jumps in yeah
something with big headlights nice rims and low mileage
you got any asian babes
shelly looks to larry
i think ill just stick with the tables
we linger on shellys unsettled look
this guy is bad news
bernie weaves his way through the lot to his car
arriving at his buick hes startled to find natalie leaning against it
she holds up the chip the drunk tipped her
buy you a drink
off of bernies surprised expression
cheesy polynesian decor
mood lighting an excuse to keep the electric down
basically a joint where people come to lose themselves
natalie and bernie are seated in a booth near the back
she sips on an umbrella drink hes nursing his usual gin
natalie has an astrological chart in front of her
in between sips she makes annotations to the chart
almost to herself your progressed venus is gemini
degrees and is in direct motion
which tells me that youre a slow starter when it comes to romance
off bernies taken aback expression you know what
this is real unprofessional of me
i shouldnt discuss your chart with you until im all done
i can tell by that look you think this is all a lot of no
i just know what the outcomes going to be
theres not like one particular outcome
a lot of things enter into it
the planets moon phases
the outcome wont change with me
itll be all bad
god i have never met anyone who was so down on themselves
i used to be down on myself ok
i dont go there anymore
ive got just three more correspondence classes with this stuff then ill have my certificate and everything
and you know how i got ok
deadpan you had your chart done
yes as a matter of fact that is perfectly correct
do you know what i do at the shangri la
i asked around
youre a cooler
you turn winners into losers
and do you know how i do that
i know theres stuff that goes on in casinos all the time i do it by being myself
people get next to me and their luck turns
its always been that way
that sounds to me like a self fulfilling prophecy
theres a whole chapter on that in my course
anyways i can see a big factor in your life is that youre lacking companionship
theres nobody to deflect off
if youve got as you put it bad karma then you need someone with good karma to neutralize it
well thats my take on it anyway
bernie maintains eye contact with natalie for an extended beat
then drops his head gazes at his glass
i dont know about you but im real tired
bernie motions to stand
natalie just remains seated
i have this recurring dream where im on some beautiful island in the bahamas
im sitting on the beach taking in this amazing sunset with one of these in my hand gestures to her drink and then it starts to rain
and i wake up and its my roof leaking on me
yeah im also real tired bernie
not even sure why hes telling her this i only got six more days
well almost five really
then ill be leaving town
only five more days
a beat then we shouldnt waste any more time
natalie covers bernies hand with hers
why dont we go back to your place
completely caught off guard i uh
if this is
i dont know
i dont know if i can afford
natalie flinches slightly
then swiftly regains her composure
an honest mistake
im so sorry
i didnt mean
you see thats exactly what im talking about
ive gone and cooled the damn table
ah just shut up bernie
you havent gone and cooled anything
not by a long shot
natalies hand flips on the television
another bizarre religious service
we pull back from the screen as she tries to change the channel
just gets a whole lot of static
bernies standing uncomfortably in the middle of the room
you should complain about this
im not here that much
sorry all i gots gin
ive had my fill
bernie walks over to the dresser pours himself a shot
natalie glances around
she notices bernies dead plants
you know once theyre dead they dont really grow back
in case thats what youre waiting for
her eyes land on the empty cat bowl
shes about to say something when she picks up on bernies expression
lets not even go there
she gestures to an old record player in the corner
got any music
bernie opens one of the kitchenette cupboards
except for a lone record up on top
he brings it down
its a sinatra album
never been opened
natalie looks on as bernie meticulously removes the record from its sleeve
he blows a few particles of dust from its surface
then delicately lays it on the turntable
the way he goes about this is incredibly ceremonious
with as much care as given to disarming a nuclear weapon
natalie cant help but smile
bernie lowers the needle to the first cut of the record
everything seems to be going so well until
the needle skids across the surface of the record with a sound worse than chalk on a blackboard
bernie opens his mouth in a silent grimace
and a delicious laugh comes out
its natalies laugh
talk about a tension breaker
bernie turns to her shrugs
he tries again
this time the needle catches
and sinatra takes command of the room
hes singing this town a finger snapping upbeat valentine to vegas
marred only by a slight clicking caused by the scratch
natalie summons bernie over with her wagging forefinger
he picks up his glass shuffles over
i promise you at least one of us has done this before
this is not my first sssh
she starts massaging his shoulders eliciting involuntary moans from him
bernie is almost in tears
nobodys touched him like this in years
and it shows
natalie takes bernies glass gulps down the remains herself then sets it on the floor
she drops down next to bernie
starts kissing him
takes it slow
youre doing real good
they fall back onto the mattress
natalie taking the reigns maneuvering her hips kicking off her panties
bernie gets an eyeful of a tattoo on her butt
a pair of dice
in seconds natalie has separated bernie from his pants and underwear taking him inside of her ol blue eyes keeping the rhythm
natalie moans uninhibitedly
surprise shes a real screamer
moments later we hear banging from the hookers side of the wall
some john telling them to keep it down
bernie with tears of elation in his eyes thrusts away at natalie
for all of thirty seconds before he explodes convulsing in her arms with a stifled gasp
frank winds down this town a few seconds later
poor bernie he didnt even make it through the song
natalie wraps her arms around him
dont worry bernie
ive had worse
well try again later
bernie rests his head on her breasts
closes his eyes
we hold on him
a few seconds pass
and he breaks into a smile
fade to black
tight on bernie sleeping
he still has that goofy smile on his lips
a beat or two later he opens his eyes
we pull back to reveal that hes alone in the bed
no sign of natalie
bernie turns to the pillow next to him buries his face in it
takes a deep breath
moans at her scent
he still has his face in the pillow sucking in deep breaths when natalie steps out of the bathroom
hey so you wanna get some breakfast
bernie just looks up at her replay on the goofy smile
i did six months at rikers for running numbers
it was shellys thing but i took the rap for it
bernie and natalie sit eating breakfast
after i get out i call up shelly and he tells me to come out here
i figure hes going to set me up good at the shangri la
but he tells me they got all these rules about casinos employing felons
so he gets me this gig doing telemarketing for one of their fronts trying to scam pensioners out of their retirement money
i lasted two weeks
as bernie talks natalie spies a very pregnant girl s coming out of the restroom
her eyes follow the girl back to a table where a young man s waits on her
already i was getting in deep
finally it got so bad i had to beg shelly to take on my markers around town
that just bought me more time to keep losing
i put shelly in an awkward position
i understand why he did what he did
taps his knee he did that to you
what he shot you
off her cringing expression i got off easy
thats getting off easy
i was out of control
but he maimed you
let me tell you something
im grateful for what he did
off her stunned look no kidding
every time i get an urge to play off the clock to so much as drop a quarter in a slot i reach down and squeeze whats left of my
its one helluva reminder
i thought stuff like that didnt happen no more
like that was just in the movies or something
bernie holds her gaze her for a moment
anyway shelly and i worked out a payment plan
two years off the books at the shangri la cooling tables
five more days and i walk
before natalie can respond we hear the pregnant girl start to moan out loud
the waitress rushes over
clutching her belly oh shit i think im going into labor
the young man at the table rushes her to her feet escorts her toward the exit in a dramatic fashion
all this without paying the bill
as they pass by bernie and natalies table the girl trips over natalies purse
bernie quickly helps her up
thats when he notices the young man
theres a quick moment of confusion
bernie feels a bit thrown by it all
bernie accompanies them out to their car at a quick step
once out the door the girls contractions appear to have subsided
natalie walks with the girl to try and help
im ok now
bernie pulls mikey aside
youre not the
nods bulls eye
obviously runs in the family
i guess youre gonna be a grandfather bernie
they reach the couples car
a rusted out ford fairlaine
by the looks of it theyve been living out of it
hey what the fuck it runs
anyways we gotta be somewhere
hows your mom doing
im gonna pretend like you give a shit and tell you shes getting by
as long as shes wasted
he gazes past mikey to the girl
names charlene in case you were wondering
looks like shes carrying a whole litter in there dont it
when was the last time you saw a doctor
charlene sidles up alongside mikey
this clinic in jersey
maybe six months ago
i wasnt about to go back after they treated me like cattle
just because i didnt have no insurance
and those places theyre crawling with t
from all em spies
so youre in town
maybe a week or so
got some business to take care of
if you want stop by the lucky star motel
give us a chance to catch up
im on three to eleven shift at the shangri la
i work the floor
well how bout that
yeah maybe ill do that
we can play catch up
for the kids sake
to charlene take care
mikey helps charlene into the front passenger seat
they drive off
natalie looks to bernie
shes curious but doesnt ask
he appears thankful for that
close on a skyline of black chips neatly positioned on the felt
we see the owner of the chips strike a match
his last one
it fizzles out quickly
tilt up to the players face with an unlit cigarette hanging from his lips
a hand quickly reaches in lights the cigarette with a zippo
pull back to reveal bernie
dont mention it
bernie sits at the table
he knows the routine hundred dollar minimum here sir
bernie peels off a hundred from his billfold
lays it on the felt
money plays one hundred
to bernie no offense pal but theres twenty other tables
what do you wanna come sit on my head for
just wanna play one hand
feeling lucky tonight
i got this voice in my head says this is the table
i know this is the table
im already doing good here
its my fucking table touching him hey heard the one about the fella walks into a bar and says hey who owns that big great dane outside
a man at the end of the bar raises his hand
the fella says yeah
well my dog just killed it
the dealer finishes shuffling begins to deal
whaddya mean your dog just killed my great dane
what kinda dog you have
the fella just shrugs and says a chihuahua
you tellin me your chihuahua just killed my great dane
a beat i dunno the fella says i think he got stuck in his throat
bernie starts laughing
the player is less than tickled
just then the dealer interrupts them
we see the dealers got an ace showing
the player waves off the insurance as does bernie
the dealer checks
as the hand plays through the dealer busts out
bernie glances over at the dealer
what the hell
bernie places his chips again
you said one hand
agitated to dealer keep going
the dealer plays
bernie and the high roller win again
bernie glances around him uncomfortably
we see shelly approaching
shelly just has a nose for when things arent running smoothly
larry is lurking behind him
the dealer turns up some cards
and again bernie and the high roller win
bernie looks absolutely perturbed
shelly gestures something with his head
bernie cashes out
hey stick around pal
you and me we make a great team
bernie strolls over to shelly
shelly guides him away from the table under larrys watchful eye
what was that
bernie shrugs still confused
well what fucking gives
is it mcgann
hes been with us twelve years
the mans as standup as my dick
thinking to himself maybe hes got money problems
im gonna pull him
he wasnt counting em was he
the mook with the streak
bernie shakes his head
larry sidles over
is there a problem
zero tolerance no theres no problem
fellas on a streak is all
re bernie let me guess
this is one of your coolers
why dont you announce it to the whole fucking joint
lowers his voice man they told me you were a stickler for the old ways
what is this guy some kind of degenerate gambler
reformed card shark
he doesnt look too effective to me
hes the best
take it from me
but there ways subtle ways to keep things in our favor
im talking more forward thinking methods
i suppose you got a whole fucking prospectus on the subject
as a matter of fact i do
like right off the bat i can tell you this wallpaper isnt going to cut it
its too uplifting
i would go with more muted tones
and personally i think the waitresses can all pop another button or two
myself i wouldnt hire anything less than a c cup
shelly looks to bernie
you believe this mook
larry extracts a cd from his jacket
know what this is
music to be sure
pleasant non intrusive
but blended in at a subsonic level is a mantra
and thats just skimming the surface
we really need to talk shelly
shelly is close to losing it
when morrie the manager of the paradise comes running up
shelly you better come quick
shelly larry and bernie following behind morrie as he hastily leads them down a hallway of the shangri las best suites
they arrive at an open door the sound of a television beckoning them inside
starting on the tv set lost horizon is playing
its the scene where robert conway ronald coleman his brother and maria are leaving the lost city in the end
conway looks back for one last tearful view of paradise
panning off the screen to a pair of naked feet on the floor next to the bed
revealing buddy slumped against the side of the mattress
a hypodermic needle protruding from his arm
death glaze fixated on the screen
bernie slumps back against the wall
catches his breath
shelly just stares at buddy a slight tremor of grief threatening his granite features
he glances over at larry who takes in buddys deathly repose without a hint of emotion
larry meets shellys eye with a subtle smirk of one upmanship
an incendiary beat passes between them
to morrie get a hold of his daughter
assist her with the arrangements
the shangri la will take care of everything
what about the paradise
she goes dark tonight
that wont be necessary
shelly and larry exchange looks again
bernie picks up on it
the tension in the room threatens nuclear fission
a loud animal roar reverberates on the soundtrack
accompanied by jungle like percussion
as we cut to a now performing poster on a metal stand johnny cappella live at the paradise lounge
panning off the sign and following a couple through the doors into the theater
our eye drawn to the stage
a troupe of gorgeous female dancers in leopard print g strings grinding their hips to the muscular rhythm
flanking them are a pair of strutting lions in elevated cages
an explosion of light and smoke
and johnny cappella makes his entrance
decked out in a reflective suit that picks up every light in the house and throws it back at the audience
johnnys got the style of a harry connick jr
and the moves of ricki martin
the energy this guy brings to the stage makes the last twenty years of buddy staffords reign seem like suspended animation
the women in the audience start fanning themselves with delight
its a new dawn in paradise
and the panties are coming fast and furious
we see shelly watching from the back of the room
he shifts his attention to nicky larry and marty at a primo table
theyre having a grand time
nicky pats larry on the back of the head
good work kid
larry turns and raises his drink to shelly
shelly stares right through him
a declaration of war
bernie and natalie wander around the midway
a middle aged worker at the ring toss booth gets her attention
over here young lady
cmon give it a try
eight for a dollar
natalie drags bernie over
she pays her money and the worker hands her the rings
natalie throws and misses all eight
the man pats her on the shoulder
sorry there sweetheart
better luck next time
wanna try again
natalie is about to take him up on it when she catches bernies eye
his look suggests shes being played for a sucker
she decides against it
they walk off down the midway
bernie chuckles to himself
youre just an easy mark is all
an easy mark
you never heard that term
natalie shakes her head
when we were kids shelly and me we used to work coney island during the summer
when a guy would walk up and seemed eager to open his wallet we would always mark him with chalk
wed pat him on the back or arm with the chalk
like hey buddy good job
pats natalie meanwhile he had no clue the other guys saw him coming a mile away
natalie looks down at her shoulder where the man patted her
she brushes it for effect
they take a seat at the end of the midway
natalie locks onto a little toe headed boy being dragged around by his older brother and the brothers friend
the kid has a glazed look in his eyes
natalie fixates on the boy with a haunted expression
bernie picks up on it
you notice last night that tattoo on my butt
are you kidding
yeah two twos
natalie hides her face behind her soda cup
looks off in the distance
i had a son
his name was joe
i was his mother for a year
you know you dont have to tell me this
i want to bernie
better you know the worst of me up front
later when im already invested in you itll be too hard to come clean
after i tell you this youll probably
i mean ill understand
she tears her eyes away from bernie
bernie cant believe what hes hearing
that she wants to be invested in him
what could be so bad
i gave my son up for adoption
i just wanted my life back
i was seventeen going on eighteen and i was selfish
my family they didnt want to have nothing to do with me after that
so i hitched a ride out here
figured i could make it as a showgirl
ten years later
shrugs starts to break up i like to think that if it happened when i was older with some guy i cared about maybe things would have been different
i think about my little joe
and i do know hes better off
im convinced of that
she lowers her soda
turns to bernie
he studies her for a lengthy beat stoic features
she wipes away her tears
oh well thats that
bernie stands up
focuses on the arcade clock
it reads a
he turns to her
so you wanna go try your hand at the dime pitch
its early still
off natalies tear filled features
she breaks into a laugh cry
bernie and natalie making love
natalie doesnt make with the oh yeah baby youre doing great encouragement
just some low key moans
bernie doesnt come too soon either
he outlasts sinatra through several cuts
in contrast we hear the hooker and her john howling away through the walls
an escalating ostinato of oh babys
until natalie reaches behind her and raps her fist against the wall
big smile from both of them
bernie and natalie returning from breakfast in bernies buick
bernie cant find a parking spot
natalie climbs out heads for the room
natalie arrives at the room
shes about to stab the key in the lock when she realizes the door is ajar
she hesitates for a moment then pushes it open
to find mikey and charlene waiting on them
charlene is puffing away on a marlboro when natalie enters
she immediately stubs it out
rises heads for the bathroom
i gotta go pee
im always peeing
she closes the door after her
to mikey how did you get in here
i told the desk clerk bernie was my old man
he let us wait inside
that a problem
bernies looking for a parking space
i musta taken the last one
mikey steps up to natalie
she hasnt moved from the doorway
her dislike for mikey is evident
tell me something natalie
is he paying you
my old man is he renting your ass
cause otherwise i just dont get it
a loser like my pops in the company of some primo t a
it dont compute
natalie doesnt dignify mikey with an answer
she stares him down unflinchingly
mikey reaches out to natalies ear pulls out a dollar chip
this enough to get me a taste
he drops the chip down natalies cleavage
natalie still doesnt react
mikey reaches up starts caressing her face
right then the door swings open
mikey snaps his fingers and a rose appears in his hand
he extends it to natalie
she ignores the gesture steps aside
i told you i was gonna stop by
i figured youd call ahead
we were out at breakfast
charlene emerges from the bathroom
natalie heads over
she doesnt want to be around mikey
she stops in front of charlene points to a sprinkling of white powder on the side of her nose
you missed some
charlene immediately swats the coke off
natalie enters the bathroom
closes the door
you see the thing is bernie were kinda strapped
i mean charly heres expecting like yesterday and we dont have the dough to make with the right nutrition for her an all
so i was wondering if you would care to invest a little in your grandchilds future
his well being
bernie scratches his head thinks on it for a moment or two
then heads over to the kitchenette cupboard
pulls down a coffee can
extracts a thick wad of bills
hands them over to mikey
theres about three grand there
thats all i got
bless you bernie
pats her belly you know michael i think we should name her bernadette
after your father
you mean bernie
trust me its a boy
bernie seems quite moved by it all
to bernie wanna feel her
i dont think
i dont want anything to hap
ooh i just felt her kick
cmon bernie gimme your hand
she places bernies hand over her stomach
not sure i dont know
i think so
mikey takes charlene by the arm
well catch you later bernie
i think im gonna take charly over to the hospital right now
get her checked up real good
charlene kisses bernie on the cheek
take care pop
mikey turns in the doorway eyebrows raised
youre not going to try anything stupid while youre in town
mikey plays it dumb
you mess up and theyll cut you no slack
thats all im saying
you got a kid to think about
mikey nods backs out of the room
they disappear into the parking lot
natalie emerges from the bathroom
she lights up a cigarette just stares at him as if to say sucker
shelly enters to find larry seated behind his desk
larry immediately leaps to his feet phony apologetic grin
nicky and marty are lounging on shellys sofa
shellys gaze is drawn to a table in the middle of the room
theres something on it covered in a plastic sheet
he raises a what gives
shelly i hope you dont mind
whats going on nicky
im sorry we didnt say nothing about this earlier
but the deal wasnt closed yet
dont worry shelly youre gonna love it
nicky gestures to larry
larry whisks the plastic sheet off the table
to reveal an impressive scale model of a redesigned shangri the model boasts huge snow capped himalayan peaks a la lost horizon surrounding a completely overhauled hotel and casino
a matterhorn like rollercoaster traverses the mountain top
gold and marbled pillars terraces and floors promise to raise the bar on las vegas opulence
were looking at a hundred million dollar investment easy
the new shangri la hotel and casino
we break ground on her in six months
off shellys startled expression i know what youre thinking
wheres she gonna go
you need space to expand right
well thats been taken care of
were now the proud owners of the golden frontier next door
gesturing to the model shes perfect
three floors of gaming imax theater entertainment center boutiques restaurants rollercoaster you name it
shell pay for herself in three years and then its easy money
isnt she great shell
shelly slowly approaches the model like a condemned prisoner mounting the scaffolding
we see his stoic features reflected in her sparkling swimming pool
in lost horizon these people their plane crashes in the himalayas and they get rescued and taken to this utopia in the mountains
the place is completely isolated
untouched by the outside world
theres no war no greed no bullshit
time is slowed down
people they dont age
thats what shangri la is
yeah weve all seen the movie
and your point is
shelly whirls around yells you dont fuck with paradise
hey jesus cmon shelly
were not trying to fuck with it
were trying to make it better
how nicky could it be any better
right now its perfect
its the last of its kind
points to the model weary this is just
its a mockery
trying to make something of it that it isnt
what are you talking about
its right outta the movie
whose talking about a fuckin movie
this aint a fuckin movie
this is my life
this is my house of worship
you people are shittin on all thats sacred to me
a tense silence ensues
nicky larry and marty exchange looks
tired laugh i got just one question
where you gonna be when they decide to change it back
when the people they come looking for the real vegas from before all this epcott center bullshit
whos gonna it give it to them
i dont think so
you know who
the same fucks who started this shit in the first place
its all gonna come full circle and bite you in the ass
mark my words
shelly falls silent
massages his forehead
shit that wasnt the way to handle it
nicky gets up from the sofa walks over to shelly places a hand on his shoulder
shelly flinches but doesnt pull away
you make some good points shelly
maybe itll swing back the other way who knows
but the smart money suggests we roll the dice
im not gonna bullshit you naturally theres gonna be a lot of restructuring in the months to come but i want you to know youll always have a place with
behind the bar
laughs behind the bar thats a good one
i think you should take some time and think things through
all this its a lot to digest yknow
speaking of things to digest im starving
hows that buffet they got in the valley of the blue moon
you recommend their prime rib shell
shelly stares right through marty
choke and die on it motherfucker
hey my arteries can use a workout
lead us to the trough shell
shelly nods at nicky then shifts his gaze to larry
larrys all smiles
he steps forward to join them his hand dropping down and caressing the surface of shellys desk behind him
a subtle gesture not lost on shelly
shelly mentally unloads a full chamber into larrys chest
returns the smile
as shelly and the group pass a hot craps table nicky is drawn to it
wait up a second
i thought we were gonna eat
only now do we see bernie has arrived to cool the table of its hot shooter a loud pudgy overdressed suburbanite
shelly eyes bernie
maybe we wanna play over there
nah lets play here
this is my lucky table
i always play here
to the others go on ahead
i know where to find you guys
shelly signals bernie to back off
bernie steps back
shelly larry and marty head for the restaurant
nicky quickly slaps down some green
the stickman slides the dice over to the suburbanite who is shooting
he scuttles the dice
they bounce up over the rail and spike nicky on the forehead before dropping back on the felt
the players chuckle
seven line away seven
nicky rubs his forehead glares at the suburbanite
he fires back
c mon pops
what the hell
i coulda paid my mortgage with the money i just lost
nicky says nothing
the table is quickly cleared by the dealers
the stickman skips the next shooter and feeds the dice to nicky
im supposed to be next
file a grievance shithead
suburbanite is still fuming over his loss
nicky places a couple hundred on the passline
were coming out
crap eleven any seven
nicky throws in some chips to the center
hundred dollar big red
suburbanite watches as nicky runs through a lengthy pre shot routine
lots of hand jive and cuff shooting
hurry it up gramps
your soups getting cold
crap ace deuce
the croupiers takes down the pass line
hey busketti maybe you should try shuffleboard
nicky is fed the dice again
nicky just fires an incendiary look back at the suburbanite
shakeem this direction
four hard four
the point is four
the players make their bets
good now throw it before you fucking keel over and die old man
nicky slowly starts his routine defiantly
happy birthday to me
happy birthday to me
jesus fuck im another year older already
nicky claps his hands dealer style for effect and with a gentlemanly smile steps back from the table
nickys chips are quickly swept up by the croupier
dont take it so hard pops
everybody craps out
nicky locks eyes with the suburbanite
then flashes a smile that suggests hes going to brush it off
he turns away from the table
now go change your fucking depends
nicky makes like its all in good jest
yeah thats real cute
he heads around the table to the suburbanite holds out his hand as if to say hey no hard feelings
the suburbanite shrugs
what the fuck
i was just playing with you pops
he reaches for nickys hand
when nicky suddenly headbutts him
before anyone can react nicky starts laying into the suburbanite
the man goes down and
nicky continues pummeling him
whos laughing now huh
cmon crack wise again
ya fuckin smooth as a ken doll no dick suburbanite scum
hows that for a game
shelly alerted to the fracas rushes back to the table
he takes immediate control of the situation
snaps his fingers at security
the suburbanite is whisked away with a pocketful of comps and a bruised ego
shelly takes nicky aside attempts to calm him
nicky keeps railing at shelly that aint right shelly
guy fucks up my game like that
who the fuck does he think he is
hes just a piece of shit
forget about him
i thought this joint had more class
used to be we wouldnt even let bums like that in
nicky catches himself
he looks at shelly for a beat
theres an unspoken understanding between them
the good old days
we see bernie in the b
looking more than a bit shocked
bernie seated with natalie
you know natalie all i want to do is go some place where i can tell day from night
where they got clocks on the wall
i cant breathe around here no more
four days and im gone
im not even sure i can hold out that long
a beat so where does that leave us
a week ago i didnt remember what it was like to have a womans hands on me
im still pinching myself expecting to wake up from
just blurts it out come with me natalie
i want you to come with me
god bernie thats
i didnt mean to spring that on you
i want to be with you
but i dont know if i can leave with you
bernies look why
i was working on a compatibility chart for the two of us
and it looks good really it does
so whats the problem
thats with us here
bernies expression oh
maybe i was being presumptuous cause i knew you were leaving
and i tried working it in different ways
it wasnt good bernie
i got scared
but thats just for now for the immediate future
once the planets realign maybe a year from now
not another year
not another week
a somber mood falls on the table
bernie reaches for natalies hand
instead he knocks the salt over
it spills out in front of them
we probably shouldnt see each other anymore
we only got a couple days left together
why not make the most of them
a long beat because if i spend one more night in your arms im not going anywhere
and thats so bad
bernie just stares at her shrouded in sadness
natalie stubs out her cigarette rises
take care bernie
bernie casts his eyes to the mound of spilled salt in front of him
a few beats later he raises his head
a waitress appears
get you another
nods i think you better bring me the bottle
once again we see bernies feet limp across the casino floor
he walks up to the bar asks for a cup of coffee
doris brings it over
short on the cream again
he just sips it black
gloom and doom features
his masters voice sounds over the intercom chang party of fifteen your table is ready chang party of fifteen
bernie looks to doris
only three more days
he heads for the crap tables the sound of raucous cheering becomes audible
a large crowd starting to gather
bernie noodles his way to the front of the crowd
as soon as he gets a look at the heavy hitter at the table he tenses up
charlene is making one hell of a racket
playing up her extremely maternal state
just then natalie sidles up to bernie with the chivas regal
without thinking about it he grabs the glass off the tray downs it in a single gulp
clutching her tummy come on mikey
this is our future
dont blow it
mikey throws down a bet for the dealer
put this on the line for the boys
the stickman thanks him as they place the bet
mikey throws down more money
we can see mikey has bets all over the table
dealers got shoes
hands high the dice are out
the point is nine
come on all yous
put a good thought in for our baby
as everyone dotes over charlene mikey quickly swaps the dice before anyone can see
six the hard way
mikey is paid nine thousand by the croupier as is charlene
bernie stands frozen
he doesnt bother trying to get any closer to the table
he knows itll do no good
oh my god i just felt him kick
he knows youre all pulling for him
god bless you all
natalie looks over at charlene
their eyes meet for a second
its as though natalie knows its a scam and charlenes acknowledging it
mikey throws again
six the hard way
look out we got a shooter
another nine grand
mikeys rail is nearly full
charlene hops around awkwardly causing more distraction
bernie is really sweating it out now
then shelly arrives
larry is hot on his tail
eighteen thousand since i stepped up
im sorry shelly i guess ive been hit and miss lately
shellys expression tells us he isnt so sure
something definitely isnt kosher
as charlene chatters on mikey switches the dice back
shelly makes him
sotto fucking amateurs
the players and crowd though disappointed applaud mikeys achievement
bowing i thank you
my wife thanks you
my unborn child thanks you
mikey moves his rail of chips to the felt
color me up will ya
larry notices shelly slipping on a pair of leather gloves
youve gotta be kidding me
off shellys steely glare thats not how i propose we handle it
well turn the matter over to the authorities
theyll be blacklisted their credit ruined
gets in larrys face and then well give em both a lollipop for the ride home
come watch and learn harvard
a little lesson on how to protect your investment the old school way
shelly walks over to mikey and charlene larry lingering behind him
hey that was some run you had back there
just lucky i guess
mikey steals a tense glance at charlene
she starts to fidget nervously
why dont we go do this in my office
i dont like to hand out all this amount of cash on the floor
security tony and lou corrals the couple
leads them away
bernie watches as they pass by
mikey looks into bernies eyes
they both know hes been made
natalie doesnt say anything just looks at bernie
slot machines everywhere some on the way out some on the way in
crates of casino supplies
bernie rushes in with natalie behind him
heading for an aural beacon of blows landing on flesh
grunting arriving to find tony and lou kicking the shit out of mikey on the floor
charlene lies clutching her belly a few feet away
shelly swings a baseball bat warming up for some blood sport
larry watches from the sidelines at once appalled and enthralled
oh my god
i can feel the contractions coming on
bernie rushes over to shelly
shelly stop them
dont do this
get lost bernie this got nothing to do with you
its got everything to do with me
hes my son
everyone stops dead
shelly gets a weird look in his eye
a fuse has just been lit
what did you say
i said hes my who
this little prick
shelly smashes mikey across the shoulder with the bat
shelly raises the bat to cream mikey again
bernie grabs shellys arm
shelly shoves him back
raises the bat again
pop help me
shelly dont you fucking do it
he lowers the bat throws it aside
grabs bernie by his collar
were you in on this
jesus you better come clean with me
i didnt know nothing about it
shelly releases bernie
theres a strange look in shellys eye
we see the wheels turning
how much you think their lives are worth bernie
myself i dont think theyre worth piss
but hey it aint my kid
bernie sees where shellys going with this
we can almost hear the cell door slamming in his head
let me see they were up almost a hundred and fifty grand
thats gs someones gonna have to account for
what do you say bernie seventy five grand a piece
bernie glances over at natalie
she has tears in her eyes
he looks to shelly pleadingly
please dont do this
hey i know you dont have that kind of cash
but since youre a friend of the house im willing to front you
shelly they didnt get away with the money
you didnt lose anything
shelly glances over at lou nods
lou kicks mikey in the face
his nose snaps like a twig
its on me
charlene clutches her belly moans
oh god oh god
you gotta get me to the hospital
shelly please help her
thats my grandson
hey why dont we all break out the champagne
lootz is about to become a granddaddy
walks over to her how you doin there sweetheart
must hurt like crap huh
nods hurts so bad
suddenly shelly kicks charlene in the belly
she screeches out
even shellys goons cant believe what theyve just witnessed
larry is aghast
bernie rushes shelly starts raining blows on him
shelly swats him off
he drops down next to the squirming girl rips her sweater and blouse up over her stomach
to reveal a mound of fake padding
he tears the padding away from her throws it at bernie
its a fuckin boy
anyone got a cigar
the muscle start laughing it up
larry emits a nervous giggle
natalies jaw hits the floor
bernie takes a step back
hes about to go into serious shock
charlene curls over sobbing
to bernie you sure you still want to be good for it
because if you want to change your mind i dont blame you
bernie looks over at mikey
he stares up at his father trembling
ill make it up to you pop i swear
bernie holds his sons gaze for a beat
hes almost tempted to
he just shrugs and nods at shelly
its on me
shakes his head thats the worst fucking call you ever made in your life
on natalie at that moment
we can tell she agrees with shelly
but thinks all the more of bernie for it
that might even be love in her eyes
shelly snatches his baseball bat up off the floor
walks over to mikey and brings it down full force pulverizing mikeys left kneecap
oh man the scream
what are you doing
i thought we had gs buys their lives
this is just a little slap on the wrist to remember me by
natalie turns her head
shes about to throw up
larry watches unflinchingly
charlene is making with some serious pleading now
it wasnt my idea
shelly steps up to charlene tapping the base of the bat in the palm of his hand
he smiles reassuringly at her
you know motherhood is a beautiful thing
you made a mockery out of it
maybe youll get to experience it for real one day
nods sobbing i want
to be a mother
please dont hurt me
im not going to hurt you
shelly turns his back on her
charlene starts sobbing relief
theyre not going to hurt her
its going to be all right
shelly throws the bat to lou
the heavy steps up to the plate as we rack focus to shelly walking away crunch
followed by the girls shrieks
natalie buries her head in bernies shoulder
to tony and lou get em outta here
you ever see them in this joint again kill em
to bernie and natalie you two youre still on shift
shelly catches larrys eye i hope you were taking notes
bernies seated on the edge of his bed drowning his sorrows with a bottle of gin
moonlight paints him in jail bars of shadow
natalie lingers in the b
i did this to myself
i planted the seed
when angela took off with mikey i didnt
i never made an effort to get back in his life
i figured the kid dont need a loser for a father
now its all come full circle
i give him the money i open the door to all this
i musta had it coming
natalies hand lowers the needle onto the sinatra record
nice n easy starts up
she walks over to bernie takes the bottle away
helps him to his feet
he gives himself over to her reassuring embrace
natalie raises bernies face to hers
bernie its a big world out there
if you just took off if we took off
bernie shakes his head
its too late for that now
natalie staring up at the ceiling bernie nuzzled against her
her features appear softer than ever
luminous in the moonlight
realization moist in her eyes
you awake bernie
he grunts something inaudible
i think i love you
bernie tenses up
no i dont think
im pretty certain of it
bernie raises his head not quite sure he heard her right
natalie sits up hugs her knees
bernie finds himself staring at her back
you blind sided me bernie lootz
i never saw this coming
you shouldnt do that to a girl
bernie reaches out caresses her back
she emits a shiver
theres still things you dont know
i dont want to ruin it
bernie pulls natalie back toward him
it wont make any difference natalie
whatever you come clean about im not gonna feel any different about you
id say the words but with my luck
say em anyway
to hell with rotten luck
a beat i love you natalie
natalie smothers her lips against bernies
he enshrouds her in his arms
fade into soft focus
slowing taking form
a cats face seen in extreme close up
wider to reveal the cat resting on bernies chest
she meows as he stirs awake
hes stunned to see her there
the cat jumps off his chest and slinks over to her empty food bowl
bernie breaks into a wide smile
you came back
bernie shields his eyes from the bright sunlight streaming in through the blinds
this is a first for him
hes never gotten direct sunlight in his room before
whats the deal
did the world just turn on its axis
he glances over his shoulder
just her impression in the sheets
and a note on her pillow
for a moment his heart stops
he conjures up the worst
grabs up the note unfolds it
we see a lipstick kiss and the words have a spectacular bernie lets out a joyful whoop
leaps out of bed
close up trixie eating some tuna out of her bowl
we hear the record player needle drop on luck be a lady
cut to bernies feet gliding around the room
pan up to bernie dancing with himself
hes positively aglow
he snatches up a salt shaker and sings along with sinatra
its true love makes the world go around
it obviously also gives life to dead plants as evidenced by the small bulb that has sprung up overnight above his radiator
but we wont dwell on that
bernie struts into the casino a changed man still to the tune of luck be a lady
even his limp seems less pronounced as he greets fellow workers as they pass
he catches a glimpse of himself in a wall mirror
maybe for the first time he likes what he sees
in the reflection he notices natalie smiling at him
he meets her eyes
she averts them quickly keeps walking
shelly watches bernie from the video monitor
he appears less than delighted over bernies sunny disposition
he picks up the phone dials
into phone yeah its me
get bernie over to crap table six
per usual bernie walks up to the bar asks for a cup of coffee
doris slides it over
looking around got any cre before he can answer doris hands him a container of cream
a full container
taken aback he starts pouring it into his cup when he hears a voice over the intercom lovett party of six your table is ready lovett party of six
bernie looks to doris
a bernie arrives at a hundred dollar blackjack table just in time for the dealer to bust out
the crowd goes crazy
b bernie takes a break by leaning up against the side of a slot machine
suddenly the woman playing it hits a jackpot
c everywhere he seems to go people continue to win
d bernie despite the spooky irony cant help but smile as mountains of chips pile up on the tables
shelly appears behind him
not a happy camper
he gestures bernie to follow him
they head over to a section of slots
as they pass one of those huge million dollar slots the floor manager cuts in front of them
hey shelly check it out
the new mega million
i call her marnie cause shes one frigid broad
sure once in a while shell flash you a bit of tit but your chances of hitting a home run one in twenty million
here give her a shot
he hands shelly a cup of quarters takes off
shelly looks to bernie
hes trying to keep a lid on his anger
feeding marnie quarters you wanna tell me whats going on out there
i dont know
shelly pulls the lever
what do you mean
marnie immediately spits out a small jackpot
reacts with surprise what do you mean you dont know
were down almost a mil out there
doesnt seem strange to you
shrugs guess im having an off day
you dont have off days lootz
youre shitty luck incarnate
you coming down with something
youve got this look about you
shelly starts feeding marnie again
fact is ive never felt better
whats that supposed to mean
she loves me shelly
she told me last night
on the mention of natalies name we hear a shrieking siren followed by a deafening toll of slot bells
shellys just landed the million dollar jackpot
shelly stares at the slot in surprise then looks over at bernie
realization hits hard
the floor manager staggers over
his expression is priceless
you popped her cherries
several casino workers have gathered to witness the deflowering of marnie
they gaze reverently upon her as if witnessing the close encounters mothership for the first time
shelly drags bernie out of earshot
she told you she loves you
bernie nods a huge grin wrenching his cheeks apart
hes about to go helium on us
natalies serving drinks to a table of high rollers when tony and lou appear behind her
the door to shellys office slams behind natalie
shelly glares at her from behind his desk
we see him thumbing his steel abacus
the beads drifting toward the center
natalie shakily lights up a cigarette
put that fucking thing out
natalie startled drops her cigarettes
she kneels to gather them up
you should be
youve gone and fucked it up big time
i paid you to be his cooze companion not his fucking true love
but no you had to go and get all profound on the poor schmuck
mimics female voice i love you bernie
you know what youve gone and done sweetheart
those four little words of endearment have already cost this casino a million and counting today
i dont understand
jumps to his feet lady luck
you never hearda lady luck
thats whats goin on out there
lootz is kryptonite on a stick
he should have em throwing ice cubes out there but instead i got a fuckin meltdown on my hands
shelly walks around his desk to natalie
ok heres whats gonna happen
youre outta his life by the time he gets home
dont even tell him to his face just leave a note
ill make some calls situate you at another joint
i cant do that
right in her face excuse me
it wasnt an act
i meant it
i love him
close to losing it whats there to fuckin love
hes a loser

i thought you were his friend
and i thought you were a smart cookie when i picked you out
you do not want to fuck me over darlin
ill see to it that your next johns a rattlesnake out in the desert
now get the fuck outta here
natalie rushes from the office in tears
shelly closes his eyes for a moment gotta keep it together
bernie approaches some cocktail waitresses about to go off duty
any of you seen natalie around
im supposed to give her a ride home
i think she left already
she wasnt feelin too good
we been covering for her
off bernies expression oh
bernies buick pulls into the lot
he parks heads for his room
flips on the light
calls to the bathroom natalie
you in there
he heads over
finds it empty
concern spreads across his features
he glances around the room
notices the closet wide open
natalies clothes missing
thats when he catches sight of the note taped to the dresser mirror
he rushes over rips it off
bernie slumps to the floor in disbelief
starts to tremble
then rocks back and forth wracked by stifled sobs
christ make it stop hurting
bernie seated at the foot of the bed drinking bourbon from a solitary glass
hes almost gone through an entire bottle
he glances down notices a pair of natalies stockings sticking out from under the bed
he brings them up to his face
breathes her in only to exhale a sorry breath
bernie stops at the bar for a cup of coffee
doris starts to pour the cream
par for the course
time to go to work
we see bernie back in top form
cool hes turned into mr
freeze with a vengeance
the high rollers are facing a nuclear winter on the floor thanks to bernie
a a man with a fresh bankroll sits at a card table full of hubris
bernie pulls up a chair next to him
b we see a crowd of players hovering over a busy craps table
the cheerful congregation turns sour as the dice are flung
players groan as they jettison the table leaving just bernie
c we see a dealer pull a six card twenty one as players sit with twelves and thirteens
they sit stunned as their money is swept away
the same man with the hefty bankroll unclips the last of his green
he throws it over to the dealer to change in
d larry roaming the floor is visibly disturbed by bernies cooling ability
its something he cant quantify and it unsettles him
he glances up toward shellys observation window knows the man is gloating
from behind the glass shelly lights up a stogey
hint of a smile
you go bernie
johnny cappella rocks the house
pan across to shelly and bernie seated in shellys booth
shelly is in a jovial mood while bernie is a portrait of misery
i want you to tell me the truth shelly
did you say something to natalie
did you muscle her jesus bernie is that what you think of me
that i would fuck with your happiness
bernie shrugs an apology shifts his gaze to johnny cappella
this guys all flash
i miss buddy
place isnt the same without him
buddy was tired
i gave him an easy out
it coulda been a lot worse
confused you gave him an easy out
what are you talkin about
i thought he
shelly looks almost
something he needs to get off his chest
he woulda never taken the buy out offer
buddy woulda stuck to his guns no matter what
and they woulda ended up hurting him
i couldnt let that happen
how can you sit here and justify it
like you were dr
kevorkian or something
listen to me you dumb fuck i loved that sonofabitch
but his time was up
what i was supposed to do leave him to those corporate wolves
what i did it was the humanitarian thing
that i have no doubt about
afterwards i held him in my arms and i cried like a fucking baby
you got this look whats this fucking look
off bernies shocked expression bernie sits watching tv a bottle of ten high next to him on the bed
same religious channel
this time its a mass baptism taking place on some river bank
hes about to doze off when he hears a light rapping on the door
he cocks his head not sure if its the booze talking
bernie throws open the door natalie standing there
a lonely angel framed in the doorway
suitcase at her feet
carat tears glistening in the dark
they just stare at each other for an extended beat
then natalie stumbles into bernies arms
clingwraps herself to him
bernie squeezes his eyes closed
holds on for dear life
its a different kind of pain now one that hurts so good
from over bernies shoulder
theres a bittersweet look about her
nothing good can come of this
but thats tomorrow
a long ways off
bernie and natalie lie in each others arms
bernie seems at ease
natalie eyeballs the ceiling smoke wisping up from a cigarette
lets just take off
bernie looks over at her
i mean it
lets just pack up and go
closes his eyes i cant do that
ive got an obligation to shelly
theres no fuck shelly
he doesnt give a shit about you
lets just climb into your car and get the hell out of here
bernie cuts her off
i cant do that natalie
theyd come after me
and because you were with me
i wouldnt want that on me
natalie finishes her cigarette
well shes made her bed
bernie starts nuzzling her
she turns away
just hold me
shelly looking on as a high roller cleans up at craps
with bernie standing right there next to the guy
which only seems to make it worse as bernies presence spurs the player on to an even bigger win
bernie has that goofy my heart is full look about him
which can mean only one thing in shellys book
the man looks about ready to split an atom
we see larry hovering nearby with a smug grin
off of shellys enraged expression
lous black oldsmobile pulls into the parking lot
shelly and the boys climb out head for
natalies sunning herself at the pool
the only other people around are a middle aged couple and a young boy
shelly slipping on his leather gloves followed by lou and tony strides purposefully up to natalie no hellos nothing just grabs her by the hair
what are you
he drags natalie over to bernies room kicks the door open shoves natalie inside
shelly throws natalie onto the bed
lou closes the door and draws the blinds
you got no fucking right
what did i tell you
what did i fuckin tell you
i dont give a fuck
shelly heads over to the closet rips it open pulls out a suitcase
he starts throwing natalies clothes into the case
youre gone sweetheart
kiss paradise goodbye
hysterical i cant leave
i love him
doesnt that mean anything to you you heartless fuck
shelly stops packing
he grabs natalie up off the bed starts smacking her around
who the fuck do you think you are
you aint nobody
i could make you disappear like this
snaps his fingers and nobody would ever notice you were gone
yells bernie would
i got friends
you dont fuckin own me
you got no right shelly lifts natalie up throws her across the room into the dresser mirror
she crumbles to the floor glass showering her
natalie grabs up a shard rushes shelly with it
she slashes shelly across the arm
before tony and lou can make a move shelly ensnares her wrist snaps it backwards aarrrrgghhh
shelly snatches up the shard shoves her back on the bed
we see her terror reflected in the jagged glass against her cheek
you fuckin cunt
he slices her cheek open
tony and lou look on with mutual expressions shellys getting a little carried away here
shelly staggers to his feet
you think thats bad
thats just a taste bitch
youre still here when bernie gets home and ill finish the job
ill cut you into so many fuckin pieces the vulturesll be trading on you for a month
shelly reaches into his jacket pulls out a wad of bills
throws them at natalie
go get yourself some cosmetic surgery
shelly gestures to tony and lou
they exit the room leaving natalie sobbing into one of bernies pillows
heads for his room
hes about to reach for his key when he realizes the door is slightly ajar
he pushes his way into
bernie fumbles for the light switch
ive got a headache
closing the door did you take something
i got some aspirin in the yeah
i already took something
theres just enough moonlight in the room for bernie to make out natalie curled over on the bed
as he approaches he trips over natalies suitcase on the floor
he cuts himself on a splinter of shattered glass as he staggers to his feet
which draws his attention to the mirror
moonlight glows off the edges
thats all there is edges
on the dresser his bottle of ten high
confused bernie fumbles his way over to natalie on the bed
natalie what happened
he reaches out to touch her face
instead his hand makes contact with a lump
he jerks back flips on the nightstand lamp
bernie chokes at the sight of her
she clutches a bloody rag to her cheek
blood on the pillow
blood on the sheets
natalie who did this to you
we need to call the police
i love you bernie
i just want you to know that
i fell in love with you
that wasnt part of the plan
what are you saying
he paid me to get next to you
to keep you around
whatever it took
a whisper shelly
you got it right the first night
i was for sale
bought and paid for
you were the easy mark bernie
bernie slumps down on the edge of the bed
trying to make sense of it
at first you were just another john
but then i started to take a closer look
for the first time here was someone who wasnt trying to hustle me
wasnt pretending to be somebody he wasnt
just a decent guy trying to get back on track
and it didnt hurt any that you put me up on a pedestal
it sure puts the gutter into perspective
still in disbelief shelly
shelly wants me gone
he says i bring you luck
to tell you to your face
and then you wouldnt want me no more
and i could just go
bernie stands shakily
we gotta get you to the hospital
well talk about this later
just tell me one thing bernie
tell me theres gonna be a later
bernie doesnt answer her
fade in on bernies hunched over figure waiting on natalie
he tugs at his car keys as he wrestles with his emotions
natalies betrayal has finally sunken in
the mans in pain
his natural instinct is to just take off
fuck this whole goddamn town
suddenly he looks up
a couple of people pass by in front of him
and then there she is
standing a few feet away face patched up arms clutching herself not sure whether to approach him or not
the sight of her just breaks bernies heart
he stands slowly legs like jelly and in that instant its all so clear to him
he walks over forgiveness in his eyes contrition in hers
she tries to say something
he shakes his head
they embrace with an intensity that threatens to merge their atoms into a single being
bernie drives down a quiet vegas street
almost too quiet
all the lights are green as they cruise into the night
tell me again bernie
tell me its all gonna be okay
everythings gonna be fine
this is our time
this is you and me and were going for it
natalie leans over and kisses him
as she does so she catches sight of her face in the mirror
starts to tear up
you look in the mirror you dont like what you see dont believe it
you look in my eyes
thats the only mirror you gonna need
look in my eyes natalie
she looks into bernies eyes
sees the most beautiful girl in the world
tears roll down her cheeks
i love you
off natalies startled reaction
boom down as bernie carries natalie out of the chapel their lips fused together
bernie and natalie burn down the highway
the lights of the big city just a glimmer in the rearview
up ahead a billboard reads the shangri la hotel and casino
tight on bernie
his expression turns grim
natalie picks up on it
she shakes her head
silently pleading bernie no
bernie tries to shrug it off
but the spectre of shelly sits firmly on his shoulder
theres no escaping him
we see bernie fighting it
in the next instant bernie pulls a quick u turn across the middle shoulder starts back toward vegas
bernie pulls into the parking lot
kills his lights
bernie reaches for the door
natalie grabs his arm
you dont have to do this bernie
yeah i do
i have to tell him right to his face
i will not look over my shoulder for the rest of my life our lives
bernie your chart
that first night
i wasnt being straight with you
its the worst chart ive ever seen
theres nothing in the cards for you
dont you see that was before you opened your heart to me
everythings different now
i got lady luck on my side
aint nothing gonna happen to me
natalie shakily opens her purse pulls out a handful of hundreds
pushes the money at bernie
its three thousand dollars
maybe shellyll accept it as a down payment
we can send him the rest in installments
after we get settled
i dont think take it
bernie stuffs the cash in his jacket
whatever happens i abrupt i know bernie
she turns away
stares out the window tears streaming down her cheeks
sotto gentle i know
bernie makes for the paradise lounge
split second flashback as he imagines shelly laying into natalie
reverberating sound echoes
just the fuel bernie needs to make his stand
by the time he arrives at hes practically foaming at the mouth with rage
he barges in to find shelly at a table in agitated conversation with nicky larry and marty
they fall silent realizing something is wrong
bernie whats the matter
you look a little fucking spooked
bernie throws something in shellys face
its that bloody rag natalie was holding to her cheek
it lands on the table in front of everyone
shelly swats it away with disgust
jumps to his feet
bernie slugs him one
as shelly doubles over bernie gets in his face
you lay another finger on her i swear to god ill kill you
you hear me
ill fuckin kill you
shellys goons quickly move in grab bernie
drag him away
shelly composes himself turns to his guests
will you excuse me for a moment
he rushes off
nicky shoots larry a resigned look
lou shoves bernie inside
bernie kisses floor
shelly strides past leans against his desk
bernie slowly drags himself to his feet
a hoarse whisper why
because you never give up a good thing bernie
you are a good thing
the best fuckin cooler there ever was
and i need him back
he aint never comin back
thats a dead man talking
im through with this joint shelly
natalie and me we just got married

ill get a job out there in the world

shellys expression oh yeah

and maybe you had it all along

this place your legacy its a mirage
you turn your back and it dont even exist
theres no day theres no night its all just one big fuckin blur and it dont count for nothin
shelly looks to tony and lou you believe this fuckin guy
bernie gets eye to eye with shelly
i feel real sorry for you
yeah you got this fear of germs thing
but it goes deeper than that
you cant get close to no one
on an emotional level
youre the worst kind of gambler there ever was too scared to put his chips on the table
too scared to open his heart
to extend any real kinda friendship
always afraid its gonna end out in the desert
well sweet fuckin dreams pal cause im out and if thats where it ends thats where it ends
bernie turns his back on shelly strides over to the door
thats a real heartfelt speech lootz
all that jimmy stewart in ya face intensity
you almost sold me
massages his throat man ive got a fucking lump in my throat
a beat but it still dont change things
you bail on me without making good on my gs and im gonna be forced to close the books on you
you and the broad
you leave me no choice
bernie turns looks at shelly
shellys dead serious
they hard stare each other for a beat
bernie doesnt say anything
at least not out loud
his eyes do all the talking i guess you leave me no choice either
hold on bernies steely resolve
this could be the opening of the film bernie standing with his back to us facing the gold elevator doors
the floor lights ascending fast
the doors open and the soundtrack goes silent
slow push in on him as he takes in the action a gladiator about to enter the coliseum
something comes alive in his eyes
a spark of determination
this is not the expression of a loser
close up as his foot steps onto the casino floor an explosion of amplified casino walla shatters the previous silence
we follow bernie as he wanders through the casino like hes done a thousand times but this time with conviction
bernie steps up to an empty table throws down the whole three grand onto the felt
the crew working the table stop down as they realize who it is
the table is dead
bernie couldnt be needed
the croupier slowly gathers up the green hands it to the boxman
check change three thousand
the boxman counts the cash
this a pleasure cruise bernie
you could say that
well itll be a short one
it is now anyway
the others chuckle
the boxman counts out the chips theyre given to bernie
he places them all on the passline
the stickman pushes over the dice
bernie picks a couple
pay the line
bernie picks up his three thousand dollars in winnings
he lets it ride
the table quickly fills up with hungry players
bernie throws the dice again
bernie is now paid six thousand dollars on his pass line bet
the other players also collect their winnings
they can feel something in the air
bernie forehead beaded with sweat rubs the felt a little before he picks up the dice
easy way six
bernie takes double odds on his bet
the boxman isnt sure what to do
does he stop him
does he dare
in the b
people gather to watch the action
whatever it is its catching
the table next to them bursts into applause
a close on a slot machine as it pays out
the woman grabs the payout feverishly
b a group at the blackjack table cheers as the dealer busts out
c the line at the cashier cage gets longer and longer
stacks and stacks of chips being meticulously counted
d a quick shot of a roulette ball dropping into number twenty one
the dealer slowly puts the marker atop a large stack of chips in the twenty one square
a shot of the faces of frenzied dice players waiting for the outcome of the throw
followed by a thunderous release as the point is made
in the center of it all
his rail is nearly full of chips
the other players pat him on the back and shake his hand as the croupiers busily pay the line
hes a winner
and its infectious
hes gone and contaminated the entire casino
the slots are ringing out of control
moans of delight
this much excitement threatens to take the fucking roof off
bernie just gazes around in amazement
if only natalie could see him now
this is you
bernie takes a thousand dollars in chips tosses it gently to the croupier
for the boys
the entire crew stop for a moment out of respect
they all nod as the boxman locks up the tip money
okay were coming out
get your yo bets c e any seven
shelly sits alone in his office nursing a glass of scotch listening to some scratchy chet baker on the turntable
he looks pre occupied
bernies assessment of his life having hit home
suddenly the door is thrown open
shelly take a look at number
shelly wanders up slowly to find bernie at the center of the crowd
he steps behind the table into the casino pit to get a closer look
to the boxman how much is he up
the boxman looks up nervously
around three hundred thousand
shelly mouths the words under his breath
why didnt one of you fucking geniuses call me
you werent picking up
besides it was bernie
the game resumes
were coming out folks hands high
everybody quiets down to listen
color me up a hundred fifty thousand
beat and give it to him
bernie points to shelly standing in the pit
the crowd watches the drama play out
thats what i owe you shelly
there it is
to the table let it be known bernie lootz lives up to his obligations
the boxman colors up a hundred fifty thousand in chips lays them out on the table
he counts it and claps his hands together for the cameras
one hundred fifty thousand coming in
shelly stands motionless
staring into bernies eyes
the whole crowd watches
after what seems like an eternity shelly nods
then the boxman feeds the chips in with the others
a moment later we can nary tell they were ever gone
larry appears next to shelly
nicky and marty watching from the sidelines dour expressions
whats the matter with you
hes one of ours and hes taking us to the fucking cleaners
lootzs off the clock
as long as hes off the clock hes free to play
just like every other schmuck in this joint
it smells wrong
im shutting him down
hes not leaving here with a dime shelly suddenly jabs larry in the throat with the tips of his fingers
larry gasps starts to cave
shelly keeps him upright escorts him to a nearby mens room
nicky and marty looking on in amazement
the door flies open larry catapults into frame
bounces off the wall
shellys right behind him
he drags larry to his feet
slams him into the wall again gets right up in his face
now you listen real good you harvard turd
lootz is on the up and up
he leaves here tonight with whatever he comes out with
you so much as touch a hair on his head and ill fucking wallpaper this joint with your ass
muted tones right
slams him hard whats that
i dont hear nothing
wait a minute yeah now i hear it
blended in at a subsonic level
some kinda mantra pain pain pain
shelly headbutts larry
its like the sound of a walnut cracking
larry slumps to the floor
shelly takes a deep breath
control control control
he heads over to the sink washes his hands over and over
larry moaning in the b
shelly adjusts his tie in the mirror
shelly exits the mens room makes his way back to the craps table where bernie is
just in time to see bernie lay twenty five grand on the pass line
a waitress hands a drink off to bernie
he takes a healthy swig
then picks up the dice
crap ace deuce
the crowd gasps in horror as bernies twenty five grand is quickly raked in
he replaces it with another stack of chips
the dice are pushed over to him
he rubs the felt real gently before throwing
then lets loose the dice
all eyes follow the dice
they hit the felt and bounce around behind a stack of chips
the stickman cant spot them
a croupier makes the call as anxious players rubberneck to get a look
the crowd groans again
it appears the streak is over
bernie looks out over the felt
this is his moment of truth
he unloads his entire rail and puts it on the field
he yells out
fifty thousand dollars
the crowd chimes in with every opinion under the sun
on the field
whatre you fucking nuts
dont do it
shake it dont break it baby
the dice are slowly pushed over to bernie
the crowd is feeling it
the entire casino is feeling it
bernie lets out a long soulful sigh
his whole life depends on the next throw and everyone knows it
bernie rubs the felt as usual and lines up the dice to show a six and a six
he picks them up
come on sixty six
locks eyes with shelly then lets loose
the dice fly from his hand
slowly ever so slowly we watch them sail across the table
the entire table holds their breath in anticipation
bernie throws open the doors stumbles out
his limp seems more pronounced
he wears a miserable expression
at the car bernie steps up
opens the door slides in behind the wheel
natalie throws her arms around him
i thought for sure
bernie just looks at her
pale mournful features
its okay right
you guys worked it out
he took the three grand
tell me its okay bernie
he doesnt answer
just starts up the car
on the surveillance monitors the epidemic continues players winning at every table
the shangri las been wiped out
theres no way they can cover this amount of winning action
panning across to shelly
the phone rings incessantly in the b
shelly ignores it
lou pokes his head into the office want me to get that shelly
shelly doesnt respond
he reaches into his desk drawer for that bottle and a glass
is about to pour himself a shot
pushes the glass aside
takes it straight from the bottle
the phone keeps ringing
on the scale model of the newly proposed shangri la
hold on it
a chair enters frame shatters paradise
wider shelly trashing the model with a vengeance
kicking the debris around the office
drenched in sweat shelly staggers over to his desk
swats the empty gin bottle to the floor
picks up his disinfectant spray gives his desk one last wipedown
stands walks out
we see the lights of the city receding in bernies rearview mirror
once outside of the city limits bernie pulls the car over
what are you stopping for
bernie throws open his door
i think im gonna
and he does
its as if hes choking up the entire city
everything thats bad about it
finally he pulls himself back into the car
slams the door
natalie touches his cheek a reassuring look in her eyes
suddenly hes smiling
he opens his coat and a huge wad of cash tumbles out
he throws it up into the air
natalie almost chokes with surprise
bahamas here we come baby
she throws her arms around him
suddenly an explosion of light
in the hand of a motorcycle cop
he raps on the window
step out of the car please
lowers the window whats the problem officer
the cop runs the flashlight over the bundles of cash littering the car interior
just step out of the car please
both of you
bernie and natalie exchange unsettled looks
the cop lowers his hand to his gun
bernie nods at natalie
they climb out
he directs them off to the side
shines his light in their faces
if my driving
if i was going a little fast i was just over excited officer
see we just had a big win at the shangri la you didnt win nothing
the cop pulls out his revolver trains it on them
shelly opens the door to his cadillac
climbs behind the wheel
his keys are already waiting in the ignition
whos gonna steal shelly kaplows car right
shelly doesnt start her up
he just leans back in his seat emits a deep sigh
he glances up at the rearview mirror
catches sight of a silhouette in the back
bernie and natalie staring into the barrel of the cops revolver
natalie clutches bernies arm
so there you have it
oh jesus bernie i knew it
it was too good to be true
who were we kidding
get down on your knees
both of you
they look at him in shock
he gestures them to the ground behind bernies car
we cut to a shot from the highway just the cop standing at the tail end of bernies car natalie and bernie hidden from view
down on their knees
bernie places his arm around natalie pulls her close to him
paralyzed with terror she still manages a bittersweet smile
bernie should be projecting fear but theres nothing but his overwhelming love for natalie in his eyes
its a two way current
this is their last moment together everything that needs to be said is being transmitted through a look
a look that says no regrets
nicky leans forward out of the shadows
shelly holds his gaze in the mirror
nicky just shrugs
the kid wants you should know shelly hes just protecting our investment the old school way
see you around
he knows the score
a flash of steel appears against his head
muzzle strobe thup
so long shelly kaplow
the cop looms over bernie and natalie
cocks his pistol
lowers the gun to the back of bernies head
they appear oblivious to it
theyre already in another place
sunning themselves in the bahamas
the cop squeezes back the trigger
still looking at each other
suddenly the piercing shriek of screeching tires
followed by a reverberating bone crunching wham
and a gunshot
bernie and natalie still staring into each others eyes not quite sure whats just transpired
only that theyre still breathing
they look around startled to see the tail lights of a pick up truck about ten yards away
the cop their would be assassin rendered road kill beneath the wheels
all this in the blink of an eye
natalie clutches bernies arm
suppresses a hysterical shock induced giggle
bernie just looks dumbfounded
he staggers to his feet rushes over to the pick up truck
the drivers head is protruding through the shattered windshield
death glazed eyes
bernie feels for the mans pulse just to be sure
shakes his head
we see a dozen coors empties on the seat and floor of the truck
natalie checks the cop
bernie comes over
they regard each other breathlessly
he was drunk
it was just freak luck
dont give it a name bernie
it scares me
all i know is youre still running hot and thats a good thing
but were only winners if we keep going
no looking back
lady luck natalie
im calling it
and we got it as long as were together
they cant touch us now
he kisses her furiously
then drags her over to his car
they climb in
bernies buick racing into the sunrise
racing toward the dream
bernie eyes fixed on the road ahead with the contented smile of a man who has gambled on love and won
his prize resting her head against his shoulder
the money well that aint half bad as well
a smoky trumpet driven chet baker like piece accentuates the triumphant mood on the soundtrack as we superimpose
a little flash forward into the future
larry sits with a group of corporate types
beat i thank you for your vote of confidence
as the shangri las new director of casino operations im gonna make a personal guarantee to each and every one of you
your investment in this casino will be well looked after
the future looks bright gentlemen
very very bright
they raise their glasses to him
congenial smiles one and all
smiles that dont transcend to their eyes
dissolving back into
starting tight on bernie and natalie speeding away from sin city pulling out and rising above them helicopter shot as we superimpose stock footage of all the old school casinos
as we leave vegas in the past
a shangri la lost forever
eulogized by sinatras luck be a lady
