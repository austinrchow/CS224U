have a safe flight home penny
scene switches to fermat and alan playing around in thunderbird like they are really about to fly it into a mission
run pre flight checks
hydraulic systems are green
commence main engine sequence
couldnt hurt to just fire up the instruments
no wait alan
thats the thunderbird begins to start up and fermat shouts wrong switch
there is loud beeping coming from the control panel and the boys cant shut down thunderbird oh could this day get any worse
scene briefly changes to jeff getting an alert in his office
his face appears on a monitor in thunderbird alan my office
thunderbird shuts down it just did
the boys walk out of thunderbird and are walking toward the silo door
fermat is running his hand on the nosecone of thunderbird
i cant believe it

fermats hand touches the goo that mullion fired at thunderbird earlier
look at this
what is it
looks like some sort of gallium electrolyte compound
we gotta get out of here
scene changes to alan walking into his dads office
dad i know youre mad
i shouldnt have been in the ship but if you just give me a minute to explain jeff cuts him off youre damn right you shouldnt have been in there
but nothing happened dad
i had it under control
do you have any idea of the importance of secrecy in our operation
you fired up a thunderbird without activating the anti detection shield
you put everyone in danger when you act selfishly
you want to be part of the team you have to play by the rules
alan just looks at him do you
yeah i understand
i understand you dont want me to be a thunderbird
you dont want me to do anything
you wont even listen to me when im trying to tell you something important
ive heard enough
youre grounded for the rest of spring break
bottom line alan
you need to grow up
then let me
he stalks toward the door before whispering please
jeff is starting at two old family photos on his desk when the video phone rings
i was just about to turn in
what can i do for you
i could sure use a pizza
you know a place that delivers
minutes or its free right
anything else on your mind
well got a forest fire in vladivostok a typhoon heading for singapore
whats happening on planet tracy
alans home for spring break
yeah i thought i could see a storm brewing in your region
well weve all been there
and dad youve done a great job since mom died
keep an eye on that typhoon for us
and uh ill call vladivostok see if they need help with that fire
fermat is down with his father in the thunderbirds hanger
theres something id like to sh sh sh here take a look
the neural net control system
its great to have you back
i bet you didnt think spring break was going to be this w w fun
brains uses the neural net control system to lift up the phone in front of him
it also lifts up the mole which is stationed behind his workplace
and that tiny phone lifts up perfect
the neural net control system short circuits
n n n almost perfect
theres something i want to talk to you about
youre having problems with a g g g chi chi chi wo wo female
alan and i found some sort of gallium compound on the nosecone of thunderbird
we should check that out st st st immediately
thatd be g g g swell
scene skips to alan skipping rocks at the beach
the camera follows one rock and it leads to a telescope coming out of the water
the telescope is connected to the hoods submarine
the island is in sight
transom i need you
sir our cloaking device has evaded their detection systems
we have a positive visual from the tracking solution on thunderbird
sir armed and ready
shall i target the main structure
why would i want to destroy what will soon be mine
one of the principle tenets of eastern martial arts is to use your opponents strength against him
the hood uses his powers to keep mullion in place trying to move and realizing that he cant this is ridiculous
it will be almost impossible to force the thunderbirds to leave their island
on the other hand it requires no effort at all to let them go
the hood stops using his powers on mullion and mullion falls over
the thunderbirds purpose is to rescue
all we need do is give them the victim
the hood looks at transom commence targeting
target acquisition of thunderbird is locked
transom fires a missile at thunderbird
scene switches to john on thunderbird when suddenly alarms start to go off around him
thunderbird to tracy island
missile hits thunderbird and john is blow back into a wall from the explosion
the scene then switches over to tracy island
brains and fermat run into jeffs office
switching to command and control center
brains uses a palm scanner to activate command and control the submarine is briefly showed getting closer to the island
jeff scott virgil and gordon come running into command and control
how bad brains
thunderbird major damage sustained
possible m m m possible strike by m meteor
thunderbirds are go
scene change to inside thunderbird

scene switches to the submarine
there goes the cavalry
but who will rescue the rescuers
scene changes to alan on the beach looking up at thunderbird launching and heading toward thunderbird
tintin runs up beside him and looks up as well
thunderbird has been hit
thunderbird has been hit
thunderbird has been hit
okay okay okay okay okay dont panic
the children look toward the beach when they hear a noise and see the submarine beginning to surface
on the other hand
the kids run and hide behind some trees and shrubs
scene then switches to inside the submarine
we made land
directed toward transom cut them off
activating communications blackout
scene switch to brains in command and control what the he he devil is going on
tracy do you copy
thunderbird please respond
scene switch back to the kids hiding on the beach
howd they find the island
do you think it was what i did in thunderbird
do you think i ruined everything
that compound we found could have some sort of transmitting capability
we have to do something
my dads in the control room but how do we get there now
we have to get a message to my dad
scene switch to thunderbird im losing all power
repeat im losing all power
hold on john
were coming in
gordon prepare for immediate docking

jeff scott virgil and gordon are now in the damaged thunderbird with john
scott tackle that fire
am i glad to see you guys
easy youre hurt
virgil take care of your brother
gordon give me a damage assessment
scene switch to back on the island
the kids are running through the jungle while heading toward the vents and the hood and his crew are heading toward command and control
come on hurry
inside the tracy house transom has found the closed door to command and control center
using an electronic device she finds out what type of door it is
one inch steel plate with sequential titanium locking mechanism
mullion looks and door and pops his joints i love a challenge
scene changes to right outside the tracy house as the kids are approaching the vents
watch out for the guards
get in get in
scene switches to brains sitting nervously in the command and control room whistling nervously to himself and reading a magazine upside down
on the other side of the door there is muffled banging from where mullion is trying to break open the door
door bursts open and mullion transom and the hood walk in who o o o whats going on
so this is mount olympus
and these are the thunderbirds
i should have guessed
jeff tracy the billionaire ex astronaut of course
isnt he the one who lost his wife in an accident
avalanche wasnt it
scene switches to alan tintin and fermat walking in the vents toward the one that leads to the command and control room
whispers just keep going straight ahead
scene switches back to command and control room
we met at last years international conference on nanotechnology
i thought your thesis on neutrinos was extremely stimulating
the command control switch is here
fingerprint recognition system
activate the control switch
n n n n n you must be kidding
professor you and i share an interest in the science of the mind
the difference is i was born with my powers
trust me when i tell you youve barely touched the surface
brains is forced to stand up and walked over to the hood even the strongest minds can be broken
it would be a pity to break yours
fu fu fu no way
activate the control switch prof
uses his powers to make brains move like a puppet on a string
laughs brains hand touches the activation pad
we have control
to brains get up
scene briefly switches to the childrens worried faces in the vents
scene then changes back to thunderbird where the control panel is buzzing
we got a warning light on our eps system
attempt manual override
no thats negative
scene switches back to alan tintin and fermat in the vents
okay this one
scene switches to thunderbird
back to thunderbird now
turns to help an injured john john we gotta move
the locking mechanisms jammed
as you can see i have taken over your facilities
you no longer control your operational systems
scene change back to the kids in the vent
they can stick their heads out of the vent and see into the command and control room but they are hidden behind a panel and the hood and his minions
cannot see them
theyve taken over
warm them up transom
increasing temperature to maximum
the children are now looking into the command and control room
kyrano and his wife onaha are dragged in
whos the bald freak
the hood uses his powers on him and he falls down clutching his head
theyve got m my dad
okay you have our attention
who are you
what do you want
oh how rude of me
you can call me the hood
now listen mr
we wont be negotiating
im going to use the thunderbirds to rob the largest banks in the world starting with the bank of london
the worlds monetary system will be thrown into chaos and the thunderbirds held responsible
youll never get away with it
why the thunderbirds
an eye for an eye mr
an eye for an eye
perhaps youve forgotten me but surely you remember saving the life of my brother kyrano
turns to the video phone that the hood has been using to communicate with thunderbird
im sorry mr
i thought he was dead
laughs and then turns to the guards take them away
the kids lift their heads back up into the vents whoa
that makes the hood my uncle
every family has a black sh sh a black sh sneezes and everyone in the command and control room looks around while brains pretends that it was him that sneezed
turns to look at alan this rooms murder with my allergies
the kids stick their heads back out the vent and look at what is going on in the command and control room
you left me to die that day
you may have broken my body but youve no idea how powerful my mind has become
and now you will suffer as i suffered waiting for a rescue that will never come
makes a motion for transom to cut off the call with thunderbird
video link cuts dead and then the scene cuts to thunderbird
scott status report
co levels are rising
alright wire the oxygen scrubber to the emergency batteries
clean the air
how long will that give us
about four hours
scene switches back to the kids looking into the command and control room
fermat begins to start sneezing again
tintin and alan put their hands over his nose and mouth to try and muffle the sound
mullion walks over to the ceiling he is standing directly below where they are
the kids are trying to leave the vents when his hand shoots up through the ceiling and grabs alans ankle
he lets go after tintin bites his hand and he gasps in pain
the children are now talking loudly and everyone in the command and control room can hear them
we can get through to the silos
the children scream as they fall down a tunnel leading to the silos
and the scene switches to the command and control room
apparently the island is not as secure as you thought
he looks at the old photos that were on jeffs desk
did you find any children
using the security cameras to see into the silos here they are
thunderbird silo in the loading arm
mullion and two other guards run off to get them speaking to transom seal them in
you guys lets go
the children reach the door that leads to thunderbird s silo just as it closes
they run toward the still closing thunderbird silo door
after the door closes before they can get through it no
theyve got us trapped
if we can get to the thunderbird s silo we can escape through the service tunnel
but we need a plan alan
ill use the thunderizer on the door
guards are in the elevator heading down to come get them you guys get the goons with the firefly
this equipment is only to be used in an emergency
alan and tintin give him looks i guess this qualifies
here they come
fermat can you drive this thing
hey watch it
i took microbiology not drivers ed
set the pressure to maximum
the guards walk out of the elevator and see tintin pointing the firefly at them retreat
they fall over and have trouble getting up due to the slipperiness of the stuff fired at them lets move it
time to thunderize
after the door has a hole cut in it
come on lets go
the children are now in thunderbird s silo what were you doing back there fermat
i had an n n idea
just try and keep up okay
ill open the tunnel
we gotta keep moving
alan types in a pass code to tintin and fermat go back
yell when you see them coming
tries another pass code alan turns away from the door for a moment and the camera can see the hood on the other side of the door
alan turns back and sees him
you can run if you want
were you surprised to hear what your father did to me
it is frightening when we realize our parents arent perfect
but perhaps you already suspected that about your father
why did he build these magnificent machines
do you suppose it was guilt
because he let your mother die
alan shakes his head no open the door alan
alan continues to shake his head no the hood chuckles at his refusal open the door
he tries to use his powers on alan but nothing happens shouting to tintin and fermat we cant go this way
the hood uses his powers to open the door and mullion and the other guards appear at the other doorway leaving the children trapped
he falls slightly ow
what are we gonna do alan
i dont know
im thinking okay
alan looks at the control panel behind the hood and sees a button that will open part of the floor under thunderbird
keep backing up
ive got an idea
alan takes his rock launcher from the pouch it is in on the back of his pants
and fires it at the button but misses
thats your idea
its not me youre angry at alan
its not you im aiming at
alan fires another rock and this time hits the button and the floor drops out from underneath tintin fermat and alan
tintin fermat and alan scream as they fall
transom fire up thunderbird
and set it on broil
the kids look behind them while they are falling down the tunnel and see the flames coming from thunderbird behind them
tintin screams even louder
the tunnel opens up and leads to the ocean
back in command and control no sign of them
of course not the little brats went up like firecrackers
pop pop pop
laughs at brains and brains moves to punch him
dont give him the satisfaction professor
this is taking too long
pick out the equipment you need to get into those banks and load it into thunderbird
no more delays
scene switches to the children trying to get onto the beach they are getting knocked over by a couple of waves
fermat is coughing and spluttering
how about a little warning next time you pull a stunt like that
its just a little water
i could have drowned
you mean you cant swim
i repeat i could have drowned
scene switches to the boys ringing out their shirts they are both in their boxers
i said i was sorry fermat
just put this behind us okay
we gotta watch each others backs
no cmon tintin stay there
youre worse than a couple of girls
hurry up and get dressed
to fermat those are nice drawers
scene switches to the children walking along one of the beaches
data from tracy island is sent to thunderbird via satellite right
so theres a miniscule possibility that if we reach the satellite station we could blow it up
no we could hack in to it and give control back to thunderbird
good thinking fermat
alright lets do it
alan starts drawing the plan in the sand heres the plan
were here right
so we go along the shore around the base of the mountain to the access road here
and then up to the transmitter
so what do you think
except that were here not there and the transmitter is there not here
we have to go through the jungle
but thats f f off limits
its gonna be dangerous
all three of them put their hands together we gotta get up there fast
all our folks are in trouble and if the hood gets off the island actually hes not going anywhere for now
the guidance processor for thunderbird
you cant take off without it
fermat youre a genius
howd you get this
alan my friend what you dont know cant hurt you
scene switches to lady penelopes country mansion in england where parker is out cleaning a car when the car phone rings
we have an emergency
scene switch to lady penelopes bathroom what a charming fellow
someone knocks on the door
parker enters lady penelopes bathroom with tea where she is up to her shoulders in bubble bath
have a look at this parker
there is a computer monitor near her feet
he and this woman poor girl both work for this man known as the hood
sounds like an alias milady
quite right parker
real name trangh belagant
assumed dead when his illegal diamond mine collapsed in the jungles of the malaya
takes a sip of tea oh perfect parker
the thunderbirds rescued over mine workers including mr
milady thats mr
tracys loyal manservant kyrano
hows my schedule parker
you have clay pigeon shooting with lord marlborough a benefit gala for the institute of the blind and incidentally theres a typhoon bearing down on singapore
i suppose thats urgent
there was also a bridge collapsed in buenos aires and a volcanic eruption in jakarta
the thunderbirds havent responded
and the media is awash in speculation vis a vis their whereabouts
parker turns on the news
over to lisa lowe
chuck disaster after disaster around the world today and still no sight of the thunderbirds
typhoon jago hit land in singapore just one hour ago and thousands have been left homeless by a volcano in jakarta
only the thunderbirds have the incredible machines i think its time to send the emergency signal parker
i fear youre not wrong milady
back to you chuck
parker hits the top of the tea pot and a light pops out and begins to blink and beep
back on tracy island a similar light begins to flash and bleep but brains is unable to get up to get to it because he is tied up
scene switch to the kids walking through the jungle
im telling you fermat it was like the hood was inside my head back there
what do you mean alan
maybe he can read minds or control minds or something
dont be silly alan
everything can be explained by science
im just trying to figure out his weakness
everybody has an achilles heel right
my achilles heel is actually my achilles heel
its got a blister the size of a basketball
can we s s stop
helping fermat up the hill no more cheeseburgers for you fermat
scene change back to lady penelopes house
you will have to tell lord marlborough that ive broken my shooting arm
we shall send the institute for the blind a dozen guide dogs
and bring the car around
the thunderbirds appear to be in a spot of trouble
and i dont like that
lets go parker
they get in the car and it takes off flying toward tracy island
scene switches to mullion and the hood in the thunderbirds hanger
ready for launch
well use this to get into the vaults
subtle as usual mullion
i didnt realize wed be getting points for style
were robbing banks remember
the hood uses his power on mullion and mullion gasps
youll get your money
looks over toward thunderbird and speaks into headset transom initiate pre flight diagnostics
an alarm suddenly goes off in thunderbird
whats going on
its the guidance processor
whats wrong with it
there isnt one
its the children
they have it
no one could live through something like that
get them mullion
take whatever you need
and make sure you get the guidance processor before you lose your temper
scene switches to the children in the jungle
alan dont you think tintin is blossoming
whats that supposed to mean
come on alan
youve a c crush on her
youve got to be kidding
i mean shes
shes not that bad i guess
reaches the top of the mountain okay guys take five
still finishing climbing up the mountain five isnt going to do it
alan and fermat reach the top of the mountain they are both puffing and panting
tintin smiles at them before she sees a scorpion on alans shoulder
sees scorpion when he stands up next to alan whoa what is it
is that dangerous
milligrams of its venom is fatal
so dangerous is in fact an understatement
tintin uses powers just like her uncle the hood to lift the scorpion off of alans shoulder and lets it fall to the ground
tintin what was that
lets get going
she has the same powers as her uncle the hood
must run in the family
did you do that
just drop it okay
still think everything can be explained by science
scene cuts to thunderbird where there is an alarm and then an explosion near scott and gordon
you all right
the heat exchanger has blown
you dont say
scene switches back to mullion and two other guards searching the jungle for alan tintin and fermat
those brats are in here somewhere
scene change to the kids at the satellite transmitter
how we doing fermat
dont rush me alan
this is very d delicate equipment
the circuit board sparks
which is now b b broken
can you fix it
yea maybe but ill need something to solder with
were in the middle of nowhere fermat where are you going to find something like that
tintin and fermat see alans retainer and share a look what
alan yells as tintin and fermat pull out the metal part of alans retainer
gee alan i never figured you for a crybaby
im gonna kill you
whatd he say
i think it was some sort of apology
i got it yes
y y you the man fermat
okay first step is to establish contact with thunderbird
scene switch to thunderbird dad
alan where are you
are you safe
im at the satellite relay station with fermat and tintin
fermats gonna hack into the main computer system and give control of thunderbird back to you
were standing by
okay were almost there
scene switches to command and control room with transom and brains
goodness me professor
youre so good looking without your glasses on
i think you may find thats another thing we have in common
she leans in to kiss him but an alarm sounds at the control panel oh now thats not fair
just when things were starting to sizzle
to the hood as he walks in a burst of transmission from the islands satellite station
should i jam it
and give mullion the coordinates
scene switches to mullion and the two guards in a car
transom is communicating with him through his headset
take the main track southeast then head up satellite hill
scene switches back to the kids at the satellite station
theyre onto us
were being jammed
can you finish
through the video phone alan whats happening
hang in there dad one more minute okay
its not going to work alan
the signals too weak for data transmission
dad can you hear me
theyre jamming the signal
were going to lose you
dont worry ill take care of everything okay
thats a negative
its too dangerous
follow emergency procedure
wait for lady penelope at the rendezvous point
alan can you read me
the screen begins to break up dad
alan were losing you
alan throws the video phone no
it is now
im sorry alan
this is hard on all of us
no its okay
you dont have to be such a tough guy alan
im worried about my dad too
id do anything to be with my parents right now
but the hood knows were alive now
we have to go
even worse they know exactly tires screech and mullion and the guards appear
