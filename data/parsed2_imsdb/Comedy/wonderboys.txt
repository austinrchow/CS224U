b if window
href b b screenplay steve kloves january pink revision january blue revision december all is a blur
then words appear twisting and vaguely transparent reflected on the window grady tripp stands before as he reads from a sheaf of neatly typed pages
the young girl sat perfectly still in the confessional
grady year old novelist professor and insomniac is in the midst of reading a story to the dozen college students who make up his advanced writing workshop
listening to her fathers boots scrape like chalk on the ancient steps of the church then grow faint then disappear altogether
as he finishes grady ponders a pair of maintenance men perched on ladders in the quad below stringing a large banner between two bare trees
the banner reads grady turns peers at his students
they look as if theyve been on a field trip to the dmv
grady contd a wave of the pages so
a girl with jet black hair turns to a pale young man sitting at a desk in the back of the classroom
he is james leer
like grady a moment before he is staring out the window
let me get this straight
the girl with the big lips is depressed because each night when her father goes off to work at the bakery her mother sneaks some mysterious lover into the house
not only does this girl have to listen to her mother working this guy in the next room she has to wash the sheets each morning before daddy gets home
after a few weeks of this she starts to go a little nutty so daddy takes her to confession only once she gets in the box she gets a whiff
of the priest and realizes hes the mothers secret lover
is that it
james leer says nothing huddling lower in the patty overcoat he wears
i mean jesus
what is it with you catholics
lets try to keep it constructive shall we
howard what about you
i hated it
thats not exactly what i meant by constructive howard
i think james should try to be more constructive
this is my second semester with him
his stories are brutal man
they make me want to kill myself
grady glances at james but his face remains impassive
then with a visible sense of relief grady notices the raised hand of the achingly beautiful hannah green
i think maybe were missing the point
it seems to me james strength as a writer is that he doesnt take us by the hand
he treats us like adults
he respects us enough to forget us
grady nods smiles subtly
well put hannah
and a good note to end on i think
as the students rise dont forget about wordfest this weekend
and remember those of you driving v
s to tonights cocktail party need to have them at the chancellors house no later than
hannah green gathers her things pauses by grady
thanks for that
he all right
i think so
what about you
grady watches her glide away in her cracked red cowboy boots then starts to exit himself
turn out the light please
grady pauses studying the wan figure sitting at the back of the classroom then reluctantly hits the switch on the wail leaving james leer alone in the dark
grady hurries down the steps then spies sara gasksll standing below
she is talking to a boy with an armful of slick programs
calm but firm no elliot i said five hundred programs for today
this means we have no programs for the weekend
this means that tomorrow morning at am several hundred people will walk into thaw hall and have absolutely no idea where they are going
shaking her head its all right elliot
ill take care of it
grady watches sara take the programs turn and spot him
there is the slightest of hesitations then
i got the message you called
i got the message you called too
this hangs in the air awkward somehow then both nod and continue on without so much as a backward glance
the radio blasts as grady pops the glove box removes a joint as big as his pinky and wheels his dark maroon galaxie ragtop away from campus cruising under another
grady cruises past the three rivers and modest skyscrapers of downtown sipping at the weed
grady rides the long automated treadmill that runs half the length of the terminal until
terry crabtree gradys editor and friend exits the tunnel with a stunning young woman in a skin tight black dress bright red topcoat and three inch spike heels
grinning devilishly crabtree whispers something in the womans ear then spots grady
how are you crabtree
say hello to my new friend miss antonia
i took the liberty of inviting antonia to tonights festivities
you dont mind do you
a slight beat the more the merrier
terry was telling me about you on the plane
it was ail so interesting
i was explaining to antonia how a book comes to be published
what you do as a writer what i do as an editor
i sweat blood for five years and he checks for spelling
indicating crabtree thats exactly what he said
we know each other pretty well
to grady so wheres emily
were picking her up
well then shall we
grady nods but lingers briefly studying the architecture of miss sloviaks ankles as she clicks off in her spike heels arm in arm with crabtree
grady and crabtree watch suitcases tumble as miss sloviak sits across the way inspecting her face in a compact
do you know how many times ive boarded an airplane praying someone like her would sit down beside me
particularly while im on my way to pittsburgh
lay off pittsburgh
its one of the great cities
if it can produce a miss sloviak youll get no argument from me
shes a transvestite
shes still a transvestite
crabtree ignores gradys question smiling placidly as he watches the carousel spin
so hows the book
he had been expecting this but not so soon
he tries to act casual
im just sort of
tinkering with it
i was hoping i could get a look at it sometime this weekend
think that might be possible
i dont know
im sort of at a critical
i thought you were tinkering
i just mean
forget i asked
i dont want to pressure you tripp
pointedly i get pressure
know what i mean
grady ponders this troubled by it
suddenly crabtrees face brightens again
what do you suppose that would be
grady turns watches an immense pony hide case drop onto the carousel
that would be a tuba
as the galaxie emerges from a tunnel grady watches the great city of pittsburgh reveal itself in the distance then glances in the rearview mirror
that perfume youre wearing antonia
it wouldnt happen to be cristaile would it
how did you know
you didnt actually purchase this car did you
it was jerry nathans
he owed me money
he owes god money
you know he queered himself for good with esquire
grady takes a joint from the ashtray snaps a scripto butane
he said something about being between things
yeah between a bookie and a pair of broken legs
a young woman with a crumpled pittsburgh steeiers umbrella exits the building and seeing grady parked in front of a fire hydrant stops a puzzled expression on her face
as she approaches grady roils down the passenger window
to the others this is tanya
my wifes secretary
crabtree and miss sloviak smile and nod
tanya smiles and nods back her eyes passing uneasily over gradys joint
emilys not here
grady just smiles nods
tanya contd is there anything i can do for you
grady watches a tiny stream of water trickle through tanyas sad umbrella
youre leaking tanya
tanya nods at a loss then turns away into the rain
she left me
i found a note in the kitchen
why didnt you say something tripp
i mean what are we doing here
grady gazes at the glittering scene beyond his windshield turns on the ignition
i thought maybe i made it all up
through the windows a rabble of writers faculty and select students can be seen mingling under a haze of cigarette smoke
grady brings the galaxie to a lurching halt across the street parks in front of another fire hydrant
as the trio steps out
miss sloviak notices a greenhouse shimmering quietly in the chill night air
thats a nice greenhouse
i thought you were mrs
gaskells hobby tripp
piss off crabs
i lost a wife today
oh im sure youll find another
you always do
as the front door swings open sara gaskell appears riding a wave of jagged party chatter onto the porch
well hello everyone
terry good to see you again
dont you look ravishing
arent you sweet to say so
i was beginning to wonder if you were ever going to oh
as sara steps forward her heel catches and she pitches forward
into gradys arms
its these goddamned shoes
i dont know how anyone actually walks in these things
sara looks at miss sloviak a faint glitter of scientific curiosity in her eye
i dont believe weve met
antonia sloviak just then a thickly mucscled dog with very strange eyes skitters around the corner barking savagely in the general direction of grady
mildly this wouldnt be walters dog would it
poe continues to rage his paws doing crazy eights on the hardwood floor until hes spun himself completely around and is barking at the living room
who s he barking at now
hes still barking at me
now stop this
as poe simmers to a deep growl grady leans forward
i need to talk to you
i need to talk to you too
strategy in her tone perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room professor tripp
reading her i dont believe i know where the upstairs guest room is
id better show you
terry well just make ourselves at home
kneeling by poe wont we poe
grady enters a room swimming in basebail memorabilia
autographed baseballs abound as well as photographs of famous big leaguers
in one somewhat dated photo a trim man in his forties a younger walter gaskell stands with pittsburgh pirate bill mazeroski at an old timers game
as sara eases the door shut grady nods to a yankees pennant hanging over the mantle
nodding walter just got it back from the framer today
sara takes gradys hand drawing him away from the pennant and down onto the coat covered bed
you go first
this morning im pregnant
a flash of laughter flutters from the living room below
grady starts to speak
i think walter would find this a little more than surprising
grady nods getting her drift then roils onto his back
emily left me this morning
shes left before
shes left the room before
she always came back
i guess we just divorce our spouses marry each other and have this baby right
grady and sara stare at the ceiling
sara sniffs the coat lying beneath her
miss sloviaks coat
is that cristaile
weary my god i wear the same scent as a transvestite
she is a transvestite isnt she
if shes not now terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening
has he asked to see the book yet
are you going to tell him
i dont know
i dont know what im going to do
distantly neither do
grady starts to pull up but his arm is underneath sara
sara my arm
im stuck honey
i guess youre going to have to chew it off then
poe noses blindly through a forest of legs pauses by miss sloviaks high heels and scores a rye krisp
crabtree returning with a pair of drinks tiptoes around him finds miss sloviak chatting with a trim man in his s
i see youve met my friend
she s charming
taking her drink walters been telling me the most fascinating things about marilyn monroe and
who was it
simply put antonia it s my contention that their marriage tapped into the very id of american popular culture
joe dimaggio represented metaphorically speaking the husband as slugger
and though it may be controversial i personally believe every woman in some way desires to be marilyn monroe
oh i couldnt agree more
grady works his way through the crowd spies walter and changes course
directly ahead is an oddly commanding man q
from the behavior of the people in his vicinity its clear he is someone of interest
presently he is putting the make on hannah green
and while my latest has been on the new york times bestseller list for weeks i cant help but lament that my first book which contains what i consider my
finest writing was remaindered in less than five
so i find myself conflicted
ask him if hes conflicted about his house in the hamptons
q eyes grady over his wine glass
hannahs had two stories published in the paris review
youd best dust off the a material for her
as grady moves off he sees poe sniffing and goes the other way heading directly into the crosshairs of a mah in tweed who is talking to another shorter man
to short man a supermarket for the mind my ass
im telling you theyre nothing but a big fat mob laundry
have you ever been to davenport iowa
let me tell you they need a square foot bookstore like they need another goddamn cow
as grady passes grady
my god i havent seen you since what
the pen faulkner awards
that was a big night for you grady
to his friend grady was there for arsonists daughter the short man blinks impulsively takes gradys hand
douglas triddly amherst
i kid you not when i say arsonists daughter belongs in the pantheon of late twentieth century fiction
ive had it on my graduate studies syllabus three years running
pulling away no wonder its still in print
as grady flees he passes a woman holding a cigarette
can take my word for it writers are lousy fucks
poets arent bad but then youve got to deal with the sweater thing
theyll discover the cancer in your heart every time but god forbid they find a decent dry cleaner
grady comes out the back door and ferrets a joint from his pocket lights it
he takes a long draw walks around the side of the house
as he passes a window a voice accosts him
there you are
grady starts but when he looks through the window he sees that the voice belongs to walter gaskell and the person to whom hes talking is sara
they are standing in the kitchen near an elaborate wine rack
i could swear i had a chateau latour in here
you havent seen it have you
i doubt id recognize a chateau latour if i was sitting on it
youd recognize it if you tasted it
i doubt it darling
angling bottle to the light well q certainly will
and given that he will be addressing people in little over an hour
you want to keep him happy
if he s happy
kissing her as he exits im happy
as walter goes grady studies sara as she stands alone in the quiet little room looking small and tired
finally she takes a breath steeling herself and moves off returning to the clamor inside her house
grady sighs guilt stricken then detects a flicker of light coming from the darkness beyond
a figure is watching him from the retaining wail that leads to the gaskells garage
grady blinks chagrined that hes been caught eavesdropping then his eyes narrow and he steps off the porch
james leer wears the same nasty overcoat from class a green knapsack hanging off one shoulder
grady looks at what appears to be a sliver of moonlight in james palm
james face betrays his own fragile chagrin and grady peers more closely at what lies in his extended hand
the sliver of moonlight is in fact a shiny pearl handled it was my mothers
she won it in a penny arcade in baltimore when she was in catholic school
its very convincing
it used to shoot these little paper caps but they dont make them anymore
grady reaches for the gun but james closes his fingers and slips the tiny thing back into his overcoat
for good luck
some people carry rabbits feet
you carry firearms
as grady exhales a plume of smoke james eyes pass briefly over the jay
grady notices offers
no thank you
i dont like to lose control of my emotions
grady nods accustomed to james weirdness
im not supposed to be here in case you were wondering
i mean not intentionally
james nods toward the house where hannah green can be seen in a window still fending off the determined q
james leer contd but the other night hannah and i were together at the movies and she asked me
since she was coming
so i ended up coming
grady nods ponders this over elaborate explanation
are you and hannah seeing each other james
what gave you that idea
im not her father
i just rent her a room
she likes old movies like i do thats ail
glancing back at the window besides she doesnt really know me
she thinks she does but she doesnt
maybe its because shes mormon and im catholic
maybe its because shes beautiful and she knows it and try as she might to not let that screw her up its inevitable that it will in some way
james looks away from the window at grady
youre not like my other teachers professor tripp
youre not like my other students james
so what was the movie you two saw
son or fury
with tyrone power and frances farmer
she went crazy frances farmer
so did gene tierney
shes in it too
sounds like a good one
a crooked smile its not bad
grady considers james fragile face
listen james about this afternoon
i think i let things get a bit out of control
they really hated it
i think they hated it more than any of the other ones
it doesnt matter
it only took me an hour to write
truly impressed really
i have trouble sleeping
while im lying in bed i figure them out
as james gazes off at the gloaming greenhouse grady looks down at the left front pocket of james overcoat
like a nervous tic james hand hidden twitches against the modest bulk of the cap gun
you cold james
distant a little
so what are you doing out here
its colder in there
laughing youre right
james blinks startled by gradys laughter startled that hes said something funny
he looks back to the greenhouse actually i saw the greenhouse
so i thought i thought id come out here and take a look at it
you dont see one of those every day
it looks like heaven
i saw a movie once
part of it took place in heaven
everyone wore white and lived in crystal houses
at least thats the way i remember it
abruptly james glances at his watch
i should be going
james turns away then stops
he stands like this a moment then turns back
holds out his right hand
james leer contd goodbye professor tripp
grady hesitates then shakes james hand
james moves off then leaving the light of the house behind
as he stops dont leave just yet
theres something i think you ought to see
ill miss my bus
this is worth it
james looks conflicted
grady contd trust me
its quieter now the party winding down as grady sneaks james past the departing guests and toward the stairs
hey you two
grady stops sees hannah slipping on a coat in the foyer
hannah green contd are you riding with me james
no im going ho hes going with me
you take crabtree
and his friend
by the way his friend
the answers yes
i dont know
where are they exactly
here we are
crabtree appears at the top of the landing with miss sloviak
her lipstick is blurry
spying james nell hello there
crabtree steps down the stairs hand extended
james leers pale fingers rise as if on a string
this is my editor terry crabtree
jamesll know about george sanders
crabtree was saying how george sanders killed himself only he couldnt remember how
in a costa brava hotel room
the few people within earshot glance oddly at james but crabtrees eyes glitter with intrigue
how comprehensive of you
oh james is amazing
he knows all the movie suicides
go ahead james
tell them who else
theres so many
just a few then
the big ones
james glances at the loose group of people around him watching then
pier angeli or also pills
charles boyer pills again
charles butterworth i think
in a car
supposedly it was an accident but you know
a trace of irony he was distraught
dorothy dandridge she took pills in like
albert dekker he hung himself
he wrote his suicide note in lipstick on his stomach
alan ladd more pills carole landis pills again i forget when
george reeves superman on tv shot himself
jean seberg pills of course
everett sioane he was good pills
margaret sullavan pills lupe velez a lot of pills
he shot himself and his wife in
there are more but i dont know if you would have heard of them
i havent heard of half of those
you did them alphabetically
james turns finds crabtrees laser eyes on him
james blinks as if he had forgotten about crabtree then shrugs shyly looks away
thats just how my brain works i guess
listen why dont you come out with us after the lecture
theres a place on the hill i always get trip to take me
i just want to go home
oh dont be silly
no one your age just wants to go home
besides faculty will be present
just think of it as a field trip
as he exits crabtree raises an eyebrow to grady as if to say bring him
miss sloviak follows eyeing james glacially as we cut to the dull purr of a combination lock is heard a door opens and a triangle of light falls on a
photograph of marilyn monroes joe dimaggio on their wedding day
grady and james leer stand in the doorway
just below the photograph of marilyn and joe hanging next to a pin striped jersey bearing the number is a short black satin jacket trimmed with an ermine collar
is that really it
thats really it
the one she wore on her wedding day
so im told
james in the presence of the holy grail of suicide garments stands speechless
contd go ahead
james swallows then goes to the jacket
carefully he reaches out his fingers and touches the yellowed collar barely making contact as though it might crumble to dust
like the lady herself
grady says this airily ironically riding his buzz a bit but james nods solemnly eyes transfixed on the jacket as if marilyn herself were inside it
she was small
most people dont know that
the shoulders are small
touching the satin it looks so perfect
i bet its the only time she wore it
she mustve felt so happy
grady studies james as he takes the fringe of the jacket lifts it lightly
its feels unreal like butterfly wings or
it mustve cost dr
gaskell a lot
walter never tells sara the truth about how much he pays for these things
youre really good friends with the chancellor arent you
gradys eyes slide paranoid but james face remains unchanged consumed with the jacket
carefully pretty good
im friends with dr
i guess you must be if you know the combination to his closet and he doesnt mind your being here in their bedroom like this
a door slams downstairs and grady and james jump
the click of a womans high heels sends grady to the bedroom window where he watches sara slide into a white citroen ds turn on the ignition and motor away
we better skedaddle
close that closet james
you ail right
james is slumped on the gaskells white linen bed knapsack between his knees head in hands
maybe its seeing that jacket that belonged to her
it just looks
in a closet
maybe im just a little sad
im feeling a little sad myself tonight
you mean with your wife leaving you and ail
off gradys look hannah mentioned something about it
about a note
its complicated james
i think we should go now
without thinking grady flicks out the bedroom light leaving james leer in the dark for the second time today
james just sits there a shadow in a room of shadows
a low rumble freezes grady as he enters the hail
a few feet away poe lies belly to the ground his blind blue eyes trained more or less in gradys direction
grady starts to take a step when
poe shoots forward and sinks himself deep into gradys ankle
grady hops gracelessly momentarily lifting poe off the ground as he swings his leg up
poe countering rolls his head in a snapping motion and drops grady in a clumsy heap
get off of me you son of a bitch
poe regains his feet but doesnt let go whipping his head back and forth back and forth over and over growling low dark and hideously from the back of his
throat until there is a sharp
poe yelps goes perfectly still then topples heavily onto gradys legs
james leer stands in the doorway posed with the little pearl handled pistol like steve mcqueen
grady looks at james
then back to james
you shoe dr
i had to
couldnt youve just pulled him off me
he was crazy
i didnt he looked thought okay okay
take it easy
dont freak out on me
grady roils down his sock
apparently poe went through life with a slight overbite
do you have a mirror
its the best way to see if someones breathing
hes dead james
believe me i know a dead dog when i see one
james looks miserably at poe
what are we going to do
grady rises awkwardly holds out his hand
first youre going to give me that little cap gun of yours
grady and james stare gloomily out the windshield
can i ask you a question
what are we going to do with
james glances in the backseat where poe lies strange blue eyes gleaming
i dont know
im still trying to figure out how to tell the chancellor i murdered her husbands dog
trust me james when the family pets been assassinated the owner doesnt want to hear one of her students was the triggerman
does she want to hear it was one of her professors
ive got tenure
as sporadic applause wafts from the high windowpanes of thaw hall grady leans into the galaxies trunk creates a space between the tuba and a zippered suitcase
james totters forward arms hooked under poes front legs looking like a sorry marathon dancer
grady frowns limps forward and takes the hind legs
hes still a little warm
they lay him down push him deep into the trunk until there is a sound like a pencil snapping
grady grabs crabtrees garment bag frisks the pockets
it fits a tuba a suitcase a dead dog and a garment bag almost perfectly
searching thats just what they used to say in the ads
come on crabtree i know youre holding
whose tuba is that anyway
can i ask you something about her
here we go
grady unravels a pair of boxer shorts finds an airplane size bottle of jack daniels then grabs another pair of boxers
is is your friend crabtree is he gay
most of the time he is james
some of the time he isnt
now what do we have here
grady rattles a prescription bottle then shakes out a pair of white pills each etched with a tiny numeral
our old friend mr
that should take the pinch out of my ankle
handing the bottle to james have one
im fine without them
thats why you were standing in the chancellors back yard twirling that little cap gun of yours tonight
youre fine all right youre fit as a fucking fiddle
grady opens the tiny bottle of jack with his teeth drinks down two number s then looks at james
im sorry james
im sorry i said that
recklessly james takes a pill tosses it in his mouth and tips back the tiny bottle of jack
half a second later he spits it all out
grady looks down peels the soggy pill from the lapel of his jacket
how bout we try that again
on the stage
walter gaskell stands alone at a podium
really needs no introduction
walk down the aisle of any airplane or by the pool of any hotel and youll see his face beaming back at you
you all know the name you all know the books so welcome if you will the man those of us who know him simply call
as the audience thunders grady and james slink into the auditorium
its standing room only
as they head for an open space against the back wail grady squeezes past a kid with a goatee
who regards him warily
grady stares over the gleaming sea of heads before him watching as q pauses
for a very long moment
waiting until the auditorium is consumed in a heavy anticipatory hush
finally he speaks again
i am a writer
as the audience explodes with glee grady frowns
he glances to his right sees james left brow crinkled with a similar look of bafflement
q contd as a writer one thing you learn is that everyone you encounter has a story
every bartender every taxi driver everybody has an idea or a
story that would make a great book or a great movie
presumably each of you has an idea
gestures to the audience but how do you go from there to here
how do you go from having an idea to having a book
how do you get across
what is the bridge the bridge that allows you to walk on air from the shoreline of inspiration to the terra firma of accomplishment
faith that your story is worth the telling faith that you have the wherewithal to tell it faith that the carefully woven structure you create wont collapse beneath you
grady glances at james sees that his eyes are unblinking and glazed then sees beyond him sara standing by the far exit
a blink later she is gone
q contd and faith that when you get to the other side someone will be waiting who gives a damn about the tale you have to tell
grady leans back listening to the beating of his own heart the soft glimmer of the chandeliers hanging by a thread forty feet above his head
abruptly james laughs out loud some private amusement bubbling up from the bottom or his brain and out into the auditorium
as q looks and four hundred other heads turn james ducks down mortified
crabtree sitting a few rows away studies james with amusement then winks at grady
grady blinks turns to james
ill be right back
grady bursts through the auditorium doors and into the lobby
of local booksellers chatting quietly behind a table arrayed with the books of attending authors glance up as grady limps toward the restrooms
grady stumbles down the sloping carper but the corridor begins to turn sideways on him and he stops resting his cheek against the cool
grady opens his eyes finds saras face swimming above him
he is lying on his back in the corridor his corduroy blazer bundled under his head like a pillow
you had another one didnt you
you have to see a doctor grady
first thing monday morning
is the thing is it over
wane to sit up
as he winces whats the matter
i think i twisted my grady looks at his ankle and feels a rush of guilt
i have to tell you something
saras face stiffens becomes more chancelloresque
then stand up
im too old for all this roiling around on the floor
grady lets her pull him up watches her light a cigarette
i know what youre going to say
no really sara i dont think you you love emily
i know that
and you need to stay with her
i dont think i really have a choice in that
emily left me
shell come back
thats why im going to
to not have this baby
grady watches her flip her hand up bring the cigarette to her lips and inhale
then grimace and drop it to the floor
not have it
theres no way
i mean dont you think theres no way
well no i dont see any way
taking her hand and i know how hard it is for you to to lose this chance
jerking away no you dont
and fuck you for saying you do
and fuck you for saying
quietly for saying theres just no way
because there could be a way grady
somewhere deep in the building applause swells
composing herself he must be finishing
we should go
grady looks sadly at sara then stoops to retrieve his coat
as he grabs it james leers little pistol clatters to the floor
whos gun is that
its its a souvenir
before grady can close his hand sara has it in her own
smells like gunpowder
she points it at gradys chest
he smiles nervously
you got me
i love you grady
grady places his fingers gently over saras
and removes the gun from her hand
i love you too
the auditorium doors swing open and james leer emerges arms draped over crabtree and a large student
the doors made so much noise
as they make for the restrooms sara and grady appear
this is so embarrassing
you guys had to carry me out
is he ail right
rolling his eyes hes fine
were going to the mens room
only we might not make it in time
terry crabtree and james leer
leave it to you to make that mistake wait here
as sara heads off after james grady turns toward the lobby
directly into the hostile gaze of miss sloviak
i need a ride
im your man
as the galaxies big trunk yawns open
miss sloviak stares at whats wedged up against her suitcase
theres an explanation
miss sloviak raises an eyebrow and then leaning in unzips her suitcase
as grady drives miss sloviak finishes with the top button of a mans shirt then reaches into the zippered cosmetics bag in her lap
onto the open tray of the glovebox she places a jar of cold cream a bottle of nail polish remover and a cloud of cotton balls
couldnt he have just thrown a shoe at the poor thing
i dont know
and when your friend crabtree gets done with him hes going to be even more disturbed
im not sure thats possible
sure it is
grady watches miss sloviak peel the wig from her forehead
listen antonia tony
now that im home
im sorry if things didnt work out so well for you tonight
i shouldve known better
your friend is just i dont know into collecting weird tricks
tony angles the rearview mirror toward himself
hes writing his name in water
like most editors he really wants to be a writer but hes too busy living a novel to bother writing one
that sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit
hed call it habit
i get the feeling hes going through the motions a bit
tony peels off a pair of false eyelashes blinks
you mean because his careers ruined and all
is that what he told you
he said he hasnt had a success in ten years and everyone in new york thinks hes kind of a
as tony re sets the rearview mirror grady gets a glimpse of his own swollen eyes
but im sure your book is so good that hell be able to keep his job
hearing this grady looks troubled
miss sloviak points
contd turn here
grady pulls in front of a small brick house
on the front lawn a small statue of the blessed virgin stands under a little white band shell painted with stars
that s nice
all we have is a japanese beetle trap
its a bathtub
what shes standing under
the porch light conies on and a small white haired man squints through the screen door
turning let me see it
grady reaches into his pocket hands it over
its like the kind of gun bette davis would carry
in a little beaded purse
grady studies the gun in tonys hand then glances at the front screen door
pop is still there
id better go
i think i may have to rescue james leer
miss sloviak returns the gun
steps out of the car and peers in at grady
you know grady if i were you
id think about going home
you look like you need a little rescuing yourself
grady parks near a van that has kravniks sporting goods stenciled on the side
he watches a bouncer frisk a patron in the pink light of the hi hat clubs entrance then slides james leers little pistol into the glovebox
as grady steps to the door the bouncer gives him a perfunctory pat down
kidding him clean tonight hub professor
as a whistle
hannah green is dancing with a sweat drenched q as grady enters this smoke filled rhythm and blues club
she beckons with a finger but grady nervous at the sight of her glistening mormon skin merely pantomimes an exaggerated shrug and she points
crabtree and james leer sit at a dark corner table
james slouches eyes half closed while crabtree stares in the general vicinity of the dancers his hand extended beneath the table in the general vicinity of james lap
grady looking a little alarmed grabs a passing double dickel on the rocks
as grady arrives crabtree withdraws his hand delicately and james eyes flutter open
is that just beer
although i gather you two staged a little raid on the crabtree pharmacopoeia
you missed a few bottles by the way
where is everyone
sara and walter declined
guess they wanted to go home and curl up on the couch with the dog
grady cuts james a glance trying to determine if hes copped on poe but james is winking out
his head drifts back against the wail settles with a gentle
crabtree glances over nods
he has a book
he started it fall semester
he finished it winter break
grady looks up unable to disguise his surprise
he glances at james slack face tilted against the wall
is he any good
not yet he isnt
well im going to read it anyway
dont do this
one o my students for christ sake
im not even sure if hes he is
take my word for it
i think its more complicated than that
besides hes a little
he almost did something stupid tonight
at least i think so
anyway he doesnt need sexual confusion thrown into the stew right now
on the contrary it could be just the ticket
ducking in double dickel
grady notices the waitresss nametag oola and realizes she is conspicuously pregnant
he watches her disappear beyond the blur of bodies on the dancefloor where hannah greens slinky form seizes his attention
no sexual confusion there eh professor
shut up and drink
crabtree grins brings his bottle up then stops
oh my goodness
do you see what i see
grady follows crabtrees glance and finds oola again but its not oola crabtree is eyeing its her customer
president of the james brown hair club for men
sitting alone in the dark booth is a small black man with big hands a face peppered with scar tissue and most noticeably a tsunami of hair sprouting from his
initiating an old game hes a boxer
his names um curtis
the scars are from a from a horse
he fell during a race and got trampled
and now hes addicted to painkillers
he cant piss standing up anymore
he lives with his mother
and he had a younger brother who
and his mother blames vernon for his death
sleepily he was killed when a gangster named freddie nostrils tried to shoot his favorite horse
he took the bullet himself
grady and crabtree turn to look at james leer who opens one bloodshot eye to regard them
vernon over there was in on the hit
james eye closes
crabtree looks over at grady
that was good
he heard everything we were saying
just then hannah green bounces up in her red boots
i want you to dance with me
grady and hannah reflected in bits and pieces in the jack o lantern wail of mirrored tile slow dance to a sexy measured blues
ive been re reading arsonists daughter
its so beautiful grady
its like ail your sentences always existed just waiting around in style heaven or wherever for you to fetch them down
i thank you
and i love the inscription you wrote to me
only im not quite the downy innocent you think i am
i hope that isnt true
we need all the downy innocents we can get
grady spies the corner table watches crabtree say something to q and then casually stroke a lock of hair from james leers forehead
so what are you going to do
i just mean i i guess emily isnt going to be there when you get home
grady looks down into hannahs translucent face then catches a glimpse of himself in the fractured wail
the tile that would reflect his head is missing
are you holding me up or am i dragging you down
hannah snuggles closer lays her head on gradys chest
grady limping on his bad ankle carries james to hannahs rumpled renault props him against the fender
when you get him home
make sure hes ail right
before you leave
i would if i knew where i was taking him
hannah are you telling me you dont know where james leer lives
some apartment somewhere
but ive never seen it
that strikes me as odd
james is odd
i know he has an aunt in sewickley heights
i dropped him there once but
remembering come to think of it it wasnt even his aunts house
he said she worked there
i dont remember
james mumbles starts to slide onto the hood of the car
whats he saying
you know that ratty green thing hes always carrying around
he mustve left it inside
last time i saw it was
grady glances at the idling galaxie across the street
and q huddle inside
he mustve left it back at thaw
in the auditorium
delirious but insistent mmrrmmm
grady frowns in annoyance opens the passenger door
grady contd all right
take him to my place
he can crash on the sofa
the one in your office
its the best one
i dont think it really matters hannah
we could probably stand him up in the garage with the snow shovels at this point
as grady lowers james into the seat he whimpers curls into a bail
hannah turns her puppy dog eyes on grady
in my office
as grady starts to turn away hannahs fingers graze his face
if you want to talk later
ill be up
grady watches her fold her lovely self into the car and drive away
he sighs crosses to the galaxie and just has his hand on the doorhandle when a tiny figure appears
you driving this car
this maroon ford galaxie
you driving this car
its mine motherfucker
you must be mistaken
grady shakes his head wearily opens the door
go home to your mother vernon
grady slides in next to q puts the car in gear and starts to pull away
as he glances in the rearview he sees crabtree smiling darkly in the backseat
all right whats the matter
crabtree just keeps smiling
christ crabs what do you expect me to do
the kids practically in a coma
hit your brakes
grady flicks his eyes from the rearview mirror just as a shadow looms in his headlights
as he squashes the break pedal qs eyeglasses go flying into the windshield
squinting oh my god
what is that
its vernon waving his arms his shadow enormous in the beams of light
whats this guys problem
just go around him
grady taps the accelerator but each time vernon dances back in front of gradys grille
go out the other way
grady throws the car in reverse backs straight up then turns up a one way street
he shoots down the alley behind the hi hat turns onto the adjoining street
and watches in amazement as vernon materializes from behind the high wooden fence that runs parallel to the galaxie
as grady pinches the brakes vernon grins
mischievously you could always go over him
then as the three men watch vernon rocks back on his heels and with a gymnasts precision pitches himself onto the galaxies big hood
he lands on his ass slides smoothly off then takes a deep bow and disappears into the night
what just happened
grady peers at the wrinkled asterisk on his hood
i just had my car jumped on
grady stops the car in the red zone and gets out
ill be right back
where would we go
the janitor the same shaggy haired kid grady saw rigging the wordfest banner earlier is struggling with a balky floor waxer as grady steps up to the double doors and
slaps his hand against the glass
grady pushes on the door and it opens
janitor contd hey professor tripp
off gradys look traxler
i took your class freshman year
then i dropped out of school
i hope it wasnt my fault
taking him seriously no
i guess youre here for the backpack
the knapsack is sitting on one of the metal folding chairs as sam and gradyenter the silent hail
i saw the manuscript inside
so when you showed up i figured
grady lifts the knapsack peers inside
there is no title page to the manuscript just the words the love parade and then halfway down text
is it good
reading i dont know
it might be
grady steps outside closes the flap of the knapsack and hunching his shoulders against the cold
traxler gives grady a ride in his honda one of the original hondas best suited for sidewalk driving
the backseat bulges with a huge amplifier and bass guitar
say professor tripp is ail that stuff true about errol flynn
how he used to put coke on his dick
to make himself you know like last longer
how the hell should i know
well jeez youre reading his biography arent you
sam points and grady glances at the knapsack riding on the seat between him and sam
a book bearing errol flynns picture is tucked into the side pouch
yeah thats true
he used to rub ail kinds of things on it
sam brings the car to a coughing idle across the street from the gaskells house
wow check out that greenhouse
is that your wife
grady gazes at sara a
vaporous blur in the greenhouse
no my wifes out of town
just then the honda fills with light
headlights loom then a police car sweeps into the gaskells driveway
walter appears on the front steps
traxler contd whos that guy
traxler looks anxiously at the police car
what exactly are we doing here professor tripp
staring at sara taking the long way home
as traxler drives away grady mounts the porch with james leers knapsack hanging from one shoulder
he reaches above the door feeling for a key but his fingers come away with only dust
he stands dispirited then an idea strikes
he takes the doorknob turns it
grady enters closes the door quietly behind him
the room is dim but the tv is on throwing crazy slashes of light onto the wails and ceiling
as grady limps by he finds a sleeping hannah green bundled in a blanket t shirt and little else
on the floor near her dangling hand woolfs a common reader lays open next to a diet coke
grady considers the smooth geography of her body but his eyes are most powerfully drawn to
he steps forward lifts the blanket gently but finds to his disappointment only the red cowboy boots
he picks up the remote turns off the tv and exits
james leer slumbers on a green sofa draped in an old sleeping bag
grady drops behind his desk lets james knapsack slide to the floor
he lifts his cuff inspects his ugly ankle then glimpses something in the knapsack
grady reaches down and slowly like a magician producing a magical scarf extracts marilyn monroes wedding jacket from james leers ratty green knapsack
grady glances at the young man on his sofa then looking very tired reaches for the desk lamp
and turns out the light on the both of them
grady steps outside in a womans chenille bathrobe and plucks the pittsburgh post gazette from the second porch step
he fishes out a charred roach starts to light it then notices the galaxie sitting in the driveway
as crabtree snores thunderously grady eases open the door spots the car keys on the dresser grabs them
grady eases the door shut starts to turn then stops his eyes drawn to the door just across the landing from crabtrees room
grady pushes open the door with the tips of his fingers lets it glide open
the room that is revealed is bright and well ordered in direct contrast to the lazy clutter of gradys office
there is a drafting table and a computer pads and pens neatly arranged alongside
a bulliten board hangs on one wall bearing an intricate mosaic of multi colored index cards
there are prints framed from various art exhibits and two of gradys dhstjackets including most prominently arsonists daughter
there are photographs of emily too
in a black turtleneck with friends
in a sundress with grady
in a billowing burberry floating like a dark butterfly against a blur of yellow taxis on a street in manhattan
grady enters with a thermos pauses redistributes the sleeping bag over james leers pale body
without waking thank you
grady sits at his desk pours himself a cup of coffee from the thermos then sets the cup directly in the center of a galaxy of previous coffee rings
next he takes a clean piece of paper balls it up and with ritual precision strokes it into the miniature basketball hoop that crowns the rim of the waste basket
across the room
a volt crowd roar belches from the hoop and without further ceremony grady turns to the blank page curling from his ibm selectric and spaces to the top right corner
types beat in other words page
close up the typewriter paper darkening with words the keys snapping faster and faster a crazy clamor that grows and grows until finally it just
james i grady awakes with his back to the floor james leers quizzical face floating like a cloud above him
i just lost my balance
i put you on the floor
i thought you might l dont know swallow your tongue or something
nodding to gradys robe i guess you really miss her huh
grady peers down at the geraniums blooming on the pockets of the robe its overall fuzziness
this isnt emilys
i just write in it
i guess theres probably a story behind that
there is but its not that interesting
down the hallway in another room the want me to get that
as james shuffles away in the sleeping bag grady rises delicately and turns toward the window
just in time to see a police car roil slowly by on the screen below
returning he didnt give his name
the guy on the phone
whatd he say
he wanted to know if a grady trip
lived here and drove a dark maroon ford galaxie with black interior
whatd you tell him
if the zodiac killer calls be sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the right
i thought maybe youd won a radio contest or something
is that single spaced
james has noticed the towering stack of ib
bond on gradys desk
thats a big book youre writing
i think its sort of writing itself at this point
wow hannah always swore you were working but but
nothing its just that well its been awhile since arsonists daughter and some people some of the kids in workshop thought maybe you were
i dont believe in writers block
james takes another glance at the mammoth manuscript
a loud hacking is heard
grady and james turn watch crabtree wearing only a pair of striped boxers materialize in the hallway
good morning boys
james waves feebly from beneath the sleeping bag
re james attire if you re planning on staying for breakfast id put on something a little less comfortable if i were you
as grady moves to his desk to reacquaint himself with the page curling from the typewriter james continues to stare into the emptiness of the hallway
the sight of crabtree seems to have made him suddenly queasy
how did i get here last night
no one seems to know where you live james
hannah thought youd like my couch
and before that
did i do anything
well james you did shoot the head of the english departments dog and steal his most prized piece of memorabilia
as james contemplates this the doorbell rings
grady looks up sees the police car he noticed earlier now parked at the bottom of his driveway
do yourself a favor james
a policeman not much older than james leer waits
as the door opens grady appears
eyeing gradys robe professor tripp
sorry to bother you sir but i understand you attended an event at sara and walter gaskells house last night and were one of the last to leave
james lurks at the top of the stairs swaddled in the sleeping bag straining to hear
was just wondering if maybe you saw anyone
someone you didnt know
who seemed out of place
grady is scratching his head in mock thought
well theres always people you dont know at these things but i cant say there was anybody particularly suspicious
there was one guy
claimed to be a jockey
you mean like horses right
hardpple pupcik stops on his pad looks up
i could be wrong
what happened anyway
oh someone pulled a b e on dr
and the dogs missing
we figure the perpetrator let him out
hes blind and we figure he just wandered off and got run over
no the dog
pupcik nods slowly as if re filing grady under dealing with assholes
one other thing
about this kid this student of yours leer james leer
you wouldnt know how i could get in touch with him would you
i might have his number on campus
thats all right
well find him
pete pupcik smiles tips his big blue police hat and turns away
grady frowns starts to close the door
there you are
grady stiffens then turns to find hannah green across the room in her t shirt and cowboy boots looking ail dewy eyed and delectable
i thought we were going to talk
hannah stretches and the t shirt slides dangerously up her thighs
im here when you want me
grady stands frozen as hannah smiles sleepily pushes through the swinging door into the kitchen
a thumping is heard as james tangled in the sleeping bag hitches down the last few steps of the stairway
he watches pete pupcik drive away in his big police car
what do we do now
before grady can reply
the telephone sitting on the table next to him hello
grady its sara
thank god youre there
you wont believe whats happened
could you hold on a minute honey
with a look of wonderment grady watches his hand ever so gently
hang up the phone
how bout we get the hell out of here
james now wearing one of gradys flannel shirts beneath his ratty overcoat follows grady to the galaxie knapsack swinging from his shoulder
grady tosses him a ring of you start her up
as grady runs a plastic wedge over the glaze of ice blanketing the windshield james stares curiously at the keys as if they were some strange artifact then slides behind
the steering wheel
as the engine roars hows that
well done james
as grady works james face comes into view then
the wedge snaps splintering into the flesh of gradys hand
grady contd shit
james blinks pokes his head out the window
grady and james stand in the sundries aisle of a neighborhood market
grady has a tin of band aids open and is presently plastering his ragged thumb
where exactly do you live james
james in the midst of chugging from a ounce jug of orange juice stops
apparently not even hannah green has a clue as to the location of your apartment
grady tosses the tin of band aids into a small plastic hand basket begins to move down the aisle
i got kicked out
well not exactly kicked out
i was asked to leave
i guess theres probably a story behind that
there is but its not that interesting
so where have you been staying
a long pause the bus station
grady stares incredulously at james
its not so bad
i know the night janitor
and theres a broken locker i can put my stuff
trying to fathom this but james
a couple weeks
thats why i had the gun
jesus james you shouldve told someone
i dont know
grady drops the basket at the check out counter and abruptly finds himself face to face with a baby lolling on the shoulder of the woman before him
the baby is staring spellbound at a display of
qs latest frowns then detects the true source of enchantment a spray of shiny mylar gift balloons
a thought evolves
grady contd the balloons what do you think of these
james takes another chug from his jug nods
grady squinting through the ten inch panel of cleared ice on the windshield roils slowly up onto the curb in front of walter and sara gaskells house
grady pops the glovebox takes out a pen and scratches something on the gift card attached to the balloon
james glances briefly at a plump ziploc of pot stashed in the glovebox then peers at the house
the house isnt this
grady gets out then pauses glancing at the giant orange juice jug between james legs
its about half down
you better ease off that stuff james
its pretty acidic
james takes a powdered donut that lies on his coat studies it curiously
i cant help myself
i dont know whats the matter with me
shit james youre hungover
what do you thinks the matter with you
as grady turns away james ponders this then considers the ring of white sugar imprinted on his coat and re sets the donut in precisely the same place
through the steamy panes we see grady approach with the balloon enter
he crosses to a high table sets the balloon down and steps back considering the placement
grady jumps startled and turns
sara has materialized behind a ficus large potting gloves on her hands
sara contd i cant believe you hung up on me you dick
a lot was happening this morning
can you talk
sara nods moves the ficus to another table
walters on campus being the good soldier for wordfest
but hes a basket case
someone stole marilyns jacket last night
and poes missing too
a twelve year old policeman came by the house this morning
did you confess
grady looks up mildly alarmed
your fingerprints were all over the bedroom
that was fast
frowning im kidding
listen about last night
there is something i need to tell
are you limping
why are you limping
oh well thats part of what i need to
did you pass out again grady
did you fall somewhere
well actually yes
i dont remember
listen sara i have to tell you something
sara settles back folds her arms
as grady stares into saras eyes things begin to blur
grady contd want to be with you
sara looks at him
gee grady that sounded so heartfelt
i dont know whether to swoon or smirk
really sara i
sara holds up one gloved hand
i believe you
i believe you want to be with me
but this is not just about me anymore
i know that
i know whats at stake here
no i dont think you do
i havent decided yet
about the baby
grady goes still watches sara strip off the gloves drop them on a table
im not going to draw the map for you on this one grady
times like these you have to do your own navigating
sara turns to leave then stops squinting far down the street
whos that sitting in your car
whats he doing out there
im sort of helping him work through some issues
sara raises an eyebrow then pushes through the door
isnt he lucky
grady watches her ripple across the glass head for the house and wave
james slumped low in the galaxie offers a limp hand in return but its too late
shes already gone
grady cradles the wheel in his bandaged paw while james sits stiffly the orange juice jug bobbing between his thighs
she seemed to take it pretty well
yeah well actually
james looks over
grady contd the moment didnt really present itself
james nods unsurprised then turns back to the window staring at the landscape still sitting oddly still
grady glances at him
at the orange juice jug
grady contd you re not planning on puking in my car are you james
dont be proud james
were in sewickley heights
we could find you a nice golf course to barf on
grady looks over surprised by the james tone
james blinks looks embarrassed
james leer contd i mean
james peers out the window at passing landscape
james leer contd ive got a thing about
places like this
i know what those houses are like
i know what the people are like
james turns eyes flashing with surprise
grady contd hannah mentioned something about an aunt
james nods vaguely then reaches into the ashtray takes a joint between his fingers sniffs it
its my father
he gets it from his doctor
james puts the joint back in the ashtray
its a bit of a scandal
my parents live in a small town
i never heard of it
its a hellhole
three motels and a mannequin factory
my dad worked there for thirty five years
your father worked in a mannequin factory
thats where he met my morn
she was a fry cook in the cafeteria
before that shed been a dancer
what kind of dancer
whatever kind they wanted her to be
in disbelief james leer are you telling me your mother was a stripper
im telling you what i was told by my uncle
and he should know
he ran half a dozen mens clubs in baltimore before he skipped town on a bad debt
didnt you say your mom went to catholic school
when we fall we fall hard
grady takes the joint from the ashtray lights it then notices with surprise james has his hand out
grady contd i thought you were the guy who didnt like to lose control of his emotions
maybe i just needed the moment to present itself
grady glides down the graceful tree lined streets of a modest but well kept neighborhood
james still has the joint now only a tiny nub pinched between his fingers
this is so nice
its like where andy hardy would live
whats it called again
and whats here
unless i miss my bet
james heavy eyelids flutter with surprise
the one that left you
grady raps on the front door then cups his hands against the glass of the living room window squints inside
as he turns away grady sees james sitting on the hood of the galaxie with the box of powdered donuts
hes sitting in the indentation
someone jumped on your car with their butt
how can you tell
you can see the outline of a butt
as grady nods james holds out the donut box
james leer contd want one
smoke the rest of that joint james and you can start on the box
as grady steps onto the back porch james follows
maybe she didnt come here
she came here
well just wait
in the meantime i need you to shimmy through
james stares at the doggy door cut into the back porch door
emily hasnt carried a house key since she was twelve years old
and your hips are as slim as hers
its not that
it just reminded me of you know of whats in the car
in the trunk
a pang of guilt himself oh
well lets try not to think about that
james takes another sad glance at the little door then drops onto ail fours
grady leads james through the house
everything about it speaks of family
even the furniture seems arranged so that people will gather together light a fire talk
it feels really
its the house you want to wake up in on christmas morning
moving off make yourself at home
ill be right back
grady laboring badly on his ankle enters and finds a duffel bag open on the floor its contents a tangle of quickly packed clothes
everything else in the room feels of another time
photographs are everywhere documenting a pretty girls life from first recital to cap and gown
one photograph lies face down
grady turns it over and finds the pretty girl grown into a beautiful young woman standing in a white gown next to a younger grady on their wedding day
james enters french roll in hand and sees a remote control atop the bar
taking it he points it at the wide screen television imbedded in the opposite wall and seconds later george sanders walks into his close up
theres no such thing as a good influence mr
all influence is immoral
grady a pink princess phone to his ear lies on the bed next to a huge teddy bear
into phone yes i m looking for the chancellor
i dont know
she should be in the main hall thank you
james runs through the channels pauses on martin milner and george maharis riding in their curvy corvette
a nelson riddles theme from route booms from below cups a hand over his ear
where are you grady
im in kinship
listen sara theres some things we need to talk about
evenly youre in kinship
but thats not why i called
theres no one here
im just just
doing a little dusting
as grady endeavors to respond two youthful voices cheerfully singing rise from below
for christ sake will you turn that thing down
hes still with you
james in the midst of pouring himself a tumbler of bushmills smiles as judy garland and mickey rooney sing their hearts out in babes in arms
we talked the whole night through
grady shakes his head carries the phone toward the bedroom window
im not here
im not here to as grady watches a late model pontiac bonneville turns into the driveway below him
grady contd reconcile with emily
are you there to not reconcile with her
the bonnevilles trunk pops open revealing three bags of groceries and hank and irene winters both in their s get out
an enormous newfoundland vaults from the backseat
sara eating phone static this whole time interprets gradys silence her own way
saras voice contd goodbye grady
sara you dont understand
trust me i understand
i just want to say something to you grady
dreading it yea
how you choose to live your own life is your business
but you be careful with that boy grady
he belongs to somebody else
as the line goes dead grady watches hank and irene winters disappear below him
james irish whiskey in one hand the pride of humboldt county in the other watches with deep absorption as judy and mickey have a heartfelt conversation
then sensing something
hank and irene winters grocery bags in arm stand frozen
footsteps are heard on the staircase and grady hobbies into view
he tries a smile
hank winters emerges from the bathroom with a roll of tape a bottle of alcohol and some cotton wool
well its infected i can tell you that
im just going to clean it up a bit
its up to you to find someone who knows what theyre doing
put your foot up
grady puts his foot up on hanks lazy boy then notices a book lying face down on the seat
the author on the back cover looks as if hes trying very hard to look consequential
to his surprise grady realizes the author is himself
so hes one of your students this boy
grady glances into the living room where james and irene sit on a long couch together sipping something hot
james is looking out the window a curious expression on his face
grady looks out his own window sees the newfoundland sniffing curiously at the galaxies trunk
when he glances back into the living room he and james make brief eye contact then blink look away
hes a good kid
maybe a little messed up
well im sure with the proper guidance hell be fine
grady tries to read hanks face is he messing with him
but hank gives nothing away
grady nods to the book
what made you pull out that old thing
shrugging i was thinking of you
its no arsonists daughter but i guess you know that
its a young mans book
it got me remembering how it felt to be young
maybe i should read it
oh i dont think theres any danger of you aging prematurely grady
grady doesnt have to read hanks face this time
wheres emily hank
i dont know if shed want me to tell you that grady
im not going to stalk her
want to know where i stand
hank looks up incredulous
where you stand
embarrassed l just want to say im sorry
shes in philadelphia seeing linda aahby
frowning nothings wrong
they went to wellesley together
i havent been doing a lot of sleeping lately
my editors in town and i have the book to finish and ah right
grady starts to continue then stops cowed by something in hanks tone something dismissive
instead he looks away toward the living room and catches sight of james again sitting alone now with his big cup of cocoa
listen hank im sorry about ail this
i didnt come here to upset you and irene
i want you to know that
why did you come here grady
grady gestures vaguely
i just wanted to see her i guess emily
and to see you too you and irene
and to let everyone know that even though it may be difficult to comprehend now this everything thats happening its not forever
it doesnt mean goodbye
give me a break grady
hank snaps off the tape slaps gradys ankle
grady glowers darkly at the road then puts his hand up against the heating vent which apparently is not putting out any heat
im having a really good time professor tripp
grady glances over sees james burrowing into the ziploc
im really happy for you james
but do me a favor will you
lay off my dope
that stuffs not for amateurs
james looks at ziploc as grady fiddles with the heat i just wanted a little sip
squinting at him i just wanted a little sip
tell me james exactly what point was it that you turned into serpent boy
probably about the time you gave me the codeine pills last night
grady stops with the heater glances over at james whose face bears not the slightest trace of irony
look james you appear to possess like many an aspiring writer before you by the way a rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made
however i think its best if for the moment at least taking the ziploc we abstain
youre mad at me arent you
youre mad because i shot your girlfriends dog
it wasnt her dog
its her husbands stopping who said anything about girlfriend
james eyes shift slowly as if to say who are you kidding
okay james i wish you hadnt shot my girlfriends dog
even though poe and i werent exactly what youd call simpatico thats no reason for him to take two in the chest
still the fact remains that im the one who took you up into the chancellors bedroom
im the one who has to take the blame
i dont know what the hell i was thinking
sure you do
you were thinking thats no cap gun in that kids overcoat
you were thinking i cant let that kid get on
the bus alone he might never get on the bus again
you were thinking ive got to find a way to distract this kid
so you did
it was in its way a noble act
thanks for the halo james but ive
never done that much thinking ahead in my life ever
james looks out the window pondering this
so why did you take me up there
feeling for the heat again i don t know james
i don t know why i do half the things i do
looking over why do you wear that coat
james looks down a little defensive
james fall semester first day of class it was degrees and you were wearing the coat
james just blinks no ready answer available
thats why they all give you such a hard time in workshop
because of my coat
because you act like a goddamn spook all the time
not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you
james face hardens
he looks away
the hell i am
yes you are
my stuff stinks
i know it
you said so yourself
i never said that
yes you did
to your friend crabtree
is he any good
and you said not yet he isnt
i heard you myself
i didnt mean it that way
its okay professor tripp
carrie howard the others they re right
my stories are annoying
they go on and on and on and the longer they go on the more annoying they become until finally you just want to grab something heavy and shut up
carrie and howard dont know what the fuck theyre talking about okay
the entire class combined including the lovely hannah green has about one tenth of one percent the talent you have okay
james stares blankly at grady then turns his face to the window
he ponders gradys words the praise inherent in them
a hint of pleasure glints in his eyes
but last night
who cares what
i said last night james i i was drunk i was stoned
id been bitten by a dog
my wife had left me
how bout cutting me some slack
quietly im sorry
and dont be so goddamn sensitive
who cares what anybody thinks anyway
you want to
be a good writer
you want to be a great writer
then stop giving a damn what other people think
most of them havent thought in
james turns studies gradys face as it flickers in the first headlights of the evening
let me spell it
out for you james
books dont mean anything
not to anybody
arsonists daughter meant something
grady smiles contemptuously
i mean it
it means something to me
its one of the reasons i came to school here
to be in your class
to be taught by you
quietly its one of the reasons i wanted to become a writer
grady stares ahead watching the darkness tumble away before the wide sweep of the galaxies headlights
well for that if nothing else james im sorry
grady rolls into a space near the coffee shop and james slides out
grady stays put hands still on the wheel
in a minute
get us a table
james nods pushes past the glass doors into the coffee shop and a big redhead in a waitress cap leads him to a table with a view of the highway
grady watches james stick figure in black brogues slide into the booth and open his big laminated menu
finally as if concluding some internal debate grady kicks open his door steps out
grady rests his forehead against the payphone as he speaks
c a r v e i
thats right carvel
yes im sure
its outside scranton
grady straightens up takes a peek at james sitting by himself on the far side of the coffee shop
you have no listing
okay well lady at this very moment as we speak im looking of a resident of carvel pennsylvania
i think hed be pretty interested to learn that the good people of bell atlantic have misplaced his entire hometown
its not like im making this up as i go along grady stops his own words ringing in his head
grady contd never mind
grady upends james knapsack sifts through an autographed postcard of frances farmer
a wrinkled box of chiclets
then he notices errol flynns eyebrows peeking at him from the knapsacks side pouch
he takes the book opens it
a library notice james seiwyn leer is three weeks overdue
under address it says only on file
but if one was to dial the phone number odds are it wont be the night janitor at the greyhound depot who picks up
the remains of a fried clam sandwich sit before james as he turns his attention to a giant piece of lemon meringue pie
grady sips only coffee stealing glances at the cars that whip by on the highway beyond the window
want a bite
thats why youre having them
jesus james you make it sound like were in a tennessee williams play
i dont have spells
what would you call them then
i dont know
james shrugs spears a fluffy chunk of pie
its because you dont eat
when nobodys looking
grady watches a pair of headlights approach
mouth full garbled i just worry about you thats all
james words finally register
grady looks at him
you just worry about yourself james
just then a long pale wand of light splinters against the coffee shop windows and a car sweeps into the parking lot
grady follows it with his eyes rises
james leer contd where you going
you just sit here and
grady moves off then stops looking back at james and his giant piece of pie still troubled by his words
as grady limps out of the coffee shop he finds an older man in a tuxedo standing in the open door of a gleaming black mercedes
beyond him in the front passenger seat a woman in mink examines her eye shadow in the tiny mirror of the sun visor
eyeing grady dubiously professor tripp
this is my wife amanda
re their clothes looks like ive dashed a wonderful evening
we were on our way to a benefit
but as luck would have it the club was on the way so
snapping shut the visor we were able to put in an appearance
otherwise we wouldve been here earlier
well thats ail right
james and i had a little dinner
well certainly well reimburse you
thats not necessary
i just felt
it might be good for james to be with his family this weekend
well of course we can understand that
grady considers the two glittering ghosts before him
they seem to be waiting
let me go get him
grady turns for the coffee shop then stops looks back
grady contd i hope you wont consider this forward of me amanda but i wonder if i might ask
did you ever attend catholic school
amanda leers eyes narrow ever so slightly
james is glowering at the parking lot as grady returns
im not going with them
things things are a little weird with me right now and i well i have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad
happened to you
and if you hang around me long enough something bad is going to happen trust me
thats why i need you to go home
im not going with them
james like it or not theyre your parents
theyre not my parents
theyre my grandparents
my parents are dead
grady stares at james wearily
my father had his own airplane he used to fly up to quebec
one christmas he and my mom were flying up to our house in the laurentians when the plane went down
it was in the newspaper
grady doesnt flinch unpersuaded
my father was a senior vice president at dravo
my mother was a socialite
her maiden name was guggenheim
grady starts to protest then pauses
i remember that
five or six years ago
their plane went down right outside scranton
sardonically near carvel
im sorry about all that
i just i dont like to talk about my family
they treat me like a freak
nodding towards amanda she makes me sleep in
the basement of my own house
my parents left it to me
grady glances toward the parking lot studies the contours of fred leers face
james come on
that man is obviously your father
you look just like him
james looks down at the table takes a deep breath and speaks in a voice heavy with implication
theres a reason for that
gradys addled brain grapples with this dark little riddle finally deciphers what james is suggesting
get out of here
thats why she hates me
thats why she makes me sleep in the basement
in the crawl space with the rats and the casks of amontillado
as grady lifts him from the booth james attempts a plaintive tone but his hearts not in it
as fred leer slams the back door of the mercedes grady waves vaguely peers into the darkness of the back seat
take care of him
oh dont worry
well take care of him
you can be sure of that
fred leer hits the gas and swings the mercedes around in a tight little arc feathering gradys pants from the knee down with a pudding of ice and mud
grady glances down at his spattered self then notices sitting on the front passenger seat james knapsack
grady grabs it turns
as the mercedes begins to pull away and james turns elbows on the back dash his pale face slack
spying grady he raises one limp hand and then as if it were held by a string lets it drop
grady contd softly hey
grady sits in the green glow of
the radio dial smoking a joint
he glances at the knapsack sees james the love parade he reaches in takes the manuscript and in the light that rains from the parking lamp overhead begins to read
gradys house looks like a three dollar whore on a block full of nuns
music blares light blazes from every window and there are so many cars grady is forced to leave the galaxie in the middle of the street
times square before the ball drops
grady enters scans the room then shoulders his way to the stairs
hannah green sits on the sofa twisting a long strand of hair around her finger as she reads a thick manuscript
she slaps the page she is reading back onto the stack at her thigh
embarrassed i know i shouldnt have but there it was just sort of lying out and i couldnt resist and and i suck
no its okay
i just cant believe i left it out in the open like that
crabtree hasnt been in here has he
i dont know maybe i dont think so
gradys mind races with unfortunate possibilities but only briefly his immediate thoughts are elsewhere
you dont remember where that aunt worked do you
he shot the chancellors dog didnt he
the blind one
actually hes not the chancellor s what
at first the police thought he just ran away but this afternoon dr
gaskell found some blood spots on the carpet jesus
crabtree said it sounded like something james would be messed up in
he doesnt even know james
just then crabtrees voice bellows in the hallway outside
where are you grady looks anxiously toward the door
the aunt hannah
where did you take james that day
i told you sewickly heights
i need the street
i dont know grady
i just dropped him on a corner
as grady starts to turn away hannah hooks her finger inside his belt buckle
ive been waiting ail night for you
grady looks at hannahs hand where it rests
he looks terrified
listen hannah im flattered really but right now i bursting in tripp where the hell
crabtree stops takes in the tableau before him
crabtree contd oh im sorry
am i interrupting a
student teacher conference
grady delicately removes hannahs hand from his buckle points at crabtree
you stay there
crabtree cocks his head toward the reams of paper stacked on gradys desk
do you actually think i would sneak in here and read your book without asking you
gee i dont know
i dont seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite people over to trash my living room
sometimes we have to improvise
ignoring him think hannah
does james have any friends
i mean besides you and
nothing hes just been sort of i dont know
lets go rescue him
only one problem
i dont know where they live
wait a minute
the university must know where he lives
its a little late to call admissions
is it a little late to call the chancellor
i dont know
two sixty two baxter drive
grady and crabtree turn see hannah sitting on the corner of gradys desk with the white pages open on her lap
hannah green contd theyre in the book
crabtree snaps james manuscript closed
you know based on what ive read this is a very exciting piece of material this big parade
its love facade and what do you mean based on what youve read
you skimmed two chapters at miles an hour while gargling methamphetamines
ive been doing this a long time tripp
i feel this kid in my bones
only in your bones
grady smirks glances at crabtree but gets a surprise crabtree offers no snappy come back no antic wordplay
he just stares out the window his voice distant
i think i might be right
ive felt it before
as crabtrees voice trails off grady studies him
how bad is it for you
and god knows i dont exactly fit the new corporate profile
grady and crabtree look at each other a moment then crabtree smiles gives a little shrug and picks up james knapsack rummaging through the contents
crabtree contd so tell me about you and the chancellor
whats to tell
plenty im sure
but for what its worth
crabtree fishes out the biography of erroll flynn gives it a look
i like her
grady peers at the stars his voice barely audible
the battered galaxie floats up a narrow road gliding through a canyon of mansion walls and the occasional winding drive
up ahead a stone post marker with the numerals
grady kills the headlights
this is it
grady limping like an aging prizefighter leads crabtree up a steep incline toward an enormous three story house
the leers mercedes gleams in the shadows
there must be two dozen windows on
how are we supposed to find his
i told you
they keep him chained in the basement
light glows from a low basement window
from one side a woman is heard singing
grady and crabtree pause listen
why should i care though he gave me the air
why should i cry heave a sigh and wonder why
and wonder why
crabtree and grady look at each other
grady moves to the window and raps on the glass
a moment later james peeks out
seeing grady his face brightens briefly unguarded then quickly resumes its usual leerian aspect
he motions with his hand as if to say that way
the door swings open to reveal james leer decked out in a pair of red ink stained pajamas sagging badly in the seat
he looks like one of santas elves
what are you guys doing here
were springing you
get some pants on
as they step inside grady gives james pjs the once over
i cant believe you made fun of my robe
electric candelabras light a large converted cellar whose walls are crowded with movie posters and lobby cards
there are stacks of what look suspiciously like library books and an enormous baroque bed complete with canopy
i like what youve done with it
whens captain nemo moving in
the candelabras were my grans
oh christ dont start on ol gran or well leave you here
hey i heard all about it the parents the grandparents the china town thing and i believe you okay
thats why were here
now go get dressed
james scoops up the shirt grady lent him
can i i mean do you mind if i wear this again
ah wear whatever you want
james flinches stung then disappears into a bathroom
nosing around the room oh come on tripp
cut the kid some slack
its just ail that crap he spins out
just once id like to know if the little bastard is telling the truth
i know thats always been real important to you
key check this out
crabtree leans over an old royal typewriter reads from the freshly typed page curling from the carriage
finally the door opened
it was a shock to see him shuffling into the room like an aging prizefighter
with an amused smile sound like anyone we know
resuming but it was later when the great man squinted into the bitter glow or twilight
frowning bitter glow of twilight
this kid definitely needs an editor
resuming and muttered simply it means nothing
all of it
nothing that the true shock came
it was then that the boy understood that his heros true injuries lay hidden in a darker place
crabtree stops abruptly
crabtree hesitates then
reads on his heart once capable of inspiring others so completely could no longer inspire so much as itself
it beat now only out of habit
it beat now only because it could
grady nods his face unreadable then james returns
james stops sees the two men looking at him
you all right professor tripp
come on lets blow before ol gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast
oh well thats just it
shes been coming down here every half hour or so to sort of check on me
if im not here she might
call the police or
so we decoy her
stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she wont know the difference
like in against all flags
only they use a couple big hams
crabtree and james turn
ive got something better than a teddy bear
cut to poe as hes lowered delicately onto james bed
grady strategically arranges the coverlet gently adjusting poes head so only a tuft of fur shows
he steps back joining crabtree and james for an assessment
sweet dreams jimmy
the lights are still blazing the front door is wide open but not a soul remains
a quiet disaster the only sound an lp playing meekly on the stereo
james passes through first ignoring the tortilla chips popping under his shoes then crabtree and grady appear
things mustve picked up after we left
crabtree pats gradys cheek heads upstairs
crabtrees door is closing as grady hobbles into view
sticking his head out ye es
grady looks down sees james leers black brogues sitting on the floor outside crabtrees door
the door closes the latch clicks and grady is left alone the bossa nova floating softly in the air
hannah green lies tangled in the sheets surrounded by little colonies of gradys manuscript
grady studies her then detects something on the floor
the red boots
delicately he lifts the sheet
hannah greens feet finally revealed in ail their naked glory prove to be thick wide and ordinary
the tv is on
grady steps to the doorway pauses
a head cranes over the sofa
its the goatee kid from thaw hail
how are you is it joe
i didnt even know this was your house until about an hour ago
dont sweat it
oh professor tripp
you know last semester what i said that time in office hours i hope theres no hard feelings
i mean i was breaking up with this girl at the time and my car was ail fucked up and well i was pretty bent in general
its cool jeff
i just want you to know thats why i dropped your class and said all that shit about the university stealing my money and you being a pseudo faulknerian nobody
grady sits quietly on the porch steps a joint burning in his fingers
to his left perched atop a haagen dazs container is a telephone
as he pulls it into his lap a lamp in the living room pirouettes clumsily spins free of the cord and shatters on the floor
grady blinks looks away and dials just as
the clattering cough of an engine is heard and a van appears
stenciled on its side panel is kravniks sporting goods the van slows almost coasting then abruptly bursts past gradys house and disappears around the corner
grady frowns then realizes a mans voice is coming from the receiver in his lap
the voice is groggy
it is walter gaskells voice
grady says nothing as if wondering what hes doing
walters voice contd whos this
its grady walter
i know its you grady i just
christ grady do you know what time it is
looking at his watch i have
thats not right is it
its three thirty grady
this is important
what is it grady
im in love with your wife
im in love with her
then walters voice returns even administrative
are you drinking
grady sips on his roach responds in a pinched voice
nevertheless id like to see you in my office monday morning
as the line goes dead grady stares at the phone wondering if he has in fact just done what he thinks hes just done
a car rattles down the street newspapers pinwheeling from the window
a heavy thhnk hits the driveway outside and grady blinks
sitting in his pink robe bleary eyed he reconsiders the piece of paper curling from his typewriter
gradys pov of the page its obvious hes been sitting like this for some time
just then the distinctive purr of an engine is heard
grady peers through the window watches a cab
glide to the curb below
a citroen ds
grady steps onto the porch unintentionally punting a bottle of iron city beer onto the front lawn
i tried to call but apparently theres something wrong
sara leans down replaces the uncradled phone
sara contd with your phone
unfortunately mine was ringing loud and clear this morning
grady doesnt know what this means but hes pretty sure its not good
it seems one of our students is missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed
slumping to the porch im sorry sara
ive been trying to tell you
its all my sara raises her hand silencing him
im not very happy with you right now grady
but more importantly walters not very happy and hes gotten the police involved
they seem to think james leer is somehow responsible for all of this
you wouldnt happen to know where james is would you grady
and the jacket
in the backseat of the
gradys hand hangs in mid air gesturing pointlessly to the driveway where the only thing that exists is an oil stain roughly the shape of north dakota
grady contd someone stole my car
someone stole my car
i parked it right there last night
are you sure you parked it there
of course im sure
ah christ the puberty police are back
sara turns sees officer pupcik cruising to the curb
ill deal with this
you dig up james
crabtree sits in bed flipping through the pages of the love parade while stroking a tiny tuft of hair that is the sole visible part of
swinging in is he awake
im afraid hes pretty worn out poor kid
theres a police officer standing on the porch and i dont think hes going away
from under the covers that same guy
crabtree peels back the blankets and james leer opens one eye
so i hear
studying grady no offense professor tripp but you look sorta crappy
hes right you look horrible
thank you frankie and annette
james swings his pale little legs to the floor and walks bare assed across the room to retrieve his bvds
its the chancellor
well i gave you my opinion
and we both thank you for that but were
im fine right
fit as a fucking fiddle
grady squints at james as he pulls on his pants
shut up james
so whats the problem
a tad tense there is no problem
did i say there was a problem
as james head pops through gradys fully buttoned flannel he and crabtree exchange a knowing glance at once referring to and excluding grady
hows it coming back there professor tripp
who do you think it is
the chancellors here
does she mean does she know about
its walters dog and yes she does
but lets spare her the details
come on your shoes are in the hail
this book of yours
its not bad
not bad at all
james stops considers this piece of news with a look of deep seriousness then nods
as james shuffles off into the hail crabtree looks at grady his eyes dancing with excitement
i want to publish this
ive got to
i think theyll let me
with a little editorial guidance it could be brilliant
between you and officer pupcik out there he can be the next jean genet
its been awhile since somebody wrote a good book in jail
sara and grady stand by as pete pupcik deposits james in the back of the squad car slams the door
as i told the chancellor professor im
just going to run james here over to the university
itll be up to dr
gaskell where we go from there
grady nods leans in the window to james
dont worry james ill figure something out
im not worried
youre not worried are you
im a little worried james
i dont care if they expel me
i probably should be expelled
well lets see if we can keep that from happening
james nods and grady starts to step back from the car
even if i end up going to jail
james smiles his crooked grin
james leer contd youre still the best teacher i ever had
on this pete pupcik pulls away leaving grady standing on the curb watching the back of james head framed in the rear window of the police car growing smaller
this is not what the university has in mind when it promises a liberal education grady
would walter really press charges
its within the realm
he takes his souvenirs pretty seriously
and he was just a wee bit prickly this morning
grady detecting something in saras tone turns watches her take a drag on her cigarette
sara contd you didnt happen to call the house last night did you grady
i think i might have
and what do you think you might have said
i think i mightve said i was in love with you
saras face remains
grady contd he told you
he told me
and what did you say
i said it didnt sound like you
sara tosses her cigarette in
the gutter gets into her car and dives away
grady looks after her sadly then turns sees crabtree standing on the porch wearing a shirt which claims ativan chases the clouds away
so what do we do now
find the jacket
exactly how do we do that
first i see if hannah will let me borrow her car
it seems to me that girl would let you borrow her pancreas
hannah wrapped loosely in cotton sheets smiles as she listens to the goatee kid who sits cross legged at the foot of her bed fully clothed
im telling you the tango is ail about latent homosexual love
look at the way they dance its sodomy
laughing stop it
hannah looks up sees grady in the doorway and blushes
she pulls the sheet up gives an oddly formal wave
jeff eases off the bed past grady uneasily
if youre really interested in discussing that business with the tango try the guy at the end of the hall
jeff nods puzzled then goes
he cribbed that from borges
it beats whats your major
grady nods detecting a new aloofness in her voice
anyway i was wondering if i could borrow your car
mines sort of out of commission
the keys are on the dresser next to
to your book
the hitch in hannahs voice hangs in the room like a cloud
i uh i didnt finish i
that good hub
no its not that its
hannah glances at the huge stack of paper sitting on her dresser then hesitantly looks back to grady
its just that you know i was thinking about how in class youre always telling us that writers make choices at least the good ones
and dont get me wrong
im not saying the book isnt really great i mean really great but at times its well very detailed you know with the genealogies of everyones horses and ail the
dental records and so on and i dont know maybe im wrong but it sort of reads in places like well actually like
with trepidation you didnt make any choices at all
and i was wondering if it might not be different if maybe when you wrote you werent always
under the influence
stung hh huh
well thanks for the thought but as shocking as this may sound im not the first writer to sip a little weed
and furthermore it might interest you to know that one book i wrote as you say under the influence happened to win a little something called the pen award which
by the way i accepted under the influence
hannah nods averts her eyes and immediately grady feels ridiculous
he starts to say something but instead gathers his manuscript and exits
crabtree dressed now studies the freight in gradys arms as he reaches the bottom of the stairs
want some help with that
passing by dont touch it
crabtree sucks on a kool driving hannahs rattling renault too fast shifting gears apparently at random
grady rides shotgun still wearing the robe over his clothes the wonder boys manuscript sitting like a watermelon on his lap looking all in all fairly pathetic
let me get this straight
jerry nathan owes you money
so as collateral he gives you his car
only now im starting to think the car wasnt exactly jerrys to give
so whose car is it
my guess vernon hardapple
the hood jumper
he said a few things that lead me to believe the cars his
thats my car motherfucker
we find vernon we find the car
we find the car
we find the jacket
theres only one problem tripp
we dont know his real name
we just made it up
in fact we made the whole guy up
no wonder he screwed us over
bill mazeroski legendary pittsburgh pirate second baseman large as a macys day float his weathered image scaling three floors on the brick face of a riverfront crabtree takes a corner
recklessly immediately slows and blinks in amazement
how did you know
call it a hunch
parked in front of kravniks sporting goods is the white van
a few feet behind the battered galaxie
id call it genius
grady steps out strips off the robe and drops the lumpy leviathan that is his manuscript on the front seat
its good to know im still talented at something
keep the motor running
grady peers into the backseat squinting against the wind that swirls around him
errol flynns face leers back at him
but no jacket
grady slides in pops the glove box and frowns at the ziploc of humboldt county
he pockets it anyway then spies something else
james leers little pearl handled pistol
grady takes it rotates it in his palm
sunlight glints off the chrome barrel and everything slowly turns to a crabtree stomps on his kool
grady looks very much like a man who has pulled off the road to take a nap
what the hell
as grady lolls behind the steering wheel a cloud appears hovering then slowly mutates and grady realizes its not a cloud at all its marilyn monroe standing by the side
mirror wearing a bright pink dress under her wedding jacket
i know you
marilyns face swims before gradys eyes but theres something wrong with it
this girls eyes are brown and besides shes
marilyn contd double dickel on the rocks
the last of the fairy dust evaporates and grady finds standing before him in a pink jersey dress and marilyn monroes wedding jacket ola the pregnant waitress from the hi
i never forget a drink
i never forget an oola
suddenly there is a heavy click
grady starts to turn but his head wont move largely because the barrel of a german nine is pressed to his temple
gradys eyes slide
to oola move away cupcake
hes got a gun
whos got a gun
youve got a gun motherfucker
whys he calling you vernon
whys he sitting in my car
hes crazy thats why
he probably calls everybody vernon
youre the only vernon i know
actually im wrong
i once knew a vernon peabody at penguin u
to oola cupcake
you re not going to shoot him are you
im going to shoot him
if he doesnt put that gun down
its just a souvenir
they dont even make the caps anymore
i know a gun when i see one
and thats a gun
grady lifts his arm points the little pearl handled pistol to the dark clouds overhead
crabtree jumps as the tiny pistol at the end of gradys arm flashes makes a feeble pop in the wind
vernon stands half hunched stunned
are you crazy
the gunshot seems to have cleared gradys head
he stares at the gun watches vernon wrest it from his hand
vernon contd get out
whats the matter with you
cant you see the condition my girls in
as grady gets out of the car vernon places his hand on oolas tummy
you all right cupcake
a rude squeal breaks the silence rubber scratching asphalt and grady oola and vernon turn to see hannah greens rattling renault lurching awkwardly toward them
gears grinding tires smoking crabtree fish tails wildly then kicks open the passenger door
grady doesnt move an inch watching in mute amazement as crabtree whistles by proceeds halfway down the block then turns back for another pass
who the hell is that
a manhattan book editor murdering a mormon girls clutch
the car bucks crazily picks up speed and crabtree swiping aside a flutter of manuscript pages that have taken flight inside the car begins to veer right toward grady vernon
vernon steps into the street levels the german nine
vernon contd pull off you crazy motherfucker
frantic grady steps between vernon the german nine and the oncoming crabtree
hes just a lousy driver
crabtree fans the wheel wildly goes into a slide and the passenger door snaps wide releasing what looks to be a flock of white doves into the wind whipped sky
only these aint birds
these are pages
seven years of pages
crabtree goes into another slide one hops the curb and smashes flat into the weathered glove of bill mazeroski painted on the front wail of kravniks sporting goods
as hannah greens radiator explodes crabtree steps free of the car and looks skyward
its a ticker tape parade ail the way down the street ending in the frigid waters of the ohio river
grady contd to vernon i take it back
vernon drives oola at his side
in the back crabtree puffs philosophically on a kool while grady sits grimly with the sad remains of his manuscript seven rumpled pages one of which bears the watermark of
a shoe print
naturally you have copies
i have an alternate version of the first chapter
youll be all right then
look at carlyle when he lost his luggage
that was maccaulay
or hemingway when hadley lost all those stories
he was never able to reproduce them
look tripp i dont want to depreciate the loss here but perhaps in a sense this nodding to the pages is for the best
gradys eyes shift study crabtree
kind of a sign youre saying
in a sense
i dont think so
in my experience signs are usually a lot more subtle
let me get this straight
all that paper that went into the river
that was the only copy
glowering at crabtree and youre saying its some kind of sign
what the fucks the matter with you
im just saying that sometimes subconsciously a person will put themselves in a situation perhaps even create that situation in order to have an arena in which to work out
an unresolved issue
its a covert way if you will of addressing a problem
vernon stares at crabtree as if hes from another planet
ill tell you the problem
you behind the wheel
theres your fucking problem
thats pretty simplistic dont you think
hey pal you dont start doing crazy eights in the middle of the street none of this happens
did you or did you not have a gun to his head
he was trying to steal my car
ail right all right its done
theres no need to talk about it
they ride in silence for a moment then oola turns glances at grady and his little sheaf of pages
so what was it about
as grady looks up your book
what was the story
grady stares into oolas sweet brown eyes
i dont know
oolas brow wrinkles
crabtree glances at his old friend genuine compassion in his eyes
what he means is its difficult to distill the essence of a book sometimes
it lives in the mind
yeah but you gotta know what its about right
i mean if you didnt know what it was about why were you writing it
i couldnt stop
grady james leers hollow knapsack in hand stands with crabtree at the campus entrance as vernon and oola prepare to leave in the galaxie
can i ask you a question
grady glances at little round oola
boy or girl
as long as it looks like her i dont care
you know what im saying
grady watches vernon give oola a kiss on the forehead
for the lift
only do me a favor
stop calling me vernon
crabtree leans into grady whispers
the jacket tripp
we need the jacket
grady contd oh right
about that jacket
grady looks at the waitress in her pink jersey dress snuggled up in the silk wedding jacket
it used to belong to marilyn monroe
she had small shoulders like you
most people dont know that
as oola smiles pleased vernon shakes his head
man that book of yours mustve been one nutty motherfucking ride
vernon points an imaginary gun fires a friendly cap into grady and pulls away
crabtree stands stunned
you mind explaining what you just did
grady watches the shrinking galaxie sail under a drooping nordfest banner lost in thought
came to my senses
meanwhile what is james supposed to do
pray for walter gaskell to come to his
walter gaskell isnt going to send james leer to jail crabs
i know that
do you know he wont expel him
but i dont think that matters
thats very enlightened professor
its comforting to know that americas children have you for a teacher
grady blinks ponders this briefly then looks toward the buildings of the campus his voice still distant
nobody teaches a writer anything
you tell them what you know
you tell them to find their voice and stick with it because thats all you have in the end
you tell the ones who have it to keep at it and you tell the ones who dont to keep at it too
because thats the only way to get where youre going
ruefully of course it helps if you know where you want to go
thoughtfully maybe thats the only thing that and sara thats made the last seven years worthwhile
grady slides james knapsack off his shoulder smiles cryptically as he considers it
grady contd as for james he doesnt need me anymore
without warning grady tosses crabtree the knapsack
grady contd hes got you
crabtree stares at the saggy green canvas in his hands watches grady walk away
what can i do
gee i dont know crabs
over his shoulder improvise
youre good at that
grady continues on leaving crabtree to stand alone as he walks toward the buildings in the distance
im sorry tripp
grady stops turns
you peeked didnt you
grady considers this
it doesnt seem to matter anymore it really had the makings tripp
there was a lot to admire
never read anything quite like it
if there was a kentucky derby for editorial bullshit crabtrees last three utterances would finish win place and show
and grady knows it
youre not just trying to make me feel better
crabtree looks directly at grady his old friend
crabtree and grady stare into each others eyes
both are acutely aware of the subtext of this conversation
well thanks for that crabs
gradually steps are heard coming from the stairwell then grady limps into view
grady surveys the room
he walks to a window the same window he stood at two afternoons ago when reading james leers story
a chill breeze pitches the fabric of his shirt as he studies the barren benches and icy walkways of the quad
turns away settles behind his desk and reaching into his pocket removes the seven remaining pages of his manuscript
he considers them then folds them in half length wise
he continues folding the top right corner down into a triangle along the first crease
then from the third floor window a paper airplane glides into view soaring then dropping soaring then dropping again and again graceful as a dove
grady hobbles into the lobby just as one of the auditorium doors swings open
applause swells and he spies sara standing inside talking to a student usher
as the door glides shut
as grady hustles forward q wine glass in hand intercepts him
i have to tell you
i took another look at arsonists daughter the other night
theres a description of a bald cypress that left me breathless
pushing past him thanks q
i felt the same way about the bank tellers breasts in your last one
grady enters but sara is
he picks his way behind the back row scanning the aisles
hey professor tripp
its carrie mcwhirty james tormentor from workshop
grady takes another look around then drops into the seat next to her
if youre looking for hannah shes on the aisle
but grady looks anyway
hannah sits a dozen rows down the aisle hair pulled back in a clip glorious skin gloaming
the goatee kid sits close beside her
whos that guy shes with
didnt he used to be in workshop
he comes from a long line of tango dancers
walter turns over the last page of his prepared notes
and now as those of you whove been with us in previous years know we have a tradition of sorts here at wordfest
im speaking of course of the plums
an anticipatory buzz sweeps through the audience as walter begins to read from a separate list
this weekend susan lowery of north braddock found a publisher for her childrens book
the loneliest prawn susan stand up
as a chubby woman stands to acknowledge the applause grady cranes his neck searching the sea of seats
to his surprise he finds crabtree sitting prominently in the front row in his shirtsleeves smiling his spookily complacent smile
james is next to him now wearing crabtrees metallic sports coat over gradys flannel shirt
and robert wilkenson who many of you know for his city beat column in the post gazette has found a home with putnam for his new three rivers thriller
a short balding man stands briefly then walters voice takes a shift in tone
now this next one i think is especially exciting to announce because it concerns a student here at the university
our own james leer a sophomore in english literature has found a publisher for his first novel which i believe is called the lovely parade
grady blinks leans forward and watches walter smile warmly toward the front row
crabtree gives james a jab in the ribs and slowly awkwardly james rises
stunned carrie mcwhirty turns to the girl next to her
i have a class with him
james hangs like a scarecrow from a nail waiting as the applause slows then sputters then dies out altogether
the guys kind of an alien probe if you know what i mean
grady in a last attempt to save james from himself cups hi his hands around his mouth
take a bow james
james turns spots grady in the back row then a sheepish grin on his face spreads his arms hangs his head and takes his first sweet public bow
grady contd softly wonder boy
and finally and perhaps not least importantly terry crabtree of bartizan has also decided to publish my own book a critical exploration of the union of marilyn monroe and joe
dimaggio and its function in american mythopoetics which tentatively ive entitled the last american marriage
wild obsequious applause
grady smiles cynically watches walter take a brief dignified bow of his own
until next year
thank you everyone
the lights come up
as the auditorium empties crabtree shakes walters hand and jeff and his goatee escort hannah green down the aisle where she drapes her lovely arms around james
grady watches them ail sitting alone in his row when suddenly sara appears over james shoulder
she says something congratulatory turns and exits out a side door
grady blinks scrambles up
grady bursts into the corridor
somewhere a heavy metal door closes
grady rushes on
grady limping badly turns a corner and sees a door
he moves to it pushes past
and finds himself standing in a stairwell
he leans out over the railing peers down
its a steep drop very
steep ending in a small rectangular space a kind of basement office with vending machines plastic chairs and a collapsible card table
grady turns back to the door he came through pushes against it
he sighs looks back at the stairs his ailing ankle then sits
he fishes out the ziploc of marijuana considers the perfectly roiled joint floating atop the bag of buds but for once isnt up to it
the sound of footsteps echoes far below and hopeful theyre saras grady pulls himself up peers over the railing
its traxler with a broom a big plastic bag
looking up hey professor tripp
grady considers the ziploc in his hand looks down again
do you get high sam
only when im working
grady hangs over the railing and lets fly the ziploc
it pinwheels through the vortex of stairs lands at sams feet
are you serious
as a heart attack
thanks whoa professor tripp careful here
grady is still hanging over the railing but looking dizzy now
his eyelids flutter and he tips forward a steinway on a window ledge and as he starts to drop
there is a sharp jerk on his collar a shirt button caroms off his cheek and slowly he is hauled back
grady what are you doing you idiot
grady looks up into saras freckled face
looking for you
he wants to say more he opens his mouth but then
all faintly at first then more forcefully calling gradys name calling so insistently that the earth seems to rush upward until we see that she is
kissing him or something and all goes softly
grady lies in a powder blue paper gown surrounded by blue plastic curtains in a blue room
through a gap in the curtains he can see the bottle of glucose that drips slowly into his arm and beyond a window
flakes of snow fall outside
the door squeals a shadow ripples across the blue then the curtains part and a resident with a clipboard appears
his nametag says greenhut
i passed out
ive been doing that a lot lately
so i hear
youve also been smoking a lot of marijuana i understand
do you think thats why ive been having these
grabbing james term spells
how long have you been having them
the last month maybe
how long have you been smoking marijuana
agnew was vice president i believe
thats probably not the problem then
what about your lifestyle
any major changes recently
ive been trying to finish a book
and your wife left you
is that in my chart
i spoke with the woman who saved your life
youre lucky she came along when she did
grady considers the larger ramifications of this statement i know
tapping the glucose bottle you need to see a doctor mr
and i think you really ought to consider seeing a therapist as well
she told you about
her dog yes
actually it was her husbands dog
greenhut glances up looking grady in the eyes for the first time and grady stops
you have a drug problem all right
on top of that you have a bite on your ankle that is severely infected
we pumped you with antibiotics so youll be fine but another day or two and you might have lost the foot
as for your spells
im guessing theyre a result of the anxiety youve been experiencing lately
theyre anxiety attacks
thats a little disappointing
better luck next time
so is my friend
is sara still here
theres no one here
i have to see her
as soon as possible
greenhut studies grady calibrating the desperation in his eyes then takes a quick glance at his watch
if you really want to leave i cant stop you
but im going to write you a prescription for a course of ampicillin and i want you to follow it to the end no matter how stupid you decide to
be with everything else
grady sits in a wheelchair watching the snow fail around him as a nurse escorts him through the tunnel of glass that connects one building to another
i wonder if you could show me something
grady stares through the glass
there are only two babies on display heads dented from natural delivery skin purple and crazy with veins
are these the only ones you have
the nurses eyes crinkle
grady contd kidding
grady pays a taxi cab driver then turns looks at the gaskell house
peers into the living room window
he stands helplessly then spies the greenhouse standing ghostly across the yard feathers of snow drifting onto its roof melting
grady hobbles to the greenhouse puts both hands to the glass as he looks inside
dispirited he pulls away but not before leaving
the imprints of his hands perfectly etched in the frost of the glass
the snow continues to fall as grady lumbers down the street
finally wearily he stops sits his crippled self on the curb
he plunges his fist into his jacket and
straight through the lining james leers silly little pistol at the end of his hand
he considers the pistol then looks up into the sky
gradys pov of the sky
dark and menacing
suddenly a thunderclap shatters the silence
new angle grady
still sitting with the gun in his hand
as if addressing god is that a suggestion
grady sits blinking the snow out of his eyes then two shafts of light dance across his shoes
a white citroen ds appears
grady stares at the car burbling at the curb then lifts himself up and makes his way to the drivers window
sara makes a face bugging her eyes a little mad at him but not without humor
then she rolls down the window
im so glad to see you sara
i believe you
did that nice doctor let you out
or is this you improvising again grady
im through improvising
terry told me about wonder boys
is it true
did you lose it all
i lost it ail
youre such a putz
and youre old
sara strokes his scalp takes a gray hair between her fingers
its very sad
sara smiles at grady but the mischief leaves her eyes when she looks into his and she glances away
i went and looked at some babies just now
trying to make her laugh i guess you have to go on faith
she doesnt some times
grady studies her as she traces her finger around the hospital bracelet still encircling his wrist
did you tell walter
i told walter
does he still love you
it didnt come up
grady studies saras freckled cheeks her anxious profile then turns her chin gently toward him
well i do
ive always loved you sara
i didnt know it at the time but id always been waiting for you
my whole life
because youre who i need
because nothing makes sense without you
because the best moment of every day is the moment i first see your face
and because when you leave a room theres no reason to be in it any more
its just a room again
sara cocks her head
did you just make that up
shaking his head in the hospital
i was kind of excited about it at the time but then i was on pretty heavy painkillers
she frowns good naturedly
grady contd even so
its still true
sara just nods looks away her face unreadable
grady contd sara i promise even though commonsense might tell you
sara turns puts a finger on gradys lips
dont write a page when a paragraph will do
grady nods takes her hand
looks at it as he speaks
you dont deserve me you know
i know but sometimes
sara turns looks at grady
her eyes are glistening
sara contd you just go on faith
grady looks into her eyes then rises and we do too drifting above the streetlights as grady limps to the other side of the car and gets in
as grady snaps shut his door the car drifts off gradually losing itself in the soft veil of falling snow
after a moment grady and sara are lost too nothing more than a blur
