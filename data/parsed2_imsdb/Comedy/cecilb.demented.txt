so once again our top story
sylvia mallory the fifty two year old chairwoman of the maryland heart fund died tonight at union memorial hospital following an on stage heart attack she suffered in the middle
of honey whitlocks kidnapping at tonights baltimore movie premiere
sprocket holes stare in amazement at tv screen the enormity of their act barely sinking in
the teenage gang of cinema terrorists who apparently infiltrated the staff of the senator theater are now eligible for the death penalty in the state of maryland
cecil nods to dinah to turn it off which she does
sprocket holes gulp and look to their leader for guidance
cecil steps forward getting right in honeys terrified face
miss whitlock were going to make our first film and nobodys going to stop us

sprocket holes smile in brain washed enthusiasm
but only the ones willing to dia for it succeed
honey looks into cecils face and lets out a sob of terror
fade in to exterior sprocket house
we hear honey letting out a fresh cry of agony
a dilapidated section of the loft filled with broken mirrors beat up barber chairs filthy hair driers and mangy beauty supplies
honey tied to a barber chair still dressed in her raggedy premiere gown moans in pain as rodney in scary rubber fetish outfit sadistically applies the final batch of double
strength bleach to honeys already shockingly blond hair
raven wearing another witchy black robe and earrings finishes up honeys overly theatrical makeup job
i dont want to be blond
youre going right off the deep end of the clairol color chart
rodney squirts on more dye
its burning my scalp
beauty comes from agony

in the house of pain there are shrines
allistair crowley said that
lets wash it out
rodney yanks honeys head back as raven pours scalding water over her head
screams in pain oh god please
let me go
i wont tell anybody about your little movie
suddenly cecil enters dressed to the nines in another lunatic movie director outfit
he is accompanied by dinah who is even more severely dressed in thrift shop couture carrying a clip board and a stop watch
horrified to see him i mean
you know cult
good morning miss whitlock

nonsense miss whitlock
i wrote the part just for you
hearing helicopter noise outside and smiling and the whole world is watching
ignoring passing police even your agent cant help you now
interior sprocket house wardrobe
work area with piles of stolen clothes spread out in disarray
insane fashion sketches of honey throwing bombs firing guns dressed in terrorist inspired haute couture are tacked to the wall
fidget is vainly trying to rip off security device still attached to fake leopard military jacket
first he tries pulling it off with his teeth then hits it with a hammer to no avail
cecil enters with honey as rodney and raven follow continuing torturing honey by blow drying her hair with malfunctioning smoking hair dryer and curling her eyelashes with rusty curlers
fidget my little genius fidget

interior sprocket house
equipment area next to

i mean is there a dressing room
dinah leans over set wall from above and watches with open lesbian lust
miss whitlock were an a schedule
lewis chardonnay and pam run to peepholes cut in wardrobe walls and watch honey voyeuristically from the other side
honey sees eyeballs staring through peepholes and looks to cecil in sexual fear
to honey ever the dont worry theyre not allowed any form of sexual release
honey nervously starts to unzip her gown
sprocket holes let out an involuntary sexual moan
muttering furious the screen actors guild will hear about this and i mean it
honey lets gown fall to floor and steps out of it
she is wearing beautiful lingerie
starts reaching into his pocket subtly excuse me maam
starts playing pocket pool rodney moans in sexual frustration as honey begins getting dressed in fidgets costume
dinah pants from above as honey slips on tight pants
lewis chardonnay and pam watch from peepholes breathing hard and moaning as honey slips into jacket
petie appears and jealously catches rodney trying to peek down the front of honeys jacket
rodney looks away guiltily
fidget whacks and creates lewdly styling honeys outfit
he then wheels full length mirror to honey and signals to cecil she is ready
honey sees her transformation into terrorist glamour girl for the first time
oh god i look terrible
breaks into sobs cecil and sprocket holes applaud triumphantly
suddenly all business alright lets lock it up
cecil leads honey to set past equipment and lights as sprocket holes scurry to position adjusting lights setting up camera readying props
this is sprocket house miss whitlock think of it as your studio
they arrive at the amazingly inventive exterior set of ritz cinema a tiny guilded movie palace gone to seed
marquee reads pasolini festival
honey stares dumbfounded
cant you say good morning to lewis
he worked hard on this set with a budget of zero
all these materials were stolen from city owned construction sites

lyle enters dressed in hepcat s junkie splendor wear
and her violence prone daughter cherish
cherish enters in eye popping super model goes bad look as honeys eyes light up in horror

advancing on her with hows this for motivation
cecil zaps her painfully with the stun gun
honey twitches in agony and lets out a painful scream
there are no creative differences on a cecil b
demented set miss whitlock
one day youll thank me for saving you from your bad career
to lyle and cherish alright walk through rehearsal
dinah slams the open hand written fetishistically covered script into honeys hands
cherish takes her place in cashiers booth as dinah drags honey inside theater door with lyle to wait for her cue
lyle takes out vial of drugs
want some ecstasy
honey shakes her head negatively in helpless horror
lyle shrugs his shoulders and happily pops the pill into his mouth
cecil moves around stage making cliche directors frame with his hands as pam and chardonnay rehearse camera and sound moves behind him
all the camera equipment has univ of md stenciled on it that has been scratched out half heartedly
entering in character hey cherish its

pasolinis playing and we have an empty theater
dinah pushes honey on stage
reading lines in a monotone its that fucking new multiplex that opened in the mall isnt it
cecils face turns to stone as the rest of the sprocket holes watch shocked at honeys wooden performance
i heard they were sold out last night mom

cecil starts banging his head painfully on cement wall to show his displeasure at honeys reading
still in a monotone somebodys gotta pay for this insult
honey looks out and sees sprocket holes aping cecils self destructive review of her reading dinah slaps her own face lewis staples his own leg rodney jams the sharp end
of a rat tail comb in his ear
this title will be replaced by a more recent critically panned big film hit we can get the rights to
from the empty seats of every good movie theater in america
petie fellates his own gun raven closes eyelash curler on her tongue
we will rise up to take back the screen
fidget sticks a sewing needle under his fingernail
just trying to finish death to those who support mainstream cinema
banging his head on wall harder insanely alright

cecil immediately stops banging his head and sprocket holes return to normal
lyle cherish and honey return to start position as the rest of sprocket holes get ready to film
holds up marker camera rolling
spinning sound boom speed
dinah marks the take
entering in character hey cherish its

cecil silently mouths the dialogue along with honey
from the empty movie seats of every good movie theater in america we will rise to take back the screen

cecil and sprocket holes burst into applause
thats more like it miss whitlock
cherish gives honey a suddenly jealous look
feeling her oats to be frank cecil i would never do this picture in my real film life

hollywood makes the best films in the world and im proud to be part of that system
suddenly the dictator again lets move on
the first take is the only real truth
but you cant cut the film with only a master
there are no rules in outlaw cinema miss whitlock only edges
we believe technique to be nothing more than failed style
you see ive had a vision
all the sprocket holes smile like film zombies to and that vision is called ultimate reality
the rest of our film is shot in real life with real people
and yes with real terror
flip wipe to exterior sprocket house
doors swing open and freshly painted phony fedex truck comes speeding out
lets go back
i hate location work
interior fedex van as it drives through downtown
streets and enters jones falls expressway
petie is behind the wheel as lyle and cherish study their lines in hand written raving beauty script
cecil hurriedly flips through time magazine until he finds the article he wants
rodney and raven torture honey with their constant touchups as pam chardonnay dinah and fidget crowd in the back of van with equipment and guns as lewis reads a copy
of psychotronic magazine
i see a fucking root already
he lunges to honeys scalp with hair dye applicator bottle
im a much better actress in the studio
thats not what time magazine has to say
miss whitlock seems a little ill at ease and past her prime to carry a picture by herself especially one as sappy and overproduced as some kind of happiness
time magazine said that
your pictures gonna lose thirty million dollars
can i ask you a question
did you ever fuck mel gibson
ignoring both petie and lewis cecil give yourself up
its not too late
our film goes into profit the day we sell the first ticket

lyle and cherish leap from van with guns drawn
lyle and cherish chanting in character honey leaps out with gun drawn
in character chanting suddenly out of character this is sq stupid
cecil leaps from van followed by sprocket holes carrying props
aiming his gun at honey say the lines the way theyre written
honey terrified immediately jumps back into character

tasting a handful of popcorn cherish blasts popcorn machine with gun
theater manager comes running down from office
walking right into hey whats the trouble here
cherish glares at a large marketing booth filled with items for sale in lobby
she overturns the booth and items crash to the floor
we are the ultimate bad review
nervous trying to back away please
i didnt make this movie

chardonnay knocks him out cold with one smack of her boom pole
horribly unfunny scene from the flintstones is seen on screen
packed audience howls in laughter
doors to lobby fly open and cecil and his cast and crew come running in tying handkerchiefs around their noses and mouths and filming the action
cecil fires his gun in air
audience turns around in confusion
hissing to honey say the lines
to audience ferociously you dont have to like this movie
taking out a stink bomb lighting another stink bomb lyle cherish and honey lob stink bombs into audience
audience screams in panic as stink bombs go off and tries to run to exits holding their noses and gagging as pam and chardonnay record their every move
cecil smiles in directorial lunacy as one ticket buyer vomits right in front of pams camera
to honey and sprocket holes cecil his cast and crew take off chanting their terrorist yell
fade in to exterior sprocket house
we hear a cool rap song on soundtrack called no budget
when we say action we mean action nobodys putting us in turnaround wild dailies party is in progress
lyle is smoking crack and showing developed footage from that days shoot on the wall of the warehouse as he dances lewdly with himself in place
lewis watches the dailies as he djs from turntables in booth while chardonnay sexily raps the outlaw film call to arms we hear on the soundtrack
petie and rodney torridly go go dance on separate tables as pam and dinah writhe sexily to the beat on the dance floor
cecil and cherish watch the gritty film rushes atop cecils bizarrely decored crane that doubles as their love nest
cecil is frantically trying to write his script but cherish is pawing him turned on by seeing herself on film
come on cecil i want a little action of my own
gently pushing her away im trying to write cherish
honey looking more relaxed with only one leg cuffed to directors chair watches herself on film in the arty grainy but very striking footage
raven does a devil dance with herself and ritualistically drinks from a skull head
goat urine want some
its a satan thing
glancing at honey on film youre really good in our movie
honey beams at compliment catches herself and smiles weakly back at raven as fidget approaches with a martini on a tray for honey
oh craft service
thank you fidget but i never drink when im working but youre very kind
do your parents know where you are tonight
theyre probably mad
dont you think you ought to call them
cecil says our parents are the enemies of film
you know thats nonsense
go ahead call them up
i bet they miss you
lyle ruins everything by staggering over scarily high
hey honey want some crack
i most certainly do not lyle
i cant believe youd be a drug addict in the s its so retro
before i was a drug addict i had so many different problems honey
now i just have one drugs
it gave my life a real focus
cut to cecil on crane with cherish as they hornily watch cherish on film
suddenly riding cecils leg how can you see me on film and not want to fuck me
moaning in sexual frustration i s q want to fuck you cherish but you know i cant
all my directors fuck me
suddenly back in control im not all your directors cherish
lyle begins projecting the dailies on the writhing bodies of the sexually frustrated sprocket holes
grabbing microphone and addressing his followers soldiers of cinema save your sexual energy for the silver screen
sprocket holes break apart and look up to cecil
our footage is stronger than otto premingers
cherish licks cecils tattoo
creepier and darker than david lynchs
lewis scratches a sexual note in the music as he lusts towards chardonnay who sings out a torrid moan
more exploitative than herschel gordon lewis
lyle humps the projector out of his mind
and more violent than sam fuller
dinah writhes in horniness pulls her pistol and fires at the films of david lean coffee table book she uses as a target
we will rise above our raging hormones to a new level of cinema unrest
cut to fidget sneakily dialing parents on phone as honey nods her support
do whatever it takes to avoid sexual release
get as drunk as sam peckinpah
pam guzzles whisky
as high as rainer werner fassbinder
lyle sniffs fumes from an aerosol can of metallic paint
but stay celibate for celluloid
cut back to fidget on phone
we see his suburban mom answer on split screen
mom its me fidget
oh god where are you fidget
are you okay
the movies going great mom
youre wanted for murder
cut back to cecil whc is building to a climax of brainwashing
feel the black humor of almodovar
rodney dances a wild s m step and tries to look petie in the eyes
the satanic fury of kenneth anger
raven possessed by the devil rolls her eyes back in devil horniness
the racial tension of spike lee
chardonnay lets out a soulful wail as she dances in sexual abandon
spotting fidget on the phone and giving him the and the unashamed exhibitionism of william castle
fidget freezes and looks down at william castles name tattooed on his arm
still on phone hello
fidget talk to me
well come and get you
tell us where you are
fidget hangs up phone and starts playing pocket pool frantically
honey sighs and shakes her head in disappointment
sneaking a peak at vibe magazine before blurting out to cecil if we cant have sex cant we at least make money
scared but giving it her best shot yeah lewis thinks i could have a hit record
im a prophet against profit
and you should refuse to sully your artistic vision with financial success
wide eyed to all lewis and chardonnay give up quickly and join the other sprocket holes as they fall to their knees in cult worship
honey signals to fidget shes changed her mind shell have the martini after all
oh andy warhol we worship you from the new cinema underground
oh andy warhol we worship you from the new cinema underground
honey guzzles down the martini
cherish prays the hardest still sexually aroused
help us to use our sexual frustrations as you did for the future of outlaw film
honey watches a little tipsy
honey absentmindedly joins in as she stares at herself in rushes looking quite stellar as cherish eyes her jealously
immediate black out
slow fade in to exterior sprocket house
cut to interior sprocket house
sprocket holes are passed out all over loft surrounded by rotting junk food empty liquor bottles and last nights party debris
cecil and cherish lie asleep twisted and entwined in the sheets tortured by their erotic dreams
suddenly one of cecils bloodshot eyes open and he lurches for the microphone
in a booming voice to all the sprocket holes hey kids
lets make a mother fucking movie
he hits hideously loud alarm button
sprocket holes leap to their feet and stagger into film production
before she can barely open her eyes honey sees rodney and raven rushing towards her their instruments of beauty torture ready
glaring at honeys hair i see that fucking brown color

rodney sadistically squirts her roots with dye as honey lets out a cry of agony
just close your eyes and think of the films of george cukor
raven tweezes honeys eyebrows painfully as rodney continues to torture her hair
trying a new tactic raven youre a pretty girl you could escape this madness

rodney rips out a clump of honeys teased hair with brush
oh god stop
no one chooses to be heterosexual

in a rage he blasts the blow drier on finished hairdo and flames singe her neck
cecil enters now dressed in an even more elaborate cecil b
demille inspired movie director outfit
petie acting as bodyguard leers at rodney who lets out one final sob of frustration as dinah changed into another alarming retro fashion number wheels in her portable tv monitor
good morning miss whitlock

cecil nods to dinah to start tape and we see a teenage boy on news in front of vandalized timonium theater
i was in the audience when they attacked and ill tell you

honey looks in confusion to cecil who smiles proudly back
tape jumps to a different news show showing teen girl wearing a handmade cecil rules t shirt
she stands out front of the popular local art house the charles theater

honey catches herself half smiling at the favorable mention
tape cuts to timonium theater manager his head now bandaged
nobody forced her to be in that movie i could see that but she was damn good
scarier than hell if you ask me

honeys face lights up but cecil quickly brings her down to earth
there are still some people who dont understand our work
dinah zaps on tv and we see middle aged man in suit behind podium at press conference
subtitle identifies him as maryland film commissioner
