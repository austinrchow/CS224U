screenplay by tom dicillo a battered mm movie camera stands alone on a wooden tripod surrounded by blackness
opening credits begin
an almost imperceptible dolly in toward the movie camera
the dolly forward continues throughout the credits ending in an extreme cu of the cameras lens filling the frame like a giant glass full moon
fade to black
suddenly a door opens directly in front of the camera wiping the lens and revealing the following scene in black and white
a quiet deserted industrial street
it is over an hour before dawn and the street is still cloaked in the heavy stillness of night
in the weak light filtering out of their battered van bert and cybil the craft service managers finish setting out breakfast supplies on a table
they work in almost complete silence both nearly paralyzed with sleep
a cheap walkie talkie lying beside a paper plate of soggy oreos sputters and buzzes occasionally
other items on the table include a mangled banana seven grapes and a box of chocolate covered donuts
what time is it
this milk is bad
sniffs when did you buy it
i dont know
pause theres a deli on broadway
nothing thats open
sniffs the milk is it that bad
i dont know
youre the one who said it was bad
at that moment a large truck grinds around the corner and shudders to a stop in front of the building
bert replaces the carton of milk neatly beside the orange juice
amid low one word greetings the crew tumbles out of the trucks and stands in a groggy cluster around the craft service table
wolf the cameraman assumes a place of prominence
he wears a black leather coat a black beret and black leather half fingered gloves
this is the worst fucking coffee ive had in my life
then dont drink it
whatre we doing today
pulls out a wrinkled callsheet interior
ellen talks to mom
yeah you have to take your fucking pants off
ill do it
i like ellen
yeah shes a babe
she was the nurse in that richard gere movie
i worked on that
the shower scene
start with the k in the window
run feeders for three blonds into the living room
who fuckin knows
walks off ellen talks to mom
nicole sits quietly in the back seat of a beat up station wagon
she glances out at the empty city moving past her window and lets out a deep sigh
jeff the young intern assigned as her driver glances into the rearview mirror
no ive been up since four
ive got a big scene today and im kind of nervous
ellen talks to mom
have you read the script
its on the callsheet
well its pretty emotional
i tell my mother i never felt she really loved me
youre going to yell at each other
i dont know
im just going to go with how i feel
which is the scary part
im very close to this character
problems with your own mom
but she died before i well before we could reconcile
you were great in that richard gere movie
a pair of womens orthopedic shoes enter the frame and begin pacing
camera pans up to reveal cora a small woman in her early s pacing beneath the awning of her residential hotel
she appears to be rehearsing dialogue with herself
ellen i have no memory of this whatsoever
ellen i have no memory of this whatsoever
jeff pulls the car up to the curb and cora gets into the back seat
good morning mom
not a wink
cora immediately lights a cigarette
nicole instinctively wrinkles her nose and turns away
cora notices this and makes an exaggerated effort to keep the smoke away from nicole by blowing it hard out the side of her mouth
jeff glances back at the two women in the rearview mirror
no one speaks
nick the director wolf the cameraman and wanda the ad stand in a loose triangle on the darkened set
all are holding coffee cups
the gaffer can be seen in the background fumbling with a light
look im not blaming anybody wanda
im just saying we left last night and i knew we didnt get that scene
im sorry i thought it was a great scene nick
it was ok and its going to be alright
but im not settling for ok today
this is a big scene and im not leaving till we get it
whatever it takes nick
were here for you
alright heres what im thinking
wolf i want to do the whole scene in one shot
its been done
i know that but id like to try it anyway
we go from close up to wide shot and back to close up in the same shot
ill use the minimize distortion ill light it all from the ceiling
it could be kind of great
how long wolf
ill need to see a couple run throughs
not too many
its a tough scene for the actors
i want them to feel relaxed fresh
weve got all day nick
whatever it takes
what do you think wolf an hour
i dont know how you drink that shit black nick
i got to dump in the milk
its the only way i can cut the taste
suddenly the gaffer turns on the k flooding the room with harsh blinding light
what the fuck
flame on asshole
the screen goes completely white
screen is still white
gradually it shifts back to proper exposure revealing nicole in medium cu
her eyes are riveting it is obvious she is emotionally primed for the scene
a light meter is thrust in front of her face
she barely registers it
ws the entire living room set
nicole sits on a sofa facing cora seated opposite in an overstuffed chair
two flats have been joined at right angles to create the living room corner
a table lamp and assorted framed photographs complete the rather scrawny looking set
most of the movie crew is seen including wolf looking through the camera
ok pictures up
stop the work
lock it up
going for picture
nick approaches nicole and cora
ok nice and easy
cora youre doing fine
remember really listen and really answer
smiles at nicole ive got nothing to say to you
just let it happen
its all there
look at this a second nick
nick moves behind the camera and looks through the eyepiece
another cu of nicole fills the frame
the image is visually and emotionally breathtaking
i pushed in a foot
its coming right through the lens
nick grips wolfs shoulder in gratitude
thats great man
and roll sound
and roll camera
scene six take one
hits the sticks action
from the moment nick calls action the film will cut directly to the shot the set camera is filming
the shot is fluid graceful and in richly beautiful color
nicoles performance is very strong flawed only slightly by her nervousness
dad hit me first and knocked me down
it didnt hurt that much but i started crying anyway hoping he would leave me alone
he went over and started hitting danny
ellen i have no memory of this whatsoever
you were just standing there looking at me
then you pulled me up and said youre not hurt
like i was disgusting for faking for doing the only thing i could think of to keep him from hitting me again
i was worried about danny
you do remember
he was smaller than you
nicole turns to cora with the heartbreaking gaze of an abandoned child
nick and the rest of the crew watch in awe
you were so worried about danny suddenly the boom dips all the way into the shot
sorry i had to cut
les your boom was all the way in the shot
well wheres the frame line
all the crew move around all talking at once
ok can we get a frame line
hold it down
were going again right away
les you got the frame line
i guess so
ok here we go
nick approaches nicole and cora
beautiful both of you
stay with it
no big deal
lets go wanda
scene six take two
hits the sticks and action
dad hit me first and knocked me down
it didnt hurt that much but i started crying anyway hoping he would leave me alone
he went over and started hitting danny
ellen i the image suddenly goes out of focus
im sorry i have to cut
i was completely off on the focus
its my fault im sorry
thanks for the apology but youll never work in this town again
laughter ive got it now
here we go right away
lock it up
and roll sound
scene six take three
hits the sticks and action
the scene begins once again
remarkably nicoles enormous commitment is just as full and sharp
nick is in ecstasy
dad hit me first and knocked me down
it didnt hurt that much but i started crying anyway hoping he would leave me alone
he went over and started hitting danny
ellen i have no memory of this whatsoever
suddenly a car stops right outside a heavy bass driven rap song blasting out of its trunk mounted speakers
thats a cut
into her walkie what the fucks going on down there
you call that a lock up
get that car out of there
why doesnt the guy just get a flatbed trailer with about speakers on it and tow it behind his car
everyone nods in annoyed agreement everyone except the boom man who appears to be following the music with the mike bopping to it through the headphones
slowly interminably the music fades off into the distance
into her walkie do i have a lock up
is that a real lock up
ok right away
and roll camera
scene six take four
hits the sticks action
dad hit me first and knocked me down
it didnt hurt that much but i started crying anyway hoping he would leave me alone
he went over and started hitting danny
ellen i have no memory of this whatsoever
you were just standing there looking at me
then you pulled suddenly the boom drops into frame again
the whole left side of frame les
alright can we please get a motherfucking frame line please
the frame keeps changing
thats the idea les
may i make a suggestion
is it possible to maybe break the shot down
maybe two shots instead
might make it easier for les
then i need ten minutes to switch to radio mikes
your call nick
there wont be any other sound problems
no more boom problems
switch to radios
thats a ten minute break
release the lock up
to the ac get me a coffee
nick looks for nicole but sees only cora standing by the couch
les has both arms up the back of her dress running the wire to her radio mike
shes wearing stockings rolled down to just above her knees
nick turns and spots nicole by herself in a dark corner of the set and walks over to her
im sorry about all this nicole
its not your fault nick
is there a way to use some of the earlier takes
not unless i change the shot do a cutaway of cora or something and intercut the takes
i dont want to do that
its a really nice shot and what youre doing is incredible
the radio mikes are going to make everything easier
take a moment
let all this shit go
we dont roll till youre ready
nick moves back to the set leaving nicole in the shadows
camera stays on her as she begins emotionally preparing herself once again
how was she in that richard gere movie
camera slips halfway through an open bedroom door holding nicole on one side of the frame while revealing pam the script supervisor and cybil sitting on the floor smoking
though separated by the wall nicole hears everything the two women say
her career really took off didnt it
i saw her in a michael bolton video
she is nice but i could do a better job
camera slips into a cu of nicole
she closes her eyes as the two women continue talking about her
screen goes black
a black scrim held by the gaffer passes in front of the camera revealing the set with nicole and cora settling in for a take
wheres that flag going
its a scrim
two seconds wanda
no more tweaking
into her walkie lock it up
wolf quickly motions gaffer to hand hold the scrim in front of the k
and roll sound
scene six take five
hits the sticks action
once again the scene begins
nicole shows the first signs of losing her concentration
dad hit me first and knocked me down
it didnt hurt that much but i started crying anyway hoping he would leave me alone
he went over and started hitting danny
ellen i have no memory suddenly there is a tremendous explosion sending bits of glass flying through the frame
cora jumps clutching her chest
cu the light the gaffer had been holding the scrim before
it is smoking and shattered
jesus fucking christ
to the gaffer kill it
pull the plug
right there by your foot
thats a cut
cora are you alright
cora nods wordlessly gasping for breath
lets get a broom up here right away
clear the set
nick cora and nicole stand in a corner of the landing
nick is making obvious attempts to lighten the mood
well lets see
what do you think is going to happen next cora
im going to have a heart attack
no youre not
youre going in there in two minutes and we are really going to nail this scene
i know it
i have no doubt about it
nick turns to nicole and stops in midsentence
he looks at her for a long moment
nicole returns his gaze then suddenly looks away
nick hesitates a moment then rushes back to the set
ill tell you this much right now i am never ever doing another fucking low budget movie
nick joins wanda and wolf on the set couch and chair
wolf and i were talking
ellens losing it a little bit
you got three quarters of the scene really really incredible in the first take
do a quick cut away and all you need is a pickup of the last part of the scene
you know how i feel i love this shot
hell i designed it
then lets just stick with the game plan ok
its a simple shot
were going to get it this time i feel it
were here for you nick
whatever it takes
nick moves off
wanda stares at wolf who studiously inspects his light meter
camera is close on the black and white clapboard
nicoles face can be partially seen behind it
and roll sound
and roll camera
scene six take six
hits the sticks action
as the scene begins again it is obvious that both actresses are completely distracted
nicks face betrays a rapidly increasing anxiety
dad hit me first and knocked me down
it didnt hurt that much but i started crying anyway hoping he would leave me alone
he went over and started hitting danny
there is a long awkward pause as cora realizes she cant remember her line
thats ok cora
whats the line
just say it to me no acting
pause ellen i have no memory of this line whatsoever
amid general tittering from the crew wanda yells out
ok could we get the line please
pam ellen i have no memory of this whatsoever
and roll sound
and roll camera
scene six take seven
hits the sticks action
the scene begins again
nicole is lifeless shes merely saying the lines
dad hit me first and knocked me down
it didnt hurt that much but i started crying anyway i was worried about danny
nicole stops cold completely thrown by cora jumping her line
im sorry im lost
no big deal
nicks voice has the rigid tremble of someone barely able to keep from screaming
were just going to run the lines
just run the lines
then were going to shoot this fucking scene
nicole gets up quietly and sits next to cora on the couch wordlessly taking her hand in hers
whispers im so sorry
im fucking this up for you
whispers cora dont even think that
youre doing great
im the one whos fucking it up
if i get through this i swear im never acting again
she means it
cora glances up at her seeing for the first time how pain and defeat have drawn the life from nicoles face
on an impulse cora reaches out and gently lifts a strand of nicoles hair from her eyes
a sudden amazed alarm fills nicole
the living room grows strangely quiet
faintly from a distance and action on the run through
she looks quickly toward nick in confusion
dissolve to a nurse moving quickly past the camera and out the open door of the hospital room
cu nicole seated on the edge of the hospital bed
still confused she looks down at the old woman lying in the bed
the womans face is pale and drawn
as nicole leans closer her mother reaches out and gently brushes a strand of hair away from her face
the gesture is one of love acceptance and farewell
it is identical to the one we have just seen cora make to her
and action on the run through
ws the living room set
nick wanda the rest of the crew standing quietly
nicole glances over at cora and instantly something unspoken and unexplained passes between them
the run through begins
from the moment nicole opens her mouth it is obvious there has been a remarkable change in her
every word now has the stunning clarity of truth
cora is completely engulfed in the moment
dad hit me first and knocked me down
it didnt hurt that much but i started crying anyway hoping he would leave me alone
he went over and started hitting danny
ellen i have no memory of this whatsoever
you were just standing there looking at me
as nicole continues one by one the crew turn and watch this exquisite moment happening before them
nicks face is lit with rapture
whispering roll camera
he glances over and to his horror sees that no one is behind the camera
he whispers frantically to the ac
whispers in the bathroom
he doesnt feel good
whispers get him
nick turns back to the scene watching its beauty now in agony
then you pulled me up and said youre not hurt
like i was disgusting for faking for doing the only thing i could think of to keep him from hitting me again
i was worried about danny
you do remember
he was smaller than you
you were so worried about danny
what about me mom
why werent you worried about me
there is a heavy stunned silence as the scene ends
nicole and cora are in each others arms
pam and cybil share a piece of tissue
cut to an extreme cu of nick
where the fuck is wolf
in the cramped confines of the dingy basement bathroom wolf pukes violently into the toilet
his face is pale and slick with perspiration
his eyes look upward toward the sound of nick yelling
wolf tries to continue but another spasm of nausea wrenches him back toward the toilet bowl
the set is quiet subdued
nick sits on the couch with nicole and cora
wolf sits groggily behind the camera wiping the sweat from his face
wanda addresses the crew
ok listen up
nobody drinks the milk downstairs
it appears to be bad
nick speaks uneasily to nicole and cora
he is a wreck and his insistent smile of encouragement looks absolutely demented
ive had to well ive changed the shot were just a little pressed for time
itll just be a cu of ellen for the last part of the scene starting with coras i was worried about danny
ill find a way to cut this into the fourth take
we almost had it
that was unbelievable both of you
but lets not think about it
that moment is gone and
well well get another one
i have no doubt about it
here we go
nick walks over and stands beside the camera
im ready nick
nick is so angry he cant even look at wolf
call it wanda
and roll sound
and roll camera
scene six pickup take one
hits the sticks action
the scene begins at the pickup point
miraculously both cora and nicole are just as concentrated and engaged as they were in the run through
i was worried about danny
you do remember
he was smaller than you
you were so worried about danny
what about me mom
why werent in the middle of this final delicate moment an insistent electronic beeping is heard
what the fuck is that
frantically checking his equipment its not me
its the camera
the fuck it is
its off its not even running
the beep continues growing louder
into her walkie whats going on down there
do i have a lock up
you dont hear a beeping sound
to nick the streets quiet
then what the fuck is it
its somebodys watch
everybody holds their watches up to their ears
and so on until all watches have been checked with negative results
the beeping continues growing louder and louder
suddenly nick loses it
he starts running around the set ripping things apart knocking over tables lamps chairs
he shoves cora off the couch and whips off the cushions heaving them against the wall with a startling violence
where is it
you cock sucking motherfucking bastard
where the fuck are you
everyone watches nick demolish the set in stunned open mouthed amazement
nick turns to the crew in rage
can someone help me please
do i have to do everything myself here
nick loses it completely
why dont you go learn your lines
hey scriptgirl are you finally going to pay attention here
hey focus puller you want to make a movie or get stoned
huh i got some great fuckin thai stick here
hey wolf you pretentious beret wearing motherfucker
i saw your reel man it sucked
who the hell would hire you anyway
hey wanda next time can you wear a shirt thats a little more distracting to my actors
to the gaffer hey bob
can you please make a little more noise on the dolly you creaky motherfucker
to cybil what is your name
what do you fucking do around here
to the soundman hey speedo whats the matter
cant even find a teeny fucking beep
cu of nicole
she turns away unable to watch anymore
the beeping continues
see what i have to put up with nicole
maybe next time youll do some of that magic on camera
but no no wait till wolf is puking his guts out oh now ill be good
ws the entire room
nicks last word echoes throughout the silent set
suddenly he stops in the center of the demolished set and lets out a long wrenching scream
quick cut to extreme cu nicks face just as his eyes open
the film is in color now
the room is in heavy darkness except for the light on nicks face
nick reaches over and shuts off his clock radio
the digital dial shows a
the beeping finally stops
nick turns on a light and sits up in bed drenched in sweat and still breathing heavily
this is not a sigh of relief the camera dollies swiftly back away from nick
he stares at it in stunned amazement
just then a door closes right into the lens turning the frame into complete blackness
out of the blackness a door opens away from the camera revealing wanda looking into her closet the camera is inside the closet
from this point on the rest of the film is in color except where specifically indicated to be black and white
she is wearing only a bra black stretch pants and cowboy boots
she rummages quickly through some blouses selects the same garish one she wore in part one then walks away revealing wolf sitting on the edge of the rumpled bed
he is dressed exactly the same as when we last saw him complete with beret
he struggles groggily into his socks and boots
the entire apartment is in disarray
a bedside clock reads well when did he ask you
yesterday when i was helping him check into his hotel
what the guy cant even check into a hotel by himself
listen wolf having chad palomino in this movie will benefit us all
if being there when he checks into his hotel makes him feel better then im happy to do it
well how did it come up
he asked me if i liked jazz i said yes and he suggested we meet tonight at a jazz club
i like jazz
he did not invite you
applies perfume why are you wearing perfume to work
because i feel like it
you didnt wear it yesterday
oh stop it
youre acting like a child
wanda playfully swipes at wolfs face with a negligee she is returning to the closet
it misses him completely
sweetheart are you alright
do i look alright
let me see
christ were going to be late
wanda sits and perfunctorily examines wolfs eye
the car is parked outside a rather seedy hotel
jeff the intern and nick the director sit quietly in the motionless car
should we call up to the room again
he said hed be right down
nick lets out a huge yawn
i dreamt i was on the set all night
i was just trying to do one shot and everything kept going wrong
thats an anxiety dream
are you anxious about something
i dont know
sometimes i wonder what the hell im doing in this business
its all just one compromise and disappointment after another
i dont know if i have the personality for it
sounds kind of like an identity crisis
maybe youre right
who am i
what am i really capable of
maybe i should just get a job teaching at a womens college somewhere
howd you get into cinematography
im not a cinematographer
im directing this movie
pause howd you get into directing
in the dim light of the hotel room chad palomino dresses quickly
he is young handsome with long blond hair
a woman sits nude on the bed her back to the camera
the faint sound of a shower comes from the adjacent bathroom
theyre waiting downstairs
go ahead ill take a taxi
listen ive got to tell you i had a lot of fun last night really but for me where im at right now in my life a relationship is
chad hold it
this was a one time deal
you know it i know it
there is no need for melodrama
i just thought you might
look all i ask is that you dont mention this to anyone
hey thats not my style
so ill see you on the set
palomino slips out the door
the woman falls back onto the bed turning her face toward the camera
we see it is nicole
god damn it
she lies for a moment listening to the sound of the shower
the bedside clock reads a
the car pulls up outside a nyc apt building
jeff nick and palomino sit inside
i got two films coming up right after yours nick
one i play a rapist that michelle pfeiffer falls in love with
the other im kind of a sexy serial killer who shacks up with winona ryder

big laugh see what i mean
hey what are we sitting here for
were waiting for nicole
shes takin a tax he stops what
probably taking a shower or something
hey how was her shower scene in that richard gere movie
the three men sit in silence
ws showing the car parked outside nicoles apt the men inside waiting
a small elegant bedroom set has been constructed in the middle of the huge empty space
one wall has a fake window
the gaffer lies on the bed staring absently at the ac sitting motionless beside the camera a few feet away
neither speaks for a long moment
i think we got nudity today
reads from his callsheet it just says scene six ellen and damian kiss
could be a kiss with nudity
i like ellen
shes my type
why is that
kind of kooky
maybe ill give her a part
thats right im makin my own movie pretty soon
i brought my script
the gaffer tugs a thin tattered script folded lengthwise out of his back pocket
palominos perfect for the lead
im going to give it to him right during lunch
maybe right after
got to be aggressive
you want to shoot it
you ever shot anything
thats alright got to start somewhere
suddenly the gaffer reaches out and warmly shakes the acs hand
nicole sits before the makeup mirror
lorde the male makeup artist picks up a tube of preparation h and begins applying it under nicoles eyes just as nick walks up
jesus what are you doing
thats what this stuff is for
let that sit for two minutes pumpkin ill be right back
howd you get here
took a taxi
weve been waiting in front of your apartment for half an hour
god im sorry nick
something came up
i forgot to call
im sorry i feel like such an asshole
youre just saying that because you have preparation h on your face
i never should have gone out last night
i hate jazz
god i look terrible
no you dont
dont bullshit me nick
you really look beautiful
something in nicks voice makes nicole glance up at him
he looks away quickly
the moment is awkward as if they both realize he has inadvertently revealed something
just then palomino approaches
howd you get here nicole
i took a cab
oh cause we were wondering how you got here
nick looks at both of them in a moment of silence
alright good everybodys here
well do a run through as soon as you guys are ready
you got it chief
lorde reenters as nick leaves
palomino sits in the chair beside nicole and lorde immediately begins his makeup
no one speaks
the crew is assembled behind the camera
wolf is now wearing a black eyepatch over one eye
nick is on the set talking with nicole and palomino
palomino wears a tuxedo and nicole is in an elaborate low cut gown
hold it down hold it down people
great shirt wanda
big smile why thank you chad
ok lets work out the rest of this blocking
wolf notices wolfs eyepatch what happened to your eye
a little accident

nicole is standing here chad youre there by the chair
camera is close on ellen her first line
ive always admired you from afar
that sounds rather professional
professional thats the cue damian steps up to the bed
camera pulls back
the scene continues

it sounds like the champagne talking
ive loved you from the moment we met
why didnt you tell me
we were working together
i didnt want anything to interfere

it sounds like the champagne talking
ive loved you from the moment we met
finally moves to his mark why didnt you tell me

palomino and nicole embrace
their kiss like the entire scene is flat lifeless and awful
not for camera
chad was completely out of frame
yeah chad what happened buddy

i held back
it really felt like something damian would do holding back to the last moment
oh i see

nick approaches the bed and speaks quietly to chad and nicole
chad how would you describe this scene in one word

it sounds like the champagne talking
ive loved you from the moment we met
why didnt you tell me
we were working together
i didnt want anything to interfere
and all this time i thought
the scene once again is awful
nick gives their listless kiss a few moments then calls cut
chad missed his cue again the whole dolly is unusable
what happened i thought you were going to hold back till me
the more i thought about it the more it didnt seem right
and im thinking watch me here instead of coming around the bed what if i just slip here like this and do the whole scene lying down
i dont know that seems a little
hey im just throwing out ideas here
trying to get the juices flowing
nicole how does that feel to you
well i can turn to look at him
but wont you be shooting the back of my head
plus chad is completely out of the light down there
hey wolf im not worried about my face man

i think we can afford a few minutes to set a light for mr
good lets do it
ellen damian lets talk for a second
as nick nicole and palomino step off the set wanda speaks to the crew in general
well pause to set this light and go again right away
how long wolf
wolf doesnt answer though he stands a mere foot away watching the gaffer set up a light
wolf walks away from wanda without a word
the entire crew watches this
nick palomino and nicole confer all three smoking
ok lets make sure we know whats going on here
these two people have loved each other for years each of them not knowing the other was in love with them
and tonight in this little room it all comes out

i know im sorry
but this feels really awkward turning all the way around like this
yeah i think the lying on the bed is not quite working chad
lets try one with the original blocking
which one was that
theres been so many damn changes
could somebody help me out please
the cue for the original blocking is professional
intimate thank you
thank you very much
ok right away
call it wanda
could i just have a moment
is that alright
of course nicole are you kidding
hold the roll wanda
holding the roll
nicole remains seated on the bed lowering her head and closing her eyes as she attempts to generate some emotion for the scene
everyone watches her in complete silence
palomino tiptoes over to the camera where wanda and the scriptgirl are standing side by side
as he leans between them checking his lines on the scriptgirls script he inhales deeply then exhales with a barely audible sigh
whispers someone over here smells very very nice
thinking he means her wandas lips flutter in a brief involuntary smile
meanwhile the scriptgirl turns away blushing furiously
palomino tiptoes again back to his spot
nicole raises her head and nods once to nick
she seems to have aroused some real emotion in herself
with quiet intensity call it wanda
and roll sound
scene six take four
suddenly nick i just had a great idea
hold the roll
what is it chad
just stop me if im out of line here but she says admired from afar right
doesnt it make sense to see damian up close and her afar
you start on a close up of damian watch me here as she declares her love the camera moves with me into this primo two shot that you and the
wolfmeister have set up here
what do you think wolf
i dont like it
this is ellens scene
i dont know it sort of makes sense
hey you did it man
its all there in the writing
id have to relight
nick pauses thinking hard
were still ahead of schedule nick if that means anything to you
lets do it
to the gaffer get me a tweenie right here with diffusion
ok everyone stand by
were pausing briefly to set one little light then were going again right away
stand in please for mr
ill do it
get the fucking light
several members of the crew loiter around the table
the scriptgirl approaches carrying a donut in one hand and a cup of coffee in the other
palomino notices her and moves quietly to her side
without a word he picks up the milk and pours some in her coffee
nicole stands nearby and watches the following exchange
just a bit
palomino puts sugar in her coffee with extreme care
you like jazz
maybe we could go hear some tonight
palomino smiles and moves away just as wanda comes up for a coffee refill
its going well i think
dont you think
what time do you think well finish
early i hope
im going to a jazz club tonight
so am i
hes wonderful isnt he
hes so natural like
i wonder what his sign is
do you know nicole
i dont know his sign but i think his moon is in uranus
wanda chokes hard on her coffee as nicole walks off with a bitter smile
you dont have to be nasty
palomino saunters onto the set as wolf and his crew finish relighting
is this my new mark
until you change it
wheres my fucking eyepatch
wolf walks off
the gaffer slips the ac a shrewd wink then walks over and stands next to palomino giving him a big friendly grin
hey whatya say
im lighting this show
chad palomino actor
big smile i know
to the ac hey whats your name
hey maurice chevalier
hey smoking crew guys really
the gaffer slips his own script out of his back pocket and begins leafing through it
hey thanks chad
actually i wrote a script
palomino takes the gaffers script and holds it up to his eyes shading them from a light hes looking at across the room
he points to the light
see that light over there
lower it about three feet
palomino hands the gaffer back his script and walks off
the gaffer and ac stand in silence for a long awkward moment
nick intently scrutinizes himself in the mirror
leaning closer he makes a careful adjustment to the way his hair falls over his ear then steps back to examine himself
would you care to have a drink tonight
hey nicole what do you say you and i have a drink tonight
suddenly the door opens behind him and nicole walks in
thats ok no problem
im just slapping a little water on my face
the two stand in embarrassed silence for a moment
nick looks like hes gathering the nerve to ask her out
so its going pretty good huh
something feels off
yeah you seem a little tense
but dont worry about it
just take your attention off yourself and put it on chad
work off him a little more
ok ill try that
and listen i know hes no olivier
but hes got something dont you think
kind of a natural presence
oh yes hes very natural
nick hesitates again gathering his nerves to pop the question
anything else i can help you with
actually there is
could you maybe ask him to brush his teeth
wanda crosses the set and assumes her position beside the camera
wolf sits behind it barely a foot away
my eye is killing me
put your eyepatch on
i lost it
is that little light set yet
that little light was set ten minutes ago
into her walkie get me the a team in here right away
nick nicole and mr
to wolf why didnt you tell me
hey youre not worried about the time im not worried about the time
oh i am very worried about the time
i know you are
what is that supposed to mean
what do you think it means
i dont know what it means
oh yes you do you know exactly what it means
i have no idea what youre talking about
why are you you dont understand me wanda
you have no idea i dont understand you
all i do is take care of you
nick suddenly runs up just as wolf and wanda are on the verge of blows
hey hey hey
what the hells going on here
this is a very intimate scene and a lot of tension on the set doesnt help
now wolf lets just go through the first part of the move
damian on your new mark
close up damian ellen in the background
nick suddenly sees palomino is wearing a black eyepatch
chad what are you doing
hey thats my fucking eyepatch
wolf could i borrow it
cause im telling you nick it really feels right
i feel like this guy now man
i dont know chad
i dont think it works
youre wrong man
im going to fight you on this one
hey its my fucking eyepatch and i dont want anyone wearing it
palomino removes the eyepatch and tosses it back to wolf
ill get my own
nick send someone out for an eyepatch
ill fucking pay for it myself
nick pulls palomino aside and whispers to him confidentially
i didnt want to say this in front of wolf but it makes you look a little
yeah a little bit
palomino sneaks a glance back at wolf then whispers to nick
are you ready nick
you need a rehearsal wolf
lets just fucking shoot it
palomino winks at nick and walks back to his new mark making a barely audible howling sound behind his hand
call it wanda
going for picture
lock it up
and roll sound
scene six take four
the scene begins again
palomino milks his close up for all its worth
ive always admired you from afar
that sounds rather professional
well then loved
how does that sound
right on his cue palomino walks to the bed
as the camera moves into the shot he begins stroking nicoles hair with extreme care and concentration
it sounds like the champagne talking
ive loved you from the moment we met
why didnt you tell me
we were working together
i didnt want anything to interfere god
under the onslaught of escalating hair stroking nicole suddenly jerks her head away hard
palomino jumps up and begins pacing at the rear of the set
thats a cut
hold the work going again right away
im sorry nick
i dont know why i did that
palomino suddenly stops pacing and addresses nick with a curtness that is a little startling
nick could i talk to you a second
palomino disappears behind the set a jerk of his head indicating his wish for nick to follow him
a momentary delay
everyone stand by
were going again right away
excuse me ellen
you were a tad low on that take
ill bring it up
actually could i listen to the take before
the sound man gives nicole his headphones and rewinds the tape recorder for her
the first several lines of the last take are heard through the headphones
nick follows palomino behind the set stopping just beside the fake set window
palomino whirls on nick and whispers fiercely
im out of here man
whats the matter
i like you but i made a big mistake taking this part
have someone call me a cab
wait a second chad
just talk to me
whats going on
i cant act with this woman
i know shes a friend of yours but i got to tell you she cannot act worth a shit
im giving her everything
the whole thing i just did with the hair did you see that
i came up with that on my own because i thought it would help her
but no shes giving me nothing
im out of here
nicole listens to the last line of the previous take
god and all this time i thought
the muted rustle of the kiss the sound man stops the recorder at the end of the take sets the machine in standby mode and picks up his crossword puzzle
nicole is just about to take off the headphones when she realizes she can hear nick and palomino talking quite clearly
glancing up she sees the boom man has left his boom leaning against the wall the mike pointing out the open set window
why did you cast her
she sucked in that richard gere movie
she is not the best actress in the world
i see that now but youve got to help me chad
im asking you to please help me here
weve got to get through this somehow
the camera begins a slow dolly in to nicoles astonished face
this will be intercut with a similar dolly in to the microphone leaning against the wall ending in an ecu of the mike
camera is close on nick and palomino
ill tell you what this is about man
you know why she took a cab this morning
something came up
she was in my hotel room and she didnt want you to know it
im sorry it had to come out like this but i told her this morning thanks a lot it was a lot of fun last night but lets get something
straight it was just a one time deal and she didnt want to hear that
she wanted more you see what im saying
the camera reveals nicole now seated in her spot on the bed
she rises as nick and palomino reappear and approach her from behind the set
nick its my fault the scene isnt working
chad i apologize to you too
im completely unfocused here and i think youre absolutely right what we need to do is loosen the scene up somehow
nick and palomino stare at nicole for a moment
what would you like to do
i was wondering if we could try improvising the scene
more along the lines of what chad has been doing
maybe that would help me find something
nicks smile of gratitude to nicole looks almost drug induced
thats a fantastic idea
what do you think chad
hey thats the only way i can work
lets take it apart lets cut loose
and well shoot it
hell why not
roll that motherfucking camera wolfie
kiss my ass
although wolf says this quite loud palomino doesnt hear him because he suddenly yells yeah
alright now were making a fucking movie
call it wanda
going for picture
lock it up
and roll sound
scene six take five
nicole stays seated though palomino moves around making a great show of loosening up
ive always admired you from afar
thats wow thats incredible
but that sounds kind of professional doesnt it
how does despised sound
laughs whats it mean
laughs its sort of like i think youre a piece of shit
palomino is somewhat startled by this
he looks to nick in confusion
nick silently encourages him to keep going
another laugh that sounds like the champagne talking
i really do think you are a piece of shit
no you dont
you love me
the fuck i do
i cant stand looking at you
then i guess i have nothing else to say
no i think you have a lot more to say damian
well i am surprised you feel this way ellen
i always thought you admired thats not what i meant
you should tell everyone what you just told nick behind the set
hey this isnt part of the scene
say it anyway the reason this scene isnt working is because you and i slept together last night
did everyone hear that
i fucked chad last night
nick and the rest of the crew stand in stunned amazement
i told you this was about rejection
you fucking scumbag
you think i give a rats ass about you
i was there to get laid and even that was a joke
you know you are really starting to piss me off
oh does that mean youre not going to come wiggle on the bed anymore or stroke my hair real soft and concerned or kiss me like a soap opera acting
piece of shit
palomino snaps and lunges for nicole
she leaps to the other side of the bed
ill kick your ass
nick steps between nicole and palomino
ok guys i think we can stop there
you bet your ass we can stop
wanda call me a cab
hold on chad
lets just try to calm down
im out of here man
this movie is bullshit
now wait a second chad
theres no reason for hostility
shut up you fucking loser
the only reason i took this part was because someone said you knew quentin tarantino
youre nowhere man
hey you want to go
im sick of your shit you hostess twinkie motherfucker
whatd you call me
you heard me
say it again
you hostess twinkie motherfucker
palomino suddenly punches nick in the stomach leaving him bent over and gasping for breath
nicole instantly leaps on palominos back and begins pounding her fist on the top of his head
palomino spins wildly trying to dislodge her as wanda rushes forward
alright everyone just stop
stop this right now
as she tries to separate nicole and palomino palomino shoves her hard knocking her down
instantly wolf leaps off the camera and runs up to palomino
alright youve asked for it chad
palomino suddenly punches wolf in the teeth dropping him like a stone
suddenly nick staggers to his feet and rushes at palomino
his momentum knocks all three backwards onto the bed palominos head cracking nicole in the teeth
nicole rolls free as nick and palomino wrestle on the bed
nick gets palomino in a vicious headlock and starts pounding his head against the mattress
you want to pick my brain
this is the way i direct hostess twinkie scumbags like you
as nick continues to pound palominos head the gaffer notices palominos eyes are starting to bug out from the pressure of nicks forearm around his neck
he and the boom man rush forward and finally manage to pry palomino free
get him out of here
someone take him back to his hotel
as the gaffer and boom man drag off the almost unconscious palomino the scriptgirl takes one faltering step after him
suddenly everything becomes quiet except for nicks labored breathing and the scriptgirls sniffles
nick leans over and touches nicoles shoulder
are you alright
dont touch me
the gaffer and ac help the still groggy palomino into the back of the production van
jeff the driver watches them in sleepy curiosity
with palomino safely propped in a seat the ac goes back to the set
the gaffer waits a moment then slips his script out of his back pocket and slaps it into palominos motionless hand
its called tsunami
a japanese tidal wave hits new york
youve an ex navy s
frogman working undercover
you save the city
youd be perfect for the lead
thats my number call me or ill call you
either way its been great working with you man
as palomino stares at him blankly the gaffer slams the door
the car pulls out
nick and nicole are sitting up on the bed alone on the now empty set
nicole im sorry
i didnt mean it
you were great in that richard gere movie
youre no different than he is
you lie youre deceitful
im not lying
christ i tell everyone how great you are
ive got nothing but respect and admiration for you
oh god now youre doing your own fucking script
well why do you think i wrote it
i have no idea
its about you
its about how i feel about you
christ did you get a bump on your head nicky
cause youre talking like an idiot
ive loved you since the day we met
nicole sits for a long moment in stunned silence
why didnt you tell me
i didnt want anything to get in the way of us working together
god and all this time i thought
nick and nicole move into a shy trembling heartfelt kiss
nicole snaps awake with a jolt
she glances quickly at the clock which reads
the sound of the shower still running in the bathroom
nicole leaps out of bed and races into the bathroom
as the camera follows her she closes the bathroom door right against the lens turning the image to total blackness
the frame is black
the recognizable clatter and clunk of the film crew is heard
wandas voice is prominent
dont go out that door
suddenly a door opens away from camera and the ac stops a foot away from the lens
behind him wanda and the rest of the crew can be seen through the door preparing for filming
we see now the door and the plywood walls around it are fake
its part of the set goddamnit
now go around
this is an emergency
the ac rushes past and a moment later the camera dollies slowly through the fake door toward wanda pacing near the set camera
into her walkie has ellen showed up yet
get her into wardrobe right away
scene six scene five has been postponed
im not going to say it again mr
palomino is not working today
now where is that smoke machine
the ac bursts through a door at the end of the hallway and walks quickly toward the camera
without knocking he pushes open the bathroom door and suddenly stops short
standing on his tiptoes at the sink straining to turn off the running faucet is tito a dwarf
he is dressed in a sky blue tuxedo with tails
a top hat and white gloves rest on the closed toilet seat
tito appears extremely annoyed
what do you want
i need to use the bathroom
kind of an emergency
well fucking knock
tito grabs his hat and gloves and marches down the hall the ac staring after him in astonishment
muttering i swear to christ one of these days im going to punch somebody in the balls
camera is close on nicole her eyes clenched shut as a thin white veil is placed on her head
camera pulls back to reveal sachiko the costume designer putting the finishing touches to nicoles costume which appears to be an elaborate white wedding gown
nick stands nearby smoking
just as we pull up to your apartment palomino suddenly says he feels so sick he cant work today
was it something he ate
stand up please
i dont know
can he work tomorrow
turn around please
dont know that either
but im not worrying about it
i had this dream last night where i was on the set
you were in it and another woman someone older
anyway everything was going wrong
the harder i tried to hold things together the more they fell apart
and you know what that dream was telling me nicole
you just got to roll with it
and thats what im doing im rolling with it
so well just shoot the dream sequence today
just then tito walks in
you look great man
i feel like shit
no you look good
thanks for coming in on such short notice
this is nicole shes playing ellen
toto is it
oh im sorry
listen if theres anything i can do to make you
if you need
uh just let me know
put a stool in the bathroom
tito walks out followed immediately by sachiko leaving nicole alone with nick
did i just offend him
what did you say
come on that was nothing
im the one who called him toto
jesus im out of it
i dreamt i was on the set last night too
you were in the dream
was i freaking out
actually you were
thats great i freak out in my dream i freak out in your dream
no wonder im fucking exhausted
nicole stares at nick for a long moment then smiles briefly and turns away
a dented ancient smoke machine squats forlornly in the middle of the set
wolf with eyepatch the gaffer ac boom man and the sound man stand around it scrutinizing it intently
wolf seems in an unusually good mood
alright guys special effects today
could be fun
who knows how to work this baby
its the old t
i used it once in
thats where the gas goes
no thats where the oil goes
i think so
its coming back now
im going to let you handle this one bob
this is your baby
and les if he needs help you give him a hand
were all working together today
wolf walks off
the gaffer kneels to inspect the smoke machine closer
yup all coming back now
like riding a bike
way to go bob
wanda stands alone by the camera looking around at the bustling crew like a battalion commander watching her troops in battle
nick approaches her
how are we doing wanda
not good nick
not bad but not good
we need to finish this scene and do scene thirty one today
scene thirty one
i left my notes for scene thirty one at home
i didnt know we were nick nick
ill send someone to your apartment to pick them up
send somebody to my apartment to pick them up its the red notebook under the bed
its taken care of nick
nick walks off quickly muttering to himself
a moment later wolf strolls up to wanda
were all lit the smoke machine is under control were ready to go
hard what about the dolly
just need to see a run through and were all set
im going to make your job easy today wanda
he slips his arm around her mmm im glad you wore that perfume
and dont worry about palomino ill take you to a jazz club tonight
oh i cant make it
i have to go see chad hes extremely ill
oh by the way my eyes much better
listen wolf this may not be the best time to say this but our relationship is going nowhere
what do you mean
please dont take it personally
because i care for you wolf i really do
but ive had this feeling for quite a while and i think its time we ended it
pause i think its better
so do i
great cause we still have to work together and theres no reason it has to be unpleasant
give me a hug
wanda and wolf move into an extremely wooden embrace
youre a real special guy wolf
wanda slips wolf a tender smile then walks away
into her walkie ok lets get the a team in please
nick ellen mr
nick is working with the crew and the actors
the set consists of two flats one with the fake door joined to make a corner
the flats are painted fire engine red
ok heres the shot
we start wide with ellen standing absolutely still right in the middle of the frame
you got that wolf
notices eyepatch what happened to your eye
its a little sensitive today
can you see
snaps of course i can see
for a moment nick looks like he might snap back at wolf but he draws a deep breath and continues
ok ellen is standing there
the smoke is flowing in and ellens line
i am so hungry
good tito thats your cue
the fake door opens and tito enters wearing his top hat and carrying a golden apple in his gloved hands
you walk around her once hold the apple out thats right just beyond her reach
youre staring at her hard
then stop right here
can we get a mark please
the ac moves up to nick and places a piece of yellow tape on the floor
cu the yellow tape
then we dolly in to titos close up
it should be hand held
no i think its better on the dolly
nick do i see him
no just the apple
and tito right after we dolly in give me a little laugh there
a little laugh
big little anything you feel like doing
lets shoot one
call it wanda
ok here we go
camera back to one
action on the smoke
the gaffer turns on the smoke machine which emits a pathetic wisp of smoke that immediately dissipates
and roll sound
hold it wanda
can we get a little more smoke
is that possible
the gaffer adjusts a knob and another thin puff of smoke wheezes out
call it wanda
going for picture
lock it up
and roll sound
scene six take one
nicole stands motionless in the middle of the empty set
her white wedding gown stands out sharply against the deep red walls
a sad shred of smoke drifts by her head
i am so hungry
tito opens the door and walks in staring hard at nicole
his sky blue tuxedo gleams in the rich light
he walks around her in a circle holding the golden apple just beyond her reach
he stops on his mark and the camera dollies into a cu of him
he doesnt laugh
nick watches this for a moment in intense concentration
thats a cut
yeah just a couple
i thought that was uh
tito that was very good man really
you didnt feel like laughing
oh ok i guess i missed it
you could make it bigger if you want
and ellen maybe just a little more tension when you see him
i thought i didnt see him
right maybe you see him a little bit
alright im confused
do i see him or not
you see him
ok what is the tension
who is toto
hard its tito
alarmed what did i say
im sorry tito
i dont know why im doing that
im really sorry
ellen come on now concentrate
remember youre marrying damian tomorrow
youre a little anxious
you have this dream
lets call it an anxiety dream and tito represents the anxiety
cu tito looking none too happy about this representation
it seems pretty simple
lets just try it
and bob lets really have some smoke on this one
ok more smoke
i still think it should be hand held
yeah well i dont want it hand held
i want it on the dolly
wheres my notebook wanda
on its way nick
call it wanda
lock it up
going for picture
and roll sound
scene six take two
nicole stands motionless as a few more emaciated puffs of smoke hang in the air
i am so hungry
tito enters walks around her holding the apple just beyond her reach then moves to his mark
the camera dollies into a cu
he does not laugh
thats a cut
going again nick
going again please stand by
ok ellen good
youre on to something there
no somethings not right
it all feels fake to me
nicks tone with nicole suddenly takes on an almost imperceptible edge tinged with annoyance
well its not fake its real
just remember you really want the apple
tito i still think we could see more of a laugh at the end
what kind of laugh
just a laugh
im thinking maybe like this
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
everyone watches nick demonstrate the laugh
he seems unaware he resembles a drunken slightly annoyed idiot
something like that
and remember tito this is a dream
not everything has to make sense
a laugh right there heightens our sense of
wolf how was that for you
i still think it should be hand held
snaps well god damn it
its not going to be
its on the dolly so just forget about it
there is a strained moment of silence on the set as everyone witnesses this rebuke
and bob what the fuck is that smoke
might as well get a couple hamsters in here blowing smoke rings for christs sake
the septic valve wasnt open
i got it now
were going to see some smoke now
alright lets try another take
and lock it up
nick could i talk to you for a minute
sighs in exasperation alright
nick follows wolf off the set
release the lock up
everyone stand by
well see some smoke now
way to go bob
as soon as wolf and nick reach the darkened corner wolf whirls to face nick
i really dont like being spoken to like that nick
yeah well i dont like your attitude
i dont have an attitude
the hell you dont
every time i ask you to do something all i get is no no no and im sick of it
i hired you to do a job if youre not going to do it you better let me know right now
wolf is about to yell back at nick when suddenly he stops and lets out a deep painful sigh
im sorry nick
im going through some heavy shit
what do you mean
i cant really go into it
its pretty heavy
wolf makes a slight motion with his head toward wanda who is standing some distance away watching them
seeing the two men looking at her wanda shoots them a hard glare which prompts wolf and nick to turn away quickly
personal professional emotional
its doing a number on me
and now youre telling me youre going to fire me
i didnt say that wolf
come on im not going to fire you
youre doing a great job here
yeah i dont know what id do without you man
youve got a great eye
i just hope its not the one under that eyepatch
nick lets out a tense strained laugh but wolfs only response is to stare back at him sadly
let me tell you one thing ive learned sometimes you just have to roll with things
roll with it man
youll be ok
wolf lets out another deep sigh
the gaffer boom man and ac kneel around the smoke machine
a can of gas and a quart of oil stand beside them
thats where the oil goes
no thats where the gas goes
im tellin you bob
thats where the oil goes
lester dont you think bob knows where the oil goes
i dont remember using oil in
maybe both the oil and gas go in there
the gaffer and boom man turn and look at the ac for a long moment
i think hes right
i think he is too
ok three parts gas one part oil
the gaffer and boom man pour liberal amounts of gas and oil into the t
nick rushes up to his position by the camera
is my notebook here yet wanda
any minute nick
call it wanda
going for picture
lock it up
and roll sound
scene six take three
nicole stands motionless in her white wedding dress looking genuinely alarmed possibly because of the huge clouds of smoke now spewing out of the panting smoke machine
i am so hungry
tito enters stares at her hard and walks around her in a circle holding the apple just beyond her reach
the smoke is so thick both of them are barely visible
just as tito gets to his mark the smoke machine backfires with a tremendous explosion and begins filling the room with dense blinding smoke
the smoke blanks out the entire frame
frantic shouts are heard from unseen bodies
turn it off
turn it off
i cant find the switch
pull the plug
pull the plug
open the door
get some water
i got it
i got it
the smoke machine emits a loud hiss and dies filling the room with sudden silence
slowly the smoke begins to clear as the crew moves around muttering and coughing
clear the set
please step off the set
im off the set
so am i
then who is that
who is that
please step off the set
a pair of fuzzy slippered feet enter the smoky frame
the camera booms up passing over a womans bare shins a flowered blue silk housecoat until finally coming to rest on the pleasantly smiling face of cora
this is the same woman who played ellens mother in part one she is dressed exactly the same as she was in their scene
the camera pulls back to reveal jeff the intern standing nervously beside her with a red notebook in his hands
nick gapes in utter astonishment
wanda speaks urgently into the phone while nicole stands beside her
jeff still wearing his hat waits at a distance clutching nicks red notebook
cora reve r e v e
blue housecoat blue slippers
how do i know
because shes sitting ten feet away from me
well sweetheart thats going to be a real fucking problem
nicole turns away and walks past jeff to the craft service table
she was waiting outside nicks apartment when i went to pick up his notebook
she said she was looking for him so i figured i should just bring her up here
you look really pretty in that dress
nicole nods politely then looks to the makeup corner where nick sits talking earnestly to his mother
how did you get here
i took a bus in went right to your apartment
how did you get out of your room
oh i just went right through the door
it was unlocked
no it was locked
i just went through it
its something ive learned to do nicky
i can walk through just about anything like air
mom youve got to stop doing this
im a little upset with you
you could have gotten lost or hurt
i wanted to see you
ive missed you
i know mom ive missed you too
but its not really a good time
nicole approaches holding up the hem of her wedding gown
there is a subtle tension smoldering between her and nick
theyre sending a car
it should be here in a couple of hours
they didnt even know she was gone
jesus i dont believe this
im sorry nick
if i knew there was going to be a wedding i would have worn my fucking hat
the camera holds on tito pacing slowly alone on the set
he is smoking fiercely holding his top hat with one hand
suddenly he begins laughing in a loud stage bellow
nick sets a chair for his mother and helps her sit down
nicole joins tito on the set and talks quietly to him
hows that mom
can you see
is the little fellow going to do gymnastics
tito glances up at her quickly
now come on mom
youve got to be quiet
whispers wanda and wolf stand beside each other in tense awkward silence for a long moment
how are you doing
good real good
wolf looks as if hes about to burst into tears as nick walks up
hows the smoke machine
its dead nick
ive got calls out to every effects house in the city but i just cant seem to locate forget it
well shoot without it
but nick its a dream sequence
thats the way it goes wanda
were just going to have to roll with it
nothing else we can do
weve got to roll with it right wolf
wolf meets nicks eyes and gives an extremely melancholy nod
nick turns to address nicole and tito and the edge immediately slips back into his voice
ok here we go
ellen youve got to keep reaching for that apple
i dont feel that you really want it
i mean christ how many times do i have to tell you
nicole glares at nick for a moment then abruptly turns and walks off the set
nick stares after her in confusion then quickly follows her
everyone stand by
going again right away
nicole stands with her back to the camera as nick strides up to her with impatience
whats the matter
you tell me
youre the one with the bug up your ass
now wait just a second
youve been picking on me all day
i cant do anything right
im sorry if i was short with you nicole but i think you can see im under a little pressure here
im shooting a dream sequence without a smoke machine my mothers out there thinking shes at a circus wedding and you tell me the whole movie seems fake
i never said that
you did too
you said everything feels fake
i meant me
i feel fake
everything im doing feels fake
i cant act
i should just do shower scenes in richard gere movies for the rest of my life
nicole thats ridiculous
youre a fantastic actress
all you have to do is show me you want that apple more than anything else in the world dont give up
you cannot give up
suddenly wanda yells out
nick rushes back onto the set
ok here we go
everybody focus concentrate
and tito were still looking for that little laugh pal
call it wanda
there will be no smoke in this scene
no smoke in the dream sequence
and roll sound
scene six take four
nicole stands motionless in her wedding gown
i am so hungry
tito walks in stares at her hard then walks around her once with the golden apple just beyond her outstretched hands
he stops and the camera dollies into his close up
nick watches in hopeful expectation
he waits and waits but tito does not laugh
just then the door in the rear set wall opens and cora steps in looking oddly puzzled
oh i thought this was the tv room
thats a cut
going again right away
nick escorts his mother back to her chair
mom listen to me
i dont want you to move from this chair
do you understand
oh jesus you sound just like your father
mom im serious
i wont move
nick walks back on the set and addresses nicole and tito
laughs tito i think were having a little communication problem here
all i want you to do is laugh
i told you why
tell me again
wolf still wearing his eyepatch walks over and sits quietly in a chair beside cora
he does not speak to her and gazes blankly out at nick tito and nicole on the set some distance away
cora however stares at the side of his head with such intensity wolf cant help but turn to her
cora still doesnt take her eyes off him and in fact stares even more intently into his eye
wolf glances away for a moment then looks back
cora continues to stare at him
suddenly his eye is full of tears
cora watches in rapt silence
wolf is crying openly now
cora reveals no hint of emotion as she reaches out and gently lifts the eyepatch off of his eye
a tight smile of satisfaction creases her lips as a tiny pool of tears is released streaming quickly down wolfs cheek
no one sees this
nick paces tensely in front of nicole and tito
its not that big a deal
its a dream alright
strange things happen in a dream
all you have to do is laugh
why is that such a problem
why does it have to be a dwarf
why does my character have to be a dwarf
he doesnt have to be a dwarf
then why is he
is that the only way you can make this a dream put a dwarf in it
no tito thats not have you ever had a dream with a dwarf in it
do you know anyone whos had a dream with a dwarf in it
i dont even have dreams with dwarves in them
the only place ive seen dwarves in dreams is in stupid movies like this
make it weird put a dwarf in it
everyone will go whoa whoa whoa must be a dream theres a fucking dwarf in it
well im sick of it
you can take this dream sequence and shove it up your ass
tito hurls his top hat and gloves to the floor and walks out
everyone stares at nick who is frozen in stunned silence
finally wanda approaches him hesitantly
no response i can get right on the phone
well try to get another
small person here as soon as possible
hes absolutely right
nick sighs heavily and sinks to sit on the dolly in silence
wolf appears behind him still wiping his eyes
you want to just shoot ellen nick
she could be in the dream by herself
were not going to shoot anything
thanks for all your help but its over
i cant take it anymore
i tried to roll with it but its time to face the music i cant do this
i am not a director
the shoot is over
i give up
nicks speech has the simple eloquence of truth he is not bitter or self pitying
he seems unaware of how disturbing this is to the crew
they all stand around him in shock afraid to move or speak
finally wolf turns to the ac and puts his hand on his shoulder like a father to his young son
take the camera off the dolly
start putting it away
everyone watches the ac unfasten the camera in silence
nicole stands alone on the set in her wedding dress still holding the golden apple
her face is frozen in dismay
suddenly cora comes through the set door and marches up to nicole
give me that apple
at the sound of his mothers voice nick looks up
he sees her snatch the apple from nicoles hand and march back out the door closing it behind her
behind the door im ready nick
nick gets up slowly and whispers intensely to wanda wolf and the rest of the crew
wolf grabs the camera and puts it on his shoulder hand held as the rest of the crew moves quickly and silently into position
on a terse signal from nick the camera starts rolling
nicole takes the silent action cue from nick
i am so hungry
right on cue cora walks through the door holding the golden apple out in front of her
she circles nicole with determination seemingly oblivious to nick and the rest of the crew hovering behind wolf as he begins following her with the hand held camera
wolf is now in his element gliding like nureyev with the camera
when he pans suddenly with cora the whole crew ducks wildly and dives out of camera range
cora finally stops circling nicole and stops abruptly
suddenly she raises the apple right out in front of nicole
wolf glides forward with the camera framing an amazing cu of the apple with nicole seen behind it
nicole reaches out grabs the apple and takes a huge resounding bite out of it
cu nicks face eyes wide in anxious delight
cora takes one step forward
cu her fuzzy slippers stopping right on the yellow tape mark
cora waits momentarily until wolf has reframed both her and nicole then lets out a huge laugh
general mayhem erupts on the set
wolf talk to me man
did you get it
got it nick
the close up
thats what i meant about going hand held
youre a genius man
what about the focus
wolf slaps the acs palm then the gaffers standing right beside him
he turns gleefully to the next person but seeing it is wanda he rigidly turns away
going again nick
how was the sound
i could use another but definitely acceptable
nick runs up to his mother and throws his arms around her
nicole stands beside him
mom you kook
that was incredible
did you know we were filming
testily of course i knew you were filming
you were great youre a natural
and nicole that was beautiful
dont you dare tell me that felt fake
suddenly on an impulse surprising both of them nick and nicole embrace
just then wanda steps up
going again nick
oh hold on
let me think a second
the set grows suddenly quiet as nick begins pacing rapidly muttering to himself
can i use it for the dream sequence thats the question
does it work for the dream sequence
nick suddenly looks up and sees everybody staring at him nicole in her wedding gown wolf with his eyepatch his mother still eating the apple wanda the crew
were going with it wanda
alright everyone listen up
that is a wrap on scene six
the set erupts in applause
i need to record room tone
ill need thirty seconds of silence
thirty seconds of room tone
the sooner youre quiet the sooner were done
whispers to nick whats room tone
its for the sound mom
we just have to be quiet
at that moment a door opens at the rear of the set and a doctor and nurse enter
the nurse carries an extra overcoat
jeff the driver turns and sternly whispers for them to be quiet
and roll sound
the camera is wide showing the entire set actors and crew
everyone stands in perfect silence as motionless as statues
as the silence continues the mood on the set gradually changes
one by one people drift into their own private worlds of reflection
ms the sound man alternately watching his recorder and his stopwatch
behind him the boom man holds the mike in position to record general ambiance while staring off into the distance
cu the tape recorder spinning in quiet precision
cu the stopwatch its giant second hand showing five seconds have passed
ms nick standing next to his mother who drapes one arm casually over nicks shoulder
nick glances up and sees nicole beside him absorbed in her own thoughts
suddenly she looks up and her eyes meet nicks
she slips him the barest hint of a smile
the camera dollies slowly through the standing silent group passing over faces in different degrees of thought
cu the sound mans stopwatch the giant second hand showing ten seconds have passed
he is so immersed in thought he looks at no one
the camera slowly dollies into a cu of him
chad palomino stands at a gleaming podium looking radiant in an immaculate tuxedo
he holds an envelope in his hands
we have a new category this year best film ever made by a human being
and the winner is none other than my best bud nick reve
amid thunderous applause nick bounds on the stage and accepts an oscar from chad
he stands grinning like an idiot as the applause continues
ms nick still wrapped in thought his lips starting to form the same idiotic smile
the camera dollies slowly into her face now tinged with a slight uneasiness
wide shot at the counter
nicole stands facing a large bald man with his back to the camera
she is wearing a cheap pink waitress uniform and has her hair under a hairnet
had any experience
i was an actress for a while
she pulls her headshot out of her shoulder bag and hands it to the man with a hopeful smile
he flips over the headshot and looks at her credits with confused annoyance
yeah but can you cook a hamburger
she jerks her head slightly in response to this moment of thought
cu the stopwatch showing fifteen seconds have passed
the camera begins a slow dolly into his cu
wolf stands like thor in the middle of the red set his arms crossed over his chest his jaw set in determination
smoke billows around him
at his feet dressed in nicoles wedding gown wanda sobs hysterically
wolf im sorry
please forgive me
i love you wolf
give me one more chance
let me prove it
i love you
i love you wolf
wolf remains unmoved for a long moment
finally he reaches out with a forgiving smile and pats wandas head
he glances furtively at wanda with a trace of hope still in his eyes
ms wanda looking off
the camera dollies into her cu
this is the same hotel room from part two in which we saw nicole and chad palomino
at the moment wanda and chad lie panting in the sweat soaked sheets
what i love about you chad is youre not afraid of my power
oh god wanda
i love your power
its like an afferdesiac to me
she shifts slightly and glances quickly around her
her smile is tinged with the hint of sexual pleasure
ms the gaffer frowning absorbed in thought
the camera dollies into a cu of him
suddenly a cu of an incredibly beautiful hamburger being placed in a toasted bun on a gleaming white oval plate
a hand places a garnish of parsley on it then carries the plate to the lunch counter
camera pans to reveal the gaffer sitting on the stool
he picks up the hamburger and takes a huge bite out of it
this shot holds for quite some time as he continues to chew
ms the gaffer
a hopeful delicious smile spreading over his face
cu the sound mans stopwatch the giant second hand showing twenty seconds have passed
she gazes serenely out before her
in the pale afternoon light cora stands in the middle of her drab barren room
she appears to be staring at the door
suddenly she begins striding toward it
effortlessly easily she walks right through it
nick still stands at the podium with his oscar
in closing id like to say to all the people who told me not to make this movie who wouldnt meet with me or return a simple phone call
to my favorite professor at film school whose parting advice to me was to take a job teaching at a womens college
to delores delsporto the girl i loved in high school who left me for a jr
varsity football player to all these people id like to say thank you but i cant because what i really feel like saying is go fu ms nick his head
and body jerking in a sudden spasm
he finishes the last word of his speech in a choked whisper and the sound man frowns hard at him
cu the sound mans stopwatch showing twenty five seconds have passed
the camera stays on the watch until the final five seconds have elapsed
and thats a cut on room tone
the room erupts with activity
everyone moves and talks at once
nick whispers something to nicole then runs off
ok strike the set
redress for scene thirty one
right away people
anyone seen nick
ws the set
suddenly the fake door closes right into the lens turning the frame completely black
