written by peter straughan jon ronson more of this is true than you would believe
he is staring at us with fixed concentration
he is sweating slightly in the summer heat
we hold for a moment
silence apart from the soft swish of an unseen ceiling fan
wide shot the man wearing military uniform sits at his desk in his office still staring straight ahead
supered titles appear reading general putkin united states army intelligence sed
the generals assistant lieutenant boone sits at his desk working
after a moment putkin seems to come to a decision
im going into the next office
the general stands up smooths down his uniform steps out from behind his desk and begins to walk
boone watches with some trepidation as the general increases his pace
he quickens to a jog his face set with determination
he breaks into a run
then he slams into the wall of the office rebounds and lies splayed on the floor
he stares up at the wall balefully
general putkin is being driven in a jeep through the vast military base
he has a band aid over his injured nose
supered titles read special forces command centre fort bragg north carolina
i have been having ideas gentlemen
and when i thought about these ideas i thought about who in the u
s army would be most receptive to my challenging ideas
the jeep pulls up at the special forces command centre
the general gets out a brief case in his hand and surveys the centre
which section of the military is always straining to reach the peak of their physical and mental capabilities
general putkin stands in front of a room full of seated you are gentlemen
the assembled officers nod modestly
i want to talk to you about mind wars gentlemen
his audience stare at him
with a flourish he produces a bent fork from his briefcase
howd you like to be able to do this
what if you could teach soldiers to do this
would you be interested
changing tack or or lets say you have a unit operating outside the protection of mainline units
what happens if someone gets hurt
how do you deal with that
he surveys the blank faces
protect the unit with hands off healing
using the mind to heal
putkin senses he is not convincing his audience
lets talk about time
what if time is not a point but a space and at any one instant we can be anywhere in that space
laughing physicists go nuts when i say that
he is growing desperate
stopping the hearts of animals
this is the idea im coming to you with
you have access to animals right
special forces look like theyve had enough
a tough looking officer major jim holtz stirs
we dont have access to animals
a dejected general putkin climbs back into his jeep
lieutenant boone in the driving seat looks at him with sympathy
in when special forces told general putkin that they werent interested in his ideas
that was a lie
the bent fork sits on the table in the extreme foreground a window in the background
and when they told him they didnt have access to animals
that was also a lie
we focus on the window a shaky zoom taking us towards an abandoned looking hospital building half hidden by trees
we track forward into the shadowy interior into a large space which we now see is full of
the hundred goats in the disused hospital building had been secretly flown in from central america so as to avoid customs
special forces werent worried about the general hearing the goats because theyd been de bleated
the goats stare at us their mouths silently opening and closing
this is the story of those goats
we close on the unblinking eyes of one goat then
bob sits typing at his desk in the modest office
he wears glasses is attractive in a fresh faced enthusiastic kind of way
supered titles read ann arbor michigan january
my name is bob wilton
imagine me back in michigan where i was born and raised
i studied journalism at western in kalamazoo and then i got a job at the ann arbor daily telegram
i wrote a lot of stories about competitive food eating contests
he looks at the photograph of his wife debora on his desk and up to where she stands photocopying in dave the editors office
dave is chatting to her
he has a prosthetic arm
bob watches his wife smiling
look at me
the past is a different country
do things there
we pan to the next desk and bobs over weight colleague ron who sits eating a hot dog
this is ron
ron suddenly pitches violently forward thudding face first into his desk
hes the man who died
bob is clearing rons desk putting his possessions into a box
my wife debora told me later that rons death had been like a wake up call for her what people used to call a memento mori
bob sits down feeling a little ghoulish at the dead mans desk
he notices a large indentation on the leather in front of him the mark left by rons forehead
he touches it fascinated
that massive coronary had reminded her that life was too short to waste any chance of true happiness
bob rests his own forehead experimentally onto the indentation and sits there face down on the desk
his eyes wander over to where dave and debora are talking in daves office
v deboras hand brushes against daves lingers just a fraction too long
a week after the funeral she left me for my editor
bob and debora and dave talking
bob is drinking
we jump cut to bob crying smashing a lamp debora shouting at him
a sad chuckle it seemed like such a tragedy at the time
we couldnt see beyond our little lives to the great events of history unfolding out there in the world
jump cut to dave holding bob in a head lock with his one good arm
debora is sitting head in hands
i was like a child
or a hobbit safe in the shire
jump cut to bob alone in the trashed room exhausted and drunk watching bushs state of the union speech on tv
or a blonde farm boy on a distant desert planet unaware that he was already taking the first steps on the path that will lead him inexorably towards the heart
of a conflict between the forces of good and evil
on tv americans are a resolute people who have risen to every test of our time
adversity has revealed the character of our country to the world and to ourselves
bob wipes his eyes stares at the screen
had i known where that path would lead had a soft wind from my future brought me the name of bill django i might never have gone
but as it was i did what so many men have done throughout history when a woman has broken their heart
i went to war
we hear the opening of a period song as we
as the titles and song continue we see u

mnbc promo american flag draped photomontages with the words our hearts go with you
apache helicopter attacks and destroys an iraqi tank
tv presenters debate who is the hottest scud stud
soldiers plant an american flag with iwo jima like american troops pull down a huge statue of saddam hussein in central baghdad
an american flag draped over the head is hastily replaced by an iraqi flag
bob sits on the bed talking to debora on the phone
yeah no its been

bob stares out of the window nodding afraid he might start to cry
oh thats thats
he beats his head off the wall for a moment

bob walks out and puts his sunglasses on staring around the quiet pool side area
he sighs sits down on a a sunlounger starts to read his book
titles read kuwait city kuwait spring

bob is drinking coffee with two gung ho type war correspondents
ive been stuck here
theyve only just given me the green light
so ill probably head over there soon
im just working on this story about american contractors coming over for the re build
the journalists look bored
yeah i think they didnt want me going over because im not embedded
yeah they dont like the unilats
the troops think the unilatsll stab em in the back
when youre you form a bond with the soldiers
youre like one of them
to second you see action

the thunder run
heard you had it pretty bad
could say that
technicals all the way rpgs fuckers were firing anti aircraft guns at us
you know a private first class zuchero
i was standing next to him when he took a hit
bob sits ignored feeling inadequate as they continue to swap war stories
bob sits drinking more coffee
to waiter so whats a useful phrase
la termi ana sahafi
bob repeats this
whats that mean
dont shoot im a reporter
he walks off
bob sighs continues doodling in his notebook
we see he has covered the page in stylized drawings of eyes
he notices a a man in a baseball cap sitting at the next table
without looking up hey
bob reads the logo on the baseball cap
we make trash cans
you over here for the conference
looking for a contract right
whats your pitch
the man considers this
he looks up and we see his face for the first time handsome older than bob tanned a moustache a slightly haunted expression
this is lyn well
were real cheap
bob waits for more but thats it
he holds out his hand
could i bum a smoke skip
lyn shoves the packet across the table
bob sits down across from him pats himself down for a lighter glances over to where the two embedded journalists are joking with some marines
bob watches them jealously
i sat there watching those reporters and realized i didnt want to be me anymore
i wanted to be them
i wanted to face peril and stand witness to the fall and rise of nations
suddenly the terrace light above them flickers and goes out
lyn and bob sit in the dark
everyone gets everything he wants
like the man said
i wanted a mission
patting his pockets in the dark oh crap cant find my
a lighter ignites in lyns hand eerily lighting the lower half of his face his eyes hidden by the brim of the cap
bob leans forward to light his cigarette and finds himself staring at the conference i
d lyn has pinned to his shirt
the name on the badge reads lyn s
and for my sins fate brought me one
he stares at the name as he puffs on the cigarette vaguely troubled by a memory
bob pulls up in a car outside
supered titles read monroe michigan this is the home learning course were putting out which is very popular
bob is interviewing gus lacey at laceys dining room table
gus has a sun bed tan and odd hair
his nervous looking mother sits beside them
gus is holding up a video case for bob to see the cover illustrated with a picture of gus reads free to roam learn e
p from the master
then theres the seminars
when im not teaching i spend a lotta time right here remote viewing
the kitchen table
that is correct
thats where my body is
but my mind
thats you know
he gestures to the horizon
so what have you seen lately
lately ive been watching the loch ness monster in scotland england which it turns out is the ghost of a dinosaur
thats an exclusive for you
u of bobs notebook on which he has written you are crazy
when did this all start for you gus
it started when i was a kid
i used to lie on my bed and rv my cousin irene undressing at night
then when i was in the army i joined bill djangos unit
he trained me and the rest as they say
i dont know who that is
gus gives a dreamy smile
i cant really talk about bill
so what did you do in the army
we were psychic spies mainly
that was our initial tasking but
once they realized what they were sitting on the forces at work
he stops his face darkening
we were trained to kill animals
you mean what
with our minds
that is correct
just by staring at them
what kind of animals
one of our unit stopped the heart of a goat
beat i dont know what to say
the power they unlocked in us
beat sorrowfully last week i killed my hamster
beat you wanna see
tv screen playing a home video of two hamsters in a cage
bob and gus sit watching the tv
gus mother hovers in the background
you ever seen a hamster do that before
well ive never owned a hamster gus so i dont know what
look at the way its glaring at its wheel
usually that hamster loves its wheel
maybe some of the readers have hamsters so
then theyll know how rare that is
yeah i guess any hamster owning readers will know whats aberrant behavior and uh whats
oh shit hes down
on tv one of the hamsters has fallen over
yeah hes down
at this point id been staring at him for about three hours
the other hamster falls over
oh my god
youve dropped both hamsters
no the other ones just fallen over
they watch in silence
then the hamsters get up and start eating
switching off the bizarre
it didnt die
i thought you said you killed it
he gestures to his mother mother said no
she said you might be a bleeding heart liberal
she said dont show him the hamster dying
show him the tape where the hamster acts bizarre instead
bob looks to gus mother who manages to look nervous and defiant at the same time
gus stares at the blank tv sips his coffee
this was nothing
you should have seen the skipper at work
whos the skipper
after bill he was the most psi gifted guy i ever met
he was like an occultic force
beat i think he runs a dance studio now
bobs notebook as he writes down the name lyn bob straightens from lighting his cigarette stares at lyn
do you know a gus lacey
lyn gets up and walks away
bob hurries to catch up with lyn
he follows him around a corner and skids to a halt
lyn is facing him standing on one leg hands raised above his head in an odd martial arts stance
he emits a threatening croon
bob raises his hands nervously
you working for hooper
i work for the ann arbor daily telegram
how do you know about lacey
i interviewed him a few years ago
hed been appearing on this radio talk show
lyn relaxes his martial arts stance shakes his head ruefully
whatd he tell you
he said he joined bill djangos unit in the army and was trained to to uh remote view
and he said the loch ness monster was the ghost of a dinosaur
whos bill django
shaking his head in did he show you his home study course
walking off down the yeah i bet he did
hurrying after him are you
do you mean you corroborate his uh
because see i thought he was just an idiot
he is an idiot
or he was
hes dead now
he was a paranormal whore
always trying to get into the spotlight yak yak yaking
we took an oath
we dont divulge
but youre saying there was a secret unit
lyn stops turns and stares at him
bob and lyn are talking passing a bottle of scotch backwards and forwards between them
both are drunk
let me ask you something
what color were the chairs in the hotel bar
you were in there for hours
what color were the chairs
they were green
how many lights are there in this room
bob starts to look around
a super soldier wouldnt need to look
he would just know
a super soldier
a jedi warrior
he would know where all the lights were
he could walk through a room and tell you how many power outlets there were
people are walking around with their eyes closed
at level one we were trained to instantly absorb all details
whats a jedi warrior
youre looking at one
youre a jedi warrior
what does that
i dont think im sergeant first class lyn cassady special forces retired
in the eighties i was trained at fort bragg in a secret initiative code named project jedi
the objective of the project was to create super soldiers
soldiers with super powers
we were the first generation of the new earth army
youve got super powers
hold on let me
let me just
he takes out his notebook fumbling trying to get into journalist mode
okay so so youre saying you were a psychic spy like lacey
we prefer the term remote viewer
how does that work
different jedi had different techniques
mel landau used to visualize packing all his cares and worries in a little suitcase to clear his mind
steve cuttle used to read bible verse
what about you
lyn thinks about it
well i find drinking helps
also if im listening to classic rock music
beat like who
i like boston
boston usually works
bob jots this down in the notebook
what other powers did you practise
taken aback invisibility
that was level three
yeah that was the goal
but after a while we adapted it to just finding a way of not being seen
when you understand the the linkage between observation and reality you learn to dance with invisibility
bob tries to follow this
its not like camouflage
we also practised phasing
crossing from particle to wave from the physical realm to the plane of energy
solid objects seem to pass right through you
its starts with a breathing exercise
lyn makes a weird shallow panting sound
then you think black
thats the nothingness
bob watches him solemnly as he continues his weird panting
can i be honest lyn
i dont know what to make of this
i dont know what to say
this is amazing stuff
beat how would you
could i write a story about this
lyn stops panting takes a swig of whiskey stares at the bottle suddenly taciturn
not going to happen
no but see ive been looking for a story lyn
i was going to write about the re build contracts but this
this is even better and not going to happen
all im saying is we could talk some more tomorrow and
im shipping out tomorrow
youre going home
going to iraq
theres this factory we might be partnering with in al qaim
bobs face falls
they sit in silence for a moment
lyn passes bob the whiskey
he takes a swig his mind whirring
i could come
i could come with you maybe and
bob i dont want to be a story okay
i dont need the attention and
no listen we could change names stuff could stay off record and
its a war over there bob
i cant be looking out for you
bob flushes with annoyance
well you know you dont
i look after myself
i look after
and ive been in some pretty hairy situations before
im not you know
im a journalist lyn
he slaps his notebook for emphasis
i go where the story is
i was an american
i was resolute
i wanted adversity to reveal my character to the world
and to my wife
and to that one armed cunt dave
lyn is staring at bobs notebook
he takes it from bob and examines bobs drawings of eyes
i was just doodling
lyn examines bob something different in his attitude
whats the matter
he considers for a moment struggling with himself then seems to reluctantly come to a decision
he reaches into the bag on his bed and pulls out a dog eared book
he hands it to bob
bob examines the book on the cover is a picture of da vincis vitruvian man and the title pentagon report
the new earth army manual
bob stares at the book
he opens the first page and reads
s army doesnt really have any serious alternative than to be wonderful
bob looks at the disclaimer at the bottom of the page
this does not represent the official position of the united states army at this time
bob looks up at lyn who nods gravely
you wanted to know who bill django was
beat hes the man who wrote that book
lyns car roars down the expressway into southern iraq passing a tank which sits by the road side
a hung over bob sits reading the new earth army manual
the new earth army is a banner under which the forces of good can gather
the courage and nobility of the warrior blended with the spirituality of the monk
the car passes oil fields beyond the buildings thinning out into the desert
the jedi warrior will follow in the footsteps of the great imagineers of the past jesus christ lao tse tung walt disney
bob is still reading
the role of the new earth army is to resolve conflict world wide
jedis will parachute into war zones utilizing sparkly eyes technique carrying symbolic flowers and animals playing indigenous music and words of peace
insert an illustration of a soldier carrying a lamb and some lilies with what appears to be some kind of loudspeaker strapped to his shoulder
whats the sparkly eyes technique
lyn raises his shades and twinkles his eyes at bob for a moment
you see it
i think so
who is this bill django
lyn draws on his cigarette thoughtfully
i dont know where to begin
low angle a young bill django military buzz cut and all trips out of a hovering helicopter and falls head first down towards us
we freeze frame on his yelling face just before it hits the camera
lyn exhales smoke
bill always said it started for him when he fell out of a helicopter in vietnam
bill hits the ground which is luckily mainly composed of mud
he lies stunned as more helicopters lower around him and his platoon begin to debark
the helicopters barely touch the ground before they take off again
supered titles read vietnam january
bill gets up onto his knees and examines his m the barrel clogged with earth
he pokes his finger into the muzzle trying to clean it then finds he cant get it back out again
he tries to pull his finger free glances up and freezes
ahead of bill and his platoon is a wall of dead american troops rotting in the sun
his men stand staring at the wall aghast
a private beside bill snaps and opens fire yelling wildly
over the gun fire knock it off
knock it off
bill grabs him with his free hand and shakes him his m hanging painfully from his other hand
will you knock it off
climbing to his feet jesus
what do you think
a soldier standing next to bill drops the back of his head sprayed over nearby soldiers
everyone stares at the dead man
another shot rings out another soldier drops
the others flinch scan the tree line ahead of them
vc in black pyjamas
one hundred meters
its a woman
the woman is jogging across the tree line ahead weapon in hand
trying to free his okay
what the fu
why isnt anyone firing
his men stare back at him frightened
the soldiers open fire a deafening roar
the woman keeps on running as the foliage above her head is shredded by bullets
no shot comes close
bill watches amazed
every single one of bills men fired high
they instinctively hadnt wanted to shoot another person
later bill would come across a study by general s
a marshall which revealed that only percent of fresh soldiers shot to kill
the rest aimed high didnt fire at all or pretended to be busy doing something else
bullets still flying above her head the woman stops running crouches down and returns fire
bill is shot stumbles backwards and falls into the mud his finger still stuck in his m
he lies there staring up at the sky his expression one of puzzlement as a huge blood stain spreads over his chest
v the edges of our vision darken down as the sound fades out
the darkness flows inwards as if an iris is closing down until only a pin point of white light remains in the centre of the sky
we begin to move towards the light slowly at first and then faster and faster
just as we are about to reach it a vision of the face of the vc woman appears filling the white disc
their gentleness is their strength
we begin to sink back down again faster and faster until the circle of white light has disappeared all together and we are in darkness
bill lies in his bed staring sadly at the other casualties in the ward amputees spinals burns
recovering in hospital bill wrote to general t
l cornplow vice chief of staff for the army explaining that he wanted to go on a fact finding mission to explore alternative combat tactics
the pentagon agreed to pay his salary and expenses for the duration of the journey
we hear the opening of a period song as we
as the track continues we see bill in civilian dress driving down the pacific coast highway
what bill hadnt told the pentagon was that he was really looking for the answer to the riddle of his vision
how could his mens gentleness their general lack of interest in killing people how could this be turned into a strength
how could love and peace help win wars
bill knew where to go to find out
tracking past a row of hot tubs each filled with naked people hugging
we find an uncomfortable bill in one tub filled with embracing hippy men
self consciously he strokes his buzz cut
supered titles read naked hot tub encounter sessions santa rosa

the meditator continues to stare intently at him
then opens his coat to reveal the magnum
strapped to his chest
bill smiles nervously
an arrow identifies the gunman as bill disappeared into the new age movement for six years
bill feels thompson staring at him
he smiles nervously
bill walks down the road towards the entrance gates
his long hair is braided
he has an eye painted on his forehead
like all shamen before him he had traversed the wilderness
now he was returning to his people a changed man
the sentries at the gate check bills pass suspiciously
he brought with him his confidential report the new earth army manual
the gates swing open and bill passes through
lyn crouches revolving a curious aluminium cone towards the sun
bob sits by the car reading the manual
he looks up watches lyn
does it direct your powers
does it direct your psychic powers or something
what does it do
lyn takes some burgers out of a cooler box and puts them into the cone
it cooks supper
he examines the stove approvingly
utilizing the power of the universe no pollution totally renewable
this is like new earth army technology
bob picks up the manual and starts to read
lyn watches him
pretty mind blowing isnt it
first time i read it i was like
what the fuck
go on what
well its just
its hard to believe the pentagon paid for this
i mean its very interesting but theres nothing in here thats actually about
the new earth army was tasked with preventing conflict
were a force of peace not war
bill realized if you want to change the world youve got to start by changing the armies
he was the one that started the research into non lethals
lyn flicks away his cigarette
check this out
he takes a yellow plastic blob from his pocket with a flourish
beat thats a plastic blob lyn
pointing at the blob thats a
before he can finish lyn has slipped bobs finger into a hole in the middle of the blob and twisted it
youre mine now
the predator is completely biodegradable
its friendly to the earth but it can hurt you in a hundred ways
he takes the blob off the finger and rubs its serrated edge down bobs temple
it has warrior functions
beat and it looks a bit funny
this is new earth army technology
lyn sticks the predator in bobs ear and hauls him to his feet
bob yells with pain
stop hurting me
lyn stares at the blob fondly
i bought it on line
whats cool about it is that you could see this lying on the ground and youd never know it had such lethality
bob holds his ear and pants for breath
lyns face lights up
an empty landscape as bobs shout drifts across the sands
bob watches the red disk of the sun dip below the horizon
lyn checks the meat on the stove looking pissed off
its still raw
i think its officially night now
lyn kicks at the stove
bob and lyn sit in the car
bob is reading the manual eating cold beans from a can
bob suddenly notices lyn has taken a small black case from his bag and is preparing an injection
off bobs look ive got crohns
the steroids help
lyn injects himself packs everything back away in his back pack
bob sits shivering
lyn finishes stares up at the stars thoughtfully
sometimes theres a need bob
sometimes people are calling out for something even if they dont know it themselves
and then a man like bill appears out of nowhere because he heard the call
a circle of officers including major holtz sit around bill who has surrounded himself with a pseudo forest of plants
there are candles everywhere
his face is painted
supered titles read fort bragg
id like us to begin this with a mantra
if we could all breathe in and then out holding a long eeeeee
the officers stare at him
there are sniggers
bill stares them down
they comply and out
bill nods smiling stares around at them
we are a hollow army gentlemen
vietnam has crushed our soul
we are traumatized and melancholic
we are ashamed
that is why i have brought you to this place of sanctuary
here we can mend our wounds and dream our dreams
my dream is of an america that will lead the world to paradise an america that no longer has an exploitative view of natural resources that no longer promotes consumption
at all costs
i believe this is americas destiny
but to achieve it we must become the first superpower to develop super powers
we must create warrior monks men and women who can fall in love with everyone sense plant auras pass through walls stop saying mindless cliches and see into the future
i want you to join me in this vision
beat be all you can be
we track along the officers faces really not sure what to do or say
we reach one officer who looks like lee marvin
this is brigadier general dean hopgood
his eyes are shining with excitement
amongst bills audience that night was brigadier general dean hopgood from the defense intelligence agency
for some time the general had been concerned about information he had been receiving about soviet research into psychic powers
wearing trunks the brigadier general lounges by his pool engrossed in a paper back book titled psychic discoveries behind the iron curtain
according to some stories the soviets were psychically spying on american bases and had designed psychotronic generators machines capable of bombarding the president with negative energy
two diabolical looking russian scientists are wiring up some kittens to a machine
they were also conducting sadistic experiments to see whether animals had psychic powers
another diabolical scientist is wiring up the kittens
could they for instance telepathically detect that their babies were distressed
with a gloating smile one of the scientists approaches one of the kittens with a lit cigarette
the kitten gives a pitiful mew as the scientists looms over it
brigadier general hopgood cant read on
brigadier general hopgood is briefing two senior pentagon but why did the soviets begin this type of research
well sir it looks like they heard about our attempt to telepathically communicate with one of our nuclear subs the nautilus while it was under the polar cap
there was no attempt sir
it seems the story was a french hoax
but the russians think the story about the story being a french hoax is just a story sir
so theyve started psi research because they thought we were doing psi research when in fact we werent doing psi research
but now that they are doing psi research were going to have to do psi research sir
we cant afford to have the russians leading the field in the paranormal
the officials consider this gravely
bill looks in a mirror as he admires his new insignia
two weeks later the army adopted the slogan be all you can be and appointed bill commander of the first new earth army battalion
bob wakes stiff and cold in the front of the car
he sits up and looks around trying to work out where he is
suddenly he realizes he is alone
afraid he scans the landscape around him featureless desert stretches to the horizon
bob jumps out of the car panicking and starts to run in a random direction
as he runs oh god
he stops staring at the immense empty landscape ahead of him
bob turns and sees lyn in a yoga pose on the roof of the car
what are you doing
salute to the sun
he finishes and jumps down
were oscar mike
getting up thats on the move soldier
the car cuts across the vast landscape the day already heating up
bob is writing in his notebook as lyn drives
he notices lyn keeps looking up at the sky
what are you doing
keeps me in shape
bob stares up at the clouds
bob tries to work out which cloud he means
the big one
isnt that one too far away
lyn looks at bob like hes crazy
theyre all far away
he concentrates on the cloud again
sure enough it thins and fades until it has disappeared
bob stares not sure what to think
and its gone
lyn smiling up at the sky doesnt notice that the car is veering off the road a little
the two men are slammed forward as the car hits something bob smacking his face off the dash
we see the car has run straight into a large rock
this is pretty much the only vertical feature in the otherwise flat landscape
the two men stand staring at the wrecked front of the car
bob is holding a handkerchief to his bloody nose
he looks at the car stares around him at the desert stretching out
you had like the whole desert to drive in
lyn rubs his face ruefully
im sorry about that bob
must have got a little bi locational there you know
but dont worry
someonell come along soon
a sweating bob sits in the shadow of the car tossing a coin
lyn sits smoking
checking the coin right
he tosses again
he tosses again
whats your record at this
two hundred and sixty four
he stops listening
we hear the sound of an approaching engine
the two men turn to see a white pick up truck approaching
scrambling to his oh thank christ
bob scuttles into the middle of the road waving frantically
the pick up slows and pulls over
a young iraqi man looks out at them
can you help us
we drove into a rock
could you take us to a town or someplace
smiling the iraqi gestures to the back of the pick up
thanks so much
he grabs his case and climbs up onto the back of the truck
lyn stares at the driver then with a sigh picks up his bag and follows bob
as the truck bumps off down the road bob and lyn sit down and find themselves facing two young iraqi men
thanks so much for this
the two young men smile in a friendly fashion
dont know if we would have lasted much longer
one of the young men nods smiling
he reaches casually forward and takes lyns bag from him
lyn just sits there resigned as the young man roots through the contents
yeah it gets pretty hot out here huh
the young man takes out a rock compilation cd from lyns bag and inspects it
to the other deep purple
laughing too oh you speak english
you guys like deep purple
you like rock or or
he suddenly notices the young iraqi is holding a handgun
the driver leans out the window and shouts something over the roar of the engine
the young man next to lyn takes off his scarf and starts to blindfold lyn with it
smile fading lyn
bob and lyn their hands tied sit on a mattress in the otherwise empty room lit by a shaft of moonlight from the small window above them
from next door comes the faint sound of a period song playing
bob is losing it
were going to die
im going to be killed by al qaeda
from the next room we hear the young iraqis start to sing along to the track laughing
i dont think theyre al qaeda
oh what the hell do you know
you dont know
you dont know anything
and this is all your fault
bob theres something i have to tell you
when i said i was retired from the unit that was a lie
im on a mission
dewitts was just my cover
ive been reactivated
i couldnt tell you because this is a black op but
i think you have a part to play
i think thats why youre with me
bob collapses face down on the mattress
youre an idiot
you want to know why im with you
because i got drunk
starting to cry a little i got drunk and i just wanted to get into iraq so i could prove to my wife i wasnt
just once that i
and now im going to die
im such a
he dissolves into misery
lyn watches with sympathy
have you heard of optimum trajectory before
no answer your life is like a river bob
if youre aiming for a goal that isnt your destiny you will always be swimming against the current
young ghandi wants to be a stock car racer
not gonna happen
little anne frank wants to be a high school teacher
tough titty anne
thats not your destiny
but you will go on to move the hearts and minds of millions
find out what your destiny is and the river will carry you
now sometimes events in life give an individual clues as to where their destiny lies
like those doodles you just happened to draw
he unbuttons his shirt and reveals an eye tattooed on his chest very similar to the one bob had drawn
bob looks up
this is the ajna chakra the third eye the symbol of the jedi
when i saw youd drawn it
well the universe gives me a sign like that i dont ignore it
youre meant to be here with me bob
the jedi inside you sensed that
bob stares at the eye
now listen to me
i dont think these guys are frls or mehdi army
i think were talking standard criminals here okay
what theyre gonna do is try and sell us on to another group
we cant let that happen
how are we gonna stop them
theres three of them
and theyve got guns
were jedi bob
the jedi dont fight with guns
we fight with our minds
what do you mean
lets say we have no choice but to fight with these men
then we use visual aesthetics to instill psychically in the enemy a disincentive to attack
what do you mean
okay you lock eyes with one of them you go into a monotone and you say no im not going to attack you
you totally relax your body and your voice
and then you rip out one of his eyeballs
or you use a pen stab him in the neck create a fountain of blood i mean really a fountain get the blood to squirt on his buddies
thats a psychic disincentive right there
bob thinks about this a little nauseated
we havent got a pen
youre missing the point
standing up here let me show you something
bob stands up reluctantly
i dont want to lyn
what am i gonna do
pointing at his throat just here
i dont think i
theres sharp edges around here
making quotation marks with his fingers attack me
bob stares at him a little annoyed by this
whats with the quotation fingers
thats like implying im you know
only capable of ironic attacking or
quit jawing bob and choke me
well if i choose to choke you what are you going to do
im going to interrupt your thought pattern
bob thinks about this then raises his hands to choke lyn
lyn throws him sailing through the air
he crashes down into the floor behind lyn
i hardly moved
physics wise theres not much going on
its the psychic energy thats important
beat you okay
in pain sharp
helping him up you felt fear didnt you
bob massages his back impressed despite himself
would you say that level of fear was abnormal for you
bob thinks about this
i dont know
i was pretty terrified anyway but the fear i felt on the run up to the choking did seem you know unusual
you know why
it wasnt you
it was me
i was inside your head
fighting with the mind
suddenly the door opens and one of the young iraqis comes in smiling
the white pick up bounces over the sand
bob and lyn sit in the back with one of the young iraqis who has lyns back pack
im sorry i freaked out lyn
you learnt a lesson
whatever you fear most has no power it is your fear that has power
beat you really dont work for dewitts
just my cover
gus lacey said you ran a dance studio
that was just cover too right
i do run a dance school
i love dance
beat and youre really on a mission out here
in time bob
were you just kidding me back there about me having some jedi in me
we learn to recognize our own kind after a while
you ever dream about flying
thats one of the signs
do you really think so
havent you always really felt you were different
bob considers this
yes i have
thats the way it is for us
were the ones who dont fit in as kids
have you always had powers
they used to call me the jinx
two technicians study computers
titles read area groom lake top secret test flight base nevada
into foxtrot has launched
lyn s in uniform walks past and both computers over speakers we just lost contact
the technicians turn to stare after lyn
we hear a siren begin to wail
lyn stands nervously to attention in front of a very grim looking brigadier general hopgood
did you crash those computers
lyn opens his mouth to lie but one glance at hopgoods forbidding countenance changes his mind
a slow grin steals over the generals face
far fucking out
this wasnt the reaction hed expected
howd you feel about a transfer son
a small group of jedi recruits lyn amongst them stands facing a stern bill django in the abandoned looking building
the walls have been decorated with cosmic i am lieutenant colonel bill django
from now on you will speak only when spoken to and the first and last words out of your mouth will be sir yes sir
do you understand
sir yes sir
if you complete this course you will be a psychic weapon an angel of death our enemies worst nightmare
until then you are nothing
less than nothing
do you understand
yeah im only kidding with that shit
okay what shall we do now
he stares around the men expectantly
clapping his hands hey
the jedis are dancing to some rock encouraged by bill
give it everything youve got
the jedis start to dance more frenetically eyes closed jumping about the room waving their arms
bill notices lyn shuffling self consciously from foot to foot
whats your name son
lyn cassady sir
where you from
opelousas louisiana sir
bill stares at lyn taking in his orphan air his hunted look
tough place to grow up
lyn shrugs embarrassed
youve gotta free your feet before you can free your mind lyn
not much of a dancer sir
bill examines lyns face through narrowed eyes
but that isnt true is it lyn
you can dance
its just someone told you not to
a twelve year old lyn is dancing away to a track on the radio
his father weaves drunkenly past the door and stops watching
stop acting so fucking queer
he throws his beer can at lyn and walks on
lyn stares after him upset
the radio abruptly catches fire
bill watches lyn with compassion
well im your commanding officer lyn and im ordering you to let the dance out
lyn starts to dance with a little more abandon
let it go
let it all go
lyn starts to go for it
and its true he can dance
with approval welcome to the heroes journey lyn
lyn smiles shyly
to the room okay remember everyone we dont officially exist as a unit so im afraid theres no coffee budget
bring your own coffee
oh and no solid food for the first week
as the track continues we
uniformed soldiers march double time across the parade deck
i dont know but ive been told eskimo pussy is mighty cold
marching chanting a mantra
soldiers shovel in mouthfuls of creamed potato and steak
sipping their vegetable juice
the jedis stand watching a jeep driving down a course marked out on the field
bill sits next to a nervous jedi trainee who is driving
the jedi is blindfolded
okay youre doing very well
now feel the next bend
the jedis scatter as the jeep swerves erratically off the course and drives straight towards them
soldiers examine a diagram of battle tactics
the jedis examine a blackboard on which bill is writing before going into battle the jedi utilizes a yogic cat stretch
b primal scream and leap
c belgian waffle
d ginseng e amphetamines
the jedis stare doubtfully at the bed of hot coals in front of them
one jedi stands ready his feet bare
okay only when youre ready
the jedi nods nervously hesitates starts to walk on the coals almost immediately starts to scream
think real cold
bill leads the jedis in the earth prayer as they face the setting sun
mother earth my life support system as a soldier i must drink your blue water
i pray my boots will always kiss your face and my footsteps match your heartbeat
i am yours and you are mine
i salute you
bill leads the jedis in another dancing session rock music blasting the men dancing in a variety of nerdish and demented ways
their uniforms have been supplemented with odd personal touches hats badges sunglasses a poncho
we find lyn dancing in blissful idiotic abandonment
after years of feeling like an oddball lyn had finally found a home
at last he was amongst men who prided themselves on being different
bill leads the jedis and brigadier general hopgood in a complex yoga move
we close on lyn
these were golden days for lyn
there was something so noble and pure in bills vision that the jedis felt themselves inspired to be more than soldiers
in a world torn apart by greed and hate they would be a force for good for peace
a butterfly lands on lyns outstretched hand
he watches it with a gentle smile
for the first time in his life lyn felt truly happy
the butterfly flits away and lands on an apple in the tree overhead
then into the garden a serpent did come
guests sit eating dinner around the large table
brigadier general hopgood is talking to his wife
he turns back to find the fork in his hand bent double
he looks in amazement at the man sitting beside him larry hooper was a failed sci fi writer from colorado recruited to the jedis after brigadier general hopgood met him
at a spoon bending party
other guests laugh and applaud
a wedding celebration is in progress
scotty mercer one of the jedi recruits is dancing beaming with his new bride
guests lyn and the other jedis amongst them stand watching clapping and cheering a boisterous atmosphere of bonhomie
larry watches the revellers with contempt
right from the start he had made himself unpopular with the other jedis
scotty and his wife are walking off the dance floor
larry stops him to shake his hand
im sorry it doesnt work out for you two
scottys face falls
the other jedis glare at larry
one of them makes a move towards him but lyn holds him back
the jedis eat at one table
larry sits alone and shunned at another table
lyn walks over with a tray hesitates seeing larry alone
larry made it quite clear that he despised most of the other jedis
feeling sorry for him lyn sits beside larry
larry flushes red
but lyn lyn was different
beat he really hated lyn
scotty larry and lyn sit focusing on a wall of small wooden cupboards
each cupboard has a letter and number printed on its door
the three men focus on the cupboard in question
its something cylindrical
i think its a pencil
larry rolls his eyes up in his head speaks in a high wavering voice with a bad cockney accent
this is larrys spirit guide maud
im looking into the cupboard now and im seeing
a tin mug
lyn stares at his hands focused
he looks up suddenly puzzled
its a man on a chair
bill unlocks the little cupboard and takes a photograph of the lincoln memorial
there are murmurs of admiration from the watching jedis
oh no wait
see i thought you said k not a
bill ignores him smiles at lyn
bravo zulu lyn
larry looks daggers at lyn
lyn is walking calmly over the hot coals as the other jedis watch impressed
bill is leading the jedis in aikido
aikido is a vehicle for harmonizing ourselves with the universe and the way
look upon these sessions as an opportunity to discover yourself and your training partner in a loving environment
larry flails violently at lyn
lyn flips him with ease
larry gets up and charges bellowing at lyn who flips him out of the frame
bill joins lyn
addressing the watching jedis notice how lyns circular motions turned larrys aggression back upon him
good work lyn
a chair flies through the frame just missing lyns head
without looking at larry go outside calm down
lyn lies on a couch drinking a beer staring at a large brown envelope
bill sits beside him with pad and paper
lyn opens the envelope and stares at the photograph of the nato general inside
after a years training lyn was given his first tasking
a senior nato general had been kidnapped by red brigade members in italy
bill was unofficially asked if his unit would be able to help find him before it was too late
were north of verona
its a little town
theres a lake nearby
i can see a cinema
across from the cinema is a shop or or
its a cafe
hes in the apartment above
the town is called
its something sweet
its called dolce
bill looks proudly over to where an important looking official watches from the next room
the official looks impressed
its true that the unit never found out whether any of their remote viewings were accurate or not
nevertheless from that moment on lyns reputation soared
lyn stands in front of the other jedis
these things mean little to the jedi
but growth in spirit in wisdom in psychic power these things earn our respect
he presents lyn with an eagle feather
native americans believed that when one received an eagle feather it was the mark of love of gratitude and ultimate respect
only true human beings may carry the eagle feather
he gives the feather to a deeply moved lyn as the other jedis applaud
larry watches lyn with hate
lyn lies on the couch drinking another beer the eagle feather on a chain around his neck
a period song is playing in the room
the word soon got out in the intelligence community that there was a sergeant at fort bragg who could find whatever you needed found
it was as if lyn could fly anywhere in the world without leaving his room
we track into lyns eye until we are inside his mind
lyns mind p
v we move towards the wall
as bill django said the force truly was strong with this one
as the song breaks into the chorus we burst through the wall into freedom
as the track continues and we race over the land flying faster and faster free as a bird swooping up towards a huge sun until the screens whites out and
as the pick up with bob and lyn in the back pulls up next to another truck
two men dressed in black with their kaffiyeh covering their faces stand by it staring at them
in the back seat of the truck sits a blindfolded iraqi man
the driver of the pick up crosses to the two insurgents with a half gallon bottle of water and passes it to them
they drink and confer briefly in arabic
he turns and gestures to the other two young iraqis who push lyn and bob down from the back of the pick up
lyn stands still
gesturing again etaharrak
its okay bob
were not getting into that truck
the first young iraqi gestures more angrily at the truck
dont move bob
scared whispering are you going to use the blob
lets hope it doesnt come to that
one of the insurgents stirs and says something softly in arabic
the other laughs
angrily the first young iraqi takes out a handgun and levels it at lyn
lyn raises one hand towards him
you can put your weapon away
youre not interested in us
the young iraqi points the gun at bob who starts to walk towards the truck
stay where you are bob
to the iraqi we can go about our business
apparently having had enough one the insurgents pulls his own gun out and aims at lyn
the tension builds
suddenly bob remembers the phrase he was taught
la termi ana sahafi
immediately everyone stares at bob
the insurgent opens fire at him
terrified bob dives across the sand
the young iraqi behind him also scrambles for cover
still firing the insurgent is suddenly aware of lyn sprinting towards him
before he can turn to aim at him lyn leaps into the air spinning around face contorted as he emits a bizarre shriek
we freeze frame on him hung in mid air
now at the time i thought lyn was having some kind of fit here
later i discovered what he was actually doing was performing the echmeyer technique
close on a man who looks like woody allen in a jungle hat
he has his eyes closed in immense concentration
a bead of sweat runs down his face
supered titles read ben echmeyer was a vietnam vet with sixty three confirmed kills
he remains the only non korean to achieve the rank of master in kwa ra do
he was one of the jedi teachers at fort bragg
shooting from behind ben to the rows of jedi recruits watching with expressions of mingled admiration and horror
it was said he could have a tug of war with a dozen men and not move an inch
we pan down the back of ben and find he is naked from the waist down
a sand bag is somehow hanging between his legs
he was also able to lift bags of sand on hooks hung through his scrotum
a recruit raises a hand
sir whats the practical application of this
over head shot ben lies on the ground staring up at us
we hear the sound of an approaching engine
another demonstration involved letting a recruit drive a jeep over him
this in the end was to be his undoing
next second a jeep roars straight over ben going at sixty miles an hour
we freeze frame on the jeep
before his untimely death ben caused quite a stir by advocating his controversial shock and awe knife attack method
ben leaps spastically in the air spinning and shrieking a knife held in one hand
the approach was hailed by some knife aficionados as revolutionary but criticized by others who believed that the leaping and spinning might lead you to accidentally stab yourself
tracking along bens trainee jedis as they watch his display
lyn cassady however became a firm convert to the style
we reach lyn who turns to camera
ben youre not forgotten
the knife you gave me lies next to my beret
god bless ben echmeyer
we un freeze on lyn as he whirls and shrieks towards the insurgent
bob watches amazed from where he lies on the sand
of course lyn didnt actually have a knife with him at this particular time
so i still think what he did was kinda
the insurgent understandably startled flinches backwards trips over the water bottle and falls on his ass
lyn scoops up the gallon bottle of water and begins to pound the fallen man with it
the young iraqi moves to intervene but lyn smacks him in the face with the bottle
the blindfolded iraqi in the truck manages to open the door and stumbles out claws his blindfold off and races away over the sand
the second insurgent is distracted for a moment by his victims flight
when he turns back lyn has scooped up the insurgents gun and is aiming it at him
the sun is rising as the pick up truck roars over the sand and swerves onto the road
bob is leaning out of the window staring at the road behind them
pulling his head back in theyre not coming
oh god were gonna be okay
the truck crests a hill and we see the iraqi man running desperately down the road ahead of us his hands tied
there he is
he puts his foot down and the truck roars after the running man
tracking shot pulling the iraqi man running for all hes worth
lyn leans out of the truck window as he drives up behind him
yelling over the sir
were here to help you
terrified the man sprints faster
lyn tries to pass him but the man veers at the same time and the truck clips him sending him flying
i think i just ran him over
lyn runs over to where the man lies moaning on the road his head bleeding
are you okay
beat bob give me a hand here will you
bob gets out and the two lift the iraqi man and begin to carry him back towards the truck
they stop listening to an approaching rumble
oh shit theyre coming
they scuttle faster back towards the truck the iraqi man dangling between them
next second two gleaming white suvs crest the hill and roar towards them
seeing the road blocked by the truck the suvs screech to a halt and several men in flak jackets and sunglasses tumble out in formation aiming their m s at
lyn and bob
armed mens p
v lyn and bob stare at them before dropping the bound iraqi on the ground
bob waves nervously
we hear the opening of a period song as we
were rushing over a cgi desert between the cgi rivers tigress and euphrates towards a gleaming city rising from the sand
then i say there it is
bob and the iraqi man sit beside todd nixon a suit
lyn sits behind in between two of the private security guards who are nodding along to the music playing in the car
nixon holding the laptop for bob to see watches the screen moved
we play this on these big screens at the conferences you know
this trumpet music blasting out
every time i see it it gets me
he glances over at the iraqi man who is holding a dressing to the cut on his forehead pale and shaken
you a businessman sir
the iraqi man nods
yeah ali babas have been targeting locals lately
holding out his hand todd nixon army small business office
ask me what business im in muhammad
what business are you in sir
right now im in the quality of life business
nixon nods smiling pleased with the line
to bob weve got million iraqis out here who wanna be independent wanna make something of their lives
but more than anything else they wanna buy stuff
cell phones digital cameras leisure suits you name it
if it sells in boston then we can damn well sell it in baghdad
to mahmud am i right muhammad
to bob he knows what im talking about
weve got halliburton parsons perini
just in the primes
were gonna have macdonalds were gonna have starbucks
no corporate tax
its a gold rush
oh and by the way fuck the french
laughing did you hear that shit
chirac wants to bring french contractors in
can you believe that
raise one hand if you like the french
their double act raise both your hands if you are french
he raises both his hands
watch the wheel phil
to bob year zero boys
bob nods politely
lyn prepares an injection for himself
he feels the security guard beside him watching
he notices the name of the company on the mans badge krom security
making conversation whats krom
the security guard continues to watch him through his mirrored shades
texan accent god of war
is that norse
conan the barbarian
sin the movie
lyn injects himself
lyn notices the chilean security guard on his other side has a tattoo on his arm viva pinochet
were in indian country
the suvs are approaching a town and other cars have appeared on the road
the security men on either side instantly lean out of their windows with their m s aiming them at the cars which swerve out of their way in fear
to bob i was pretty down for a while about not getting any trigger time in this war bob but you know what ive learnt
our greatest weapon against evil is commerce
when these people have quality consumer items they will no longer want to kill americans
he turns to gaze at the town they are now driving into
were not gonna rest until theres a satellite dish on every one of roofs
behind him the sound of cars braking and swerving continues
a long line of cars are waiting for gas iraqi men women and children suffering in the heat
many of them have been there for hours
the suvs approach
the driver of the first suv radios nixons car
over radio weve got a line for the gas station here
are we waiting
into radio negative
wed be way too exposed
were taking the station
go in fangs out
as the two suvs roar up horns blaring m s bristling from the windows
the lead suv rams the car at the head of the line and sweeps it out of its path
nixons suv barrels through the gap and screeches to a halt by the pumps
the three security men roll out showily machine guns ready
secure the perimeter
the men fan out to the corners of the station while the first suv blocks the road and more security pile out guns raised to cover the line of cars
there are howls of protest from the waiting iraqis
inside the suv bob lyn and mahmud watch in astonishment
give her the go juice eddy
i filled her up last time
cheerfully out of the window he did fill her up last time gary
with respect sir bull fucking shit
i tanked her last time
can we get some sort of fucking system so we dont
we hear a sudden sharp popping sound
immediately the men drop into crouches scanning the area
weve got contact
he opens fire immediate chaos people scream duck down some cars reverse desperately and collide with the cars behind
the other security men join in the shooting
wheres the shooter
another suv identical but black is passing hemmed in by traffic
a stray bullet from the gas station pings off its armor plating
immediately it screeches to a halt and a new detachment of security men roll from the car same flak jackets and oakley sunglasses but different color uniforms
into radio contact
were under fire
the new detachment open fire blindly in the general direction of the station
as bullets smack off the parked suv
all the security men turns and begin spraying bullets across the road
car windshields and windows explode
a scowling nixon has slid low in his seat
trying to help you fucking savages
mahmud bob and lyn are lying flat on the seats
my house is not far
we could walk from here
bob flinches as another bullet ricochets off the suv
sounds good muhammad
as machine gun fire from across the street strafes the station and nixons security men return fire blindly
yelling into radio krom one this is freedom frontier
we are under attack
this is a fubar situation
behind him lyn bob and mahmud crawl across the station on their hands and knees bullets zipping past them
mahmud leads bob and lyn at a crouching run down the street amongst the crowd of iraqis fleeing the gunfire behind them
we hear the whup whup of a helicopter as a kiowa warrior passes over head
moments later we hear an explosion as the helicopter opens fire with a missile
tracking along a wall past a crooked wedding portrait a smiling mahmud and wife the glass broken
muhammad led us to his home which it turned out had been robbed in his absence
we track past a row of bullet holes in the wall a section of smoke damaged wall paper
and also accidentally set on fire by a us tank
neighbors told him his wife had left they werent sure where she had gone
we reach bob lyn and mahmud eating at a low table
the windows behind them have been partially boarded up
mahmud is sunk into a profound depression
lyn looks tired pale
they eat in awkward silence
what is this
theyre really good
bob nods politely
mahmud nods sighs
i understood he was going through a lot but considering we had saved him from kidnappers i still thought his welcome could have been a little warmer
lyn clears his throat
im very sorry for running you over sir
it was an accident
and i apologize for that security detachment
please dont think all americans are like that
i apologize for the kidnappers
lyn demurs softly
not your fault sir
i mean we get kidnappers in america too so
theres always uh bad apples right
the men eat in silence for a moment
mahmud stares blankly at his plate looking crumpled and lost
bob watches him faintly irritated
lyn tries to think of something comforting to say
akhir il ahzan
may this be the last of your sorrows
mahmud looks at him startled perhaps by the unexpected arabic phrase
did i say it wrong
mahmud shakes his head moved but embarrassed
that was right
they eat in silence
lyn and bob are sharing a bed
bob looks out of the window and notices a cloud over the moon
he concentrates on it trying to bust it
he sighs looks over to lyn who is staring at the wall lost once more in dark thoughts
what are you thinking
people try to build something of their lives something lasting something good
but theres always someone wants to smash it up
lyn was thinking of larry hooper and the part he had played in the destruction of the new earth army
but in fairness the jedis own eccentricities hadnt exactly won them many allies in the army
a jedi tim kootz lies on the couch in a trance bill sitting beside him with pen and paper
for example there was tim kootz who on being asked to ascertain the whereabouts of general manuel noriega had replied
tim jerks awake from his trance
ask angela lansbury
whats that tim
ask angela lansbury
bill looks up to an cia agent observing from the next room
the agent frowns
bill waits a little anxiously
the cia agent walks up to him
we asked angela lansbury
she said she didnt know where general noriega was
major general jack gilling is being driven through the base
as he stares out of the window his expression suddenly changes to one of amazement
or there was the time major general gilling was visiting the base and saw jedi trainee clifford hickox
v we are driving past the training course
a bare chested long haired hickox is dancing around a wooden pole to which he is attached by two long wires and metal hooks which are stuck in his bleeding
practising the ancient sun dance of the sioux nation
bill is introducing a young fresh faced recruit lieutenant norm pendleton to the other jedis
the jedis survived such minor scandals protected it was rumored by a president who was a fan of both the star wars films and the paranormal himself
but then one summer a young likeable lieutenant called norman pendleton was recruited to the new earth army
larry hooper examines the new recruit with interest
larry and norm are jogging together deep in conversation
larry hooper wasted no time befriending the newcomer
desperate to compete with lyn larry had been doing research into the infamous cia mk ultra experiments which he believed could enhance his own psychic powers
norm sits on the couch smiling innocently as larry wheels an electronic device on wheels over to the couch
all he needed was a lab rat to try them out on check if they were safe
larry making sure norm cant see is pouring a massive dose of lsd into a drink
he gives the glass a quick stir and turns smiling to norm with it
norm lies tripping on the couch rigid wide eyed wearing headphones connected to the electronic device which emit disturbing electronic frequencies
larry stands at the light switch turning the red bulb overhead on and off eagerly watching norms reaction a modern day frankenstein
it turned out they werent
cowering terrified under the couch as the sound of gunshots fill the room
norms naked legs stride past him
a naked and demented norm walks through the base firing random shots at scattering soldiers with his beretta
he finds bill blocking his way
give me the gun norm
norm starts to cry
then he puts the gun into his mouth
norms father major general pendleton stares fixedly to where bill and brigadier general hopgood sit in the hearing his expression filled with icy rage
norms father who it turned out was pretty high up in the pentagon wanted blood
although the jedis were pretty sure larry was responsible nothing could be proved and when he was called to the disciplinary hearing larry made sure to smear bill with everything
looking every inch the neat professional soldier
lieutenant colonel django used funds from the projects black budget to procure prostitutes
the officials listening register shock and dismay
bill stands up outraged
thats a lie
and also drugs for himself and his men
bill jumps to his feet again
catches himself well the hooker thing is definitely a lie
the officials look at him as if he were satan himself
brigadier general hopgood resigned and died some years later
bill received a dishonorable discharge
bill a broken man is walking off the base
he reaches the gates and sees lyn waiting for him
continue the work lyn
the world needs the jedis now more than ever
lyn cant speak
bill hugs him and walks off the gates closing after him
the jedis sit having their hair shaved with electric clippers
the jedis new commander major holtz not a shred of new age sympathy in his regulation heart walks down the line examining his men coldly
after bill left major holtz of special forces took command of the jedis
lyn stares at his reflection as his long hair falls to the floor
and nothing was ever the same again
bob wakes up listening to the sound of lyns laboured breathing
across the room lyn sits sweating with pain preparing an injection
we see he has used the last of the medicine
he injects himself his breathing beginning to ease and sits staring at the empty vial
bob watches for a moment then shuts his eyes feigning sleep
lyn and bob are waiting on the quiet road which is studded with burnt out cars
mahmud drives an old renault out of a warehouse and over to them
he gets out the car and hands lyn the keys
i really appreciate this sir
lyn watches mahmud in the mirror as they drive away
he stands in the middle of the road staring at his feet
they drive on
as the car cuts across the landscape
the car has pulled over at a junction
lyn sits staring out at the emptiness looking perhaps for the first time worried
we coulda bought a map if youd said
bedouins have been navigating this desert for centuries without maps
you can use a wrist watch in conjunction with the sun
use your watch
i havent got a watch
oh for the love of
he gives lyn his watch
lyn looks at the watch and turns to stare at bob
this is a digital watch bob
so you need a watch with hands for christs sake
well how the hell am i supposed to know
youre the navigation expert here
you told me you could find the way
will if youd just be quiet for a
turns out you havent even got a watch
now what the hell are we
will you shut up
i dont need a watch
im using level two
we were trained to make correct decisions
somebody runs up to you and says theres a fork in the road
do we turn left or do we turn right
and you go
snapping his fingers we go right
bob stares at him
snapping his fingers just like that
lyn abruptly starts the engine and takes the right turn
oh its that way
its this way
now you know
below us the car drives off into the empty landscape getting smaller and smaller
we see the flash of the explosion and the renault is flipped like a toy car
a ribbon of black smoke rises into the blue sky
v we are stumbling forward towards a sand berm
we hear the sound of heavy breathing
lyn is staggering over the sand with bob on his back
he is holding his backpack
bob has a gash on his forehead which is bleeding
under the blood his face is white
in the distance behind them we can see the column of black smoke rising
improvised explosive device
youre okay bob
its gonna be okay
i cant believe this
great fucking intuition lyn
put me down
i can walk
put me down
lyn puts bob down
bob keels sideways onto the sand and lies there wheezing
he hauls bob to his feet puts his baseball cap on him and pulls him onto his back
bob hangs there limply as lyn sets off again
lyn reaches up and gropes at bobs face removing his spectacles
bob doesnt notice
where are we going
we should stay with the car so the army can find us
fedayeen will find us first
well i disagree
i totally disagree
beat the federal what
fellas who probably laid the ied
they could be on their way now
hold this bob
he passes bob his backpack
they stagger on in silence for a moment bob jogging up and down on lyns back
lyn snaps the legs off bobs glasses uses them as improvised divining rods to scan the sand ahead
what are you doing
could be ieds or mines around here
im checking for disturbances in the telluric current
still dazed are they my glasses
lyn doesnt answer keeps on walking struggling a little under the weight
jesus its hot
im so hot
beat arent you hot
not unkindly bob
its pretty important you keep your mouth closed okay
you can lose a lot of water through an open mouth
he staggers on with him
bob trails after lyn his shirt tied around his head breathing hard
lyn is still scanning the sand
i cant breathe properly
he staggers manages not to fall
i think im bleeding to death
youre not bleeding to death bob
its shock okay
its just the shock
youre gonna be okay
if wed stayed at the road we would be safe now
now weve got no water no food or or
noticing lyns scanning will you forget about the fucking tantric currents
youre going to be okay
stop saying that
i just got blown up
im in the middle of a desert
bob youre suffering from shock
if you start panicking now your hearts gonna stop
bob stares after him incredulously
losing it is that
is that supposed to calm me down
hurrying after him you know what color the seats were in the frigging hotel but you cant
you wanna observe something lyn
observe the fucking bomb in the middle of the road
lyn walks on without answering
bob notices the sun is sinking
wait a minute
al qaims in that direction
were going the wrong way
the mission isnt in al qaim
its somewhere near al qaim
i dont know
is that a joke
weve come six hundred miles and you dont know where were going
if the exact whereabouts of the target was known it wouldnt take a jedi to find them would it
bob watches lyn stare around him looking pale and drawn and for the first time afraid
who gave you the mission lyn
he appeared in my trailer two months ago
a psychic projection
i could hear him calling my name
bob is so staggered by this for a moment he cant speak
he needed me
oh jesus lyn
theres no mission
were in the middle of the desert because you heard voices
theres no one here
theres no one fucking here
lyn starts to walk off but staggers and falls
bob rushes to him kneels beside him
lyn clutches his stomach grimaces
is it the crohns
i dont have crohns
whats the matter with you
bob stares at him stunned
ive been murdered
lyn sits staring up at the immense moon above them
bob sits watching huddled against the cold in the shelter of some rocks
lyn gets up stumbles back over to him and lies down struggling for breath white with pain
its gone bob
i cant find him
ive lost my power
its the curse
with profound they took this
beautiful thing wed been building and they corrupted it
they destroyed the new earth army
who destroyed it
lyn stares at the stars above remembering grief stricken
the jedis now indistinguishable from other soldiers stand white washing over the cosmic murals
major holtz stands watching
yoga is not the business of the us army ladies
drumming circles are not the business of the army
and love and peace is most certainly not the business of the army
so you girls better start thinking about how you can engage in the business of the united states army which in case you have forgotten involves winning fucking wars
when the dust of the pendleton affair had settled it revealed a surprising victor
larry stands to attention in front of holtz a report held under one arm
major holtz regarded larry hooper as a patriotic whistle blower and the one sound fruit in an otherwise dubious barrel of apples
its some scientific research ive done for possible offensive psi applications sir
beat i did show the report to lieutenant colonel django but he didnt seem interested
holtz snorts angrily
i bet he wasnt
he takes the report and begins to look through it
he looks up slowly at larry
we have men who can do this
a sly smile i think i know one sir
holtz ponders the report tempted
but we dont have the resources
there is goat lab
the building we saw at the top of the film
a hundred goats stare silently at us
goat lab was originally created as a clandestine laboratory to provide in the field surgical training for special forces soldiers
we boom down to reveal that many of the goats have their legs in plaster
the goats would get shot in the leg with a bolt gun and then a trainee would have to dress the wound successfully
goat lab actually used to be called dog lab
with big brown eyes
but it turned out most soldiers didnt feel good shooting dogs in the leg
a soldier stares doubtfully down at the dog bolt gun in hand
a goat stands tethered in the desert
titles read nevada test site frenchman flat
whereas the army had long felt fine about doing stuff to goats even testing atomic weapons on them
we hear the drone of an aeroplane high high above
the goat looks up
lyn stands facing the goats
holtz and hooper watch him
one of the goats stares back
the goat stares back
and the goat falls over
the goat gets back up shakes itself and walks off
bob listens transfixed
this was the real deal bob
i was at the gateway
afterwards i realized id got injured
sympathetic injury i guess
i was bruised all over
so its not that the goat fought back
goat didnt have a chance
that was it
i wish it was
hooper told holtz we should try the experiment again
only this time they said
kill the goat
six goats each wearing a numbered bib stand in a small bare room
a soldier is setting up a video camera in front of them
lyn sits in another bare room
holtz and larry hooper stand watching him
lyn is also being taped
a soldier walks in carrying an envelope
holtz takes the envelope and draws from it a piece of paper
he shows it to lyn the number four
take out number four
lyn stares at the number
lyn said he had no intention of killing the goat
lyn flushes with indignation at the memory
there was no way
what had the goat ever done to me
it was totally against the way of the jedi
i was just going to pretend to try so they would say okay it cant be done and forget about it
but then as i sat there i felt this this pulse start inside of me and
i couldnt stop it
he turns to look at bob haunted
you know what i keep thinking
as he stares concentrating
maybe deep down inside some dark part of me wanted to see if i could do it
grainy flickering black and white footage of the six goats in the room
suddenly one of them goes down
a soldier runs into the room
holtz hooper and lyn turn to him the atmosphere electric with dread and anticipation
the goat is dead
the three men stare at him
goat number four
bob stares at lyn aghast
eyes glistening collateral damage
beat that was it
id used my powers for evil and it was like i brought a curse upon us all
like that poem where the guy kills the seagull and they make him wear it round his neck
every night id dream of that goat in its little bib its mouth opening and closing but nothing coming out
bob shakes his head stares out into the darkness
the silence of the goats
lyn flicks a suspicious glance at bob but is reassured by his solemn expression
i finished my tour and i quit
i walked out of the unit and i never went back
lyn wearing civilian clothes and holding a suitcase is walking off the base
he reaches the gates and turns for one last look at the place that has been his home
but before he could leave larry arranged one last parting gift
lyn tuns back to the gates and finds larry hooper standing in front of him looking wired
what do you wan
before he can finish larry chops his hand down in an odd blow onto lyns forehead
lyn staggers back a little holding his head
what the hell
larry has already darted around him with a crazy laugh and is running madly back into the base
lyn stares after him stunned
it was the dim mak
bob looks at lyn puzzled
the dim mak
the dim mak
the quivering palm
the death touch
its like this legendary martial arts move
it was forbidden in the new earth army
larry had got it from a mail order book
what does the death touch do
beat patiently it kills you bob
with one touch
theres a story that wong wifu great chinese martial artist had a fight with some guy and had him beat when the guy gave him this light tap and wong
looked at him and the guy just nodded
that was it
hed given him the death touch and wong died
then and there
eighteen years later
thats the weird thing with dim mak you never know when its going to take effect
he flops back too tired to talk anymore
bob watches him as he falls asleep
the same horizon the dunes now burning under the sun
we track back and find bob and lyn lying asleep lips cracked dehydrated exhausted
faintly we hear a sound a tinny bell
it gets closer
groggily bob opens his eyes just as a goat walks into the frame and walks past him the bell tied around its neck
bob lies watching it pass trying to work out if its a hallucination
he struggles to his feet and sets off up the berm hes been lying at the foot of
the goat walks on ahead of bob crests the top of the berm and disappears from sight
bob reaches the top of the berm and stands swaying staring down at something
close on bobs face stunned
bob is dragging a barely conscious lyn up the berm following the goat
he staggers barely able to put one foot in front of the other
at last we crest the top of the berm and find ourselves looking down on a water hole fringed with palms
the goat stands drinking
it stops to look up at us
bob and lyn collapse into the wet mud of the hole
bob manages to cup some water into lyns mouth and then his own
he rolls onto his back stares up at the burning sky
we hear a dull roaring muffled growing in volume
a helicopter is approaching
in the black we hear a voice
in arabic in america if i do not like my cell phone company i change them
i am in charge
this is consumer power
overhead shot lyn and bob lie side by side in beds both hooked up to ivs
sunlight slants through the shutters on the window in the cool room
the voice is coming from a speaker on the wall
this is democracy
let us work together for that
and please stop shooting at those who are only here to help
lyn opens his eyes looks around him
this is an old one from cat stevens
correcting himself yusef islam
thats yusef islam
lyn looks at the door and for a second theres a flash of a face staring in through the glass
then its gone
over the speaker comes the sound of a period song
lyn sits up staring at the door
bob stirs in his bed
lyn walks unsteadily out of the room towing his iv drip behind him
the door at the end of the corridor is just closing
lyn sets off down the corridor
bob appears in the doorway behind him towing his own iv
where are you going
lyn passes doors glances into the rooms beyond
v the room seems to house a printing press
a soldier stands with his back to us watching leaflets fire out of the press
we pass to the next room which seems to be a recording studio the walls covered in shelves of cds
a soldier sits with headphones on playing an electronic keyboard
lyn emerges blinking into the light
he stares around him
the song is playing over speakers echoing eerily around the base
a door slides shut with a clang nearby and lyn turns to locate the sound
a trail of footprints leads across the sand to a hangar nearby
lyn heads off across the sand dragging the iv
bob emerges behind him
lyn reaches the sliding doors of the building and drags them open and stands staring into the gloomy interior
bob catches him up
i dont think we should
he stops following lyns gaze
the place is full of goats
lyn and bob stare at the animals
slowly lyn advances into the darkness peering around him
in the shadows at the back of the building a figure stirs
lyn walks slowly forward until he can make out the man old bearded worn and wasted by years of heavy drinking
its bill django
lyn stares at him
bill smiles hesitantly
lyn is too choked with emotion for a moment to answer
this is bob
bob is too amazed to reply
bob and lyn turn to find larry hooper standing in the doorway behind them
the gangs all here
lyn stares at larry shocked
larry and bill are showing bob and lyn around
a few civilian workers are working at computers behind them
this is primarily a psyops base
psy for psychic
psy for psychological although the irony isnt wasted on me
radio broadcasts leaflets that sort of thing
bob picks up a leaflet
oh thats an iraqi psyops leaflet they dropped on us
american soldier your wives are back home having sex with bart simpson and bert reynolds
yeah hadnt exactly done their homework there
lyn is staring at bill who is looking a little vacantly at the racks of cds
howd you find us lyn
i remote viewed you
larry smiles a little mockingly
if this is psyops what are you doing here
i said primarily psyops
this is a restricted area you understand
everything you hear and see stays secret or you go to prison
bob nods a little nervously
there are individuals in the current administration who are looking for
creative solutions for the war on terror
theyre far more open minded then their predecessors and theyve out sourced experimental research to my company
he indicates the psic name badge hes wearing
its pronounced psi ike
psychic systems international corp
turns out certain people had heard about the new earth army and were interested in some of the work we were doing back then
they got in touch with me i got in touch with bill
to bill youre working for him
bill frowns at the cds not seeming to hear
bills been looking into subliminal messaging
selecting a disc this is one weve designed to play to our own troops before combat
he puts the disc in a player and presses play
we hear a burst of a period song
theres a subliminal message in this
reading the cd this is
dont get drunk before firing heavy machine guns
weve got all sort of products in development
to worker tell them one of our new ideas
air bag mine
air bag mine
non lethal mine catapults the fucker up into air
to another gimme another one
blast target with pheromones and then release attack bees
the forces of nature
we mutilate enemy corpses and
were not doing that anymore
throwing an eraser at the worker idiot
he turns back to lyn
the point is weve got a budget weve got supporters
im rebuilding the new earth army
only this time without the hippy crap
bill stands up and starts walking a little unsteadily towards the door
you okay bill
without turning gonna get some ice cream
larry waits until bill has left before turning back to lyn
you get the odd flash of what he used to be but
hes pretty burnt out with the booze
larry shakes his head in apparent sorrow
then he notices some candy on a desk
he picks it up and starts to eat it
to lyn you want one
lyn shakes his head trying not to show the emotions he is feeling
watching him god i love these things
bob helps lyn down the corridor
lyn suddenly stops listening
there is a faint sound of music coming from somewhere nearby
lyn walks down the corridor bob following
at the end of the corridor is a single door with a spy hole
the loud music is coming from there
we can hear now that it is an annoying childrens show song or heavy metal
we track towards the door
lyn hesitates then slides back the spy hole cover and peers in
an iraqi prisoner sits huddled in the cell illuminated in the flashes of a powerful strobe light overhead
lyrics from chosen song
the prisoner looks terrified and despite the whimsical music the whole scene is horribly sinister
lyn steps away from the spy hole
what is it
its the dark side
lyn sits on his bed as low as weve ever seen him
bob watches him concerned
what are you going to do
lyn stares at the wall
what are you going to do
its too late
im dying bob
oh youre not dying
i dont believe you can kill someone with a mail order dim sum
i dont believe you can just
just tap someone and it
i mean i know it was caused by the dim mak
thats what the doctors say
different ways of looking at
different names for a reality or or uh
he lapses into silence
bob is stunned
lyn lies down
i shouldnt have come bob
shouldnt have come
lyn pulls the eagle feather from the chain around his neck
give this back to bill
i dont deserve it
bob stares at him
bill django sits cross legged in the sand drinking from a bottle of whiskey watching the sun set
bob marches up to him stands awkward but determined
i think you should go and see lyn sir
beat he needs you
bill doesnt answer
the man crossed a desert to see you again
bill takes a long drink stares at the sky
bob watches him with mounting frustration
you know he told me all these stories about bill django and i was pretty excited to meet you but ive gotta tell you
youre one big disappointment
bill doesnt react
bob starts to walk away then turns back and throws the feather down at bills feet
he told me to give you that back
i dont know why
its supposed to be a mark of honour isnt it
i dont see how you deserve that
bill turns to look at bob for the first time
he takes a long drink
it isnt real
twenty thousand dollar fine for taking an eagle feather
this ones off a turkey
you just die the tip black
beat dont tell lyn
bill stares at the feather
none of it was real
that isnt true
that isnt true
he looks around for inspiration notices a lone cloud floating in the sky
bob places his fingers on his temples and stares at the cloud focuses desperate hopeful
bill notices and watches curious
slowly the cloud fades and disappears
bob cant believe it
he looks at bill who is staring at him
he has tears in his eyes
lyn lies sleeping
larry sits at the foot of his bed smoking a cigar
he watches lyn for a moment then coughs deliberately
he repeats the cough louder
didnt mean to wake you
the two men stare at each other
heard you werent feeling well
howd you find us
i told you
i remote viewed you
scotty mercer told you didnt he
yeah he did
we told scotty we were coming over here asked him if he wanted some work
i havent seen scotty
thats funny because he told me hed run into you and mentioned that there might be some jobs going with us over here
beat isnt that why you came really lyn
you want back in dont you
lyn stares at him disturbed afraid this might be true
it can happen
youve only got to say the word
could be the new golden age for psi research
you me and bill back together again
just like the old days
larry closes his eyes trying to remember something
mother earth my life support system
as a soldier i must drink your blue water live inside your red clay and eat your green skin
lyn listens moved despite himself
bill and bob stand on a picnic table under the full moon
bill is leading bob through some yoga positions
both are drunk
i pray my boots will always kiss your face and my footsteps match your heartbeat
lyn cant help but join in the prayer
carry my body through space and time
you are my connection to the universe
bill and bob both stand in a difficult position balanced on one leg
and all that comes after
i am yours and you are mine
as we watch bill slowly topples forward off the table and crashes out of sight below
the two men finish the prayer
i salute you
dont make a decision now
tell me in the morning
he pats lyns leg walks out
bob is holding a concussed bill who has a cut on his head
bill are you okay
bill opens his eyes suddenly
i just saw timothy leary
timothy learys dead
hes had an idea
bill and bob head down the corridor
they pass a soldier
good evening sir
getting some ice cream
they walk on and reach the doors to the kitchens
the two men hesitate look at each other
then bob walks in
psic workers and psyops troops are all eating breakfast together talking laughing
bob and bill sit drinking coffee
lyn appears with a tray and sits down beside bob
they eat in silence for a moment
lyn turns to look out of the window to where larry hooper stands outside in the early morning sun smoking a cigar and drinking coffee
he turns and notices lyn raises his cup smiles
lyn looks troubled
bob suddenly leans into lyn
dont eat the jello
lyn turns to bob puzzled
dont eat the jello
lyn tries to puzzle this out but is distracted by larry outside who seems to have noticed something in the sand at his feet a small insect of some kind
he begins to watch it with strange fascination
after a moment he sinks to his knees in order to get a better look at it
one of the soldiers notices and starts to laugh softly
his neighbor looks at him as if hes crazy then begins to laugh himself
lyn looks around him sensing the strange atmosphere creeping through the room
whats going on
we put lsd in the jello
lyn turns to stare at him
bill showed me where larry had bottles of lsd
so we put it in the jello mix last night
and in the water
bob turns to stare at him
i put it in the main water tank as well
bob stares at him aghast
weve drunk the water
he pours himself another coffee
into microphone the weather
the weather is going to be hot
through the window we see larry get on his belly to get a better look at the bug
the dj soldier has gone off script
a producer is trying ineffectually to pull him away from the desk
into microphone im guessing
i mean i havent looked at the the thing but id say its going to be fucking hot
the producer pulls and releases the djs headphones so they slap against his head and starts giggling
that hurt greg you fucking dip shit
laughing too you fuckity fuck dip shit fuck hole
remembering something hey
he hits a button
close on a loudspeaker blasting a period song out over the base
we boom down to where two soldiers are dancing tripping
soldiers are wandering around talking some falling to their knees weak with laughter
some stand alone staring with a beatific smile at the sky
as the music plays on a stryker armored vehicle drives around the corner of a building a soldier standing up arms raised in the gun turret
the stryker screeches into a clumsy skid the soldier having to hang on
the stryker roars off again heading straight for the gates of the base
calling down into the vehicle youre going to hit the gates
youre going to hit the gates
the stryker veers left and smashes through the perimeter fence and out into the desert
you missed them
the dj and the producer are wrestling over the sound desk laughing
bob and bill walk towards the cell block
dont you think it might have been more sensible if we hadnt drunk the fucking water
that might have aroused suspicion
but dont worry
over the years i have built up a massive tolerance to all narcotics
an iraqi prisoner looks up startled as the door to the cell is flung open and bill stands filling the doorway bare chested wild eyed and wild haired
in the name of the new earth army and loving people everywhere im liberating this base
lyn slides open the door to the shed and begins to shoo the goats out into the light
as the music continues bob lyn and bill appear leading a column of nervous iraqi prisoners out of the building towards the gates
lyn and bill are holding baby goats in their arms
a tripping bob is holding bunches of flowers its as close as they can get to the illustration from the new earth army manual
lyn holds up a hand to stop the procession
larry stands in front of them a gun in his hand his face blank
lyn and larry stare at each other
then unexpectedly larry starts to cry
give me the gun larry
larry starts to raise the gun to his mouth
scratches his head
he wanders off
over loudspeaker hey
muffled get off will ya
over the loud speakers we hear the opening of a period song
beat relieved okay lets go
bob and lyn stand at one side bill at the other beckoning the prisoners through hugging the prisoners as they pass through
were very sorry
one by one the iraqis walk out through the broken fence staring around them suspiciously expecting a trap
nothing happens no one shoots them
the iraqis start to hurry away over the sand
beyond them we can the stryker driving in circles in the desert a naked soldier stands whooping on top
bob tripping heavily is staring with fascination at the sand trickling through his fingers
suddenly we hear the building whine of the helicopter engine starting up
bob looks up puzzled
bill and lyn sit in the chopper bill at the controls
lyn is holding the flowers
bob appears hurrying over
wait for me
where are you going
what about the mission
over the sound of the engine you are the mission bob
you are the mission
tell them what happened
the helicopter begins to rise
bob stands swaying staring up
lyn smiles sadly through the window raises his hand
the helicopter rises higher and higher
bob waves goodbye
at the time i was hurt that lyn hadnt taken me with him
but now i know it was because he and bill had already seen what was to come
as the helicopter flies off into the blue
nobody knows exactly what happened
the official story is that their helicopter must have crashed either because they were hit by an rpg or because
well thats what happens when you fly a helicopter while youre tripping on acid
all i know is theyve never been seen since
like all shaman they returned to the sky
the helicopter disappears altogether
bob sits typing frowning with concentration
when i got back home i wrote the story up
bob sits in his car staring at his old home across the road
through the window we can see bobs ex wife debora eating dinner with bobs ex editor dave
i sent it to the newspapers the radio stations the tv stations because that was what lyn wanted me to do
the people needed to know
bob sits watching a today style show on tv
i was ready for whatever they would do to me
i was ready to disappear
i was ready to go to prison
i was a jedi and i was fighting for the new earth army
beat but they didnt put me in prison
they did something much worse
and finally us forces in iraq are using what some are calling a cruel and unusual tool to break the resistance of iraqi pows and many parents would agree
some prisoners are being forced to listen to barney the purple dinosaur sing the i love you song
i think after an hour of that theyll spill the beans
lets go outside to al for the weather
bob watches ashen
bob is working for another small town newspaper
he sits at his desk staring fixedly ahead at the wall
that was it
that was the only bit of my story that ran anywhere
and it was a joke
and if i ever needed proof of how the dark side have taken the beautiful dream of what a nation could be and had twisted it destroyed it that was
bob stands up
he starts to walk down the office his face set with grim determination
but i wont stop
i wont give up
bob quickens his pace
because when i look at what is happening in the world i know that now more than ever we need to become all that we can be
bob is running
now more than ever we need the supermen
bob rushes towards the wall
just as he is about to hit it we freeze frame
we hear the opening of a period song
