screenplay by kevin smith a long time ago in front of a convenience store far far away we fade in on the block of stores quick stop rst from sometime
ago in fact rst isnt rst its the record rack a s store with head shop paraphernalia in the window
a white trash mother maybe seventeen wearing a baseball cap comes into frame carrying a chubby baby
the baby wears an oversized t shirt under what looks like a little bathrobe and messily eats a chocolate bar
there are food stamps in the mothers hands
bobby boy stay here while mommy picks up the free cheese kay
she looks up at the bright sun shielding her eyes slightly then looks back at the baby on the ground
she takes off her baseball cap and places it on the baby
thisll keep the sun out of your eyes
you be good now
she walks away leaving the baby sitting against the wall
with the backwards baseball cap and the chocolate around his mouth forming something that resembles a beard the kid looks kind of familiar
then another mother also very young decked out in a kiss concert shirt from years gone by and huge feathered hair enters with a black skullcap wearing baby slung at
she sees the first baby sitting against the wall and sets her baby down beside him
dont fucking move you little shit machine

a passerby enters heading toward the convenience store
he takes note of the babies and the mother heading into the record store and then stops and addresses her disgusted

jay bends down to pull up his pants and farts
silent bob cracks up
the cop grabs them both leading them toward the car
lets take a ride down to the station
its suddenly a crime to fart motherfucker
an establishing shot of brodies store in the heart of red bank
no fucking way
we go tight on the huge cartoon sign of brodie outside to brodie himself holding a stack of comics in one hand and a dixie cup in the other jay
and silent bob follow him as he puts new books in the racks
dante and randal slapped you with a restraining order
judge said if we go within a hundred feet of the stores we get thrown into county
so you gonna abide by the courts ruling or you gonna go bandit reynolds style
you know what they make you do in county
toss the fucking salad
i dont like this fucks asshole im gonna do it for some stranger
i guess if you really wanted to hang out in from of a convenience store you could just buy your own now what with all that money you guys made
hell yeah bitch
beat wait a second what money
the money from the movie dumb ass
what the fuck are you babbling about
pulling a bagged and boarded issue down from the wall the bluntman and chronic movie
dawns on him oh my god dont tell me you have no idea theres a movie being made of the comic you two were the basis for
goddamit man taps his wrist heres the pulse alright
and heres your finger shoves his hand down the back of his pants far from the pulse jammed straight up your ass
extracts hand and extends it to jay say would you like a chocolate covered pretzel
brodie leads them back to the counter
you see kids if you read wizard youd know its the top story this month
check it out
brodie hands jay and silent bob a copy of wizard opened to the headline snootchie bootchies
bluntman and chronic get big screen treatment
there are pictures of holden mcneil and banky edwards as well as drawings of bluntman and chronic
when the fuck did this happen
well after x men hit at the box office all the studios started buying up every comic property they could get their hands on
miramax optioned bluntman and chronic
i thought they only made classy flicks like the piano and the crying game
yeah well once they made shes all that everything went to hell
so youre saying you havent gotten a cut of the movie
didnt holden mcneil and banky edwards used to pay you likeness rights for the comic book
we havent seen a fucking dime for no movie
well boys im no lawyer but i think holden and banky owe you some of the proverbial phat cash
i mean theyre making a movie based on characters that are based on you and quiet robert
it aint me and quiet robert
its a pair of stupid ass superheroes that run around saying snitchy nitchies or something
i believe it snootchie boochies
regardless youre getting screwed
if i was you guys id confront holden mcneil and ask him for my movie check
we gotsa get paid
and on that note we cue the music
jay lays down a house bass beat
brodie complements it with his own beat
jay and silent bob mosey past the front door of the building and knock
holden mcneil opens the door and smiles
i have been waiting years to do this
smiles look at these morose motherfuckers right here
smells like someone shit in their cereal
jay and silent bob enter
holden closes the door following them
what the fuck took you so long answering your damn door
you trying to talk another girlfriend of yours into some of that gay ass three way action with your buddy
no i was just showering your mothers stink off me after i gave her a quick jump and sent her home
but now that you mention it to bob thanks you know
you couldve made the moral of that story you told me a bit more clear
silent bob shrugs
so what brings you two dirt merchants to my neck of the woods
oh ill tell you what our necks are doing in your woods silent bob holds up the wizard article
wheres our motherfucking movie check
you heard about that too hunh
well ive got nothing to do with it
thats bankys deal
he owns the property now
i signed my half of the bluntman and chronic right over to him years ago
why the fuck would you do a thing like that
because im almost thirty for gods sake why on earth would i want to keep writing about characters whose central preoccupations are weed and dick and fart jokes
you gotta grow man
dont you ever want more for yourself
off silent bob i know this poor hapless sonovabitch does
i look in his doe eyes and i see a man crying out when lord
when the fuck can your servant ditch this foul mouthed little chucklehead to whom i am a constant victim of his folly and who bombards me and those around us
with grade a foolishness that prevents me from even getting to kiss a girl
silent bob nod like hes finally understood
jay looks at him hurt and bob tried to downplay the comments truth
im the chucklehead
fuck you youre the dumb ass who gave away his comic and now you aint got no fat movie check neither
when youre right youre right
i wish id broken off a little piece for myself
because if the buzz is any indication the movies gonna make some huge bank
the internet buzz
what the fuck is the internet
holdens at a computer terminal
jay and silent bob look over his shoulder
the internet is a communication device that allows people the world over to bitch about movies and share pornography with one another
off monitor heres what were looking for movie poopshoot
com to bob poopchute
this is a site full of militant movie buffs sad bastards who live in their parents basements downloading scripts and trading what they believe to be inside info about movies
and actors they despise yet cant stop discussing
this is where you go if you wanna hear frustrated would be filmmakers mouth off with their two bit arm chair directors opinions on how they all couldve made a
better episode one
on the computer monitor we see the site mainpage load up
holden begins navigating the site
this is about the bluntman movie
reading inside sources tell me miramax is starting production this friday on their adaptation of underground comic fave bluntman and chronic
does it say whos playing us in the movie
no but if its miramax im sure itll be ben affleck and matt damon
they putem in a bunch of movies
you know the guys from good will hunting
you mean the fucking movie with mork from ork in it
yeah im not too big a fan either
though affleck was the bomb in phantoms
phantoms like a motherfucker
holden and jay slap hands
holden points at the monitor again
now down here is where you can gauge the buzz
this is the shoot back area
its where people who read the news get to chime in with their two cents
heres what a guy who goes by the chick magnet net handle of wampa one thinks about bluntman and chronic
reading bluntman and chronic and their stupid alter egos jay and silent bob only work in small doses if at all
they dont deserve their own movie
to jay hes got a point
whats the next one say
reading bluntman and chronic is the worst comic i ever read
jay and silent bob are stupid characters
a couple of stoners who spout dumb ass catchphrases like a third rate cheech and chong or bill and ted
fuck jay and silent bob
fuck them up their stupid asses
who the fuck said that shit
a guy who calls himself magnolia fan
check out what the guy after him said jay and silent bob are terrible one note jokes that only stoners laugh at
theyre fucking clown shoes
if they were real id beat the shit out of them for being so stupid
i cant believe miramax would have anything to so with this shit
i for one will be boycotting this movie
whos with me
leans back and then there are about fifty more posts from people who agree to join spartacus heres boycott of the flick
grimly im gonna kill all these fucks ah let it go
number one theyre a bunch of jealous little dicks who use the anonymity of the net to insult people whore doing what they wish they were doing and number two
theyre not really talking about you guys they talking about bluntman and chronic
but they said jay and silent bob
they used our real names
it doesnt matter that theres a comic book version of us and a real version cause nobody knows were real in real life
and all these people who read that shit think the real jay and silent bob are a couple of faggots cause of that all these dicks are writing about the
comic book jay and silent bob
and maybe one night me and lunchboxll be macking some bitch and shell be like oooo
i want to suck youse guys dicks off
whats your names
and ill be like jay and silent bob
and shell be like oh i read on the internet that youse guys were little fucking jerkoffs
and then she goes and sucks two other guyss dicks off instead
well fuck that
we gotta put a stop to these hateful sonsa bitches before they ruin our good names
first off i dont know how good your names really are
secondly theres not much you can do about stopping this bile
the internets given everyone in america a voice and everyone in american has chosen to use that voice to bitch about movies
as long as theres a bluntman and chronic movie the net nerds are gonna have something negative to say about it
jay steams thinking
then a light dawns on him
but wait a second if there wasnt a bluntman and chronic movie then no one would be saying shit about jay and silent bob right
theyre not saying anything about you now theyre talking about fictional characters
oblivious to holden to bob so all we gotta do is stop em from making the movie
yeah and kiss off the hundreds of thousands of dollars in royalties youre due in the process
are you fucking retarded
look im probably not alone in the opinion that this flick is the worst idea since greedo shooting first
i mean a jay and silent bob movie
who would pay to see that
holden jay and silent bob pause and look at the camera for a beat
then but since it is happening you might as well just ignore the idiots on the internet go find banky and get your motherfucking movie check
as you so succinctly put it
thats whats important here
no holden mcneil whats important here is that theres a bunch of motherfuckers we dont even know calling us assholes on the internet to a bunch of teenagers and guys
who cant even get laid
putting a stop to that is the most important thing we could ever do
off monitor when did it say theyre making that movie
they start this friday
so if todays tuesday that gives us counts eight days
its more like three days
three days to stop that stupid fucking movie from getting made
cmon silent bob jay and bob stand and look at each other filled with purpose
were going to hollywood
they stride off
holden shakes his head
now thats what i call the blunt leading the blunt
jay and silent bob approach a bus thats labeled los angeles
they nod at each other and then climb aboard
after a beat they re emerge
since when did they start charging for the bus
they head toward the depot
didnt we used to ride that shit to school every day for free
the bus roars past a sign that read leaving new jersey
jay makes his way up to the driver
we in hollywood yet
its a three day ride to los angeles sir
we left twenty minutes ago
i didnt ask you about los angeles
i asked you about hollywood
hollywoods in los angeles sir
dont change the subject
are we in hollywood yet or not
please sit down sir
jay glares at the driver and heads back to his seat
why dont you take your seat ralph kramden jay slumps into the seat beside silent bob
im fucking bored man
there aint shit to so on this bus
silent bob mimes jerking off
i already did that
silent bob shrugs looking out the window jay looks across the aisle and spots a child in a helmet playing a handheld video game
he leans over to him
yo gretzky lemme get a turn
leave me alone little kid
the child gives him the finger
jay goes wide eyed turning to silent bob
that fuck called me a little kid and gave me the finger
go kick his ass
silent bob offers an incredulous look as if to say hes ten years old
youre my muscle aintcha
silent bob kind of nods
so go open a can of whup ass on that little fuck and get me his game
silent bob sighs and stands
he climbs over jay into the aisle and stands in front of the child
he looks at him and registers doubt
he looks back to jay who waves him on
silent bob steels himself looks back to the kid and reaches for his game
the child emits a high pitched scream and starts punching himself in the head
silent bob dives back into his seat trying to look nonchalant
the child stops crying
jay looks at silent bob
youre one tough motherfucker you know that
the bus pulls over by the side of the road
the bus driver heads down the aisle toward the back of the bus followed by pissed off passengers
they been in there going on half an hour now
two of them
doing god knows what
the bus driver bangs on the bathroom door and shouts
this bus isnt moving another inch unless you clear out of there right now
the bus driver bangs on the door harder
the door handle turns the door swings wide and massive amounts of smoke suddenly billow through the back of the bus
the smoke clears to reveal jay and silent bob squeezed into the bathroom holding a massive joint
um i think somethings burning back here
as the bus pulls away jay and silent bob are revealed left behind
the whole fucking worlds against us dude
i swear to god
silent bob nods
jay sticks out his thumb and starts hitching
jay and bob are walking backwards hitching still
this sucks balls man
how come we aint getting no rides
cause youre doing it all wrong
jay and bob look behind them
theres a guy hitching as well
you gotta induce the drivers a little
the guy holds out his sign to them
it reads will give head for ride
yeah but what happens when you get in the car and you dont make with the head
dont they kick your ass to the curb
sure if you dont make with the head
jay and bob look at him for a long beat
you eat the cock
if itll get me a few hundred miles across country
ill take a shot in the mouth
yeah but we aint gay
well neither am i
but have you seen the price of bus tickets lately
shit i dont wanna cough up two hundred bucks just to get to chicago
well i dont wanna cough up some dudes sperm
dont be so suburban this is the new millennium
gay straight its all the same now
therere no more lines
jay draws a line on the ground with his foot
on this side of it we aint gay
all hitchers do this
why do you think people pick us up
if you get a ride its expected i dont care who the driver is
its the first rule in the book
the unwritten book of the road
a truck starts to pull over to the side of the road
the guy points to it as if to say see
the passenger side door opens
the guy climbs into the truck and closes the door
he looks out the window at jay and bob
follow the rules of the book and youll get where youre going in no time
through the windshield jay and silent bob see the guy go face first into the truck drivers lap
the truck drivers smiles and the truck takes off roaring down the road
jay and silent bob watch the truck disappear
then a car pulls up
the nun driving rolls down the passenger side window and leans toward them
you two boys need a ride
the nun drives smiling
jay and silent bob sit in the back seat huddled close together their eyes glued on the nun
you both dont have to sit back there
one of you can sit up here with me
silent bob shakes his head no to jay
jay shrugs and climbs up front
so where are you boys from
what brings you to indiana
were going to hollywood
thats a long ways away
yeah were lucky you picked us up
well do unto others
thats what the book says
misinterpreting completely wait a minute you follow the book too
i live my life by it
you know how lonely it gets on the road
thanks to the book im never alone if you know what i mean
this guy back there explained it to us
but i didnt think youd be into that
are you kidding
ive dedicated my life to it
every hour of every day
shit you nuns are alright
you live by the book too
you picked us up didnt you
thats good to hear
but it takes deed not words
its a lot easier to say you live by the book than to actually do it
looks at him can you do it
you want me to do it right now
no time like the present right
jay looks back at silent bob
silent bob shakes his head no
jay shrugs them flips his hair over his shoulder and starts to bend down
he suddenly stops you hear that
shes not a catholic
shes a presbyterian
jay disappears below the dash the nun goes wide eyed
the nuns car screeched to the side of the road
jay gets kicked our of the front seat by the screaming nun
silent bob rushes out too and the car races off
jays wipes his mouth
he pulls a long curly hair from between his teeth
dude she had seventies bush
jay and bob continue hitching
i cant believe this shit
five hours and not a single ride
every day millions of people hitch to hollywood and stop studios from making movies about em
but when you and me try it its like were trapped in a fucking cartoon
a familiar looking van pulls up in the other side of the raid the horn beeps
jay and bob look at each other shrug and race across the street get in
the van pulls off
jay and bob sit in the back of the can and stare at a clean cut guy a bookish woman in glasses a red headed beauty a stoner dude and
a great dane
jay looks at silent bob
zoinks yo and now we can finally solve the mystery of the hitchhiking ghouls
pull off their masks and lets see who they really are
i dont think they are masks
i dont think theyre hitchhiking girls either
ghouls you fucking moron
to herself though i wish they were hitchhiking girls
sexy skimpily clad hitchhiking girls lets kick them out
weve got a mystery to solve
the only mystery here is why we take our cues from a dick in a neckerchief
keep it up beatnik
ill feed you to the fucking dog
covering her ears shrieking the gang look to jay and bob
youse guys need to turn those frowns upside down
and we got just the thing for that
pulls out a bag of joints we call them doobie snax
as jay and bob toke up we go all slo mo and s freaky with the image seeming to swim
through their stoned haze we see old school witches skeletons and ghouls swirling about their heads the latter of which gets his mask taken off to reveal a man inside
jay and bob look at the gang then take a hit off their joint and look back
suddenly the gangs engaged in total debauchery the dude rides the windshield while the guy cackles insanely blindfolded by his neckerchief
bookish and beauty are in their underwear making out with each other
the great dane looks at jay and bob and says ri ray rand rirent rob the great dane rolls over revealing its red thing sticking way out of its sheath
jay and bob go wide eyed
look at his fuckin lipstick
hes got a stoner boner
jay and bob smile and pass out
we cut back to the gang who now appear as they did prior to weed vision
they stare at the o
jay and bob
i think they passed out
what do we do with them now
lets cut out their kidneys to sell on the black market and leave them in a seedy motel bathtub full of ice
oh god not again
jay lies in a bathtub full of ice screaming
theres a scar on his back
jay wakes up suddenly screaming
he startles bob awake as well as he clutched at this back lifting his shirt to see the scar
its not there
holy shit i had a horrible dream
looks around yo im hungry
where can we get some breakfast
bob looks around and then locks on something o
he points and jay looks smiles widely and nods
an establishing shot of the fast food eatery as jay and bob enter
as the pair head for the counter jay notices a public internet terminal
he tugs at silent bobs arm
yo check that shit out the internet
lets see if those fucks said something new about us and that stupid flick
bob shrugs heading for the terminal
he inserts a dollar and types following it up with a mouse click
the pair look at the screen and go wide eyed
any movie based on jay and silent bob is gonna lick balls because they both in fact lick balls
namely each others
jay and silent bob look at each other wide eyed
reading further yes they are real people
real stupid people
signed darth randal
to bob motherfucker
its time we wrote something back
type this shit down
silent bob starts typing as jay dictates
all you motherfuckers are gonna pay
you are the ones who are the ball lickers
were gonna fuck your mothers whole you watch and cry like little bitches
once we get to hollywood and find those miramax fucks who are making the movie were gonna make em eat our shit then shit our shit then eat their shit
which is made of our shit that we made em eat
then all you motherfuckers are next
love jay and silent bob
silent bob finishes typing and presses return
he and jay nod at each other then head over to the counter line looking up at the menu board
thatll fucking show em
now we eat our egga mooby muffins then get back on the road get to hollywood and stop that fucking movie from getting made
no more hairy bush nuns no more dogs
we keep our eye on the prize and not let nothing and i mean nothing distract me
as jay finishes speaking he looks to the o
doors and freezes
a gorgeous girl walks through the front doors all in slo mo to the tune of princes the most beautiful girl in the world
shes bathed in light glowing
she bats her eyelashes gliding toward us
jay is mouth agape wide eyed
silent bob looks at him then at the o
he slowly waves his hand in front of jays eyes getting zero response
the girl smiles at us
his pov goes from her face down to her breasts then down to her crotch
jay moves past silent bob and meets the girl in the middle of the floor
he embraces her and lands a long sweet kiss on her mouth
after a beat he starts fumbling like a teenager to get to second base under her shirt totally incongruous with the music
the girl kindly tries to deter him
but its just a fantasy
jays still standing there next to silent bob but he is sporting a huge boner
silent bob rolls his eyes
he grabs a soda cup off the counter and sticks it over jays boner just as the girl joins them in line
she smiles at the zombified jay
off cup oh my god
do you get free refills with that
oh what this
i just wear this for protection
you know so no guys try to grab my shit
dreamily and i am so fucking yours silent bob pokes jay who shakes of his daze
i mean hi

under his breath to bob jaynjustice sitting in a tree
f back to justice so you come here often
oh im not from around here

pointing out there
by that van
jay and bob look past justice to see a van with three other gorgeous girls stretching outside of it throwing their hair around looking incredibly sexy
without looking at silent bob jay quietly says to him dude i think i just filled the cup
jay and bob climb into the can getting odd looks from the other girls justice follows them in tossing the fast food to her friends
ladies ladies ladies

to sissy i cant believe what a pushover you are
and i cant believe fine ass bitches like yourselves eat that shit

suddenly jay and bob are parted by brent whos getting into the van
say whats all this talk about farting
sissy missy and chrissy immediately go from disgusted to sweet and airy totally switching characters
this is brent
hes with us too
brent tell these sillies that girls dont fart
of course they dont
only skeevy stoners fart
the very white brent puts his hand out to be slapped by jay and silent bob
what up homies
off the girls wow three guys four girls to jay and bob whats the count boys
jay and bob look at each other and roll their eyes
the van drives down the road
we hear singing from inside
brent strums a guitar and sings as the girls and jay and bob listen rolling eyes
hey there mister science guy
dont spray that aerosol in my eye
for i dont really want to die
im a noble rabbit
whatre you guys like a cover band or something
were the kansas state chapter of s
students against animal cruelty
and were on our way to colorado to give provasik a piece of our minds
everyone lets out a whoop except jay and bob
what the fuck are you bitches babbling about
watch the language little boy
there are females present
jay and silent bob eyeball brent until justice distracts them
provasik pharmaceuticals is a medical lab where they perform gross experiments on animals
so what kind of animals are we talking about here like bears and rhinos
no more like rabbits dogs cats
heck even monkeys if we dont speak for them who will
touches justices arm right jussy
jay sees this and his eyes flare over the competition
after a beat he relaxes
hey uh brent
can i talk to you over here for a second
brent joins jay strumming his guitar
jay addresses him confidentially
be honest yo youre down with this for the fine ass pussy right
im down with this because i love animals stupid
sheep are beautiful creatures
they are beautiful arent they
oh god yes
so then youd fuck a sheep
what is your damage little boy
youve got a sick and twisted world perspective
no you misunderstand me prince valiant
i mean if you were another sheep
would you fuck a sheep if you were another sheep
i suppose so
thats what i thought
suddenly loudly to all the side door of the van slides open and brent gets hurled out of the moving vehicle
jay throws his guitar at him as well yelling and flipping the bird as the van drives off
the van drives down the road
sissy sits in the passenger seat
chrissy kneels between them
what the fuck are we gonna do now
shut up im thinking
in the back justice studies some blueprints
jay joins her and she quickly folds them up
is hollywood near where were going
is that where you guys are from
oh a jersey boy
what brings you all the way out here
well we couldnt hang in front of the quick stop no more cause of the strainen en order which sucks ass cause its been like our home since we were
silent bob even busted his cherry there

bob blushes jay doesnt like that justices attention has strayed
look fuck that fat fuck im trying to tell a story here
anyway we were talking to brodie and he said theres gonna be a bluntman and chronic movie
so we went to see holden mcneil and he showed us the internet and thats where we found all these fucking little jerkoffs were saying shit about us

and now were here

suddenly another little jay devil appears in jays right shoulder
right about heres where the angels supposed to show up and tell you not to pull your dick out
but we bitch slapped that little fuck and sent him packing so its smooth sailing

they disappear in little puffs of smoke and jay shoves his hand down his pants getting ready to whip out his dick when suddenly a little jay angel appears on
his shoulder rubbing a swollen jaw
sorry im late
so whats the deal here
looks down oh shit youre not thinking of whipping your dick out at this fine piece of woman are you
jay thinks then nods yes
the jay angel rolls his eyes and slaps him
tell you what look at silent bob

jay looks to silent bob
silent bob looks from jays hand in his pants to jay and shakes his head no sternly
jay withdraws his hand from his pants
the jay angel nods satisfied
thats it boy put the dick down
you gotta go from the heart yo
no little perv bullshit will do for this one
be don juan de la nootch
now i gotta go beat the shit out of two suckerpunching little bitches
remember dont pull your dick out until she asks you to

the jay angel blinks away
justice looks at jay a bit confused

jay takes justices hand and kisses it
ill be right here
he winks at her smiles and moves to the other side of the can near silent bob
hes still smiling at justice and winking when he looks to silent bob who stares at him blankly then imitates jays hand kissing back at him jay scowls
the van pulls up and all pile out stretching
the girls head toward the store
justice calls over to jay and silent bob
you guys want anything from inside
no were cool thanks hon
justice smiles and heads inside
jay and silent bob study the front of the foreign convenience store
they look for a place to lean try a few spots out then settle into one
after a beat it just aint the same is it
this place licks balls compared to quick stop
silent bob shakes his head yeah
and speaking of licking balls how bout that justice chick
she is too fine
and she smells so fucking pretty
shes got a nice voice too
and that body
you know she never once said fuck off when i was talking to her or pulled out the pepper spray or nothing
i tell ya lunchbox she could be the one
justice is at the microwave when shes suddenly surrounded by the other girls
smooth move justice
slapping justice upside the head nice going four eyes
why the fuck did you let that little stoner throw brent our of the van
oh please if i had to listen to one more of those stupid songs i was going to throw him out myself
we needed brent justice
he was our patsy
well find someone else
besides i didnt see you trying to stop jay from throwing him out
because i didnt want to blow our cover
cover shmover you all hated his songs too
not as much as i hate you
justice offers chrissy a cold glance fuck if i dont get to kill someone soon im gonna fucking kill someone
rubbing chrissys shoulders dont mind chrissy
shes just a little too wound for sound
then how about you help me take the edge off
chrissy grabs missy forcefully and the pair make out hot and heavy in the middle of the convenience store
other customers regard them wide eyed
to customers theyre really good friends
would you two knock it off
were in the fucking heartland here
try to blend
they already do shes the milkmaid and shes the cow
oh im a cow am i
im a mad cow bitch
and now im gonna rip your head off and fuck your spine stump
calm to justice we have a very simple gang here justice
im the brains chrissys the brawn and missys the tech girl
but lately im having a hard time figuring out what youre doing here

thats because very few names rhyme with douchebag
getting in her face youre dancing on my last nerve strawberry shortcake
to sissy you deal with the weak link
im gonna take missy into the dirty convenience store bathroom and hate fuck the shit out of her
chrissy drags missy off
justice and sissy watch them go
and you said letting them read all that anais nin wouldnt amount to anything
dont change the subject
you know what you have to do now right
since you let our patsy slip away youve gotta convince the little kid and that fat guy to take his place
theyve gotta break into provasik now
youll do it or youre out of this gang
just use the little ones crush to convince him since hes so fucking in love with you
no hes not
what am i blind
he wasnt kissing your hand back in the van like he was fucking lord byron
well maybe he was just raised with manners
a girl walks past jay and bob heading out of the store
to exited girl to bob yeah
sissy continues to confront justice
youre the one that brought the kid in jussy
so youve gotta make amends
jay is not taking brents place as the patsy
that kid and his quite friend are our only options at this point
now we got about two hours before we get to boulder
that gives you plenty of of time to work on him
im not gonna do it
why the fuck not
because hes just to so innocent
justice looks out the window and smiles seeing jay dancing alongside bob
look at him jays dancing still but now we hear what hes singing to silent bob
im gonna finger fuck her tight little asshole
finger bang and tea bang my balls in her mouth
in her mouth balls a plenty in her mouth
balls balls sweaty balls sissy eyeballs justice whos still looking out at jay
whos it going to be jussy him or us

sissy nods at her
justice looks back out at jay
justice talks to jay and silent bob

its not really stealing its liberating it and finally hears him wait a second did you say no problem
yeah fuck we steal monkeys all the time

silent bob glares at jay

oh it for the best cause mon cheri takes her hand the cause of love
kisses her hand then releases snoogans what the heck is that

she smiles at jay touches his chin and heads to the front of the van
jay plays it cool until shes out of sight then humps silent bobs leg like a dog
singing i cant believe im gonna get some pussy for stealing a monkey
speaking if id known it was that easy idve been stealing monkeys since i was like seven and shit
jay looks at silent bob who clearly disapproves

dont forget that
that girls in love with me
up front justice talks to sissy while missy drives
theyre gonna do it
they do their part pats a video camera and well do ours
justice eyes sissy then slumps in her seat
the van rolls up across the street from the provasik labs parking in front of another large building
jay and silent bob get out along with justice
they wear ninja masks
missy and chrissy follow
remember we meet back here when youre done
you sure youre okay with this
as sure as i am that youre the hottest bitch i ever seen
chrissy lunges at jay missy holds her back dragging chrissy away
whats twisting that bitchs tits
maybe its because women dont like to be called bitches jay
well how bout piece of ass
how about not
well what the fuck am i supposed to call you then
something sweet you big goof
thinks then boo boo kitty fuck
thats a start
sissy jumps out of the van holding the video camera aiming it at jay and bob
jay before you go could you say something into the camera about the clitoris
to sissy man you are such a bitch off justice to jay shes just a little embarrassed
see jussy and i are putting together this documentary for our human sexuality class and we need a male perspective on the clitoris
the female clitoris
jay you dont have to do this
she elbows sissy
nah its cool hon
theres a few things i can say about the clit that is like you to hear
clears throat into camera i am the master of the clit
i make that shit work
it does what ever the fuck i tell it to do
no one rules the clit like me
off silent bob not this little fuck
none of you little fucks out there
i am the clit commander
remember that commander of all clits
jay proceeds to make some pussy eating faces
justice shakes her head at sissy who snaps the camera closed and smiles
knock em dead tiger
sissy climbs back into the van
to justice so can i get a little kiss for good luck
justice smiles at jay then kisses him sweetly on the lips
so can i get a little blow job for good luck
justice smiles and pulls jays mask down
he heads off revealing silent bob behind him lips puckered handing in midair
jay reached back into the frame pulling bob out
justice watches them go
justice climbs back into the van
justice sits glaring at sissy
hey lover girl
you cock block my authority again you lose your fucking fronts you got that
sissy takes the tape out of the camera and hands it off to missy beside whom is a bag full of high tech equipment
phase one down
while were executing phase two you edit that tape and grab a new car
lets suit up
jay and silent bob tuck and roll across the front lawn stopping at the building
silent bob pulls a grappling gun out of his coat
he fires it into the air as jay quickly gives the metal sign and the pair are lifted out of frame
its dead quiet and still
then the pair smash through a window landing in the floor in a ball
they lift their ninja hoods
jay glares at silent bob
you fat fuck missy peers through binoculars out the window
you can say that
time to shine
the quartet piles out of the van and we get our first look at them sexily geared up for action wearing all black
they head for a separate building
stopping at the front door
sissy gestures elaborately to missy and missy gestures elaborately back racing away into the night
justice offers sissy a look
you are so gay
chrissy sticks a box on the door and presses a button
on a digital readout numbers roll until they stop on four different digits
the door lock clicks open
once were inside i want complete silence
holding up high tech device missy whipped this up
it counts our decibel level
if it goes into the red alarm were dead
so not even the slightest noise got it
justice blows her off
sissy enters the building followed closely by chrissy
justice lingers at the door taking one last look back at the provasik building fretting for jay and bob
pokes her head back out justice
move your ass
justice heads inside
we pan up to reveal a sign that reads jay and bob stand there looking around the room
its lines with cages all of which contain sad looking animals
a tear forms in silent bobs eye
jay rolls his eyes and hits him
stay frosty you big fucking softie
weve got a job to do
silent bob nods and clicks on a flashlight
the pair wade through the cages
jay stops at an emergency box hanging on the wall
inside it theres a pistol
check this out lunchbox
this shit fucks you up like percocets
jay elbows the glass breaking it
he takes the gun out and tosses it to bob
later me and justice can shoot each other with it and fuck like stoned test bunnies
silent bob rolls he eyes and sticks the gun in his coat
the pair look through the cages until hear the distinct sound of a monkey
jay directs silent bobs flashlight to the cage from where the sound emitted
the three girls stand at the end of a large hallway
at the other end is a glass case full of diamonds
sissy pulls and aerosol can from her utility belt and sprays the air in the hallway
she watches the decibel monitor which rises only slightly at the sound of the spray
suddenly within the mist laser beams become apparent
sissy hands the decibel monitor to chrissy and takes a few steps back shaking her hands to limber up
she then runs forward and does an impressive series of flips down the hallway not touching a single laser beam
chrissy checks the decibel monitor which rises only slightly
once sissys flipping comes to a stop at the other end of the hallway near the diamond case she makes a hand gesture to justice
justice nods and proceeds to do the same series of flips down the hallway not tripping the alarm
chrissy checks the decibel monitor which rises only slightly
justice lands beside sissy and then sissy gestures to chrissy
chrissy tosses the decibel monitor over the laser beams sissy catches it and the monitor rises only slightly
then chrissy proceeds with her series of flips which are even more impressive than the other two including running up walls and pushing into handstand flips
when she passes the last laser beam she lands between sissy and justice arms in the air like a gymnast
then she lets out a loud manly fart
the decibel monitor goes red and an alarm starts ringing through the building
holy fuck the little stoner was right sissy shutters the glass surrounding the diamonds
she ours them into a bag and races back down the hallway followed by justice and chrissy
the girls emerge from the diamond exchange just as missy pulls up in a convertible
missy tosses a metal box to chrissy who catches it and races toward the van while sissy and justice pile into the convertible
i cant believe it
months of planning and its all blown by a fucking fart
we cant just leave them like this
that alarms gonna bring the cops here any minute
that was always the plan justice
they take the heat off of is long enough until we can get out of town
chrissy attaches the metal box to the side of the van
kaboom you little stoner fucks
the girls pull up in the convertible and chrissy jumps into the car with them
the convertible screeches away leaving the can sitting there
the metal has magnetically attached to the side is counting down from two minutes
jay and bob carry a large canvas bag between them
something seems to move inside it
the head for the exit but silent bob hesitates offering a sad look to the animals in all the cages
jay hits him
what the fuck are you looking at
there aint no snacks here man
now we got what we came for so lets get the fuck out
silent bob half gestures to the cages forlorn
jay shakes his head frustrated
yeah its sad
but what the fuck are we supposed to do about it
silent bob offers jay a look
the front doors burst open spilling out jay silent bob carrying their bag and hundreds of animals cats dogs birds rabbits
all race off into the night
jay and bob race toward the van
jay screams at it
suddenly jay and bob stop dead in their tracks
oh shit three cop cars screech up the van between them and jay and bob
the cops leap out of their cruisers guns drawn
jay looks to bob pissed the counter on the device attached to the van hits and the van blows up
jay and bob get thrown backwards in one direction the cops in the other
on all fours jay looks at the burning shell of the van a tear forming in his eye
justice we crane up from him as he bellows silent bob grabs jay and drags him out of frame still carrying the bag
we start on a sign on the door that reads federal wildlife marshal colorado field office then pull back to see a deputy opening the door and heading inside
the deputy enters just as a fax is coming through at an operations board
he rips it off reading it
his eyes go wide
calling off marshal willenholly
marshal willenholly sits on the bowl staring at four legged law man magazine eyeing it lustily
below frame he jerks off
yeah you chug that ass cock baby it takes two hands to hold doesnt it
uhhh as he climaxes a ganging at the door disrupts him
sir we got a report of a break in at provasik pharmaceuticals testing lab
willenholly emerges from the bathroom holding the magazine
theres a massive wet spot on the front of his pants
have you read this article on the mule suckers in tijuana
good god i wish that was in our jurisdiction id shut down every last one of those ass cock chuggers personally
the deputy looks at the stain on willenhollys pants then at willenholly
ass means donkey
hands him a fax looks at fax boulder hunh
well gas up the jet
we dont have a jet sir
and boulders only ten minutes away
then gas up the next best thing
there are fire trucks all over the place now
the burned out van is being poured over by cops
just then willenholly pulls up on a moped
he parks it and surveys the wreckage
my oh my oh my
who let the cats out
thinks wait is that right
excuse me who the hell are you
willenholly rips down the velcro patch on his jacket revealing a badge
federal wildlife marshal
this investigation is now under my jurisdiction
and why is that
because someone let a whole mess of animals out of their cages sir
well we believe that was just a diversionary tactic used to call attention away from the real heist over here at the diamond exchange
thats a believable scenario
it sounds more like something out of a bad movie
willenholly and the cop look at the camera
then another cop joins them
sir the provasik people say theyve rounded all their animals up except for one an orangutan
listen up ladies and gentlemen
our fugitive has been on the run for hours
average simian foot speed over uneven ground barring injuries or preoccupation with tire tubes mites or bananas is four miles an hour
that gives us a radius of twenty miles
calling out from crowd twenty four sir
six hours times four miles an hour is twenty four
doing the math in his head yes
yes youre right
twenty four miles
now what i want out of all of you is a hard target search
excuse me sir
what does that mean exactly a hard target search
whats a hard target
its a target thats hard
anyway so are you referring to the searchs level of difficulty
or is the hard target the monkey
or the people who stole the monkey
the cops now chatter amongst themselves to the effect of yeah it could mean that too hes got a point etc
willenholly rubs his temples
okay how about this
what i want out of all of you is a thorough search of every gas station residence warehouse farmhouse henhouse outhouse and doghouse in that area
checkpoints go up at fifteen miles
wouldnt it make sense to put them up at every twenty four miles seeing as thats how far theyd have gotten in the last six hours
they begin chattering amongst themselves again
willenholly looks at them all defeated
he starts to cry
this is so frustrating
its just so hard sometimes yelling another cop joins willenholly carrying a large fat envelope
sir this was just delivered to the station
what is it
its a tape from the terrorists whore claiming credit for the break in
is it vhs or beta
you know what never mind
do you have a vcr
willenholly and the cops stare at the o
tv shocked as the video ends
oh my god without looking up have the jet gassed up and ready to go at a moments notice
sir we dont have a jet just a helicopter
dialing his cell phone doesnt anybody have a jet anymore
into cell phone plafsky
it is willenholly
you gotta get me on the national news pronto
because we may very well be dealing with the two most dangerous men on the planet
jay and silent bob sit close to each other staring at suzanne the orangutan who sits on a log across from them staring back
this is jussys monkey to suzanne angrily suzanne covers her eyes with her hands suddenly
jay and silent bob startle with jay leaping behind silent bob and pulling back as if hes going to strike
to silent bob do something
tons of fun
silent bob offers the ape a weak wave
suzanne drops her hands from her face and waves back
jay cranes his neck to see over silent bob
is that fucking thing waving at us
jay steps out from behind bob
they state at the ape
that monkey understood us
maybe its some sort of super monkey
suzanne offer them a raspberry
spitting as if the comment was ridiculous
jay and silent bob react with surprise at this
what the fuck was that for
its not a stupid idea
i seen it in congo
suzanne holds her nose as if to say congo stunk
silent bob smiles in agreement and amusement
jay looks at him stung
youre my bitch
you get my back
dont go joining this chimps side
jay looks around the woods formulating a thought
silent bob moves toward the ape extending his hand to shake hers
yo what if theres more super monkeys up in the lab
maybe theyre making an army of em up there
maybe its a conspiracy like on the x files roswell style
jays delusion we enter into jays head and see we pan over from a chimp in a chemists coat measuring liquids in a pair of beakers to a chimp at
a drafting table sketching blueprints for an insidious war machine
an orangutan shakes hands with a group of five well dressed men one of which looks like the cigarette smoking man from the x files
working in secret with a crew of double dealing nicotine fiending fucks thatre selling out the human race these supermonkeys will use simian science and their genius iqs to make
man and monkey alike believe that theyre the superior species
a monkey dressed like mussolini addresses a huge crowd of apes who wave fists in the air
then all itll take is one little monkey in a spiffy suit to whip the dumber chimps into a frenzy until they go all ape shit and start demanding more
bananas better pay and human flesh
randal leads a pack of humans racing through a cornfield and is shot in the neck
he collapses revealing a gorilla on horseback holding a rifle
two other gorillas throw a net over him
youll have to be faster than walt flanagans dog to outrun the warrior gorillas who hunt humans for sport profit and the occasional inter species blow job
and if you dont wind up with a monkey hog in your mouth youll be captured killed or worse
cornelius and zera looking chimps dissect the brain of a living screaming dante
the quick stop is overrun by vines in a jungle like atmosphere
monkeys exit the store carrying bunches of bananas
the sign now reads ape stop then these monkey fucksll start wearing our clothes and rebuilding the world in their image
we start on a full shot of jay on the beach looking up then snap zoom out to reveal jay kneeling before the beach buried statue of liberty screaming his
and only those who outwit those damn dirty apesll ever remember that it was man who once ruled the earth
at statue another close up of jays painted face
behind him suzanne and silent bob are playing patty cake
jay eyes suzanne angrily
not on my watch motherfucker
jay turns and rushes suzanne ferociously
jay trips on a root poking out of the ground and hits the dirt
suzanne then goes over to jay pulls his face to hers and kisses him on the lips
alright you can live
silent bob helps jay to his feet
you see that
bitches love me
heading off besides were in the fucking clear yo
its not like anyone knows we stole the monkey
an anchorman addresses the camera
im reg hartner and this is a news now bulletin
a provasik animal testing facility in boulder was the focus of an attack by a terroristic primate rescue syndicate calling themselves the coalition for liberation of itinerant tree dwellers
or simply c
a graphic of the c
logo appears beside him nailing home the joke
in a videotape sent to authorities this morning credit for the liberation of an orangutan from the lab last night is taken by these men a video capture of jay
and silent bob from pre break in appears on screen
identified in literature that accompanies the tape as jay and silent bob
in this chilling clip they make it very clear that they are in control of the c
on screen is the c
a digitized voice narrates
we are the c
none of you are safe
now tremble before the might of our merciless leader
the logo gives way to the video of jay and bob that sissy shot before the provasik break in
jays yelling into the camera
coming out of the video footage the anchorman shakes his head chilled
here to help us understand this footage is federal wildlife marshal willenholly
pull out to reveal willenholly beside the anchorman
marshal what can you tell us about the c
from the intelligence weve been able to gather weve discovered that the c
is a tiny offshoot of the l
the liberate apes before imprisoning apes movement
the men you saw in the video are believed to be the masterminds responsible for the frenzied c
activity last night
they go by the obvious code names jay and silent bob
to camera if you should come across them or any other c
ies please exercise extreme caution
on the tv screen is willenholly and the video capture of jay and silent bob
holden looks up from his drawing table shocked
from tv marshal how do you respond to allegations that federal wildlife marshals office allowed the c
to slip through their fingers
were all over the c
shakes his head nights like this i miss dating a lesbian
from behind the register dante and randal stare at the tv slack jawed
from tv is there also speculation that jay and silent bob may be responsible for the diamond exchange jewel heist that occurred in the same vicinity of downtown boulder last
theres nothing to suggest that no
but these men are still to be considered very dangerous
to dante i told you that restraining order was a good idea
on the second floor terrace of a run down roadside motel sissy missy and chrissy dance in their undies and drink champagne
on the first floor terrace below justice leans against the open sliding glass door watching the news report on a tv inside the room with the volume turned way up
on tv is that your cell phone
on tv yes excuse me
on tv into cell phone federal wildlife marshal
im on my way
shuts phone to anchorman we got em
theyre in utah
to camera citizens of utah steer clear of the c
stimulation of the c
is not recommended
justice turns the tv off and yells up to sissy
your tape worked
the news is all about jay and silent bobs provasik break in with almost no mention of the diamond heist
yelling down to justice i told you those two were the perfect patsies
now we lay low for awhile just in case and start planning the next job
dont you feel any regret
jay and bob dont deserve this
they were really sweet
the only thing i regret is not gutting that little trout mouthed prick like a fish and playing twister with his vitals
you are so nasty
ill show you nasty you little slut
would you two get a room
fine well take yours
getting up in sissys face i am gonna stain your sheets bi otch
chrissy dances away with missy heading inside
sissy rolls her eyes
sarah lawrence girls
theyre your gang
oh and not yours
you know i dont get you justice
you used to be all about the girl stuff stealing boning blowing shit up
now youre like this little priss with a conscience
its really a fucking drag
we all gotta grow up some time
if moping around over some little boy youre crushing on is being grown up then pass me my wonder woman underoos
dont you feel the least bit of guilt for what we did to those guys
does jussy wussy feel all dirty about setting up her boyfriend
then how about taking a shower
sissy dumps the bag of diamonds over the side of the terrace
they rain down on justice below
just then a pizza delivery guy approaches the lower terrace carrying a stack of pizzas
you the gals that ordered the pizzas
this dopey bitch ordered the large plain but i could go for some hot thick sicilian
no charge lady
he rushes into the motel justice sighs looking up at the stars
quietly im sorry jay
jay silent bob and suzanne sit at a booth eating
jay chews a burger while silent bob eats pancakes and suzanne digs into a banana split
you know justice died trying to save this monkey so maybe we should keep her around
that way we can honor her memory
silent bob and suzanne are oblivious digging into their food
look at you tubby bitches
im waxing all sentimental and youre all about a fucking meal and shit
now aint you glad we stopped to eat
and you were all piss scared the copsd bust us or something
you know what i say
singing a la nwa via bullhorn jay and bob freeze and go wild eyed for a beat
then you think theyre talking to us
theres a few cop cars outside and the sheriff is yelling at the diner through his bullhorn
beside him are the other to other cops fuck it lets give em thirty
suddenly willenholly rushes up dramatically ducking behind the car gun drawn
an orangutans a member of the great ape family
its not a monkey
look whos the federal wildlife marshal here
into bullhorn jay suzanne and silent bob peer over the top of their booth like scared rats
what the fuck are you waiting for
go out there and give em the monkey
silent bob looks to jay shocked
oh what man
i said that shit before i knew they were gonna shoot us
yes jussy was a hottie but i aint takin no bullet for no monkey
bob pulls suzanne close to him welling up with tears
jay rolls his eyes
oh brother this is like something out of fucking benji
look man maybe its not that bad back at the lab
maybe they experiment on em by like making em fuck a bunch of different good looking monkeys
we dont know
maybe they got it real sweet
suzanne shakes her head no
bob points to her as if shes strengthening his point
to suzanne you stay out of this you weepy little chimp
looks around thinking fuck man i aint no strategist
youre the guy that makes the blueprints
i dont even have the fucking smarts of a little jays eyes fall on a scared family in a nearby booth
theres a little kid around five or so and hes wearing a hooded sweatshirt and a baseball cap
kid willenhollys on the bullhorn yelling at the diner
the sheriff looks on
to cops everyone has bullets in their guns right
jay and silent bob emerge from the diner with suzanne between them theyre holding her raised hands
shes now dressed up in the sweatshirt and jeans the kid was wearing in the diner with the baseball cap pulled down over her face
its a pretty piss poor disguise
were just trying to take our son out of this hostile environment
from behind the cop car the sheriff looks to willenholly
maybe theyre one of those gay couples
jay seizes on the idea
silent bob nods fervently
and this is our adopted love child
were not from around here
dont make us go back to our liberal city home with a tales of prejudice and bigotry in the heart of utah
whispers to bob you see the shit i gotta put up with for you
now i got this guy thinking im gay
oh god this is the last thing i need a bunch of uppity homosexuals shooting their mouth off in the liberal press that the federal wildlife marshals office persecutes gays
you see this badge
i think id recognize an ape if i saw one
and the only thing i do recognize here is a political fiasco im going to avoid by letting this butt fucking brady bunch go
jay is whispering to silent bob still vexed by and ill tell you another thing what if that guy shows up around the stores one day and starts telling everybody
you and me are poo gilists
how are we gonna get any pussy then hunh
jay and silent bob look at each other shocked
they look back out at willenholly whos yards away
jay points at himself as if to say me
via bullhorn calling over so we can just go
via bullhorn yes sir or maam
please accept my apologies for detaining you and your unorthodox but constitutionally protected family unit
amazed un fucking believable
id like to offer a big gay thank you sir
well tell all our gay friends that utah is gay friendly country for gays who are gay
im sure utah appreciates that
you might also want to make it clear that the federal wildlife marshals office is also pro mo as well
winks at the sheriff and might i add thats one fine looking boy youre raising
well thats cuz hes from my sperm
see i knocked up a hot woman friend of ours who i also fuck on the side
so as not to be all the way gay
but my tubby husband here is one hundred percent queer
he loves the cock
he certainly looks insatiable
bye bye jay silent bob and suzanne head off down the road
willenholly and all watch them go
the sheriff is livid
well its not my way but damned if there doesnt go one happy family
balloon two now we just shoot some tear gas into that diner and when the two guys run out with the monkey well willenholly suddenly freezes thinking
he looks to the sheriff
that was the them wasnt it
jay silent bob and suzanne are laughing
i said you love the cock
i gotta be the craftiest motherfucker alive
gunshots ring out and bullets whiz by the trio who are now in full panic mode
willenholly and the cops race after them firing
jay bob and suzanne race away ducking bullets
the trio race across what looks like a bridge but isnt shots still ringing out
jay spots a manhole
he points at it screaming
silent bob pops the cover off with bullets ricocheting all around them jay leaps into the manhole
jay lands in a sewer tunnel like in the fugitive
suzanne lands on top of him
take your stinking paws off me you damn dirty ape
yelling up bullets hitting the pavement around him silent bob dives into the sewer grate as well but silent bob gets stuck
jay rolls his eyes

silent bob struggles while jay and suzanne try to pull him through the hole

one rectal breach coming up
jay and suzanne pull with all their might
tight on the sheriff as he squints to aim

the sheriffs gun fires
jay and suzanne fall backwards as silent bob pops through
the bullet ricochets off the curb as silent bobs feet slip through
jay silent bob and suzanne are in various states of collapse
jay and bob look up at the hole
just like winnie the pooh
willenholly and the sheriff arrive at the manhole

willenholly starts rolling up his sleeves as the sheriff looks on
you and your men stay up here

a federal wildlife marshal doesnt wait for his prey to come to him
he comes to it

willenholly embraces the sheriff
youve taught me so much
willenholly then climbs into the sewer disappearing
the cops look at the sheriff for a beat who heads o
saying fuck this asshole

tight on jay bob and suzanne looking into the distance bathed by natural light
we hear the loud sounds of water rushing
this reminds me of the night i fucked your mom yo
one big wet smelly gaping hole and me wishing i had a board tied to my ass pull back to reveal jay silent bob and suzanne standing at the precipice
of the sewer tunnel that pokes out of a dam
water rushed below
to keep from falling in
willenholly aims his gun at the trios backs
our heroes comply but jay speaks

but suzannes still looking out of the dam
hes lining us up like fucking circus seals

tight on suzanne whos looking down at the raging water below
her brow hardens with purpose
tight on suzannes right hand grabbing jays right hand
tight on suzannes left hand grabbing bobs left hand
suzanne leaps forward at us pulling jay and silent bob backwards
suzanne leaps from the mouth of the tunnel dragging jay and bob with her
willenholly goes wide eyed holstering his gun
oh no think you can pull a peter pan on me
he races toward the mouth of the tunnel and leaps out as well
as willenholly plummets he passes suzanne hanging by her feet off a pipe that pokes out from beneath the mouth of the tunnel
shes hanging upside down holding jay and silent bobs hands
willenholly plummets toward the water below and ker splashes into the drink
suzanne has pulled jay and silent bob back into the mouth of the tunnel
you see that shit
damn remind me not to get on the monkeys bad side
yo boost her up
so we can talk so we can get the fuck out of here
silent bob lifts suzanne over the tunnel onto the pavement near the manhole
she sits there looking down
silent bob lifts jay over the top of the tunnel toward the road suzanne sits by the side of the road
a car pulls into the shot
jay and silent bob climb over the cliff onto the highway just in time to see the passenger door slamming on a truck with los angeles plates and a sign
that reads critters of hollywood
suzanne is looking out the back window waving
jay and bob leap to their feet chasing after the truck
the truck speeds away in the distance
jay and silent bob stand there panting
who the fuck just steals a monkey
silent bob indicates themselves
pissed well this fucking blows
we got one more day to stop those fucks from making that movie and someone goes and takes the only thing i had left from the one woman i ever
loved enough not to try to stick my hand down her pants
silent bob mimes that they should go after suzanne

silent bob mimes in the direction the car went
jay stares at him
what is that supposed to mean

bob starts an elaborate pantomime
jay tries to guess what hes saying
you gotta take a shit
no you gotta take a salad
take a salad
what the fuck are you trying to say
bobs on the verge of tears trying to mime out his message
silent bob grabs jay and screams into his face
bob releases jay breathing heavily and storms off in the direction of the car went
jay watched him go for a beat then follows muttering under his breath say it dont spray it bitch
and might i add thats one fine looking boy youre raising
the sheriff and his men stand around eating donuts laughing
the station doors slam open and willenholly enters soaking wet
all the cops stare at him
well if it isnt the wildlife experts

hookers propositioning a potential john and finally we start on the street sign and pan down to a jeep wrangler that pulls up
a gorgeous woman in sunglasses drives with silent bob sitting in the back seat
after a beat jay pops up from under the dash wiping his mouth looking around
the woman sighs and zips up her pants
jay and bob hop out and wave to the woman as the car pulls away
bob offers jay a look

justice blew up
two hookers approach them

for all we know they could already be on the lot
as jules speaks jay and bob walk into the frame behind her looking up at the studio sign
they then notice the camera and start waving behind jules
justice goes wide eyed seeing jay and bob on e
she hops out of her seat
oh my god
justice looks around panicky
her eyes fall on the diamonds sitting atop the satchel on the table
justice looks at the diamonds then the tv screen
she thinks for a beat then fuck it
she pours the diamonds into the satchel and shoves it in her pocket
the door slowly opens in the dark bedroom and justice crawls to the bedside table reaching for a set of keys
in the bed missy and chrissy make out under the sheets moaning
sissys banging the pizza delivery guy against the vanity
justice grabs the keys leaving a note in their place
as she crawls back out we push in on the note which reads the convertible skids out taking off
theres a loud scream then sissy missy and chrissy rush down the stairs in varied states of undress and sheet wrap
wiping their mouths
sissy holds justicess note

chrissy stands there still shrugs then digs her hand into her panties

news crew packs up
jay and silent bob study the main gate
they watch the security guard approach a car thats just pulled up
the guard checks the drivers pass then lifts the gate to let the car through
jay looks to bob
we gotta play this right
bob nods after a beat the pair tear ass past the guard booth
the guard leaps out of the booth blowing a whistle and giving chase
jay and bob race around the building toward what looks like an open alley then smash into it falling down
the open alley is a background painting thats being moved by some scenics
jay and bob get up shaking off the impact
i hate how fake hollywood is
the security guard catches up to them now grabbing them by their shoulders spinning them around

silent bob looks at jay wide eyed and scared

silent bob wells up with tears slowly dropping to his knees reaching for jays pants
the security guard bends down low to watch at crotch level
suddenly jay hammers his two fists into the security guards neck knocking him out
silent bob falls into a sitting position on the ground relieved
jay looks at him

jay and silent bob stand amidst a line of extras
silent bob looks o

jay looks and sees a college bar set that looks like the college bar from good will hunting complete with clark the stuffy college jerk
matt damon stands off to the side loosening up for the scene
ben affleck calls to the o

gus van sant sits off to the side counting a stack of money

jay turns excitedly to bob
this has gotta be the bluntman flick cause thats those two fucks from that mork movie

the clapper loader holds a clapboard in front of bens face

the clapper loader claps the board closed and races off
ben looks to gus
gus looks up from counting his money
jesus ben i said im busy
ben shakes his head and then starts the scene with clark

but you know frankly i found the class rather elementary
you know i dont doubt that it was
i remember that class

theres no problem
i was still just hoping you might give me some insight into the evolution of the market economy in the southern colonies
see wood says stepping in whatd i say
didnt i say youd be back here regurgitating gordon wood
but you forgot about vickers no i just read vickers so im up on inherited wealth hunting
but youre not the angry brilliant young mind you once were just itching to vent your frustrations
in the background jay and silent bob get bored and head out of the shot
after a beat they get pushed back in by the once sean told you it wasnt your fault you lost the edge william
you stopped hitting the books with a vengeance and now ive read shit you havent even heard about yet
face facts my friend love made you a soft little pussy boy unable to stand up to an academic showdown like you used to

chuckie snarling its hunting season
matt will spins to face clark with two huge guns in his hands
he blows clark away jay and bob hit the deck
matt will stands there guns smoking

suddenly the door to the soundstage swings open and the security guard jay knocked out rushes in followed by other security guards who comb the place
sorry to interrupt sirs but have a ten oh seven on our hands

the security guard sees jay and bob crouched behind ben he points screaming
ben and matt turn to jay and bob jay smiles
affleck youre the bomb in phantoms yo
jay and bob then race out of frame closely followed by the security guards
matt head off arms thrown in the air
if anyones looking for me ill be in my trailer trying to figure out how i got here from an academy award
jay and bob rush out pulling a bench in front of the door blocking it
they race ten feet to another soundstage across from them and head inside a door
jay and silent bob rush in to see wes craven getting ready to direct a scene with a familiar looking ghostface killer and shannen doherty
the clapper loaders clapboard reads scream scream four scene thirty seven take one
claps it and rushes off action
the killer chases shannen around the room falling over stuff until she hits him with a lamp knocking him out

shannen pulls the mask off the short performer to reveal jay and silent bob go wide eyed

security guards race through chasing after the exited pair
jay and bob race through the lot with bob carrying suzanne
on a fake new york city street another movie is shooting
the trio bob and weave through the shoot until at the end of the alley a set golf cart pulls up and four security guards pile out forming a human
wall blocking their path
jay and bob stop dead looking back to see the other security guards gaining
what the fuck are we gonna do
just then a p
on a bike pulls up nearby
he ditches the bike and grabs papers from the large hanging basket in front
jay and bob look at each other race over to the bike and jump on putting suzanne in the basket
they start pedaling away furiously closely followed by the security guard posse
silent bob peddles like mad racing toward the golf cart
bob pops a wheelie and the bike races up the front of the vehicle taking flight below the security guards stare in awe as jay and silent bob atop the
bike with suzanne in the front basket go past a moon on a billboard on the side of a soundstage a la e
jay and bob look down then at each other
then they look ahead and let out a scream
the bike crashes through a window in the side of a soundstage building
the bike lands and jay and bob and suzanne go tumbling onto the floor covered in glass
they look up to see
james van der beek and jason biggs dressed as jay and silent bob looking down as them
holy shit that looked like it hurt

silent bob nods at jay then suzanne
suzanne heads off leaving jay and bob to huddle

cmere suzanne pulls jason and james out of the frame
while jay and silent bob continue to huddle the sounds of a beating are heard o
alright heres what we do start swinging and dont stop until those young hollywood fucks are out of commission
jay and bob spin to face jason and james only to go wide eyed
suzanne stands atop the fallen actors who are bloodied and beaten and knocked out cold
she holds her hands skyward clasped like a champion
thats one funky monkey
suddenly theres a banging at the door of the dressing room
this is security
weve got a pair of intruders at large and they crashed through a window we thought might be yours
to door deepening voice uh yeah

the security guard look at one another
well just be outside the door sirs
the security guards stifle a laugh as one makes a blow job face to the rest
bob opens an air vent in the wall
he puts suzanne into it and hands her the tranquilizer gun miming to her
she nods and starts crawling through the ductwork bob closes the vent again and starts rifling through a nearby closet
what the fuck are we gonna do
how are we gonna get out of here without them seeing us
silent bob pulls a pair of hangered costumes from the closet smiling
the security guards push a cuffed jason and james into a waiting cop car
the pair are still dressed like jay and silent bob
to cops hell be the pie in prison
jay and bob creep toward a door we dont see the outfits
this was a good idea lunchbox
in these outfits were totally incognito
suddenly and a
appears grabbing them by the shoulders
mister van der beek
great youve changed costumes already
lets get you to set
pulling them off the director doesnt like to be kept waiting
it looks like the batcave but its not
off to the side near the monitor and chair setup a black director eyeballs the hustling white crew
look at all these crackers seventy million dollars and i cant even get a black grip
a white p
brings a cup of latte to the director

confidentially they all want a part of the movie and i got just the part for em
jay and silent bob go wide eyed as chaka heads off
chaka climbs behind his monitor
is waiting for him with another cup of coffee
i got you another cup of coffee sir
chaka smacks the coffee out of his hand and sits down
the clapper loader jumps in front of the startled jay and bob getting ready
after a beat he turns to silent bob
i just wanna say that i loved when you fucked that pie
calling off the clapper loader shuts the clapboard and races off
from behind the monitor chaka calls out jay and bob as bluntman and chronic look at each other for a beat
then uh snootchie bootchies
suddenly the wall to their left explodes
jay and bob hit the deck
through the smoking rubble steps cock knocker the arch nemesis of bluntman and chronic
hes a normal looking man with huge overgrown fists
what the fuck
you thought id never find your precious bluntcave did you hemp knight
but now you and your sidekick are finally in the grasp of cock knocker
why do they call you cock knocker
cock knocker slams one of his huge fists into jays balls
jay drops to his knees wailing
cock knocker then pulls a vibrator looking device from his cape
he presses a button on it and a laser beam rises out of the vibrator like a light saber
any last words before i bust your balls bluntman
silent bob quickly looks right then left
his eyes fall on a wall of armaments on which hands a silver bong under the placard bong saber extremely experimental
do not use
its out of his reach
silent bob closes his eyes concentrating
he reached his hand out to the bong saber attempting the jedi mind trick
suddenly the bong snaps from the armory into bobs grip
the bong saber blasts to life and bob strikes a defensive pose
bob rushes the astonished cock knocker and the pair start light saber dueling
from behind monitor damn
now that was one special effect
this pictures gonna make house party look like house party two
or house party three
shut the fuck up
cock knocker battles bob back
he vogues some impressive blade handling prompting bob to make a run for it up the ladder of the bong reactor and over cock knockers head
he lands behind cock knocker striking another pose
cock knocker then high kicks bob in the face knocking him on his ass across the floor
cock knocker rushers over to deliver a saber kill shot when we hear cock knocker turns to see jay standing on the rotating monitor station holding a double sided saber
he clicks it and two beams emit a la the darth maul light saber in episode one
call me darth balls
jay leaps at cock knocker wielding the double beamed bong saber
from behind the monitor i think george lucas is going to sue somebody willenhollys car screeches up and willenholly jumps with a shotgun
he slides across the hood of the car and lands beside the flashing red light
looking around so this is hollywood
suddenly full of purpose lights camera action jay and silent bob
willenholly cocks his shotgun and heads for the door
the door bursts open and willenholly charges in firing two shots o
willenholly goes wide eyed
its not bluntcave
were on a different soundstage where a kids movies being shot moobys grand adventure
theres a barney sized mooby surrounded by little kids
the kids stare back at willenholly terrified
the mooby suit has smoking bullet holes in it
oh my god to kids um sorry
that was supposed to be a warning shot
uh it looks like im on the wrong uh wrong set
the kids look at the fallen mooby
on looks angrily at the o

jay attacks cock knocker with his bong saber full throttle
breaking character you are not upstaging me van der beek
jay whacks away happily at the actor playing cock knocker hacking him up onto the ladder of the bluntcaves nuclear reactor
cock knocker climbs the ladder slightly to evade the attack dueling jay back with the saber in his other hand
chaka on cue jay delivers a kill shot to one of cock knockers huge fists cutting it off a la empire
silent bob joins jay as jay turns off this double bong saber jay grins at cock knocker
now whose balls have been busted bitch
suddenly a gun shot rings out
all turn to see a roughed up willenholly training his gun first on jay then bob
stops here jay and silent bob
revealing badge calling out everyone stay calm
im a federal wildlife marshal
these men are the leaders of a terrorist organization wanted for the abduction of a monkey
they didnt really steal that monkey
all turn to see justice approaching from the shadows
willenholly trains his gun on her
jays mouth drops
it was just a diversion so we could steal these
justice pulls the bag of diamonds from her jacket revealing them
and theyre not the leaders of c
is not real
no the clits real
the female orgasm is a myth
to jay are you guys alright
i thought you blew up boo boo kitty fuck
smiling you remembered

missy chrissy and i are international jewel thieves
we were setting you up as a patsy but i couldnt go through with it because i

all turn to see sissy missy and chrissy slinking from the shadows guns drawn
because shes gonna be one dead bitch
to justice hi jussy
we catch you at a bad time
you shouldve just let these guys go down jussy
hey i wanted to go down but i was waiting until i got to know her a little better

i cant do that sissy points her gun at jay then lover boy gets one in the brain
all turn to look at chaka
would any of you lovely ladies like a private audition to be in my movie
justice high kicks the gun out of sissys hand
it lands on the ground discharging
then everyone starts shooting and running for cover
jay and silent bob hurl themselves over the bluntmobile
missy and chrissy flip over a lavish exquisitely packed craft service table labeled
they pop back up and start firing at willenholly
willenholly leaps behind a barren craft service table that holds a bag of smarties and a dented can of rc cola
he pops up and returns fire
when both are out of bullets they drop back down behind the table and reload
from behind his table willenholly yells the girls and willenholly both pop back up and open fire again
chaka ducks behind the monitor
a shitload of white people with guns
time to get my black ass out of here
he races off passing justice and sissy who circle each other defensively striking kung fu poses
you really let me down justice
throwing it all away for a little stoner with bad pronunciation
ignoring him whats it gonna be sissy
which fighting style do you want me to kick your ass in
are you kidding me
i taught you all all your moves myself
theres not a style you can bust that i cant defend against
youre no match for my shaolin monk
yeah but i can bury you with my crouching tiger
a little venuss flytrap
ill counter with dragon crane
how about a little bitch my man aint yo babys daddy
beat smiles bring it on
justice rushes sissy and instead of sleek kung fu they launch into a down and dirty girls cat fight hair pulling and screaming
behind the bluntmobile jay and bob watch all the action
yo i hope one of em rips the other ones shirt off and we see some tit
both bob and jay smile at each other nodding
banky joins them crawling in on his belly covering his head
mister van der beek
i just wanted to say hi
im banky fucking edwards
just the motherfucker we came to see
shocked holy shit
what the fuck are you guys doing here
sissy has justice on her belly banging her face into the floor screeching
jay bob and banky continue
stop the movie
are you crazy
all these assholes are calling us names on the internet cause of this stupid movie
i feel for you boys i really do
those net snipers can be really cruel
but miramax paid me a shitload of money for bluntman and chronic so it occurs to me that people bad mouthing you on some web site is none of my
oh but i think it is
banky stares at silent bob agog jay rolls his eyes
here we go again shut the fuck up
to banky we had a deal with you on the comics for likeness rights
and as were not only the artistic basis but also the character basis for your intellectual property bluntman and chronic when we said property was optioned by miramax films you
were legally obliged to secure our permission to transfer the concept to another medium
as you failed to do that youre in breach of the original contract ergo you find yourself in a very actionable position
banky stares at bob even more agog joined by jay
after a beat jay adds yeah
justice now has the advantage over sissy holding her head and kicking her in the face repeatedly screaming
so what do you guys want to go away and take your lady friends with you
shitcan this movie so we dont get called names on the internet anymore
even if theres no movie people are still free to talk shit about you on the internet
thats what the internets for slandering others anonymously
stopping the flick isnt going to stop that
in the background we see justice high kick sissy into the air
well this isnt fair
we went to hollywood i fell in love we stole a monkey we got shot at and got punched in the motherfucking nuts
we aint leaving empty handed
on cue sissy drops from above landing in jays lap
whats up baby
you look good
isnt that your girlfriends enemy
pushing sissy off him get the fuck offa me pig
sissy races at justice leaping atop her pulling her hair
jay bob and banky continue
you guys are gonna ruin my movie career
well we want something for our mental anguish
tell you what well settle this monetarily
ill give you half of what i made
halfs not good enough
fine ill give you two thirds of what i made
fuck you you already said half

silent bob rolls his eyes banky shakes jays hand
done justice throws sissy off onto the floor
both get up facing each other
your shit is so tired justice
call me boo boo kitty fuck bitch
justice high kicks sissy and she goes flying across the stage
sissy sails toward the craft service table landing atop missy and chrissy knocking them out
willenholly stands to see why the girls stopped shooting
beat i think i killed both of them
suddenly he lets out a shriek and falls forward revealing a tranquilizer dart in his ass and suzanne standing behind him holding the gun up in the air
justice surveys her handiwork for a beat then calls off toward the bluntmobile
jay bob and banky pop up from behind the car and join her
yo i was just about to jump in there and get your back
then the sound of sirens rings out in the distance
holy shit the cops
we gotta get out of here
im tired of running
justice lifts willenholly into a sitting position and taps his face
you awake marshal
tries to move but cant oh my god im paralyzed
the monkey shot me in the ass and paralyzed me
oh the irony
off suzannes gun youre not paralyzed
it was just a tranquilizer
tranqued by a little monkey
my friends in the bureau are never gonna let me live this down
you have friends in the f
crying they all made it in but i failed the exam
why the hell else do you think i became a federal wildlife marshal
cause im a joke
justice looks toward the direction of the sirens thinking
then maybe not
i can make you a deal thatll get you into the f
regardless of test scores
what kind of deal
you drop the charges against jay and silent bob and say you never found the ape
make sure the world knows theyre not in control of any c
now wait a second ill explain later jay to willenholly in exchange ill give you the diamonds i stole and turn in sissy missy chrissy and myself
but i want a reduced sentence
youd be willing to do that
off jay for him
id be willing to do anything
justice stands and takes jay by the hands
im an international jewel thief whos facing a jail sentence
im a junkie with a monkey
if i go to prison will you wait for me
i dont know
will we fuck when you get out
justice smiles and kisses jay passionately
the kiss should say it all but dont change the subject
will we fuck when you get out
justice and jay kiss again
suzanne reached up to silent bob who picks her up
she grabs his face and kisses him
willenholly looks to banky
theres a lot of love in the room
regardless of what you may have heard
i do not kiss guys
justice and jay are still kissing until willenholly pulls her away and loads her into the waiting cop car
weve gotta go
to jay friendly hey stop stealing monkeys
willenholly closes the door behind justice and gets in the car
to jay wait for me
jay looks at justice confused as the cruiser pulls away leaving jay bob suzanne and banky
they start walking down the lot
well boys youre rich in love indicating jay well youre in love
and to top that off youve got your own monkey
what more could two guys from jersey possibly want
all those fucks to stop talking shit about us on the internet for starters
what do i keep telling you
theres not much you can do to stop that
well short of showing up at all their houses and beating the shit out of them i guess
jay and bob suddenly freeze
they look at each other and smile
to bob you know with all that money were gonna make we can buy a lotta plane tickets
a passenger jet flies through the sky
jay and bob stand across the street from a house
they check the address on the big ream of paper theyre carrying nod at each other and cross the street
the doorbell rings
a mother answers it to see jay and silent bob standing in the doorway
can i help you
maam does reading of paper william dusky live here
hes my son
may we talk to him please
she walks away
after a beat a fifteen year old kid comes to the door
yo do you post as reading off paper magnolia fan on movie poop shoot
and did you write fuck jay and silent bob
fuck them up their stupid asses
yeah a while ago
jay and bob nod at each other then grab the kid pull him outside and start beating the shit out of him on his front lawn
the passenger jet flies again this time in the opposite direction
jay and bob knocking at another door
another mother answers
they speak she heads inside and another kid comes to the door
on movie poop shoot
did you say jay and silent bob reading off paper are fucking clown shoes
if they were real id beat the shit out of them for being so stupid
really again jay and bob pull the kid outside and beat the shit out of him
jay and bob beat the shit out of a clerk
jay and bob beat the shit out of a woman
jay and bob beat the shit out of a priest
jay and bob beat the shit out of a businessman
the marquee reads jason biggs and james van der beek are the front doors open and the crowd lets out
first we see dante and randal
now that was worse then clash of the titans
i still cant believe judy dench played me
hey remind me to renew that restraining order
because im gonna blast the flick on the internet tonight
steve dave and walt exit
why cant hollywood ever make a decent comic book movie
tellem steve dave
would you stop saying that
alyssa and trish come out
well that was just another paean to male adolescence and its refusal to grow up
yeah sis but it was better than mallrats
at least holden had the good sense to keep his name off of it
why wouldnt miramax option his other comic instead
you know the one he drew about you and him and your relationship
you mean chasing amy
that would never work as a movie
banky and hooper exit
im so fucking embarrassed honey you should be
they took your characters and reduced them to one ninety minute long gay joke
it was like watching batman and robin again
that means a lot coming from the guy who pretends to be shaft as opposed to the guy who takes shaft
i dont hear you complaining nightly
in fact the only thing i do hear you say is yes hooper
cradle the balls and work the shaft
looking around hey
whatd we say
not in public
a guy behind them calls out to banks
nice movie you fucking tracer
recognizing him you
thats right you sonovabitch
im back for round two
banky grabs the guy by the throat and starts choking him while hooper tries to break them up
willenholly exits with justice in hand and leg cuffs and a prison uniform
theyre flanked by two armed prison guards
you know i dont get out to the movies much
but id have to say bluntman and chronic was blunt tastic
are these leg cuffs really necessary
dont make me shoot you justice
and finally jay and silent bob come out
whip pan to morris day and the time on stage performing the bird
during the song morris points to jay and bob who are dancing with suzanne and justice whos still in cuffs flanked by the guards
jay looks to bob they nod at each other and jay and silent bob join morris day and the time onstage and dance us out to the coda which reads
bluntman and chronic strike back went on to make a mere
million at the box office
it was the biggest commercial failure in the history of miramax films
the film was roundly drubbed as a bad idea by the denizens of the internet chat boards and over the course of the next year while they waited for the
quick stop restraining order to expire jay and silent bob tracked them all down and beat the shit out of them
a familiar woman closes a book thats marked the view askewniverse
she puts the book down smiles at us and skips off
