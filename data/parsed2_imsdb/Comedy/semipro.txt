written by scot armstrong june we hear the faint sounds of a crowd cheering on kobe bryant
the real bob costas does narration
before the nba was the nba there was another basketball league in america
documentary footage this is real aba footage
a series of great plays are made by aba stars
from to there was the american basketball association
a maverick minor league that would change the game forever
the aba made the fast break fast
invented the three point shot
and introduced the world to something called the slam dunk contest
documentary footage dr
j launches from the foul line and dunks in the worlds first dunk contest
david thompson finishes an alley oop
singer pat boone owned the oakland oaks
wilt chambelain coached the conquistadors
i myself was the young voice of the st
documentary footage a young bob costas broadcasts from st
louis looking pretty sweet in side burns and a tweed jacket
players like dr
j ice man george gervin and moses malone were as entertaining as they come
but despite the leagues flair convincing fans to show up for games was often a struggle
documentary footage the infamous tv interview where freddy lewis wins a race horse
footage of dime beer night
footage of the kentucky colonials fielding a cheerleader as one of their starting five
for owners promotional ideas became an art form all to themselves
documentary footage the miami ball girls dance in bikinis in truth some of the girls were still in high school
one night the nets went as far as to give a free gerbil to its first fifty fans
there were plenty of punches too giving the national hockey league a run for its money
documentary footage a guy elbows connie hawkins who turns and punches the guy in the face
yes the aba had a style all its own
the hair was big the shorts were short and the ball was red white and blue
documentary footage harry the fat mexican guy dances
in rumors of a merger spread throughout the league
in the end only four teams would join the nba and survive
teams like the kentucky colonels and the virginia squires would disappear forever
but their spirit still lives on to this day
we hear a crowd going crazy
here we present the legend of the aba
exactly as it happened
some funky music plays
except this flint michigan team never existed
and well everything in this movie is completely fake
close on a logo of a basketball with a sombrero on it
welcome to the american basketball association
a fan chugs his beer and throws some guacamole
the crowd screams and curses at monix mid s talented but past his prime
there are three leading characters in this movie
this is the old rock
think nolte in hours
cosner in durham
newman in slap shot
the amigos are up by one here
theyll need to find a way to stop monix
he checks the clock waits
and now drives the lane
monix suddenly takes a huge hit totally slammed by a big asshole petrelli
he flies into the crowd everyone erupts screaming with glee
ooh monix gets taken out hard
some tough love from patrelli
wheres the foul on that
that was all ball
covering mic screaming jesus christ leonard
let them play for once
this aint fuckin greenpeace
some might say that was a close call but these referees have done a nice job tonight
these refs suck
still stuck in the crowd
monix struggles to get back on the court
the crowd shoves him around twisting his ankle slapping him
the crowd is nuts
hey monix want a sip
monix is confused until the woman throws the beer in his face
smart ass oops
she and her friends laugh
monix says nothing
instead he holds his aching back and limps up to the foul line annoyed
sorry monix i got pushed
well it looks like the amigos are in trouble here
monix is a ninety percent shooter if he can hit both of these free throws its over
monix performs his ancient free throw ritual three dribbles and a quick spin of the ball
but he misses
again monix ignores the drunk lady
they dodged a bullet there
but monix still has one last chance to tie it up
monix focuses on his ritual again
monix aims at the basket about to shoot but then suddenly re nailing the girl and the second free throw sails wide
he just pegged a chick
thats the greatest thing ive ever seen
the lady runs on court and attacks monix her boyfriend jumps in monix hits her boyfriend with some quick hockey punches
the benches clear everyone is punching everybody
re violent fist fight and weve got a little bit of pushing and shoving under the basket
what do you make of this lou
im goin in
lou redwood takes his headphones off climbs over the announcers table and jumps into the fight
more on this amigo victory right after this message from colt
monix is beat up pretty bad
he dabs his cut with toilet paper
schnack the owner carries a six pack of schlitz
ill take two
schnack hands them over
monix might speak but he drinks instead
the trade went through
you know youre not exactly a spring chicken anymore

that score board
angle on pieces of an old scoreboard are crammed into the back of the locker room
its a magnovox

jackie drives in his car practicing for the meeting
tries to build some confidence
into the rear view very well hello commissioner why sure i would love one of your puerto rican cigars oh i know im a legitimate owner you dont have to
tell me that were merging with the nba
oh thats nice ha ha ha
good one commish
a brick building on the outskirts of indianapolis
a sign says
welcome aba owners
jackie pulls into the lot and parks
he looks in the mirror one last time
your mom would be proud of you today
not quite rich guys surround a large oak table
jackie is by far the youngest of the owners
im sure each of you have heard the rumors
and im here to tell you the rumors are true
the aba will be merging with the nba at the end of this season
to an old guy fists to the ceiling our league is sold
and the nba agreed to all of our financial demands
now jackie turns inward more quietly intense
this is without question the greatest moment of his life
to himself youre a real owner
youre in the four of our teams will be absorbed into the nba family the rest of you will terminate operations
you know it
now hearing im sorry wait what
the nuggets the nets the spurs and the pacers will play in the nba next year
the rest of us will dissolve
dissolve like how
how do i dissolve into the nba
the winning owners look at each other not sure how to handle jackie
im sorry jackie
we all know how
emotional you get
we waited until the very last second to tell you
jackie pounds the table
he kicks over his chair
we know youre upset jackie
but youll be very well compensated
everyones agreed to a very large sum
i dont want a sum
i want my team
to the losing owners cmon you guys youre not going to just sit here and take the money are you
to winning owners what do the spurs have that we dont
a huge fan base
a brand new stadium
a solid economic growth package including strong tax incentives
oh cmon thats bullshit
the nba is taking four teams jackie theres nothing i can do
jackie goes quiet thinking
an epic idea hits him
the best four teams should go
forget the huge fan base the stadiums the economic
a little lost growing
correcting him economic growth pack to the room the four teams with the best records should merge
yeah thats the fairest way
these four teams do have the best records
flints only won six games all year
the season isnt over
yeah maybe we should finish the season first
this plan sounds like a lot of fun but its too late
the commissioner me has already decided
actually the terms of a merger can only be approved by a league mandate
what he said
i move that we vote on the terms of the merger
the team sits around the parking lot sitting on their duffle bags dejected
jackie is having a team meeting
cmon you guys lets try to stay psyched
this is a chance to become a real nba franchise
theres no way we can make it to fourth place
its mathematically impossible
i ran the numbers
all we have to do is win about eighty two percent of our remaining games
eighty two percent
isnt that a lot
we just gotta start hitting our threes
guys look around unsure listen i know this seems like bad news but it doesnt have to be
this is a big road trip for us
weve just got to start playing solid flint basketball
i dont know
we suck man
re the slap sorry
we do not suck okay
we just have to want it
pumped jackie walks around with his hands on his hips
what do you think monix
all eyes turn on the grumpy one
i think we suck
see now theres some team unity
now lets load up the jet
reveal a shitty school bus has the words the jet
spray painted in graffiti letters with a palm tree next to it
as they load up now weve got a special treat
you know i take care of my family
today the jet is catered
i had downtowns mom pack us some hot dish
quincys hot dish
the guys load up
its so packed its ridiculous
everyone tries to stuff their gear somewhere and sit down
jackie carries a big pot of hot dish accidentally burning scootsies back
ah watch the hot dish man
hey jackie theres some dude out there wants to talk to you
pov out the window we can see dukes the full court shot winner holding his giant check and looking into the bus
hes still shirtless with a star spangled headband
jackie and dukes are next to the bus discussing the check
i tried jackie
they wont take it
they said its symbolic
what does symbolic mean
i dont know
but they said i need a real check
i dont know what your bank is talking about
that is a real check
i signed it myself
its written in glitter dude
cant you just give me like a regular sized one
i dont get it
people are usually able to cash these
maybe you should try another bank
trying to wrap it up if you run into any more trouble let me know
okay jackie thanks man
any time congratulations
jackie turns away from dukes and exhales walking back to the bus
were flying down the highway
kong the small asian player is driving singing along with jackie to the radio
singing randy newman
jackie reaches up into a special bin and takes out some beef jerky then yells out the window
out the window at a car pan back to see the whole team crammed into tiny seats
vakidis has his knees pointing straight toward the ceiling
twiggy munson is reading s pornography
clarence is sewing a new name onto his jersey
the rest of the guys are eating their hot dish
so clarence whats in this hot dish anyway
my mom cooked your ass a whole damn meal why you gotta go asking whats in it
its a compliment
if its good then its good
why do you gotta know whats in it
whats in hot dish
hot dish is in hot dish asshole
bee bee and scootsie look over the seat facing them
hey monix what were the celtics like
they were fast
no ones faster than me
i should be on the celtics
pointing to his mind fast up here
youre supposed to be mr
whyd you get bounced
well you have to be able to jump too
hey let us see that ring again
not right now okay twiggy
isnt it a little embarrassing wearing that thing everyday
you call yourself a celtic
you sat through every single playoff game
you didnt see action once
and now you walk around wearing the ice like youre bill russel
well you aint
oh youre just jealous
yeah monix played solid minutes for lots of teams
hes played in the nba thats more than you can say
at least i never sat on the bench and then called myself a champion
you didnt do shit for that celtic team
if i was dave cowens id yank that ring right off your neck
that was a pretty heated exchange
monix looks like hes got something to say but he doesnt
clarence has the last word
he doesnt wear it on his finger because he knows he didnt earn it
he didnt even play
monix looks out the window
the jet is parked outside the arena
were just a few minutes away from game one of the tropics game road trip
with talk of an nba merger hitting the league theres a new electricity surrounding tonights game
jackie addresses his team before tip off
now a lot of people out there are writing us off
a lot people are saying things like jackie moon is an offensive liability
theyre saying flints turnovers led to sixty fast break points per game
making this up theyre saying bee bees retarded brother is so retarded that his eyes look too big
like a french bulldog
no one said that man
trying to motivate yes they did
and were going to use it as motivation okay
this is game jackie moon sprints across the floor tries to get two f eet planted in the lane
its not even close jackie has taken a guy down hard
the ref whistles a blocking foul
wheres the charge father pat
both feet werent planted
thats it youre out
what did i say
jackie takes a ball and drop kicks it punting it high up into the rafters
game monix drives the lane fast and smart a no look pass hits scootsie double day in the shoulder
game clarence and bee bee jog back on defense
i aint guarding my guy anymore
hes toodamn sweaty man
re his wet uniform look at me
well i aint guarding him
monix notices this discussion
quit talking and play defense
the sweaty guy backs in on clarence posting up top
game jackie moon plays great defense rejecting a shot
monix grabs the ball and dribbles on a fast break
clarence trails in perfect position
im open baby
try a behind the back
monix delivers a nice two handed bounce pass but clarence isnt ready for anything fundamentally sound the ball hits him in the nuts
angle on a big hotel with fancy lights but then we pan to reveal a shitty motel
the jet is parked at the cheap place
two twin beds in a crap box motel room
monix has the phone to his ear but it just keeps ringing
hed leave a message for lynn but answering machines havent been invented yet
he hangs up looks in the mirror and now takes his championship ring necklace off
he looks at the ring in his hand
and shoves it into his duffle bag
i brought us some ice
monix is startled
clarence his roommate for the night enters
i dont know its free
clarence takes some ice pops it in his mouth and starts crunching
now bee bee enters yet another player in the small room
that root beer machine took my fucking change man
white people are assholes
monix ignores this
laying back he focuses on the tv the celtics are playing
their trapping defense is a thing of beauty
clarence walks over and flicks the channels until he stops at love american style
you turned off the celtics
i dont watch people play basketball
they watch me
with that clarence pulls out a joint and lights it
re the marijuana what the hell is that
as he inhales its a fucking egg mcmuffin
monix opens the window clearing the pot smoke out of his face
jackie exits the bathroom having just taken a shower
hes wearing a very small robe
this is now the fourth player whos sleeping in this tiny room
why dont you shower in your room
my wife is using it
ill be crashing with you guys tonight
as he eats ice re tv love american style
turn it up
jackie doesnt say a word about the pot
instead he keeps his eyes glued to the tv then reaches for the joint and smokes jackie have you ever even slept with your wife
are you kidding
try like every weekend
shes so hot
sounds like a great arrangement
you guys need to wake up
quit living like its the s man
live it up
showing off hey clarence lets have some of that smoke bro
im pretty sure we have a game tomorrow
as he inhales this stuff wont affect you
jackie finishes inhaling then holds it out for monix
he stares at the joint then around the room at his teammates
well if this is really going to be my life i might as well be stoned like everyone else
monix takes the stupid joint
the instant monix inhales he what the hell is this
what do you mean
take that back
take what back
his mom grows it
yeah in the yard
your mom grew this
its sweet grass
well im finished thanks
whats wrong my moms weed aint good enough for you
i guess not
cmon man have some respect for his moms weed
thats it i aint sleeping in the same bed as this motherfucker
television cameras are being set up
a camera man cleans the lens
jackie studies the cameras mesmerized by the idea of television
he speaks with the amigos manager
you want all the fans to sit on one side of the stadium
yeah just move all those people over to this side
see the tv cameras are going to face this way right
well if we fill the seats on that side well look sold out
actually thats not a bad idea
meanwhile on the court both teams are warming up
clarence now has a new name on his jersey
there are so many words there is barely space for a number
its a mess
re jersey new name check it out
i sewed it on the bus
struggling to read it whats it say
jumping johnny johnson
the asshole petrelli wanders over near the tropics side of the court
yo granny yarn barn hows the needle point going
kiss my ass petrelli
re the jersey name hey man i think you spelled flint sucks balls wrong
this guys the next betsy ross
arent you clarence
the guys laugh
monix walks up defending his teammate
no one calls him clarence
his name whats your name
jumping johnny johnson
his names jumping johnny johnson
nose to nose you got that
jackie hurries over
alright break it up
to his team everyone huddle up
where is he walking to
listen up were on national tv tonight
and you all know what that means the league needs a good clean game
oh thats a bunch of dog shit
you guys want to merge or not
because the fastest way to screw this up is to start punching people in the face while the commissioner is at home watching the game with his kids
children are very impressionable
their minds are not yet soiled by the cruel realities of this world
behind the huddle fans begin walking right across the court
both teams turn to watch this strange thing
the amigos manager leads the herd jackie helps out directing them across to the other side
the optical illusion has worked
the game does indeed look crowded
the game is in full swing
this sold out crowd is loving this one the amigos up by twenty six here in the second
monix drains a nice jumper but out of nowhere petrelli the guy we hate throws a hard shoulder knocking monix to the floor
thats a moving pick father pat
monix cant believe it
petrelli taunts monix
whats wrong monix cat got your nads
monix faces off
not with the cameras
miming the commish hes watching
monix looks around and thinks
what about commercials
commercials what about commercials
jackie thinks about this then nods good idea
i like it
time out ref
a time out on the floor left before the half the amigos the tropics well be right back after this message from shasta
the cameras on air red light turns off
rooting them on and
the commissioner relaxes at home with his two kids
a shasta commercial is on tv
on tv i want a pop
i want a shasta
and were back in monix punches petrelli petrelli punches monix monix punches petrelli monix ducks and punches cuing the announcers welcome back to the aba game of the week
players hold their heads in pain
others limp back to the bench
the camaraderie and spirit of this league is on full display here tonight
off camera monix delivers a secret punch to patrellis spleen
jackie runs the half time talk standing in front of the chalk board
okay solid first half guys but were going to have to make some monix interrupts jackie pissed
he addresses the team stepping in front of jackie moon
this is bullshit guys
theyre kicking our ass in basketball and theyre kicking our ass during the commercials too
does anybody here understand the concept of the pick and roll
because theyre going to keep double teaming at the top of the key until somebody rotates the damn ball
rotate the ball
monix looks at this group and gets even madder
does anyone in this room have any pride
dont you realize this is thelast four weeks of basketball anyus are ever going to play
is thishow were really going togo out
youd think wed want toend ourcareers battling hustling after every loose ball
boxing out under the boards
setting picks for our teammates
but we havent done shit out there
twiggy munson and scootsie double day hang their heads
were a bunch of selfish assholes and ive got news for you we arent going to finish in fourth were going to finish dead last
monix paces in front of the guys a man possessed
one day youre going to look back on your life
and youre going to look back on this time
and youre going to realize
monix is staring right at clarence
and clarence is actually listening
youre going to realize you never even played basketball
a moment of silence after the intensity
monix waddles to the door
now you guys have fun out there in the second half
if anyone needs me ill be in the training room draining my knee
monix limps off everyones head is hanging low
of course hes right
but what the hell are we supposed to do about it
we dont even have plays
were back in flint
jackie is back in his office speaking on the phone
into phone dukes
i dont make the rules
if they cant cash it maybe youll have to go out of state
i would if i could but if i give you another check that would be two checks
that would be not ten
what are you trying to pull here
the other line rings ive got to take this other call dukes
hits a button answering flint tropics hot line
oh hey commish
on the floor instead of a basketball court the stadium holds an ice rink
a welcome to the flint ice capades sign is being removed
the entire basketball team is on their hands and knees assembling the hard wood
this is a lot of work
clarence hits his thumb with a hammer
why do we have to put the court together
i guess the ice capades sold out
yeah kids love that stuff
although i find the wild life masks realistic and frightening
monix should be here helping us
the guys look up to find jackie
he does not look happy
the commissioner just called
i looks like weve got ourselves a situation
weve got some new terms and conditions for this merger deal
whatd he say
basically weve got to average at least fans per home game for the rest of the year
every home game
he said the nba will only take a franchise that has fans
winning is going to be hard
but getting people to watch is going to be impossible
lets try and stay positive
my mother always believed flint was a town of destiny
and i believe that
now ive already started work on a huge idea to promote us
what kind of huge idea
jackies place is empty
monix is drinking alone totally blasted in the middle of the day
he hangs his head barely able to order
two more johnny walkers
and another pack of kools
you could use some fresh air monix
you want to take a nap in the back of my truck
just the drinks and the smokes alright
do you have any idea where lynn is these days
she asked me to tell you to quit going to her house
well tell her thats just fine with me
well well well look who it is
to the bartender brian id like you to meet jumping johnny downtown funky stuff boner time finger blast fag erton
to the bartender johnny for short
to brian re monix two coffees
so what brings you to the the kremlin
listen i know you and i havent always been the best of buddies
but ive been thinking about what you said the other night
this is gonna be our last chance
if im ever going to get into the nba its going to be with the tropics
i hate to break it to you clarence but the tropics will never play in the nba
so maybe we wont
but like you said i dont want to look back on this with any regrets
i know what you think of me
but im willing to put our differences aside
im telling you right now ill do whatever it takes to win
you mean like pass
with a smile i would consider passing yes
even if i wanted to play harder this knee wont let me
im not just talking about you playing point guard
im talking about you teaching us
monix could not be less interested
monix you know more about basketball than any man whos ever set foot in flint
monix drinks not into it
all im saying is instead of getting so pissed off at us all the time why not just show us what the hell youre talking about
coach us a little
i mean we cant get any worse
and why should i give a shit about the tropics
i know you
youve got all that basketball shit stored up in your head
i know youre dying to pass it down to somebody
why not us
what about jackie
hes the coach
jackies got his hands full trying to sell tickets
looking up re tv on tv the tropics are performing a video not unlike the super bowl shuffle
each member takes a turn rapping dancing around wooden palm trees with a smile
rapping badly we are the tropics hooping crew running and gunning and dunking on you but were not here to talk no trash were just here to do the tropical
mash this is the worst video ever made
all the guys boogie around until clarence steps forward taking focus
rapping badly im johnny johnson and i got the moves if you try and stop me ill just get smooth rapping badly my name is kong and i aint five
feet but i get more ass than a toilet seat this is my team so get to know them if you get near the lane ill yank your scrotum
we are the tropics hooping crew running and gunning and dunking too were not here to talk no trash were just here to do the tropical mash the ball girls
trot out and boogie with them
theyre not here to talk no trash theyre just here to do the tropical mash monix cant believe his eyes
either can the bartender
monix ignores clarence
to the bartender two more johnny walkers
so thats the way its going to be
monix doesnt answer he just drinks
clarence gets the hint and walks out
monix looks like shit laying on the couch as if he hasnt moved for days
apparently hes been drinking and smoking but not much else
someones at the door
reveal lynn lets herself in
monix is so depressed he is non plused
looking good monix
quincy told me the tropics asked you to coach them
lynn is draining monixs knee
it looks painful
i know what it takes to be a real team lynn
re his knee stay still
and thats the reason you wont coach them
it doesnt matter
the truth is i hate basketball right now
do you really hate basketball
or do you hate yourself
why would i hate myself
well for one you cheated on me
you hate me for that
lynn just stares at him
okay maybe i hate myself a little
you dont wear the ring around your neck anymore
no response where is it
i rode the bench through the playoffs lynn
monix that was greatest moment of your career
and you look back on it like some kind of embarrassment
riding the bench was the greatest moment of my career
you did more than ride the bench monix
what else did i do
every practice you took your team to the limit
i know you did
i was the one draining this stupid knee of yours every night
the celtics were practicing against you monix
and when you ran that scout team you were running milwaukees offense better than their first stringers ever could
lynn continues the business of disposing fluid into the toilet and preparing another syringe
by game time your team knew where milwaukee was going to be before their own players did
the celtics made the right adjustments to win that series
and those adjustments came from you
so i should be proud of running the scout team
dave cowens put that ring in the palm of your hand
and he told you to wear it with pride because you were a champion
and he meant it too
he was being a nice guy
the bench is the bench
your whole life youve bitched about people playing selfish
it takes a team to win right
but when youre on the team your effort doesnt count
is that it
if you werent on the celtics that year would they have won it
watch that needle
would they have won
i dont know
yes you do
monix looks away for a moment
why are you doing this
what does any of this matter anyway
whats it matter
youre drinking yourself to death
god i wish i hated you as much as you hate yourself
lynn throws the needle
monix dodges it
i made sacrifices
how many years did i support you
and finally after all of our blood and sweat and bullshit together you got there monix
you made it you won an nba championship ring
it wasnt just about you okay
and im sick of you acting like youre some kind of joke
you didnt blow it
youre not a fraud
youre not a fake champion
and all the time we spent together fighting for you to get to that moment was not a waste
youre a champion you asshole
but if you want to drink yourself to death go ahead
with that lynn is gone
monix stands alone in the bathroom then checks his knee
but this isnt basketball its dance practice
the entire team performs a complicated intro dance
and and and and turn like you mean it bee bee arch that back
now the waterfall
one by one each dips down like a waterfall
and now a leg kick
nice leg kick kong
those flexible hips are a coachs dream
now big finish and freeze
and then we start the game after that
are we going to practice or what
this is practice okay clarence
we need to get two thousand people in here
our intro dance has to blow peoples minds
he begins pacing around more passionate than ever
from now on i want our afros bigger
i want our shorts shorter
were going to pull our tube socks up higher than we ever have before
the team seems to be looking off screen
reveal monix has been watching this whole thing
with monix on the court everyone feels kind of stupid
hey youre back
listen you should probably chalk your hands up for this number
jackie i asked monix to coach us
jackie is totally thrown by this
he looks around at the team
clearly a decision has been made
what do you mean coach
truly hurt what is this
whats going on
staring his team down its a mutiny
dont be like that
hold on a second
last time i checked we didnt live in flint russia
we live in flint america
im coach until a new one is elected
dont make us elect monix man
jackie moon holds firm alright show of hands
who wants monix to step in as player coach
everyone feels bad but they all raise their hands
please god no
starting to cry its cool
i get it
im a big boy i can handle it
jackie cries harder
dont take it so hard jackie
youre a great owner
we all know that
did you just say great owner
everyone thinks so
now when you said great owner were you just saying that
because its not cool to mess with me about this
we mean it
monix is just more of an xs and os kind of guy thats all
jackie is emotional
its a bittersweet moment
he takes off his whistle then walks over and hands monix his whistle
re the whistle here
you may need this
now he pulls out a bunch of crazy notes on loose paper written in ball point pen
the pages look insane
handing him papers and here are some ideas for plays ive jotted down
to the team the way i see it any team in this league can put together a run
most of our opponents are all flash
if we play unselfish fundamental basketball we can win games
i like it
unselfish meaning tough team defense full and half court traps boxing your man out to help the team rebound
unselfish means sprinting up the floor on every fast break not because you can get a dunk and get your dick sucked after the game but because if you sprint
up the floor you might pull the defense out of position and free a teammate up for a high percentage shot
wait so whats going on with the blow jobs
i vote we keep the blow jobs
raising his hand all in favor
everyone raises their hands in favor of blow jobs
would everyone let the man talk please
clarence is serious
this shuts everyone up
the starters have gotten into position guarded by the scout team in blue jerseys
the most important work we do on the court is away from the basketball
monix flips open a switch blade knife and stabs the ball deflating it
this gets everyones attention
re deflated ball until you start moving like a real team you practice without a ball
he flings the deflated ball into the bleachers and snaps the knife closed
alright clarence run the offense
i dont get it
set a pick for somebody
clarence jogs over and stands next a scout team opponent
okay thats kind of a pick i guess
try standing on the other side of scootsies man so you free him up to cut into the lane
monix corrects clarence moving his body the way he wants him to stand
widen your stance
plant your feet
now scootsie go
set a pick for jackie
scootsie cuts across the lane
the team slowly gets i rotating faster
now jackie pick bee bees man and rotate to the rim like this
everyone move to the open space
and clarence you swing back out up top
theyve completed the play
monix stands there smiling
the players look at each other whats the big deal
you know what that was
a flash to the high side post with an outside screen and a back door cut
lets do it again
hey how come you dont have to run with us
youre a player just like the rest of us
im saving my knee for the games
clarence sets a screen for scootsie and they perform the same basic rotation
as they run were not just rotating were clearing out making space
a pass and cut can change defensive match ups
creating seams can give us back door looks
down screens can make a team vulnerable to penetration
whats up with all of these fucked up words man
yeah what are we building some kind of basketball space
you dont have to understand it yet
just run it again
you heard me again
its many hours later
the team is still doing the exact same thing
nothing in their moves have changed at all
weve been running this play for a long time man
yeah maybe we could try like play number two
were running this play
were running this play until we puke
basically we have
yeah im pretty beat
until we puke is not a figure of speech
we are literally going to puke
what does he mean by literally
i think hes talking about vomit
monix can i talk to you for
jackie hangs his head but then accepts his fate
as they run we need to get in shape fellas
and we need to learn some fundamentals quick
they run it again getting more and more winded
i want you to be brain dead
because someday youre going to be too tired or too nervous to think again
and when you are this is the play im going to call
the play that your lungs and legs will have memorized
we will be able to run this in our sleep
clarence tries to gag himself with his fingers
no sticking your fingers down your throat clarence i saw that
youre going to puke
and its going to be all natural again
we pan along a row of toilet stalls
behind the doors each player is throwing up
jackie is the last player left
he crawls across the gym floor dying
monix screams down at his deflated body
get up and run
youre going to puke like everybody else
monix i need to talk to you
talk after you puke
jackie cant get up but he crawls dying
i cant puke monix
yes you can
jackie crawls harder along the hardwood
you dont understand
ive never thrown up in my life
what are you talking about
ive never puked
that makes no sense
everyone has thrown up before
i swear to god
i can eat anything
i can drink anything
ive been sick but ive never puked
i swear to god
keep moving youre going to puke
i dont puke
i cant do it
its the truth
i swear on my mothers grave
at this point monix cant help but be intrigued
what about when you were a baby
babies throw up all the time
my mom said i never did
she said i was fascinating
you can call my dad
ive never puked
when jackie looks up at monix its clear he is not lying
isnt that kind of dangerous
what do you mean
what happens if you swallow poison
i dont know
i ate bad sausage before
but nothing happened
jackie manages to stand up
have you ever been punched in the jejunum
i dont know
whats a jejunum
its part of your small intestine
i dont know
i doubt ecu monixs knowing fist digs deep under jackies rib cage
its the hardest punch ever filmed
on jackies reaction he stands beyond pain empty of any possible air
the blood leaves his face andhis eyesbecome confused watering strangely
part of jackies brain wants tospeak buthe feelsunhuman his lips separate only slightly
he wanders out of frame
to the sky mom
monix stands in the doorway watching this
jackie is about to speak but then takes stock of his feelings
there is now an air of tranquility about him
hes almost euphoric
an intense game is underway
the flint team works hard away from the ball
as the monix voice over continues we watch the team move just like in practice
monix is playing too
note the team also looks hot
clarence plays with an even bigger afro
jackie moon sports a large perm striped tube socks and the whitest thighs youve ever seen
on offense we share the ball
we look for the easy pass not the spectacular pass
jackie rolls off the pick and looks for it
for the first time in this sequence we see the ball
clarence has a clear passing lane he feeds jackie for a lay up
if a guys more open than you are he gets the ball
instead of celebrating clarence hustles back on defense
the tropics execute a half court trap
as we watch monix play we continue to the voice over from practice
on defense were going to learn to play together
were going to use team traps to pressure people into turnovers
on the in bounds monix and jackie moon trap an opponent
monix slaps the ball free
he flips to clarence who fakes the fast break dunk and dishes to scootsie
can you believe that
jumping johnny johnson actually passed the ball
it was a great pass too
the other team calls time out
and jackie moon has made several great defensive plays down the stretch
i tell you jackies not afraid to knock people around in the lane
hes a monster
like a retard in a china shop
a twenty second time out on the floor monix huddles them up
huddling up listen up
ill in bound
clarence protect the ball and penetrate if you can
kick it out to scootsie or me and everyone crash the boards hard
looking good were thirty seconds away from taking this one home
lets bring it in
hes right guys
but remember we want to win but not by too much
we dont want to win by too much
what the hell is he talking about
hes worried about the corn dogs
if we score a hundred points everyone gets a free corn dog
there are signs everywhere
im sorry monix but we dont even have corn dogs
i dont give a shit
were taking it to them
were up by seven monix
cant we just take it easy
were talking about a lot of corn dogs here
there could be a riot
i dont give a shit about the corn dogs okay
we play hard every second
were running the offense
everyone got that
the tropics are just one bucket away from the magic number
listen to this crowd
they know whats at stake a free corn dog
monix has the ball in his hands
he in bounds to clarence
clarence penetrates and kicks it to scootsie
scootsie has an open look
he sizes up a jumper
look at this jackie moon has just blocked his own teammates shot
ive never seen this before
vakidis takes it up strong to the basket
he gets taken out hard by the coach
the ball bounces into the air rolls around the rim
and and the basket is
the daiquiri room is crowded with guys
jackie is having a team meeting
i asked you up to the daiquiri room because this is a private matter
everyone looks around as you know i threw up recently
it was the first time in my life
and well its made me feel
i guess you could say ive got a new clarity in life
everyone stares back since vomiting on wednesday ive been facing my demons
im not going to be an imposter any more
and i want you to know i just mailed out corn dog coupons
and id like to bring somebody special in
dukes walks in
he is still shirtless
jackie hands him a duffel bag
in this bag is ten thousand dollars
actually its twenty three hundred
but im going to pay you the rest
the tropics will not let you down
from now on i want my conscience clear
can i confess something to everyone
its something ive never told anybody
what is it
you know my song love me sexy
everyone knows that song
i stole it
turns away dramatic my mom wrote it
three weeks before she died
and i stole it
even monix is fascinated by this
wait your mom wrote that
was she a singer
no she wrote it on a napkin
i duped the whole world
im nothing but a fraud
its true im a famous singer
and ive landed the hottest wife in the world
but to be honest we usually only sleep together once a year
on vj day
ignoring kong and even on that day i dont feel like its me whos sleeping with her
what does that mean
she married me because of my song but i didnt write it
so sometimes i feel like its not even me whos with her
more emotional deep down i feel like its really my mom who is making love to her
when i hold lucys supple breasts in my hands they are my moms hands
when i eat a pair of edible panties off of her they are my moms teeth
thats pretty weird
im living in a prison dukes
why dont you write a song yourself
then you wouldnt feel like a fake any more
i could never write anything as brilliant as love me sexy
standing tall listen to me tropics
today is a new day
i am going to be the greatest basketball owner youve ever seen
and were going to make it to fourth place

after dancing a bit the bear is still motionless
tapping the bear cmon dewie

to the handler to clarence
screaming at the bear in italian asta zittusto parcnuso spumoni
to clarence climbing in screw this im stopping it
the bear handler tries to get into the ring with a stick and loop
but clarence tries to push the bear handler back out of the ring
the first round is over but the bear does not return to his corner
the tropics play awesome
and its another sell out crowd for the flint michigan tropics
taking it strong to the rim is coffee black
this sold out crowd is going nuts
youve been a little quiet lou how are you doing
a mexican stole my bike
the team celebrates the win
and believe it or not the flint tropics are in perfect position to qualify for the nba merger
if they win their final game theyll clinch fourth place
but nothing is ever easy against the first place san antonio spurs
as jackie does a victory dance the commissioner approaches
oh hey commish
good game huh
and a packed house too
i need to talk to you
and the rest of your team
the whole team stands solemnly
im sorry but even if you beat the spurs on friday we just cant have an nba franchise in flint
what are you saying
its just not good business
flint isnt a big enough media market okay
this stadium is small and frankly it needs to be torn down before someone gets hurt
im sorry but nobody ever thought you guys could ever get this far
well tough shit
this team did make it this far
rules are rules
rules are rules
until the expansion committee makes new rules
then those rules are the rules
everyone looks at each other
jackies brain has slipped into a deep trance
he is no longer inside his body
dont take this personally jackie
these other teams have strong markets new stadiums
its just not going to happen for you flint boys
the devastation of what is happening is palpable
nothing has ever hurt this bad before
i know youre going to punch me jackie
so lets just get it over with
the commissioner stands brave eyes closed chin out
jackie is too confused and devastated to hit anything
he stumbles out of the room like a zombie
the team follows
the commissioner opens his eyes
a long silent beat
to himself how did i get out of that one
suddenly kong darts in and squeezes the commissioners balls with a kung fu grip
the team files out into the parking lot totally devastated
this cant be happening
they cant just do this can they
we can get a lawyer dude
we can fight this
monix just looks to the ground as in its over
jackie opens his mouth
he tries to speak but he cant
are you crying
i dont know
contorting his face im trying to
looking to the sky i wish i could just puke this away
to monix do it to my jejunum monix
but monix is leaving
he turns and walks off alone down the dark street
the others walk away too
where is everyone going
clarence walks alone along the river
in an american basketball association policy shift it seems the flint tropics will not be playing for an nba birth after all
bee bee ellis stands in the middle of the tropics court upset
jackie walks sad along the streets of flint now he suddenly picks up a pipe and smashes the windsheild of an innocent truck
he turns and tackles a garbage can
fridays match up against the first place san antonio spurs will be the tropics final basketball game
scootsie double day finishes spray painting the words bullshit on a wall
reveal he is in his own childs nursery room
the baby starts crying
the tropical aisle guys are fat and shirtless burning their hawaiian shirts outside the stadium
and if that news wasnt bad enough for the tropics weve just been informed that coffee black the teams top scorer has been traded to the spurs
at least someone from flint is on his way to the nba next year
monix is back on his bar stool drinking and smoking its been a long night
now clarence enters the kremlin
and makes the long walk over to sit next to monix
thought i might find you here
long beat i got traded
yeah i heard
i guess the san antonio spurs are picking up the players they want before were eligible for the expansion draft
coffee black going to the nba
they wont let me finish out with the tropics
so well be playing against each other in the last game
thats pretty weird
it wont be weird
the game doesnt count
listen im sorry about dont be sorry
i mean i just want to say that this year you really dont
clarence stares at him
then eventually stands up to leave
there are a million things he wants to say but he says this we worked so hard
well it was all for nothing
so thats just it then
thats just it
clarence shakes his head and walks out
the morning sun shines down on the sad town of flint
monix walks home in the street
he stops and takes a leak right in the middle of the road
a car honks at him to get out of the way then skids to a stop
lynn pokes her head out of the car
what the fuck are you doing
monix is on the couch drunk
he gazes at the tv and swigs his beer
now lynn walks in
i thought the deal was you were going to sleep
so youre just going to sit here in my house and drink for the entire day
you got a problem with that
yeah i do
maybe you could put some pants on and go piss off somebody else
fine maybe i will
where are my pants
tell me something monix no
whatwereyou trying to accomplish thisyear
you never really gave a shitaboutthat nba merger did you
monix doesnt say anything
the merger monix did you ever care about it
monix still stays quiet
tell me if you didnt care about the merger what the hell were you playing for
i wanted fourth place
that was the whole fucking thing
well guess what
fourth place is still sitting there waiting for you to win it
monix doesnt look at her
think about it
a wide shot of an alley
we hear a familiar voice off screen
singing bizarre baby who wants to love me sexy
baby ugh are you ready to lick me sexy
inside a dumpster reveal jackie lays in garbage and sings up to the sky
its official he has lost his mind
tweaking the lyrics im a big faker and i stole this song ly sexy
im the biggest failure in the world ly sexy
im going to kill my self y sexy
bee bee ellis hears jackie voice and discovers him in laying the garbage
jackie ignores his teammate
im going to hang myself with an extension cord y sexy
what the hell are you doing in a dumpster
ignoring bee bee i am urinating in my pants right now
you gotta get it together man
monix called a team meeting
the entire team has gathered
monix addresses them
we all know that clarence has been traded
and we all know that this game doesnt matter anymore right
well ive got news for you
this game does matter
it matters because this is the last real basketball game any of us is ever going to play
the guys nod solemn
tomorrow night i say we leave it all out there on the floor
because theres nothing else for us to save it for
clarence or no clarence
nba or no nba
merger or no merger
we decided we are going to win fourth place
and thats what were going to do
jackie is moved
the guys look at each other and nod
over the past five weeks weve become a team
and that is no small thing
jackie have you ever been on a real team before
how does it feel
it feels pretty good
all your lives youve dreamed of playing in the nba
well guess what
tomorrow night you are
youre playing an nba team
and for one night the world is going to know that you belong
look i tried to pretend like it didnt matter to me if we made it to fourth or not
monix turns inward speaking with an emotion that is pure
but the truth is i want this more than anything ive ever wanted in my whole fucked up life
and i think you do too
i think you can taste it
because we earned this
we made this happen
and were four quarters away from making our dreams come true
to the team pumped they jump around ready to make their own history
a sports show host is interviewing jackie
the spurs may be the team in the league but theyre going to have to prove it on friday night
since this game doesnt count jackie
what exactly is your motivation
with a gleam in his eye we
re going to win this game because we want it
its as simple as that
that alone should make people want to show up and root for us
jackie and the announcer look at each other for a long moment of silence
plus this is the flint michigan
save your ticket stubs the mega bowl is an historic event
im not sure i understand
its a mega bowl
whats not to understand
this game has no effect on the mega bowl trophy is twelve feet high
and it is glorious
im sorry but this sounds like something you just made up
well i didnt
well it doesnt make any sense
theyre just words
youre just words
directly at camera the sun rises above the city
in the morning light flint looks almost electric
the parking lot is rocking
the whole town is jazzed for the big event
if the commissioner is listening i recommend he stay out of the city of flint tonight
hes not too popular in this town
i will stab him in the stomach with an eight inch hunting knife
there were many wild protests in flint this week
but it seems like the whole city is now focused on beating the san antonio spurs
this team seems to have captured every heart in this town of underdogs
people have poured in from around the state to support this drive toward their first mega bowl championship
clarence is getting dressed in the visitors locker room
he holds up a spurs jersey and now pulls the strange colors over his head
the flint tropics will be playing without their number one scorer coffee black tonight
the spurs have signed several new players from around the aba locking them in before they hit the free market in next years expansion draft
the big man pete petrelli has been sent over from the dismantled anaheim amigos
now petrelli enters frame
the guy we hate has been traded to the spurs too
we may be teammates but i still think youre a dick
wheelchair darren and jody take their positions next to the court
dukes sits in the stands
quincy wears a new fur coat sitting center court
the tropical aisle cheers rowdy
the ball girls look almost nervous
you can feel the excitement
and now entering by herself standing in the back is lynn
she takes a deep breath
monix addresses the team
you want to know what i love
the eleven of us right here right now waiting for the biggest game of our lives to begin
i want you to remember something
i want you to remember what this feels like to be here in this locker room together one last time shoulder to shoulder with these men

the game is well under way
its full tilt action
its immediately clear that the tropics are being over powered
quick cuts petrelli knocks over monix and scores
the tropics offense is getting shut down
jackie gets a rebound but then dribbles off his ankle
the fans are disappointed
the guys in the tropical aisle are all bummed out
wheelchair jody looks pissed

theyre already down by ten
on clarence he sits on the spurs bench
coffee black youre going in

monix gets in petrellis face

he stands up and begins walking across the court to join the tropics
where the hell are you going

clarence takes off his spurs jersey and throws it into the crowd
jackie is laid out on a bench
scootsie pours a bucket of water on him

jackie seems very serious
i had a dream
i had a dream i was in heaven and my mother spoke to me
she was wearing a flowing white gown
and she showed me a whole new way to score a basket
she spoke to me and said with this gift you will win fourth place
hes lost his mind
we need to figure out what were going to do in the second half
yeah we dont have time for any ghost baskets
jackies eyes are intense and hes breathing way too hard
this dream was real
monix tries to pacify him
alright jackie relax okay
monix and clarence shoot each other a look
clearly jackie is not going to take no for an answer
okay jackie so whats the play
the second half is underway
clarence and jackie are both playing for the tropics
were back in action here at the mega bowl
coffee black is playing for the tropics
and jackie moon makes the start
in fact it looks like hes trying to run the offense here
jackie dribbles at the top of the key doing a lot of pointing along with multiple hand signals
this is a new offense for the tropics
jackie dribbles to the top of the key
jackie makes eye contact with clarence
clarence cuts to the basket and jackie throws him a lob
slo mo as clarence leaps we hear jackies voice over from the locker room
i had a dream
and in my dream my mother jumped
her gown flowing in the wind
and she caught a pass in the air and dunked it without ever touching the ground
slo mo clarence catches it and slams it hard
she lifted her veil and said i call this the alley oop
everyone stands there astonished
the other team is frozen
the fans are confused
the ref has no idea what to do
and she said it would change the game forever
the other players are starting to appreciate what theyve just seen
im sorry i dont know what just happened
doesnt he have to dribble first
what the hell is going on
hey jackie isnt that against the rules
my mom said it was fine
the whole arena is waiting for father pat the ref to process this information
father pat the ref waves his hands
the ref has stopped the mega bowl
the other players stop jackies attack
monix steps over and calmly states the facts
its not a foul unless you touch another player
and it cant be traveling without first establishing a pivot foot
its two points father pat two points
father pat the ref thinks about this
the crowd goes nuts
the other team protests
jackie points to the sky right through the hole in the roof
clarence slams down another alley oop
wheelchair darren and wheelchair jody go crazy

ill tell you monix is playing on one leg here in the second half
monix cuts off a bee bee ellis pick toward the basket
monix penetrates and wow
he flipped it up behind his back and clarence slammed it home with one hand
scoreboard spurs tropics left
monixs team breaks the huddle and takes the floor
in all my years of radio ive never seen anything like this
the tropics have fought their way back from a twenty nine point deficit

its the final play the fans pray
monix takes a deep breath then in bounds the ball slo mo jackie dribbles looks up and lofts a perfect pass to clarence
slo mo clarence flies up for the alley oop slam dunk
slo mo at the last second petrelli flies into frame and swats it away
petrelli with the rejection

ill tell you lou the spurs were looking for that one
in the huddle monix is yelling above the noise
in the huddle okay listen up theyve made adjustments out there

monix looking to inbound

but this time a bead of sweat rolls over his forehead
he is nervous
but he tosses anyway
slo mo the ball floats toward the basket
flash bulbs pop
slo mo the ball bounces off the rim away from the basket
slo mo monix elbows his way into position for a rebound
