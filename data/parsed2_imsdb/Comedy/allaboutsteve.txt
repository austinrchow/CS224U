crossword constructors usually have above average intelligence with knowledge of just about every subject you can imagine
and it helps if they can spell

she leans in close to the front row scares herself more than anybody

mary fidgets in her seat
in crosswords as in life some days are harder than others
in the new york times for example the puzzles get harder as the week goes
so on monday a day that traditionally bites the big one the crossword is super easy
its comforting to know that although life can be difficult at times crosswords let you off easy when you need it the most
mary looks around for anybody to talk to
the other passengers avert their eyes
mary starts biting her nails
a frail year old man mr
takihashi works alongside his wspapers ish granddaughter betty selling magazines ne smokes and pocky

takihashi like hes deaf
he ignores her
mary hands the papers to betty
betty just rings up the papers
did you see the review of hairspray in the journal yesterday
they used the word spectacular always a good sign
maybe youd like to go see it with rne
i have a coupon for five dollars off
betty shoves the newspapers back across the counter points at them then speaks in barely recognizable english
nine dollar twenty
mary fishes in her bag for money
we could bring your dad if you want
i dont think the show is ageist
that means he wont feel like a loser for being old
as she takes her time paying mr
takihashi madly gestures about mary holding up the line
betty barks at her
betty takes marys money waves her on and helps the next customer
so no then
thats a no
betty ignores her
mary waits loads the newspapers into her bag
sometimes crosswords are even better than life
they dont discriminate
crosswords dont care if youre young or old black or white male female or intersex
crosswords only care if youre an idiot
and really thats okay because if you have the iq of a yam finishing a crossword should be the least of your worries
mary glances up at the tv news once more then walks away
a half dozen news crews rush to load and unload cnn news echs vans
journalists photographers producers soundyt all in a mad rush to go get an unshaven and surprisingly calm steve balances camera equipment in one hand while he scratches a barely legible

hartman grabs a gas mask and rushes to the vans side mirror
i need blush

itll look like i could be the first media victim
hartman hughes no such thing as too close to the story
hartman looks back at steve and angus
theyre just standing there unable to keep a straight face
i knew it was too good to be true
he throws his gas mask down storms off
hartman come on
hartman gets in the elevator hollers out to them
i had a perfectly good bologna sandwich going on upstairs
angus and steve watch the elevator door close shrug it off

she hands him the paper
engrossing one child exclaimed
a ten year old said that

and ebullient what happened to your knee
mary looks down at the blood dripping down from her knee onto her sock
shes completely annoyed more at the question than the mess
dad some of the greatest orators of all time had their heads chopped off for their labors
im lucky to escape with a simple flesh wound
mary hands over the last newspaper heads out to the hallway
her mother yells to her

a brain tumor characterized by among other things dementia
mary walks up the stairs

mary stops on the stairs
silence from her parents
mary marches back into the living room
in fact im normalis extremes
thats the kind of normal that doesnt get more normal

mary looks at her obviously lying mother and uncomfortable father
marys mind reels like her head is going to explode
finally a determination hits her
mary bolts up the stairs to her room
horowitz look at each other surprised happy
you ever want to see grandchildren you better burn the damn boots
she swats him with her book tries not to laugh

we are as yet unknown to one another
its nerve wracking i know
try not to have a spontaneous epileptiform seizure
the doorbell rings
mary freezes listens for the muffled voices downstairs
she sits on the corner of her bed and breathes rapidly into a paper bag
theres a knock on her bedroom door
mary folds up the bag puts it in her pocket for later then opens the door a crack
its her mother

horowitz opens the door wider takes a look at mary looks like shes going to cry
look at you

beautiful and smart
mary takes a deep breath lets it out fast
lets hope all that does it for him
a bored cnn jacket wearing steve looks up to see mrs
horowitz descending the stairs
not far behind mary takes each step like her knees are fused together but still manages to look hot
steves pleasantly surprised
with one look at steve marys eyes glaze over as if a choir is screaming hallelujah in her brain
as mary reaches the bottom step mary hi
she puts up a finger just a second
she turns around and runs back upstairs
steve looks at mrs
and hows your mother
she just stares at him and smiles
mary runs into her room kneels down in front of the mizrach and crucifix on the wall
hands clasped in prayer
you may have noticed that im wearing clean socks
translation im really trying and thus should be amply rewarded
thanks for your support
she gets up has a second thought gets back onto her knees
and by support i dont mean you know she hikes up her bra
i mean your assistance your furtherance your advocacy of my efforts to get out there and
do what im supposed to do
she concentrates hard opens her eyes
now shes ready
steve waits as mary walks down the stairs again this time a bit more relaxed
there we go
mary makes it to the bottom of the stairs steps into her red boots
her mother cringes
steves a bit surprised at the boots but who cares marys still hot from the knee caps up
mary nods a bunch of times
calling into living room sir
you kids have fun
be careful now
dont forget your seatbelts
horowitz sees them out the door then heads into the living room
she waves to them out the window trying to hide her worry but failing miserably
shell be fine
they look at each other a bit of hope a bit of dread
steve unlocks the drivers side door of his suv while mary waits at her door nervous but smiling
sorry about this blind date thing
my mother i never went to kindergarten
he looks at her totally confused
they skipped me to the forth grade
she gets in the car fastens her seatbelt
steve hesitates then heads to the drivers side gets in
i missed finger painting
he has no clue what to say
she lunges for his lips but the seatbelt snaps her back inches short
undeterred by the whiplash mary undoes her seatbelt and tries again this time making contact with steves lips
hes more than a little startled but kisses her back anyway all the while straining to see the horowitz house
uh what about your mother
she straddles him and keeps kissing
youre not her type
and shes married
no were right in front of your house and
she undoes her sweater
and i have no problem with that whatsoever
she kisses his neck
he looks up with a thank you god
is it steven with a v or stephen with a p h
she works over his face over like its an ice cream cone
i thought so
there are almost a million stevens with a v in the country you know
its much more popular than the p h way almost twice as popular in fact
i think its the brits who prefer the p h
they love their p hs over there
not as much as they love their fish and chips but still they love them
it was the media thing you know thats why our moms wanted us to get together
you work in the media so do i
we really have to hand it to our moms steve we do and not just for raising us or for thriving during a time when women painstakingly struggled for equality
but i mean we should hand it to them for being visionaries and predicting our all encompassing compatibility
were professionally compatible yes but its occurring to me at this particular moment that were also sexually compatible and i dont know if you noticed like i noticed but were
also both wearing blue
what are the chances of that
actually if i really think about it the chances are probably pretty good
blue is one of the most popular three colors however yours is she leans forward and checks the fabric tag on the neck of his jacket
she cant quite read it
she reaches up and flips on the interior light
steves just about blinded
she grabs the tag reads
she grabs her own tag and reads it just about elbowing steve in the eye
both synthetic fibres
and the chances of that are much smaller than the chances of us just wearing blue
steve looks at mary suddenly fully aware of her craziness
do you like crosswords
she just about jumps out of her pants with excitement
and semantics the study of the meaning of words
you love words right
whats not to love
she can hardly believe her good fortune
her mind reels just as fast as her lips
steve with a v you know what we are
two of a kind
two rare earth elements brought together by norns thats scandinavian for the destinies
you want to make out for ten to fifteen minutes more then go get a six pack of twinkies and mountain dew and stay up all night and talk
steve is frozen
no escape then it hits him
he jumps a bit pulls out his cell phone
i have to get this
i didnt hear it ring
i didnt feel it you didnt
into phone this is steve
if i dont have a choice
he hangs up looks at mary like he feels bad
i have to go to
this happens all the time
you know how it is
wherever news happens
mary gets off of him slides back into her seat buttons her sweater
when you get back we can have plenty of quality time
ill call you
he leans over opens her door
steve this has been a night to remember
you certainly are he searches for any word that will do
mary jumps in
you read my mind
never happier she jumps out of the car
as he drives away she pulls the paper bag out of her pocket breathes into it
marys parents hear the door open then marys footsteps hit the stairs
horowitz jumps up rushes to meet her
sweetie whats wrong
my god youve barely been gone ten minutes
mary stops on the stairs turns back
mom sometimes thats all you need to know hes the one
mary smiles big takes the rest of the stairs up two at a time
horowitz is about to follow her
that girl makes up her mind the moon is green its green
leave her be
horowitz moves away from the stairs no less worried
mary leaps from the doorway and lands on her bed in pencil pose smiling up at the ceiling
eleven letter word for serendipity
she screams into her pillow
the perfect answer s e r e n d i p i t y
why would you ever need a better word than that
she sits up grabs her notebook starts to draw out a new crossword puzzle
a busy newspaper office
couriers make deliveries journalists talk at their desks secretaries count the minutes until they can go home
in the editors office jim soloman looks over the newspaper layout with an assistant
lets split the gardening feature into two weeks

when i was a fledgling that means novice crossword constructor i would find comfort in the words of the learned crossword sages
above all my hero is manny nosowsky frequent new york times contributor and all around cruciverbial master
mary walks out of the elevator and heads through the office
nobody seems to notice her
manny says that a crossword puzzles greatness can be determined by asking three simple questions
she marches in the direction of the editors office

she arrives at the editors office plants her feet in the doorway

soloman grabs the crossword and hands it right to the assistant who rushes it out the door

soloman shakes his head its done
mary hesitates then finally gets up

he ignores that
she walks out seemingly content a bit of denial
a payroll clerk sees the elevator doors close behind mary

corbitt slows it to normal speed mutes it
they watch as hartman interviews an attractive female botanist holding a test tube with a seedling in it
hartman keeps pointing to the seedling which happens to be right in front of the botanists generous breasts
the camera gets closer and closer each time it pulls away hartman points to the seedling again to force the camera in close basically turning the piece into a giant

she checks the dial tone hangs up quickly continues with the puzzle
four letter word for am i going to wait my whole life for steve to call

she flails out of the tub like a salmon heading upstream grabs a towel barely big enough to cover her
without any effort to dry off she runs out of the bathroom
towel wrapped around her but barely covering mary reaches the top of the stairs
her wet feet sliding all over the place she opts for the safety of a banister slide
she gets up on it slides a few inches before realizing what a bad idea it was
ow ow ouch
she gets off the banister slops the rest of the way down the stairs jumps into the doorway of the living room

the banner on the screen reads workplace killing
wherever news happens dad
wherever news happens
passengers board the bus destined for dallas
way too excited in her red boots mary is the last in line
she hugs her mother then jumps up onto the first step of the bus
horowitz holds marys knapsack and kroger bag shakes his head in disbelief
this is nuts
mary takes the bags from him
abe catherine im off

geographically yes i know
figuratively philosophically spiritually much less so

the world is my ostrea edulis
that means the edible kind of oyster

she tries to switch her leather bag for marys kroger bag
mary resists points back and forth between the two bags
mom two handles two handles they both hold stuff whats the difference
horowitz goes to explain gives up
that steve shows any disrespect youre on the next bus back here
do you mean unmannerly tactless vulgar
because hes a straight man dad and some things cant be helped
but if you mean inconsiderate to me contemptuous toward me insulting irreverent uncivil lets go already
she steps up one more step yells out to her parents and the i dont know when ill be back but i do know this the door shuts in her
mary waves to her worried parents through the closed door
to herself im not coming back alone
local and national news crews are camped across the road from the medieval times castle
among them steve holds the cnn camera on hartman
a young audio tech josh hovers nearby
paula what started out as a routine rehearsal here at the dallas medieval times turned deadly when an employee allegedly turned on his fellow performers
twenty four hours later at least thirty employees are still being held hostage by the assailant their lives hanging in the balance
he listens to his earpiece nods
the castle you see behind me is one of eight medieval times dinner theatre restaurants
guests who cross the drawbridge enjoy a medieval style feast while watching the main attraction knights engaging in a battle of strength and skill
the restaurant promises fun feasting and fighting but it appears that this time fun was in short supply
a few feet away angus frantically takes notes as he talks to a maintenance worker then slips a piece of paper to hartman
paula devastating news just in
we have one confirmed death an andalusian a purebred spanish horse
one of many that perform in the show and the first innocent victim of a rogue knights rage
he takes a moment to fake compose himself barely getting the words out
at times like this i like to think theres a heaven just for horses
a rolling meadow lush grasses unlimited supply of
those things horses like to lick or is that cows
nevertheless a beautiful peaceful place
he turns and looks toward to the medieval times
may you long roam in that heaven noble horse angus hands him another note
hartman scans it instantly kills the fake anguish
but not quite yet
were the first to report the horse is not dead paula
the horse is alive and well after having merely fainted as it was trained to do for the show
one happy blessed miracle
hartman contd while a deranged madman continues to hold the lives of his coworkers in his depraved hands
and theyre out
a pissed off hartman pulls out his earpiece
get it a bit closer to right before you hand it to me
josh moves in removes hartmans mic
but then we wouldnt have heard about horse heaven
josh and angus laugh
its that kind of genius that won me the southeast idaho christian family coalitions journalist of the year award you ingrates
the bus is full
most passengers sleep
mary sits in the aisle seat of the first row a burly man in his s beside her
the light above their seats illuminates the crossword puzzle hes working on
mary looks over his shoulder points to the blank spaces in his puzzle
the man drops the crossword glares at her
she looks away starts biting her nails then spots a sign on the freeway calls out to the driver and anybody else who will listen
named after sir henry bessemer a brit
guess what he did
perfected the way steel is made of course
mary contd i wont bore you with the whole story just the best parts like how it involves molten pig iron which does not as one might think have anything
to do with pigs
its actually a raw iron made from iron ore plus limestone plus coke and by coke i mean the carbonaceous residue not the cola or the booger sugar
mary looks around for a response nothing
you know what else is in bessemer
the city i mean
its crazy i know
that guy was such an asshole
the drivers eyes glaze over
please let this and
the bus pulls into the rundown rest stop
the driver looks at the passengers
most of them are still sleeping
well just take five minutes here
he steps off the bus
mary turns to the man next to her
can you watch my stuff
he glares at her you have got to be kidding
mary grabs her backpack and kroger bag and steps off the bus
mary walks into the restaurant heads toward the ladies room
on her way she spots a television behind the counter
a few diners watch
mary joins them
on the tv medieval times hostage crisis
on tv perhaps the greatest obstacle the hostage negotiators face is the suspects refusal to communicate using modern day technology
in keeping with his role as a medieval knight hes insisting on an eleventh century messenger to deliver all communication
the screen splits with a female news anchor
what are we talking about here hartman
a few of the diners overhear
actually homing pigeons
the diners look at mary
carrier pigeons despite their name are more or less useless when it comes to actually carrying anything
homing pigeons are better for messenger work
the diners lose interest
mary catches the eye of a wanderer at the end of the counter
hes hanging on her every word
you know who used them all the time
loved the pigeons scared to death of pooches though
the wanderer just stares at her
you know dogs canines de honden
she looks back at the tv
have the negotiators located any homing pigeons
where do you even get them in this day and age
you can buy them on the internet for twenty five bucks a pop
mary looks at the diners smiles points to the tv
my boyfriend is probably holding that camera right now
the diners ignore her and just eat their pie
mary realizes the time runs out of the rest stop
mary runs out into the parking lot
the bus is gone
crap crap crap
she looks down the road no sign of the bus anywhere
she takes her paper bag out of her pocket breathes into it
a truck driver passes her with coffee in hand on his way to his rig
do you know when the next bus to dallas goes through here
cant say i do
i missed mine
she breathes double time into the paper bag
he takes pity on her
im headed that way
he points to his truck
mary looks at the truck looks at him looks at the truck thinks about it for a long time
with no sign of an answer forthcoming the truck driver keeps walking to his rig
when hes just about there mary yells out to him
you ever killed animals
he looks at her surprised but amused
set a garbage can full of kittens on fire or anything like that
now hes disturbed
would i tell you if i did
mary thinks some more
wait for the next bus if that suits you
he climbs into the truck
mary runs to catch up with him
do you have a
matches zippo blow torch et al
may i see your license
he pulls his license out of the visor flashes it
mary steps up and grabs it looks at it closely
norman james durwood
she reaches up and shakes his hand
mary magdalene horowitz
good to meet you
still holding the license she digs in her kroger bag pulls out a large black magic marker
she pushes up her sleeve and writes norms license number in huge print down her arm
norm if youre going to rape and murder me youll have to cut me up into a million chunks and scatter me all over four states otherwise this appendage she
holds her arm up shows him
will lead homicide detectives right to you
she smiles at him warmly puts the marker back in her bag
and you already told me you dont have a light to burn the flesh off
norm cant believe this
before he can say a word mary moves around to the passenger side hops up into the truck
she notices some snacks on the dash
want to go halfsies
at a loss norm motions for mary to help herself
as she unwraps a pie he reluctantly starts up the truck
steve reloads his battery camera at the rental van
angus looks over paperwork
rebecca wants you to come for dinner when were back home
her cousin from florida
its a set up
i dont care
my mom set me up with this chick you let you mother set you up
what the hell is wrong with you
theres a commotion in the distance
every photographer on the grounds focuses on the castle
reporters jump into position
hartman touches up his make up roots through his bag
he yells out to steve angus and josh
which one of you bastards hid my bronzing shimmer
the police surrounding the castle take aim
dead silence as the medieval times drawbridge lowers
a knight walks out arms raised as high as his squeaking armor will allow which is not very high but high enough to get the point across surrender
norm drives as mary drones on while flipping through a truck repair manual
and my other rule about crossword puzzles is this
doing a crossword with a pencil is like screaming with your lips duct taped together
mary contd if youre going to do a crossword you should do it fearlessly with abandon and with a pen
i prefer a medium tip felt blue quiet time might be good right about now
she thinks about it whispers
do you mean quiet as in softly hushed like this
or do you mean quiet as in silent
mary squeezes her lips together holds them
it lasts for about a second
thanks for not raping me
as the sun comes up norms truck drives into dallas
norms truck drives away leaving mary standing on the side of interstate
she looks across the road to the medieval times its completely deserted
eight letter word for screwed
mary crosses to the medieval times parking lot steps over the police line blowing in the wind
f a s t e n e d
she looks around
theres nobody for miles
thats whats great about crosswords and life
every once in a while you get a surprise
she heads back to the interstate starts walking
mary walks past tv in the bus station tuned to fox news
on every screen images of an upset woman dodging press to get through the doors of childrens hospital oklahoma city
the screen caption the fight for baby peggy
mary talks on a pay phone
all roads lead to oklahoma papa
marys parents share the phone
last time i checked freeway still heads right back here
mary continues on the phone
my road dad
you dont commit to a relationship and then give up because youd rather be at home curled up in front of the fireplace with a thesaurus
this is what people are supposed to do go out on a limb for love
my limb just happens to be in oklahoma
its only miles away from home
no big deal
mary contd just think of this like the time i went to girl scout camp except for the part where i got kicked out
this time no unsupervised butane experiment is going to ruin the adventure i swear
horowitz hangs up the phone
horowitz walks to the tv turns it on flips stations
images of the oklahoma hospital vigil are everywhere
captions like breaking news baby peggy flash across the screen
dozens of local and national news vans line the streets surrounding the hospital
a long line of news crews views of the hospitals admitting entrance behind them
at one end of the line a male koco oklahoma reporter talks to camera
eleven months ago the child weve come to know as baby peggy was born with an extremely rare birth defect a third leg
shortly after the birth her parents misty and bill dunlevy separated
now with joint custody one parent wants the baby to keep the third leg the other wants it gone
a few feet away a female fox news reporter is on camera
after months of legal wrangling a judge has ordered in favor of the mother
amputation surgery is scheduled for wednesday but the father bill dunlevy isnt about to give up
as his lawyers work to secure an injunction the devoted father rallies public support for the extra limb
at the end of the long line of news crews steve has the camera on hartman
god wouldnt have given my child the third leg if he didnt want her to keep it
but for now the fate of that precious childs third leg is the hands of a judge
this is hartman hughes reporting live from oklahoma city
steve signals theyve cut lowers his camera
hartman calls out to angus
what if next time i say baby peggy is like the wishbone of her parents dispute
hartman acts out a wishbone pull
yeah go ahead and suggest that
corbitt will love it
steve turns and looks toward the edge of the fenced off hospital grounds
dozens of protestors are camped out a sorry assortment of oddballs standing at the fence waving their signs spare the leg and honor the father
many of them carry drawings of a three legged baby wearing a halo
steve braces himself and heads for the crowd
half way across he spots a loner walking from the parking lot
hes chubby his shirt buttoned one button off so it hangs lower on the left
this is howard
in one hand a pro leg sign
in his other hand a carton of chocolate milk
howard stops to lick up the chocolate milk spilling all over his arm
steve catches up with him
mind if i ask you a few questions on camera
how do you feel about whats going on here
steve shoulders his camera focuses in on howards sign
its an impressively detailed drawing of a judge yanking a babys third leg off
i havent made up my mind yet
both parties have valid arguments
hospital staff protestors and the curious public approach the hospital grounds
a taxi inches through the crowd
it barely stops when mary leaps out like shes late for a yanni concert
mary steps onto the hospital grounds and looks all around her news crews circulate patients and staff walk in and out of the hospital protestors line the fence
somewhere in the middle she finds what shes hunting for steve
marys face lights up and she starts running toward him in her mind no doubt in slow motion with clouds parting to light her way
steves attention is drawn away from the interview with howard
he spots mary running toward him arms outstretched
please god no
he looks for a place to hide but shes running ridiculously fast
its too late
shes only a few feet away
she jumps into his arms but hes only got one arm free and isnt about to use it to catch her
she slides down his leg to the ground but quickly picks herself up
astounded flabbergasted bushwacked he pulls mary off to the side away from everybody
what are you doing
talking to you
and noticing how the oklahoma climate agrees with your complexion
tell me you didnt come all the way here just to see me
of course not
i went to dallas looking for you first
and you know why
steve grabs his head
this is not happening
because youre inimitable and im intransigent
no were not
i dont know what that means but trust me
were so not
it means youre awesome and im unstoppable
listen mary you seem like a nice girl and the ten minutes we spent together were mind blowing
at a complete loss he just goes along
sure but im working here
mary points to the partially hidden side door of the hospital
a man with his face covered in a nurses uniform and dress shoes sneaks out the door unnoticed
im just here to support you show you i care and also ask why you arent following that guy pretending to be a nurse but obviously not wearing sterilizable non
steve looks toward the hospital spots the man
if i was baby peggys dad thats how id avoid the press too
steve takes off running
mary yells out to him
ill be right here in case you want to make out later on
steve looks back a bunch of people stare
mary waves to him then watches until hes out of sight
a security guard approaches her
miss if you want to be here youre going to have to stay behind the fence
mary turns to see what hes pointing at the growing crowd of protestors off in the distance
they wave their signs around cry sing and sway together their painful song barely audible from afar
near far wherever you are we believe that the leg should stay on
mary watches paralyzed with awe like seeing herself in the mirror for the first time ever
at last she has found her people
an overweight ish woman elizabeth who shouldnt be wearing those low rise pants and cropped tee lights a bunch of candles in the grass behind the protestor fence
she reaches the last candle in line just as mary walks up to join the group
elizabeth looks up at mary smiles
i like your boots
i found them in an alley
elizabeth looks at the boots again impressed
she stands up
are you pro leg or anti leg
this is the pro leg group over here
were supporting baby peggys dad in his fight to save the babys third leg
she points to the end of the fenced off area where only a few protestors hold anti leg signs normal life for baby peggy those are the anti leggers
theyre all for the amputation
im just here because my boyfriend is working the story
hes with cnn the worlds news leader the most trusted name in news the place where more the pro leggers have better snacks
im definitely pro leg
elizabeth smiles hands mary a candle
horowitz watch tv and read at the same time
the tv is on mute cnns baby peggy coverage
in the corner of the screen amputation countdown hours
shots of the protestors candlelight vigil appear on the screen
horowitz spots mary in the crowd standing next to elizabeth
she sings and waves her candle around all the while straining to look for steve
there she is
there she is right there
horowitz glances up from his book
shes going to set her hair on fire with that candle
look shes made friends
horowitz tries not to cry
at the back doors of the rental van steve and angus work on laptops
steve confides in angus trying not to wake up hartman sleeping on the back seat
shes on me what thirty seconds after meeting me and the chick will not shut up the whole time
i had to fake a work call gave her the imitating steve wherever news goes
i think im in the clear then she does this crossword she works for the citizen she does this crossword all about me and as if thats not crazy enough
she shows up here
over by the fence
cant miss her
is she hot
when a psychotic chicks swinging a machete at your throat who cares if shes hot
ive been married to the same woman for seventeen years
the chick is cra zy
hartman sits up totally awake and never happier
he points at steve
this is priceless
a short ish protestor and his protestor wife talk to an oklahoma journal record newspaper reporter at the fence
all were saying is wait until baby peggy can talk and ask her what she wants to do with the spare
mary listens in while she dispenses a hot chocolate from another protestors backpack thermos
she finishes pouring taps the guy on the shoulder
he walks away
mary takes a sip of the hot chocolate burns her mouth
she grabs her tongue with her fingers
hartman appears right in front of her
shes a bit stunned and star struck
he offers his hand
mary lets go of her tongue uses her saliva covered hand to shake his
mary mary mary
he takes his hand back discretely wipes it on his pants
steve told me you were beautiful
he was going on and on and on and on about it
i had to come see for myself
thank y he puts an arm around her pulls her away from the crowd
listen mary ive been working with steve for about a year now
the guy is like a brother to me
a young protestor recognizes hartman
without missing a step hartman grabs a pen from his pocket and autographs the guys sign whether he wants it or not then continues on with mary
girls follow us around everywhere we go
who do you think theyre after
hartman reflects on it smiles
me of course me but every once in a while some of them try to land steve
sure hell go for a few skanks here and there but its all just a sad attempt to hide his fear
all he wants is to love but hes afraid of opening up afraid of putting himself out there afraid of somebody like you mary yes you afraid of you breaking
can you blame him
shes a bit stunned and confused by all of this
promise me this
promise youll stick around long enough to help him get over that fear
he tells you to go away dont
he says he thinks youre crazy
hes crazy mary
crazy not to let down his walls and tell you how he really feels
can i count on you to hang in there no matter what
i dont want to interfere in his work but i just need to be here for him and he grabs her hugs her in so her words are all muffled
and yet she keeps talking
the security guard walks past gestures that they should be behind the fence
hartman holds up his press pass to get rid of the guard then lets go of mary
he points her toward the protestors starts backing away
ill tell steve to come find you when we wrap for the day
what side are you on
she shows him her button featuring a cartoon of a very happy three legged baby
you might want to jump camps
no way theyre going let that baby keep the third leg and live like a freak
he waves and turns around starts heading for the press camp
mary calls out to him
shed just be like the tree frogs
hartman turns around
a trematode parasite causes polymely that means extra limbs in tree frogs
it happens all the time
in some ponds theres like a quarter of the tree frogs with extra legs
hartman looks at her like shes a nutcase
angus is on his phone as steve rushes to set up his equipment
hartman arrives back at the van
whats going on
josh rushes to get the mic on hartman
the parents of the kid got back together
tell me you werent talking to mary
go to hell hughes
scans it angus hands hartman the press release
the kid keeps the leg
hartman checks his teeth in a hand mirror
til she gets it caught in a car door
news spreads around the pro leg protestors camp
they all start hollering with joy
the disappointed anti leg protestors ditch their signs and storm off
horowitz is asleep in front of the tv
he wakes up as the amputation countdown clock on the news stops
the news crews line the hospital entrance once again
with mere hours to spare the dunlevys reconciled agreeing to halt surgery until baby peggy is old enough to decide for herself
further down the row of reporters and while dozens of children fight for their lives behind these walls baby peggy wont be one of them
with surgery cancelled its time for the dunlevys to be a family once again
past a few more news crews at the end the line steve has the camera on hartman
and like the noble tree frog whose extra leg is nothing if not natural so baby peggy begins the rest of her three legged life
this is hartman hughes reporting live from oklahoma city
hartman pulls out his ear piece
angus josh and steve all look at him a bit surprised
where do you get this shit
hartman taps the side of his head its all up here
a little thing called astutitude my friends
steve and angus look at each other is that even a word
mary celebrates with the other protestors
the protestor and his protestor wife cry tears of joy
mary pulls a tissue out of her bag hands it over
the husband takes it turns away and wipes his eyes

nothing to be ashamed of
elizabeth runs up to mary hugs her
when you sing loud enough and when your signs are big enough people listen
mary spots some of the news vans pulling away

mary drops her bags runs toward the media camp
josh pulls the back doors of the van shut
angus at the wheel hartman in the passenger seat
in the back steve nervously looks out the windows
josh gets in next to him
angus starts driving slowly across the grass behind other news vans
steve finally relaxes
as the van drives mary runs to catch up
hartman spots mary in the rear view mirror
angus hold up
steve sees what hartmans looking at
hartman rolls down his window
hartman sticks his head out the window

hartman waves to mary to catch up
angus sees her in the mirror as he drives

steve hides behind the seat just as mary catches up with the van
mary tries to get a look at steve but can only see part of his back hunched over behind the seat

angus leans over to her window
i dont think weve met
mary shakes angus hand
he cant take his eyes off her
steves not feeling well
im sure hell be fine by the time we get to new mexico
your eyes are striking
steve punches him through the seat
steve really wants you to follow us
it would mean a lot to him
steve cringes goes to speak up but stops himself and hidden
he was going to go ask you himself but look at the poor bastard
so sick he cant even sit up straight
what if its a viral zoonotic disease
he should see a doctor
exactly what i told him but the only person he wants touching his infected flesh is you
mary looks at steve worried

hartman grabs her face squishes her lips to shut her hey now we need you to be strong for him

mary nods unable to speak

he lets go of her face

she backs away from the window
angus waves to her and starts driving
nothing wrong with that one
except for those boots
youre an asshole hughes
mary watches the van drive away
only a few protestors remain
abandoned signs and garbage cover the grass
elizabeth gets autographs from other protestors like its the last day of high school
mary runs up grabs her bags
i have to meet steve at his next job in new mexico
hes sick not as in rad although he is that too but more like unwell infirm perhaps barfy
hopefully nothing serious but you never can be too sure and besides healthy or not he needs me
sign my book before you go
elizabeth hands her the ratty hand decorated book and a pen
the trips not too long right through all kinds of interesting sites like for example el santuario de chimayo the lourdes of america
know what that is
a sacred sand pit near a burrito stand
what could be better than that
mary looks away from elizabeth fidgets a bit

unless youre busy i mean
you probably have something better to do
elizabeth thinks about it
mary is stunned
she takes a minute to realize its real gets excited
from behind her ill go too
mary turns around and spots howard
mary have you met howard
mary shakes her head
howard offers his hand
its got dried chocolate milk all over it
she takes it
mary howards got a car you know

mary looks at him thinks about it
what kind of car do you have
mary quickly scans her memory
replace the recalled seat belts
mary thinks about it smiles
lets grab souvenirs
elizabeth and howard each pick up a baby peggy sign off the ground
mary grabs as many as she can hold way way too many
a bunch of them slide off but she perseveres
heres something you never see in crosswords two letter words and thank goodness for that
the word go not fun
the word vamoose super fun
crosswords are just like life in that way theyre only boring if you have no sense of adventure
howard starts the car
in the passenger seat elizabeth has a bunch of the protest signs crammed in at her feet
mary gets settled in the back seat spots a copy of scientific american magazine then finds an apple stuck behind the seat belt
she yanks the apple out looks at it
howard looks at her in the rear view mirror
you can have that

mary puts the apple in her kroger bag
howard if you get sleepy and want to trade off driving for a while just wake me up and ill take over
mary contd im a night owl yes but im also a day owl too a burrowing owl technically
they stay awake all day too
im pretty much alert always have been
just sugar and my natural tendency to you know never fall asleep
mary leans back closes her eyes and shes out
howards car merges onto the highway westbound toward new mexico and into the night
mary sleep talks in the back
aka the mabolo the date plum the velvet apple
a media extravaganza local national and this time international news teams
a reporter for inside edition talks on camera
this tragedy began eight months ago in what was once paradise the elysium sanctuary outside of taos new mexico
for years celebrities considered the five star meditation resort the only true place for spiritual purification and with good reason
nestled in the heart of reclaimed pueblo indian lands the elysium sanctuary promised one thing enlightenment
a court tv reporter is on camera a few feet away
but the elysium sanctuary would never be the same after tragedy struck last winter
twenty six year old resort masseuse juan carlos velasquez found stabbed to death in the meditation villa of beloved star of stage and screen cloris leachman
a bit further down theline of reporters an extra
reporter is on camera
publicists for the eighty year old leachman insist her relationship with the deceased velasquez was no different than with the dozens of other resort personnel attending to ms
leachman during her solitude retreat
at the end of the row hartman reports
but the octogenarian leachman may not have been as innocent as her representatives claimed at least according to the evidence found at the murder scene
hartman reads from his notes
whips hot wax bamboo skewers a spanking bench and perhaps most damaging a henna tattoo across ms
leachmans chest that read mrs
juan carlos velasquez
elizabeth mary and howard step onto the curb and survey the crowd
on one side an odd assortment of fans with signs like free cloris jail real criminals not old ladies and oscar winners dont kill with photos of cloris leachman through
on the other side of the crowd a smaller group of mexican mourners with signs justice for juan guilty and let guilty or not
they all think about it
a greasy haired shaman clyde steps up behind them
everybody deserves the benefit of the doubt
he looks at mary smiles
as he joins the leachman fans mary thinks about it
be has a point
i love cloris leachman
i have to go find steve
how do i look
unwashed hair bed head and theres a chunk of a twinkie caked onto marys ear
elizabeth picks the twinkie off smooths down marys hair
ill be back
save me a sign
and if cloris comes out tell her i loved her in my little pony the movie
mary runs off as howard and elizabeth join the crowd of fans
mary walks among the news vans
at the entrance to a nearby tent hartman spots her waves her over
whatd you do to your hair
slept on it in the car
is he okay
come in and wait
hell be back soon
a briefing area is set up folding chairs table podium
a bunch of male journalists sit around the table playing poker vince cnn doug cnn the court tv reporter a bbc news photographer a french photographer a spanish journalist and
hartman escorts mary in
the guys perk up a bit
you all know mary
mary shakes hands around the table greets them all in their native tongues
she gets to angus
he kisses her hand
my dear sit
he shoves the bbc guy out of the way to make room for mary next to him
vince shuffles the cards
mary you in
technically im familiar but ive never actually played
with people i mean
doug throws in some cash as vince starts to deal
howard wanders through the crowd wearing an i v cloris t shirt over his own
he passes a vendor selling innocence beads acquittal incense and autographed cloris leachman photos
the crowd continues to grow
a candles are lit healing rituals performed donuts passed around
mary holds her cards close to her
there are few things that are so unpardonably neglected in our country as poker
guess who said that one
she looks around the table
the guys except angus are starting to lose their patience
and you know what else darling you in or not
mary looks at her cards thinks about it for way too long then grabs a handful of coins from her kroger bag slaps them on the table
send it ladies
steve steps into the tent spots mary turns to run back out
dont go steve
look whos here
mary jumps up just about knocks the table over then sustains a number of injuries trying to leap over chairs
at last she makes it to steve hugs him
thank god youre okay
he looks over her shoulder and mouths youre dead to hartman
he holds her back at arms length looks at her goes speak then stops himself pulls her outside the tent
steve tries to stay calm talking to mary
you have to stop stalking me
its more like picking travel destinations based on where you happen to be working
hartman told me you wanted me here
now that i am what better opportunity for us to get to know each other better
this is crazy
hartman said youd say that
go home mary
and he said youd say that too
its just your fear talking
steve just about loses it
hes not my friend hes not your friend
hes just an asshole who thinks its fun to string you along and make my life hell
he yells toward the tent
get out here
mary looks right at him
you know how sometimes you see a pinguid that means fat and greasy guy with an attractive girl and you think how the heck did he pull that off
people wont think that when they look at us
were perfectly matched
she can hardly contain her excitement
hartman peeks out of the tent
for the hundredth time steve no i am not interested in a threesome with you and your new girlfriend
steve points to mary
tell her the truth
about all the crap you told her
hartman goes to mary grabs her hand
everything i said about steve about his feelings for you his hopes his dreams his fears his unexplainable odor forget about it
forget everything i said
none of it was true
marys stunned devastated
she looks like shes going to cry
hartman and steve look at each other what now
hartman shoves him forward
steve reluctantly puts a comforting hand on her shoulder
because nothing i said comes close to the enormity of steves real feelings for you
mary perks up
steve yanks his hand off her shoulder like its on fire
its a love that defies words
steve jumps him
hartman fights back
stop it you guys
victory attained by violence is tantamount to a defeat for it is momentary
you know who said that
the fight continues
mary half covers her eyes
at the poker table the guys hear scuffling outside
they all jump up and run out of the tent
steve gets a few jabs to hartman as the rest of the guys calmly watch
somebodys going to be crying in a minute
angus hugs mary to console her
hartman gets steve in a headlock
mary cant even watch
im going to go with hughes on this one
come on the guy wears makeup
the guys all start pulling out cash to place bets
mary spots the cash changing hands
this isnt about money
its about courage love honor and all things virtuous and pure
steve kick him in the leberknoedel
hartman looks up at her hurt
the distraction costs him
steve knees him then follows with a jab to his face
hartman drops to his knees tries to pull himself together
hartman wipes his lip looks up at mary
mary millions of people believe what i tell them every night
why shouldnt you
steve dives at him
hartman swings and gets him right in the nose
one of their cell phones ring then another then all the guys phones go off
they all rush off to the court house leaving a stunned mary standing alone
he fought for me
happiest moment of her life
the crowd cheers as cloris leachman is whisked out of the court house and into a police car
she waves to her fans as she goes
the court tv reporter is on camera
the end to a difficult and often emotional trial the verdict finally in cloris leachman found not guilty of the murder of her twenty six year old lover juan carlos
down the row of journalists the bbc crew
after a devastating eight months leachman at last vindicated despite overwhelming evidence against her
six more cameras down the french reporter
eyewitness testimony fingerprints on every inch of the body the murder weapon still warm in her chanel handbag and finally at the end of the line hartman his hair a
mess his lip cut his mood sour
a few feet away filming steves nose bleeds down his chin and shirt
and as she left the court room today a free woman the cheers of her devoted fans carrying her forward the camera is knocked out of position as mary rushes
angus steps in and pulls her away
a cop grabs her
mary looks back to steve as shes dragged back to the fan area
somebody help him
apply a vasoconstrictor a nasal tampon anything
at the absolute least direct pressure and a clean tissue
steve puts the camera back in place
hartman recovers fast
as you can see cloris leachmans fans have become surprisingly violent despite her victory here today
add this to the list of the most dangerous locations for journalists
iraq somalia lebanon sri lanka
and just about any place cloris leachman fans gather
hartman wipes blood from his lip
hartman hughes putting his life at risk to report live from santa fe new mexico
hartman grabs a hand mirror points to his face yells out to steve
this is my gift understand my instrument
makes no difference if youre walking around looking like quasimodo
ignoring hartman steve walks over to angus
how long do you figure until steves phone rings
he cringes answers it
a furious corbitt holds the phone and replays the live shot of hartman at the court house
who the hell was that
steve hesitates on the phone
shes been following me
shes not my girlfriend
he listens clenches his teeth hands the phone to angus
as angus listens steve grabs his equipment waits in dread
angus hangs up the phone hands it back to steve
consider yourself temporarily saved by the storm
its worse than they thought
weve got to move
steve grabs his equipment
they start walking
hell probably fire you after
any luck the storm will kill me first
elizabeth runs around hugging other fans as mary stands at the fence watching the press wrap up worried
clyde the shaman joins her at the fence looks right at her raises a finger to his lips
i didnt shhhh
he puts his hands on the sides of her head
marys confused and a bit freaked out
always thinking thinking thinking
mary goes to speak stops herself
clyde keeps his hands still on her head looks into her eyes
you already found what youre looking for
marys eyes soften and shes suddenly calm
a moment of peace
suddenly mary spots hartman steve and angus rush past
she breaks away from clyde rushes along the fence to catch up
hartman spots her
sorry darling were on to the next story
she runs to the end of the fence jumps it runs after them
mary runs to catch up with steve angus and hartman as they rush to the trucks
angus and hartman load up the truck as steve turns back to mary seething
considering you probably just cost me my job maybe you dont want to talk to me right now
but i do
if youre in trouble because of me i can fix it i can explain to your boss
he or she probably just doesnt understand our relationship
we dont have a relationship
sure we do its just in the pupa stage right now
mary go home
she looks at him hurt
he jumps in the cnn truck as angus starts it up
mary looks around helpless
mary runs to the street behind the cnn truck stops on the sidewalk
behind her a run down rep theater all above eve on the marquee
as she watches the truck drive away her panic suddenly turns to resolve
six letter word for over my lifeless rigormortic and maggot infested i
dead body am i giving up now
d o g g motherfucking e d
she gets out her chapstick liberally applies it dabs a bit on her temples as well
normally i dont condone swearing
i think its something people do when they dont have the vocabulary to express themselves properly but even i with my plenitudinous vocab must admit every once in a while
its okay to get a bit peppery mary talks on a pay phone
no pacing no fidgeting
she means business
i got him in trouble dad
i have to go find him and make it right
theres three places they could be headed
she pulls a note pad out of her pocket looks it over
for each story ive worked out an equation of potential human casualties estimated property damage availability of endlessly repeatable images with bonus points for anything involving reporters in galoshes
theres no doubt in my mind
theyre heading to the storm in galveston
horowitz talks on the living room phone his wife on the hallway phone they look at each other in exasperation
enough is enough
youve got to get home turn in your crossword for next week i cant think of work at a time like this
you cant chase that boy any more
if he doesnt appreciate you its ridiculous to mary screams into the phone
how many times did you propose to dad
horowitz think about it for a second
mary yells on the phone
passengers start to stare
i rest my case
if you gave up the first time dad said no then i wouldnt exist
telling me to give up so soon on my potential husband to be birth father of my twelve future children and adoptive father of my gerbil carol you might as
well be saying that you wish you had given up too and that you never married dad and that id never been born
is that what youre saying
horowitz looks at her husband

the cnn meteorologist points at the map images swirling around the gulf coast
hurricane lorraine currently rated category four expected to hit landfall by tomorrow evening
making the situation even more frightening that area of texas currently in the midst of its worst tornado season in history
tornado images appear on the map
and heres where it gets interesting
a black swarm graphic appears as well

torrential rain pelts the line of vehicles heading north
the only movement in the southbound lanes howards car
in full rain gear hartman walks past rows of boarded up businesses
steve follows him with the camera
angus doug and josh are close behind
the rain is deafening the wind ridiculous
its all hartman can do to stay on his feet
yelling his head off and this time the warnings were hard to ignore
one galvestonian told us tornados we can handle
hurricanes we can handle
bugs we can handle
put em all together and thats a storm i dont need to see
a wise man indeed
something off to the side catches hartmans eye its a picnic table blowing down the street
steve gets the shot then pretends to make adjustments to his camera while he discretely scans the area on the lookout for mary
howard and mary can barely see out the window
the car inches along
mary digs in a kfc bag takes out a handy wipe starts cleaning her body with it
and when i met steve i knew right away we had a lot in common
were both in the media we both love crosswords we both love words
we both felt this unexplainable connection no matter how much his instinct might be to fight it
we just have to get to know each other better thats all
she uses the wipe on her face gets a bit on her lip and the taste is awful
she rolls down the window closes her eyes and gently sticks her face out to rinse with rain water
the car hits a flooded patch of the road
a wave of mud washes up and smacks mary right in the face
she starts the handy wipe bath all over again
a nervous howard speaks up
i saw steve talking to you
he wasnt very nice
mary makes herself busy putting the handy wipe in her kroger bag then looks out the window
if theres one thing i learned from crossword puzzles its that you cant give up
mary contd sometimes you run into a doozy and you think youll never be able to solve it in a million years
if you quit youre right but if you stick with it youll figure it out
she looks at howard
i have to give it one more try
i have to fix the mess i made with his work then maybe he and i for the first time she doesnt seem so sure
you know what my favorite part of doing crosswords is
when you know something you didnt think you knew
mary thinks about it then turns back to looking out the window
hartman stands in the middle of a pier that looks moments away from being carried out to sea
steve shoots from a spot on the pier a few feet closer to shore but not much safer
paula this pier was closed to the public twenty four hours ago and for good reason
steve inches a bit closer for the shot his footing unstable
josh moves in and hangs on to steve to keep him steady
as i stand here i can actually feel the structure moving under my feet
the only thing between me and the limitless depths of the sea is this two by four railing that the railing flies off
hartman drops to his knees and crawls to the other railing then hangs on for dear life
steve and josh struggle to hang on to the camera and each other
steve signals to hartman to wrap it up fast
hartman talks slower than ever
and paula i have to tell you not only has my hearing been permanently damaged by the sheer force of the rain hitting my eardrums but at this point im
beginning to wonder if ill even make it out alive
he raises his head up for the big finish gets hammered by the wind and rain
this is hartman hughes reporting live from galveston texas
steve and josh start backing up off the pier with hartman crawling behind them
steve yells back to him
you had to get the pier shot
just about got us all killed
hartman points in the water yells
steve jumps looks to where hartman is pointing its a plastic bag floating by in the water
youre such an asshole
steve walks off the pier mad as hell
come on that was funny
you have to admit
the northbound lanes now empty howards car is the only one on the road
howard stares out the window the first look of real fear on his face
he hits the brakes starts backing up as quickly as possible
mary looks ahead sees what looks like a tornado up ahead
oh my god
howard backs under an overpass points to a protected area up the cement embankment
mary and howard run up the cement embankment as the rain and winds swirl all around them
well just have to wait for this to pass then well keep going
itll be okay
they look down to the road just in time to see howards car picked up and blown right through the underpass landing on its side in a ditch fifty yards
horowitz watch images of the storm on tv the captions read breaking news killer storm
horowitz crosses herself
horowitz puts an arm around her
this is all your fault
steve is asleep sitting upright in the back of the rental van
a hand caresses his cheek
steve awakens in panic
steve looks at the person in front of him its a scared year old mexican boy
who the hell are you

they pay me twenty dollar to wake you
steve looks outside the van sees doug and hartman laughing hard
the kid scurries out of the van
angus gets in opens up his laptop

shes too smart to come here during this
steve looks around like hes crazy
no shes here somewhere
i can feel it
as the storm calms around them howard and an exhausted mary crouch in the sheltered area
they use a little flashlight on marys keychain to watch debris blowing by
i spy with my little eye a chemical element from group two of the periodic table
howard points to a discarded fireworks casing at their feet
i spy with my little eye
a transition metal she barely has the energy to get the word out
mary points to a steel belted tire on the ground lays back and shuts her eyes
howard takes something out of his its a pocket puts it in her hand
mary looks at it shrivelled sculpted apple head
she smiles hardly able to keep her eyes open
my best seller

shes quiet for once
howard watches her drift off
i went to school for physics but got bored
now i just make these and sell them on appleheadsrule
i was going to give that one to my girlfriend in bangor but i can make her another one

downed trees flooded lawns debris all over the place but all in all not too bad
the storm subsided nothing but a light rain

steve drives hartman is next to him
angus is in the back with doug and josh
tornadocane my ass

they spot mary and howard up ahead in the ditch next to the car on its side
look its your girlfriend

hartman grabs a piece of paper writes fast
we cant just leave them
highway patrols down here every hour
its not like theyll rot in the ditch
as they get closer hartman rolls down his window folds up the piece of paper
what the hell are you doing
getting some fresh air
it helps my pores
steve tries to grab the paper
youre not telling her where were going
hartman leans out the window with the paper waves it around
steve reaches for it one hand on the wheel
as he grabs hartman the truck starts swerving
christ you two
youll get us killed
angus leans into the front seat tries to steady the steering wheel
mary spots the rental van approaching swerving hartman waving a piece of paper out the window
as the van passes by hartman lets the paper go
hartman rolls up the window happy with himself
steve slugs him in the arm
hartman laughs rubs his arm in pain
mary rushes to the ditch picks up the paper
she stops reading looks a bit uneasy
howard steps forward grabs the note
he looks at mary disgusted continues reading

she rushes to the car howard joins her
they push the car ey with everything they have it tips back onto its wheels
th jump in the car and start it up
security personnel guard the closed entrance and turn away pissed off fair patrons
at the edge of the fair grounds the ferris wheel casts a shadow over the rescue site
the whole area has been overtaken by rescuers and their equipment
police guard the tape to keep onlookers back
local media circulates
hartman kneels at the back of the ambulance holding the hand of one of the teachers
steve gets it on camera all the while looking around a bit paranoid
and what went through your mind when you realized they were gone
the teacher just bawls
hartman turns to the camera
grief too strong for words
thats the best way to describe this tragic tragic scene
one minute a merry day at the fair
the next minute helpless babes savagely sucked into the menacing abyss
the teacher bawls even harder
hartman gives her a there there then continues talking to camera
and heres how hopeless the rescue looks at this moment
the earth surrounding hole is far too perilous for anybody to approach on foot
moving heavy rescue equipment in too close could mean death for the rescuers as well
its cold down there wet dark probably a few snakes and rats moving around
hartman contd if the hearing impaired children even survived the fall theyre undoubtedly dealing with serious injuries although some may have had their fall cushioned by their deaf brothers and
sisters who dropped before them
nevertheless theyve got to be in complete misery
even if one them is telling the next itll be okay its not like he or she can hear a word of it
the coal dust covered kids sit in the dark totally unharmed
a few of them play rock paper scissors
others braid each others hair
an year old boy signs to his friend
i dont know what the hell happened but i smell a lawsuit
behind the taped off area a crowd is forming
a school bus pulls up and drops off a bunch more people
they place their stuffed animals notes flowers at the tape barrier
a bunch of them start crying
among them some familiar faces from the oklahoma protestors
rescuers keep a safe distance from the perilous hole
a rescue supervisor oversees the effort watches as a bucket is attached to the old crane barely big enough for one person
a fireman gets in the bucket doesnt fit
he gets out
a skinny fireman is pushed forward
he gets in
the bucket is lowered into the ground
hartman jumps in front of the scene
steve follows with the camera
to some a simple crane
to the trapped innocent special children the answer to their prayers
the cable lowering the bucket jerks and stops
the crowd gasps
hartman stays on camera
or is it
the cable jerks and begins moving again
only time will tell
through the crowd steve sees a woman who looks like mary from the back
fie freezes then realizes its not her
the crowd now even larger waits
howard searches for a space to park
every inch of the place is packed with cars trucks buses
please let those kids be okay
a line of cameras fixed on the opening to the hole
at the ambulances the teachers stand wrapped in blankets watching crying
steve steps a bit closer to the hole with his camera
back it up
steve backs up refocuses on the hole as the cable rises
its one of the kids finally a smiling little face appears being carried up by the fireman
theyre all okay
the rescuers cheer
the teachers bawl
the crowd goes nuts
hartman jumps in front of steves camera
elation here in louisiana but the danger far from over as rescuers bring these children up one grubby little face at a time
hartman looks off to the side holds up a finger like hes trying not to cry
he signals steve to cut
remind me next time to mention jesus
still on the lookout for mary steves not even listening
mary and howard run through the crowd
mary spots george the protestor from oklahoma and his wife
whats going on
lydia hugs her
they got eleven out
all fine thank god
more coming up
steve films as the rescued kids are wrapped in blankets the teachers hysterically crying
the fireman brings up another one
as hes raised to ground level he calls out to the rescue supervisor
thats the last of them
as he hands the kid to safety the cable jerks
he gets out of the basket just in time before the whole thing basket and cable snaps off and drops into the hole
mary celebrates with the other onlookers as if she forgot why shes there
she glances toward the rescue site and spots steve on the far side
she gets excited all over again ducks under the tape and runs toward him
steve films hartman
a happy ending thats left parents across this country wondering how can i keep my family safe from abandoned mines
are there abandoned mines in my backyard
is my childs school built on top of an abandoned mine
steve spots mary running toward him
no no no
and how oh how can these death traps be avoided
mary drops right into the abandoned mine
a monitor displays the current broadcast breaking news abandoned mine accident mary horowitz
a painful high school photo of mary appears on the screen
bad hair bad make up ridiculously large smile unfortunate frilly chemise
a guy watches the news on his laptop
staff members huddle around the tv
as all the other journalists scramble hartman and steve are a bit stunned
angus joins them puts his phone on speaker
shame about your girlfriend in the pit steve but weve got the inside advantage here so lets use it
steve shakes his head not impressed
angus takes the phone off speaker steps aside to talk to corbitt
steves phone rings
he answers it listens cringes
horowitz cries into the phone
tell her to hang on
horowitz runs down the stairs with luggage and carol the gerbil
steve listens to the phone and glares at hartman
you and your husband stay put mrs
steve contd theyll have her out before you even make it to the airport
shell be fine
he hangs up looks at hartman
she better be
hartman looks away guilty
marys voice full of misery
eight letter word for
my life has come to this
theres a bit of shuffling around in the dark
not destiny thats only seven letters
not fortuity that sounds more like when good things happen to people like finding a quarter in the sofa or something
i mean the not so great stuff thats bound to befall some people more than others
fates nasty cousin i mean
suddenly marys face lights up with her mini keychain flashlight
f o r e d m
mary shines the light on her knee
her previous cut is now gaping wound blood is all over the place
state troopers hold back the growing crowd
howard looks toward the rescue site worried
he tries to sneak under the rope but a state trooper points him back
near the hole the rescue supervisor consults with the other rescuers and a mine safety expert
the new equipment is going to take a while
lets try and find out what kind of shape our victims in
can we lower a phone down in there
not at those depths this whole area is bad enough above ground
well never get a signal down there
lets keep it simple
get me a flashlight a piece of paper and a pencil
an unenthusiastic hartman steps in front of the camera the rescuers in the shot behind him
hartman goes to speak but cant seem to summon his on air personality
oh whats the point
hartman walks away moping
angus hangs up the phone
corbitt wants you to go on air to talk about mary
an interview with the boyfriend
im not her boyfriend
come on we need this
hartman steps up listens in
fox has already got their hands on everything but her panty size
fox scooped us
steve glares at him
a retired mine supervisor comments as a graphic shows the cross section of the mine
as he talks the graphic animates with a female figure in red boots tumbling into the mine and bouncing off the walls all the way down and it plays over
that area was never reinforced up above no need since the whole eastern tunnel was blocked off in the late seventies
of course that would also affect the air quality down there
that has to be bad news for mary horowitz wouldnt you say
definitely not looking good
horowitz snaps the tv off furious and worried
an upset mrs
horowitz cracks open the curtains looks outside
who are these people
a slick young journalist stands on the sidewalk in front of the horowitz house
mary horowitz described by those who know her as smart talkative very much the girl next door that is if the girl next door has a genius level iq
shes worked for eleven years as the crossword constructor for the atlanta citizen and lives right here with her parents
horowitz opens the door an is swarmed by reporters
the slick journalist gets right in there
no mary doesnt live with us
she just came over one day and wont leave but she has her own place
can you comment on the rumors that marys fall into the mine was a suicide attempt
not our mary
the word depression isnt in her vocabulary
well its in her vocabulary obviously but no nothing ever gets her down
steady as a rock that one
mary shines her light around on the walls of the mine
black soot everywhere a mine track abandoned equipment
i am not afraid
i am not fearful pusillanimous nor am i affrighted
suddenly in the light a face
mary screams her head off
the face doesnt budge its a little deaf girl
oh my god they forgot one
you scared the crap out of me
the girl just stares at her
im sorry can you hear me i mean at all
do you have sensorineural hearing loss or conductive
deaf people can do anything except hear
you know who said that
doctor jordan first deaf president of gallaudet u
maybe youll go there one day
that is unless we perish down here
the little deaf girl just stares back
a young rescuer arrives with the flashlight pencil and paper
what should we say
tell her help is on the way
we just need her to confirm shes conscious here give me that
the supervisor grabs the paper and pencil scribbles the note ties it to the flashlight
they look up to the thin nylon rope now in place of the snapped cable
the rescue supervisor signals for them to drop it
he attaches the flashlight note waves to the crane op
the crane swings over lowers the rope into the hole
mary talks to the little girl
and then theres black lung disease also a problem in coal mines
chronic cough breathlessness cyanosis thats where your skin turns purple theres a clink behind mary
she turns her light onto the area sees the flashlight and note hanging from the thin rope
mary grabs the flashlight turns it on reads the note
at the hole the crane reels in the rope swings it away from the hole
they see the note attached flashlight gone
thats a good sign right there
the young rescuer grabs the note
whats it say
the rescue team gathers around
the young rescuer the note reads it slowly and loudly
i think you mean am i conscious not am i conscience
conscious means alert and awake
conscience is your inner morality gauge you know the thing that stops you from doing bad things e
killing stealing harming helpless animals and whatnot
can we leave her down there
he motions for the rescuer to continue
to answer your question yes i am conscious
my leg is bleeding but ill probably live
yours truly mary horowitz
the other rescuers start to disperse
did anybody lose a little deaf girl
the rescuers stop in their tracks
i found one
other than not being able to hear i mean
splashes across the screen
breaking news from louisiana weve just received word that abandoned mine victim mary horowitz is alive
horowitz watch the alive
horowitz comforts her
the mine coverage continues
also in the mine a hearing impaired child overlooked in the earlier rescue
speculation now as to whether or not mary horowitz intentionally heaved herself into the mine to save the child after rescuers ignored her pleas
nancy grace is locked and loaded
they missed a child
they missed a child
cant these people count
thank goodness for this woman this mary horowitz lets bring up that picture of her again
the picture of mary appears on the monitor
were looking at an american hero folks
it it wasnt for mary horowitz the child would have never been found
steve hartman doug and josh breathe a sigh of relief
now if they can only get her out of there
angus hangs up his phone
corbitt wants you on in five
steve sees he has no choice
hartman puts an arm around him
ill be gentle
the rescue supervisor talks to the mine safety expert
weve got the whole country watching now cant afford any more mistakes
the crane from shreveport is a wash
were looking at as much as sixteen hours to bring the other one in
if weve got carbon monoxide theres air coming in through the top
even at a concentration of ppm they could suffocate
we do not have sixteen hours
the rescue supervisor looks toward the hole of the severity and hopelessness of their situation showing on his face
lets at least get some food and water down there
the rope weve got on there now will handle a small load if that damn crane holds
he looks up at the old crane worried
gas masks oxygen supply how long
the rescue supervisor points around the area look where we are
as fast as we can get them here
might not be soon enough
this the retired mine supervisor is back with a new graphic time an image of adult and child sitting in the mine as gases swirl around them and they eventually
slump down onto the mine floor
it plays on a loop
theyre pretty much done
as night falls the crowd at the fence starts lighting and candles passing them around
among them george lydia now carlos the backpack dispensing hot cocoa guy from oklahoma
they all look on worried
howard stands at the barrier looking more worried than anybody
elizabeth pushes through the crowd to him
shes wearing red rubber boots
she hugs him
shell be okay
howard looks behind him at the ever growing crowd
he manages a sad smile
the headline mary watch is broadcast on a mammoth screen over times square
passengers are glued to a news ticker that reads mary watch evening edition newspapers are loaded onto a truck
on the front page mary watch
a pair of laundry sorters are glued to the mary watch coverage on tv
the question on everybodys mind tonight is who is mary horowitz

a nervous wal mart manager poses in the shoe department holding a pair of red rubber boots
an excited female reporter points to the boots talks on camera
exactly like the boots worn by mary horowitz when she slipped into the mine
were the boots responsible for the accident
the manufacturer refuses to comment
for now the deadly footwear remains on store shelves leaving consumers to pay the ultimate price
three fourteen year old girls shop online

steve glares at him
hartman motions for him to go on
shes smart incredibly smart

he thinks about her gets lost in it
mary horowitz doesnt pretend to be anything shes not
shes passionate beautiful real
and she definitely doesnt deserve to be where she is now
the spectators all gather candles in hand hands joined in silent prayer
an elderly couple hands howard and elizabeth candles
howard looks around at the rest of the crowd strangers watching waiting worried
they dont even know her
no but they know what its like to be alone to need a helping hand
thats a good enough reason to be here
neighbors hold a candlelight vigil on the lawn
the media catches every minute of it
bar patrons are silent glued to the mary watch coverage on the overhead tv
the old crane lowers the small rope into the hole smoke seeping out of the motor
the rescue supervisor watches anxious and helpless
the other rescuers just watch
nothing to do but wait
mary still talks
happenstance i love that word too
and you know what else mary coughs
before she has a chance to catch her breath a rope with a small bag attached quickly drops next to her the bag hitting the floor
mary unties the bag and looks inside to find water and sandwiches
did you know that the word dessert comes from an old french word that means clear the table
sometimes i feel like dinner is just doing time so i can get to the point and of course the point always involves sugar
who needs the little deaf girl covers her ears vocalizes as much as shes able
i cant hear you but you talk a lot
totally catches mary off guard
she fully takes that in
her demeanor completely shifts a calm washes over her
she sits down
she notices the little girls shoes are soaked
mary moves next to her takes off her rubber boots and puts them on the little girl
mary puts an arm around her holds her close at softly her side then speaks like shes a different person to herself the little girl unable to read her lips
im not good at
mary doesnt do quiet thats how my grandmother always said it
whats that hush
shed holler at a party
its mary about to talk then shed laugh and laugh and laugh
but i knew something they didnt that if you keep talking if you keep on talking you dont hear people telling you that youre different
you dont hear people saying they dont like you
and if youre talking you just might not hear it when some kid
calls you a freak
marys eyes start to well
i just wanted to be normal thats all
steve said i was
she thinks about it laughs a bit
im beginning to think newsmen cant entirely be trusted
she buttons up the little girls sweater
the truth is normal is not me
she seems surprised she said it out loud
theres relief in it
my friends the people ive met over the past week theyre not normal either
theyre more interesting more original more real more rare
she suddenly gets it brightens up
thats where i fit
and for she thinks about it in silence
the sadness fades the first time shes comfortably quiet
she smiles at the little deaf girl
the little deaf girl smiles back
and they sit mary totally calm
mary hears something in the distance a gentle plink plink plink she couldnt have heard while talking
she picks up the flashlight moves toward the noise
in a corner of the mine a water drip hits on some old rusted mining tools including two rusty vice grips
the little girl coughs
mary looks back at her concerned
little deaf girl its time for us to go home
howard elizabeth and carlos watch from the fence
whats taking so long
horowitz are glued to the tv

horowitz grabs her hand
the laundry sorters still glued to the mary watch coverage
quiet tension in the bar as the patrons all watch cnn
a tense night in eunice louisiana
hartman what can you tell us
doug films hartman
in the shot behind him smoke seeps out of the old crane
theyve lowered food and water into the depths of this abandoned mine
the last task of this archaic crane that finally blew its motor
weve been told the new rescue equipment wont make it until daybreak
until then all we can do is wait hope and of course pray
theres a commotion at the rescue site
doug zooms in
the rope hanging into the hole is moving
rescuers get as close to the hole as possible
tell me shes not
mary cuts two pieces of excess rope off the bottom attaches each it to the hanging rope using the vice grips as makeshift climbing ascenders
after i got kicked out of girl scouts while the other girls were learning how to sell cookies i was at home reading the biography of sir edmund hillary
mary motions for the little deaf girl to jump on piggyback
she jumps up onto marys back still in the red rubber boots
mary starts jugging up the rope the vice grips and rope pieces acting like ladder steps
they start rising up slowly
not an easy task
mary struggles every step
a shot of the moving rope up above the hole is broadcast
people on the street stop and watch
the guys at the bar stand up to watch to the shot of the moving rope on tv
horowitz on the edge of their seats in front of the mary watch tv coverage
the little deaf girl helps mary move one of the vice grips up the rope
if life is like a crossword puzzle then its worth its greatness its raison defre should be judged in the same way
mary grasps the cable with everything she has pulls up another step
is it solvable
one of the red boots drops down into the mine shaft
every eye is on the moving rope
mary looks up as the lights above get closer and closer
is it entertaining
as the rescuers firemen troopers media and public look on mary at last appears above ground the little girl in her arms
does it sparkle
the crowd goes nuts
rescuers rush to help them onto the ground
an ambulance attendant grabs the little girl wraps her in a blanket
marys eyes flutter in the blinding lights of the cameras pointed at her
she scans the entire crowd
and does it fit
her eyes fix on a spot in the crowd
she starts running
horowitz hands her husband the box of kleenex as they wail and watch mary on tv safely above ground
the customers eat pie while theyre glued to images of mary and the little girl
good for her

he shakes his head laughs
everybody in the bar celebrates
the bartender rings the bell
the career day teacher watches mary on tv wipes her eyes
the laundry sorters celebrate then realize their laundry is all pink
the large kid from the career day class walks into the living room where his dad has mary watch on tv
the kid holds up a crossword half done and hes not happy about it

the kid grabs a pencil to finish the puzzle
takihashi watches mary on tv wipes his tears

a greyhound bus travels
