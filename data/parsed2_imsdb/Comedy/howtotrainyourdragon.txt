written by dean deblois chris sanders final draft february we skim above a dark wild ocean
the camera turns toward a lone island berk
it is a gigantic shard of rock jutting straight out of the water
this is berk
its twelve days north of hopeless and a few degrees south of freezing to death
its located solidly on the meridian of misery
the camera drifts over rolling hills to reveal a small village nestled on an outcropping of sea mounts
in a word sturdy
and its been here for seven generations but every single building is new
the camera drifts closer circling
we have fishing hunting and a charming view of the sunsets
the only problems are the pests
you see most places have mice or mosquitos
sheep graze peacefully on a hillside
suddenly one is snatched
a door is pulled open
as a dragon swoops directly toward it blasting fire
the door is slammed
the fire shoots through the slats of wood illuminating hiccup a gangly teenage viking
he reopens the sizzling door as leaps off of the front porch
he weaves through the erupting mayhem as vikings pour out of the buildings ready for a fight
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
more dragons swarm in setting rooftops alight and hauling off sheep
most people would leave
we have stubbornness issues
vikings sound the alarm
viking men and women pour out into the streets axes in hand
on hiccup darting through alleys staying under eaves making his way through the battle
my names hiccup
great name i know
but its not the worst
parents believe a hideous name will frighten off gnomes and trolls
like our charming viking demeanor wouldnt do that
dragons sweep back and forth dodging axes and blasting the vikings who throw them
a burly warrior gets tossed in an explosion knocking hiccup to the ground
cheery insane mornin
hiccup gets to his feet and continues to rush past gigantic men and women
meet the neighbors
hoark the haggard
what are you doing out
burnthair the broad
phlegma the fierce
get back inside
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
he passes a silent ox of a viking picking his ear
yep just ack
enter stoick the biggest viking of all
he yanks hiccup from the path of a strafing dragon and holds aloft to the crowd
accusingly to the crowd what is he doing out again
what are you doing out
the flames light up his scowling face and matted red beard
he sets hiccup down and turns to the sky searching
thats stoick the vast
chief of the tribe
they say that when he was a baby he popped a dragons head clean off of its shoulders
do i believe it
stoick grabs a wooden cart and hurls it knocking the strafing dragon out of the sky
yes i do
an explosion forces vikings to duck
stoick stands firm brushing flaming debris off of his shoulder
barking to his men what have we got
oh and hoark saw a monstrous nightmare
any night furies
none so far
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
hoist the torches
massive flaming braziers are raised on poles lighting up the night sky
and revealing swirling dragons of all types
below hiccup crosses an open plaza and ducks into an open building with a tall chimney
he crosses behind a counter where a peg legged one armed hulk of a blacksmith reshapes blades with a hammer and tongs appendage
nice of you to join the party
i thought youd been carried off
hiccup dons a leather apron and starts to put away gobbers scattered appendages
nah come on
im way too muscular for their taste
they wouldnt know what to do with all this
hiccup strikes a bodybuilder pose
they need toothpicks dont they
hiccup gets to work transferring bent and chipped weapons to the forge as vikings crowd the counter for replacements
the meathead with attitude and interchangeable hands is gobber
ive been his apprentice ever since i was little
we move to the lower defenses
well counter attack with the catapults
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
armed men rush past flanking others who carry sheep to safety
stoick follows up the rear as overhead a dragon strafes the rooftops with napalm like fire
lots and lots of new houses
in response the fire brigade charges through the plaza four teens tugging a large wooden cask on wheels
from it they fill buckets of water to douse the flames
one among them is a cute energetic viking girl
hiccup leans out of the stall to watch her
oh and thats fishlegs snotlout
the twins ruffnut and tuffnut
a slow motion explosion erupts behind her framing her in a sexy ball of fire
the others join her looking awesome and heroic
their job is so much cooler
hiccup tries to join them as they pass but hes hooked by gobber and hoisted back inside
ah come on
let me out please
i need to make my mark
oh youve made plenty of marks
all in the wrong places
please two minutes
ill kill a dragon
my life will get infinitely better
i might even get a date
you cant lift a hammer
you cant swing an axe
gobber grabs a bola iron balls connected by rope
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
you cant even throw one of these
a viking runs by and nabs it out of gobbers hand hurling it at a dive bombing gronkle
the bola binds its legs sending it into a heavy crash
ready with the answer okay fine but
he rushes to the back corner of the stall and presents a bizarre wheel barrow like contraption
this will throw it for me
hiccup opens the hinged lid of the device
an arm springs up equipped with twin bows
they prematurely launch a bola narrowly missing gobber
and taking out a viking at the counter
see now this right here is what im talking about
mild calibration issue
if you ever want to get out there to fight dragons you need to stop all
gobber gestures in hiccups general direction
you just pointed to all of me
stop being all of you
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
you sir are playing a dangerous game
keeping this much raw
there will be consequences
gobber tosses him a sword
ill take my chances
hiccup takes it begrudgingly and lobs it onto the grinding wheel
one day ill get out there
because killing a dragon is everything around here
nadders land gathering like seagulls around a seemingly vacant house
a nadder head is sure to get me at least noticed
the nadders clamber onto the building tearing the roof and walls apart
sheep pour out and scatter
elsewhere hippo like gronckles pick drying racks clean of fish and fly off like loaded pelicans
gronckles are tough
taking down one of those would definitely get me a girlfriend
a stealthy snake like dragon head peeks over a rooftop breathing gas into a chimney
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
two heads twice the status
a second head pokes through the door and lights it
the two heads fly through the explosion their necks zipping together to reveal a single body
it flies past stoick as he climbs to the top of a catapult they found the sheep
concentrate fire over the lower bank
boulders are catapulted at the corralling nadders
just as a huge red dragon whips past spraying the base of the catapult with sticky fire
and then theres the monstrous nightmare
only the best vikings go after those
they have this nasty habit of setting themselves on fire
it emerges from the flames climbing the catapult with a leering toothy grin
ill take care of this
stoick takes on the nightmare face to hammer
suddenly a loud ballistic moaning streaks overhead
the catapult crew ducks
on hiccup looking up from his work reacting to the same sound
but the ultimate prize is the dragon no one has ever seen
we call it the dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
vikings everywhere take shelter
the moaning sound builds
the monstrous nightmare suddenly stops fighting and takes flight
stoick looks skyward
the catapult explodes as though hit by an artillery shell
sending stoick and the crew leaping for their lives
this thing never steals food never shows itself and
the sound recedes leaving the crippled catapult in flames
no one has ever killed a night fury
thats why im going to be the first
gobber trades his hammer for an axe
man the fort hiccup they need me out there
turns with a threatening glare
you know what i mean
gobber charges into the fray hollering
on hiccup a smirk crosses his face
hiccup pushes his wheeled contraption through a wall of clustered vikings
he weaves through the ongoing mayhem as fast as his legs can carry him
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
hiccup where are you going
come back here
be right back
the nadders have cornered the house full of sheep
they close in ready to spring upon them
stoick suddenly appears hurling fishing nets over them
the surprised nadders are caught
stoick and his men rush in
a nadder blasts a hole through its net
stoick leaps onto it clamping his thick arms around its head forcing its jaws shut
the devils still have some juice in them
hiccup reaches a cliff overlooking the smoking catapult and drops the handles to the ground
he cranks several levers unfolding and then cocking the bowed arms of his contraption
he drops a bola onto a chamber and then pivots the weapon on a gimbal head toward the dark sky
he listens with his eye pressed to the scope hand poised on the trigger
he hears the night fury approaching
and turns his aim to the defense tower
it closes in for the final strike completely camouflaged in the night
give me something to shoot at give me something to shoot at
the tower topples
the blast of fire illuminates the dragon for a split second
hiccup pulls the trigger
the flexed arms snap forward springing the weapon off the ground
the bola disappears into the sky followed by a whack and a screech
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
surprised then elated oh i hit it
yes i hit it
did anybody see that
hiccups victory is short lived
a monstrous nightmare appears slithering up over the lip of the cliff
except for you
on stoick holding down the netted nadders
he hears a familiar holler and looks up to see
hiccup running through the plaza screaming with the nightmare fast on his heels
alarmed stoick abandons the nadders and runs off
to his men re the do not let them escape
vikings scatter as hiccup dodges a near fatal blast
the nightmares sticky napalm like fire splashes up onto buildings setting them alight
hiccup ducks behind the last standing brazier the only shelter available
the nightmare blasts it spraying fire all around him
hiccup peers around the smoldering post
no sign of the nightmare
he turns back to find it leering at him blocking his escape
it takes a deep breath
hiccup is finished
suddenly stoick leaps between them tackling the nightmare to the ground
they tumble and wrestle resuming their earlier fight
the nightmare tries to toast him but only coughs up smoke
youre all out
he smashes the nightmare repeatedly in the face driving it away
it takes to the air and disappears
winded stoick turns to hiccup
oh and theres one more thing you need to know
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
the burnt brazier pole collapses sending the massive iron basket crashing
it bounces down the hill destroying as it goes and scattering the vikings who were holding down the netted nadders
the freed dragons escape
with several sheep in tow
the escaped nadders fly past with sheep in their clutches
the raid is over
the dragons have clearly won
the murmuring crowd eyes stoick awaiting his response
okay but i hit a night fury
stoick grabs hiccup by the back scruff of his collar and hauls him away fuming with embarrassment
its not like the last few times dad
i mean i really actually hit it
you guys were busy and i had a very clear shot
it went down just off raven point
lets get a search party out there before it stop
he releases hiccup
everyone goes silent staring expectantly
every time you step outside disaster follows
can you not see that i have bigger problems
winters almost here and i have an entire village to feed
hiccup looks around
all eyes are upon him
between you and me the village could do with a little less feeding dont ya think
a few rotund vikings stir self consciously
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
this isnt a joke hiccup
why cant you follow the simplest orders
i cant stop myself
i see a dragon and i have to just
kill it you know
its who i am dad
you are many things hiccup
but a dragon killer is not one of them
hiccup looks around to see many nods of agreement
get back to the house
make sure he gets there
i have his mess to clean up
stoick lumbers off in the opposite direction
gobber leads hiccup through the walk of shame
they pass the teen fire brigade as they snicker
quite the performance
ive never seen anyone mess up that badly
thank you thank you
i was trying so
hiccup avoids astrids glare and heads up toward a large house standing prominently on the hill above the others
i really did hit one
he never listens
well it runs in the family
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
and when he does its always with this
like someone skimped on the meat in his sandwich
excuse me barmaid
im afraid you brought me the wrong offspring
i ordered an extra large boy with beefy arms
extra guts and glory on the side
this is a talking fish bone
youre thinking about this all wrong
its not so much what you look like
its whats inside that he cant stand
thank you for summing that up
they reach the doorway
look the point is stop trying so hard to be something youre not
hiccup sighs heavily
i just want to be one of you guys
gobber eyes him sympathetically
hiccup turns and goes through the front door
and straight out the back door
he hurries off into the woods determined
a noisy din of protesting voices leads to
stoick glowering in the firelight
surrounded by his men
either we finish them or theyll finish us
its the only way well be rid of them
if we find the nest and destroy it the dragons will leave
theyll find another home
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
he sinks his blade into a
large nautical map spread out on the table
the blade pierces the middle of an uncharted corner swirling with painted sea monsters and dragons
one more search
before the ice sets in
those ships never come back
its an occupational hazard
now whos with me
stoick throws up his fist
no one follows
the crowds shifts in restless silence
todays not good for me
ive gotta do my axe returns
those who stay will look after hiccup
hands jut into the air volunteers galore
enthusiastic murmurs of prep and packing fill the room
to the ships
im with you stoick
thats more like it
the vikings rush for the door leaving gobber and stoick alone
gobber gulps back the contents of his tankard attachment and scrapes back the bench
ill pack my undies
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
no i need you to stay and train some new recruits
and while im busy hiccup can cover the stall
molten steel razor sharp blades lots of time to himself
what could possibly go wrong
stoick sinks onto the bench beside gobber his brow burdened
what am i going to do with him gobber
put him in training with the others
no im serious
so am i
stoick turns to him glaring
hed be killed before you let the first dragon out of its cage
oh you dont know that
i do know that actually
no you dont
no actually i do
no you dont
you know what hes like
from the time he could crawl hes been
he doesnt listen
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
has the attention span of a sparrow
i take him fishing and he goes hunting for
they steal your socks
but only the left ones
whats with that
when i was a boy
oh here we go
my father told me to bang my head against a rock and i did it
i thought it was crazy but i didnt question him
and you know what happened
you got a headache
that rock split in two
it taught me what a viking could do gobber
he could crush mountains level forests tame seas
even as a boy i knew what i was what i had to become
hiccup is not that boy
you cant stop him stoick
you can only prepare him
look i know it seems hopeless
but the truth is you wont always be around to protect him
hes going to get out there again
hes probably out there now
on stoick as gobbers words hit their mark
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
a drawn map of the island covered in xs
hiccup looks up from it and peeks over a gorge expectantly
he adds another x to the page then scratches his pencil over the whole map in frustration
he snaps the book closed and pockets it
uggh the gods hate me
some people lose their knife or their mug
no not me
i manage to lose an entire dragon
hiccup whacks a low hanging branch
it snaps back at him hitting him in the face
he looks up to see a snapped tree trunk
his eyes follow it to a long trench of up turned earth
he follows it to a downed black dragon its body and tail tangled in a bola
it appears dead
hiccup approaches beaming
i did it
i did it
this fixes everything
he strikes a victory pose planting his foot on the fallen night fury
i have brought down this mighty beast
it suddenly shifts
hiccup springs back terrified
he turns his blade on it
rattled hiccup creeps along the length of the weak wounded dragon dagger poised to strike
as he reaches the head hiccup finds the night fury staring coldly at him
hiccup tries to look away but hes drawn back to its unnerving unflinching stare
with the dragon safety tangled in the ropes hiccup jabs with his dagger puffing himself up with false bravado
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
im going to kill you dragon
im gonna cut out your heart and take it to my father
im a viking
i am a viking
hiccup raises the dagger determined to prove his viking ness
the dragons labored breathing breaks hiccups clenched concentration
he opens an eye uncertainty leaking through
the dragon holds the stare
something profound is exchanged
finally the night fury closes its eye and lowers its head resigned to its fate
hiccup tries to go through with it holding the dagger aloft
until finally lowering it with a frustrated sigh
he looks over the dragons chaffed rope wounds
muttered ashamed i did this
he turns to leave
and glances back at the dragon chest heaving
he checks over his shoulder to ensure that no one is watching
then hurries back to cut the ropes
the night furys eye shoots open
with the dragon watching his every move hiccup hurriedly saws through the bola ropes
as the last rope falls free the night fury suddenly pounces
in a blur the dragon is upon him pinning hiccup down grazing his neck
looking like its about to kill him
hiccup is paralyzed
the dragons breath ruffles his hair
hiccup opens his eyes to find the night furys wolf like stare boring into him
the exchange is intense profound
the dragon draws a deep breath as though its about to torch him then lets out an ear piercing scream instead
it turns and takes flight flapping violently through the canopy of trees
it bashes against a nearby mountain side recovers and drops out of view some distance away
winded hiccup struggles to his feet staggers a few steps collapses to his knees and faints
hiccup enters to see
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
stoick seated on a thick slice of tree trunk
he is slouched over the fire pit stirring the coals with his axe
embers waft around his beard
hiccup tries to sneak past up the stairs to his room
stoick seems none the wiser when
stoick stands takes a deep breath
i have to talk to you dad
i need to speak with you too son
hiccup and stoick straighten at the same moment
ive decided i dont want to i think its time you learn fight dragons
to fight dragons
you go first
no you go first
you get your wish
you start in the morning
oh man i shouldve gone first
uh cause i was thinking you know we have a surplus of dragon fighting vikings but do we have enough bread making vikings or small home youll need this
stoick hands hiccup his axe
hiccup avoids taking it
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
i dont want to fight dragons
yes you do
dad i cant kill dragons
but you will kill dragons
no im really very extra sure that i wont
its time hiccup
can you not hear me
this is serious son
stoick forces the axe into hiccups hands
its weight drags him down
he looks up to see stoick under lit with firelight
when you carry this axe
you carry all of us with you
which means you walk like us
you talk like us
you think like us
no more of
specifically at hiccup this
you just gestured to all of me
this conversation is feeling very one sided
hiccup glances at the axe in his hands
its a no win argument
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
satisfied stoick grabs his helmet and duffel bag
and heads for the door
ill be back
and ill be here
stoick heads out the door leaving hiccup holding the axe
gobber raises a massive iron gate at the entrance of a vast stone arena
welcome to dragon training
the recruits file through the gate and out onto the arena floor
they take it in like gladiators entering the colosseum
the walls are covered in scorched silhouettes of blasted vikings
its a grim yet awe inspiring place
no turning back
i hope i get some serious burns
im hoping for some mauling like on my shoulder or lower back
yeah its only fun if you get a scar out of it
yeah no kidding right
the recruits turn to see hiccup behind them
groans all around
who let him in
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
lets get started
the recruit who does best will win the honor of killing his first dragon in front of the entire village
hiccup already killed a night fury so does that disqualify him or
the recruits laugh and chatter in the background
can i transfer to the class with the cool vikings
gobber throws a supportive arm around hiccup and ushers him along
cheery in confidence dont worry
youre small and youre weak
thatll make you less of a target
theyll see you as sick or insane and go after the more viking like teens instead
gobber stick him in line with the others and continues on toward five massive reinforced doors
terrible roars and bellows issue from within
behind these doors are just a few of the many species you will learn to fight
fishlegs bounces and giggles with excitement barely able to contain himself
the deadly nadder
under his breath speed eight
the hideous zippleback
plus eleven stealth
the monstrous nightmare
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
the terrible terror
quietly to himself jaw strength eight
gobber pulls a lever raising the cross beam on the last of the doors
arent you gonna teach us first
i believe in learning on the job
a gronckle thunders out of its cave charging into the ring like an irate rhino
the recruits scramble in every direction
except for ruffnut and tuffnut who rush toward it like pumped up rodeo clowns
today is about survival
if you get blasted youre dead
quick whats the first thing youre going to need
plus five speed
the recruits scramble for shields finding them scattered around the ring
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
your most important piece of equipment is your shield
if you must make a choice between a sword or a shield take the shield
hiccup struggles to lift his
gobber helps him and sends him running
ruff and tuff stand amidst a dozen shields
but only one has a skull painted on it
they both grab it
get your hands off my shield
there are like a million shields
take that one it has a flower on it
girls like flowers
ruffnut uses the shield to bash tuffnut in the face
he doesnt let go
ooops now this one has blood on it
the gronckle takes aim at the distracted twins
the shield is blasted out of both of their hands
tuff and ruff spin like tops and go down
tuffnut ruffnut youre out
the gronckle scoops up a pile of rocks and swallows them back
the teens gather on the far side of the ring
those shields are good for another thing
make lots of it to throw off a dragons aim
the kids scoop up weapons and begin hammering on their shields
the gronckle shakes its head at the clatter
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
gronckles pov the teens targets become blurry and scrambled
all dragons have a limited number of shots
how many does a gronckle have
thats one for each of you
i really dont think my parents bam
fishlegs has his shield blasted away
gobber spots hiccup hiding from the gronckles molten slugs
hiccup get in there
on astrid bouncing on her heels ready to dodge a blast
snotlout appears trying to hit on her
so anyway im moving into my parents basement
you should come by sometime to work out
you look like you work out she cartwheels out of the way allowing a shot to shoot past her and hit snotlouts shield
hes blasted onto his back
astrid rolls to a stop beside hiccup who stirs awkwardly trying to look cool
so i guess its just you and me huh
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
astrid rolls away
a split second later a lava slug knocks hiccups shield clear off of his arm
hiccup is exposed
one shot left
hiccup panics and chases after his shield as it rolls across the ring
the sudden movement sends the gronckle chasing after him leaving astrid in the clear
the gronckle drives straight toward hiccup pinning him against the wall
it opens its mouth and cocks its tail ready to fire point blank
gobber lunges in and hooks the gronckles mouth at the last second causing its head to jerk back and fire against the stone wall above hiccups head
rattled but masking it and thats six
gobber wrestles the irate gronckle back into his pen
go back to bed ya overgrown sausage
youll get another chance dont you worry
gobber turns to the recruits
a dragon will always with a stern look to always go for the kill
he hoists hiccup to his feet and walks off
hiccup looks overhead to see a steaming pit in the solid stone wall
hiccup battered after another disastrous day in the ring
he studies the remnants of the discarded bola
revealing that hes back at the scene of the crime
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
why didnt you
he drops the bola and presses on in the direction it flew off
he drops into a rocky crevice and follows it to an
isolated cove complete with a pristine spring pool
he scans the high stone walls
then notices a single black scale on the ground
he crouches and picks it up studying it
well this was stupid
suddenly the night fury blasts past him
hiccup recoils watching the massive beast struggle to climb the walls
it flaps violently then peels away to a rough landing
the dragon is trapped
hiccup grins excited to see it again and slips closer
he watches as the dragon exhausted and frustrated leaps into the air beating its wings furiously
again and again it rolls uncontrolled and crashes heavily
as if remembering to snap a photo hiccup pulls a leather bound book and flips past drawings of weapons to a blank page
he sketches the dragon quickly desperate to record the image
the fury claws at the steep rock walls trying climb out of the cove
it slips and falls hard crushing several saplings
the fury rolls back to his feet and slowly crawls to the waters edge
he spots fish in the shallow water and snaps at them
but comes up empty
he lowers his head looking weakened
why dont you just
on hiccup as he spots the problem
he adjusts his drawing carefully erasing one half of the dragons tail
he accidentally drops the charcoal stick
it rolls off of the rock outcropping that hides him from view and bounces into the cove
the night fury raises his head spotting hiccup
they exchange a profound unflinching stare
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
a storm is brewing outside
the great doors rattle on their hinges
where did astrid go wrong in the ring today
the recruits are seated at a table eating dinner by the glow of the fire pit
i mistimed my summersault dive
it was sloppy
it threw off my reverse tumble
eye rolls from the group
grabbing astrids hand no no you were great
that was so astrid
shes right you have to be tough on yourselves
all eyes turn to hiccup entering the hall sheepishly
gobber glares at him
glaring at hiccup where did hiccup go wrong
he tries to take a seat at the table
he showed up
he didnt get eaten
but the recruits keep closing the gaps
rolling his eyes hiccup sits at the vacant table next to them
hes never where he should be
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
thank you astrid
you need to live and breathe this stuff
gobber lays a giant book in the center of the table
the dragon manual
everything we know about every dragon we know of
a rumble of thunder shakes the hall
rain pours down outside
no attacks tonight
gobber exits into the storm leaving the teens staring at the book
youve got to be kidding wait you mean read
while were still alive
why read words when you can just kill the stuff the words tell you stuff about
ive read it like seven times
theres this water dragon that sprays boiling water at your face
and theres this other one that buries itself for like a week
the teens stare as fishlegs goes on too long
yeah that sounds great
there was a chance i was going to read that
snotlout gets up to go
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
you guys read ill go kill stuff
the others follow with fishlegs in tow
oh and theres this other one that has these spines that look like trees
astrid is the last to go
so i guess well share read it
she pushes it toward him and leaves
all mine then
wow so okay
opening the massive book
thunder booms outside
the hall is vacant and dark but for the few candles hes pulled together
hiccup pours through page after page of strange and frightening dragons
hiccup turns the page
this reclusive dragon inhabits sea caves and dark tide pools
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
when startled the thunderdrum produces a concussive sound that can kill a man at close range
kill on sight
hiccups eyes drift to a lurid illustration of decapitated vikings
another page another dragon
this gigantic creature has razor sharp wings that can slice through full grown trees
kill on sight
the illustrations seem to take on a life of their own shifting and squirming in the candlelight
sprays scalding water at its victim
the storm outside rages against the shuttered windows
hiccup is startled but presses on
even newly hatched dragons can spray acid
kill on sight
he begins flipping through the pages
a blur of dragons
burns its victims
buries its victims
chokes its victims
turns its victims inside out
kill on sight
kill on sight
kill on sight
hiccup finally lands upon the page hes been looking for
its blank no image save for a few sparse details
the unholy offspring of lightning and death itself
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
never engage this dragon
your only chance hide and pray it does not find you
hiccup pulls his sketchbook out of his vest and opens it to his drawing of toothless
he lays it over the books blank page and considers it
close on the drawing of toothless
a painted dragon with a sword run through it
its the billowing sail of stoicks ship
stoick hovers over the familiar nautical map his eyes on the uncharted corner swirling in mist and illustrations of dragons
i can almost smell them
stoick raises his gaze to
an epic fog bank towering from sky to sea like a bruised daunting curtain beyond which nothing is visible
the three ships drift alongside it skirting its solid edge looking for an opening
on deck the crewmen mill nervously all too aware of what stoick is considering
take us in
the helmsman steers stoicks ship into the fog
the men draw their weapons prepping for the worst
hard to port
for helheims gate
the first ship disappears into the whiteout followed by the other two
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
suddenly a flash of light
a silhouette of a dragon
sounds of splitting and shattering wood
plunges into the water
another bright flash
close on a dragon painted onto a shield
hiccup runs his finger over its outline
you know i just happened to notice the book had nothing on night furies
is there another book
or a sequel
maybe a little night fury pamphlet
a blast takes the axe head off of hiccups hilt leaving a smoking hole behind him
hiccup yelps and runs
youre not even trying
cut back to reveal a deadly nadder loose in a maze like arrangement of moveable walls
gobber calls orders from above
is all about attack
the nadder hops from wall to wall sending the recruits scurrying
nadders are quick and light on their feet
your job is to be quicker and lighter
the teens move in stumbling over hiccup and his unwieldy shield
the nadder spots fishlegs ample rear hiding behind a wall
it whips its tail of spikes
fishlegs screams and lifts an entire wall to shield himself from the spray
im really beginning to question your teaching methods
look for its blind spot
every dragon has one
find it hide in it and strike
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
ruff and tuff rush in diving and rolling up to the nadders nose
the nadder sniffs the air it cant see them
tuff and ruff are smashed together too close for comfort
do you ever bathe
if you dont like it then just get your own blind spot
how about i give you one
ruff and tuff shove each other till their movement and noise gives them away
the nadder attacks snapping at both of them
not so much
hiccup wanders up to gobber while the others dart past
hey so how would one sneak up on a night fury
none ones ever met one and lived to tell the tale
now get in there
i know i know but hypothetically
she puts her finger to her lips and gestures for him to hide
a moment later the nadder leaps over the walls surprising them by landing in front of her
astrid somersaults into its blind spot confusing it
she rears back to strike just as snotlout leaps in protectively sweeping astrid behind him
watch out babe
ill take care of this
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
astrid glares at him
the sun was in my eyes astrid
what do you want me to do block out the sun
i could do that but i dont have time right now
the nadder tears off after her knocking down walls in pursuit
she leaps and dives like a highly trained gymnast
hiccup wanders up to gobber again
they probably take the daytime off
you know like a cat
has anyone ever seen one napping
hiccup spins around to see the maze walls collapsing like dominos toward him
astrid comes flying through the dust and crash lands on top of him laying him out in a limb tangled mess
love on the battlefield
she could do better
the nadder closes in emerging through the cloud of dust
struggling to untangle just
why dont you
the nadder spins around and races back toward them like a raptor
astrid untangles herself and tries to pull her axe from hiccups shield
which is attached to his limp gangly arm
she plants her foot on his torso and yanks the axe free still burrowed into the shield
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
she spins and swings the axe and shield scoring a direct hit on the oncoming nadders nose
it yelps and scurries off
well done astrid
gobber hobbles off to wrestle the nadder back into his cave
hiccup gets to his feet all eyes are upon him
he turns to find astrid glaring at him winded
is this some kind of a joke to you
our parents war is about to become ours
figure out which side youre on
she grabs her axe and stomps off
hiccup watches stung
being thrown into the cove
it hits the ground and slides
a moment later hiccup peeks through a gap in the rock looking around cautiously
hiccup squeezes through and enters the cove
a beat then hiccup hears a snort from behind him
hiccup turns to see the night fury crouched on a rock like a stealthy panther
it descends approaching him
ready to pounce
hiccup swallows his fear and offers the fish
doing so reveals the dagger at his waist
the dragon sees it and hisses
hiccup reaches for it eliciting a growl
he pauses carefully lifts it by the handle and tosses it away
the dragon calms
as it approaches the fish hiccup notices that its missing teeth
i couldve sworn you had
a set of razor sharp teeth emerge from its gums to grab the fish
toothless snatches and gnashes it up swallowing it
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
the teeth retract again
toothless presses closer with an expectant look
hiccup retreats nervously
no i dont have any more
the fury backs hiccup against a rock placing himself the same position as before
the dragon closes in over him staring blankly
a tense moment passes
then toothless regurgitates a chunk of fish onto hiccups lap
they exchange stares
hiccup realizes what toothless wants him to do
hiccup crouches slowly and squeamishly picks it up
the dragon waits expectantly
hiccup gags and gnaws off a bite of the slimy fish
he forces a smile
toothless mimics him
amazed hiccup sits up and tries to touch him
toothless hisses and flaps off to a crash on the other side of the cove
he blasts the mossy ground to a red hot temperature
and curls up on it like a giant dog
he turns to find hiccup seated beside him
toothless tolerates his persistent presence
until hiccup tries to touch his damaged tail
toothless snaps at him
hiccup takes the hint and leaves
its magic hour
toothless wakes hanging upside down from a tree
he spots hiccup sitting on the other side of the cove
sketching in the sand
close on a sketch of toothless
hiccup draws with a stick minding his own business
toothless appears behind him watching carefully
aware of his presence hiccup continues trying not to scare him off
toothless walks off
a moment later he reappears with an entire sapling drawing lines in the sand
he rushes here and there making haphazard lines in every direction
finally toothless drops the tree and inspects his work
he seems pleased
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
hiccup stands and takes in the sprawling scribble amazed by it
he accidentally steps onto one of the lines eliciting an instant growl from toothless
he steps on it again
toothless growls again
realizing how sensitive he is hiccup steps carefully between each line turning round and round until he unwittingly bumps into toothless
once again theyre face to face
hiccup slowly extends his hand
hiccup turns his head away and closes his eyes
to his amazement toothless bridges the gap and presses his muzzle against hiccups hand
in a flash the dragon is gone leaving hiccup astounded
gobber and the recruits are seated at the top of an abandoned catapult tower toasting campfire food around a roaring bonfire
and with one twist he took my hand and swallowed it whole
and i saw the look on his face
cant deny it i was delicious
he must have passed the word because it wasnt a month before another one of them took my leg
isnt it weird to think that your hand was inside a dragon
like if your mind was still in control of it you could have killed the dragon from the inside by crushing his heart or something
i swear im so angry right now
ill avenge your beautiful hand and your beautiful foot
ill chop off the legs of every dragon i fight with my face
he postures to astrid
she rolls her eyes
with a mouthful un unh
its the wings and the tails you really want
if it cant fly it cant get away
a downed dragon is a dead dragon
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
on hiccup hiding his horrified look form the others
gobber stands and stretches
im off to bed
you should be too
tomorrow we get into the big boys
slowly but surely making our way up to the monstrous nightmare
playful taunting but wholl win the honor of killing it
he hobbles off
the teens reflect
very matter of fact its gonna be me
its my destiny
tuffnut rolls up his sleeve to reveal a red dragon on his arm
your mom let you get a tattoo
its not a tattoo
its a birthmark
okay ive been stuck with you since birth and that was never there before
yes it was
youve just never seen me from the left side until now
it wasnt there yesterday
is it a birthmark or a today mark
hiccup gets up and walks away from the group
astrid watches him as he leaves the bonfire
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
hiccup enters a small room at the back of the stall
its covered in drawings of weaponry and scale models
he lights a candle and lays his sketchbook out on the desk opening it to the drawing of toothless
with a look of determination
hiccup picks up a charcoal stick and re draws the missing tail
a creaking leather bellows
the stone forge glows with every pump
tongs pull intricate iron pieces from the coals
theyre dropped onto the anvil twisted lightly hammered and dunked in a barrel
the pieces are carried to hiccups workbench and laid out in place on a one to one schematic
its a sketch of a mechanical fin
hiccup arrives winded straining under the weight of a full basket
he clicks the scale he found like a jar top
toothless approaches sniffing him
i brought breakfast
i hope youre hungry
hiccup drops the basket and kicks it over
fish spill out
okay thats disgusting
toothless approaches settling in to devour the feast
weve got some salmon
toothless swallows it
some nice icelandic cod
swallows those too
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
and a whole smoked eel
toothless nabs it chews a few times then spits it out
he shakes his head violently snorts and scrubs his massive tongue on the sand
hiccup takes note
no no no
yeah i dont like eel much either
toothless focuses on the remainder
with the dragon distracted hiccup unwraps his prosthetic fin and opens it like a fan
thats it just stick with good stuff
and dont you mind me
ill just be back
minding my own business
hiccup cautiously approaches the injured tail but every time he gets near it toothless sweeps it away like a cat
hiccup drops a knee on top of the tail
toothless head juts up slows its chewing to a halt
the dragon tenses slowly spreading his wings
hiccup straps the prosthetic fin in place
he cinches the straps
not too bad
he snaps his massive wings and takes to the air carrying hiccup with him
hiccup struggles to hold on to the tail
as the ground speeds away toothless immediately tips into a uncontrolled bank and dive
hiccup sees the folded fin rattling uselessly in opposition to its flared counterpart
flap as he may toothless cant correct his trajectory
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
hiccup swallows his fear and crawls toward the folded prosthetic
he reaches it and yanks it open
the flared fan like appendage catches the air stabilizing the twisting tail
excited terrified its working
toothless arcs just short of the water and climbs
high into the air
yes i did it
he glances back at hiccup busily holding the tail open while trying to hold on
theyre going to crash
hiccup is suddenly thrown from the tail in the intense force of a turn
he bounces across the waters surface and takes a dive
without hiccup to operate the tail toothless does the same plunging in a massive cannonball
hiccup resurfaces roughed up but beaming
toothless appears seconds later
today is about teamwork
work together and you might survive
on a double wide door
gas seeps through the cracks
it blasts open
a cloud of smoke engulfs the ring swirling around the paired up teens
astrid with ruffnut
snotlout with tuffnut
fishlegs with hiccup
all carry buckets of water poised to throw them
now a wet dragon head cant light its fire
the hideous zippleback is extra tricky
one head breathes gas the other head lights it
your job is to know which is which
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
the smoke encircles them cutting them off from each other
the teens listen and watch for any sign of the dragon
muttering to himself razor sharp serrated teeth that inject venom for pre digestion
prefers ambush attack crushing its victims in its
will you please stop that
moving nervously through the fog back to back
snotlout is singing to himself to calm his nerves
if that dragon shows either of his faces im gonna spotting an approaching shape terrified there
snotlout and tuffnut hurl their water into the fog
its us idiots
astrid and ruffnut are soaked
your butts are getting bigger
we thought you were a dragon
not that theres anything wrong with a dragon esque figure
astrid elbows snotlout in the face
ruffnut drops tuffnut with a punch to the throat
a tail sweeps out of the fog taking them down
their buckets spill
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
on fishlegs and hiccup coming across them
they see the puddles of spilled water
oh im hurt
i am very much hurt
chances of survival are dwindling into single digits now
a zippleback head emerges out of the smoke
fishlegs hurls his water at it completely dousing the head
it leers and opens its mouth spewing gas into the area
gas flows around their legs
fishlegs flees in a panic
a clicking sound comes from behind them
sparks flash in the smoke
the other head sweeps out of the smoke
hiccup hurls his water with all his might
it arcs and drops short of the dragons sparking mouth
the dragon grins savoring the kill
oh come on
gobber covers his eyes
the zippleback hesitates
the teens get to their feet watching transfixed
gobber peeks through his fingers to see
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
the zippleback backing away from hiccup
he stands and holds his hands out as if controlling it
now dont you make me tell you again
the zippleback retreats through its door and into its cave hissing
yes thats right
back into your cage
hiccup slyly opens his vest revealing the spotted smoked eel from earlier
he tosses it inside the door then slams it shut
now think about what youve done
hiccup turns to the teens and gobber
they stare slack jawed okay
so are we done
because ive got some things i need to
hiccup jogs out of the ring past the speechless group
see you tomorrow
somethings going on
hiccup cuts and stitches leather draws and shapes steel
he works by candlelight
an overhead shot reveals what hes building a harness complete with handles and foot pedals
hiccup appears before toothless holding the new prosthetic
toothless runs off as hiccup chases him down
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
toothless and hiccup are zooming over the ocean
the tail breaks free sending hiccup flying
hiccup adjusts the harness and uses a metal clamp to affix himself to toothless saddle
hiccup and toothless zip through the air his rudimentary harness and tail controls are working barely
they crash land in an open field
hiccup recovers to find toothless still rolling around in the tall grass
hiccup discovers that its a patch of a dragon nip
toothless writhes on his back tongue wagging in complete bliss
hiccup grabs the head as instructed then discreetly pulls a fistful of a dragon nip and presses it up to the gronkles nose
it immediately stops struggling and goes weak in the knees
hiccup drops the handful of dragon nip to the ground
the gronkle goes down with it whimpering and blissful
from gobber and the recruits point of view hiccup is controlling the gronkle with no more than a limp arm
the recruits walk home together surrounding hiccup and hey hiccup ive never seen a gronkle to that before
howd you do that
it was really cool
he squirms and invents an excuse
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
i left my axe back in the ring
he turns and hurries back
you guys go on ahead and ill catch up with you
astrid watches suspicious
hiccup rubs toothless behind the ear causing him to relax and fall over
an angry deadly nadder approaches hiccup
just as astrid moves in to strike hiccup performs his special rubbing technique which sends the nadder down
astrid and the other kids look on from the sideline in amazement
hiccup sits down at a table to eat
the other recruits notice him and move over to his table to talk to him leaving astrid alone
what was that
some kind of trick
what did you do
hiccup youre totally going to come in first theres no question
hiccup is using a mirror like object to create a patch of light on the ground
toothless claws and chases the light patch like a cat chasing a laser pointer
a beam lifts from the door of another dragon pen
meet the terrible terror
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
a tiny pint sized dragon steps out and moves toward the recruits
its like the size of my tuffnut is taken down in a blur
get it off
get it off
im hurt i am very much hurt
hiccup stops the terrible terror with the same light patch trick he used earlier with toothless
the tiny dragon retreats back to its cage
the teens approach him yet again as astrid looks on with suspicion
wow hes better than you ever were
astrid furiously hurls her axe at a nearby tree
she notices hiccup walking by in the distance carrying one of his trademark harnesses
she quickly tries to follow but he loses her in the woods
she huffs frustrated
hiccup straps a newly designed harness onto toothless
with toothless tied to a nearby post with a rope
hiccup rides him in the air while stationary
toothless looks like a giant kite tied to a tree stump
this harness seems to work
the rope breaks and the pair crash into a tree
hiccups face is red
the streets are empty save for a lone viking who crosses hiccups path
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
hiccup nods trying to look casual
once the coast is clear he covertly steers toothless into the blacksmiths stall
toothless presses himself inside rooting through stuff and making a racket
astrid walking nearby is alerted
then frantically tries to pry the ring off the saddle hook
it wont budge
are you in there
too late shes right outside
on astrid walking along the outside of the blacksmiths
hiccup jumps out the window and closes the shutters behind him
hiccups harness line is stretched through the window still attached to toothless saddle
i normally dont care what people do but youre acting weird
toothless spots a nearby sheep and makes a move toward it
as a result hiccup is suddenly pulled tight against the window shutters
he strikes a pose to compensate
then gets pulled through the shutters
they snap back in astrids face
astrid reopens them and finds nothing but an empty stall
in the distance toothless and hiccup slip off unseen
a lone battered ship is pulled into a slip overloaded with equally battered looking men
they disembark to a crowd of onlookers looking like a team of hometown heroes who just had their butts kicked
gobber hobbles through the mumbling crowd to find stoick last to disembark and glowering with battered pride
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
where are the other ships
you dont want to know
stoick lumbers past gobber leaving him staring at the trashed ship
well i trust you found the nest at least
not even close
gobber follows stoick up the ramp and snags his duffle bag with his hook appendage sharing the burden
i hope you had a little more success than me
well if by success you mean that your parenting troubles are over with then
what does that mean
a group of merry villagers rush past
everyone is so relieved
out with the old and in with the new right
no one will miss that old nuisance
the village is throwing a party to celebrate
stoick is stunned overwhelmed by the insensitivity
he turns to gobber
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
but who can blame him
i mean the life of a celebrity is very rough
he can barely walk through the village without being swarmed by his new fans
stoick is doubly confused
who wouldve thought eh
he has this
way with the beasts
toothless and hiccup soar through a perfect blue sky
billowing clouds rise like mountains
the ground seems miles below them
okay there bud were gonna take this nice and slow
hiccup checks a leather cheat sheet clipped onto his harness
inscribed upon it are several tail positions and their pedal position equivalents
here we go
here we go
position three no four
he presses the pedal causing the tail to flare
they roll off into an arcing bank gloriously lit by the late afternoon sun
hiccup tucks tight against his neck thrilled that his new harness and vest are holding
the foot controls make the tail appendage quick and responsive
he watches toothless every fluctuation trying to match it with the prosthetic
hiccup sizes up a target a towering arch of stone rising from the sea
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
alright its go time
its go time
they dive toward it lining up to pass through the arch
come on buddy
come on buddy
they zip through the arch
a perfect maneuver
yes it worked
the triumph is short lived
they smack into one of several sea stacks as hiccup tries to keep up with the turns
they hurtle into another rock pillar
toothless swats him with his ear plate
yeah yeah im on it
referring to the cheat position four no three
they pierce the clouds
for the first time hiccup can see the whole of the island below them
it shrinks with every passing second
he swallows hard and tightens his grip on the handles
oh this is amazing
the wind in my
he spots the leather guide tearing free in the turbulence
hiccup grabs frantically for the airborne sheet
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
and nabs it before its carried out of reach
toothless however obeys the command and suddenly stops beating his wings
as they slow to a stop hiccup goes weightless
the rings of his vest float off of the harness hooks
hiccup suddenly finds himself detached free falling
without hiccup the tail loses control
hiccup and toothless spiral downward
toothless fights to get back under hiccup
trying to calm toothless alright okay
you just gotta kinda angle yourself
come back down towards me
come back down hiccup extends his arms and legs giving himself as much surface area as he can
he angles back towards toothless as the tumbling dragon whacks hiccup with his wing
after a few more misses hiccup finally grabs hold of the harness and manages to lock in just in time to pull toothless out of his dive
barely shy of the tree tops
they careen past the wooded cliff and directly into a treacherous slalom course of jutting sea stacks
hiccup pulls the cheat sheet from his teeth and attempts to check positions
it flaps violently in the turbulence making it impossible
with no time to think hiccup throws it away and steers toothless tail on instinct
with perfect intuition
together they manage a tight hair rasing series of split second turns making it to the open water unscathed
hiccup takes a breath and glances back at the death defying obstacle course now safely behind them
he beams relieved
he sits back and throws his arms up in victory
toothless concurs with a happy squeal and a fireball
hiccups glee turn to dread as they fly directly into it
ah come on
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
hiccup and toothless lounge on a sprawling deserted beach snacking of freshly caught fish
as hiccup cooks his over a fire toothless suddenly regurgitates a fish head
hiccup smirks with forced politeness
gesturing to his fish on im good
several terrible terrors land like seagulls hissing and nipping at each other as they approach toothless pile of fish
one grabs the regurgitated fish head and drags it away
another attempts to steal it from him
they face off and last fire balls at each other to settle the fight
hiccup and toothless watch amused
that is until
toothless spots one of his fish leaving the pile
a stealthy terrible terror is exposed as the thief
they tug on the fish and it snaps back into toothless mouth
he swallows it back tauntingly
irate the little dragon paws at the ground and blast toothless
he opens his mouth the gas hiss comes and toothless fires a tiny flame straight into its mouth causing the gas to backfire into the little dragon
it coughs up smoke and staggers away looking ill
not so fireproof on the inside are you
hiccup throws the hapless terror his freshly cooked fish
here you go
the appreciative little dragon gulps down the meal and approaches hiccup cautiously
he curls up next to him
hiccup is amazed
everything we know about you guys is wrong
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
hiccup carefully pets him
sending the terror into an immediate blissful sleep
hiccup is lost in thought his head laid of a desk full of toothless drawings
burdened with the weight of the world
suddenly stoick appears in the doorway
hiccup jumps and quickly covers up his desk
he skirts the bench blocking stoicks view of toothless the prosthetic fin and other drawings
gobbers not here so
he strikes an awkwardly casual pose trying to cover up as much as possible
i came looking for you
youve been keeping secrets
hiccups legs give out
he slides dragging the tables contents with him
just how long did you think you could hide it from me
i dont know what youre
nothing happens on this island without me hearing about it
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
lets talk about that dragon
blood drains from hiccups face
dad im so sorry
i was going to tell you
i just didnt know how to stoick starts laughing
hiccup stares baffled
i was hoping for this
and believe me it only gets better
just wait til you spill a nadders guts for the first time
hiccups elated expression sinks
and mount your first gronckle head on a spear
what a feeling
stoick laughs and smacks hiccup on the shoulder sending him into the wall
you really had me going there son
all those years of the worst viking berk has ever seen
odin it was rough
i almost gave up on you
hiccup gets back up grimacing in the irony of it all
and all the while you were holding out on me
stoick grabs a stool and sits
his massive frame nearly fills the tiny room
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
with you doing so well in the ring we finally have something to talk about
hiccup averts his eyes nervously
stoick adjusts awkwardly clearing his throat
after a long uncomfortable silence
brought you something
he presents a horned helmet
to keep you safe in the ring
hiccup accepts it looking it over
your mother wouldve wanted you to have it
its half of her breast plate
stoick taps his own helmet and smiles
keeps her close yknow
hiccup eyes the mismatched helmets grimacing
wear it proudly
you deserve it
youve held up your end of the deal
stoick beams with pride
he forces a yawn
i should really get to bed
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
talking over each talking over each yes
see you back at the house
we should do this again
thanks for stopping glad i stopped by i hope you by
and for the
the uh like the hat
stoick leaves the room awkwardly leaving hiccup looking more burdened than ever
a gronckle hovers above the ring hunting victims as the teen recruits scramble
astrid ducks behind a barrier to find hiccup already there
she forces her axe at his throat
stay out of my way
im winning this thing
please by all means
she darts off closing fast on the dragon
the crowd above cheers her on
you got it astrid
hiccup stands and looks around
amidst the crowd of onlookers stoick watches keenly beaming with pride
he locks eyes with hiccup giving him a nod of encouragement
hiccup adjusts his new helmet and forces a half hearted smile
unbeknownst to hiccup the gronckle spots him and makes a bee line toward him
as she catches her breath behind a barrier
she scowls focused determined
this time for sure
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
with a fierce battle cry she leaps from cover axe cocked to throw
and as she clears the barriers she sees that hiccup has already laid the gronckle out
hiccup shrugs as unhappy with the situation as she is
a loud clack ring out
from the crowd above gothi the village elder steps forward tapping her staff
everyone lights up excitedly
gobber snags hiccup as he attempts to leave
not so fast
im kinda late for what
late for what exactly
stoick holds out his hands to silence the jabbering crowd
okay quiet down
the elder has decided
thrilled gobber stands behind hiccup and astrid
he points to astrid as the crowd waits in silent anticipation
gothi shakes her head no
the crowd oooohs
gobber then points to hiccup
the elder nods an affirmative yes
the crowd erupts in cheers
astrid turns a seething deadly glare on hiccup
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
youve done it
youve done it hiccup
you get to kill the dragon
thats my boy
hiccup is hoisted onto the recruits shoulders and carried out to the cheering spectators
i cant wait
i am so
lets pack up
looks like you and me are taking a little vacation forever
toothless is nowhere in sight
hiccup sets down his basket and opens it up his head clouded with troubles
hiccup looks up to the sound of
astrid sitting on the rock right in front of him sharpening her axe
what the what are you doing here
she hops off the rock and back him down spinning her axe threateningly
hiccups eyes dart around nervously searching for toothless
i want to know whats going on
no one just gets as good as you do
are you training with someone
she grabs him by his odd looking harness
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
it better not involve
i know this looks really bad but you see
this is uh
they hear a rustle coming from the other side of the cove
astrid drops hiccup to the ground and sets off to investigate
im through with the lies
ive been making
so you got me
its time everyone knew
drag me back
here we go
he puts her hand back on his harness getting her to drag him back
astrid bends hiccups hand backwards driving him down
why would you do that
thats for the lies
astrid pounces the hilt of her axe off of hiccups laid out body
and thats for everything else
hiccups yelp is answered with a growl coming from the other side of the cove
astrid looks up to see
a night fury
toothless pounces toward them snarling
she dives onto hiccup
astrid pulls her axe ready to take on toothless
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
hiccup knocks astrids cocked axe to the ground out of reach then stops toothless short of crushing her
toothless pulls up short and lands hard spraying astrid with sand
shes a friend
toothless snorts in disagreement
astrid is frozen
toothless looks from her to hiccup and back to her confused
you just scared him
i scared him
hiccup makes a abe quieta motion
who is him
astrid backs away eyeing hiccup and toothless together with pure disgust
she turns and runs for the village
satisfied with astrids departure toothless turns away
where do you think youre going
astrid races through the trees
a large shadow overtakes her
she is suddenly snatched into the air
oh great odins ghost this is it
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
hiccup and toothless fly astrid to the top of a towering pine
it bows and creaks under their weight as astrid dangles a hundred feet in the air
get me down from here
you have to give me a chance to explain
im not listening to anything you have to say
then i wont speak
just let me show you
hiccup extends a hand
she eyes him and the dragon then the ground far far below
after a moment she swats hiccups outstretched hand away and reluctantly climbs over the pedal lines and harness
she settles behind hiccup avoiding as much contact as possible
now get me down
toothless leers mischievously
he spreads his wings slowly
with a whop they fill with the updraft
toothless releases the tree tucks in his legs and hovers in place
nothing to be afraid of
toothless suddenly launches straight upward
the acceleration is tremendous
every downbeat bucks the saddle heaving them into the sky doubling their speed like a rocket
astrid is thrown backward
she screams and hugs hiccup for dear life squeezing the breath out of him
what is wrong with you
mortified to astrid hes not usually like this
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
toothless rolls and plummets toward the coastline far below
toothless rockets over the ocean waves deliberately dipping them in the froth
toothless what are you doing
we need her to like us
toothless rockets skyward and begins tumbling head over tail
and now the spinning
thank you for nothing you useless reptile
astrid clamps her hand over her eyes
just get me off of this thing
astrid is defeated her aggressive energy gone
satisfied toothless relents
they level off and head up into the clouds
astrid opens her eyes again and looks out over a world shed never dreamed of
she reaches out and touches clouds pierces columns ablaze in golden hues and floats over a vast alien sky scape
her terror is replaced by wonder
she grins despite herself
toothless rises above a blanket of clouds
and levels off under a starry sky
they emerge from a blanket of clouds under the dancing northern lights shimmering in ribbons across the vast sky
below them berks torches flicker in the inky darkness
the new perspective is breathtaking
astrid tucks her arms into hiccups vest burying her chin into his shoulder
the moment is not lost on either of them
hiccup smiles nervously
toothless climbs past berks tallest peaks and heads out over open water leaving the village lights behind them
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
alright i admit it
this is pretty cool
astrid carefully reaches down and pats toothless side
so what now
its a problem without an answer
hiccup your final exam is tomorrow
you know youre going to have to kill
kill a dragon
dont remind me
a strange unearthly din approaches
toothless ear plates suddenly stand on end
panicked he abruptly dives dipping into cloud cover
what is it
toothless barks at him
suddenly out of the dense cloud a monstrous nightmare emerges
hiccup and astrid duck
the nightmare calls out
a zippleback appears to the other side of toothless boxing him in
whats going on
i dont know
youve got to get us out of here bud
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
other dragons previously invisible in the thick clouds appear all around them
hundreds of them all carrying fish and game in their talons
it looks like theyre hauling in their kill
the zippleback eyes them ravenously
what does that make us
the dragons bank and dive in formation plummeting through the thickening fog and weaving between towering craggy sea stacks
they emerge at the base of a massive volcanic caldera glowing with rivulets of lava
the flock of dragons fall into rank funneling through a crack and zipping through a winding tunnel
it gives way to a vast steamy inner chamber tiered with pocky shelves
dragons of all breeds lay about nested in hordes
the arriving dragons fly in dropping the fish and game into a central pit glowing red and shrouded in mist
hiccup is amazed
what my dad wouldnt give to find this
toothless peels away from the procession landing on a small shadowy shelf to keep a low profile
hiccup and astrid peek around taking in the busy hive of sorts
they watch as the food continues to be dropped into the pit
its satisfying to know that all of our food has been dumped down a hole
theyre not eating any of it
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
last to arrive is a dim witted gronckle
it hovers over the pit and regurgitates his paltry contribution a pathetic little fish
as it falls into the steamy pit a terrible roar rings out
the gronckle tries to flee but before it can a gargantuan dragon head juts from the steamy pit and snaps it out of the air
swallowing it back whole
hiccup and astrid recoil terrified
what is that
the monstrous beast sniffs the air seemingly aware of them
it nears the ledge where toothless is hiding
several dragons take flight in fear
alright buddy we gotta get out of here
toothless takes flight barely evading the monsters snapping jaws
the behemoth dragon lunges for them snatching a zippleback out of the air instead
toothless disappears into the winged exodus as thousands of dragons flee the caldera in fear
toothless glides into the cove and touches down on the moonlit beach
her mind reeling talking hiccups ear off no no it totally makes sense
its like a giant beehive
theyre the workers
and thats their queen
it controls them
she leaps off of toothless and runs toward the village
lets find your dad
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
astrid we have to think this through carefully
astrid eyes him incredulous
hiccup we just discovered the dragons nest
the thing weve been after since vikings first sailed here
and you want to keep it a secret
to protect your pet dragon
are you serious
hiccup stands firm resolute
astrids taken aback
then what do we do
just give me until tomorrow
ill figure something out
astrid punches hiccup in the arm
thats for kidnapping me
hiccup looks to toothless for support
toothless snorts dismissive
astrid grabs him
he braces for another hit
she kisses hiccup on the cheek
thats for everything else
in the awkward wake of the moment astrid hurries off
leaving hiccup rubbing his cheek stunned
toothless hobbles up eyeing him
what are you looking at
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
the grounds have been transformed
banners and flags flap in the morning sun
surrounding the ring a festive crowd had gathered
all of berk has turned out for the event
aloud to the crowd well i can show my face in public again
if someone had told me that in a few short weeks hiccup would go from being well
hiccup to placing first in dragon training
i wouldve tied him to a mast and shipped him off for fear hed gone mad
and you know it
but here we are
and no ones more surprised
on hiccup standing at the entrance to the ring listening looking burdened
or more proud than i am
today my boy becomes a viking
today he cheers and roars
astrid approaches hiccup
be careful with that dragon
re the roaring crowd its not the dragon im worried about
what are you going to do
put an end to this
she eyes him dubious
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
i have to try
if something goes wrong
just make sure they dont find toothless
just promise me it wont go wrong
its time hiccup
knock him dead
hiccup puts his helmet on and enters the ring
hooting and hollering from the stands
show em how its done my man
hiccup locks eyes with stoick
stoick nods with a smile
hiccup returns a half smile
takes a deep breath
he hoists a shield onto his forearm and selects his weapon from a rack of many a small dagger
i wouldve gone for the hammer
hiccup turns to face a bolted heavy door
takes a deep breath
the door bolt is raised
the crowd grows quiet
the doors blast open with a stream of sticky fire
followed by a monstrous nightmare coated in flames
it tears out of its cave like an irate bull as the crowd roars and jeers
it climbs the walls and chain enclosure like a bat hissing at the provoking crowd and blasting fire
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
it spots hiccup and descends leering and licking the flaming drool from its lips
the crowd grows silent bracing for the big fight
with the monstrous nightmares eyes locked upon him hiccup deliberately drops his shield and dagger stepping away from them
the dragon pauses confused
on stoick also confused
what is he doing
the dragon presses closer snorting
hiccup extends his open hand
the dragon continues to pace focused on
hiccup realizes then reaches up and removes it
taking a breath to acknowledge the point of no return he tosses the helmet aside
it hits the ground
im not one of them
gasps and murmurs race through the crowd
on stoick as all eyes turn to him
hes welling with upset
hiccup avoids stoicks glare and remains focused on the nightmare holding his hand out
it paces around him calming down
stop the fight
i need you all to see this
the crowd gets restless
theyre not what we think they are
we dont have to kill them
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
stoick whacks his hammer against the iron enclosure rattling the arena with a terrible reverberating clatter
spooked the nightmare snaps at hiccups outstretched hand
hiccup yelps and springs backward
the spell is broken
the nightmare reacts to hiccups sudden movements and blasts another stream of fire
hiccup screams and barely dives out of reach
his ear plates shoot up
panic flares in his eyes
hiccup scrambles around the ring
the nightmare pursues snapping and springing from ground to wall
stoick pushes through the crowd rushing to the doorway
out of my way
astrid wedges her axe under the arena gate and squeezes through
toothless bounds to the cove walls clawing them in desperation
it seems hes as trapped as before but with an incredible burst of effort he hooks a claw over the upper lip of the stone wall
a narrow stream of fire narrowly avoids hiccup as he continues to dash around the ring evading the monstrous nightmare
desperate he goes to the weapon rack in an attempt to arm himself but the nightmare quickly destroys the rack and closes in on him
toothless tears through the woods bounding like panther and taking to the air in short bursts
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
stoick wrenches the grated door to the arena and jumps through
the monstrous nightmare is only a few feet behind hiccup
astrid is now in the ring
she picks up a hammer and hurls it at the monstrous nightmare hitting it in the head
it turns its attention to astrid and begins chasing her
stoick raises the arena gate waving her toward it
astrid makes it through but the nightmare blasts the doorway cutting hiccup off
it pounces on him and prepares to finish him off
suddenly a terrible roar pierces the din
toothless bounds over the crowd and blasts a hole through the chain enclosure
he flies through it and disappears in the boiling smoke
the vikings rush to railings
in time to see a flurry of wings cutting through the dissipating smoke
toothless and the nightmare tumble into the clear locked in a toothy vicious fight
toothless kicks the nightmare off and plants himself between hiccup and it
the nightmare snarls circling them
toothless lunges and roars
causing the nightmare to relent and back away
to everyones shock and horror hiccup gets to his feet and grabs toothless protectively
alright toothless go
get out of here
the crowd is gob smacked growing livid
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
hiccup tries to shoo toothless away in vain
vikings begin pouring clambering through the enclosure and dropping into the ring
take it alive
stoick grabs an axe and charges into the arena
astrid calls out to him panicked
he wont hurt you
the other vikings surround and attack toothless
he tosses them aside like rag dolls his eyes focused on stoick
youre only making it worse
stoick raises his hammer as he charges for toothless
toothless ducks and pounces on him
they tumble end over end
he pins stoick and inhales
the familiar hiss of gas builds
toothless swallows back the blast and turns to hiccup not understanding
the crowd rushes him piling on and taking toothless down
astrid holds hiccup back
just dont hurt him
please dont hurt him
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
stoick gets to his feet fuming shaken
a viking presents stoick with an axe
he eyes toothless a moment then pushes the axe back into the vikings hands
put it with the others
his burning glare turn to hiccup
being shoved into the dank dimmed hall
the massive doors rattle and echo
stoick pushes past him
he paces against a backdrop of shadowy tapestries and carved pillars a legacy of heroes all peering down in angered judgement
i should have known
i should have seen the signs
we had a deal
stoick pauses to say something but stops short
he snorts and resumes pacing repeating the cycle
i know we did
but that was before
ughh its all so messed up
so everything in the ring
he stomps toward hiccup
stops short and points fighting back words
i screwed up
i should have told you before now
take this out on me be mad at me but please
just dont hurt toothless
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
thats what youre worried about
not the people you almost killed
he was just protecting me
hes not dangerous
theyve killed hundreds of us
and weve killed thousands of them
they defend themselves thats all
they raid us because they have to
if they dont bring enough food back theyll be eaten themselves
theres something else on their island dad
its a dragon like stoick huffs
he stomps back
pointing an accusing finger
so youve been to the nest
did i say nest
hiccup goes silent he said too much
how did you find it
only a dragon can find the island
a moment passes then an idea takes form on his face
his eyes flare
hiccup watches realizing
stoick stomps toward the doorway
hiccup chases after him panicked
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
its not what you think
you dont know what youre up against
its like nothing youve ever seen
he grabs stoick by the arm tugging with all his might
he has no effect whatsoever
i promise you that you cant win this one
for once in your life he throws hiccup off of him swatting him to the floor
hiccup stares back stunned
youve thrown your lot in with them
youre not a viking
youre not my son
stoick pushes through the door leaving hiccup alone devastated
ready the ships
stoick staggers on the steps breaking inside
broken down catapults and trebuchets are bundled up and lowered from the cliffs
below on the docks vikings load the heavy artillery into the hulls of awaiting ships
children and the elderly gather to on the walkways to wave apprehensive farewells to the departing warriors
lastly toothless is loaded aboard stoicks ship chained down to a palette muzzled and restrained with a weighty neck ring
he looks exhausted miserable
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
stoick crosses to the bow as the ship pushes off and joins the amassed armada of ships adrift in the harbor
stoicks brow is furrowed all warmth drained away
he turns west and glares at the horizon with cold determination
we head for helheims gate
he then notices hiccup watching from his familiar cliff side perch beyond the village
their eyes meet full of hurt and regret
hiccup slowly shakes his head in warning
stoick breaks the stare and turns to toothless fuming
lead us home devil
hes powerless to stop what is happening but wont leave
still standing there
the ships have cleared the horizon
crane up to reveal astrid is standing behind him
she approaches cautiously and stands beside him in silence
its a mess
hiccup doesnt respond
you must feel horrible
youve lost everything
your father your tribe your best friend
thank you for summing that up
why couldnt i have killed that dragon when i found him in the woods
it would have been better for everyone
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
the rest of us would have done it
so why didnt you
hiccup just shakes his head he really doesnt know
astrids eyes glimmer
she wants something
why didnt you
i dont know
thats not an answer
why is this so important to you all of a sudden
because i want to remember what you say right now
angry loud oh for the love of i was a coward
i was weak
i wouldnt kill a dragon
you said wouldnt that time
three hundred years and im the first viking who wouldnt kill a dragon
first to ride one though
he never looked at it that way before
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
i wouldnt kill him because he looked as frightened as i was
i looked at him and i saw myself
astrid turns to face the open sea
i bet hes really frightened now
what are you going to do about it
probably something stupid
but youve already done that
then something crazy
thats more like it
the armada coasts toward a shroud of heavy fog hung like drapes from a low hanging ominous sky
the ships enter one by one
visibility drops immediately
flanking ships becomes ghosts
the armada disappears drawn into the blinding mist
nothing remains but the eerie creaking of wood on water
on stoick at the bow of his ship
he taps his fingers on the gunwale then looks back at toothless impatiently
weighed down with chains toothless seems unresponsive
sound your positions
stay within earshot
shouts pour in from all directions
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
one length to your stern
on your starboard flank
three widths to port
ahead at your bow
havent a clue
on stoick straining into the fog as the calls continue
massive jagged sea stacks begin to emerge threatening to rip the ships to shreds
gobber approaches him speaking under his breath
i was overhearing some of the men just now and well some of them are wondering what it is were up to here not me of course i know youre
always the man with the plan but some not me are wondering if there is in fact a plan at all what it might be
find the nest and take it
send them running
the old viking fall back
nice and simple
stoick notices that toothless ear plates are at the alert quietly reacting to inaudible sounds
stoick crosses to the stern of the ship and grabs the tiller moving the helmsman out of the way
stoick pulls the ship into a turn covertly following toothless head movements
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
the ship barely misses a jagged outcrop that suddenly appears out of the soupy fog
bear to port
the order is called out from ship to ship
the bow barely makes it past another sea stack
stoick continues to follow toothless cues undeterred
hiccup raises the bolt on the monstrous nightmares pen
if youre planning on getting eaten id definitely go with the gronckle
hiccup turns to see his fellow recruits watching him with folded arms
tuffnut steps forward with a scowl
you were wise to seek help from the worlds most deadly weapon
i love this plan
i like that
what is the plan
hiccup smiles glowing in the support of his friends
the ships follow in line through the gauntlet of rocks as orders are whispered from ship to ship
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
a dragon head looms out of the fog
the men recoil
only to discover that its a wrecked ship impaled high on a gnarled sea stack
i was wondering where that went
a clicking buzz becomes audible growing louder
it fills the sky converging in one general direction
stoick sniffs the air
stay low and ready your weapons
stoicks ship suddenly jerks to a halt as the keel burrows into shallow black sand
stoick hops overboard landing on a sprawling beach
the buzzing suddenly stops
above him a craggy volcano towers into the gloom
behind him several dragon headed bows pierce the fog
hiccup steps back from the door drawing the monstrous nightmare out of its cave
it snorts stepping into the ring calmed by hiccups outstretched hand focused on him
on the teens
bewildered in awe
snotlout nervously reaches for a spear laying near his foot
astrid stops him
hiccup slows to a stop in front of the teens with the nightmare inches from his outstretched hand
he reaches over and grabs snotlouts trembling hand
what are you
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
hiccup replaces his outstretched hand with snotlouts putting him in control of the massive beast
the nightmare snorts but remains calm
snotlout by contrast chuckles nervously its at once terrifying and amazing
the others watch spellbound
hiccup turns and walks away
where are you going
hiccup pulls a bundle of rope from a supply box
youre going to need something to help you hold on
the teens eye each other apprehensively and look up to reveal
all the dragons standing in the ring facing the teens expectantly
tree trunks being sharpened and planted into the sand at angled rows
boulders being loaded into catapult baskets
and a war plan being scratched in the sand
stoick looms over it looking determined
his generals are at his sides
when we crack this mountain open all hell is going to break loose
in my undies
good thing i brought extras
stoick turns to face the men
no matter how this ends it ends today
he walks toward the base of the volcano wall back by several hundred warriors
he raises his arm and drops it
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
a line of catapults unleash their two ton loads into the cliff wall
it cracks and flakes away
several more hits tear away at the hollow shell of hardened lava
a final boulder shatters the fractured wall creating a deep dark opening to the cavern within
stock raises his hand makes a gesture
a flaming bushel is launched into the dark lighting the wall
choked stoick pulls his hammer and rushes into the cave brazen
war cries and slashing efforts in a chaotic flurry the dragons suddenly rush out like bats from a cave
the take to the air bypassing the axe swinging vikings and fleeing the island in a mass exodus
the battle ready vikings drop their weapons confused
is that it
above the island dragons pour from every crevice fleeing to the sky
the sound of screeching dragons fades
cheering as one weve done it
stoick doesnt celebrate
something is not right
he hears something
stoick turns to peer down the dark throat of the cavern
a deep rumbling roar echoes from the cavern
the ground underfoot trembles
the ships rock
their sails fill with a blast of air
the cheering stops
stoicks expression sinks
this isnt over
form your ranks
the men scramble to organize themselves
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
the ground cracks
stone tears away cascading like an avalanche
and through the settling debris the silhouette of a gargantuan dragon emerges the red death
stirred and furious
beard of thor
what is that
odin help us
the vikings score direct hits
the burning stones bounce off the dragons skin
the red death focuses on the catapults
it crushes the first one smashing it and its crew rattling the beach underfoot
stoick races toward the second catapult
he leaps and pushes a viking out of the way just before the dragon crushes him under his forepaw
the vikings scramble in all directions
get to the ships
the red death blasts the ships like a mile long flamethrower
the sails are torched
vikings dive overboard and masts come down
gobber joins stoick
smart that one
stoick looks up and down the beach for an answer
i was a fool
the monster raises its head to the sky and bellows
the sound shakes the beach knocking vikings off their feet
this island is his
stoick stops a viking general
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
lead the men to the far side of the island
turns to the others everybody to the far side of the island
the vikings scatter into the rocks like ants
satisfied with the ships destruction the red death turns its attention back to the vikings
they seem to have vanished
it sniffs the air searching for their scent
gobber drops in beside stoick like two soldiers in a trench
fire blasts over head causing them to duck
gobber go with the men
i think ill stay just in case youre thinking of doing something crazy
stoick grabs him
i can buy them a few minutes if i give that thing someone to hunt
gobber removes stoicks hand
clenches his forearm determined
then i can double that time
friends to the bitter end
they break cover and dash into the open splitting up
stoick rips a sharpened post from the ground and hurls it into the monsters face
it spots both of them
he fuels up to fire glancing back and forth between the two men
he focuses on stoick
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
the red death remains focused on stoick this is it
it rears back and inhales
gas begins to amass when
a blast explodes against the back of the red deaths head
it turns distracted as
a nadder punches through the flames banking across the sky
followed by a monstrous nightmare a zippleback and a gronckle
they roll in unison revealing the recruits riding on their backs
hiccup leads with astrid clinging to his waist
gobber and stoick watch slack jawed in awe
ruff tuff watch your backs
the monster shakes off the blast and snaps in their wake
hiccup directs his squadron out of harms way
they climb out of reach and circle each other
look at us were on a dragon
were on dragons all of us
up lets move it
the dragons climb past the red death
gobber hobbles over to stoick
every bit the boar headed stubborn viking you ever were
stoick is speechless
the group circles over the dragons head
fishlegs break it down
heavily armored skull and tail made for bashing and crushing
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
steer clear of both
small eyes large nostrils
relies on hearing and smell
lout legs hang in its blind spot
make some noise keep it confused
ruff tuff find out if it has a shot limit
make it mad
thats my specialty
everyone knows im more irritating
just do what i told you
ill be back as soon as i can
dont worry we got it covered
hiccup and astrid peel away
the teens bank and dive toward the monster splitting up
the twins race alongside the monsters head taunting it
bride of grendel
the red death unloads a spray of fire at the twins
they barely dodge it
fishlegs and snotlout hang behind its eyes banging away at their shields making a racket
the red death opens all six of its eyes spotting them
uh this thing doesnt have a blind spot
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
searching for toothless
hiccup spots him among the burning ships
he steers the nadder over the deck and hands astrid the reins
he lines up his jump
and hops off guarding his face from the flames
he lands on the burning deck
go help the others
she and the nadder take off
as hiccup fights his way to toothless
he unbuckles the muzzle
okay hold on
he gets to work on the chains
they clang their weapons against their shields making the monster wince
the huge beast starts to sway its head dizzily
pan down to reveal that the noise is also confusing the gronckle and the monstrous nightmare
both dragons lose their bearings
the red death thrashes knocking snotlout off of his dragon and onto the monsters gigantic head
snotlout bounces across the top and comes to a stop just shy of the hundred foot drop
fishlegs gronckle goes down in a spin of confusion
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
ive lost power on the gronckle
he hurls snotlout his hammer
the gronkle crashes and skids to a stop
then flips over crushing fishlegs
who eyes the red deaths gigantic veiny eyes
he raises the hammer
i cant miss
and hammers the monsters eyes playing whack a mole
whats wrong buddy got something in your eye
astrid flies by on her nadder catching snotlout in all his heroics
youre the viking
snotlout grins finally vindicated in her eyes
in his distraction he gets thrown and lands heavily on one of the red deaths spines clinging precariously
a close call
the monsters tail sweeps across the burning ships snapping masts like twigs
we follow one down as it crashes onto a deck revealing
working at the chains
he cant budge them
fire licks at his clothes
he looks up to see
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
the red death blasting at the teens enraged
the monsters giant foot crashes through frame smashing the bow under its impressive weight
hiccup and toothless are thrown into the water in a maelstrom of burning planks and rigging
hiccup swims toward toothless
theyre both caught in a mess of rigging being dragged down
the heavy palette settles into the rocky bottom like an anchor
toothless has stopped struggling
hiccup takes one more hopeless tug at the chains hes almost out of air
suddenly a meaty hand grabs hiccup
stoick explodes to the surface pulling hiccup to the shoreline through flaming debris
he lays him down under the shelter of an overhanging rock
stoick dives back into the water between flaming flotsam
on toothless drowning
stoick appears in front of him
stoick tears the chains off of the yoke and lets it float free
they eye each other through the churned up bubbles
toothless lunges out of the bars grabbing stoick
in an explosion of sea water toothless lands on the shore setting stoick down and releasing him
hiccup is awed
the ground rumbles underfoot
the monster screeches
its massive claws stomp around in the smoke
stoick gives way as toothless mounts the rock and raises his wings
he turns to hiccup and snorts a lets go
you got it bud
hiccup climbs onto toothless and buckles himself in
stoick grabs his arm
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
you dont have to go up there
its an occupational hazard
they exchange smiles
im proud to call you my son
hiccup beams taken aback
stoick lets go of hiccups arm
hiccup spurs toothless on charged with his fathers belief in him
they rocket into the sky as stoick watches
astrid sees toothless streaking through the sky gaining altitude
she turns to ruffnut and tuffnut who are arguing and throwing punches at each other
get snotlout out of there
in mid punch the twins look over to see snotlout stranded on the monsters head
they eye each other
im on it
im on it
im on it first
im ahead of you
the twins spot snotlout on the giant dragon and steer their zippleback in his direction
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
let me drive
the twins peel off arguing as they race each other to the monster
snotlout sees the zippleback diving toward him and dashes down the red deaths head
he runs up the end of its horn
as the twins sweep past both missing him
but perfectly snatching him where the necks merge
ruff and tuff eye each other surprised and impressed
i cant believe that worked
the red death spots astrid and inhales preparing to blast
she and her nadder get caught in the suction pulled toward the monsters gaping mouth
the vikings watch with dread
they hear the familiar whir of the
a massive blast jolts the red deaths head sideways
astrid is thrown clear of its mouth
and her nadder
she tumbles through the air
the ground races toward her when
shes suddenly caught by the leg
she looks up to see toothless
did you get her
they fly over the crowd of vikings and set astrid down mid run
they circle back to reengage a black speck against the clouds
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
hiccup and toothless rocket past the red deaths head and climb higher and higher
that thing has wings
okay lets see if it can use them
hiccup pulls toothless into a turn
they plummet gaining tremendous speed
the wind buffets them as they target the red death as super sonic speed
toothless unloads a fireball against the red deaths head
it goes down with a rumble as they climb anew
the vikings shield themselves from the dust of the fallen monster
as its wings unfold and extend
hiccup looks back as they put distance between them
do you think that did it
suddenly the enraged behemoth rises into frame
flapping its wings furiously
a daunting sight
well he can fly
hiccup and toothless dive into the tangled sea stacks they weave through the rock like rabbits through a briar
the red death snaps at them but cannot reach them
hiccup and toothless pull ahead
the red death smashes through the canopy of rock and pulls in behind toothless
he bursts through fifty foot formations like they were saplings
stoick gobber and the teens watch as hiccup and toothless streak past weaving through sea stacks
a moment later the red death smashes the sea stacks to dust in hot pursuit
the vikings mood is quenched
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
hiccup and toothless cant slow the monster down
hiccup eyes the clouds above
an idea hits him
he locks eyes with toothless
okay toothless time to disappear
toothless pulls into a steep climb heading toward the clouds
come on bud
the red death follows closing in fast
hearing the gas here it comes
they narrowly dodge a column of flame and smoke
they reach the low hanging clouds and pierce them
the monster follows immediately losing them in the hampered visibility
it roars irritably
from out of nowhere toothless dives at the huge dragon blasting and puncturing a hole in its wing
toothless and hiccup are gone again before the dragon can get a shot at them
the vikings stare up at the sky listening to the resounding booms and watching flashes light up the clouds
gobber places a hand on stoicks shoulder
hiccup and toothless dive in again and again using the clouds to hide and surprise as they puncture the monsters wings
it bellows in frustration and whirls around unleashing fire blindly in all directions
hiccup sees the glow of fire cutting towards them
the random blast clips toothless tail
its heavily damaged
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
okay times up
lets see if this works
he pulls toothless into a turn
they fly directly into the red deaths face taunting it
is that the best you can do
toothless utters an insult too and they jackknife into a steep dive
the red death pursues
toothless pumps his wings racing faster than hes ever gone before
hiccup and toothless stay just ahead of the red death no longer trying to evade it
hiccup glances back to check the tail its disintegrating
stay with me buddy
just a little bit longer
the red death closes the gap
hiccup tucks in and holds toothless steady allowing the monster to set its sights on them
it narrows its eyes
the red death opens his mouth
the familiar gas hiss emanates from his throat ignition is coming
hiccup hits the pedals hard as toothless extends one wing
they pivot in place hurtling directly into the red deaths mouth
toothless fires point blank down the monsters throat
its amassing gas is ignited backfiring into the monster erupting in a chain of blasts throughout its body
hiccup and toothless burst from the clouds the red death hot on their tail exploding from within
it glances forward and sees the ground rushing up
it throws open its wings attempting to put on the brakes but the punctured damaged wings cant stop its momentum
as the red death chokes on the expanding fireball he sees toothless suddenly pull out of the dive streaking up past its head
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
the red death hits the ground head first
it explodes like the hindenburg
hiccup and toothless weave through the monsters massive back plates wings and flailing legs a high speed recall of the free fall slalom run
the expanding fireball races toward them about to swallow them
they manage to clear the obstacles
hiccup glances back
theyre outrunning the fireball
he looks forward just in time to see the monsters massive club tail careening toward them
he tries to shift their direction
the last shreds of toothless tail tear away
hiccups pedals go dead
hiccup and toothless cant maneuver theyre dead in the air
the giant club tail clips toothless tearing hiccup from the harness and sending him tumbling against the backdrop of the fast approaching fireball
toothless struggles with all his might to reach the unconscious hiccup
but the fireball swallows them both
the vikings watch in horror as hiccup and toothless disappear into the boiling inferno
a whiteout of ash
and through it comes
stoick appears searching desperately
everything is scorched
even the ground is smoking from the terrible heat
through the ash stoick the motionless silhouette of toothless
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
he hurries to the dragons side
toothless is roughed up but conscious
his scorched saddle however is vacant
stoick looks to the sky in despair
he buckles at the knees overwhelmed by the loss
i did this
astrid pushes through the crowd her eyes welling up
followed by gobber
they flank stoick as he kneels slumped over
behind them a ring of vikings form keeping a respectful distance
as the dust and smoke clear a ring of wild dragons can also be seen gathering just behind and between the vikings
toothless stirs and groggily rolls his head toward stoick
their eyes meet
im so sorry
toothless unfolds his wings revealing hiccup unconscious clutched safely against his chest
stoicks eyes widen
he scoops hiccup into his arms
listens to his heart
bursts into relieved laughter
you brought him back alive
the crowd roars
followed by the dragons
the vikings look around to find themselves surrounded
stoick leans close to toothless meeting him eye to eye
for saving my son
gobber looks hiccup up and down
well you know
most of him
stoick glances back at him
gobber shrugs redirecting his eyes toward
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
hiccup asleep his head on a pillow
healing scars on his face show that maybe a week or two have passed
toothless hovers over him whining and grumbling impatiently
opens his eyes
oh hey toothless
toothless excitedly nuzzles and nudges hiccup
im happy to see you too bud
now just toothless steps on his groin causing hiccup to sit bolt upright with a yelp
he looks around confounded
hes in his bed moved beside the fire pit on the main floor of his house
im in my house
re toothless leaning over him excited youre in my house
toothless tears around the room knocking things over far too big for the space
does my dad know youre in here
toothless pauses at the foot of the bed tongue wagging
he eyes the rafters
and leaps up onto them brimming with happy dog energy
okay okay no toothless
aw come on
hiccup shifts to get out of bed
sensing that something is wrong
he peels back the covers slowly
what he sees startles horrifies and overwhelms him all at once
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
his booted foot touches down
followed by a mechanical prosthetic in place of his second leg
its an ingenious spring loaded replacement made of wood and iron
toothless lands by the bed and approaches calmly sniffing the new leg
he raises his eyes to meet hiccups seemingly aware of what hiccup is going through
hiccup braces himself on the bedpost and tries to stand on it
he winces and stifles the pain
but stumbles with the first step
toothless catches hiccups fall with his head
and slowly lifts him up stabilizing him
hiccup leans on him like a crutch
they take a few steps together
their missing parts form a poetic silhouette as they make their way toward the door
hiccup pries it open as he did in the opening scene revealing a monstrous nightmare flapping outside the door
hiccup yelps and slams the door closed
he turns to toothless alarmed
stay here bud
and cracks the door open again
he peeks outside his eyes widening
he allows to door to swing open revealing
the monstrous nightmare carrying snotlout on its back
come on guys get ready
hold on tight
here we go
a class of newbie dragon riders follow him through frame on a variety of dragons pulling back the curtain on an amazing vista in which dragon deblois sanders final draft
vikings and dragons mill about by the dozen basking on the rooftops weaving along the plaza
no one seems upset there isnt a sword in sight
under the framework of a massive barn a nadder blasts fire onto a metal brace
it steps back to let a viking hammer it into shape
nearby a gronkle lands carrying a tree trunk in his mouth
he shows a viking what hes found
the viking pats his head
another viking backs a zippleback into a stall to check it for size
hiccup takes a step outside finding stoick waiting for him on the step
i knew it
no but you gave it your best shot
he puts his arm around hiccup steadying him
he gestures to the transformed village
what do you think
hiccup just shrugs amazed
below the plaza villagers take notice
they rush over surrounding him with a heros welcome
hiccup how you doin mate
its great to see you up and about
turns out all we needed was a little more of
you just gestured to all of me
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
most of you
gobber pushes through the crowd beaming proudly
re the prosthetic leg that bits my handiwork
with a little hiccup flare thrown in
think itll do
bittersweet coming to i might make a few tweaks
astrid appears and jabs hiccup in the arm
hiccup recoils with a grumble
thats for scaring me
what is it always going to be this way
she grabs him aggressively
then kisses him
hoots and hollers follow
could get used to it
gobber presents hiccup with a rebuilt saddle rigging and tail
suddenly toothless pounces on the crowd crushing several unsuspecting vikings under his weight
night fury get down
toothless eyes the new tail excitedly tongue wagging
amidst the groans and grumbles hiccup and astrid exchange a sheepish grin
hiccups prosthetic foot snapping into the modified stirrup
dragon deblois sanders final draft rev
the two pieces click together forming a single shape
astride toothless hes whole again
he rotates the pedal
the new tail opens
bright red with a skull and viking horns emblazoned on it
hiccup and toothless saddled up and ready to fly
astrid backs her nadder into position
toothless snorts an excited yes
from his mount hiccup looks out over the changed world
it snows nine months of the year
and hails the other three
they leap into the bright blue sky together as one
astrid follows giving chase
any food that grows here is tough and tasteless
the people that grow here are even more so
hiccup and astrid race their dragons through the village under eaves over rooftops down cliff sides and between ship masts
its a high energy romantic dance of sorts
the only upsides are the pets
while other places have
ponies or parrots we have
their fellow recruits join them as they take to the open sky rocketing far above the village
the northern sky swirls with blazing multicolored dragons
hiccup and toothless break from the pack spinning into the blinding sun
