written by rashida jones will mccormack
a progression of images of celeste and jesse ages to
visual media evolves with them throughout the years
celeste is a chronic overachiever and jesse is sweet goofy and funny
he makes her laugh
they are best friends but its clear that jesse wishes they were more
close up of their hands crossed making c and j shapes
celeste and her football player boyfriend mike kissing
jesse watches enviously from the sidelines holding mikes helmet
they go to college together study together drink together
they are still best friends
junior year celeste with saleem her hot black militant boyfriend
they kiss passionately
a moment later jesse poses reluctantly with the couple holding up a black power fist weakly
senior year jesse draws c and j forever in a pristine snowy forest with a stick he and celeste laugh
a moment later they kiss deeply
they are finally together
on an engraved necklace carved into a tree written on a wet beach and on their wedding cake
moving into their house dancing reading side by side kissing
this is true everlasting love the real kind
celeste and jesse in silence amongst joyful party guests
jesse telling a joke and celeste no longer laughing
jesse and celeste on a bench distant
the next picture hugging
jesse asleep on celestes shoulder as she kisses him on the head
its a bright clear los angeles saturday afternoon
celeste and jesse now both sing along to love rhino the song heard under the montage
jesse drives while celeste is on her blackberry
jesse boyishly handsome wears an old tee and a hooded sweatshirt
celeste is wearing all black workout gear
she is always wearing all black
im a love rhino
dont worry bout me ive dont worry bout me ive got a enough love for got enough love for the two the
her blackberry rings us
oh shit i gotta take this
turn it down

jess turn it down seriously
she playfully slaps him
he turns it down
with jesse running errands
to jesse turn it down
back to the phone yeah i can do it now
no itll be fast right
to jesse hey i have to give a quick sound bite for the new york times so no noise please
for a second
i may have an important call coming in too so
they both know he has no important call coming in
on the phone okay
this year all trends point towards simplicity and comfort
celeste is momentarily distracted by a bad driver in front of them
jess just go around him
to the phone sorry
consumers will be less likely to go out for entertainment
while celeste is dictating jesse is getting bored
he starts looking through the middle console
he finds something
a melted tube of chapstick
ooh a cigarette
jesse lights the cigarette takes a drag
celeste looks at jesse and signals to him can i have a drag
uhhh things like voodoo casual wear and cookbooks will see a huge spike in the market
he hands her the cigarette and she promptly chucks it out the window
what the shit
she whispers to jesse shhh
back to her call thats enough of a blurb right
jesse is now checking out nose hairs in the visor mirror
he then looks at his teeth
does this tooth look dark
celeste just glares at him
call me back if they need more
jesse looks at his tooth again in the rearview mirror
like a little darker than the rest
celeste waves her hand to quiet jesse
okay thanks bye
to jesse cant you just sit still for two minutes
and we talked about this no more smoking
i wasnt smoking i just found it
they drive by urban light chris burdens installation at the entrance of lacma
they are rows of restored street lamps
not doin it
that is not art
i think its beautiful
a beat passes
then jesse pulls over
what are you doing
why are you stopping
well your appointment is not until noon and this is that place with the deadstock vintage italian fabric
i thought it would be good for the guest room windows
celeste is truly touched by the gesture
you are so thoughtful
jesse smiles proud of himself
she gives him a kiss on the cheek
jesses phone rings he answers
celeste rolls her eyes and gets out of the car to look at fabric
celeste is getting back in the car with some fabric swatches
jess that place is insane
they have tassels that were manufactured for mussolinis mistress
covering the phone sorry im on the phone
celeste sits quietly while jesse is on his call
dont know what to say
thank you so much for calling me
celeste throws her hands up in silent celebration
whispers did you get the job
jesse signals with his finger one minute
well sometimes things are just meant to work out
celeste looks at him with anticipation
was that the job
did you get the book job
no but celeste
he looks at her and grabs her hand with tears in his eyes
a swell came in last night
out of the northeast
its overhead and its glassy
what the fuck are you talking about
the waves are peeling out there
is this about surfing
youre talking about going surfing
no this is best part
skillz got a hi def digital camera and hes gonna film me
and were gonna upload it on you tube
is that not awesome
no yeah i just thought it was about the slate job you interviewed for
they havent called yet
but if they dont think im the right artist to illustrate the book then its not the right job for me
you know what i mean
i absolutely do yes
you are a wonderful artist
but at some point you will show the world that one day
hey can i drop you at home now

i just missed another one
take me home its fine
jesse is dropping celeste at home
be back by six so you can shower
dinner with beth and tucker

aw so wrong

he promptly blasts the radio and flashes their signature c and j hand sign
she flashes it back
he zooms off
celeste and jesse are on double date with beth petite and full of energy and tucker preppy in an indy way
these are their best friends from college
did you end up going to see that band at spaceland last week
oh the injured saint
they are real
you know what
they should be your wedding band
theyre loud but theyre affordable
they opened for darcy fudged his knickers

or you should see if emergency breakthrough is available
the horn section is tight

swing is so late s honey
beth leans over a gives him a deep kiss
she knows how to work him

well talk about this later
celeste looks over the menu
celeste and jesses next interaction is said with heavy really bad german accents which is hilarious only to them

i dont vant dessert
i vill joost have bite oof yorrrs

celeste and jesse giggle at their stupid inside joke for a little too long
then there is a deafening lull in the conversation
beth is buttering a piece of bread
she loudly drops the knife on her plate and buries her head in her hands
i cant do this
i just cant
celeste is genuinely concerned about her friend
are you okay
its just not right
i cant hold my tongue
we cant do this anymore
honey weddings are stressful i know all about it
but you guys well be fine
we are fine
what the fuck are you two doing
jesse and celeste look at beth in amazement
what do you mean
yeah what do you mean
what do i mean
you guys are not together anymore
this is not normal
youve been separated for six months and you hang out every day like nothings wrong
its fucking weird
no tucker you think its weird too

lets not play charades anymore
we are separated and were friends
you guys should be happy all we did was fight before
yeah you guys should be thrilled about this
youll never have to pick sides
yeah everyones cool
everyone is not cool
this is not cool
its just not working for me im sorry
beth gets up and walks out
celeste and jesse sit there and stare at tucker in silence
bett iz zo angry
yah she iz uber angry
yeah you guys are weird
i cant do this
its fucked up
tucker gets up and leaves
jesse and celeste watch him leave and sip their wine quietly
celeste drives and jesse is in the passenger seat
he has a tube of vaseline lip therapy
he is stroking it rapidly as if it were a penis
this is not the first time
celeste looks at him
she joins in
she reaches over and pushes in on the tube
vaseline comes out of the top
this looks a lot like a penis ejaculating
they both erupt in laughter
even though this is the thousandth time theyve done this stupid joke it will always be funny
beth and tucker are crazy
its not weird that we hang out
do you think its weird we hang out
no of course not
youre my best friend
yeah you too
i mean we cant not hang out
the last time we didnt talk for longer than a week was in th grade when you went to space camp canada
yeah that was weeks of torture
i mean the anti gravity training was insane but i missed you
celeste and jesse stand in the driveway of celestes house
there is a bit of a linger
well im exhausted
celeste walks to her front door with her key and jesse heads towards the side gate with his key
it is now obvious that he is living in her guest house
hey its kinda chilly tonight hows the heat in there
oh its fine
he keeps walking
he turns again to celeste
sorry im still living here
times are tough and moneys tight so you know
jesse please you can stay here as long as you like
its your studio
its actually really nice to have you here
for me too
oh dont forget the contractor needs to get in there for measurements in the morning
so make sure your thingys your sculptures whatever
are out of the way
love you too
celestes morning symphony is under way
she sits in front of a bowl of oatmeal a bowl of berries a cup of coffee neatly stacked newspapers her laptop and the television tuned to cnn
she methodically eats sips her coffee reads the paper watches tv and surfs the internet
she is clearly a culture vulture
jesse walks by outside his studio and does the c and j sign to celeste
she does it back instinctively
is it weird that we hang out so much
she shakes it off and titters
shes being ridiculous its fine
celeste walks in dressed impeccably
again in all black
she is in a rush on her blackberry bombarded with a hefty pre work crowd
people are in some semblance of a line waiting to order
celeste spots a man in a business suit taking advantage of the confusion and cutting in front of a woman at the head of the line
large coffee please
excuse me sir
the business man pretends to not hear her
she taps him on the arm
he turns around
you do realize that you just cut in front of a lot of people
sorry i didnt know
did you not
im in a rush
so you did know
and everyones in a rush so
other people in line are now paying attention
celeste wants to let it go but she cant
well she was looking at the pastries i didnt think she was ready to order
well its not just her
its everyone behind her too
so if you want to ask all these people if its okay to cut in front of them because you are late be my guest
just dont assume that your time is more important than everyone elses
the business man gets his coffee
have a nice day
pop form headquarters looks like the future
no walls just large glass slabs separate the offices from each other
celeste is on camera in the middle of conducting a live satellite interview for msnbc
american culture is dying
we have an unrelenting appetite for processed junk food talentless pop stars like riley banks and recycled movie franchises like transformers
the more we consume crap the more we want crap
rachel maddow is conducting the interview in studio
sounds utterly hopeless
is there an upshot
i think there will be a groundswell movement towards simplicity
people will start to listen to their most rudimentary needs they will crave mental spiritual and physical nourishment
its back to basics
wow a lot to chew on
well thanks for being with us today
youre great come back any time
for more on this gloomy but interesting subject look out for trend forecaster celeste martins new book shitegeist on bookshelves monday
thanks so much rachel
scott celestes partner gay but very straight sharply dressed and bespectacled sits at his desk
so i had dinner with the drama club last night
tucker and beth
theyre such dicks
they left in protest because they think jesse and i are being unhealthy
so judgy right
youre only done when youre done
spare me the spiritual platitudes scotty
if we were gay she motions to scott no one would even question us being friends
you and jesse are clearly not ready to let each other go
and theres nothing wrong with that
yeah theres nothing wrong with that
i mean what do you think
well to be honest
celeste looks at an e mail her blackberry and interrupts
wait were signing riley banks
when were you going to tell me
i just trashed her on rachel maddow
yeah thats why i wanted you to come in
its a huge account
scott you and i built this company so we wouldnt have to take an account like riley banks
well you and i may not have a company if we dont take riley banks
shes like a
soul less hologram
she is releasing a new album
she wants us to do the branding and merchandising
we need to take this account
im gonna go eat lunch
celeste starts to heads out
if you are looking for my opinion i do think you should start dating
i dont do dating
the right guy will show up
and im still on track for my year plan
no one has a year plan
except for my mortgage company
first child at
which means i will only be at my eldests college graduation
the bad news is that i may not be at my th grandchilds high school graduation
but thats okay i guess
im fascinated with the mentally ill
ive got time
im not worried
well do me a favor and get your fuck on before you meet the next guy
celeste looks at scott in shock
what are you doing
sorry i was trying to be your saucy gay friend
it didnt feel good
jesse and skillz another man boy in hip hop gear wait in a very very long line of very very hip people at las trendiest new yogurt place
the economic climate is real bad man
and i think my business is taking the hardest hit of all
and no ones talking about it
you sell pot
not for long dude
have you been to those weed pharmacies
theyre killing me
i gotta branch out
maybe start working in methamphetamines
or maybe teach pre school
i always wanted to do that
i love kids
skillz is distracted by something
sorry i know this is serious talky time but would you look at the fucking seat on that girl
we see a girls apple bottom butt stuffed into blue jeans
that is a party
jesse does not laugh
he looks like he is in pain
i dont think its over
no it will never be over
it goes on forever
its like space
no celeste and i
i think shes just confused and overwhelmed right now about everything
but shell come around
she always does
its been a while now
i think its over bro
it may be time to accept that and move on
call that dime veronica
jesse looks uncomfortable
that was a one time thing a couple months after celeste and i broke up
celeste does not know about that
and we will keep it that way
didnt know that was a hit and run
sounded like you liked her
well shes not celeste
its always been celeste
im not ready to give up
okay but remember you cant re heat a souffle
also theres bettys everywhere
maybe its good to remind celeste that you can pull wool
make her sweat a little bit
it definitely wouldnt hurt to
go out with somebody
they reach the front of the line
do you know what you want
yeah i want to not be a quitter
i dont want to start all over again
i want everything that i believed to have been true to be true
i also want a goji berry green tea swirl with yogurt chips and fruity pebbles
to yogurt girl hey you should go out on a date with my friend here
um wait wheres your wife
you guys are here like everyday together
i mean bummer
celeste and beth wander amidst the modern art
they stop to take in a cindy sherman photo
but kind of beautiful
in a grotesque way
ugh lets keep moving
too many feelings
celeste and beth wander to the wall and stare at a damien hirst collage
i need to say this and then ill never bring it up again
im sorry i wigged on you guys the other night but i dont know what youre doing
i think its stupid that youre not together
you are best friends and thats the hard part
nothing else matters
celeste and beth stand in silence
then beth the reality is i love jesse dearly but he doesnt have a checking account
or dress shoes
the father of my children will have a car
jesse will always be my best friend
ive said my peace
its your life
but i definitely dont think he should be living in your guest house
i think youre kind of breaking his heart
jesse is fine
can i show you something
beth suddenly pulls celeste into a corner
with no art
she points to her neck
what am i looking at
its a hair
on my neck
will you get that thing lasered off please
what the fuck
i cant because it will pop up somewhere else where i cant keep my eye on it
are you serious
thats the craziest thing ive ever heard
its not a turnip
trust me i know my body
its a cruel land mine
okay well at least pluck it for chrissake
i should at least before my wedding right
what is wrong with you
celeste grabs the hair and pulls it out
in pain ahhhhhhhhhh
a security guard heads for them
sorry sir my friend has a really strong emotional reaction to modern art
that was fucking rude
had to be done
the studio is beautifully magically chaotic
there are large canvasses everywhere paint rags spray cans common household items turned into sculptures buttons clothespin hangers and mobiles
celeste walks in
jesse is on a mattress on the floor hes clearly been sitting there for a while
he is fist deep in a huge bag of cheetos and hes watching the beijing olympics on tivo
he is watching a short feature about olympian matthias steiner a gold medalist in weight lifting
youre not working
are you watching the olympics
jesse blows his nose
god you really love that dont you
matthias wife died in a car accident last year
well three years ago now but
and he dedicated his gold medal to her
the human spirit is
jesse is choked up can barely speak
hey did you finish that artwork for the pop form website
oh yeah im almost done
im working on it
i think youll really like it
ill like it more when i have it because i needed it yesterday so
jesse turns off the television takes a deep breath wipes his eyes and recovers
celeste can you sit down for a minute
i have something really important to tell you
does it have something to do with the work you owe me
jesse sits next to her
again he has tears in his eyes
i dont know how to tell you this but
i have a date tonight
im gonna start dating
that is so great
good for you jess
that doesnt bother you
well its actually the yogurt girl
from yoga yurt
yogurt girl huh
but so young right
her body is all time
okay no need for that
but this is good
you gotta crawl before you walk
i mean shes definitely not gonna be wifey number two right
well its just a date
she hugs him in an unconsciously patronizing way
im proud of you
jesse looks confused and slightly hurt
can i get up now
celeste gets up and is immediately fixated by his hair
yeah skillz kinda made me do it and from the get go she was way into
what are you looking at
are you gonna wear your hair like that
i dont know is it weird
not weird just different from how it looks best
she walks over and starts messing with his hair as he continues
anyway this is what were doing right
were getting divorced and were friends and were also dating people
thats what were doing
she is satisfied with her work
she steps back
youll be great
you dont even need to be great
just be you
take her somewhere nice
call me after
jesse is on a date with yogurt girl
its clear hes hasnt been doing a lot of talking
so i was in school but then i dropped out because i really wanted to work in fashion but its really hard to find a paid internship
so i went back to school and now i work at yoga yurt part time but im really looking to make money doing something i love
but im sure the universe is looking out for me and when the time is right the right thing will come along you know
celeste is in bed on the computer
she hears noise from the outside
she listens more intently and hears jesse
and a woman giggling and talking loudly
then the studio door shuts
is yogurt girl sleeping over
he wouldnt do that
again with the morning symphony
celeste drinks coffee eats breakfast surfs the internet and flips through magazines
this time shes also listening to a song from riley banks new album
its exactly what she thought it would be
overproduced auto tuned and meaningless
she nods her head yeah i get it
she turns it off
celeste cant stop herself from constantly looking over at the studio to see if yogurt girl is still in there
finally a sleeping jesse stirs for a minute and changes position
he is alone
celeste beth tucker and jesse browse as a foursome for books
where is it
they told me it would be in new releases
celeste searches frantically for her book
she peeks around a corner at a very obscured aisle with a sign reading more new releases
three copies of her book shitegeist appear in the very bottom row barely visible
she is disappointed
thats what i call placement
she grabs a copy of her book and briskly walks back to the front of the store
well you probably shouldnt steal it
even if it is yours
celeste marches to the oprahs book club table and swiftly replaces the center display book with her own
but you dont have the o on your cover you cant do that
yes i can
jesse and tucker arrive and see the book
there you guys are
youre on oprahs book list
thats so great
something catches celestes eye
some people are browsing my book
guys come with me to eavesdrop
celeste tucker and beth head off
jesse turns to see veronica stunning and european
how are you
you look great
thanks you too
hows your clothes pin collage going
slowly but its going
well dont give up
your work is really unique
i hope that doesnt sound
no thats means a lot thank you
they looks at each other for a beat
i had so much fun
im so sorry i didnt call you
my life is just
i had a lot of fun too
there is silence as beth celeste and tucker arrive and stare at her
who is this creature
oh sorry veronica this is beth and tucker and celeste
veronica notices celestes name on the book
oh this is your book
i read an excerpt online its really compelling
wow thank you
that is so nice
well nice to see you
oh you too
she turns and leaves
what is that
that was uh
just this girl i met a while ago
celeste changes focus again and turns to a borders employee to loudly and unconvincingly act out interested reader for other shoppers to hear
he looks at her like shes crazy and keeps walking
and so do her friends
jesse and skillz are exiting a bizmarkie concert surrounded by older hip hop fans and young hipsters who werent alive when the biz dropped his first album
they are trashed
oh baby youuuuuuuu you got what i neeeeeed
and you say hes just a friend and you say hes just a friend
oh baby youuuuu
oh baby youuuuu
jesses iphone rings
a very flirty picture of celeste comes up
no no no
ignore for sure
uh i just need to
picks up hey
talking to celeste uh huh
no im not busy
hangs up uh im gonna go home
come on after the show its the after party
theres an ikea dresser that she needs me to build
skillz takes this in
he is impressed
are you guys
i told you pal i know what im know im doing
she just needed time
celeste is in a corner with a glass of wine and a huge bag of nuts and bolts
she had a fight with a dresser and the dresser won
jesse uses his key and enters
im in here
oh baby youuuuu
it was definitely easier to build the brooklyn bridge i think
well how hard can it be
its a dresser right
jesse is drunker than before and sitting where celeste was earlier
hes covered in sawdust and nuts and bolts
do you think they intentionally pick a random piece of furniture to make totally unbuildable just to fuck with you
i got it
we see jesse and celeste admire their dresser as they drink wine
fucking lay up
we reveal that they are looking at a small mangled swedish robot constructed from the nuts and bolts and wood panelling that should have been the dresser
they both slide to the floor in satisfaction
they look at their artwork
they laugh they are pretty drunk
ruscha meets basquiat
meets serra meets corky from life goes on
hes a vegan you know
that is so cute
they share a laugh
celeste looks at him
she kisses him
he kisses back
it gets hotter
they fall back
celeste and jesse are in bed
celeste is asleep
jesse wakes up and gently kisses celeste all over her face
this wakes her up
she is hungover and confused
what are you doing
i love you
celeste does not respond
she pops up out of bed
we should talk about this
whoa we were drunk
what a bad idea
dont be sorry
it was nice
and i love you
oh jess i dont
come on we were drunk and the dresser and i thought
youre dating other people
god im so stupid
he realizes how pathetic it sounds
oh no i thought
you thought what
well clearly i wasnt thinking
or i wouldnt have let it happen
come on jess were not getting back together you didnt think
celeste realizes he did think
jesse is crushed
he gets up and leaves
you know theres a guy that you can call from ikea that will build youre dresser
you should call him
hell hell probably fuck you too
im a fucking idiot
no i didnt
celeste collapses back in the bed
a bunch of los angeles hipsters file out of a yoga class
everyone is sweaty and a little out of it
celeste heads out as she towels off
she heads towards the shoe cubby holes
i said hello
celeste keeps walking briskly
paul short but handsome tries to keep up with her
a little too loud how was your practice
it was fine
who is this guy
i see you in class a lot
you have a great warrior two
are you single
celeste puts on her shoes
are you really doing this right now
youre really doing this right now
paul realizes that his game is wack
yeah i cant believe it either
i dont do this its just happening i cant stop
what do you do
just gonna jump right in there
wow captain conversation
heres my card
you bring cards to yoga
look youre really pretty
im not good at this
he smiles nervously
she looks at the card
a financial analyst
its not cool
did you ever tell me what you did for a living
no no i didnt
there is a pause in conversation
celeste continues to put her shoes on
well will you
id love to know
im a trend forecaster
i forecast trends
paul scoffs at the notion that this is a real career
they have reached the parking lot
celeste turns to him with purpose
you traded in your porsche for an audi because the economy is tanking and youre afraid youll lose your job soon
you bought a samsung cell phone because you think it makes you seem more business oriented unlike the iphone which is for teenage girls
you go to yoga because you went to a sub ivy league college spent the last ten years working long weeks and drinking all weekend and you feel like its
time to do something spiritual
nice to meet you looks at the card paul
celeste walks away
paul remains where he is flummoxed
celeste enters through her side gate
she has some chinese takeout in her hand
she heads for the studio
she sees that jesse is not there
neither is any of his shit
its completely empty and sterile now
celeste is about to go on the road for work
she is on the phone
no just make sure the san fran focus group has a little more diversity than last time
it was like a rave
she hangs up and pauses
then dials again
hey jess its me
im getting on a plane but id really like to talk to you
i dont know what happened last night
hope youre okay
we see celeste having lunch with a group of eight teenagers
she asks questions they share laughs she engages with them
she is good at this
she excuses herself to make a phone call
celeste watches cnn alone
she dials jesse
jesse is mid laugh and looks at his phone to see celeste is calling
he presses ignore
we see that he is sitting with a women
we reveal that it is veronica
im glad you called
jesse smiles big
i miss you
anyway call me
she hangs up takes a breath and then to herself i love you
im so sorry
ive always loved you
jesse is walking
on the phone hey
i want to talk to you
celeste is in her home office working on the riley account
yeah i want to talk to you too
where have you been
its been like two weeks
so much to lay down
like did you know that pay per view porn is available in cantonese
like subtitles or dubbed
wait actually im really close to your house right now
can i come by for a minute
celeste puts away groceries
i have to tell you something
wait you first
are you gay
no not gay
he takes a really deep breath
um youre not gonna believe this but
playfully oh no did you go on another date
im having a baby
i dont understand
im having a baby
celeste is still busy putting away groceries
she is half listening
what do you mean
i am having a baby
celeste opens the pantry and puts away cereal
with another person
with another person
celeste takes out cold cuts from the bag and opens the fridge
sorry im confused
what the fuck
whats a veronica
you actually met her
that day at the book store
but thats not even physically possible that was two weeks ago
well the truth is i slept with veronica three months ago
it was just a one night thing
but shes pregnant
celeste rearranges the fruit bowl
didnt know about that
but thats not important right now
this is not good
you and i are gonna deal with this
we will well just have to
what do you need me to do
no you dont have to do anything
but you dont even know this person right
yeah i know her
i mean im getting to know her
and i really want to make it work with her
make it work
you slept with her once
what are you talking about
ive actually been seeing her well a lot recently
and i think i really like her
so what youre saying is you got a girl pregnant and now you think you like her because shes pregnant
im really confused
the universe is fucking weird celeste
i slept with her months ago and never called her after
but we started hanging recently and she told me she was pregnant with my child
i know its crazy but it just feels
it was like this really weird retroactive gift
i dont know
can you excuse me for a second
celeste gets up and walks slowly to the bathroom
she gently shuts the door
she looks around not knowing what to do with herself
she focuses on a crack in the wall she looks closer and then grabs the wall thinking she might faint
she silently begins to sob mouth open eyes shut tight
she collapses on the wall
she is in silent turmoil
is this really happening
jesse is sitting waiting
he checks his cell phone
he hears the toilet flush
a moment goes by
celeste re enters having pulled it together
but her face is still wet with tears
sorry about that
i had something in my eye
look i know this is so sudden
and so weird
ive been holding on to us this idea of us for so long
and i know youve wanted me to let go
so im sorry
you were right were friends
we will always be friends
and i need that now
jesse gives celeste a big long hug
wait you had something to tell me too
celeste takes a beat
it was nothing
she forces a smile
celeste is on the computer
she drinks coffee
scott peeks in
celeste lets out a guffaw
what are you doing
im just following diddy twitty
know what that means
its sean combs twitter page
theres also a singing competition on television

its very sudden
celeste pauses to consider this
well let me see

scott is not convinced
celeste is still distracted by the computer

i agree go be admired

celeste in workout clothes is cleaning up her house maniacally
she is walking past her office
the ikea robot she built with jesse catches her attention for a moment
she keeps walking
celeste and max handsome and clean cut are sitting at dinner
they have just ordered
she hands the menu back to the waiter
my foot actually pronates
and my i
band is strained when i run which really hurts
ozar recommended a foot specialist who made these customized orthotics for me and its amazing how much better i feel

suddenly celeste catches a glimpse of jesse sitting at the bar by himself watching tv
she is not prepared for this
oh my god

celeste immediately scarfs down her salad which has just arrived
how was that

celeste stares at jesse at the bar
he always loved the meatballs here
do you like bread
um yeah i like bread
silence once again
celeste and max wait for their cars at the valet stand
maxs car arrives
he pays the valet
this was great
im free next wednesday

oh because of mercury poisoning
i think thats a myth
i go to this acupuncturist that

to get over you know your divorce
it took me a long time to start dating after mine
thank you for your concern but im just fine
i guess youre just not a match for me
well have a good night
max gets in his car and is gone
celeste stands there confused and alone
she shakes him off
celeste is running
it is a cacophony of street sounds around her traffic honking speeding celeste listens to the dirty projectors stillness is the move on her ipod and joyfully runs across the
celeste arrives to meet beth
she is in full marathon gear
she waves at beth and enters panting
hi wow you are really out of breath
did you fucking run here
from west hollywood
yeah i ran
its really fun
youre soaking wet
isnt that like miles
i was just clearing my head you know keeping the endorphins up
celeste pants like shes about to collapse
she doubles over with her hands on her knees
shes in pain
want to sit down
wow is this it
its so nice
celeste flops on the couch full prostrate
a saleswoman approaches
im so sorry but thats a one of a kind piece that was handwoven by a tribe of afghani women
so if you could maybe just sit over there
the saleswoman points to a metal industrial uncomfortable looking chair
wow you are a sweat tsunami
you should get it
its really pretty
celeste gets up and there is an outline of celestes entire body in sunblock and sweat
they look at the wreckage
i know people who can get that out
i guess im getting it
the saleswoman is ringing beth up for the couch
it is basically ruined
the riley account is a handful
ive been sooooo swamped
its great youre staying busy
about the couch if it doesnt come out i can have it reupholstered
sorry can i get your card
here you go
datings really great
have you talked to jesse

so my first available delivery is monday afternoon
does that work for you
yeah thats fine
if you can you just call my cell
shes dumb right
oh no not dumb
simple means dumb
no actually simple in a really elegant way
the saleswoman senses awkwardness
okay so youre all set then
thanks a lot
to celeste they head for the exit
i thought you would be happy for him
i am i just didnt realize that monica was elegant
and you know what
you would probably really like her
beth studies celeste for a moment
youre not having regrets about jesse
please let me drive you home
im afraid youll drown
i have a date tonight so i should probably shower before then
beth looks at a sopping celeste
whos the date
the gap model
oh my god hes so hot but hes like
skillz set me up
hes about to be a huge star
hes filming b
its the prequel to fuck i loved that movie
i loved that movie too
it really spoke to me
rupert bates very handsome british wearing a leather jacket sporting tousled actor hair is playing a hideously earnest original song on the guitar
he sings with passion
he looks up at celeste and winks
celeste on the couch looking slightly mortified
she smiles tepidly at him
rupert finishes the song closes his eyes and hangs his head
a beat of silence
celeste musters up a short and slow round of applause
that was so
i wrote that for my mum
so how do you know skillz
he provides me with the happy smoky green treats
what a dork
rupert slides next to celeste and is all of a sudden right in her face
he touches her hair
he kisses her deeply
he pulls away and takes her in
hello special one
whispers oh no no no i gotta go
people file out of the conference room
celeste walks down the hall quickly to the bathroom
celeste enters a stall
then she hears two girls enter the bathroom
riley and savannah are chatting and primping
celeste goes quiet and listens
my hair is so dry
it looks like straw
savannah quickly pops a pill
then offers one to riley
do you want an adderall
no that shit makes me feel like a robot
speaking of robot who the hell designed this place
its like spock and his eyebrows are about to walk around the corner
celeste takes this opportunity to flush and come out of the stall
hi riley im celeste im a partner at pop form
wow youre pretty
riley looks closer at her skin and picks at it
why am i breaking out
too much sugar
ugh maybe its my skin regime
its actually regimen
regime is a system of government
its a skin regimen
riley and savannah glare at celeste
nice to meet you
the riley banks branding strategy meeting is under way
slides are being shown scott is giving a presentation on design ideas
celeste is distracted and on her blackberry
we see an insert of celestes blackberry on dictionary
com looking up regime a mode or system of rule or government
celeste has some ideas for the logo which are looking really great
he looks to celeste who is not paying attention
she is busy learning that she was right and riley was wrong
celeste looks up and shoots a patronizing smile at riley
riley catches her and looks away uncomfortably
do you wanna
so we are going for an industrial feel with the artwork
hello special one
uh you got my im
sounds so awful
where are the guys who dont wear makeup for a living
and maybe a little intellect
a little intellect wouldnt hurt anybody
scott has an idea
youve never met nick right
you know him
yeah we went to school together
this could be perfect
she sings like shes in a musical im uncomfortable with daaaaaating
i dont like any of iiiiiit
he sings back trust meeeee
you will liiiiike hiiiim
also i love cooo ooock
you really got to try a little harder to integrate the gayness scott
celeste sits on the balcony with nick moran
he has indy rocker hair and a los feliz beard
hes hip and smart in an effortless way
celeste is feeling him
they drink wine and laugh
so you pissed in your pants
i waited seven hours
three of them soaking in my own pee
but i finally got the shot of ahmadinejad
he hands her a photograph
that is incredible
i think hes smiling maybe
i think the piss stain running down my jeans made him laugh
well the world will think youre brilliant
no one will ever know but me
i was nominated for a pulitzer
i didnt win
well the guy who won shit his pants so
they are connecting
looking at his watch oh my god we missed our reservation
it was at
should i call down and see if they can still take us
how about room service
nick and celeste are kissing
its passionate but tender
they stop and their foreheads rest against each others and they take a deep breath
they speak in hushed tones
that was really really nice
so what are you doing for the rest of your life
making out with you
they start to kiss again
i dont remember it ever feeling like this
they continue to kiss
celeste notices that she and the couch are vibrating
she looks down
nick is masturbating
can he really be masturbating
whisper what are you doing
whisper what do you think im doing
whisper why are you doing that
dont do that
it was going so well
celeste pulls away slowly shaking her head no
nick keeps going
im almost there
celeste cannot believe what she is watching
celeste quickly grabs her stuff and gets the hell out of dodge
ah ah ahhhhhhhhh
nick recovers from his climax and looks around to realize shes gone
celeste runs really hard listening to her sunny levines glass jaw on her iphone
she stops suddenly
she sees jesses number she hits ignore
she starts running again with purpose
celeste drives and listen to her phone on bluetooth
hey so im glad you can meet up
pm is good
theres this little place by me vegan vittles on elysian way kinda hard to find call me if you get lost
celeste enters and sees jesse sitting at a table in a small folksy restaurant
celeste is on the phone
she waves at jesse and gestures one second
no i dont want to do a video chat
just tell her she needs to get to l
she hangs up now on the blackberry sorry one second i just have to send this e mail
jesse sits there and wait for several seconds for her to finish her e mail
to waitress can i get some coffee
we have yerba matte
um green tea
we have decaf green tea
anything for you
ill get the veganchilada with the cashew cheese sauce on the side
oh can i look at the seaweed menu
she hands him a tiny piece of recycled paper

she notices his feet

oh yeah theyre vegan
celeste could throw up
you look good too
a lot of pilates
huh i didnt know you did pilates
yeah well veronicas a dancer and has equipment at our house so
there is an uncomfortable beat
work is great
my book is getting great reviews
riley banks is a new client which is huge
things are going really well
listen i know this has all been pretty weird
its only weird if you think its weird
celeste i never wanted to hurt you
glad we cleared that up
look i actually wanted to see you because
apparently theres some kind of hold up on your side with the divorce papers and veronicas actually not a citizen so
wheres she from
point is we need to
i really need you to sign those papers
well jesse ive been busy with work
because some people work for a living
so i havent really been focused on what i can do to help you get on with your new life
what makes you think you are even suitable to be a dad
you dont even know how to read the electric bill
how are you going to support yourself
have you even thought this through
i guess ill have to figure it out
veronica is really supportive of my work
i paid the rent for ten years
if thats not supportive i dont know what is
and thank you
there is a long pause
we never even talked about kids
you had reservations about having kids
i had reservations about having kids with you
i think veronica will be a really good mother
celeste gets up from the table
she collects her things
ill sign the fucking papers
i dont have time for this
youre ridiculous this place is ridiculous
fucking vegan kelp cashew bullshit
what the fuck is this place anyway
she addresses the restaurant do any of you have jobs
what do you do
wait let me guess
you grow pot
celeste looks at an innocent bespectacled patron
get a real job
celeste is in her robe about to get in the bath
she walks to the kitchen to grab a tea and walks by her office
the ikea robot catches her eye
she stops and enters the office
celeste stares at the robot
it stares back
she hates it
she kicks it
she violently with all her might rips its head off
that felt good
she picks it up and starts to thrash the robot torso all over the room as slowly pieces of wood flail in every direction
shes angry and out of control
she stops to catch her breath and sees what she has just done
she falls to the ground in tears
celeste and beth enter and survey the scene
beth is dressed like a little boy with a short brown wig sunglasses and sneakers
celeste is in a white trash bag with a belt
jesses a fucking vegan
a vegan whos soon to have his work shown
at the gagosian
what the fucking clothespin thing
dont tell me actually
how did anybody even know about his art he doesnt
i dont actually want to know
god hes on fire right now
breaking up with me was the best thing that ever happened to jesse
i should break up with me
someone elses success is not your demise c
unless its jesses
who are dressed as again
ooh he just got a buzzcut
a couple hours ago
it was on perez
thats so sad
his hair was everything
i need to fucking drink
two large dudes one dressed as peter pan the other as snow white walk by
were doing car bombs in the kitchen
celeste is drilling car bombs with guys
shes keeping pace
what are you
oh white trash
snow white is silent
celeste points to her trash bag
doesnt get it huh
paul from yoga enters to grab some ice from the freezer
he is wearing a black shirt covered in mini cereal boxes with plastic knives through them
celeste is mid car bomb and wasted
yeah i havent seen you there for a while
ive been running a lot
keeps you in better shape
i can see thats important to you
referring to the car bomb in her celeste is now drunk
hows your practice
waving her finger in his face laughing white trash
what are you
um a cereal killer obviously
by the way you were right
all of it the car the phone the yoga
except that i did go to an ivy league school
barely an ivy
do you smoke
celeste and paul sit away from the party smoking cigarettes
playful sorry about that day at the gym
i feel really open after yoga
dont say open
your costumes great
dont ruin it
i only go to yoga to meet girls
speaking of whats the deal with you and me
is this happening
my husband of six years wants a divorce so he can marry the woman whos carrying his child
thats the deal with you and me
im sorry that sounds tough
hes having a baby with a girl he barely knows
hes so lost
hes just going about it all
and youre right
what do you mean
well do you want to be right or do you want to be happy
listen yoga i dont want to be right i am right
people will let you down
ive accepted that fact but unfortunately most of the time knowing that does keep you from being happy
but at least its real
no one has ever given a more self righteous monologue wearing only a trash bag
except for maybe the homeless guy outside my dry cleaners
beth and tucker approach celeste and paul
time to go drunky
they head off
yells to celeste call me
celeste is going through papers on her desk
shes cleaning house
she sees the envelope from the divorce lawyer
she quickly tosses it aside
then she comes across one of jesses old notebooks
she flips through it
she reads a couple of sweet passages about her it makes her smile
she grabs the phone
hey its celeste
you know i still have a bunch of your stuff in the office
you should probably grab it at some point
she hangs up
she makes a decision
she grabs a box and starts throwing everything and anything in it that belongs to jesse
celeste carries a box of jesses stuff to his front door
she doesnt knock
she leaves the box by the door
but she decides to keep the one journal with the sweet passages for herself she deserves it and hell never know
she starts to walk away when she notices its trash day
jesse drives and veronica is in the passenger seat
they are quiet and content
they look at each other and smile
after a youre going to be a really good dad
why did you say that
veronica studies jesses face
i dont know i just know it
no ones ever said that to me
three trash cans green brown and blue are lined up in the driveway
a huge box is protruding from the blue can
so much to be learned from the trash
she slowly walks over
she peeks in at the box it has a big picture of a fancy stroller on the side of it
at least they recycle
veronica looks out the window
so weird but i just realized
whats your middle name
i dont even know it
they laugh a little
it means loved by the gods
what does it mean
means im really jewish
theyre getting to know each other
celeste is still digging in the trash
she looks further down
thats quite an extravagant purchase for a freelance writer and his elegant belgian bride
all of a sudden her diamond bracelet slips off her wrist and plunks to the bottom
shit shit shit
she drops jesses journal to the concrete and crawls into the trash can still reaching for the bottom not quite getting there
the trash can falls over with her in it
just then jesses car pulls up and headlights shine on celeste half way in the trash can
she fumbles and then ow
a piece of glass from the can has sliced her face
she immediately wiggles out of the trash can stands it back up again
she looks for a place to run
its too late
she picks up the journal and hides behind the trash cans but jesse and veronica have been watching her whole opera from the car
jesse approaches a crouching celeste
celeste stands up slowly as if nothing is wrong
she is also holding jesses journal close to her chest
are you doing
she looks around to make an excuse
came over to drop off some of your stuff
but why were you in the trash can
i lost something
in the trash can
it was a whole thing
its over now
jesse and veronica just stare at celeste for a long beat
youve met veronica right
wow youre so pregnant right
i love your sweater
beat are you bleeding
oh she touches her cheek yeah i guess i am
let me get you something for that
its fine just a little cut
are you sure
im so sorry about this
no im sorry
well im late for things

you sure you dont want to come in for a drink
thats very nice but no
great to see you guys
she starts to walk away with the journal
is that mine
oh yeah thats weird
i dont know how
here you go
she laughs nervously and hands him his journal
celeste walks to her car
celeste listen to her work messages on speakerphone as she instant messengers with beth
celeste writes i went through jesses trash last night
beth writes back im coming to your office right now
the cereal killer
theres this yoga retreat in tulum that i just got an e mail about
uh thats not why im really calling
i just like you
call me back if you want to drink some cold beer with me
celeste and beth eat lunch in the zen garden outside the pop form building
celeste is picking at the end of her sandwich recounting the waking nightmare of last night
the cut on her face is neatly bandaged
you told her you liked her sweater
what are you twelve
it was a disaster
but you should have seen the sweater
beth am i losing my mind
please no more trash diving
lets focus on you now
this guys paul keeps calling me but i dont know
c you never know
just go out with him
it doesnt have to be perfect
i met him at the gym
im not meeting my husband at the gym

celeste is lying in a quiet dark room in thai fisherman pants and a large t shirt
she takes a deep breath
so where do you live
we reveal that she is lying next to paul they are both about to get thai massages
uh i live in westwood
in a condo
you are gonna love this place
youve never felt so relaxed in your life
cherry and lucky enter the masseuses
they all exchange quiet hellos and head nods
cherry and lucky get to work
lucky takes celestes leg and pushes it all the way over her head not the most comfortable position
responding to the stretch wow this is a unique place to take a date
yeah i take all my dates here
i feel special
they all are
paul takes a deep exhale as cherry rams her elbow into his shoulderblade
so how is being right about everything going for you
ive been on a real winning streak so i thought id call you
you know what
im happy you did
at that moment crack
lucky has celeste in a bear hug and it looks like she may have broken her back
i dont know what your definition of relaxing is but
trust me you need this right now
celeste and paul exit
he has a huge smile on his face
she looks like shes in pain
why would you take me to a place where asian people beat you up
that was absolute torture
but how do you feel
celeste takes a beat to see how she feels
i feel great actually
so shut up then
where are we going now
dont try to control me
you need to let go
in yoga we call it vairyaga
he strikes a reverse triangle yoga pose in the parking lot
oh my god dont with the yoga

teddy pendegrass love tko is playing and people are dancing actually dancing
no one is there to be seen there is no pretention
this place is

celeste takes in the atmosphere for a moment
she is happy to be out
she takes her hair down puts her hands through it trying to look a little better
paul is on the dance floor with two beers
celeste meets him takes her beer and downs a third of it
celeste looks up and paul has started to dance
he looks at celeste with jocular seduction
hes actually not a bad dancer
maybe hes good
okay no hes great
paul pulls celeste in and they dance together
shes sort of embarrassed but shes having fun
paul pulls away in a little spin and goes into a james brown splits move
celeste is into it now
she dances around him other people watch them
paul pulls celeste in close
celeste kisses paul quickly to his surprise
what was that for
vairyaga bro let go
not everything has to have a reason
they smile at each other
jesse skillz and tucker with their arms up cheering loudly
jesse skillz and tucker are taking in a high school cheerleading practice drinking tall boys and smoking cigs
despite their ragtag appearance do not be fooled
they are very loyal and knowledgable supporters
toe touch basket toss coming up
degree of difficulty
way to go becky
jesse is look at his iphone
he is looking at veronica and jesse baby registry what the fuck is a baby bjorn
its a very very tiny swedish man
its a baby carrier that allows your child to benefit from parental intimacy without the confinement of a stroller
why do you know that
we go to a lot of baby showers
i put a lot of babies in the ladies
a parent of a cheerleader looks at trio with disgust
jesse is still going through the registry list
birthing towels breast pump diaper genie
fuck im definitely having a baby
beat hows celeste
im fine tuning her cannibus levels right now just trying to find the right balance
celeste doesnt smoke pot
she does now
she loves it
jesse takes this in
tucker changes the subject
shes so sweet
yeah less sweet pregnant but its probably just hormones
but are you into it
yeah i really like her
she seems great
for someone that i dont really know thats having my baby
california love by tupac or whatever song we clear comes on and the cheerleaders start a routine
skillz stands up and starts breaking it down
hes not that good
jesse and tucker continue to talk
are you scared

just keep saying yes
im really proud of you
skillz looks at his cell phone
he shows jesse a text from celeste that reads i need green
shes like my top client now
celeste is home from her date with paul and is now obsessing on jesses facebook page
his status reads in a relationship
shes drunk and this makes her sad
oh theres a video
its of jesse and veronica
jesse presents veronica with a cake she laughs and blows out the candles
her doorbell rings
the door opens to reveal skillz
he holds up a bag of weed
step out of the shadows and into the light
are you crying
i dont know what im doing
dating is stupid and all of a sudden my ex husband bakes cakes
its probably fucking gluten free
can you just roll a joint please
skillz rolls a tight joint
day by day c
you need not trip
celeste takes a drag
what are they like together
jesse and veronica
you know theyre oh kay
jesse is trying
its not all rainbows and unicorns but
so hes not happy
i didnt say that
pop form employees file out of a riley banks meeting
riley approaches celeste
i really like the logo
oh thank you
yeah i think its perfect
pei influence is pretty cool
wow yeah there is a little of that happening
are you mocking me
no im just impressed that you know anything about architecture
why because im a pop star
you know what your thing is
contempt prior to investigation
youre convinced youre smarter than everyone and that is your dark little prison
how dare you
riley smiles at celeste turns and leaves
celeste is still reeling from rileys verbal undressing
dark little prison
bitch what does she know
you know whats a dark little prison
having to wear midriffs for a living
what does she
celeste is pulling into her driveway and notices
jesse sitting on her porch smoking a cigarette
what the fuck
celeste cautiously walks up to her front door
before she can speak jesse does
i started smoking again
i can see that
that must go well with your pilates
jesse looks sad and confused
i dont know what the rules are and im sure im breaking them but
god i really miss you
celeste tries to digest this
you want to come in
they are in her living room on the couch have a drink
veronica is friends with the assistant gallerist there and he just really loved my stuff
i dont know well see
jesse thats great
im so happy for you
why doesnt he seem happier
he knocks back the rest of the drink
i should probably get home
its really nice to see you
he hugs her
they breathe together
they hug tighter
he pulls away looks at her and kisses her for one second very tenderly
she pulls away
you should go
can we just
lay here for a bit
celeste lays down and jesse spoons behind her on the couch
they hold each other
theres a long drag of silence
i cant believe im having a baby
and its not with you
we see celestes face but jesse doesnt
the phone rings
celeste still in her clothes from the night before wakes up
jesse is gone
she fumbles for the phone
we have a massive problem on our hands
i need you in the office
insert of a large magnified version of rileys rb logo
it is pretty clear what the image looks like
scott stares at celeste waiting for her to freak out
i dont see anything
referring to the logo its a penis
and a butt
i dont see it
you cant be serious
points to the logo theres the penis
and theres the penis going into the butt
i think its a stretch
well its not a stretch celeste
scott puts a dvd into the dvd player
a reel of news clips comes on
teenagers were hoping to get a little bit of the teen stars fashion magic but instead they have been suprised by what they saw
theres homosexual butt sex in the logo
does riley think were that stupid
i will never support gay marriage
neither riley nor a representative from pop form the marketing company responsible could be reached for comment
scott turns it off
celeste what did you do
how could be so careless
celeste picks up the magnified logo again
oh my god
oh wow i totally see it now
celeste starts laughing uncontrollably
its the funniest thing shes ever seen
its a cock in a butt
fuming stop it
scott come on
no this is not a joke
our companys in serious danger
youre being dramatic
i cant with you right now
i have to deal with this
ill call you soon
her laughter fades and she exits the conference room
bon ivers skinny love plays as celeste walks slowly amongst the celebrity impersonators tourists and drunks on the hollywood walk of fame
it is intercut with a montage of super footage of celeste and jesse in the past at a seaside house jesse is reluctantly cutting a head off a fish to
cook it celeste is repulsed but laughing
celeste and jesse cuddle in a sleeping bag fighting off the cold
celeste and jesse take cover in a torrential new york city rain
they stand under an awning and she smiles as she runs her hand through his wet hair
celeste is abruptly shaken out of her memories by a giant chewbacca hugging her before she has a chance to stop him
we see jesse sitting at the dive bar
celeste enters and sits next to jesse
she is happy to see him
we gotta talk
thats why i called
wait let me say something
i dont know what happened last night
i dont know whats happening with your other situation
but i need to say this
for the record i fucked up
i was cavalier about you
i took us for granted
and i know this may sound crazy but id be remiss if i didnt
if you were open to it
i think that i could do better
if theres a chance still
id like to know
jesse cant even look at her
jesse gets up and leaves
jesse walks out of the bar
he takes a deep breath and starts walking
a beat later celeste tears out of the bar walking quickly after jesse
jesse pauses for a moment
why did you come to my house last night
i dont know
oh no i think you do
i made a mistake
i shouldnt have come
youre a fucking coward
im just trying to do the right thing with veronica
im trying to change
well you never changed for me
to be honest you didnt really let me
all i did was wait for you to grow up
i rooted for you i fucking paid for everything i did everything for you
yeah and i was never your equal
and you know what
i think you preferred it that way
well i know my success was never easy for you
and how do you define success celeste
because you dont look very successful right now
and you are
pretending to be a father
pretending to be an adult
what do you want
i just want you to admit that youre wrong
wrong about what
what did you want me to do
wait for you to meet someone first
is that how you saw it happening
celeste doesnt respond
i didnt expect to meet someone so fast but i did
and i think we have a chance to be happy together
i dont want to blow that
you know what jesse
you definitely will blow it
jesse takes a beat
i feel really sorry for you
you might be alone forever
he starts to walk away
celeste call after him
dont ever call me
dont worry about it
jesse walks away
skillz and celeste sit in her backyard and watch the last scene from dirty dancing
the image is being projected onto her garden wall
there is no sound
instead bob marleys kaya plays over the speakers
celeste is ripping an enormous bowl from a four foot bong
skillz is on his knees bracing the bong looking at celeste with admiration
celeste watches the movie
shes so sad
i dont think so
no shes sad
i can tell
i went to dance camp
we see jennifer grey elevated above patrick swayze looking elated
celeste exhales a huge billow of smoke
thats the first good thing thats happened to me in months
shitll get better
you dont know that
celeste grabs a handful of cheetos from an economy sized bag
how could he do this to me
hes not doing anything to you
you wanted a divorce
but i didnt want it like this
when we are no longer able to change a situation we are challenged to change ourselves
its victor frankl
skillz gets up
i gotta go before petco closes
you have a pet
no but i gotta get a toy for this girls cat you know so shell give up the kitty
can i come
will you bring me some panda express
do you think the obamas are really in love
ill pick you up at noon
beth and tuckers pre wedding bbq
hey easy on the herb until then
that shit is powerful
celeste is sitting alone wearing sunglasses and uncharacteristically colorful clothes that dont match
like a crazy lady jumpsuit
she is going to town on a huge plate of food chicken wings fries burger hot dog coleslaw egg salad and a beer
she attacks it like its her last meal ever
shes also trashed
celeste gets up and heads towards a group of people talking including beths mom beth and a couple of her girlfriends
hi honey you remember eileen from
do you have any more of that ranch dressing
its the fucking booooooomb
beth is embarrassed
celeste gives beths mom carol very large a big sloppy hug
beths getting married
i was married remember
these guys are in for a fucking dogfight right
beth pulls celeste away
lets get you a soda
they get to the bar
do you guys have any tequila
we only have mimosas and shandys
ill have both please
beth pulls celeste away from the bar and brings her into the house and plops her down on the couch
im going to recommend some quiet time for you right now
can i smoke
celeste starts weeping
i dont want to be alone forever
not forever honey
just until you sober up
youll be fine
okay then ill just go to the other side of the pool
i promise i wont make you look bad
jesse and veronica are talking to beth
in the foreground celeste slowly floats into frame on a raft in the pool passed out face down sunglasses half off fully clothed
skillz approaches beth
at least shes quiet now
im gonna get her out of here
beth has tons of barneys new york bags and is trying on clothes for her rehearsal dinner
celeste is in the fetal position hungover on beths bed
on the phone hey riley its celeste
i just want to talk to you about this error in your logo
im so so sorry i will fix this
i just think its corny to wear white two nights in a row
i want to rock a pattern or maybe something in pastel
she turns to celeste in a dress
im leaving in an hour and i have to make a decision now
you owe me
you humped my grandmother yesterday
celeste is comatose
oh no are you okay
what the fuck does riley banks know
shes a tart
shes fucking moderately talented blessed with a good face and has maybe more years left of stardom
who is she to tell me what
celeste looks at her blackberry and realizes she never hung up on riley
she hangs up quick and throws the blackberry across the bed
i never hung up i never hung up
do you think she
her blackberry rings
she takes a deep breath
she picks all casual
hey riley whats up
i need to talk to you
come to my house
celeste bursts in with all types of nervous energy
the thing is i have been having a really hard time in my life everything is sort of falling apart and when you said that thing about contempt and investigation
it just sort of hit a nerve and
just shut up for a minute
riley is in tears
i just found out my boyfriend cheated on me
god im sorry
i didnt even know you had a boyfriend
he didnt want anybody to know
fucking ass hole
and now my career might be over because you put a penis in my logo
thank you for that
riley is clearly destroyed
i didnt know who to call
celeste gives riley a big hug
so you called the smartest person you know
riley smiles through her tears
riley is asleep on the couch with a blanket over her
celeste is up watching great sports moments of on espn classic
it is a recap of matthias steiners olympic weight lifting triumph after his wife died
celeste is crying
this wakes riley up
are you crying
celeste turns off the television
oh yeah this just reminds me of someone
you miss him
yeah i do
they all fucking suck
so it never gets better
no it doesnt
but you do
youre gonna be fine
celeste is runs into a dry cleaners
she is out of breathe
the long line of impatient people to see this dragon breather who has broke the silence
she looks at her watch
she stands diligently in line
celestes phone rings loudly
she picks it up
i know i wont
no im on the road already
of course ill be there
love you too
she hangs up and was clearly lying
she must do something
something she does not want to do
she looks at the stoic woman in front of her
im so sorry but i am the maid of honor and i am supposed to be at the wedding real far away would you mind if i just got in
front of you
the woman reluctantly waves her to pass
thank you so much i really do appreciate
a disinterested man barely acknowledges celeste
im incredibly late for this wedding and my dress is here is there any way
he moves aside
the next man just stares at her
im sure you heard me ask the last guy but
the camera pulls out
a wide shot of celeste imprisoned by her own rules asking every person to cut
it looks tedious and ridiculous
she pushes ignore
celeste chain smokes
she makes up songs about how shitty the traffic is
she laughs uncontrollably
she just screams
celeste sits at a window counter
she looks out onto a small street in the center of town
she unwraps her sandwich from noisy wax paper
its really quiet in the deli
she sees a group of wedding guests outside
she waves back
the wedding is under way
i now pronounce you husband and wife
tucker and beth kiss
everybody explodes in applause
we see celeste in the audience clapping
she looks beat down and tired
three girls with no stage presence are giving a speech
they are trading off rhyming couplets
she pursued her love of spanish men but missed her tucker more than just as a friend
and our princess returned home to her loving prince and theyve been together ever since
we love you bethy
the audience applauds
celeste rolls her eyes
and now were gonna hear from celeste beths best friend in the world
a little more applause
celeste has completely forgotten she was supposed to speak
she gets up slowly and grabs the mike
thanks a lot girls that was so
there are no words
well this is gonna sound bad but i actually forgot that i was speaking tonight
beth looks at her frozen
i dont where to start
how do you get a nun pregnant
you fuck her
beths father laughs uncontrollably
hes the only one laughing
man it was much longer than i thought to get to big sur from los angeles on a friday afternoon
stellar call on having a destination wedding the weekend before th of july
busiest travel day of the year
so thanks for that mrs
wedding guests look uncomfortable
but the truth is i would go anywhere for beth
shes my best friend
and im so happy for her
senior year of college we had a tradition
every sunday come rain or shine beth and tucker would meet me and jesse at the bishop with a pack of miller high life the champagne of beers and we
would meet to talk about what was important in the world you know heideggers influence on hip hop
or the feminist duality on melrose place
lifes big questions
beth and tucker were just friends then but there was always something there
just an ease they had with each other
jesse and i spent years trying to get them together unsuccessfully
but we all remained friends and watched as tucker dated the most slutty vacuous and vile girls on the planet
for five long years
finally he removed his head from his ass and saw what was in front of him
and that was beautiful beth
and none of us could be happier about it they were perfect
wedding guests clap
they think its over
celeste looks at jesse in the crowd
veronica is next to him
jesse and i are getting a divorce
yeah our timing was not as good i guess
beth and tucker you are lucky to be best friends
work hard and respect that
it doesnt come easily
be patient dont always think youre right
and if you are it doesnt fucking matter anyway
fight for it everyday i wish i had
celeste is holding a small plate of food
jesse sidles up to her
i know this may not the best time to talk about this
at some point we will have to talk about tuckers dance moves
insert of tucker dancing on the dance floor
its shocking how terrible it is
he is so special
not as special as that poem
that those girls did
he takes a beat
your speech was really
i meant it
you know what else is beautiful
celeste picks up a baby gerkin from her plate and starts to jerk it off as she and jesse did earlier and as they have done many times
oh god tug it
jesse starts to participate
he dips his finger in the creme fraiche and puts it on the top of the gerkin
jesse and celeste are in hysterics
just then veronica arrives
celeste and jesse stop like two children who just got caught
what are you doing
he looks at celeste for cover
she is giddy wasted and happy to explain
oh jesse and i do this thing where we find the littlest thing that resembles a penis and we just you know
celeste and jesse demonstrate for veronica
celeste looks up and realizes how dumb this must seem
i dont get it
celeste and jesse stop
veronica is looking at celetes food
oh the foods out
to celeste see you on the dance floor
watch out for tucker though
they leave celeste standing alone smiling
she bites into the carrot
we see a raucous wedding dance floor
everyones dancing beth tucker their families their friends jesse veronica scott etc
they are doing wedding dances
celeste sits at her table watching with a smile
it is bittersweet for her
she drinks a martini
celeste and paul are playing scrabble and drinking wine
keeping score on a notepad so thats points plus bonus points for using all my tiles so
wait wait wait
i think i may have to challenge
thats not a word thats my hoochie cousins name
are you challenging or not
yes i definitely am
well i will tell you that zooecia is a sac secreted by a compound organism but here you go
he hands her the scrabble dictionary look for yourself
celeste finds the word reads the definition and silently accepts defeat
i go again
ive never lost a game of scrabble in my life
well nothing lasts forever
celeste and paul are making out on the couch
im so sorry i beat you in scrabble
no youre not
youre right im not
the making out gets a little hotter
celeste is aggressive
will you get a condom
i dont think we should
no youre using a condom
no i dont think we should sleep together
celeste pulls away from him
i dont know
are you not into it
no no believe me im into it
then whats the deal
i really like you
right im confused
why not sleep with me then
because i think i might really like you
further realizing oh
well i like you too
celeste looks distant
celeste is at a loud trendy club
she sits next to riley
they have to shout to be heard
celeste looks around at lots of men grinding each other with whistles in their mouth and drinks in their hands
celeste just looks at her like oh you poor sheltered disney princess
are you serious
still nothing from riley
riley looks around and takes it in
celeste looks out amongst the crowd
just then two beefy waxed tanned well groomed gay men walk up to celeste
excuse me can you please tell your friend riley that we worship her
omg shes so pretty
celeste notices that they are both wearing the riley banks t shirts made for pre teens with the cock in the butt mistake in the logo
she points at it
wait are you aware that the logo is
a dick in a butt
all of our friends are rocking it
its like the gay izod
the gay man points to a group of his friends on the dance floor all wearing riley banks gear some of them have even made their own t shirts with
the cock in the butt logo magnified
wow so what you just buy the biggest size they make
how dare you im a size in tween
i have a slight frame
they walk away offended
celeste turns to riley
she is being adored by gay men
celeste has a big idea
celeste is hiking alone on the phone energized
tweens dont want her anymore
but the gays do
ten percent of americans are gay scott
youre gay start thinking gay
she could be lady gaga by the end of the year
wow you might have just turned the cock in the butt around
we will make the cock in the butt work for us
the cock in the butt will be huge
just then a mom and two small children walk by her overhear her dirty mouth and glare at her
she waves at them self consciously
celeste is shopping for a dresser
she is talking to a salesperson
so it comes with directions and its actually really easy to assemble
look you do not know me
i do not want to assemble
trust me you do not want me to assemble
bad things happen
could i just take the floor model
ill hook you up
lemme go ask my manager
celeste is browsing and spots veronica with a shopping cart filled with baby stuff
she approaches her
of course yeah hi
what are you doing
oh im getting a dresser
oh you know getting
beth is uh
throwing me a baby shower
so i have to register
celeste swallows this
and so helpful right now
laughs nervously well looks like youre really organized
youll do great
i hope so
they share an awkward moment
listen i never got a chance to just tell you im so sorry about all this
trust me i didnt expect
theres nothing to apologize for
im the one whos sorry
i mean i dug through your trash
look i dont blame you
this has all been so weird
everything happened really fast
yeah it did
but everything will work out
i know it
jesses book is coming out
hes so talented
yeah he is
an awkward silence
well good luck
nice to see you
they both steer their carts towards each other in opposite directions but bump right into each other
oh its okay
celeste and paul are in a private karaoke room
paul is belting his heart out singing boyz ii men on bended knee
celeste is loving it
she has her own mike and pipes in once in a while with a harmony
can somebody tell me how to get things back the way they used to be
oh god give me a reason im down on bended knee
ooohohhh ooooh ooohh ohhh
til you come back to me
im down on bended knee hee hee hee
they finish with a huge applause for themselves and toast with beers
i think were really good
no we are really good
celeste punches in the numbers for the next song
its islands in the stream made popular by kenny rogers and dolly parton
baby when i met you there was peace on earth i set out get you with a fine tooth comb
i was soft inside
what the fuck
shhh come on
you do something to me that i cant explain hold me closer and i feel no pain
tender love is blind it requires a dedication
celeste and paul sing in harmony
honest love we feel needs honest love we feel needs conversation
and we ride it conversation
and we ride it it together uh huh
it together uh huh
celeste slowly drops her mike
paul is still singing
quietly i cant
come on were so good together
islands in the stream that is what we are
get in there
this is my favorite part
i know im pitchy but im finding it
sail away with me
paul slowly drops his mike
what do you mean
are you serious
he sits down on the couch
the music is still playing in the background
i think i need to be alone
im not ready
im having fun and i feel like im beginning to like you and i just dont think im ready for that
celeste doesnt say anything
wow youre breaking my heart
im so sorry
you are so
but im getting divorced
celeste i know
i think i need to go through this alone
i respect that
live by will not by force
youre only ready when youre ready you know
dont force it
its just some yoga shit
but i do like you
i like you a lot
and when you are ready if youre ready call me
celeste and jesse sit across from each other with their respective lawyers
they are both dressed very well
the atmosphere is formal tense
there is not a lot of talking but there is a lot of loud paper shuffling and ball point pens
celestes lawyer male speaks sign here
celeste looks up makes eye contact with jesse and smiles uncomfortably
celeste is still signing
she looks at jesse again who is straightening his tie
i like that tie
oh thank you
one more here
is it made out of organic mung beans
jesse nods and chuckles
no i actually found it digging through your trash
ohhh i see
theyve broken the tension
but its still silent
then jesse chortles
it sounds like a baby pig
it makes celeste laugh
now both celeste and jesse are silently cracking up doubled over as their lawyers sit there watching them perplexed
celeste and jesse walk out of the building
they high five
what are you supposed to do when you get divorced
we did it
you wanna walk for a couple minutes
celeste and jesse are now approaching the front of urban light the installation from the beginning of the movie
the street lamps are now illuminated
she takes a seat on a step
jesse sits next to her
she refers to the lamps these are beautiful
i thought you hated them
yeah well ive never seen them at night
jesse looks at the lamps and takes them in
he looks pretty sad
whats up with you
i know we just got divorced but no one died right
im just feeling like maybe you were right
i am a fuck up
i dont know what im doing
my girlfriend left
there is a long pause
she wanted me to tell her everything was gonna be okay and i couldnt
i dont know why but i just
she wants to go back to brussels
another monumental pause
jesses eyes start tearing up
okay you can say it now
you were right i blew it
just say it
dont do that
you are not a loser
you never were
you took a chance
i admire that and i believe in you
and i want to thank you
for never being the person i wanted you to be
oh youre welcome
go get her
but i dont know if everything is gonna be all right
well who does
do you love her
jesse looks at celeste
then its worth fighting for
celeste smiles with tears in her eyes
god i finally understand why you fucking cry all the time
shit is emotional
they share a laugh
then they sit in silence for a beat
you deserve to be happy
and i wish that for you always
i guess we were right
celeste makes the c and j hand gesture from the high school photo in the opening montage
jesse makes it back
i love you
he kisses her on the lips
for the last time
and then hes gone
i love you too
celeste sits awhile and looks up at the sky
celeste drives and dials a number on her bluetooth
so youre probably giving your card to some girl in yoga right now
but if that doesnt work out for you
i think i may be ready
to beat you in scrabble
celeste runs in to pay for gas
she is on her blackberry
celeste stands in line with some gum and water
a young man blatantly cuts in front of her with a gallon of water
old celeste returns for a moment
excuse me sir
the young man turns around
celeste realizes shes no longer this person
she restrains herself
celeste takes in how she has changed
she smiles a little
the young man turns back to her
hey im sorry for cutting
my dogs in the car and hes really thirsty
she smiles again
the world feels bigger now
