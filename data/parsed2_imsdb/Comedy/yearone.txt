written by harold ramis gene stupnitsky lee eisenberg october th black an infinite void but at the center a singularity a particle infinitely small and infinitely dense that contains all
the potential matter and energy in the universe
a blinding flash of light as the singularity explodes particles expanding in all directions until they fill the screen a shimmering cloud of electromagnetic dust
then the particles start to attract one another to form atoms the atoms elements the elements form molecules the molecules compounds the compounds cells then a cell twitches and a
primitive drum starts booming out a dolby heartbeat as we witness the rapid evolution of organisms
then a big fish swims by and is suddenly swallowed whole by a much bigger fish and we rapidly rise from the depths and pull back to reveal vast blue
rolling toward the shore brilliant sun rising in a cloudless azure sky
a woman emerges from the sea like aphrodite strongly backlit to obscure her nudity but we can see she is full breasted long limbed toned and tanned perfection
then a man rises up out of the water beside her and staggers clumsily in the surf
even in silhouette we can see hes far from perfect short overweight
they turn to each other and embrace
its paradise for him
looking deep in his eyes im so hungry
wanting her yeah
the drums get hotter as he closes his eyes and leans in to kiss her but she turns and walks away
what should we eat
oh you actually meant you were hungry
i thought forget it
he follows her
they walk toward the trees that fringe the beach
when they reach the line of vegetation the woman maya kneels pulls berries from a bush and pops them in her mouth
the man zed grabs a handful of berries and they squat there noshing like adam and eve
mmmm these are so good
mmrrunm they really are
when she turns away he spits them out in disgust
maya smiles and puts her face very close to his their lips almost touching
very sexy you know what id really like
frustrated but hanging yeah fruits good
he stands up you want an apple or a pear
he scans the nearby trees
she shakes her head umm mango
she shakes her head coyly
he starts darting from tree to tree hopefully pointing out various options
she follows him
zed contd plum
fake smile okay dont tell me papaya
the game is no longer cute but he still plays along
this is a lot of work to get laid starfruit casaba tangelo
he doesnt even like her okay i give up
which fruit do you want
its a beautiful tree with lush apple like red fruit hanging from it
because thats the fruit we dont eat
because we dont
its a rule
thats the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
you dont eat from that one
nobody ever has
stop saying why not
i told you its a rule
so do you always follow the rules
no yeah i dont know
we dont have that many rules
in fact we only have one rule dont eat that okay fine
forget i mentioned it
i understand if youre afraid im not afraid no really its all right
i just thought you might be curious why we can eat everything else that walks crawls swims flies or grows in the ground but not that particular fruit
and i thought you might be the kind of man whos willing to take a chance and start thinking for himself but i guess i was wrong
she glares defiantly at zed then starts to walk away
its not paradise anymore
then like every man that ever lived and will ever live he caves
you want to try the good and evil fruit you got it
he rips two ripe fruits from a low hanging bough and hands her one
they both stare at the fruit
it was your idea
you go first
we both bite at the same time
zed considers for a long moment then decides
one two three
zed chomps down hard and takes a big bite but maya fakes him out and stops before her teeth break the skin
zed contd with his mouth full got me
thats a good move
im going to steal it
he starts chewing and she watches as he gets his first taste of good and evil
then his face contorts in disgust and he spits it out
zed contd gagging and spitting yuchh
he frantically wipes the inside of his mouth with his fingers trying to get the terrible taste out
so youre saying its not good
im saying its not good
he grabs his belly as his stomach starts to cramp
then a loud bowel sound and his eyebrows shoot up
zed contd oh no
official white he runs for the bushes
mayas attention gets diverted
noticing something ooh banana
a tribe of primitive caucasians
dozens of huts surround a mmunal fire pit where women in loincloths roll flatbread co and cook it on heated rocks
the drums start pounding out a celebratory rhythm as the hunters enter carrying a dead boar on a pole their faces marked with boars blood ritual signs in honor of
the lead hunter marlak is a hulking thug with a bony neanderthal forehead
he cuts off the boars head and drops it at mayas feet
blunt grunt for you
forces a grateful smile thank you marlak
zed is lying on a pad of animal hides in front of his hut his guts still aching
his best friend oh sits next to him sewing skins together watching the hunters with envy jealous of the attention theyre getting from the women
if zed is over confident and reckless oh is his polar opposite nervous and risk averse the kind of guy who would apologize if you poked him in the ass
with your spear
he may in fact be near sighted and if glasses had been invented hed be wearing them
look at them
hunters think theyre so cool
they dont think gathering is dangerous
there are thorns bees those big stingy ants
i could hunt i just dont want to
and whats with the blood on their faces
they think thats sanitary
miserable with pain do me a favor
just kill me
why did you eat that fruit
everybody knows that
i couldnt help myself
maya was just staring at me with those pouty eyes and those perky breasts opposable thumbs
and how about the name
the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
you dont think that sounds tempting
they shouldve just called it the tree with the fruit that tastes like shit
then for sure nobody would eat it
zed notices a villager squatting in the bushes right behind his dwelling
zed contd shouts testily hey
give me a break would ya
you got the whole forest
to oh why does everyone have to crap right behind my hut
i think and i could be wrong that all the poop makes the ground more fertile which in turn gives the leaves in the area a softer feel
its a vicious circle
oh notices a very pretty young woman eema standing near the communal fire with two hunters
his heart leaps
oh contd calls out eagerly hi eema
eema turns sees its him and gives him a perfunctory wave then turns back to the hunters and says something about oh that makes them laugh
oh contd she doesnt even know i exist
i want to lay with her so badly
i dont see it
i mean shes cute but i dont think id lay with her
of course not
shes your sister
itd be like sleeping with your mother
which was a big mistake
i see that now
you think it wont be awkward the next morning but trust me you just want to rip your eyeballs out
shakes off the memory listen if you want to impress eema tonight at the feast do the fertility dance with her then drag her back to your hut
my huts a mess
and what if she struggles
so you give her a little tap on the head
women respond to that no
she only likes hunters not gatherers
they look over at eema who is now slowly stroking the shaft of a hunters spear
i wouldnt read too much into that
she kisses then tongues the spear tip
zed contd okay that might mean something
the hunter marlak walks by and stops
hes clearly half a rung lower on the human evolutionary scale
you didnt hunt today
i was indisposed
got that intestinal thing thats been going around
marlak grunts and examines the primitive line drawings on the walls of zeds hut
points at a drawing whats that supposed to be
its a bear
thats not a bear
thats just some lines on a skin
its not a real bear
its a representation of a bear
you know a picture
like youd know
and whats that
he picks up a skin with another of zeds drawings on it this one of a big breasted naked girl
zed quickly grabs it and holds it upside down
that would be an antelope or a deer a deerpalope
trying to look at it upside down it looks like maya
hides it away how could it be maya
its just some lines on a skin
stay away from my woman
im not sure dragging her into the bushes kicking and screaming means you have an actual thing going
marlak cuffs him hard on the side of the head
walking off stay away
calls after him hey
nice supra orbital ridge fartface
the drums kick up another notch as the huge boar roasts on a spit over a roaring fire
the tribe is gathered around the big fire pit
the tribes shaman their medicine man and spirit leader dances around the fire in a boars head mask accessorized with way too many bones beads and feathers
zed and oh are sitting near the fire smoking something in a long decorated pipe
did it ever occur to you that there may be more to life than this
taking the pipe from zed okay i think somebodys had enough
no im serious
were born into thisworld we hunt we gather we eat we sleep we make babies you make babies but why
whats the point
you always get like this when you smoke
oh takes a big toke on the pipe chokes and starts coughing uncontrollably
last night i couldnt sleep so i just laid there looking up at the sky counting the stars
there were over seventy
kinda makes you think doesnt it
looks up at the sky no
ive been thinking about it ever since i ate that fruit
dont you ever wonder whats on the other side of the mountains
theres nothing on the other side of the mountains
everybody knows that
the world just ends
youd fall right off the edge
makes a sharp gesture but what if it doesnt
what if it just goes on and on forever
or what if its round
he picks up a round and if you keep walking you eventually come right back to where you started
he traces the circumference with his finger
oh yeah thats plausible
zed flings the rock away
waves apologetically sorry
tries to cheer him up will you stop with that crazy talk
were at a feast
you love feasts
theres women theres boar meat theres an assortment of berries theres women oh looks over at eema
zed picks up on it
do it man
go dance for her
theyre playing the jackal dance
i dont do that one so well
are you kidding
oh summons his courage gets up and crosses to where the girls are sitting
zed makes subtle eye contact with maya waggles his eyebrows and licks his lips
she laughs and looks away
oh starts dancing timidly right in front of eema subtly jerking his pelvis trying to be cool
eema just stares at him for a moment then goes back to talking to her friends
oh looks over at zed for help
zed mimes clonking her on the head
oh picks up a wooden club and hits eema right on the noggin
however instead of submitting she gets really pissed stands up and decks him with one punch
eema glowers at zed who feigns innocence
a hunter is slicing off hunks of boar meat for the other tribesmen
zed pushes through the small crowd waiting for food and goes to the front
excuse me hunter coming through
wait your turn
theres a line here buddy
for your information i was in line and i just stepped out to chew some food for an elderly lady
suddenly a spear is thrust inches from his face stopping him
its marlak who towers over zed
his cohort enmebaragesi short and stout stands beside him
enmebaragesi said he saw you in the garden with maya
and what if i called enmebaragesi a liar
id kill you
i said what if it was a hypothetical
marlak gets right in zeds face
enmebaragesi doesnt lie
villagers gather around them maya and eema among them
marlak puts his spear point to zeds throat
marlak contd the truth
zed just admit it
youre just making it harder on yourself
instantly annoyed no you just made it harder on myself
to marlak okay fine you got me
gingerly moves the spear maya and i lay together on occasion
were consenting adults and we have an adventurous sexual relationship
maya looks shocked and tries to signal zed to shut up
you laid with my woman
isnt that what were talking about
maya rolls her eyes
no i saw you eat the forbidden fruit
i did eat the fruit
i was just kidding about humping maya
marlak knocks zed to the ground
the drumming stops
oh comes running over and gets between marlak and zed
whats going on
marlak growls at him
oh contd quickly looks up at the oooh shooting star
zed gets to his feet
look marlak this is crazy
youre two of me
im not gonna fight you over a girl okay
zed starts to walk away but quickly pivots and throws a wild haymaker at marlak who easily ducks it and it hits an unsuspecting enmebaragesi squarely in the nose
zed contd to enmebaragesi and let that be a lesson to your big friend marlak grabs zed lands two solid punches to zeds mid section and then clocks him with
a vicious right that sends him sprawling to the ground
standing over zed your father was a great hunter but youre like a girl
the hunters laugh
good one marlak
now i kill you
hes about to spear zed when suddenly the shaman screams and jumps between them
the villagers step back as the shaman howls an incantation and shakes his magic rattle at zed
leaning close to zed we need to talk
zed and the shaman sit side by side on a log talking privately
the shaman is covered in skins feathers bones beads animal teeth antlers and horns his hair a mass of long muddy dreadlocks his face painted his cheeks nose and ears
pierced by shards of bone
but if not for his outlandish getup zed could be talking to his pastor
you really ate the fruit
whats the big deal
halfheartedly shakes a chicken foot rattle at you dont eat the fruit
thats been the number one rule from the beginning of time
since the great turtle climbed from the sea with the earth on his back drank the ocean pooped out the mountains and the first man fell from the stars
ive always had trouble with the great turtle theory too many unexplained gaps
youre screwed now
like i knew it was a rule but im a little fuzzy on the exact details
youre cursed man and if you stay here then well all be cursed
you have to leave
where am i supposed to go
up to you
from now on youre completely on your own
zed contd am i detecting a little jealousy here because i now have the knowledge of good and evil and you dont
well you know what
i say what i did was a good thing a very very good thing and im not leaving
what do you think of that
a human skull comes flying in from off camera and lands at his feet
zed contd okay is that supposed to be funny
he stands up and we see that the whole tribe is standing around them in a wide circle
marlak bangs his spear on the edge of his animal hide shield starting a rhythmical beat
the other hunters join in keeping the beat staring at zed with lethal intent to zed re the hunters you should probably get going now
you better take this knife
he hands him a flint knife with a leather wrapped handle
shaman contd and some of the guys got together and they want you to have this bow
he hands him a strong hunters bow
i dont want to seem ungrateful or anything but you wouldnt happen to have any arrows would you
an arrow zips in and sticks in the post next to his head
to zed youd better get moving
zed looks around at his fellow villagers trying to summon what dignity he has left
okay but before i go i just want to say something
i know im not the greatest hunter official white
or gatherer yes or gatherer but theres got to be more to life than this to hunters kinda hard to concentrate with that rhythmic drumming fellas
the hunters keep the insistent beat their gaze fixed on zed
zed contd rolls his eyes these guys are hopeless anyways im going away not because youre forcing me to which you are but because i choose to
yes i ate from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil major misunderstanding on my part and believe me im not recommending it unless youre interested in a
very powerful laxative but it got me thinking about some pretty heavy stuff life questions you know
so im out of here and anyone who wants to join me is welcome
he looks around the circle and sees maya
she sees marlak staring at her and averts her eyes
zed contd zed looks at oh who suddenly becomes very interested in an imaginary piece of loincloth lint
zed contd looks directly at oh i dont know where were going or when were going to get there but i will lead the way he picks up a burning
lighting up the darkness pointing us in the right direction and keeping us entertained with humorous anecdotes from my childhood
now whos with me
he enthusiastically thrusts the torch in the air
oh looks at eema then at zed and lowers his eyes
zed contd okay then i guess ill just have to go it alone which is fine with to oh better in fact because having a partner would just slow me
oh cant look at him
zed shakes his head failing to notice that the torch hes holding has ignited the roof of the hut next to him
the shaman shouts and points at the now blazing roof
zed contd oops
they all stare as the fire quickly leaps from roof to roof
zed contd i know theres a lesson in here somewhere
the villagers scream and run off to try and save their huts
raises his spear to zed now you die
marlak throws his spear and misses as zed takes off running into the forest with the hunters right behind him and the whole village ablaze
zed runs for his life through the dense forest
the hunters chase him shooting arrows at him on a dead run
zed dodges as the arrows zip around him
he veers left then right then trips and tumbles down a muddy embankment
the hunters stop at the top of the embankment
marlak listens for sounds of movement in the forest below then silently signals for the hunters to fan out
marlak nimbly makes his way down the embankment reaches the bottom and sees something in the moonlight
its zed lying on the ground badly camouflaged with sticks and leaves thinking he cant be seen but the shape of his body is clearly discernible
marlak raises his spear
i see you
long beat no you dont
yes i do
how can you see me if im not here
youre trying to trick me
okay then tell me this whos standing right behind you
nobodys fool you think im going to turn around and look but im not
pulls his knife im going to gut you like a pig
he is about to plunge his knife into zed when suddenly he is struck from behind by a heavy tree branch
he falls heavily knocked senseless by oh who is standing over him with the makeshift club
zed sits up and smiles gratefully at oh
i guess im with you
was it my speech
no the fire
i lost everything
but the speech was pretty good right
i mean even i was moved and i was the one speaking
can we talk about this later
oh pulls zed to his feet and they sneak off into the deep woods
zed and oh walk through the moonlit forest
this is nice out here the two of us
yeah its great
come on those hunters are idiots
in an hour theyll forget the whole thing
i dont think theyll forget the fire
you know what we should do
you and me should kill the biggest boar ever just huge
and take it back to the village
just to show them
and we wont let anyone else eat it
theyll have to watch us eat it
if its that huge how would we carry it back
fine well just start with something small
a squirrel or something
yeah well make everyone watch us eat a squirrel
will you get real
theres no going back
theres nothing to go back to
its just ashes
yeah like its so hard to build a new hut
its just a pile of sticks and dung youre a pile of sticks and dung
suddenly zed stops and stands perfectly still
through clenched teeth oh
what are you doing
zed makes a minimal gesture with his head
oh looks up
a cougar crouches on a tree limb above them poised to leap
they talk like ventriloquists
dont move a muscle
will that work
without moving his lips i dont know
theres two different opinions on this one
some say run some say dont
what are you going to do
im going to run
he sprints off and the cougar pounces right on oh
zed is holding a stick over the fire cooking what looks like a squirrel or a muskrat
oh comes out of the forest carrying a huge armload of sticks and branches
one of ohs sticks falls and as he carefully reaches down to grab it the rest spill out on the ground
his body is covered with long claw marks
you really should put some maggots on those scratches
they look pretty deep
i just want to know why you told me not to move and you ran
because i honestly thought hed go for me
i thought i was doing you a favor
apparently not appreciated
yeah big favor
you didnt have to come with me you know
i didnt ask you to come
yes you did
you looked right at me twice
yes thats a technique of public speaking but i didnt ask you specifically
you chose to come
you gotta take some responsibility for that
and theres no point coming if youre just gonna keep whining about every little cougar that attacks you
pulls the cooked rodent from the fire you want some or not
no eat your weasel
you deserve it
he turns his back to zed and starts sorting through the pile of sticks
you making your own fire
were going to need them
perks up youre still coming
zed claps him on the back and hugs him exuberantly
oh winces in pain
zed and oh are hiking uphill the lush dense verdure of the forest now thinning to evergreens and mountain heather
zed and oh climbing higher now
finally they reach the top and look out at the vista
from their vantage point they can see a high plateau and wooded land stretching far beyond it
i knew it
still think youre just gonna fall off the edge of the world
in amazement incredible
he takes a step forward the rock shelf gives way beneath his feet and he falls a great distance screaming all the way down bouncing painfully off the big boulders
then a long tumbling slide over sharp rocks and gravel to the bottom
then calls out ill go around
wait for me
zed is following a trail downhill through the forest on the other side of the mountains
oh is limping along behind him bitten clawed cut scraped and bruised
say what you want but that was no accident
you dont see a pattern here
i see a pattern
every time something terrible can happen to me it does
yeah but why
whyd the cougar go for you and not me
why did you fall and i didnt
hard to believe its all just random
think about j avdganly mi i ia htinti
f inwrom m w looks around the forest clearing for subtle signs
zed contd sniffing the air people more than one walking he guesses that way
looking around you think
theres about a thousand footprints here
he indicates the heavily trampled forest floor
ignores him yes
he drops to one knee and examines something in the bushes
zed contd they stopped here to poop
no thank you
four men maybe five
and a child or a small women maybe
a little disgusted okay
poking at the evidence looks like they had some nuts dried fruit some kind of green leafy vegetable okay
can we just go
maybe we can find where they peed
then zed sees light through the trees and creeps stealthily to the tree line
oh creeps up beside him and they peer through the bushes
three cows are grazing in a green pasture
beyond it well tended fields of growing grain
zed snaps into stalking mode ducks down and silently signals oh to be quiet and stay put
this ones mine
he takes his bow pulls an arrow from his quiver and slowly draws the bow taking deadly aim at one of the cows
the blunt pointless arrow hits the cow in the side and bounces off
the cow looks up
zed contd to oh were gonna need some arrowheads
zed draws his flint knife then suddenly bursts out of the forest dashes toward the cow and leaps on its back
oh comes running up as the cow bucks and sends zed flying
lying on the ground zed looks up and sees two surprised young farmers dressed in simple white woolen tunics staring at him
did you just shoot my cow
getting painfully to his yeah well were hunters
covering for himself hes a hunter
im more of a maker
i made this loincloth i do arrows i made a shelf unit for my hut what do you guys do
what does it look like
hes a farmer im a herdsman
youre a suck is what you are
ignores him my brother cain
i am called abel
you are called suck
my brother is angry because god looked on my sacrifice with favor
mimics him god looked on my sacrifice with to oh okay is he a total suck or what
well its hard to say we just why are you dragging them into this
what do they know
to abel you think youre so superior to everyone else
superior er than you
lets see how good you are at getting your ass kicked
shoves him yeah
shoves him back okay boys thats enough
we just want to wont let it go no
this smug asshole insulted you and i want him to take it back
were not really that insulted pushes abel hard take it back
pushes back make me
zed steps between them trying to make peace
lets just relax and cain uses the distraction to sneak punch abel and the fight is on
they start throwing wild punches then clinch and wrestle each other to the ground
shouldnt we do something
just let them settle it
cain picks up a good size rock and strikes abel on the head with all his might
abel falls heavily to the ground and lies there not moving
cain stands over him breathing hard
zed contd i guess that settles it
turns on him sharply still holding the bloody what
cain stares at abel still inert on the ground
hes all right
probably just humoring him probably just tuckered out from the fight
looking around nervously yeah
cain contd maybe i should throw some dirt on him keep him warm til he wakes up
he starts kicking dirt over abels body
cain contd getting worried this is bad
this is really bad
were in serious trouble
what do you mean we
i dont want to play the blame game but youre the one who hit him
turns on them you couldve stopped me
theres two of you and only one of me
we didnt know you were going to kill him you calling me a murderer
he clutches the rock did i say that
it was an accident
to oh right
you were holding the rock and he accidentally ran into it really hard with his head
calming down okay yeah good
but it might be better if we dont mention the accident to anyone
people might get the wrong idea
oh yeah people could so easily misinterpret that
why even bring it up
i like you guys
youre all right
why dont you come with me
have supper with the family
unfortunately we already have dinner plans
i think you should come with me
his idea why dont we go with you
cain finishes loading bushels of grain onto an oxcart while zed and oh closely inspect the big heavy solid wooden wheels on the cart
what are the big round things for
theyre wheels numbskull
they make the cart roll
blown away wow
that is like the greatest invention since the vagina
cain whips the oxen and they lumber forward
oh screams as the heavy wheels roll over his feet
they look really thrilled wind blowing through their hair their hands up like roller coaster riders
with them riding on it plodding slowly into a farming hamlet aa cluster of small roughly plastered mud houses with thatched roofs
adam dour hard working and long suffering but still strong and upright trudges home with a metal scythe over his shoulder
he could be max von sydow
hailing cain cain my son
cain stops the cart and dismounts with zed and oh
cain contd can these guys stay for supper
off adams questioning i bring strangers who would sojourn with us this night
cain turns to zed and oh and furtively mimes an elaborate lip sewing gesture ancient precursor to the modern lip zipper
i am called adam and you are welcome to share the fruits of our toil
thanks but im kind of staying away from fruit for the time being
zed gives cain a subtle acquiescent nod as adam ushers them into his crude dwelling
official white the rude dwelling has a stark somber almost amish feeling to it
zed and oh sit at the table sharing a simple meal youngest with adam cain and his adams wife eve and h them liliths tunic gaping open to reveal her
breasts every time she leans over to put something on the table
zed and oh cant take their eyes off her
to cain where is thy brother abel
badly overplaying abel
havent seen him
i thought he was with you
to zed and oh you guys see him
they shake their heads and cough nervously
equally unconvincing nape
not that i remember
never seen anybody anywhere anytime ever
to cain your sister lilith said she saw him in the field with you
i think that was yesterday
no this day
she said you both made offerings
that mightve been boaz no you and abel
she said it looked like you were arguing
hey were brothers we argue sometimes its not that big a deal
and his flock was untended in the okay
what am i his keeper
get off my back will you
he smashes his plate against the wall and storms out
an awkward silence as zed and oh exchange guilty looks
i fear the worst for abel
i am sorely vexed
yeah thats got to be pretty vexing
a bergmanesque gloom fills the hovel as adam muses sullenly on his sorry circumstances
for my sin the ground is cursed
thorns and thistles does it sprout for us and we are doomed to toil all the days of our lives
for as the lord has commanded by the sweat of your brow shall you get bread to eat until you return to the ground from which you were taken
for dust you are and to dust shall you return
thats kind of a downer isnt it
its the way of the world
boy i hope not
rises abruptly you are welcome to stay the night and lay with my daughter lilith
zed looks at the luscious lilith then back at adam
im waiting for the punchline
she is without a husband and as the lord has said thou shalt be fruitful and multiply
lilith nods demurely and exits through a curtain
zed starts to follow her out
what about me
you may share the bed of my son seth
yeah there you go
he exits oh looks at seth
i multiplied with a sheep
oh just stares at him my thingie smells like lamb chops
zed enters the room
lilith reclines on a cot with a straw mattress
making room on the cot my bed is small but youre welcome to share it
its the way of my people
lying down beside her and thats a good way to be
in fact im kind of surprised a pretty girl like you is sleeping alone anyway
i wouldve thought guys would be lined up at the door
i dont like men
moving closer maybe you just havent met the right one
i like girls
so we have that in common stares at him for a beat im attracted to women
a beat i dont even know what that means
what does that mean
i like to have sex with other women
stares at her for a long im really not getting this
lilith shakes her head turns away from him and pulls up her blanket
zed shrugs and rolls over to sleep
they lie there quietly in the dark for a long beat
then zed contd youre kidding
oh is lying next to seth wide awake trying to stay as far away from him as possible
oooh listen to this one
seth lifts his knees to his chest and farts a surprisingly long cadenza
thats really good
want to see a trick
do i have to
in the yard behind the house oh is helping cain as he chops firewood with a metal axe
oh now wears a tunic like the farmers
its been the same damn thing my whole life
swings the axe thwack
why cant you be more like abel
oh your sacrifice was good too but abels was wow
trying to change the your brother seth is an interesting guy
did you know he can put his penis in his mouth
adam and zed come out of his dwelling
kinsmen from other dwellings start gathering
yeah hey wheres everybody going
to look for abel
what did you say
louder mock sincerity i said good luck
im really worried about him
he turns aside and makes a goofy sarcastic face for ohs benefit
youre not coming
yeah i am
i just have to finish toiling over here then im right behind you
adam and the others hurry off and as soon as theyre gone cain rushes over and starts harnessing the oxen to the cart
cain contd to zed and oh now listen im getting out of here and you better come with me
i have a feeling theyre going to try and blame this whole abel killing thing on you
why would they blame us
because when they find him and his head is all bashed in theyre going to start pointing fingers and you guys are drifters so theyll put two and two together
and that makes he stares expectantly at zed and oh
cain contd four
it makes four
now stop asking so many questions and hop on
we gotta get out of here
he urgently whips the oxen and they climb aboard as the cart lumbers forward
adam and the other farmers discover abels body
to the others after him
the farmers shout and race back to the hamlet
adam and the other farmers jump onto two more oxcarts and set out after cain zed and oh
cains cart lumbers along
he looks back over his shoulder
urgently to zed and oh theyre gaining on us
zed and oh look back
the other oxcarts are a hundred yards back chasing them at maybe two miles per hour
cain whips his oxen and they step up the pace to mph
theyll never catch us now
an aerial view shows cains cart slowly pulling away from his pursuers
suddenly a bolt of lightning splits the bright blue sky and strikes cain right on the forehead knocking him back into the cart
he sits up stunned with a still smoking jagged burn mark on his forehead
cain contd dazed but exhilarated wow
what are the odds of that
feeling the burn mark am i lucky or what
zed and oh exchange doubtful looks and glance nervously at the sky
the ox cart approaches a small trading settlement on the seacoast a kind of makeshift tent city around a central marketplace
several dhows are tied up at the shore camels and pack animals are tethered on the fringes while traders and merchants inspect newly arrived goods and haggle over prices
zed oh and cain wander through the crowded market
people of every race dressed in all manner of exotic garb buy sell and barter goods from distant lands
zed and oh gawk like a couple of yokels
look at all these people
and this stuff
oh approaches a bakery stand and stares hungrily at the bread
to the merchant can i have one of those
he reaches for a loaf but the merchant strikes his hand with a cane
oh contd ow
two silver pieces
were gonna need some money
yeah were gonna need money
an afterthought whats money
they see a crowd at the center of the market gathered around a raised platform
slaves in shackles are lined up on the raised wooden platform while customers examine those waiting to be auctioned
the auctioneer brings up a fnuscular male slave in a loincloth
zed contd its marlak
marlaks hands are bound and hes restrained by a chain attached to a thick leather collar around his neck
addresses the crowd next up an unusual item looks like a caucasian hes big hes strong hes a good breeder so im going to start at gold minas
do i hear
as the bidding starts zed spots maya his sister eema and enmebaragesi among the chained up slaves waiting to be sold
zed and oh push their way through the crowd and go to them
amazed to see them eema
the women embrace him with relief and excitement
how did you get here
well after the fire she shoots him an accusing look the hill tribes raided the village
the men fought them but they were too many
they took us captive marched us to the sea then traded us to the boat people who brought us here
to eema are you all right
did they rape you
just a little
zed and oh look at her curiously
the slave trader sees them talking to eema and approaches
you interested in some slaves
like a prospective buyer yeah this one looks pretty good he starts prodding poking and squeezing mayas arm like hes buying fruit
oh takes the opportunity to fondle eemas breasts
she punches him
zed contd ooh feisty
so how does this work if we want them
the slave trader notes zeds peasant clothes
you have money
well that depends on what you mean by money
look pal money talks and bullshit walks
i dont have time for looky loos
cain steps up and intercedes
perhaps i can help
confidentially to zed and let me talk to the guy
maybe i can make a deal with him
you guys wait here
cain puts his arm around the slave traders shoulder and walks him away
cain contd to the slave trader so what are we lookin at here
from a distance zed and oh watch them talking but cant hear what theyre saying
to eema what an amazing coincidence running into you and maya and them
you still think its all just a coincidence
all of us here right now at this particular place at this particular time
i dont know
why do you think
im not sure yet but im starting to believe that everything happens for a reason
like why did i eat the forbidden fruit
to get laid
okay that might have been what i was thinking at the time but what if some omnipotent force put the fruit there because i was supposed to eat it
which omnipotent force
what do you mean which omnipotent force
how many omnipotent forces could there be
i dont know
whats omnipotent mean
work with me im just speculating here
lets call this force god and lets say this god is controlling everything
maybe god wanted me to have the knowledge of good and evil
why would he want that
how do you know gods a he
zed rolls his eyes
dont you get what im saying
what if weve been chosen
you think weve been chosen by god
well no offense but its possible that i was chosen and you all just happened to be there
why would god choose you
why wouldnt he choose marlak
a chosen doesnt need to be strong
im big this way
points to his temples you do have a fat face
not my face my brain
im the smartest guy in the village
youre not even im smarter than you
to another villager which one of us is smarter
youre both idiots
oh yeah then why are we free and youre chained up
because of you
calls them over hey
i think we worked something out
confidently to maya sit tight
im going to get you out of here
do you trust me
i want to trust you
she gives him an encouraging hug then zed and oh cross to cain and the slave trader
zed contd to cain good work
whats the deal
the slave owner smiles
zed and oh are dragged onto the platform in shackles and leg irons
they see cain riding off on a donkey
he holds up a bag of coins and waves goodbye
i never trusted that guy
just cause he murdered his brother and got hit by lightning
they are pushed to the front of the platform
to the crowd all right
next up is a twofer im selling them as a pair i know they dont look like much but im starting the bidding at sixty gold minas
do i hear sixty
remember its two for one here
do i hear fifty
thats only twenty five apiece folks
zed looks out at the crowd starting to get offended
slave trader contd youre breaking my heart here
how about forty
do i hear forty
to oh its not like i want to be a slave or anything but this is embarrassing
come on people
were a steal at thirty
they probably dont know how smart you think you are
finally a bedouin sheik raises his giraffe tail fly whisk and waves it at the slave trader
sold to sheikh hassan for gold minas
to zed and oh have a good time in the salt mines boys
a small caravan of camels and donkeys loaded with trade goods moves across the arid wasteland
the effete sheikh rides the lead camel protected from the blistering sun by a colorful canopy
a few armed bedouin guards ride alongside
bringing up the rear is a large four wheeled cart drawn by horses basically a cage on wheels into which twenty newly purchased slaves have been crammed jammed together like
zed and oh are in the middle of the body pile literally cheek by jowl with the other slaves barely able to move
i eema is right next to oh her body pressed tight against his
oh shifts around repositioning his arms and body trying to get more comfortable and give eema a little space but he just ends up touching her even more
excuse me im sorry his hand gets stuck between her breasts thats not good he jerks his hand away elbowing marlak in the face
marlak growls and grabs oh by the throat but the struggle forces everyone else to shift which causes even more discomfort
cut that out
zed tries to turn his head to see whos behind him
you can take your foot out of my ass anytime now
and your foot is still there
if i turn around you will be sorry
zed twists violently and manages a full turn which brings him face to face and crotch to crotch with maya
zed contd thats better
for you maybe
look i want you to know i blame myself for everything that happened
so does everybody else
over his shoulder get away from my woman
i dont think thats going to be possible
and i told you before shes not your woman
ill kill you
marlak starts muscling and squirming his way through the body pile trying to get to zed
watch it jerk
its too cramped to even throw a punch so marlak uses a random slaves head as a weapon to bang against zeds head repeatedly
suddenly zed feels marlaks hands around his neck grabbing him from behind
zed struggles but marlak manages to pull him into a full headlock forcing zeds face into his hairy armpit
oh is vaguely aware of the fight going on but cant move
calling to zed hold on
oh tries to maneuver to zed but cant move an inch
oh contd contd if everyone could just move to the right
thank you in advance for your cooperation
then giving up hope you can do it zed
use his weight against him
marlak now has zed locked in a lethal choke hold
a bedouin guard notices the commotion and bangs the bars of the cage with his staff
shouts at the slaves knock it off
dont make me come in there
id like to see you try
the bedouin is just about to respond when suddenly a metal tipped arrow flies in and pierces his throat
he drops to the sand dead
comes flying over the crest of the wadi followed by twenty armored foot soldiers wearing bronze helmets and breastplates
the soldiers attack the caravan slashing and slicing the bedouin guards
their commander sargon his helmet topped with a magnificent plume rides up in the chariot and with one mighty stroke of his sword cuts the head off another bedouin guard
marlak reaches through the bars grabs the fallen bedouins sword and hacks off the lock on the door of the slave wagon
the door flies open and the slaves tumble jump and stumble out onto the ground
zed and oh look around gawking at the massacre taking place
then zed sees marlak sword in hand looking for him
shouts an order take the slaves
marlak starts for zed but two soldiers ride up and throw a heavy restraining net over him
zed grabs oh and takes off running over the nearest sand dune
sargon watches them flee
sir shall i pursue them
let the desert have them
they wont get far
the soldiers are camped for the night
the slaves are back in their cage
sargon the commander stops to instruct the official white
tend to the slaves
we leave for sodom before daybreak
they lie hidden behind a sandy ridge watching from a short distance
i wonder who they are
their hats are really great arent they
im sorry but when that one guy cut the other guys head off my first thought wasnt gee what a great hat
it wasnt my very first thought but id be lying if i said it wasnt up there
now we just need to figure out a way to rescue maya and eema
how are we going to rescue anybody
patience my friend
even killers have to sleep sometime
he keeps a sharp wakeful eye on the enemy camp
zed and oh fast asleep on the ridge
they slowly wake up
well that was refreshing
howd you sleep
not that well
i think i was over tired
then zed suddenly remembers maya
he looks and sees that the soldiers and slaves are long gone
he leaps to his feet looks around desperately and sees nothing but a vast wasteland in every direction
now where do we go
zed sniffs the air puts his ear to the ground and tastes the sand
i have no idea
trudging across the desert in the blistering heat growing weaker stumbling and falling
too weak to move why do i listen to you
now were going to starve to death or die of thirst
will you stop being so negative
i got your back man
who saved you from those lions when you were a baby
they were going to pounce had you surrounded
took the mama lion bam
kneed her right in the face
papa lion comes flying at me bam
dropped an elbow knocked his ass out
zed contd took his legs thwoom
tossed him in the river
and the rest just ran off
you know ive asked people about that and no one else seems to remember it
yeah because nobody else was there
youre lucky i was walking by
okay its possible i dreamed that but who practically raised you after your father was dragged off by those raccoons
not a dignified death
practically delirious he was a small man
oh collapses face down in the sand
pull back to reveal that they are surrounded by hungry jackals vultures and hyenas
weve got to keep moving
hauls oh to his feet ive got you buddy just like always
he puts oh over his shoulder and stumbles on
a man in his sixties tall full beard piercing eyes and fierce nose dressed in a robe and kafiyya arranges firewood on a large flat rock
his teenage son looks around curiously
they are abraham and isaac
we making a burnt offering
as god has commanded me
i dont see the sheep
the lord will provide the sheep
abraham takes a cord and starts tying isaacs hands together
uh is this like a magic trick
without another word abraham takes strong hold of isaac and lifts him up onto the firewood
isaac contd really scared now okay if this is because i didnt clean up my tent you can stop now
i get it
then abraham pulls a long slaughtering knife from beneath his robe
isaac contd all right this isnt funny anymore
abraham raises the knife
isaac contd im telling mom
the knife flashes in the sun as it descends toward the boy
abraham and isaac both turn to see zed and oh step out from behind the rocks
their clothes are tattered and they are burnt raw by the sun
zed contd what are you doing to that kid
what do you mean nothing
you were just going to kill him
no i was going to sacrifice him
theres a difference
indicating isaac not to him im guessing
isaac nods gratefully
by what right do you interfere
art thou an angel of the lord
good question what do you think
nods sagely verily thou wast sent to stay my hand by the eternal one blessed be he
whatever you just said
oh helps isaac off the altar stone and unties him
confidentially to oh hes nuts
im telling you hes totally lost it
to zed i am abraham son of terah of the house of nahor
i am zed and this is oh sons of people you wouldnt know
the tents of my kinsmen lie just beyond
there will you find all that you desire
abraham leads isaac zed and oh past the colorful tents of his people
the camp is alive with activity
the spacious tent is lit by torches and a feast is in progress
twenty or thirty bearded men in skullcaps and long robes lounge on cushions or sit cross legged in a circle on the carpeted floor
an egyptian belly dancer shakes her hips for the pleasure of abraham who occupies the place of honor
zed and oh now also wearing robes and skullcaps are sitting right beside him eating and drinking everything in sight
isaac sits beside them
abraham claps his hands for attention
zed and oh look up as the music stops
to the assembly my brothers let us give thanks unto god for staying my hand on the mountain this day
humoring him best dad in all the land everyone
a ritual response in praise be to god hallowed be his name
and for the bounty which he hath bestowed unto us
in unison he hath increased our wealth and blessed us with his loving kindness
zed and oh mutter along trying to fit in
a beat late mumble mumble mumble loving kindness
abraham looks at them
friends whence comest thou
zed and oh look at each other blankly
he wants to know where youre from
thou comest not from the cities of the plain
from sodom or gomorrah
zed perks up at the mention of sodom recalling the destination of the soldiers who took maya and the others
sodom and gomorrah
never been there
but ive heard of them
are they nice
the lord has cursed them for their abomination
nods gravely i didnt know that
what kind of abomination are we talking about
they bow down before false gods and worship graven images
clicks his tongue abominable
the men of the city are weak and soft fat with rich food intoxicated by strong drink
sounds good to him really
tell me more
their women are whores their shameless lust knows no bounds
they flaunt their flesh without shame and any man may have knowledge of them
hes sold and where exactly are those cities
off abrahams stern look we just want to know so we can avoid them
walk not the path of sodom
for surely will the lord send his holy fire to destroy the city and all who dwell within to smite them and all their seed for their iniquity
when do you think all this smiting is going to go down
we may have some friends there
getting up accompany me
abraham sweeps out of the tent
zed and oh jump to their feet and follow
isaac tags along
abraham walks to the edge of the desert
torchlight from the camp flickers on his face as he gazes across the desolate moonlit landscape
abraham im a little worried about the city being destroyed
their fate is sealed
but for my faith and devotion the self same god has given unto me the whole of this land from the jordan to the negev from the river of egypt
to the great euphrates
this did he grant to me and my seed
he raises his arms and spreads them wide
this is all your land
yeah god just forgot to tell anyone else
were having a war with someone like every five minutes
scowls at him i and my kinsmen have vanquished our enemies by the mighty hand of the lord praised be he
zed and oh fake their way through a ritual response
his name is praise and love his whole graciousness of his wealthy bounty
abraham gets a strange faraway look in his eyes
therefore to signify my covenant with the one true god on this night will i circumcise the flesh of my foreskin and of you and every male who dwells hereby
im not clear here we go again we will grasp the foreskins of our penises and cut therefrom the extra flesh
im not sure i have any extra
couldnt we could just get our ears pierced
aside to zed okay what did i tell you nuts
you know abe its late and weve all had a lot to drink and i know this whole foreskin thing sounds like a good idea now but you may just
want to sleep on it
we could always cut em off in the morning but if we do it now theres just no putting it back on later
so it shall be written so it shall be done
to isaac get my big knife
zed and oh both reflexively cover their crotches
zed and oh stumble over the rocky hills
they hear a pained scream from someone being circumcised back at abrahams camp
you have any idea where were going
to the city
i have to find maya
he said gods going to smite them with holy fire
and youre going to listen to him
you think hes more chosen than me
he seemed to know what he was talking about
yes and he also wanted to give his dick a little trim
hey wait up
zed and oh turn to see isaac running towards them
out of breath im coming with you
you dont even know where were going
youre going to sodom right
your dad specifically said sodom and gomorrah were evil
if i show you how to get there will you buy me a bottle of wine
i told you thats not where were going
then well just stand here
they stand there for less than a beat
zed contd okay you win
take us to sodom
isaac takes a couple of steps to the top of a rise and points off in the distance
shining in the moonlight the magnificent city of sodom set atop a broad hill surrounded by high walls
i knew it was right around here
me and my friends sneak in on the weekends
we hang around pick up on the babes drink some wine get wasted on killer hash you shouldnt be smoking either
thanks grandpa but ive been smoking for four harvests so i think im okay
they start down toward the city
zed oh and isaac gape at the high masonry walls as they approach the massive solid wooden gates
gee theyre not open
we should probably come back later
you just have to knock
they always let me in
to oh go ahead
why do i have to knock
what if were waking somebody up
lets just get out of here
back to the penis cutter
besides eema and maya might be in there
you want to get them out before the citys destroyed dont you
isaac impatiently grabs a big rock and starts banging on the door
suddenly zed and oh are yanked off their feet from behind and slammed into the wall by helmeted sentries
isaac quickly runs away
shouts at him halt
isaac stops a safe distance away and turns back to taunt the guards
you gonna make me
dancing and dodging like a boxer you and what army
shouts to isaac get help
tell your father
shouts back yeah
isaac contd like im really gonna tell my father i came with you to sodom
so long suckers
he takes off running
to oh i kinda get why his dad wanted to kill him
the sentries drag them through a small door cut into a corner of the city gates
the sentries shove them into a small guard post and throw them up against the wall
three other guards look up at the new arrivals
whats this now
they were banging on the gate
hebrews from the look of them
were not really hebrews the guard smacks him in the mouth
zed contd okay
should we wake the sergeant
you dont want to do that
he gets pretty mean when you wake him
meaner than this
the sentry grabs ohs nipple and twists
oh screams loudly
the guards freeze at the sound of his scream and look nervously to a closed door at one end of the room
from behind the door zed and oh exchange worried looks
then the door flies open and the sergeant a huge angry sadistic rhino of a man fills the door frame
sergeant contd who the hell screamed
they all point at oh
sergeant contd glowers at him i thought it was a woman
he lumbers over and gets his face very close to ohs
sergeant contd you dont look like a woman but maybe you want to kiss me anyway
is that right
you want to kiss me
oh turns away from his foul breath
the sergeant grabs oh by the throat and practically lifts him off the ground
sergeant contd by morning youll be sorry you were born
dont have to wait til morning
why dont you pick on someone your own size
the sergeant drops oh and turns to zed
zed contd quickly backpedaling which would be difficult since there are probably very few people around who actually are your size he smacks zed hard on the side of the
to another guard get my big stick
ill deal with the fat one first
relatively fat one
i wouldnt be talking about fat if i were you
another blow from the sergeant
zed contd right
the sergeant rips open zeds shirt exposing his back then steps up behind oh and does the same
a guard hands him a lethal looking bat studded with sharp spikes
to zed and oh welcome to sodom
as he takes a big backswing zed and oh shut their eyes and prepare for the worst
zed and oh turn to see cain at the door dressed like the other guards in breastplate and helmet
i know these guys
he embraces them
they look confused and doubtful but relieved
cain leads them through the narrow crowded streets
people avoid cains gaze and part like the red sea to allow him through
you know you guys are lucky that sergeant is a friend of mine
i let him sodomize me once right after i got here and hes been real nice to me ever since
yeah thanks for saving us
what are you going to do to us now
cain stops and looks at them
wait a second
do i detect a tone here
all right honestly
you did sell us into slavery
instantly offended whoa whoa whoa
hold a grudge much
that was like a fortnight ago
that was way less than a fortnight
half a fortnight maybe
give me a break
i was dealing with the death of a close family member and i needed some space
but now i realize that you guys are like my brothers
and its so rare to find a brother that you love
he embraces them
now you guys hungry
cain walks up to a food vendors stall and stares menacingly at the vendor
he raises his fist
the vendor cowers
cain contd contd to vendor thats two for flinching
cain grabs two lamb kebabs and hands them to zed and oh
cain contd thats the kind of love im talkin about
as they eat hungrily zed makes eye contact with a prostitute lounging in a doorway
check out that woman across the street
shes looking at us
the prostitute smiles at them as she sensuously peels a banana then slides the whole thing unbroken into her mouth
we are so in
shes eye knowing us like crazy
youre gonna love sodom
this morning i almost got a handie behind that pita stand
well i kind of have a girlfriend not a girlfriend yet but a girl i like so i shouldnt hey what happens in sodom stays in sodom
he takes a jug of wine from the stall of a wine merchant
the merchant just bows obsequiously and keeps his mouth shut
cain contd you know if you guys are staying you should join the guards
the pays not great but theres tons of perks
im telling you its the only way to go
cain grabs a piece of candy from a small child and stuffs it in his mouth
the child starts crying cain kicks her in the ass and she runs away
to the child sorry
come on ill introduce you to the captain
a military drum roll and the blare of trumpets rouse the garrison
guardsmen come double timing out of the barracks and hurry to line up in formation
last to emerge are zed and oh who step leisurely out the door now dressed as royal guards
zed actually looks dashing but ohs breastplate is too big and his helmet keeps slipping down over his eyes
this is great
how do i look
you look good but i think my hats too big
they notice an officer staring at them
oh contd to the officer do you happen to know where i could get a smaller hat
the officer pops him on the head with a truncheon
zed and oh hustle into line orders are shouted and the troop marches off
zed and oh are on patrol with cain in the heart of the city
so is this it
we just walk around
we just look for troublemakers and kick the living shit out of em
what kind of trouble
if we see a thief or a pickpocket we just slap him around maybe cut off a finger or an ear or the tip of his nose lower lip anything
you can just grab and slice in one fluid motion then we take our share of the loot and let him go
mostly what we worry about are activist types rabble rousers getting people all riled up against the king or the temple priests
thats death for sure
pretty harsh isnt it
harsh times brother
were in the middle of a famine
people are starving
if we dont get some rain soon it could get ugly
looking forward to it then well get to start kicking ass big time
he stops to flog a beggar with his hand out
cain contd beat it you filthy beggar
you cant blame people for being hungry
yeah well just remember its the palace that pays you not the people
suddenly they hear a regal fanfare of approaching trumpets and turn to look
at the sound of the trumpets everyone in the crowded square falls to the ground and prostrates himself
cain pulls oh to the ground but zed is left standing there oblivious as the royal entourage approaches
oh taps on zeds leg trying to get his attention but zed just ignores it too transfixed to notice that hes the only one standing
eight strong male slaves enter the square carrying an ornately decorated litter shaded with a silk canopy
on it is the princess inanna a stunning young woman richly dressed and bejeweled with exotic eyes and luscious red lips
a handmaiden rides along fanning her with a big ostrich plume fan
zed sees the princess and is instantly taken with her beauty
princess inanna glances his way and cant help but notice hes the only person in the square still standing
she gives him a quizzical smile then turns away imperiously
as the litter passes her handmaiden continues to stare at zed
he doesnt recognize her but we do
its maya now elaborately costumed and made up
zed gawks at the princess then suddenly a royal guard knocks him to the ground and stands on his neck as the rest of the entourage passes
on the ground excitedly to oh did you see that girl
i think she liked me
she looked right at me
gee i wonder why
the royal guard takes his foot off zeds neck and they all get back to their feet
who was she
the princess inanna
shes totally hot but dont even think about it
because shes royalty and youre scum
the entire crowd starts moving in the same direction as the royal entourage
wheres everybody going
to the temple
starts walking you have to see this
will she be there
everybody will be there
at the center of the square is a magnificent temple adorned with elaborate carvings and monumental statues of pagan gods
before it is a great altar in front of a huge stone idol
the idols mouth is a gaping fiery furnace
behind the temple is a towering ziggurat still under construction
a hundred trumpeters and drummers blast a solemn fanfare as ornately garbed priests ceremoniously climb the stairs to the altar
stare at the spectacle
the princess inanna takes her seat near the king the queen the ministers and other nobles
maya stands behind the princess and continues fanning her
zed spots the princess on the pavilion
hey there she is
he starts edging toward the royal pavilion
under a broad awning the king and queen snack from a table covered with platters of exotic fruits and sweetmeats
the king an imposing man with shakespearean gravity wipes his mouth and glances at the princess inanna
the princess isnt eating
i find it hard to eat when so many are hungry
as if your concern is enviable
and besides im so fat
the queen s still beautiful reacts
for the hundredth time youre not fat yes i am mother
those new linen pants you got me from egypt make my ass look just huge
well you cant keep starving yourself
everybody else is starving present company excluded
you may be my step daughter but these are dangerous times and those are dangerous words
i weep for the suffering of my people but the spirit of rebellion is alive in the city and if necessary i will crush it with every means at my
for the good of the people
warning her for the good of everyone who enjoys the favor of the throne
im just so incredibly bored
the fanfare climaxes as the great temple doors slowly open and the high priest emerges followed by a retinue of priestesses and a dozen vestal virgins
they walk in solemn silence to ritual positions around the altar
the high priest is even more elaborately costumed than the nobles ridiculously so standing very tall on high platform shoes with heavy eye makeup his hair and beard even oilier
than the others
he turns to the altar raises his hands to the heavens and begins his invocation
intoning pompously o el lord of heaven and earth baal the sublime shapash goddess of the sun hadad the storm god over ruling son of dagon the bountiful god of
grain our earthly sustenance he makes his way to a position just below the royal pavilion and stares up at the princess inanna
she sees him looking at her but pretends not to notice
isnt that the idiot who was standing up in the street
maya sees him too and starts fuming
the high priest continues
we come before you in humble supplication invoking your blessing the sweet rain which waters our fields enriches the harvest fills our storehouses makes mighty the house of ish ka
bi baal and the city of sodom the king nods graciously
high priest contd and feeds us your children with the bounty of your grace
she glances at zed again but this time a slight smile crosses her lips
zed grins back at her
the princess whispers something to her handmaiden maya and subtly points zed out to her
maya nods obediently glaring at zed and starts fanning the princess a little too vigorously
accept now this humble sacrifice to the power and glory of your magnificence
he starts inspecting the vestal virgins beautiful young women in diaphanous almost transparent white gowns
have no idea whats going on
zed turns to the guy next to official white
hes picking a virgin
the high priest is moving down the line of beautiful young maidens
he comes to one slutty girl who seems so obviously not a virgin he does a double take and kicks her out of the line
what do they want a virgin for
to throw into the fire
like talking to an idiot offering to the gods
theres a famine going on
if we dont make a good sacrifice it wont rain
no rain no harvest
no harvest no food
its pretty self explanatory
you throw the virgin in the fire so itll rain
seems like a waste of a perfectly good virgin to me
these virgins its always a girl right
a great cheer goes up as a girl is chosen
she swoons as the priestesses slip off her vestment and two priests escort her to the fiery mouth of the furnace
for the love of the gods and the glory of their creation the great dome of heaven the green growing earth we commit this maiden to your holy fire
another great cheer from the crowd as they throw her into the fire
this is just crazy
maya approaches them but zed and oh still dont recognize her
eyes downcast the princess wishes to see you
staring at her cleavage her wish is my command
points at zed me
then motioning to oh were kind of a package deal
can he come with
the three of us are inseparable
were like brothers
cain squeezes both their shoulders and gives maya an artificial smile
maya ignores cain and points to zed and oh
the two of you follow me
to cain ill try to put in a good word for you
cain fumes as zed and oh head off with maya
a squad of sentries stands guard at the massive iron palace gates
a crowd of beggars is pressed against the gate pleading for food
zed and oh approach led by maya
the guards brutally push the beggars aside and they enter
maya leads zed and oh through the gate and into a beautiful atrium where they are met by a fat bald eunuch wearing the royal livery
to oh this is zaftig the eunuch
you go with him
oh is led away by the eunuch as she takes zed off in the opposite direction
cant i go with him
is he your lover
laughs at the thought hah
that would be weird
the eunuch just shrugs apparently not that weird to him
oh contd so what do you do
i serve the royal family little of this little of that
ive been a palace eunuch since i was nine years old
youve been living here since you were nine
looks around impressed i should look into that
how do you get to be a eunuch
they cut off your testicles
whats up with all the genital mutilation
trust me after a while you dont even miss them
no id miss them im sure
i hardly got to use them yet
the eunuch leads him down the corridor
land with a wet splat on a polished marble table
the high priest an extremely vain officious and fussy man still over dressed in sacramental drag pushes back his sleeves and starts examining the entrails as the king and his
ministers look on deeply concerned
six sacrifices in the last ten days and still no rain
what do the entrails predict
nervously poking at the sheep heart well the liver is streaked with gray thats not a favorable sign but the heart looks good
see how nice and red it is here
thats always a good omen
what does it mean
usually it means that the sheep took very good care of itself probably sticking to a high fiber diet of grass and hay
what does it mean for us
well it could mean either a surprise visit from a former friend or sweetheart or that youre going on a long sea voyage
wouldnt that be fun
how did you become high priest
because im your brother
perhaps its time for a new high priest
his eyes go wide perhaps its not time for a new high priest
he dramatically flings his fingers out at the prime minister as if wielding the power of the gods
high priest contd and let that be a warning to you
next time i will hurl a lightning bolt at your face
high priest contd or a fire ball
ignores him majesty theres talk of revolution in the streets
grain and oil are scarce prices are high starving peasants are pouring into the city looking for food poverty has a bitter taste but its the flavor they were born
its the will of the gods
the queen and princess inanna are lounging on cushioned divans listening
can the gods really be so cruel
i dont think thats cruel
its just practical
if everybody was rich whod wait on us
maya approaches and whispers something to the princess
see that hes bathed and dressed then bring him to me
maya frowns and exits
inanna contd to the queen this should be amusing
maya leads zed down a grand hallway
zed is now wearing a long flowing robe of silk brocade fine sandals and jewelry
his hair has been combed and pulled back into a loose ponytail
he stops to admire himself in a mirror
what do you think ponytail or no ponytail
you know what
zed contd ill start with the ponytail see where the night takes me
maya rolls her eyes and leads zed to the entrance of the great hall
cain and another guard are posted at the door
zed contd hey you made it
whats it like inside
i wouldnt know
im just a guard because my brother didnt pull any strings with his friends in the royal court
look first of all were not actually brothers just like abel
i oughta just bash your head in hey
you didnt let me finish
as soon as i get in there im going to talk to somebody and get you invited okay
have a nice orgy
cain pulls open the big doors and zed steps through the portal
cain tries to steal peeks inside as the heavy doors slam shut
a full scale orgy is going on in a magnificent hall
as maya leads him into the room zed pulls his hair out of the ponytail
feels like a hair down kinda scene dont you think
as you wish
be sure to try the fruit
zed looks at her and finally recognizes her
what are you doing here
i had no choice
im a slave remember
i was going to rescue you
in fact we came here to find you
not buying it wait here until youre sent for
this wasnt my idea you know
of course not
you were just chosen again
maybe after you and the princess get together you can start thinking about someone beside yourself
she walks off before he can answer
zed shakes his head looks around the room then starts walking past a row of living statues semi nude men and women on pedestals covered head to toe in gold
body paint frozen in heroic postures that show off their beautiful bodies
zed looks closely at one beautiful nude goddess then furtively reaches out and fondles her breast
the goddess slaps his hand then resumes her pose
watch it jerk
youre a real girl
that is so cool
he moves down the row of living sculptures mugging at them mock humping and waving his hands in their faces trying to make them move but they remain frozen
zed contd amazing
he comes to the last statue and does a double take
this one is wearing only a skimpy cloth diaper and is posed like someone waiting for a bus
he is also painted gold but unlike the others he has a little potbelly and round shoulders and cant seem to hold still for very long shifting his weight uncomfortably
and looking around in obvious embarrassment
zed contd recognizing him oh
oh looks down from his pedestal
through clenched teeth im not supposed to talk
im a statue
yeah you look so gold
hows it going
hows it going
i just had my whole body painted by a fat guy with no balls and believe me he was very thorough if you know what i mean
hows it going with you
had a little rub and a scrub now im up for some grub
that sounds nice for you
youll never guess whos here maya
shes working here and she looks great
but shes kinda mad at me
oh scans the great hall looking for her and spots zeds sister eema his crush come into the room carrying a tray of food
eema has been beautifully groomed and is now dressed as a household slave
she stops to serve some rowdy officers who take the opportunity to tease and fondle her
she tries to pull away but sargon the general grabs her arm
stand still wench
i want to see whats under that skirt
as he starts to lift her hem she drops the whole tray of food on him
his cohorts laugh
it was an accident
that was no accident
sargon grabs her and raises his hand to hit her
zed steps in quickly
he pulls her away from i told you to fetch me more wine
apologize to this officer now
now go fetch
wait by that skinny statue
ill deal with you later
as eema exits zed turns to the officers and shrugs
zed contd slaves what are you gonna do
try using a hot poker
that they understand
i will keep that in mind
zed bows then leaves him and joins eema who is waiting at ohs pedestal
zed contd what are you doing here
we were sold to the palace
but i wont serve these people
id rather die
keep that up and you will
what are you doing here
notices his clothes have you joined them
i havent joined anything
re the gold body paint does this look like fun
they both look accusingly at zed
okay i know what youre thinking but im just checking it out
we kept hearing that this place was so evil but now that i look around im thinking maybe its not all bad
theres a lot to learn here
like human sacrifice
like the wheel for instance
thats pretty awesome the way it just goes around in a circle
and metal writing money pottery hot baths
back in the village we thought sharpening a stick was a big breakthrough
to oh what happened to him
look i think ive been chosen to do something great with my life here we go again and i dont think its hunting wild pigs and weaving baskets
maya returns for zed
she wants to see you now
i hope you dont think im interested in her
why would i think that
just because you couldnt take your eyes off her im just using her maya
its part of my plan
im going to get you all out of here as soon as i can
whats your plan
not a clue its a secret
not buying it forget it
maya sees a guard watching them and reverts to her slave attitude
maya contd bowing to zed the princess awaits you
and i await her
to oh and eema you two await me
then confidentially to eema and oh stay out of trouble
ill be back
he exits with maya
he has no idea what hes doing does he
i dont know
so much has happened
sometimes i think she walks away
oh contd wistfully to himself i love you
lounging on a divan surrounded by young men
oh walks by still painted gold
to oh you there
rub me with oil
the high priest dismisses the young men then stands and lets his rich outer robe fall to the floor
his chest back and shoulders are incredibly hairy
id rather not if you dont mind
im not really a slave
im a guard
then maybe youd rather i speak to your commander and have you whipped to within an inch of your life
or perhaps i whip you myself
how would you like that
are those my choices
id say so
the high priest lies back down
oh looks around finds a pitcher filled with precious oil and dribbles some on the high priests hairy chest
splashes a few more drops on him that enough
getting angry no
much more you insolent dolt
oh pours oil liberally over his chest back and shoulders
high priest contd thats good
now rub it in
with my hands
oh grimaces and starts gingerly massaging the oil into his hairy chest and shoulders
high priest contd in ecstasy mmmmm i love it
the sweet scent of precious oil
the oily oiliness
eema walks by with a pitcher of wine and sees oh massaging the high priest
this isnt what you think
no its fine
this really explains a lot about you that i didnt get before
im just rubbing oil on this man
i have an idea
why dont we go back to my place and see whats under all that paint
maya ushers zed into the dimly lit room
she leaves him
a haze of heavily scented incense hangs in the air
come to me
zed turns and sees the princess standing on the terrace
zed steps out onto the moonlit terrace
he crosses to the balustrade and stands beside the princess gazing out over the twinkling cityscape
beautiful isnt it
you can see gomorrah just over the hill
i didnt know it was so close
theyre called the twin cities
looks pretty from up here but some people think god is going to wipe them out because theyre so evil
toying with him and what do you think
am i evil
i dont really know you
but you dont look evil
do you find me attractive
i think youre incredible
moving closer i have body issues
no youre perfect
your face your hair looking into her eyes your eyes are like the sea
a beat my eyes are brown
well its kinda dark
i took a shot
i know theyre big though and wet she pulls him close
zed contd can i ask you one thing
what would a girl like you want with a guy like me
i dont know
i just find you interesting
they say its the will of the gods that some men should suffer while others rule that were all just victims of our fate
and i believed that until this morning when i saw you standing up alone in the square
and i said to myself finally heres one man who refuses to bow down to anything considers explaining but just lets it go yeah
yes finally a man who has the courage to question the order of things a man chosen by the gods to do something great
thats exactly what ive been thinking
you wouldnt believe the things that have been happening to me lately
i just didnt know why
gets very very close i know why
to bring you here to this place to me
i couldnt agree more
im trying to agree more but i cant
thats how much i agree
she takes his hand and leads him away
a shadowy figure watches them from behind a curtain
we can see torchlight flickering inside the temple and two figures moving among the pillars
the high priest is giving oh a personal tour of the inner sanctum
oh is scrubbed and dressed like a junior priest
my life is devoted to the service of the gods and the good of the people
i take nothing for myself
he has a huge gold ring set with precious gems on every finger and a gold tiara on his head studded with rubies and emeralds
thats so unselfish of you
yes it is
its just so lonely
sometimes i hunger for the touch of another human being
heres a riddle what has two thumbs and wants another oil rub
pointing thumbs at this guy
ohquickly changes the subject
so where does that hall lead to
his eyes light up come ill show you
he takes ohs arm and leads him down the hail toward a set of incredibly impressive doors covered with cuneiform writing and arcane religious symbols
high priest contd behind those doors is the holy of holies the earthly domain of the
official white high priest contd gods a place so ineffably sacred so powerful that to enter is instant death for any mortal
a long beat so who cleans it
it needs no cleaning
no of course not
cant let go of it kind of makes you wonder though the guys who built it did they just die the minute they finished or did the gods give them
a second to get out
starting to get annoyed i assume they finished it then the gods descended
yeah thats probably it
another long beat so youre saying we cant go in
i just told you
to enter is instant death
only i can go in and only once a year after very elaborate purification rituals and days of special prayers and offerings
right right right
what if we just open the doors and stick our heads in
im sorry i brought it up
pushes oh along move
he shoos him down the hall
zed and princess inanna stealthily enter the temple
looking around nervously what are we doing here
i want you to enter the holy of holies
now youre talking
should i enter it right here or should we go back to your bedroom
does the holy of holies like to be entered from behind or
thats the holy of holies you have to go in there and talk to the gods
the gods are in there
so they say but the only one who ever goes in is the high priest
they say its instant death for anyone else to enter
then why am i going in
because you were chosen
if the gods wanted you dead they would have killed you already
this is what youve been chosen for
to speak to the gods and plead with them not to destroy the city
then come back out and tell me what its like inside
mulling it over right right
then again if the rules say do you always follow the rules
what is it with chicks always wanting guys to break the rules
you all have this bad boy complex she kisses him fiercely on the lips
do this for me
im going in
he enters the holy of holies
a figure darts between the columns and hides in the shadows
a beam of moonlight reveals the mark of cain on his forehead
zed steps into the chamber and immediately prostrates himself face down on the floor arms outstretched in supplication
he lies there with his eyes tightly shut expecting to be vaporized any second
a long moment passes in total silence
then he opens his eyes and looks around tentatively
the inner chamber of the holy of holies is a bare room with marble walls lit only by shafts of moonlight from skylights above
takes a deep breath and starts improvising thank you o merciful ones for not like killing me and letting me receive the uh blessing of your holy godliness
he exhales and closes his eyes again waiting for some divine response
zed contd props himself up on his okay i dont know the right words so im just going to say what i have to say if thats all right
waits for a response gets none proceeds i know i havent always done the right thing
eating the fruit was bad i know that and the cain thing and i have done somethings with women i do love the ladies well you probably know all that
because youre watching everything a thought occurs do you really watch everything
thats got to be a little disgusting sometimes but probably pretty hot too not that you would get off on any of it okay im getting off the subject
anyways the word is youve been considering destroying this place
so im asking you not to as a personal favor
feel free to jump in anytime
i could use a little guidance here
still no response
he rolls over onto his back
zed contd look i know you think this place is evil and it kinda is i see that but thats not everybody
there are a lot of good people too
so what if there were like fifty really good people
would you still destroy the city
okay youre right that may be a reach
how about twenty
i could probably get you twenty extremely good people if i really looked around
how about five
five awesome people including myself
i personally know at least five people worth saving
does that sound good
zed contd hello
a little help
am i getting warm here
okay is it me
are you punishing me for stuff i did
an insight or setting me up for what i need to do
could you give me some kind of a sign please anything
zed listens but hears only a profound silence
then a revelation
he sits up on the floor
zed contd okay wait
is that the sign
is that it
waits for confirmation it is isnt it
just this really silent silence
youre not going to tell me what to do its up to me to decide whats right and whats wrong right
is that it
youre not going to speak to me youre going to speak through me
if thats right dont say anything
listens for a beat okay i read you loud and clear
an afterthought oh and if things dont work out with maya would it be okay with you if me and the princess had a little carnal knowledge
not in an evil way or anything he listens silence okay
youre right probably not a good idea
he backs out of the holy of holies bowing all the way
the doors to the holy of holies opens and zed comes backing out still bowing and muttering
then he turns and his face falls
the high priest the king the queen and a dozen temple acolytes are staring at him in amazement
oh stands beside the high priest dressed just like him
i was just looking for the bathroom
i told him not to go in
scared points at zed seize him
the guards arrest oh as cain steps up and takes hold of zed
shouldve invited me to the party
in the dim torchlight we see zed hanging spread eagle five feet off the ground his arms and legs stretched out wide and tightly bound to iron rings imbedded in
oh is shackled to the wall beside him hanging upside down
they hear the faint scream of a man being tortured somewhere deep in the prison
i wish i was upside down
oh wont talk to him
zed contd so this is it
were not friends anymore
after all ive done for you
what have you done for me
ive been attacked by a cougar ive fallen down a mountain i almost had the tip of my thingy cut off ive been greasing up the high priest all night
and now im hanging upside down in a dungeon
and i have to pee real bad
all because of you
you call yourself a friend
name one good thing youve done for me
ive helped you come out of your shell
in distress i really have to pee listen i know im not perfect and i may have made a few wrong turns but you have to understand im a chosen
thats a lot of responsibility you cant even imagine
the only one who thinks youre chosen is you so shut up already
okay be mad but im going to get us out of here if its the last thing i do
zed starts frantically yanking on his shackles to no avail
zed contd that was just my first idea and im also accepting ideas
i have to pee
cant hold it anymore oh no official white
because hes upside down the streams runs down his stomach over his chest down his neck onto his chin and over his face
oh contd i hate you
a curious jeering mob is gathering as zed and oh in shackles are led by a squad of guards to a raised platform in the middle of the square
the heavy pounding of martial drums silences the crowd
cain presides over the execution
he addresses the crowd
for the crimes of blasphemy the crowd grumbles its grumble grumble serious grumbling admiring oohs and aahs and the murder of my brother abel oh come on
for these and other crimes they may not actually have done yet but were pretty sure they were thinking about the prisoners will be stoned to death
the crowd roars as guards stationed around the square pull canvas covers off big baskets of rocks and the people rush to grab stones to throw
zed and oh instinctively move closer to each other
the king queen high priest and royal ministers observe the stoning from their vantage point above the square
princess inanna refuses to look
observe my dear
it seems the least you could do since it was you who lured him to his death
she reluctantly turns and looks at zed
i didnt intend for this to happen
the people move in and surround the platform on all sides baseball size rocks in their hands
to zed and oh anything to say before the sentence is carried out
to the crowd i just want to say this is really messed up the people fling their rocks with all their might
zed and oh duck
the rocks fly over their heads and hit people in the crowd on the opposite sides several bystanders taking painful hits in the head some falling down unconscious
cain notes the impracticality of having people throw rocks from all directions
cain contd okay
this isnt working
can i make a suggestion
why dont you just pick one person to throw
the crowd thinks thats not a bad idea and murmurs agreement
zed contd pressing the advantage in fact dont you think it would be fair for us to get to pick the person who stones us
cain looks doubtful but the crowd thinks this is eminently fair
some eagerly raising their hands and waving like school children yes
the king grabs sargon
re cain what is that idiot doing
zed spots a good candidate in the crowd
we pick him
cain points at a big guy heavily muscled eagerly waving his hand
no next to him
he points at a boy about nine years old and not very big
hes just a kid
you got something against kids
zed plays the crowd which starts booing in disapproval
zed contd this guy hates kids
whats he got against kids
children are the future
give the kid a shot
on the balcony the king shifts uncomfortably intimidated by the power of the mob
he nods to sargon who signals to cain
well try it
grab a rock
the boy picks up a good size rock
zed turns to oh
good thinking huh
they turn to face the boy ready to dodge when he throws
the boy winds up and fires a major league fastball that smacks oh right on the forehead
the crowd cheers
zed contd holy shit
that kids got an arm
i think he hit me
the boy fires again
oh spins and tries to duck but takes the rock right on the head
oh contd hey
theres two of us
the crowd cheers and pats the kid on the back
okay everybody on this side now
on the count of three
one two official white
i have a question for the king
the crowd goes silent
all eyes turn and look up to the palace balcony
zed contd shouts to the king why didnt i die in the holy of holies
on the balcony everyone is totally stopped by his question
one by one they all look to the high priest who seems to be stumped
in the square the crowd starts muttering
zed seizes the initiative
zed contd i entered the holy of holies and lo i did not die
because i am chosen by the gods
he is chosen
he is the chosen one
the chosen one
zed gives oh a look see
i told you
starts chanting spare the chosen one
spare the chosen one
spare the chosen one
and his friend
dont forget his friend
on the balcony the king and his ministers hastily confer with the high priest
could it be
is he truly chosen
i dont i suppose its possible id have to examine some new imbecile
majesty with respect whether hes chosen or not is no longer the issue
to kill him now given the public mood could inflame the situation enough to prompt a radical regime change if you take my meaning
the king looks grimly at his ministers all of whom have lean and hungry looks
princess inanna smiles contemptuously at him
addressing the crowd in the square
by order of the king the sentence has been commuted
the crowd cheers
zed and oh exchange hopeful looks
cant we just stone them a little
it is the judgement of our most merciful king that the prisoners are to be enslaved to toil at hard labor until they die of exhaustion or starvation
exuberant fist pump yes
oh is up to his knees in a mud pit trampling straw into the thick mud
a guard cracks a bullwhip which flicks painfully across his shoulders
okay you think that actually makes anybody work harder
it just makes them resent you
is that what you want
whips him again faster
can i just ask when lunch is
the whip lashes out again
oh glowers at him and steps up the pace
marlak and enmebaragesi are stacking bricks when zed approaches
greets them hey
long time no see
they glance up but ignore him
zed contd dont tell me youre still mad about maya
thats so over
i have a thing going with the princess now well almost had a thing
im a slave now just like you
youre not just like me
we do have our differences like about a cup and half of brain tissue but that doesnt mean we cant work together
another guard approaches and whacks marlak with his stick
take those bricks to the top
the masons are waiting
marlak and enmebaragesi glower at the guard as they pick up ropes and harness themselves to a cart loaded with bricks
guard contd to zed you
he grabs another rope harness off the cart and throws it to zed
you know id like to but i did something to my neck massages his neck i mustve slept on it funny those dungeon pillows are like rocks well they are
rocks so i should probably take it easy or ill be no damn good for work tomorrow
strikes him across the back with his stick i said move
but i should tell you this isnt really my area
im just on a break from the mud department the guard draws his short sword and raises it over zed
one more word and you die putting on the harness okay okay
to marlak and okay boys on the count of three
one two three
marlak and enmebaragesi lunge against the ropes but zed makes no effort to pull
they glare at him
zed contd learned that from maya
good trick huh
okay together this time
they pull together and the heavy cart starts to move
zed marlak and enmebaragesi haul the heavy cart of bricks to the very top of the tower
two bricklayers are working on the wall
zed leans against the wall next to them tb rest
how high you guys think were going with this
up to heaven i guess
thats how tall they usually build em
looking up thats ambitious
we worked on the tower of babel
now that was a ziggurat
zed looks down at his crotch
you should see it when im excited
oh right the tower
snickers to himself see the egyptians are working on an entirely different concept
four sides slanting walls pointy top
like a pyramid
yet timeless in a way
a slave child approaches with a water bucket
to zed want some water
as the child offers him the ladle zed recognizes her
youre from the village arent you
the child nods
zed contd i bet you wish you were back there right now dont you
the child nods again
zed contd well dont give up
youre going to get home someday
marlak kicks zed from behind knocking him over
standing over him whos going to take her there
the chosen one
marlak kicks gravel and dirt in zeds face
zed just lies there and takes it feeling like hes failed everyone
then he hears the beating of drums and trumpet fanfares coming from the temple square below
oh and the other slaves are mustered by the guards
get in line
wherere we going
to watch the sacrifice
the king demands it
is that compulsory
because i saw one when i first got here and it made me a little sick the guards whip catches him across the back
oh contd ow
why dont you try using your words for a change
the square is filling up with people
the royal procession is moving to the seats of honor to watch the sacrifice
cain is now among the royal guard having been promoted for his treachery
he bows and helps the queen to her seat
leering seductively at your service my lady
theres a depraved thought
youre so delightfully low
thank you your majesty
he touches his tongue to the tip of his nose and waggles his eyebrows
the king arrives with sargon to loud booing from the crowd
are they booing me
how dare they
your highness with all due respect those were woos
they love you
they were wooing you
the king looks doubtfully at the hostile crowd
all is in readiness majesty
glares at the king what now
more virgins to sacrifice
yes two followers of the chosen one discovered by this loyal soldier
cain bows to the king
just doing my duty
and one more to demonstrate our own faith and charity
the king stands and makes a proclamation loud enough for everyone to hear
king contd in supplication to the gods for the love of the people we offer a humble sacrifice to the sacred temple fire our own step daughter the princess inanna
the crowd gasps
king contd to inanna for the good of the people
stands in protest you wouldnt dare
if you like i could arrange for you to join her
the queen slowly sits back down
king contd to inanna how long did you think id tolerate your insolence
to sargon burn her
sargon and cain seize inanna but she shrugs them off and rises with dignity
ill see you all in hell
the flames are starting to build inside the idols mouth
oh and the slaves are confined behind a barrier watched by a squad of guards waiting for the ceremony to start
the temple doors open slowly and the high priest appears holding a long jewelled staff
oh turns to the edomite slave next to him
casually name dropping see the high priest
i know him
dear friend of mine
now the procession of sacrificial virgins is led out by the high priestess
maya and eema are among them their hands tied
they look like theyve been drugged
oh spots eema and maya among the virgins
i know them
i guess you know everybody dont you
oh shoulders his way right up to the barrier where a big guard stops him with a spear to his neck
thats far enough slave
oh stops right there frustrated and frightened
inanna is led out last now also having been drugged
zed marlak and the sharp eyed enmebaragesi look down trying to see whats going on
theyre bringing out the women
how are you seeing that far
i see your sister eema its maya
the drums and trumpets kick up the tempo and the high priest starts leading the virgins to the idols fiery mouth
oh pushes against the barrier restrained by the guard
we have to do something
somebody has to stop it
turning to the other we cant let them do this
the slaves start to mutter
the guards draw their swords and heft their spears now on high alert
zed looks around desperately trying to figure out what to do
to marlak i have to get down there
over my dead body
without a moments hesitation marlak grabs him and tosses him off the top of the ziggurat
he screams all the way down
who saw that coming
zed looks around quickly grabs the end of a long coiled rope attached to a big pulley and hands marlak the other end
looping the rope around his waist lower me down
without waiting for a response zed bravely jumps off the top of the ziggurat holding the rope
marlak looks at the rope in his hands pulls it a little and sees that its not attached to the rope zed was holding
hes descending rapidly rappelling off the side of the ziggurat
he looks up expecting marlak to belay him and slow him down
any time now marlak
marlak and enmebaragesi watch his descent dumbly interested in what happens next
zed sees hes not slowing down and tries to swing himself onto one of the upper levels of the ziggurat
however when he swings in he hits a cart loaded with bricks and bounces off painfully
the sudden jolt dislodges the wheel chock that was holding the cart on the sloping ramp of the tower
the cart starts to roll down the ramp gathering speed as it careens toward the edge
he raises his staff and invokes the gods
we implore the great gods of heaven to show us a sign that we may honor your divine will and be worthy of your blessing
the brick cart explodes through the scaffolding on the side of the ziggurat and sails into the air
everybody turns at the sound of the crash and looks up at the ziggurat
the nasty guard who whipped oh earlier glances up and is instantly crushed by a ton of falling bricks
zed is still descending as the broken scaffolding starts to give way
the whole crowd watches in amazement as the foot scaffolding slowly collapses and crashes to the ground bringing tons of debris with it sending up a great cloud of dust
he looks shocked
he seizes the opportunity
its a sign
the chosen one comes
the other slaves and people in the crowd pick up his excitement
the chosen one
a sign from the gods
he doesnt quite know how to respond to the growing fervor of the crowd
well and truly the gods are with us the crowd drowns him out
a guard is standing there staring at the rubble of the scaffolding as zed comes screaming down the side of the ziggurat and lands right on top of him
zed quickly strips the unconscious guard of his weapons starts to run off stops comes back and grabs the guards helmet then takes off running to the temple square
the high priest is getting frantic now
he grabs maya and starts dragging her toward the gaping mouth of the idol and the raging fire within
she struggles but is too drugged to put up much resistance
he grabs the sacramental pitcher of oil and starts sloppily anointing her
high priest contd may the balm of this healing oil soothe your journey through the sacred fire
dont fight it
its the will of the gods
then a voice from above
i dont think so
zed is standing atop the idols head brandishing a sword and shield
she sees him and starts to revive
looks up unable to hear zed over the crowd noise
cupping his ear what did you say
i said i dont think so
shakes his head still not getting it
zed rolls his eyes in frustration and starts tentatively climbing down from the top of the idol
he jumps the last few feet and lands right in front of the fire blocking the high priests way
i said i dont think so
you dont think what
whatever that last thing you said was
guards rush toward zed from all sides but he fights like a demon slashing spinning stabbing fending off their blows with his shield
oh is inspired by zeds courage
to the edomite slave i know him too
oh springs into action attacking the big guard in front of him
the other slaves see that and start fighting with their guards a genuine slave revolt
guards start moving to help their comrades but the spirit of insurrection takes hold of the crowd and people start grappling with the guards
a platoon of reinforcements comes double timing into the square
suddenly a stooped old man throws off his cloak and pulls a sword
death to the idolators
abrahams small army of hebrews reveal themselves draw their weapons and attack the reinforcements
the last hebrew to unrobe is isaac who just stands there observing the growing chaos
shaking his head just fucking nuts
they come running into the battle swinging clubs randomly bashing heads of soldiers and innocent civilians alike
cain sees marlak and stands his ground
tough guy huh
you want a piece of me
get ready to have your head bashed in
as cain raises his truncheon marlak head butts him
cain contd nose bleeding stunned nice move
he passes out and goes down
he starts to panic at the full scale revolt and rises nervously
his ministers surround him he thinks to protect him
i knew i could depend on your loyalty
the ministers all draw daggers from their robes and move in for the kill
king contd assholes
he falls to their flashing knives
oh fights his way to the temple stairs runs up and confronts a priest who is trying to drag eema away
he fights with very little skill but tremendous energy finally overwhelming the guard and grabbing eema
suddenly shy again hello eema
still a little dazed oh
he stares at her full red lips and big blue eyes
suddenly forceful eema youre my woman
you hear me
he pulls her into an embrace and kisses her hard on the mouth
then out of the corner of his eye oh sees a guard rushing at him
oh whirls and falls off the platform accidentally cutting the guards legs out from under him
while zed is busy with the guards the high priest pulls maya toward the fire
zed sees him finishes the last of the guards and starts slowly moving toward the high priest who starts backing away until he sees oh moving toward him from the
he holds the helpless maya close to the flames
screaming and crying keep away
let her go
his mascara running no
the gods demand a sacrifice
and you ruined it
he wrestles maya even closer to the fire
trying to keep him calm why dont we just sacrifice something small a rabbit maybe
or a duck
thatd be good dont you think
a duck would not be good
then how about this
the high priest turns to oh
oh is holding the big sacramental pitcher
oh contd more oil
he splashes the high priest with a gallon of oil soaking him from head to toe
as the oil hits the high priest zed dashes across and snatches maya from his grasp
the high priest spins around in a rage his long robes wrap around his legs hobbling him he totters on his high platform shoes loses his balance and gets too
close to the idols fiery mouth
totally drenched in oil he bursts into flame like a human torch screams and staggers right into the mouth of the furnace
everyone goes silent stunned by the incredible turn of events
all eyes turn to zed and oh now standing before them on the center stage of the temple
they look at each other
someone has to say something
finally zed clears his throat
im the uh chosen one i guess and on behalf of well the whole city i want to thank the high priest for his incredible sacrifice
that was really something wasnt it
he starts clapping then oh starts clapping and soon all the people in the square are applauding
at that moment a single drop of rain falls and hits zed in the eye
he looks up a few more drops then a hard steady rain starts to fall
the people all look up in awe then someone cheers and they all roar in celebration
then the rain stops as suddenly as it started
the cheers die away and confused dissatisfied muttering begins
zed contd jumping in quickly people
okay that was a little confusing wasnt it
zed contd was that a sign from god
wasnt it a sign
whats the deal
we all want to know
but im not sure anybody really knows and id be real suspicious of people who say they do
if ive learned one thing its this the world and everything in it is a miracle
and what that miracle means is for each and every one of us to figure out for himself
are the gods going to destroy us
maybe i dont know i guess its possible
but if we keep going the way we are they wont have to
were doing a pretty good job of destroying ourselves
so maybe we should all just go home now and think about what happened and be very very good to each other
i know im going to try
raises his hand in salute to the people peace
the crowd stares at him blankly
nobody knows what to make of it all
then marlak shouts loud enough for all to hear
all hail the chosen one
with that the crowd explodes into rousing cheers
in the midst of the crowd abraham looks around and scowls
what am i
at the altar maya revived now embraces zed
youre incredible you know that
thats what ive been trying to tell you
zed and maya oh and eema stand there basking in the gratitude of the people as inanna looks on
a caravan is assembling making ready to leave the city
marlak enmebaragesi maya eema and the other villagers are there as well as a great number of freed slaves and hebrews
isaac is checking out mayas breasts
ever made it with a circumcised guy
marlak grunts at him and reaches for his knife
isaac contd is she with you
i did not realize that
marlak and maya cross to zed who is loading a packhorse
marlak looks at him for a long moment then punches him hard on the shoulder
you did good
zed waits for more but nothing comes
rubbing his shoulder well said marlak
you really have a way with words
they clasp hands
well tell stories about you around the fire
not much to tell is there
just an average guy who saw his destiny and had the courage to defy a powerful empire
no big deal
oh is at the front of the caravan giving orders but no one is listening to him
zed joins him
zed contd everybody ready
yeah just about i guess so
the hebrews are going to lead us to the sea and we can get boats from there
we can trade all this stuff everybody gave us for the trip home
i dont think i should be the leader
nobodys listening to me
by his side ill listen to you
oh swells up with pride
turns to zed come back to the village sometime
zed nods they shake hands then they embrace
stifling a tear oh breaks away and whips the lead camel
oh contd shouting at camel hee ya
beat quietly to camel come on
people are watching
the camel looks at him and slowly lumbers off
oh sighs gratefully and signals the caravan to follow
as the great caravan moves off zed is left standing there with nothing but a long staff and a bundle on the ground beside him to which is tied his
sword shield and helmet
maya joins him
where will you go now
might head down to egypt
i hear its a happening kinda place
are you going alone
you want to come
ill get my things
she gestures off and he sees a small train of camels and horses loaded with a ton of her personal possessions
maya contd the princess gave me a few gifts when she freed us
traveling light huh
okay here we go
to the west
correcting him thats west
i knew that
just wanted to see if you did
zed grins and they start walking passing a small herd of sheep and goats tended by veiled women going in the opposite direction
as the last of the shepherd women passes we notice something masculine about her build and posture
zed nods politely to her but she averts her eyes and turns away from him
in a high unconvincing womans voice peace brother
zed does a double take at the voice shrugs and walks off with maya as a torrential rain begins to fall
