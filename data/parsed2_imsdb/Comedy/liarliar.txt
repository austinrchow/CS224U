written by tom shadyac mike binder rough draft april two dozen kindgergartners listen to their teacher ms
the word work is on the blackboard
today were going to share what our parents do for work
quick cuts of a series of five year olds standing beside their desks addressing the class my dad is a truck driver
my mommy is a doctor
my dad is a librarian and my mom is a vegetarian
with difficulty my father is a struck sher al engine ear
my mother is an actress
she works at dennys
my daddy works at a place where they make stuff and my mommy is a mommy
looking a little my father is a postal worker
the quick cuts end with max my moms a teacher
as max starts to sit and your dad
taken aback a liar
i dont think you mean a liar
he wears a suit and goes to court and talks to the judge and oh
i see you mean hes a lawyer
fletcher reid early s stands before the judge
his manner is utterly genuine and convincing
a dark street
a stormy night
two desperate men struggle
one man is taken to the hospital the other to ja il
the prosecutor wants you to believe this is an open and shut case of a poor man brutally victimized
he nods at the victim a fragile old man in his s
well for once i agree with t he prosecutor
this is an open and shut case but the true victim is my client
fletchers client is a pound brute in a suit
put yourself in his shoes for a moment walking home from church alone in a frightening part of the suburbs
as he describes his clients movements fletcher acts them youre nervous timid looking over your shoulder when suddenly you encounter him pointing at the old man pouncing from the shadows
you quiver in fear
the streetlight flashes on something shiny in his hand a knife
suddenly fletcher becomes the attacker brandishing a weapon
the jurors recoil
and in that terrifying instant you do what any respectable citizen would you defend y ou rse lf
only after you shatter his arm and collarbone do you realize its all a mistake
the man was merely walking away from an atm machine the apparent flash of metal caused by his bank card
he reveals the weapon in his hand is only a credit card
as you stand over his crumpled though potentially still dangerous form your he art goes out to him
you want to help
first you gather up the many bills he dropped to stop them from bl owi ng away
second in an effort to get the name and number of someone to notify you take his wallet
finally you leap into the mans lexus to head for assistance when suddenly a police car speeds up
you breathe a sigh of relief someone to look after the injured man
but do the police applaud your initiative
do they hail your heroism
no they arrest you and throw you in the slammer
he walks along the jury box and why
why does the state turn its massive power against this individual
takes an moment then answers his own discrimination to a black but this time its not based on race
to a female not based on gender
to a man wearing a crucifix not based on religion to a heavy set no this time its discrimination based on size
i know what the prosecution wants you to think i t s always the big guys fault
is that what weve come to as a society persecuting people because theyre large
fletcher points accusingly at the opposition
shame on you mister prosecutor
shame on you
turning back to the state is trying to barbeque my client on the spit of justice
only you can douse the flames
the decision is your s
dont let your emotions run away with y ou
the fact that my client is a family man raising his sons alone after the tragic death of their mother has absolutely no bearing on this case
in the front row we see two sad faced young children
instead let cold reason be your guide as you decide the fate of this church going orphan rasing widower
fletcher returns to his seat
jurors dab their eyes
fletcher bounds down the stairs passing a fellow lawyer hows it going fletcher
he s won another gratifying day serving justice
fletchers huge client catches up to him
hey great job mr
i wish there was some way i could show my appreciation
stay out of my neighborhood after dark
a publicist carrying a clipboard approaches fletcher
reid do you have a moment
no im late picking up my son
because a couple of reporters want to interview you about your big win today
fletcher instantly shifts directions
hows my hair
and hes off to woo a gang of reporters
a sad max and his mother audrey wait silently on the steps
what time is it
checks her i m sure he just got tied up in court again
finally fletchers bmw pulls up
max races to him delighted
calls out a fletcher instantly becomes a human version of the transformer toy making robotic movements and sounds
max knows the routine well moves in perfect sine with dad
malfunction in vector
malfunction in vector
pretends to lose control of a robotic arm look out
its on tickle mode
fletchers mechanical arm becomes claw like tickling max like crazy
max loves it
audrey watches these two kids smiles
re audrey and who is this lovely lady
max could you introduce me
thats no lady thats mom
under his himnm
i dont remember her looking that good becomes the robot again malfunction in vector
malfunction in vector
fletchers other robotic arm becomes a pincher comes after audrey
keep vector away from me
unless you want vector chopped off
you know you were much easier when we were married
re her luggage so where are you off too
im delivering a paper
o h really
where i live we use a boy on a bike
hey mom dads taking me to see wrestling
mimicking her oh audrey
do you have to take him to tho se things
theyre so violent
fleccher imitates the familiar wise old indian chief dan the boy must learn the way of the war rior
an d wh o be tter to teach him than rowdy rod
piper and big john stud
audrey cant help but laugh
he must be schooled in the way of the face claw the sleeper hold and the purple nuxple
for only then shut up
to max the squaw will never understand us
a horn honks
its the good natured affable jerry
max runs up to him
max my man
jerry gives max five then kisses audrey on the lips
fletcher good to see you
no kiss for me
re luggage what do you say max
give me a hand
fletcher grits his teeth as jerry gives max a piggyback ride to get the luggage
to audrey i didnt know the boyfriend was going
his name is jerry and yes hes going
audrey heads inside
audrey enters shuts the blinds
t o stanford
does this mean you two are
cringes cant say the words ive been seeing him seven months what do you think
i was hoping that after being married to me youd have no more strength left
well you have to remember when we were married i wasnt having sex nearly as often as you were
ive been hit
audrey locks up
im so happy for you two
i am just mister h appy man
happy happy happy
it looks like jerrys taking that job offer in boston
fletcher turns sincere
aud i am so sorry
behind her back he flails in celebration
she glances back
he stops whistles innocently
calling to ready
audrey and jerry say goodbye to max
they get in his explorer
to audrey yo u gonna be okay
because if not we could leave max with your sister and i could go out with you two does that appeal to you at all
they drive off
wave to the soon to be ex boyfriend max
flipping max the you drive
fletcher is driving max beside him
dad are we really going to go to wrestling
we just have to stop by the office for one minute
hes heard this before
establishing the headquarters of allan stewart as they head inside fletcher and max pass a beggar
scuse me sir
do you have any change
patting his fraid not
fletcher grabs the daily journal paying for it with a handful of change
his son takes this in
on their way to the elevators fletcher and max pass philip a dweebish bore
and this must be max
trying to brush him off yes
yes it is
well it was good seeing you fletcher starts off with max when philip calls after him
you know ethel and i had a blast at our last little get together
oh me too
i can never get enough of charades
well have to do it again sometime
fletcher heads into an open elevator
only to find the doors closing impededby philips foot
the door again begins to close
when philip stops it
how bout tonight
not that soon
im taking max to see wrestling we love wrestling
we could i dont think so
see max is really shy around strangers
max looks up at fletcher
tell you what give me your card as a reminder
ill call y o u
philip hands him his card just as the door closes
max watches as his father tears philips card in two
the receptionist jane greets them
jane has an odd unattractive hairdo
a large gift basket is on her desk
indicates her what do you think
i love it
indicates the whats this
i dont know who sent it
but its for mr
its his anniversary
the partnership committee meeting still scheduled for friday
as she goes yep
fletcher quickly removes a gift card from his pocket scribbles on it puts it in place of the one already there what are you doing
fixing the card shows him the old card look they spelled mr
allans name wrong
have an apple
where a troubled fred rand is talking to miranda a beautiful steely partner
i cant do it
fred its your duty to present the strongest case possible
the strongest case possible consistent with the truth
let the judge decide whats true
thats what he gets paid for
you get paid to win
if you insist on my taking it to trial ill represent mrs
cole aggressively and ethically
but miranda i wont lie
miranda looks out her window calculating
then well just have to find someone whowill
fletcher strides through the hallway with max calling out greetings to his colleagues
max looks at pete whose fashion disaster tie startles him
thomas looks like youre losin weight
thomas glances up from a file
max notes that hes corpulent
gained three pounds
wedging past on you it works
fletcher arrives at his office
we meet his secretary the fiftyish
worldly wise and world weary greta
its my birthday tomo rrow
were having a party and everything
flet chers eyes widen
he has clearly forgotten
im sure your dad give you something wonderful
fletcher tries to wave her off awkwardly stopping when max turns to him
youre going to love it
uh why dont you play in my office for a minute
fax something sue someone have a good time
well be leaving in a second
max heads into the office
fletcher closes the door behind him turning it into a silly two handed wave
i completely forgot
oh theres a surprise
greta produces a wrapped gift
youre a saint
i should get you something
she holds up another smaller package
well i always do the classy thing
she hands him a stack of mail
judge pattersons clerk
he needs your filing
tell him its in the mail
jotting down a right

mckinley phoned questioning that fourteen hours you billed on christinas eve

jotting down a note
your mother called

jotting down a break mothers heart
and thats it except mirandas looking for you
checking watch as if i dont have anything better to do than bow and scrape at her royal perfumed p artner feet
tell her im in court
tell her i broke my leg and had to be shot
why dont you tell her yourself
as miranda approaches fletcher switches gears in an and then send out a notice of judgement on my win today
ill get right on it
fletcher turns and pretends to be surprised
i didnt see you
hey you look lovely today
here i bought you a gift
he grabs gretas gift and hands it to miranda
i heard about your victory today
youre making quite an impression on the partnership committee
oh thats right
you folks are meeting again soon
allan stewart konigsberg and ried
theres something about the rhythm of fours
its like a full measure
well anyway ive got a client waiting in my office actually something important h as come up
youre not busy tonight are you
before fletcher answers we a sad max sits on fletchers big sofa
his heart sinks further when fletcher enters
carrying two boxes of documents
were not going are we
of course we are
a promise i s a promise
we are gonna see wrestling or my name isnt fletcher t
to wrestler could you hand me that
the wrestler thank you
without looking we are having some fun eh maxer

i just wanted to say good night to max but he must still be out with fletcher hangs up will you marry me
what did you say
i proposed i
look i know this boston thing is a great opportunity good job mo ney
but i started to think about being three thousand miles away from you and max
and i didnt like it
i look i know its a lot to ask to move and everything but i
i love you
i love your son
will you marry me
she stares at him excited but nervous
early morning outside fletchers building
fletcher types on his computer
hes been up all night
he leans back rubs his eyes
when he opens them he sees max standing there in pajamas
how old are you today
t h ir t y
well youve held up well
i only wish there was some way to commemorate such an occasion some small symbol to mark this day like
fletcher produces a present
max eyes it with wonder
what is it
no idea its
it hits him a surprise
max knows his father doesnt have a clue but he rips the box open revealing a baseball glove dodgers cap and baseball stuff
hugging his dad will you play catch with me
after your party you have my word on it
max nods sadly as fletcher turns back to his work
jerry and audrey are driving
audreys holding a couple of airline tickets
re tickets jerry these are for tomorrow
the company wants me to get started right away
i cant just pick up and move to boston with two days notice
ju st come check it out
you a nd max see the town
lets pick out a place together
then if you want to turn me down and scar me for life fine
its just not that simple
what about my job
ive been at ucla three years
its new england
theyre lousy with colleges
you cant swing a bat back there without hitting a college
youd get a job there in a second
there are other factors involved
t here they are now
they pull up in front of fletchers building where fletcher and max are waiting
fletchers still reviewing a file
as audrey gets out of jerrys car max runs over
did you have fun
how were the wrestling matches
am i right maxie
it was fun
re audrey so how were the wrestling matches
did you have fun
max my man
my happy birthday man
max and jerry exchange fives anda hug
jerry gives max a light punch on the arm

the seventeenth of may is the day i
remind myself that the eighteenth is maxs birthday
see you tonight
they drive away
miranda and fletchers new client virginia cole an alluring woman in her early thirties review the document he spent the previousnight putting together
this is good
this is really smart
only i t s
like not true
every word of it is a lie
fletcher and miranda exchange glances
isnt that a problem
cole the only problem here is that after youve provided years of faithful service and loving support of raising his children they are his
one for sure
after all that your husband wants to deny you a fair share of the marital assets based on one single act of seven
seven single acts of indiscretion
seven acts of indiscretion only one of which he has any evidence of and all of which he himself is responsible for
cole i stayed up all night last night studying your c ase
not just your case
b ut you
and by now i feel i know you
you are the victim here
the wife of a cold distant businessman
starved for affection driven into the arms of another man seven
not missing a seven
youre not trying to deny him what is r ig htf ull y his
all youre insisting on is what is r ig htf ull y yours
and maybe an idgy smidgy bit more
i think youre bending over backwards
well i did agree to give him j oint custody of the kids
to miranda hes always been a good father
and youve always been a good wife
getting worked yeah
theres such a thing as being t oo nice
thats why you need aggr essive representation
to show the court that there is more than one side to this st ory
all im asking is the opportunity to see that justice is done on your behalf
takes her hand will you give me that opportunity
he stares into her eyes
a moment then
i m tired of getting kicked around
good for you
thank you mr
i m so grateful i have an attorney i can trust
s he gives him a hug and momentarily grabs his ass
with a farewell nod to miranda she leaves
miranda turns smiles at fletcher then shuts the door
she moves in on him
youre really good
pronounces it with the p she picks a piece of lint off
n o i mean it
the cole case is worth a truckload of money to this firm not to mention the press its going to g en er at e
you win this case and i guarantee youll make partner
his tie actually how would you like to make a partner right now
she grabs his lapels and pulls him in for a deep kiss
a party in progress kindergartners being entertained by a man in a clown suit and clown make up
captain fuzzy is my name making children happy is my game with a shake and a juggle and a big belt buckle youll all be glad i came
he flops down on his back causing something in his pants to honk
audrey and jerry watch
indicating the what do you think
well if you dont hire your brother who will
she heads into
they called me again from b oston
they really want me there tomorrow
i cant go to boston
hell love it there
i cant move max three thousand miles away from his father
audrey i have never said a bad word about your ex i know
but how much responsibility does fletcher take for max now
hed never come over if you didnt remind him
but if theyre three thousand miles apart theyll never see each other
fletcher will never come to boston and how can i send max cross country to him
so because your ex husband is unreliable we cant i know its not logical its emotional
i still want to marry you
are you sure
jerry picks up the phone pulls out a piece of paper dials
into phone mr
crisitelli jerry she
i hope im not calling too late
crisitelli im afraid i have to turn down your offer
so am i
well ive fallen in love with this beautiful woman in l
and she doesnt want to leave and i wont leave without her
well thank you very much
yes good bye
hangs up he wasnt there but thats the speech i wouldve made
she smiles and kisses him
the phone rings
fletcher where are you
were getting ready to cut the cake
urn actually something has come up
a problem on a new caaa
miranda bites one of fletchers nipples
a h h h
i just nailed my knee into the desk
listen im really sorry i cant make it
max is going to be so disappointed
ill make it up to him i promise
ill pick him up from school tomorrow okay
do you want me to put him on the phone
miranda starts reeling in the phone cord
i have to go
angrily she hangs up
fletcher stares unhappily at the phone before miranda throws him back onto the couch
we pan down from banners reading happy birthday max
to a room full of guests
to a desultory five year old
audrey finishes lighting the candles on the homemade cake
all right birthday boy make a wish
max doesnt respond
it can be anything whatever you want most in the world
doesnt respond she leans down to him
max your dad is sorry
he had to work
he said he was coming
yes well he
promises hell see you tomorrow
max doesnt believe it
i wish for just one day dad couldnt tell a lie
he takes a breath and blows out all the candles
a strange wind blows the drapes and the wisp of smoke up up up
to the clock on the wall
a clock on a wall
we are pan around mirandas office where the displaced sofa is adorned with fletchers shoes
to the credenza where fletchers pants hang
to the lamp where fletchers shorts swing
to the desk where a ravished miranda lies next to fletcher
superbly confident of the answer she asks s o
was it good for you
without thinking fletcher responds in the most astonishing way possible he tells the truth
ive had better
miranda turns to him in disbelief but its nothing compared to the look of shock on fletchers face
the door opens and the naked fletcher is forcefully kicked out
he goes tumbling over a desk as a rain of clothes follow
the door slams shut again leaving him without his pants
a cleaning lady stares at him in shock then takes her broom aims for his crotch swings
an alarm clock rings
fletcher bolts up in bed
with regret and wonder he remembers ive had better
fletcher brushes his teeth looks up at his reflection in the mirror mouth foaming
ive had better
dressed for work fletcher waits for the elevator
laughing it off ive had better
i t arrives
he steps in
the elevator is empty except for fletcher
and a beautiful young woman
new in the building
i just moved in monday
well you must allow me to give you the grand tour
do you do that for all the new tenants
just the ones i want to bang like a drum
fletchers face registers extreme shock and
we hear a smack off camera and a ping as the elevator door opens
the model storms off and a stunned fletcher steps out rubbing his freshly slapped face
a shaky fletcher strides toward the courthouse
when he is accosted by a beggar
any change mister
but he continues walking
could you spare some
fletcher walks faster puzzled that he has answered truthfully
the beggar is even more puzzled
because i resent your p re sen ce
you fill me with an unpleasant mixture of disgust and guilt
further i dont believe youll use the money for food but i believe youll use it for at worst drugs or at best whiskey or cigarettes
also im cheap
as fletcher heads up the stairs
a winded fletcher joins virginia at the respondents table you look like youre having a rough morning
ive had better
he winces as he recognizes the words
then an extremely wealthy respectable industrialist richard cole enters with his attorney dana appleton young brisk confident
good morning fletcher
all right virginia how much will it take to put an end to this
fifty per cent of your estate
richard is shocked
fifty per cent
with a pre nup and proof of adultery
whats your case
our case is simply this
fletcher opens his mouth to enlighten her but he cant get the words out
he tries to force out sounds but succeeds only in looking like a fish gasping on dry land
interesting though based on your track record i expected a little more
nearing panic fletcher whirls to his briefcase and grabs the brief
ive got it in writing
but when dana tries to take the document the astonished fletcher finds himself physically unable to release it
he involuntarily snatches the document away and it pulls him to a nearby trash can where he throws it out
at this moment the bailiff calls
all rise for the honorable judge william stevens
very funny fletcher
you want to play hardball im game
judge stevens takes the bench
calling case ba richard cole versus virginia cole
howre we doing this morning counsel
fine thank you
and you mr
well im a little upset about a bad sexual episode i had last night fletcher screeches to a standstill suddenly aware of what he just said
after an awkward silence well youre still young
itll happen more and more
in the meantime what do you say we get
down to business
reid i see that your client was previously represented by mr
rand of your office
yes your honor
i take it youre seeking to substitute in as counsel
yes your honor
and for the record the reason is
rand had severe ethical objections to my clients case
fletcher is incredulous
somehow his greatest asset in the world his mouth has become his worst enemy
i take it you dont share the same ethical objections mr
i have lower standards your honor
well if mrs
cole wants the substitution of counsel ill allow it
is that what you want mrs
virginia looks to the judge then to fletcher whose unorthodox syle seemed so brilliant earlier
aside to what are you doing
i dont know
to judge with your honor i d like a continuance
this case has already been delayed several times mr
i realize that your honor but i d really really really like a continuance
ill have to hear good cause counselor
whats the problem
the room begins to spin slowly then faster then faster until we wind up squarely on i cant lie
reid but im still waiting for the good caus e
now do you have it or not
motion for a continuance denied
is there any chance of a settlement in this case
i dont think so your honor
reid made it abundantly clear that the last thing in the world he wanted was to dana and mr
cole look at fletcher with surprise
there appears to have been a change in strategy
lets go to my chambers and negotiate
he bangs the gavel
dana and an apprehensive fletcher sit before the judge your honor under the terms of the prenuptual agreement if mrs
cole commits adultery she is entitled to nothing
we have in our possession an audiotape made by a licensed private investigator of an explicit act of sexual congress with a man who is not her husband
sounds pretty damning mr
it certainly does
however my client has no desire to see his ex wife destitute
against my advice hes willing to offer her a cash settlement of
two point four million dollars
two four seems like a pretty fair offer mr
in fact id say beyond fair bordering on stupid
the judge finds fletchers boldness refreshing
what are you suggesting mr
appletons willingness to proffer such an offer betrays a lack of faith in her position
utterly sincere no not at all
shes got my client dead to rights
when attorneys go to sleep at night they dream of having a case as strong as hers
can the sarcasm reid
all right i admit it ive seen you make even the lamest case fly
but this time i have you
even clarence darrow couldnt explain this away
she brandishes the audiotape
wel l mr
without a dynamite explanation id say youre dead in the water
hows you clients story
the best that money can buy y o u r honor
strong corroborating evidence
we have evidence that you are not going to believe
despite herself dana is beginning to look worried
youre pretty confident how this trial is going to come out eh mr
confident is too weak a word your honor
i am certain what will happen if i take this puppy to trial
the verdict will be a stunning humiliating defeat that will cut a spectacularly promising legal career off at the knees
fletcher is referring to himself of course but dana thinks hes speaking about her
double the offer
four point eight
and not a penny more
venomous to bastard
she storms out leaving an astounded fletcher behind
you are some negotiator mr
if your client has half a brain shell jump at the offer
we are fletcher has joined virginia at the respondents table no
cole this offer was a miracle
im talking about a walking on water lazarus rising from the dead dmv miracle
youve gone from two point four to four point eight million in
checks his four minutes
think of it this way now youre getting paid seven hundred thou per schtupp
reid you convinced me yesterday im the victim here starved for affection driven into the arms of another man seven
seven other men
with the story you came up with i dont think i can lose
i want to proceed
cole you dont
understand i but before fletcher can finish the judge enters
do we have a settlement
fletcher looks pleadingly at his client but she is firm
he shakes his head unhappily
the judge is irritated
th ere s no settlement
trial to start at one thirty sharp
he bangs the gavel
fletcher emits an involuntary whimper
da zed fletcher makes his way down the hall
jane comes toward him wearing a hairstyle that resembles a nest
he tries to avoid her but
what do you think
i think you need help
horrifi ed fletcher hurries on
the heavyset thomas ambulates in his way
whats shakin fletcher
your cellulite tubster
the now panicked fletcher breaks into a run passing fred
hiy a fletcher
hows the cole case going
not stopping straight into the crapper you wuss with my career right behind it
fletcher is running now covering his ears and singing loudly so as not to hear other employee greetings
fletcher speeds past hi boss
whats happening and races into his office
he leans against the door trying to catch his breath
do nt panic
you can beat this its all a matter of willpower
he dives for his desk and rifles through it
he holds up a blue pen
focus with great the color of this pen is r
the color of this pen is blue
burying his ahhhh
one tiny lie and i cant say it
suddenly sitting ill write
he takes a sheet of paper his pen and writes this pen i s
he tries to write an r but cant
s tr ain s harder
hes out of his chair on the desk
his feet kick over objects on the shelvesbehind him
he finally forces pen to paper
he looks down where he wrote this pen is blue
greta enters to find fletcher running around the office shaking the blue pen in the air
boss whats wrong
the pen is blue
the pen is
b l u e
the goddamn pen is almost weeping he collapses into a chair
a moment then greta tentatively offers him a red pen
oh thats easy for you to say
are you all right
getting up i have to go home
was the case settled
i have to be in court at one thirty
well then how can you
i dont know i dont know
walking on before i forget rubin and dun n called
they want to know where the darvis settlement offer stands
i only proposed a settlement t o dick with them
i never had any intention of going th ro ug h with it
not certain why her boss would
shoot himself in the foot greta nonetheless jots down his remarks
dick with them
your accountant philip called to remind you about getting together
id rather shave my ass and sit in vinegar
jotting down a got it
and your mother called again
are you still on vacation
nodding yes no
so then youre here
shaking his head yes
i m having a little trouble following you
what do i say to your mom
tell her im a thoughtless son whod rather spend ten hours clogging the wheels of justice than five minutes talking to her but only if she asks
might also add that she deserves better though i hope to god you dont
thanks for clearing that up
and thats it except your ex called and asked when you were cowing over to see your son
he reacts particularly stunned by this truth
audrey is driving max who wears his new baseball uniform when her cellular phone rings
she picks it up
we intercut between car and office
t was wondering if you were going to still pick up max after school today
i dont think i can
i had a case i was certain would settle and it didnt
i have to go to trial this afternoon god help me
not believing right
i really do want to see max today
fletcher considers what he just said realizes it is true
how about that
i really do
but things keep coming up at the last minute
yes but this time its different
and how is that
he walked into this time im telling the truth
but last night you werent
what were you doing
barely holding her temper it must have been with someone very special
it was with someone i dont even like
but i thought it would help my career and at the moment that seemed more important than attending my sons birthday
m y god
she slams down the phone
fletcher bangs the phone against his head in frustration
the volvo parks
audrey gets out
she leans over to say good bye to her son
is dad picking me up
no im sorry max
he cant make it
ill work it out
max is disappointed
i guess my wish didnt come true
i wished that for just one day dad couldnt tell a lie
max heads toward his teacher
audrey is deeply moved
hes dialing the phone
answer answer answer
audrey let me explain
something has happened to me fletcher something else is about to happen to you
what do you mean
max and i are moving to boston
jerry asked me to marry him
he wants max and i to fly with him this weekend to pick out a house
and im going to go
god knows i dont have any reason to stay here
wait you cant move
if you take max away
ill practically never see him
well then youll have pretty much the same relationship you have with him now
is this because of what i just said on the phone
that was the straw and this is the camels back saying goodbye
where are you
when you gee there stay there
ill be right over
we have to talk
ill be right there
he hangs up and heads for the door
it opens and miranda enters
fletcher fletcher fletcher
i must confess after last nights incident i was
i was tempted to do whatever little things lie in my power to scuttle your chances of making partner
fletcher is frightened
but then i thought no that s not fair
fletcher didnt mean to insult me
his tie it was just some massive boneheaded misunderstanding and fletcher is very very sorry
it looks like hes off the hook until isnt that right fletcher
in agony uh not really no
stunned angry n o
what are you sayi ng
have you no respect for me
i mean i d like to respect you and if it werent for your mistreatment of the associates your rudeness to the staff and the fact that your work sucks
but what about last night
i was afraid you wouldnt support my partnership if i turned you down
plus i have an immature need for sexual conquests
w e hear a smack
the door flies opens and a furious miranda stalks off
fletcher rubs his freshly slapped faci
fletcher speeds away
he pulls the blue pen from his pocket
hes so preoccupied that he speeds through a crosswalk and almost hits an old man
the color of the pen is re d
but he hasnt regained the ability to lie hes referring to the red light he just ran nearly colliding with a truck
the driver screams whats your problem schmuck
the truth i m an inconsiderate prick
fletcher once again focuses on the blue pen
cmon you can do this
the color of the pen is red
this time hes referring to the flashing red light of a police car in his rearview mirror
s hi t
fletcher pulls over
a police officer strolls up
do you know why i stopped you
depends on how long you were following me
why dont we take it from the top
in agony here goes i didnt fasten my seatbelt i didnt glance in my rearview mirror i didnt signal when i pulled away from the curb i sped i followed
too closely i ran a stop sign i almost hit a chevy camaro i almost hit a ge ezer i sped some more i failed to yield at a crosswalk i changed lanes in the intersection i changed lanes without signalling and i changed lanes in the signalling while running a red light and speeding
a long moment
may i see your drivers license
and why is that
its in my other pants
and where are your other pants
hanging from my bosss credenza
do you expect me to believe that
do you think im an idiot
yes but thats beside the point
my license actually is in my other pants and they actually were hanging from a credenzaj i wouldnt lie to you
i mean i would if i could but i cant
have no reason to try and hide your license from me
i didnt say that
i have other reasons
seventeen reasons to be precise
begrudgingly off the officers look unpaid parking tickets
a cab speeds up to the house
fletcher runs out
audrey is headed to her car
you know i just had an insight into myself
i m crazy
you call me up and
tell me to wait here because youll be right over and heres the crazy part i actually wait
i can explain i missed a department meeting
did you come in a cab
wheres your car
audrey finishes paying the impound yard cashier and joins fletcher who is waiting alongside hundreds of towed cars
i cant tell you how much this means to me
one thousand six hundred and fifty four dollars and eleven cents
at this moment we hear a hideous scraping noise and a tow yard employee whips fletchers bmw into view and
revealing a prominent new scrape on the door
you scratched my car
that was already there
why you you liar
do you know what i m going to do about this
angrier and nothing
because if i take you to small claims court it will just drain eight hours out of my life and you probably wont show up and if i finally got
the judgment youd just stiff me anyway so what im gonna do is piss and moan like an impotent jerk and then bend over and take it up the tail pipe
youve been here before havent you
he flips fletcher the keys and goes
well i cant remember when ive had more fun now if youll excuse me i have a class
she starts out
i want to talk to you about this boston situation
what do you want to say
you cant go
its not fair
taking max three thousand miles away is not fair
let s define fair
last night a five year old boy was crushed because his father lied to him about coming to his birthday party
last night was none of my business
when it happened two years ago it was my business but now i dont have to care anymore
see thats the magic of div orce
but it does matter to max
everything you do matters to him
and everything you dont do
all right now let me tell you something
youre absolutely right
im guilty of all charges
im throwing myself on the mercy of your court
audrey doesnt know what to say
fletcher seems very sincere but she cant trust him
i have an idea
ill come over tonight right after court lets out and play with m ax
have him invite some fri ends over
well have a game and everything
then you and i can sit down and talk
were suppose to be on a plane no audrey
just talk to me abou t this first
au drey ive lost you
dont make me lose max too
youre really coming
this is iron clad
this is the mother of all promises
ten to six
only if i tell max youre coming and you dont show up and i have to see that look on maxs face that heartbreaking look its boston fletcher
i will be there
as audrey gets in her car
i hope so
do you know what your son was doing at nine fif teen las t ni ght
he was making a wish on his birthday c ake
he was wishing that for just one day his dad couldnt tell a lie
she drives away
fletcher starts for his car pensive when a new thought strikes him
oh my god
that s it
an innocent kid a heartfelt plea a birthday wish
sure it s impossible but it makes sense
if he can wish it he can unwish it
fletcher marches quickly down the hall cake box under his arm
berrys reading a story when fletcher enters
are you maxs dad
i m ms
berry maxs teacher
listen i need to talk to mr
reid we were just talking ab ou t careers
youre a lawyer arent you
reid itwould be wonderful for the children to hear something positive about lawyers
well actually children
reid is going to tell us what its like to be a lawyer
she leads the kids in applause
fletcher takes center s tage
the children stare rapt with attenion
uh im a lawyer and i work at a big law firm with a lot of other lawyers and i do stuff in a law court
he starts out
one moment mr
maybe some of the children have hands shoot up jeffrey
what kind of lawyer are you
mostly i m a divorce lawyer
it means if youre daddy left your mommy hed call me
so what do you do
growing more and more impatient i help people fight over their money and their children
cant they fight without you
they could but then j wouldnt make a living
why would my daddy leave my mommy
to marry a younger woman
to escape a loveless marriage and have cheap meaningless sex
to cling to an illusion of youth as his body gives way to sore backs flat feet spare tires gum disease hair loss liver spots kidney stones clogged arteries diabetes
goiter and eventual death
the kids eyes go wide
a moment then well i think its time for fingerpainting
theyre in the playground just outside the classroom
you came to play catch
i d like to but i cant right now
max is disappointed again
i m sorry i missed your party la st night
how was your uncle glen
his big nose and stupid orange hair
thats why he should have worn make up
fletcher elbows max playfully trying to induce a laugh
max doesnt laugh
i want to play kickball with my friends
yeah okay urn
your mother told me about
the wish you made last night
it came true
max is amazed
you mean you have to tell the truth
no matter what
no matter what
max grins then suddenly asks in rapid succession
is wrestling real
in the olympics yes
will sitting close to the tv set make me go blind
not in a million years
if i keep making this face makes a horrible will it get stuck that way
if i go in the water right after lunch will i drown
only if you cant swim
why do i have to eat squash
because your mom buys it
how come youre always too busy to play with me
the sudden shift in tone startles fletcher
he feels awful
i dont know
hey you know im coming over to nig ht
were gonna play together
this is absolutely an a number one promise
you and i tonight baseball
fletcher and max do their ritual five slap
now listen max i need a favor from you
i m in a little trouble today
i need you to take that wish back
so you can lie
not to you
max sometimes grownups
need to lie
its hard to explain but i f
look heres an example
when mommy was pregnant with you she gained a little weight
se venty pounds
i thought she was gonna give birth to a car
but shed say to me how do i lo ok
so id say oh honey youre beautiful youre glowing
otherwise i wouldve hurt mommys fee ling s
you didnt think she was beautiful
max i dont know how to get along in the grown up world if i have to stick to the truth
i could lose my case i could lose my promotion i could even lose my job
do you understand
max shakes his head no
will you help me anyway
a moment then max reluctantly nods
thats my boy
fletcher opens the box revealing a cake and candles
he takes out two birthday hats
he puts one on max and one on himself
now do whatever you did last night
only this time make an un wish
not really happy max turns to the candles on the cake
he takes a breath and blows them out
i did it
now to test fletcher spots an attractive female teacher
fletcher hurries to her and says something
then she fletcher returns to his son
did it work
rubbing his sore not like i d hoped
did you really unwish it
yesterday when i wished it i r ea lly meant it
this time when i unwished it i only did it cause you told me to
losing patience well then do it again
only this time mean it
because i dont want you to lie
i explained this to you
i have to lie
mommy lies even the wonderful jerry lies but youre the only one who makes me feel bad
fletcher is stunned by how much this hurts
max recess is over come on in
i have to go
i am coming over tonight max
you believe me dont you
max hesitates then nods
ill see you tonight buddy
thats a promise
max heads back to class
fletcher picks up the cake looks at it then dumps it in a trash barrel
a worried and preoccupied fletcher is heading toward his office building when a macho attorney passes by
hows it hanging
short and shrivelled
fletcher hurries up the steps when he spots philip
he shields his face with his briefcase
philip recognizes him anyway
im still waiting for your call
i guess you mustve lost my card no or my phone was busy no or you just forgot no cannot be or something
so anyway why dont you swing by my place around seven thirty
philip starts off when fletcher calls after him resolutely
i dont want to come over to your house
a long moment then fi n e
well go out
theres this new karaoke bar ive been dying to try
ill pick you up at your office
and he runs off
frustrated fletcher hurries on
fletcher drags himself past gretas desk
miranda gives him the stink eye
fletcher doesnt see her
do you want your messages
he goes into his office
greta is concerned
she follows him in leaving his door open
fletcher collapses onto his couch
are you okay
my son hates me
he loves you
ive seen y ou together
youre his hero
o h yeah
last night at his birthday party he made a wish
that i wouldnt be able to tell a lie for one whole day
it came true
didnt it seem odd to you that i kept telling the truth all morning
well yeah but
youre telling me that you cant lie
i am incapable of lying
miranda is eavesdropping
a wicked gleam in her eye just today
apparently until tonight
its a twenty four hour curse
yes those are going around
you dont believe me
of course not
ask me something i d normally lie about
a ll right
remember a few months ago i wanted a raise forget it
lets not do this
and the firm wouldnt
give me one
and i asked you if you would give it to me out of your own pocket and you said the company wouldnt permit it because it creates jealousy among the
was that true or did you just not want to pony up the dough
greta is emptying all her personal effects into boxes
fletcher is on the phone and looks very harras sed
into phone yes judge stevens hi
i m scheduled to be in your court in half an hour
judge stevens i badly badly need a continuance
so i can go home and stay there the rest of the day

greta holds up a framed photograph

the phone rings

hold on please pushes two hello
the phone flies into the air
he catches it
well i wasnt actually on vacation
because i didnt want to talk to you
because you insist on talking to me about dads bowel movements size color frequency
ill call you later
no not really
he pushes two more buttons
i cut him off
i cut off the judge
he falls to his knees
im on my knees in a nine hundred dollar suit
she seems to consider
a few years ago a friend of mine had a burglar up on her roof
he fell through the kitchen skylight and landed on a cutting board on a butchers knife cutting his l e g
he sued my friend
the burglar sued my friend
thanks to guys like you he won
my friend had to pay him six thousand dollars
is that justice
but what s your poijit
my point is its hard to get justice
but this is justice pinches his have a nice day in court bubbie
fletcher starts to give chase
he runs directly into miranda
miranda smiles like a cat thats trapped a mouse
ah fletcher so nice to bump i nto you
are you busy
would you follow me please
highly nervous fletcher follows miranda down the hall
fletcher did you know that the partnership committee is being headed up by mr
off his wary say you used to work directly for mr
allan didnt you
off his waried tell me what do you think of him
hes a pedantic pontificating pretentious bastard a belligerent old fart a worthless steaming pile of cow dung
she swings open a door ushering fletcher into the room is filled with attorneys including mr
allan the founder himself
pardon me for interrupting your meeting
allan you remember fletcher reid
its good to see you again fletcher
an involuntary whimper from fletcher
oh thats right

fl etc he r gulps
this is it
his career is history
hes trying to hold it back but i said
what do you think of mr
hes a pedantic pontificating pretentious bastard a belligerent old fart a worthless steaming pile of cow dung
de an silence
allan bursts into raucous laughter
he is joined by everyone except miranda who looks on stunned
everyone pounds the table in hysterics
thats what i love most about this firm the collegial atmosphere the hearty good fellowship
miranda is incensed
and thanks for those flowers for my anniversary
my wife loved them
well im due in court
fletcher exits the conference closes the door breathes a sigh of relief then faints
close up of fletcher seated alone at a table
his hands are on his face
he looks totally dazed
at the other table sit dana appleton and mr
judge stevens enters
counselors are we ready to begin
eagerly and a little too n o sir
we are not ready to b eg in
my client has not arrived
the doors open and virginia cole enters with her children and a nanny
he collapses into his chair
to falk with did you and mrs
cole ever make lo forni roll in the h make the beast with two ba did you two ever fu fu fu
he begins to hyperventilate
virginia turns to falk
get him water
falk hurries into the building as fletcher hacks on
fu fu s it down
get some air
slaps him on the try to relax
falk hurries out with a cup hands it to fletcher who downs it in one gulp then spews it out again screaming in pain
i couldnt find any water so i got him coffee
fletcher runs up and down the steps frantically fanning h is scalded mouth
the bailiff appears
judge is taking the bench
fletchers expression turns to terror
the judge settles in
allan and a smug miranda look on from the gallery
you may proceed mr
everyone turns to fletcher in anticipation
in a voice quaking with fear
one of the kids threw up in the car
virginia takes her seat leaving her two young children sitting dejectedly in the gallery with their nanny
you brought your kids
to your divorce
by way of sympathy
well its working
i feel sorry for them already
the judge bangs the gavel
appleton you may begin
dana appleton questions bryson a private investigator
fletcher watches with mounting anxiety nervously drinks from a glass of water at his table
referring to his from march six through june twelve i surveilled mrs
cole at the behest of mr
during that period i noted that mr
cole left each day between seven forty and seven fifty
cole would frequently have a male visitor arrive and stay for one to four hours
i was able to take several photographs of the male visitor
he shows a photo o f a strapping hunk
fletcher takes a i see
and do you
know what mrs
cole and her male visitor did during their frequent
well they were pretty good about keeping the shades drawn but i sure was able to hear
i made an audiotape of one such
h e hands her the tape
fletcher refills his glass
with the courts permission i would like to play the tape
your honor i object
and why is that mr
cant help because its devastating to my case
the judge is startled by his candor
as dana pops the tape into a player fletcher anxiously periodically cutting to virginia mr
cole dan and the thirsty fletcher we hear virginia and her visitor engaged in intense physical activity
so what did you say
oh boy am i ready
let me help you off with that
come on lie down
wai t a minute
do you have protection
okay now i m gonna show you something new
oh ive never done it like this before
dont worry you can take it
there you go
we hear labored rhythmic breathing
yes yes yes as dana fast forwards again then resumes
with still more labored breathing building intensity and oh yeah bring it on
the groans reach their incredible climax
theres a still moment
as the shy court reporter the macho bailiffs and the no nonsense judge all mop their brows dana shuts off the tape
she turns to fletcher with a satisfied smile
afraid to ask no questions
all right mr
you may proceed
to himself how
gathering his courage he stands downs the last of his water and moves to the lecturn
hes about to speak
when a wonderful feeling sweeps through him
after a momement he grins
would the court be willing to grant me a short bathroom break
it cant wait
not unless you want to mop up
all right but get back in here immediately so
we can finish this
then necessity compels him to race out
fletcher stands before the urinal taking the longest leak i n legal history
then he looks at his watch
what did i think
that i could piss for forty five minutes
he hits his forehead in frustration
and gets an idea
he hits himself again and again smashes his head into the wall pokes himself in the eyes yanks on his ears finally knocks himself in the stall where he continues
a man enters hears a commotion from behind the stall door
whats going on in there
i m abusing myself
do you mind
the man looks disgusted
he carefully leaves the room
the judge is pissed
suddenly the bailiff helps in the severly beaten fletcher
the entire courtroom is shocked
i found him like this in the bathroom
somebody beat the hell out of him
who did this
a madman your honor
a desperate fool at the end of his pitiful
what did he look like
about five eleven hundred eighty five pounds crazed look in his eye
bailiff have the deputies search the building
a hubbub rises
he bangs the gavel
under the circumstances i have no choice but to recess this case until tomorrow morning at nine
fletcher smiles serenly until unless of course you think you can still proceed
fletcher covers his mouth in a desperate attempt to avoid answering but he cant repress the truth
yes i can
i admire your courage mr
ill give you a few minutes to compose yourself and then well get started
fletcher looks as if he has just been sentenced to death
fletcher sits on the courthouse steps miserable
summoning up maxi pad
hows it going
you know paul and emanuel from across the street
well they never want to play baseball with me but i told them i was gonna play tonight with my dad so now they want to play with us
is it okay
were setting up a whole field in the yard
where we buried petey the hamster is second base
fletcher sighs youre still coming right
sees virginia i be there
i gotta go now max
ill see you in two hours
max hangs up
to audrey hes really coming
she smiles but shes worried
virginia approaches with her handsome lover laurence falk
reid you remember laurence falk the man from the tape
how are you
ive slipped into the seventh circle of hell thank you and you
virginia exchanges an anxious look with falk
shouldnt we go over our testimony
well basically the plan is i walk you through the tape step by step i ask you questions and we give the explanation you came up with
so all we have to do is lie
sounds simple enough
do esnt it
and ill finish up with a dramatic series of questions something like
falk isnt it true that you and mrs
cole have never made lo but fletcher gags
he cant get the question out
the others look concerned but he waves them off
falk isnt it true that you and mrs
cole have never made lo to his horror he gags again
unable to form the word
to himself oh my god
i cant do it
i cant finish the question if i know the answer is a lie
at this moment miranda and mr
allan come up the steps
dont let me interrupt fletcher
i just want you to know ill be observing this a fternoon
miranda insisted i see you in action
fletcher shoots a hateful look at miranda
im looking forward to it
go get em
allan and miranda head into the building leaving fletcher more desperate than before
gotta rephrase the question
fletchers clears his throat
falk do you know my client virginia cole
isnt it true that your relationship with my client is entirely platonic not
the not was involuntary
it takes everyone by surprise
if i might rephrase your honor
trying again is your relationship with my client entirely patonic not
is your relationship with my client not entirely platonic
is not your relationship with my client entirely platonic
thinks hes got it beams with mr
falk is not your relationship with my client entirely platonic
i mean yes
yes is your relationship with my client not entirely platonic or yes is not your relationship with my client entirely platonic
how bout just answering the question you think im asking
your honor hes badgering the wintness
its hig witness
did you ever not make lo did you not ever make lo losing it falk looks shaken as fletcher barrels on unable to stop screaming at breaking down a gasp
from the audience
all eyes are on fletcher
no further questions
to fletcher call your next witness
i have no further witnesses your honor
a murmur erupts from the crowd
you have no further witnesses
fletcher meekly shakes his head no
whispers to what are you doing
to virginia i cant
call me damn it
you dont understand
i cant lie
until nine sixteen tonight i cant even
ask a question that calls for a lie
virginia grabs him by the tie pulls him close to her face
l is ten you bastard
i want m y money
i am not gonna wind up a year old divorce on welfare because my scum bag attorney had a sudden attack of conscience
fletcher suddenly stops focused on something virginia said
to himself thirty one
reid were not getting any younger
fletcher quickly looks at the blowup of virginias prenup and her passport
hes had it mr
reid you have presented virtually nothing in the way of evidence and as such i have no choice but to rule in favor of silence
your honor i call virginia cole to the stand
stunned virginia nervously makes her way up in the gallery what the hell is he doing
kissing his career goodbye
the baliff stands before the witness
do you swear to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you god
confident now cocky
cole may i call you virginia
but that would be a lie wouldnt it
what do you mean
isnt your true name
but it wasnt me so i started using virginia
is there anything wrong with that
its just the first and smallest in the tissue of lies that is the kleenex of your life
lets take one simple document as a sample of your veracity shall we carlotta
he grabs her purse from the desk rifles through it your drivers license
what color are your eyes
tru e blue
what if i asked you to remove your contact l enses
what color would they be then
and here it says youre a b l on de
off her silence cmon carlotta theres a very easy way for us to check
if you dont remember perhaps mr
more like a dirty brown isnt it
she nods lets see
weight one o five
off his look one twenty six
so on this single document you basically lied at every opportunity
im sure a woman as vain as you would also lie about her age
it says you were born in
whats the truth
how young did you try to make yourself
i didnt lie to make myself younger
i made myself older
i was born in
youre trying to tell us you lied to make yourself older
lied so i could get married
there mister i went to law school
reid does this have a point
oh you bet it does your honor
on a roll my client lied about her age because she was only when s he got married
which makes h er a minor
and in the great state of california no minor defeated to prenuptual agreements
knows he has you very little
this contract is void
the fact that my client gets nailed more often than a two by four is irrelevant
standard community property applies and this woman is entitled to half of the marital assets or thirty seven point three nine five million dollars
to dana yo
t a t t t
u r ostt
nothing further your honor
banging his q uie t
let me see the license and birth certificate
all is quiet while the judge reviews the documents
then in light of this new evidence the court must rule in favor o f the defense
cole is hereby awarded half of the marital assets or thirtyrseven million three hundred and ninety five thousand dollars
the courtroom erupts
cole are devastated
that son of bitch pulled it off
allan gives fletcher a thumbs up simultaneously miranda gives him the finger
o r d e r
now i understand both parties have agreed to joint custody
is that correct
im contesting custody
re her husband payback
for him trying to prevent me from collecting my thirty seven million
he was entitled to prevent you
you committed adultery
you only won because youre a liar remember
you pointed out that my husband took advantage of a poor underage girl
i was the vic tim here
and now im going to hit him where it hurts
but but you said he was a good father
do we have an agreement on custody or not
fletcher takes a distressed look at the children
in that case there will be a custody hearing tomorrow mor ning at nine
court is adj ourned
he bangs the gavel
everyone gets up but fletchers attention is drawn to a commotion between virginia and her kids
were leaving now
i want to go with daddy
fletcher watches horrified as she drags the kids away from their tearful father
ill see you no matter what
allan has made his way up to fletcher
re the i love kids
they give you so much leverage in a case like this
pats fletcher on congratulations partner
how does it feel
and with that question asked as he watches poor mr
cole and his kids the truth dawns on fletcher like a sledgehammer
just a second
to the judge y our honor
we re adjourned mr
she lies and she wins
what are we nuts
everyone stops watches fletcher
t his woman my client goes down with the frequency of a nuclear submarine and we just gave her thirty seven million dollars because shes a liar
and now as an extra added little bonus were going to let her steal the kids too
reid you are out of order
do you ever stop to ask yourself why do people hate us
could it be because what we did here today sucks
we dont care about the truth
we dont want to find the t r u th
we want to win
we want to win at all costs
and you know what the worst thing about wanting to win so badly i s
winning and finding out youre left with nothing
thats enough mr
reid let s see what i ve done today
ive helped a gold digging slut get richer
im taking this guys kids away
allan i dont like you in the least now im one of your partners
fletcher does feel strangely fantastic
free thats it mr
i find you in contempt
mussing hair ripping out kicking them pulling out commotion in the court
the judge bangs his gavel
reid from the courtroom
yo u wanna know the truth
oh yeah lets let it rain
the truth is is that ive traded my life
a beautiful wife an incredible son for this piss the bailiff grabs fletcher forces him out
the judge is turning beet fletcher is pushed passed mr
you just killed your career
i hope youre happy
a sad max is seated on the steps
two other boys are there with baseball equipment
were going home
yeah thanks for the great game max
emanuel knocks maxs hat off
audreys been watching from the door
she goes and sits by her son
your dad had a very big case today
it probably just i dont want to talk about it
i hate dad
i hate him
honey don t say that
max is really upset
its that look and then some
the look audrey never wanted to see again
she makes a decision
max theres something i want to talk to you about
fletchers handcuffed and is led to jail by two officers
theres a happy crazedness to him now
the truth is pouring forth but he looks way way off the deep end
desperately p as si ng a phone pho ne call

max and audrey at the table
the airline tickets jerry gave her are in front of them

fletcher is pacing back and forth
a group of tough prisoners are on the far side of the cell trying to stay as far away from fletcher as they can
and what about our water su pply
you dont think the mans dumped enough toxins to render every dick in this cell as lifeless as a beached minn ow
youre damn rightj the man does anything he w an ts
were nothing but pu ppets
little game pieces they move back and forth
a deputy appears
you made bail

a tow truck drives away with fletchers car leaving fletcher stranded
fletcher frantically tries to hail a
he spots digs through the yellow pages
finds ten minute taxi
he fishes for change
he doesnt have any
he spots a man walking by
scuse me sir

its the same beggar fletcher was rude to outside the courthouse
he continues walking
could you spare some
the beggar continues on
alright i get your point
but this is a crisis
look ill give you ten bucks
the beggar pulls out a quarter and holds it up
its so shiny and new
tw ent y
minted in denver

a moment as the beggar thinks then its worth twice that to screw you
he walks off grinning
fletcher turns spots a familiar building in the distance
m y office
he starts in the front door when a security guard stops him
whoa where do you think youre going
i just need to use the phone to call a cab
i work here

allan has just exited the elevator
to security son that man is tresspassing
the guard starts toward fletcher threateningly
allan ive got ten years worth of dirt on you and this firm and im in the kind of mood today to get a lot off my chest
you let me use the phone or i start talking
fletchers is thrown on his ass in the street
allan has watched from atop the stairs of the building
still euphoric reid
he goes back inside
fletcher starts to get up when a car screeches to a halt inches away
its karaoke time
fletcher runs up and hugs the astonished man fletcher kisses him on the lips
philips driving fletcher
youre saving my life philip
you know its funny but for some reason i was beginning to think you didnt like me
isnt that silly
its not silly
i dont like you
i dont like you
i find you boring
i hate ch ara des
and you wouldnt know a good time if it sat on your face
feels bad im sorry
it was easier than telling you how i really felt
are you upset
a moment then no
to be honest i dont like you either
you treat people like obstacles and you cheat at charades
then why are you always trying to socialize with me
youre a client
i figured if i didnt try to be your friend youd get a new accountant
philip i dont like you as a person but im crazy about you as my accountant
i d never hire a new accountant
so we dont have to like each other anymore
not at all
sooner i get you to the airport sooner i can dump your sorry ass off
philips car skids to a stop
fletcher jumps out
fletcher races in
fog rain something anything
he sees the departure board f li g ht
fletcher looks at the clock its
fletcher pushes his way he a crowded escalator
past people standing on the left despite the sign that says excuse me
come on folks lets let the frantic man pass
standing on the right passing on the left
they cant make this deal any easier than it is
at the top a woman in a nurses uniform asks for money
help the poor
speeding past i dont trust you
i dont know what the hell that uniform is
a hare krishna tries to stop fortunately theres no line at the metal detector
fletcher races right by but sets off the alarm
please step through again
fletcher frantically tosses his keys cufflinks his rolex into a tray
he tries again
it buzzes again
itii practically naked
a guy in a turban passes over him with a detector wand
its called a zipper hodgy
the wand beeps over fletchers front pocket
he reaches in and pulls out the now familiar blue pen
fletcher races by gate gets to
but sees the plane slowly taxiing away
fletcher spots a door marked not an exit
goes for it when a flight attendant interrupts
can i help you
the woman raises her eyebrows and looks anyway
and fletcher bolts through the exit
he scurries down a flight of stairs calling after the plane which is moving away
no way hell catch it
then he sees a mechanic working on a mobile stairs unit these are the steps they pull up to planes fletcher gets an insane idea
the worker hears an engine start looks up to see fletcher in the truck driving off towing the stairs
but fletchers gone
fletchers driving the stairs trying to catch up with the plane
ground workers react
soon the stairs are racing alongside the plane
fletcher looks for signs of audrey and max but hes too low to see in the plane
he grabs the tool boxon the passengers seat puts it on the accelerator pinning it to the floor
then he climbs the stairs sway back and forth as he reaches the top
passengers calmly read while outside fletcher speeds along waving his arms like a maniac
the engine noise drowns out his call for
a stewardess stands in the aisle giving the safety lecture
in case of a water landing please use your seat cushion her mouth drops as she notices fletcher
fletcher is banging on the windows
people on the plane point stare in amazement
fletcher looks ahead sees the stairs about to crash into the wing
fletcher desperately fiddles with some controls
at the last second finds the one that lowers the stairs
he surfs under the wing
and raises up the stairs at the other side
fletchers at the front of the plane where he finally spots
max has the window seat audrey arid jerry are next to him
audrey has on her headset and jerry is looking for his seatbelt
neither sees fletcher
fletcher screams to get their attention
but its too then fletcher looks ahead and his eyes go wide
the runway is ending
just then max looks up
sees his dad
audrey is now trying to help jerry find his seat belt
checks under his its right here honey
just a second max
mom its dad
what about dad
then she sees fletcher waving weakly
but the stairs dont
they keeps going straight heading right for the end of the runway and a parked loaded luggage and bam
fletcher the stairs the luggage all go flying
audrey strains to watch as fletcher lands hard onto a with all the strength he has he lifts his head sees hes in one piece and then collapses in defeat
fletchers banged up pretty good
his head is bandaged
puts a cold compress to his bruised forehead and winces
mumbles to oh boy the truth hurts
someone made bail for you
fletcher comes out limping totally dishevelled missing a shoe and still holding the compress
is that you
he looks up and is surprised to see audrey and jerry waiting for him just outside the door
max is sitting at the bottom of the stairs still angry
he sees his dad then quickly turns away
to audrey and jerry trying to seem chipper sorry i made you miss your flight not really
no response youre obviously a little upset not that i blame you
although ill bet youll still get the bonus miles
fletcher are you crazy
what were you doing
thats two questions
a yes but i think the legal term is temporarily insane
and b i was trying to finally have that talk with you about boston
audreys patience are growing thin
the whole truth and nothing but the truth with difficulty i tried to stop the plane because it was taking off with my life
you and max
this comes as a surprise to audrey
not just what fletcher said but the way he said it
i know youve met somebody
somebody pretty great
and the truth is i wish you didnt but you did and
all i m asking i s
please dont move to boston
please dont take max away
shes definitely moved by fletcher but not convinced
you can come visit anytime
its only a four hour flight
i dont want to visit him
thats what ive been doing visiting him dropping by stopping in
i want to be in his life
i dont want to be some jerk that sees him at easter
i want to be his father
fletcher turns to jerry
i know i have no right to ask but can i talk you out of taki ng that job
i can get you a better job here in l
ive got all kinds of connect ions
what do you do again
i design security systems
you know pac tec
one of their systems shorted out and burned down a supermarket
i got them off
another proud day for justice
if i ask them theyll beat your boston offer in two s ec on ds
dont put jerry in the middle
to fletcher boston means this snaps his to me
all i want is for this lady and max to be happy
preferably with me
whatever they want ill go along with
they both look to audrey
all i want is for max to be happy
audrey looks over to max seated at the bottom of the stairs
hes still upset
you better know your jury
youre hot exactly maxs hero today
just let me present my case
fletcher walks over tries to be playful starts walking i have been sent from the future to destroy you
no response a you mad at me
fletchers at a loss for how to begin
then you wanted me to stop lying
but lying isnt the problem
why we lie thats the problem
sometimes we lie to make someone else feel better
but sometimes we lie because the truth gets in our way
touches him but being an adult means you sacrifice some things for more important things
much more important things
i was so stupid max
pointing to his own head malfunction in vector one
all this time youve been here and i could see you anytime i felt like it
please dont go to boston
max i love you more than anything else in the world and you know its true
i couldnt say it if it werent true
a moment as max studies his father then to audrey hes telling the truth mom
hes not allowed to lie
i made a wish and anything dad says has to be the truth
but fletchers looking at his watch
max you made the wish at
ive been able to lie for the last seven minutes
max steps away from fletcher
so then you were
it wasnt a lie
i just wanted to be honest with you and tell you there was no wish to guarantee it anymore
you just have to believe me
max looks at audrey who is letting max decide for himself max looks at fletcher and tries to decide
to audrey mommy
do we have to go to boston
audrey looks at jerry then back at max
we dont have to
fletcher hugs his son the kind of hug that says ill never let you go
to fletcher can we play catch tomorrow
a beautiful park with a basball diamond
fletcher is seated on a bench waiting
hes dressed in sweats with a baseball glove
soon jerry audrey and max pull up
ma x i mu m
fletcher picks max up
fletcher and max do the transformer routine again
malfunction in vector seven
i have lost control of my affection reflex
fletcher starts kissing max on the head over and over
he sees audrey
youre gonna lose a limb come on dad lets play catch
starts to toss here you go mom
max screams oh you mean with a ball
he puts max down
max runs into position
fletcher stops for a second and turns to jerry man to man
i take back every dirty dishonest thing i ever said about you wrote about you faxed about you e mailed about you
fletcher tosses the baseball up and down
so you up for a little friendly competition
no you go play with your son
i wasnt talking about basesball
a slow smile from jerry
fletcher winks and tosses the ball to max
to max alright its time to show you the old fletcher reid change up
fletcher winds up in an exagerated super fast motion then instantly shifts to super slow motion
max cracks up
jerry cant help but smile too
there may be better things in life
but at this moment its hard to think of a single one
