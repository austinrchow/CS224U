antz unknown draft over a dark screen all my life ive lived and worked in the big city
we see the camera swoops towards the entrance then dives inside past a couple of tough looking soldier ants who stand at the gates of the ant colony like insect
into an access tunnel that snakes this way and that past a row of ants plodding along
and into the main chamber of the colony a huge teeming vista that seems to stretch away forever filled with ants rushing here and there on their business
we see a traffic cop directing foot traffic waving his arms like crazy so both sides move at once a column of soldier ants marching along in formation a chain
of ants letting down matchbox elevator filled with workers
which is kind of a problem since ive always felt uncomfortably in crowds
we join z a worker ant with issues
hes lying on a couch recounting his woes
ive got abandonment issues
my father flew away when i was just a larva
my mother didnt have much time for me
when you have five million siblings its difficult to get attention
pause i feel physically inadequate ive never been able to lift more than ten times my own weight
sometimes i think im just not cut out to be a worker
but i dont have any other options
i was assigned to trade school when i was just a grub the whole system just
makes me feel
insignificant enthusiastic terrific
you should feel insignificant
for the first time we see the ant motivational counsellor
hes a mixture of tony robbins and ron popiel the hyperactive late night tv huckster and founder of ronco
hopping around enthusiastically yes
you know people ask me doctor why are you always happy
and i tell them its mind over matter
i dont mind that i dont matter do you get it
do you get it
z gives a fake smile
incredibly up z were part of the fastest growing species in the whole world the counsellor rolls down a chart from the wall
an arrow shows ant population going up up up
ask me why were so successful
why are we so successful
im glad you asked me that question
the motivational counsellor opens some blinds
and we see a vista of the ant filled chamber below
what do you see out there
millions of creatures each with his assigned task all pulling together
down below we see a group of ants carrying a boulder up an incline
one worker ants slips and the boulder rolls down crushing his leg
the other ants rush over it looks like theyre going to help their fallen comrade but instead they climb right over him and pick up the boulder continuing with their
being an ant is being able to say hey im meaningless youre meaningless
but but ive always felt life was about finding meaning
and then sharing it with someone special someone you love
the motivational counsellor puts his arm on zs shoulder
he seems to understand
you need help
looking at a clock whoops
were gonna have to stop there
your minute is up
the counsellor ushers z out of his seat and towards the door
now back to work
weve made real progress remember lets be best superorganism we can be
gigantic tunnel with the size and scale of the chunnel
a banner strung overhead reads the mega tunnel tunneling our way to a bright future
along the walls hang s work incentive style posters with messages like you asked for it you got it more work
and two meals a week is enough
line after line of ants is working on the tunnel digging passing clumps of dirt from ant to ant everyone synchronized
close on a clump of dirt being passed from hand to hand
azteca a feisty cynical female worker ant who stands there waiting to pass the dirt on
z is daydreaming behind her with clumps of dirt starting to pile up in front of him
earth to z
you better snap out of it or theres gonna be a lot of pissed off ants
z looks back and sees the ants behind staring at him angrily
snapping out of it sorry azteca
here you go fellas
looking at the dirt shouldnt we be wearing gloves
i mean this dirt is very
doesnt anyone think of hygiene
zs stomach growls boy am i hungry
im so hungry im seeing double
it looks like theres two million ants in here
tomorrow or the day after
sweetly z old pal
shouts shut up
its bad enough theres a food shortage without you complaining about it every day
the squeaky wheel gets the oil
the squeaky wheel gets thrown away alright
youre a good ant z even though you are a pain in my rear segment
i dont wanna see anything happen to you
so quit mouthing off before you get in trouble
all the ants put down their tools
then the whistle blows again
all the ants pick up their tools again
resigned breaks over
getting back to work this colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground
why are we even digging this thing
who cares z
all i know is we gotta dig
were not the ones in charge
the huge spacious main chamber of the colony
looming over the scene is the royal palace which seems to be inaccessible perched on top of a hill like pedestal
around the base of the pedestal a crew of workers loiters seemingly aimlessly
can these be the only unemployed ants in the place
the workers look up and groan
then they start forming a stairway with their own bodies linking arms stepping on each others shoulders
its extremely unpleasant work
one ant is a little tardy and just manages to get in place before
general formica the pattonesque military leader of the colony steps on his head using it as the first step as he ascends to the palace his aide de camp carpenter
as formica mounts the stairs we can hear the workers going ouch
cut the chit chat down there
turning to carpenter weve spoiled these workers carpenter
theyve never had it so good and listen to them always grumbling and complaining
formica steps on the foot of one of the stairway ants who muffles a yelp
what have they got to complain about
three square meals a day
actually sir weve cut them down to three roughly rectangular meals a week
dont give me statistics carpenter
i know what im talking about
formica and carpenter have reached the top of the staircase
there the two guard ants on either side of the massive throne room doors pull them open and one door hinge to guard ant while passing oil that soldier
the queen is on her throne her huge abdomen sprawled behind her
formica salutes and marches to her carpenter behind him
note throughout this scene the queen is giving birth repeatedly
each birth is accompanied by a herald playing a short happy birthday fanfare on his trumpet
mid wife ants bring each baby to the queen for inspection who coos a few words
the midwives put the babies on a moving bassinet line powered by ants on a treadmill
general the severe food shortage that faces the colony
the thought of any of my children going hungry
she shudders then to baby whos the cutest widdle worker
dont forget to brush your teeth
to mid wife ship er out
back to formica what steps are you taking to remedy the situation
we are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory
yes what else
please dont worry your majesty
leave the worrying to me
as you know im not an ant of half measures
i dont pussyfoot around
this crisis is my number one priority and i promise you its being dealt with swiftly and decisively
the queens attention is interrupted by another baby being put in her arms
to baby no snacking between meals
off you go
to formica now what were we saying
oliver north style i do not recollect your majesty
will that be all
yes general formica
carry on my good man
i dont know what we would do without you
formica clicks his heels and bows his head
carpenter bows low
formica smartly about faces general formica
princess bala hurries through a second doorway carrying a swatch book
something about her sets her apart from the handmaiden ants with her
her tiara probably
formica tilts his head quizzically to carpenter behind him
sotto princess bala sir
you look outstanding
is there anything i can do for you
well i thought since were getting married
it might be nice if we
got to know one another
formica looks confused
bala has always been a hopeless romantic general
its just that well im honored that you selected me and everything i just thought the marriage might go a little more smoothly if we had a conversation
to carpenter wasnt she briefed
holding up a baby look general
a darling baby soldier
emotionally to baby dont try to be a hero
just make sure you come back in one piece
handing it off next
using the interruption ill take your suggestion under advisement princess
in the meanwhile formica turns to go
general we have to talk sometime
carpenter is there a convenient time to talk vis a vis relationship
actually sir were ahead of schedule
we have thirty six seconds available right now
balas a little fazed
but grabs her chance
how was your day
what did you do
scouring his mind well
i declared war
and i was afraid we had nothing in common
under his breath fourteen fifty hours sir
he strides across the floor
bala watches him go her antennae drooping unhappily
we see through the now open doors into the throne room as formica and carpenter double time out of the frame
the queen sees that bala is unhappy
sympathetically i felt the same way before i got married
hopefully you did
yes but i did my duty and sorted out all those messy feelings
the wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged
youre lucky general formica is a paragon of anthood
the doors swing shut on them revealing the two guard ants who were crushed in the wake of formicas exit
bala enters followed by her handmaidens who are in a state of giggling infatuation over formica
bala is scowling as she leafs through a wedding catalogue
swooning over general formica the generals body segments are so
giggling id let him order me into battle anyday
bala hurls the swatch book against the wall
how could anything be wrong
im going to marry general formica and be a queen and have millions of babies just like my mom
concerned do i look fat to you
knowingly to handmaiden pre wedding jitters
you just need to blow off some steam
lets go to the bar at the royal club
the clubs so stuffy i want to try someplace different
there isnt anyplace else making a joke except the worker bar
the worker bar
thats where i want to go
the handmaidens look shocked
but we cant therell be workers there
a long bar filled with ants
the bar itself seems to stretch for miles and there are hundreds of ants trying to get a drink
unfortunately theres only one bartender
z is at the bar with weaver a burly ant soldier
we declared war again
off weavers nod are you scared
shrugs ill be back
the bartender a grizzled veteran slaps down what looks like a couple of large green beer mugs
actually theyre aphids little green critters he fills up from a number of kegs hanging from the ceiling
the kegs are specialized ants with hugely distended stomachs which spray liquid into the aphids
as theyre slapped on bar ouch
two aphid beers
as bartender leaves did you see that
how he gave you the beers not me
im telling you hes got something against workers
i dont know what youre talking about z
come on everybody dumps on us workers
you soldiers get all the glory
plus you get to go out into the world meet interesting insects and kill them
yeah but you get to spend all day with those fabulous worker babes
we can see that weaver is eyeing a nearby table of worker babes including zs friend azteca
weaver theyre career girls
theyre obsessed with digging
sighs no ill probably never meet the girl for me
who said there was a girl for you
i was talking about a girl for me
quaffing his aphid beer dont you want your aphid beer
i cant help it
i have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature
call me crazy
z weve known each other a long time right
you were born two seconds after me
and all the time ive known you youve been grumping and groaning
you should quit making waves
go with the flow
weaver im an insect not a liquid
down the bar theres a commotion
a grizzled old scout ant has had too much to drink
have you been to insectopia
have you no ya goddam larvas
becoming emotional mosquitos n caterpillars n beetles all livin in peace stuffin their guts with food
no rules no regulations
you can be your own ant there
howling drunkenly its insectopia
insectopia hey weaver listen
i was cut off from my unit found it by mistake slurring it changed my life
spraying another soldier with saliva you see ya follow the great yellow egg and you come to the land of red and white youve had enough for one night
come on gramps before you get in trouble
the soldiers pull him from the bar carrying him out
excited hey did you hear what he said
poor guys had one too many scouting missions
princess bala is peering in at the entrance to the ant bar accompanied by her worried looking handmaidens
we shouldnt be doing this it isnt proper
im the princess arent i
of course and do princesses do improper things
of course not then if i go to the worker bar it isnt improper
anyway dont worry
no one will recognize us in our disguises
she adjusts her disguise a hardhat tied down jackie o
style with an ants version of a chanel scarf
im just a common worker cooling off after a rough day
an ant barker takes the mic at one end of the dance floor
on loudspeaker okay folks
its six fifteen and that means its time to dance
every ant gets up to dance
weaver turns to z
draining his beer time to cut a rug z
im not in the mood
disgusted even when theyre off work they follow orders
well you just sit here and be a party pooper
weaver joins the rest of the ants who are lining up for the dance
the barker calls out the steps in a bored monotone all the ants already know the steps
everyone dances in perfect synch
southern twang and a left right quarterstep back step halfstep a left right quarterstep backstep halfstep a left right quarterstep backstep halfstep at the entrance bala smiles mischievously at her
im going to ask one of these mindless primitive worker types to dance with me
but general formica would be furious
enjoying the idea i know
the handmaidens are appalled
bala whirls away from them sets her sights and searches the crowd zeroing in on z whos watching the other ants dance
what a bunch of losers
mindless zombies capitulating to an oppressive system wanna dance
balas standing right there
z is instantly smitten me
yes i mean regaining suavosity just let me finish my beer
not breaking eye contact with bala z smiles suavely
reaches suavely for a beer
suavely grabs the candle in a glass jar off the bar
suavely singes his face
he plays it off with a rakish little laugh
a bit apprehensive bala heads onto the floor
z follows her
so uh how come i havent seen you around here before
covering up i work in the palace i dont get out much
the palace hunh
i bet those royals really live it up
of course theyre all a little you know from inbreeding shocked what z and bala step onto the dance floor with the rest of the ants but z cant do
any of the steps
now lets see i its been a while since i i think you bala watches z trying to follow along
its the blind leading the blind as z tries in vain to follow the barkers rapid instructions
here ill lead
z starts doing his own individual dance
with a suave expression on his face he leads bala in a helter skelter mixture of tango charleston and hand jive
are you sure this is a real dance
well actually uh im sort of making it up surprised really
why should everyone dance the same way
its as exciting as watching fungus grow
surprised you you think im right
why cant i just do whatever i want to do
why cant i just go wild
bala starts to get into it making up her own steps in reply to zs loosening up having fun
for a moment the two of them are actually sexy together
then they get a little too wild and the other ants who are still doing their intricate dance start to collide with bala and z
z almost knocks over a big soldier ant
we can only see the ants back at the moment
watch your step worker z has turned around to see the soldier ant major mandible glaring at him
mandible is about twice zs size
hes got one eye missing and half of his left antenna his been chewed off
you watch yours soldier or my worker friend will beat you up
terrified oh thats okay ill let him off this time
whispering to bala are you crazy
this guys built like a pebble
ineptly trying to placate the soldier you know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays arent you gonna stand up for yourself
zs caught between a rock and a hard place
he doesnt want to get beaten up but on the other hand he doesnt want to lose face in front of bala
more soldiers have gathered around looking hostile
how come you dont dance like the rest of us
z glances over at bala
then shaking with nervousness he says defiantly
because because im an individual an individual
never heard of it
you look like a worker to me
hey lay off my little buddy
z meanwhile looks far away ecstatic as if hes just realized something very important
unfortunately just at this moment a soldier pushes weaver
weaver pushes him back
somebody makes a dive for z and before you know it theres a regular bar brawl going on with weaver in the middle of it cracking heads together punching ants
in the face having a great time
just then the princess handmaidens hurries over
z whos scrabbling around on the floor overhears
youre a princess the police are coming uh oh
to z goodbye
when can i see you again
let me think
bala rushes off with her handmaiden just before a squad of whistle blowing police wade into the crowd
but shes already gone leaving z holding her scarf
z is talking to weaver whos getting ready to go off to war
nearby columns of ant soldiers march by
get real z
she just dropped the scarf by accident
are you kidding
there were sparks between us
this scarf is a sign
its a sign that youre crazy
do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is
whats gonna go wrong
i take your place for the royal inspection
bala comes strolling down the line she sees me bingo love is rekindled and she takes me up to the palace for a little
wags his eyebrows suggestively tea and crumpets
and you take your place again and go march around to your hearts content
weaver looks unconvinced
you have to help me
think of all the things ive done for you
thinks i cant think of any
pause well im gonna start doing things for you
will you introduce me to some worker girls
theyll really go for a sensitive guy like you
maybe ill get lucky
weaver thinks about it you know z i wouldnt do this for anyone but you
weaver hands z has helmet
overjoyed youre a real buddy
sourly yeah i know
what do i do
dont tell anyone youre a worker
follow that column over there
and come right back after the inspection
weaver points to a bunch of soldiers hurrying by in formation
i owe you
z skips off and joins the column marching in time with the soldiers but too excited to keep from jazzing it up a little
the ant army has gathered in a huge hall in front of a reviewing stand
we can hear the murmuring of thousands of soldiers but all we can see is a huge poster of an ant general pointing right at the camera
the poster reads general formica wants you to obey
z turns to some of the soldiers near him
any of you guys know when the princess will show up
shes kind of a personal friend
the soldiers look at z like hes nuts
martial music sounds and we hear thousands of ant feet as they snap to attention
z imitates the soldiers awkwardly
general formica struts to the middle f the screen slapping his thigh with a swagger stick the antenna of some unfortunate insect first of all let me make one thing
nobody ever won a battle by thinking for himself all this thinking stuff is a load of crap if the almighty had wanted you boys to think he wouldnt have
given you huge mandibles and a brain so small youd misplace it if it wasnt trapped inside your head in the audience z starts laughing he thinks formicas just made a joke
slapping his thigh trapped inside your head thats a good one z notices nobody else is laughing
geez tough room
from the stage formica is squinting at the audience trying to make out who was laughing but there are just too many ants
striding back and forth we ants survive as a species because we do what were told
we survive because we work together as one we get the job done we do whatever it takes to persevere
dramatic pause hell were not an army of ants
were one giant ant with giant fists and giant jaws the soldiers cheer
z cheers along with the rest of them
to the soldier ant next to him lays it on a little thick doesnt he
if you ask me hes one giant bore
now ive heard a lot of scuttlebutt about a food shortage well you boys are gonna be taken care of
but in the meantime were gonna eat the enemy for breakfast we are gonna eat the enemy for lunch and we are gonna eat the enemy for dinner geez and
i forgot my toothbrush
reflective moment dammit im proud to be an ant
he looks out at his army and i know each and every one of you boys will do your duty
z applauds and whistles as the other ants look at him in confusion
bring on the princess
stow the gab there soldier
lets move em out
the soldiers turn to the right and start to march out past the reviewing stand
a colonel marches at the head of zs column as z looks around for the princess
left finally as zs part of the army marches past the end of the reviewing stand he sees her looking bored standing next to the queen who is giving the
ive got your scarf
on the reviewing stand bala sees z that is to say she sees one of the thousands upon thousands of ants marching by
peering out who is that idiot
darling you must encourage the troops wave
bala waves unenthusiastically little more than flopping her hand back and forth on her wrist
down below z takes this as a sign that bala has seen him
excited excuse me guys thats my date
well its been fun
have a great war
z tries to squeeze his way back towards the royals but hes surrounded by a solid wall of soldiers and theyre carrying him along with them
z loses sight of the princess as hes carried away
barbatus a hard as nails grunt soldier ant taps z on the shoulder
you new kid
i just joined up
but im quitting
i got a trial membership
kid when you join this ants army youre in for the full hitch
at that moment z is swept out of the cramped corridor theyve been marching along as the army emerges into the open air outside of the colony
its a starry moonlit night
the shadows crowd around the panicked z who looks up at the sky as we see the army on the march
wait a minute theres been a mistake
ive got to get back to the colony
z starts to fall out of line but barbatus looking concerned stops him
are you crazy kid
they shoot deserters
z swallows hard
you just stick by old barbatus
hell watch out for you
off zs look whatsamatter kid
leave a girl behind
shes kind of playing hard to get
as a matter of fact shes playing completely unattainable
nervously so whats on the schedule
a brisk walk
a foraging expedition
no were going to attack the termites
but i hate attacking
its so hostile
around z and barbatus the ants start up a marching song which we intersperse with dialogue between barbatus and z to form a montage time cut as the ant army
marches on to the termite capital
to the tune of when johnny comes marching home we ants go marching one by one hurrah hurrah
we slaughter termites just for fun hurrah
so these termites theyre little shy retiring insects
grim smile no such luck
those dirty terms are five times bigger than us and they shoot acid from their foreheads
we ants go marching two by two hurrah
well all be dead before were through hurrah
montage shots of an ant column marching diagonally across the screen fading into another column marching diagonally downwards across the screen
well what exactly does our platoon do
our platoon has the best assignment of all
were the first into battle
we ants are marching three by three hurrah
dead ants is what we soon will be hurrah
montage shot of zs column crossing a bridge composed of living ants all of whom look extremely uncomfortable as theyre getting stepped on
so were going back for more armor right
i mean these guys are from outer space how are we supposed to beat them
superior numbers kid
z looks up to see
looming high above them
the termite city which is built in the stump of a dead tree
from here it looks like a demonic mount fuji
the colonel ant shouts an order
the front line of ants starts rushing towards the termite colony
z is swept along
over the tooooooooooooo op
z is swept along and up the side of the stump as thousands of ants invade the colony through every possible entrance
over the lip of the stump
and down inside to the very middle of the termite colony
into a disquietingly peaceful scene
theyre in the middle of the hollowed out trunk and ants keep pouring in but theres not a termite to be seen
barbatus looks around suspiciously
its too damn quiet
then we hear a strange tapping noise
barbatus looks over and sees that zs teeth are chattering with fear
dont be scared kid
barbatuss got yer back
petrified maybe they went out for the evening
lets leave them a message and head home
ignoring him light it up a nearby soldier ant take a firefly out of his knapsack and pinches him the firefly yelling yipe
shoots into the air like a flare lighting up the interior of the stump with eery shifting luminescence
then we notice hollowed into the inside of the stump like innumerable pockmarks termite holes staring out upon the stump
and with an unearthly we see the first of hundreds of termites emerging to pour into the center of the tree right onto the ant army
to z keep your head down
within moments z finds himself in the middle of a the ants have broken into the colony but are taking heavy losses from the gigantic blind acid spewing termites
the battle scene is as sprawling and chaotic as something out of braveheart in a few quick shots from zs perspective we see a squad of ants rushes towards a
termite soldier but are literally melted into smoking heaps of flesh by a jet of acid from its forehead
a termite warrior is overwhelmed by a crowd of ants and is pulled to pieces with hideous ripping sounds
another termite warrior takes on an ant soldier one on one and slowly crushes his head in his huge jaws
looking around guys
it isnt too late for all of us to just talk this over
just then a termite burst up from the ground and turns to face z
z is dwarfed by this hulking roaring drooling monstrosity
acid makes me come out in spots
could i just say i have always had the greatest respect for your species
i mean eating wood why didnt think of that
the termite rears getting ready to melt z when oof
hes knocked backwards by
you you saved my life
dont get all sappy about it
as barbatus and some other soldiers kill the termite the colonel strides up to z puffing on a cigar
i love the smell of formic acid in the morning
a stream of termite acid engulfs the colonel instantly burning him to a cinder clutching a still burning cigar zs paratroop buddies turn in terror to see a herd of
termites rumbling towards them
z terrified dives into the hole that the huge termite made
and tumbles headlong into a corridor of the termite mound
the corridors here are primitive caveman like pocked with jagged access holes
no sooner has z landed in the tunnel than a termite comes burrowing out from one of the side walls snapping at zs head
z just avoids getting decapitated and digs straight through the wall in order to escape
straight into the hub of the entire termite complex the queens chamber
this is nothing like the civilized court of the ant colony its a huge stinking fetid dungeon whose walls are held up by one massive to z column of piled
the termite queen a repulsive slimy squirming foot long monster is attended by a crew of diminutive blind termite nurses
the queen turns to look z right in the eye
i seem to be lost and i was wondering if you could give me before z can say directions the queen gives out a piercing blood curdling shriek the nurses
start shrieking too
backing away ill let myself out
but the queens shriek has summoned a soldier termite the biggest one weve seen yet who is charging headlong at z jaws snapping open and shut like huge scissors
backing away shoo
at the last moment z jumps out of the way and the termite runs headfirst into the supporting column of the chamber
as if on a spring release the termites jaws clamp shut and shatter the base of the column
the walls of the room begin to rumble
the termite turns to eat z
but is crushed by a stone falling from the ceiling which gives a final shudder and collapses raining earth and stones down on the queen
as the walls of the chamber crumble melees of ants and termites pour into the room from the corridors around and above
they keep struggling until
points at z hes killed their queen
hey im sorry it was a mistake we can see that the termite warriors deprived of their leader are suddenly confused and directionless easy prey for the ants
facetious this is terrific
lets exact crippling war reparations
lets set up a puppet government
lets slaughter them all
the ants set about killing the disoriented termites when
we hear another rumble coming from the outside
the ants look up confusedly
and a from the ants point of view five hundred foot long tongue bursts through the top of the chamber with a crash
the ten or so ants standing directly below are smashed by the tongue which squirts out a spray of saliva around the crater
as quick as it appeared the tongue retracts with a hideous sluuurping sound
we can now see the end of the snout of an ant eater poking through a hole in the ceiling high above
the tongue comes down again smashing some more ants whose bodies are slurped up by the tongue
the ants scatter but to no avail as the tongue comes smashing down again and again
z heads into a side corridor as the tongue smashes down again barely missing him
z retreats along the corridor as the tongue searches for him across the tunnel from intersecting access tunnels getting closer and closer to z dragging more and more screaming ants
and struggling termites
then the tongue disappears
z wipes his brow
and we hear a thunderous sniffing noise as the anteater searches for more prey
and the tongue starts rumbling down the corridor right towards z the tip squirming as it ricochets along the walls
z gets up and runs the tongue lapping towards him reminiscent of the stone sphere that nearly crushed indiana jones in raiders of the lost ark the walls disintegrate under
the pressure of the tongue which gets closer to z
and just misses him as z tumbles out of the stump and down to the ground
z sits there dazed as we see the huge form of the anteater withdraw its tongue and with a final contented burp shuffle off into the distance
z makes his way across the corpse strewn battlefield an expression of horror on his face
z looks down at his feet where barbatuss still living decapitated head is looking up at him
be honest kid am i hurt bad
no no youre
youve got good color in your cheeks
no i can see it in your eyes
im a goner
its alright z
in this ants army a soldiers life aint worth a sack of fungus
he winces i cant feel my legs
hang in there buddy
you can make it
just take deep breaths ill try and find your body its gotta be around here somewhere
gasping i wonder
was it all
barbatus hang on barbatus
dont make my mistake kid
be a grunt
your whole life
barbatus dies leaving z heartbroken
weaver is passing as a worker working alongside much smaller worker ants
he actually loves the work
hes throwing up dirt like a bulldozer
hes so enthusiastic he scoops up a whole ant in his shovel and tosses him aside
azteca whos standing next to him in line is shocked by and a little attracted to this turbo worker
hey slow it down big boy
youre making the rest of us look bad
how come i havent seen you around here before
covering im new
i was born yesterday
tell me about it
nobody told me digging was so much fun
you pick up the dirt you move it you pick it up again you move it again lots of repetitions you exercise the forceps and the pincers ogling him mmm
yes i see what you mean
while azteca is checking out the hunky new worker work has effectively stopped
clods are piling up behind weaver
a foreman comes striding down the line furious
whats the holdup here
weaver whips his shovel up to his shoulder and salutes as if hes dealing with a superior officer
sorry sir i was just having a little chat with my friend yelling at weaver who said you could have a chat youre not a chatter youre a digger
so shut up and dig
leave him alone
well just for that you lose your days rations
now get back to work
the foreman heads down the line shoving and berating the other workers as he goes along
surprised at herself i dont know what came over me talking back like that
i must be going crazy
sorry i got you in trouble
but listen you can share my rations
flirting are you asking me out to dinner
blushing no i mean yes i mean if you dont have other plans
ill make myself available
listen better watch out with the backtalk
i dont know want you to end up like the guy who used to work next to me
im afraid he got
downsized some guard ants are looking out across the sandy main entrance to the hive
the armys back
alert the colony
the other ant starts ringing a bell rushing down into the colony
a huge crowd is forming eager to welcome the army back
a band is striking up a triumphant victory song confetti and streamers are being thrown as general formica strides in followed by carpenter
the armys returned
our brave boys are back
everyone waves little flags as the tuba player oompah oompah oompahs
and z walks into the hall looking bedraggled and exhausted his helmet hanging over his ears
the band slows to a halt
at the edge of the crowd azteca sitting on weavers shoulders can just about see over the crowd
it looks like only one soldier made it back
weaver looks distraught
to himself poor z i should never have let you go
far down the hall z is describing the battle
it was horrible
a massacre a massacre upon a massacre
first we massacred them then they massacred us then it was halftime
ive never seen such violence such bloodthirstiness such bad manners
im the only one that made it
the atmosphere is somber
this is a tough one to try and put a spin on
but that doesnt stop formica from trying
the band strikes up again and everyone cheers
no you you dont understand
damn im proud of you boy
i wish i had a hundred ants of your caliber
the world would tremble
now time for some r and r
youre invited to the royal victory party
royal victory party
will princess bala be there
the entire royal family will be there to honor you
thinks renewed cheers as z is lifted onto the shoulder of some of the soldiers who stayed behind
wait a minute thats no soldier thats z
the little guy made it
z is following formica away from the cheering crowd
z and formica are going up the royal stairway together
son youre an ant after my own heart
an ant that looks death right in the face and laughs well i generally just make belittling comments and snicker behind deaths back
so tell me fellow war monger
do you think princess bala likes men in uniform
well she better shes engaged to one
as in youre getting married
you two are in love
shakes his head im just a plain old soldier at heart
ill tell you what i love the field blood death orders
and the company of other warriors
formica gives z a manly slap on the back
z looks a little uncomfortable as we
z follows formica and carpenter into the throne room
at the end of the hall a society band is playing
the room is full of courtier ants and officers
waiters are gliding around holding trays of hors douevres
wow what a spread you know theres a food shortage in the rest of the colony
yes and do you know why theres a food shortage
not enough food
too many ants and while we soldiers go out there and fight and bleed and die for the colony the namby pamby workers live it up back home
feeling a little hot z wipes his brow
well i i dont think living it up is the right term how about working themselves to death
i tell you son sometimes at night i see myself in battle fighting a horrible faceless enemy with the future of our whole species at stake
and always the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the others heart
spooked oh hey thats great i think i see an old war buddy over there its been fun chatting
good luck with the hallucinations
z escapes from formica who gazes after him suspiciously
z mingles in with the crowd then he sees princess bala standing with a group of officers who are eating hors doeuvres
telling a joke what do you call it when workers are killed in a tunnel cave in
a beat who cares
the officers laugh but bala looks bored in this stuffy social scene
dont you think the worker class is the very foundation of the colony realizes hes getting odd looks i mean uh without them who would we stand on
youre the hero of the recent termite campaign arent you
well if single handedly vanquishing the enemy and slaughtering a whole nestful of termites makes someone a hero yes i am
z reaches for a tray of canapes that a waiter is carrying by and knocks the whole thing clattering to the ground
feigning nonchalance and you are
im princess bala
affected well charmed im sure
so princess have you ever danced with a hero
oh well then one more wont matter
she moves towards the dance floor
z spit combs his antennae struts after her until he trips on his sword
he tumbles falls but hops to his feet just as bala turns toward him turning it into a ballet plies
just warming up
theres something familiar about this guy
but then they start dancing
across the room the queen and general formica watch the party
all these parties are so marvellously alike they should be
suspicious but theres something funny about that soldier
formica strides over to where z and bala are dancing
glowering may i cut in
intimidated oh of course pulling z back no general
im dancing with the war hero
trying to placate formica uh sorry general i
ive always had this animal magnetism it bala yanks z back onto the dance floor dancing away from formica
you remind me of someone
formica catches balas eye
she frowns at him and decides to get a little shocking
he was swarthy
as she says these things z tries to act accordingly
he was a worker
i danced with him at a workers bar just the other day
im not shocking you am i
as a matter of fact
a filthy stupid disgusting worker
the dancing stops cold
gee uh could you say it a little louder i think there are some ants in the next colony who didnt hear you
offended thats not what you said the other night now shes panicked quiet sshhh
digging it in at the worker bar you were pretty hot to trot then
a livid formica is stalking over towards them
furious whats this
a worker has been masquerading as a war hero
well it wasnt a masquerade really it was more what id call a clever ruse cant we all settle this like adults were not larvae anymore angry officers begin to
surround z who hides behind bala in fear using her as a shield
oh my god
hes taking her hostage
no im not i mean nobody move
or the princess gets it
people shout and scream as z backs up with the princess
into the kitchen
z backs up into the kitchen still pulling bala along with him
here ant chefs are preparing food for the party vomiting little florets onto a platter
formica and the soldiers follow them in
to formica stay back you lunatic do you think i dont know how to use this
z realizes that hes pointing his finger at them uh oh
the officers rush for
and z with bala in tow falls backwards into an opening marked garbage
hold on the garbage chute exit
nothing happens for a moment
then from a distance we hear the faint sound of screaming dopplering closer and then z and bala come flying out of the exit right into the mud cutting off
the scream abruptly
bala sits up coated in mud
z is nowhere to be seen
because shes on top of him
this is thoroughly unacceptable
youre telling me
she gets up and runs back towards the colony entrance where soldiers are already issuing to get her
just as balaa about to be rescued
what looks like a gigantic laser beam sweeps along the rim of the colony sizzling the ground as it moves along
and ignites the lead soldier into flames
bala looks stunned
z watches in horror as another soldier ant is fried and we look up to see a gigantic magnifying glass casting the beam
we can just about make out the huge grotesque figure a seven year old kid holding it
bala who has no idea whats really going on turns from the colony and runs the other way
im going unfortunately this draws the fire of the laser which follows after her in what looks like a strafing run sizzling in her footsteps
z whos running towards the princess suddenly realizes that hes running towards certain doom
and joins bala in legging it away from the colony under a brown leaf which bursts into flames between the redwood like stalks of some flowers
and finally into the relative safety of some grass
where they throw themselves on the ground exhausted
z and bala dust themselves off
what was that thing
how should i know i order you to find out where we are
alright alright ill try to get directions from one of the locals
z tries to flag down some passing bees
excuse me i it passes him by he tries the next pardon me same response and they call them social insects
climb up that tree and get a better view
bala points to a thin blade of grass
gingerly z tests the grass and starts climbing up it
but his weight bends it so that hes lowered back to the ground face to upside down face with bala
ive been kidnapped by the village idiot
whos the bigger idiot the idiot who gets kidnapped or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot
how dare you speak to me like that
im the princess
z squares up with her
but is the monarchical hierarchy applicable without the underlying social structure to support it
it defines society
to deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself
but can there be a society composed of just two ants
theres no such thing as just two ants
you never see just two ants you see a million ants
look around sweetheart
she looks around
she doesnt like what she sees
she glowers at z
well i guess that makes us even
dont make me laugh
youre crazy about me
thats why you lied and cheated to get near me
oh come on youre the one who came after me the swarthy earthy sensual worker
repulsed i was slumming it i danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place
is that the same standard you used to choose general formica
didnt choose him
what kind of idiot would
unconvincingly choose who she wanted to marry
she shakes herself out of it
now worker you shall take me back to the colony and have your head cut off and stuck on a sharp pole
well thats an appealing offer but
considering the options
he decides you go back
me im going to insectopia
insectopia you stupid worker thats just a fairy tale
yeah well i have it on a reliable source
he knows that was maybe stretching it that it exists
now you follow the yellow egg
looking around that direction
come back here now
ive got a name its thats not a name
thats just a letter
z meanwhile hits the road
bala has no idea of where to go
just then the scariness of the outside world comes through to her
we start hearing noises the equivalent of scary jungle sounds in a tarzan movie the hissing croaking chirruping
bala sees eyes looking out at her from all directions
and spots a colossal monster a sparrow fixing her with his beady gaze
clears her throat worker
louder now oh worker
where are you
getting desperate z
wait for me
bala heads off after z
the mass of worker ants are swinging pick axes in the tunnel
the foreman moves up the line berating the workers yelling at them to dig faster
i tell ya im gettin sick of bein yelled at
what do you want were just workers
you know youre not just workers you can be whatever you want to be
look at z
he started as a worker then he became a soldier
he slaughtered hundreds of termites single handedly
i heard about this guy
turning to the other workers he crashed a party at the palace
then he took a hike with one of the royal babes
and when they tried to stop him he just looked at a couplea guards and they burst into flames
youre nuts how could a worker do all that
well because hes more than a worker
what did he call it azteca
no an individual whats that well its
someone with his own point of view
someone who does what he wants not whatever hes told to do
eyes lit up watching weaver someone who follows his heart
taking aztecas hand right
because every ants important
scoffs but that would mean im important
im outta here this sounds like trouble to me
but more ants are gathering round
we can all be individuals
just like weaver and azteca hold hands
more ants are gathering around dropping their tools
a glimmering desert landscape think of the suns anvil in lawrence of arabia
two small figures can be seen tiny dots moving across the arid whiteness
theyre bala and z who are crossing a concrete path in the park which they perceive to be a desert
water oh you already said that
walking along my skins dry my exoskeleton is cracking
i wish id never met you you ruined my life
ruined your life
look i was perfectly happy until i met you alright i was miserable but i was happily miserable over zs line we can see a gigantic wheel getting larger and
larger and heading right towards them a gigantic wheel the front wheel of a bicycle which is heading right towards them
bala pushes z out of the way just as the wheel rolls past with a cacophonous crunching grinding noise like a gigantic millwheel
were going to die
come on its gone
what are the chances of that happening again
no sooner has he said it than the rear wheel of the bike thunders past
well ill be
bala notices that theyre clutching one another in fear she pushes him away
why didnt i listen to my mother whyd i have to go looking for trouble
any ant would have given their left legs to be in my position
whats wrong with me
want a list
urgent wait i hear something
we can in fact hear a low musical plunk
theres a pause and then we can hear it again
z and bala walk over a rocky dune the soft shoulder of the path
beyond the grass starts up again
they have come to the end of the desert i
the other side of the path through the blades of grass we can see
a lake a puddle stretches before them
it is in fact the overflow of a drinking fountain whose drain is jammed
as z and bala run to the lake water dribbles from the fountain and into one edge of the pool to the ants its a waterfall
bala and z run to the edge of the water and start slurping
they smile at each other until they remember that they dont like each other
this lake is huge
and so close to the colony
think of the vacation potential
cut me down a soft leaf so i can take a nap
listen princess you cant order me around
out here youre not the boss anymore out here youre just but before he can finish a water droplet from the fountain falls on him
it may not sound like much but to z its as though a ten foot diameter sphere of jello had engulfed him
zs stuck inside because of the surface tension of the droplet which doesnt burst just quivers up and down
inside z is slowly frantically drowning and screaming for help
but his screams are muffled in the water
annoyed out here im just what
through the water hlllllllp
hands on hips stop fooling around in there
by now the droplet has started rolling and z is being turned upside down
he manages to get one foreleg out of the droplet and in a frantic attempt to pull himself out pulls bala in by the leg let me go
but its too late theyre now both stuck in the droplet and as z continues to drown he also has to deal with bala yelling at him though we cant
hear exactly what it
is shes yelling through the water
then having run out of air she too starts thrashing alternately trying to swim and trying to slap him as z tries to defend himself finally all this commotion is
enough to make the droplet burst spilling the two coughing sputtering drenched ants onto the ground
they both lie there miserable wet and cold
chants to herself im going to be rescued soon
im going to be rescued soon
im going to be rescued soon
z watches her incredulously
princess has it ever occurred to you that theyre not going to rescue you general formica wont let me die out here
im his fiancee
how many other princesses are there
five thousand three hundred and ninety no
about five thousand four hundred by now
and only you can become a queen
no but so what makes you so special
i am the oldest
bala turns from z
shes thinking things over realization dawning on her
by three seconds
she looks out into the grass forest
to herself youre right
there are as many princesses
as there are blades of grass
z overhearing her slowly puts his hand on her shoulder
formica and carpenter are walking into the entrance of the tunnel with a squad of soldiers
dammit this tunnel is priority a
we cant afford any delays on this project
ive never seen anything like it general theyre theyre
ahead of them a group of a few hundred workers have stopped work and are sitting down chanting
a worker moves forward to join the strikers tossing down his tool
yelling at him where do ya think youre going
get back to work
buzz off im important
joining the others at the center of the group weaver and azteca are holding hands leading the chant
notice the big one holding hands with the female
well uh who notices workers sir
calculating no one should have to
have him brought to me
a nervous weaver is sitting across from formica flanked by a couple of stoic guards
carpenter stands smiling by the side door
there is no obvious threat to weaver but the atmosphere is truly intimidating
so this z
he fancies himself an individual
i dont know really sir
patronizing well now you havent fallen for this silly idea of individuality have you
oh no sir
youre a good soldier
thank you sir
weaver begins to relax a bit
so tell me
i have no idea sir
he pats weaver on the shoulder
we know what makes an ant colony strong dont we
we know that no ant can be an individual
no single ant matters right
enthusiastically thats correct sir
points at a guard not that one
another guard or that one
formica nods at carpenter who smiles and opens a door
two soldiers walk in holding azteca the color drains from weavers face
calmly with satisfaction or that one
her life doesnt matter does it
dont tell that tightass anything weaver
weaver starts to get up but the guards behind him hold him down
just let her go
zs long gone anyway following some golden egg to insectopia
youll never catch him
formicas face lights up
see why individuality is so dangerous
it can always be used against you
to the guards if this sissy here wants to dig hell dig
send them both back to the tunnel project
double their workload
the guards exit with weaver and azteca
what do we have on this insectopia
scattered reports sir
desperate times call for desperate measures
get me ant team six
frightened ant team six
z and bala are lost wandering through the grass looking hopeless i swear weve passed this blade of grass three times
z keeps marching on
face it z were lost
we must have walked halfway across the world by now
how did i get into this mess
too shy to look at her come on
tell me there wasnt just a little
something between us that first night at the bar
the night we danced
sadly what difference does it make
were both going to starve to death or get squished or set on fire
but z is just gawking
the shot expands to show that they have stumbled onto
the land of red and white
a red and white picnic blanket which to the ants looks like a vast undulating pavilion stretches before them
they gaze up at two obelisks a salt and pepper shaker
behind that is a gigantic tupperware jar full of potato salad and sandwiches stacked high
it all looks perfect with the clean lines and monumental proportions of fascist architecture
in fact it looks a little too perfect
weve found it
insectopia look at all this food amazed you were right
you were right
smiling happily z its beautiful lets dig in
z goes over to a gigantic sandwich but booiiing
hes prevented from getting at it by the saran wrap covering it
theres theres some kind of force field
bala joins him laboring against the saran wrap
then both of them hear laughter from above
lockjawed accent muffy look party crashers
laughing theyre simply too much chip
bala and z look up to see two large yellow wasps hovering in the air above them
the husband and wife wasps have lockjawed william f
to z and bala you down there havent you ever been to a picnic hunh
habla ingles to male wasp well i really dont know who they are
the male wasp zooms in closer
poopsie we know some ants dont we
to z are you related to the fifth avenue ants
darling do you have to talk to any insect from off the street
just being friendly poopsie
im not just any insect
my mother is the queen
momentously im princess bala
under his breath theyre eurotrash dear
we hear a loud rumbling noise the family is about to sit down for their picnic lunch
gigantic hands reach down and pull away the force fields
to z a little piece of advice sport bob and weave
bob and weave
what do you mean
well like my father used to say theres no such thing as a free meal
the wasps dive in to the picnic darting in for a bite and then dashing away again
excuse me ill have some potato salad thank you dont mind if i do
but all is not well
we pull back to reveal that z and bala are standing in front of a giant sneaker logo which is attached to a giant sneaker which moves i sort of
imagined insectopia a little differently just at that moment we hear a whistling in the air and the female wasp is crushed by a huge swatter that sweeps out of the sky sending the picnic blanket billowing up in an aftershock that throws bala and z to the ground
shaking her muffy
but she doesnt move
the male wasp stares up at the sky
heartbroken but z also looking up has no time to commiserate
bala look out
they are only saved by the fact that they are so small
the holes of the swatter pass over them
the woman realizing that the swatter wont work on ants throws it to the side and tries stomping on them
before bala can get away a sneaker falls on her with a thunderous boom that shakes the ground
the shoe rises as the person wearing it steps away
and we see that bala is stuck in one of the ridges of the waffle soled sneaker adhering to a big piece of bubblegum z
but bala is carried off on the sneaker in a huge looping ferris wheel like motion
the sneaker on which bala is stuck falls again as the woman tries to step on z too bala
mournfully ill never see her again
but he does instantly as the shoe rises again showing bala stuck deeper in the bubblegum z
get me out of heeeeere
the woman has decided to walk away from the picnic to get the bubblegum off her shoe
z heart sinks as the shoe balas stuck on lopes off into the distance
thinks these things always come in twos
he sees a second shoe starting to rise take me to your leader
z runs towards the shoe as it rises
and at the last moment catches on to the snaky swinging shoe lace whoooooooaaaa
the sneaker lifts off into the air with z holding on for dear life to the lace and getting further and further away from bala as hes drawn to a
the landscape can be seen rolling and pitching crazily in the background
come back here
for a moment the sneaker seems to pause in the air
then it descends again in a stomach churning roller coaster free fall as the sneaker on which bala is stuck rises up again
but z is trying to keep his lunch down as he descends
the sneaker hits the ground and z can feel himself again
its now or never
tarzan whoop aa ee ya ee yaaaaaaaah
as the sneaker rises again he swings off the lace hurtling through the air and catching one of the laces of balas sneaker
the momentum swings him up and under the sole
z gets smashed into the bubblegum next to bala
now hes stuck too
the sneaker descends again
z and bala hold hands and scream as they see the ground rise too meet them
theyre squished deeper into the bubblegum
the sneaker rises again
if we dont make it
i just want you to know
this is all your fault the sneaker rises and seems ready to fall again
but instead it just hovers there
the person wearing it is balancing on one leg and about to scrape off the bubblegum with a penny
just then the hand holding the penny looms up
the penny is by ant standards about sixty feet high
the huge image of abraham lincoln stares down at them
who the hell is that the penny starts scrapes the bubblegum off the sneaker bringing bala and z along with it
theyre carried through the air as the penny gets thrown away
turning over and over in a lopsided orbit as bala and z scream
and land with a crash in total darkness the lake where z and bala were nearly drowned by the water droplet
the earth shakes as a huge monstrous creature approaches the lake and begins to drink from it
the creature seems to hear something and growling turns its ugly head
its a pomeranian one of those yappy little lap dogs but seen from ant perspective its something out of a horror movie ant team six take him out the monster
bears its huge fangs at the approaching intruders a bunch of flying ants who look as though theyre attacking the death star the monster rears and snaps at two of the ants who are making a diversionary run
and then gets it from the rest of the ants who land on his soft wet nose and start stinging away like crazy the monster rears back in pain and
runs away yipping
the members of ant team six a crack team of hardcore flying ant commandoes a la seal team six break off the attack and land
and dont come back you sissy major mandible ant team sixs lethal commander steps into frame
hes the one eyed killer we met in the bar earlier
the rest of his team fan out to search the area
talk to me
z and the princess were here sir
signs of a struggle
lets get a read on that feremone track
to the others get the sniffer two other commandoes come running up with what looks like a piece of machinery on a tripod only its an ant a highly specialized
blind ant with an incredibly acute sense of smell
the tracker drool running out of its long proboscis sniffs the air and starts signalling like a geiger counter
as hes swivelled nnononononononoyeahyeahnononononono no
finally the tracker stops swivelling pointing in one direction and saying yeahyeahyeahyeah
ten clicks from here
z you dirt digging fancy dancing wisecracking royalty grabbing rebel yelling into the distance mandibles muscles bulge
the veins in his head throb
this is one ass kicking ant
even mandibles troops look scared of him
ant team six takes to the air heading in the direction indicated by the tracker ant
out of it we hear the voices of z and bala
come on z
you go ahead i give up
i dont know what i was thinking
in one corner of the screen we can see an irregular little hole through which a shaft of light is falling
bala proceeds towards it the hole appears to get bigger and bigger
defeated theres only one thing worse than an ant who goes around mindlessly following orders and thats an ant whos too dumb to go around mindlessly following orders
she notices that theyre being watched
shes emerging from a tied off garbage bag the yellow ties loop away gracefully
bala and z have been tossed into a garbage area
and above them and below them peering from garbage cans recycling containers bags etc
a multi cultural assortment of insects are regarding them
a laid back fly voices their thoughts
whats with the bummer attitude
a nearby butterfly joins in
yeah nobody stresses out in insectopia did you say
joining bala insectopia
z and bala look around
just to get things straight the garbage dump doesnt look disgusting that would be seeing it through human eyes
instead were looking at it through ant eyes and reimagined this way its paradise not the ordered sterile paradise of the picnic but an earthly land of plenty
the sides of the plastic garbage bags are sheer reflective walls of smoothest obsidian
the garbage cans are gigantic thick metal columns put there by the gods think the pyramids a coke bottle refracting the sunlight into a gorgeous rainbow trickles a fountain of
sweet nectar into the pink bittersweet flesh of a grapefruit half which appears as a multi chambered concave dome
everywhere insects are disporting themselves a multi species love in thats like an insect version of woodstock
bala and z are awe struck
bala turns to z
happily z we made it
alighting on the grapefruit cmon in
the nectars fine
like a kid at an amusement park z slides down the smooth side of the garbage bag whooshing this way and that until he slides into one end of a
straw a red and white striped tunnel and is shot out yippeeeeee
into a bottle cap filled with lemonade which he alternately drinks and swims through
down at the bottlecap z is drying himself off
then he sees emerging from behind a lemon peel a gigantic termite
terrified surprisingly the termite seems equally terrified
to z hey take it easy
theres nothin to be afraid of
yeah well i make it a practice not to trust anyone who shoots acid out of their forehead
dude here in insectopia we dont judge people by how many arms and legs weve got
yeah back home they called me a fruitfly
but here im known as
with attitude superfly
anyway big gus is mellow
the termite sticks his hand out
a drop of acid drips from his head and splashes at zs feet
taking his hand disgusted charmed
z reaches out and shakes the termites hand as bala watches smiling
the insects are having a cookout their faces illuminated by the still red ember of a match platters heaped with food lie untouched as they pat their bellies
z and bala sit next to one another smiling shyly as if they had just met for the first time
you never did tell me
what made you come out to the worker bar that night
just looking for fun adventure trouble i guess
well trouble is my middle name
actually my middle name is
but i dont tell people
hey bala i
i actually have something of yours
you left it at the bar that night
z takes out balas scarf which hes been keeping folded in a pocket
sorry its been through a war not to mention everything else
you held onto this all that time
i know its a little strange but
i thought it might come in handy if i
needed a scarf someday
embarrassed well to be honest i just liked having it
he hands it back to her
bala looks at z frankly openly
for a moment z is shy
then he looks at her too
theyre two lovers leaning closer about to have their first kiss when hey the moment is wrecked
z looks up
a chubby beetle stands there with gus the termite
wanna bring back dessert
theres a thirty foot long blimp in the next can made completely of chocolate
i wasnt busy or anything
z gets up to go with them
great timing guys
ever wonder why they call you pests
as ant team six lands and takes up position above the feast
the tracker ant is going nuts
yesyesyesyesyes one of the commandoes puts his hand over the trackers mouth to shut him up
mandible communicates with his troops by pulling down his one functional antenna and gruffly whispering into it as though it were one of those commando headsets
his troops do likewise
talk to me
ive got a read on the princess but target z isnt accounted for
lets move in
back at the feast a cricket strums on his legs like a guitar opining about life and the universe to a bunch of other chilled out hippyesque insects
bala taps her feet to the song
what if like
were just these tiny little things and were just like part of this whole other huge universe thats like so big we dont even know it exists
thats so deep
at that moment ant team six rapels down from the top of the garbage bin landing amongst the insects
the cricket gets up to confront mandible but mandible cold cocks him with a right to the jaw
the other insects too surprised to fight just do as theyre told
alright you hippy scum
make one move and ill exterminate you
a couple of commandoes grab bala by the arms and heave her up
you dont understand
i dont have to understand missy ive got orders now wheres z z the termite the beetle and the fly are happily carrying a huge m m back to the
man your girl is fly know what im saying
overdoing it oh bala
i guess shes okay you know for a princess
i mean i usually date queens or you know empresses because sometimes the lesser nobility are too much in awe of my smouldering sensuality
please stop me if im making you feel inadequate
they throw down the m m which lands with a thud
z notices that the rest of the insects look spooked
whats the matter
this place is as cheery as a roach motel at check out time
z looks around
balas been kidnapped
some flying ants took her back to the colony
shes been kidnapped
but i cant live without her
z just stands there heartbroken
determined im going back
ive got to get her
wholl come with me
z looks around
nothing but sheepish looks and shuffling from the insects of insectopia
z looks disheartened
hes about to leave when ill go
the male wasp is hovering nearby
i know what its like to lose someone
i keep hearing the sound of muffys flapping wings
so ill take you
z hops on the wasps back
lets go pal
the wasp takes off leaving the other insects looking a little chastized
i feel like a real stinkbug
the wasp and z fly high above the colony
i never saw things this way
from here we can see the whole layout of the land around the colony
the desert an asphalt path and across it the lake the overflowing water fountain things look so close together from up here
theres the desert
and the lake
thinking about something its not far from the colony at all
suddenly the wasp bounces up and down in the air
formica sits at his desk going over some plans
formicas chambers are located inside a snake skull with the eye sockets serving as windows and the mouth serving as a door
the walls are hung with trophies the heads of other insects
ant team six burst in the doors of formicas office carrying the struggling and kicking bala
one of the commandoes sets the tracker ant one the floor
then formica gets up from his desk as the commandoes bring the princess to him
with urgency wheres z
bala replies warily
covering for z you dont have to look for him anymore
he was eaten by a praying mantis
regretfully its a shame he died prematurely
i was hoping to kill him myself
well youll never be able to hurt him where he is now
sadly i miss him already
surprised you miss him
why angry because
because hes twice the ant that you are
i could never go through with marrying you
im im an individual and when i get married itll be to someone choose
the soldiers look shocked
for a moment formica looks furious
then he just shrugs
shaking his head princess bala im just a simple old soldier and the ways of the feminine mind are a little too complex for me
but one thing i do know is there are more princesses where you came from
i just hope theyre not all like you
in the meantime maybe we can arrange for you to see z again after all
he gestures to the commandoes who drag her out the door
we notice that the tracker ant has been left behind
z hops down from the wasp who has landed near the entrance to the colony
good luck z
for a wingless insect youre alright by me
they shake hands and the wasp flies off
to himself how am i going to get in
the place is crawling with soldiers
z starts for the nearest entrance but hes spotted by a couple of soldier ants
zs caught its over
he turns around with his hands up
what are you doing out here
all workers are to remain inside the colony by orders of general formica
z cant believe his luck and his curiosity is piqued
heading inside well
if you insist
the queen with formica striding at her side is carried by a personal escort of fifty or so struggling workers to the bottom end of the mega tunnel where a
red ribbon waits to be cut
very impressive general
behind her hundreds of thousands of workers are crowded looking confused and expectant
some of them clutch little flags and noisemakers
wave that flag you maggot
which we see are being handed out to them by ant team six
is there anything wrong your majesty
the queen is looking around unhappily
how i miss bala
i wish she were here for this special moment
formica warmly places his hand on the queens shoulder
falsely supportive she is your majesty
she is the camera heads up the long long tunnel where we see
bala tied and gagged
shes at the point in the megatunnel where it begins to curve upwards towards the surface
she struggles against her bonds but cant get loose
elsewhere in the colony a column of soldiers marches by and we hear the tromp tromp tromp of their boots
when theyve gone z pokes his head out from behind a pile of dirt
he heads in the opposite direction of the soldiers
z creeps around the outside of formicas chambers
this part of the colony seems to be deserted
geez this place really empties out in august
where is everybody
z walks up to the skull that houses formicas chambers and peeks in the eye socket
inside the tracker ant whos been left behind switches on eyes glowing
z enters the chamber cautiously
i smell z
for a moment zs afraid
then he sees the small tracker ant doesnt seem hostile
you smell me
well look i ive been out in the wilderness for a while and the tracker ant keeps sniffing
z waves his hand in front of the blind ants eyes
getting it hey wait youre
youre one of those pheremone sniffers arent you
maybe you can help me
im looking for a friend of mine princess bala
z picks up the tracker ant
just remember i met her first
z carrying the little tracker ant heads out following its lead
through this and that passage as the tracker ant gets more and more insistent
and finally straight to a blank wall yeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeah
balas through there
this is why i left in the first place
z can answer his own question
he puts down the tracker ant with a look on his face like a kid forced to eat broccoli starts digging through the wall
meanwhile a member of ant team six the stupidest member in fact waits at the very top of the tunnel where it narrows almost to a point
hes hanging from a winch and has a little hammer and chisel in his hand
hes whistling awaiting instructions
z emerges from the tunnel hes dug spits a load of dirt out of his mouth and wipes his hands off
nearby bala lies there bound and gagged
z unties bala and undoes her gag
you came back
why do they have you tied up here
theres something going on z from here z can see far down the tunnel to where the crowd is gathering
theyre having a ceremony to open the megatunnel
we can hear the sound of water shifting somewhere above
he looks up the tunnel
in the distance we can make out the silhouete of the commando set to break open the wall
bala that that lake we found i think the tunnels right underneath it
horrified formicas going to flood the colony thats what he meant when said there were too many ants
bala looks too shocked to move
z starts pushing her into the tunnel he made and starts heading down towards the crowd
what are you doing
i know its crazy but i cant just leave
dont argue with me
if ive learned anything its that the problems of two people dont add up to a hill of ants in this world
something like that
anyway ive got to warn the others z looks into balas eyes
head for the surface bala
if i dont make it well
well always have insectopia
then he starts running down the tunnel towards the crowd
following him z
wait for me
all the soldiers are filtering out of the assembly area leaving the workers behind
as his troops march by formica steps to the side and hands the queen a pair of scissors to cut the ribbon strung across the megatunnel
your majesty im afraid matters of state keep me from attending the ceremony
but general this tunnel is your baby
youre sure you cant stay
fraid not your majesty
with regret goodbye your majesty
very well general i know you all work and no play
alright lets move out
formica surrounded by his bodyguards hurries off as the queen readies to cut the ribbon
in the name of the colony i declare this tunnel open
z and bala sprint towards the bottom end of the tunnel
and then pull back to see queen cut the ribbon she looks up and sees bala
z calls out to the crowd
weve all got to get out of here
this place is going to flood
the workers are unconvinced
are you nuts youve got to believe me
what makes you so special mr
know it all
the workers are even more sceptical
a laugh goes up from the crowd
gimme a break
zs ten milimeters tall
and he can kill termites with his bare hands
youre just some scrawny worker with a mental problem
am no youre not
yes he is weaver steps out of the crowd
weaver runs up to z and hugs him starting to cry
it is z
listen to what he says
im so sorry
i dont worry about it pal
nearby bala and the queen hug
the queen looks over at z
its that social climbing worker again what does he want
in response to save you all
now weve got to go
outside of the colony where formica surrounded by the army gives a signal to mandible by drawing his finger across his throat
talking into his antenna let er rip
at the top of the tunnel the commando starts chiseling away furiously at the wall
and nothing but dust falls down
the commando looks at the dust as it falls down down the long tunnel
he looks up at the dry wall
and a torrent starts pouring out swallowing the terrified commando as if he were a crumb and heading down the tunnel like a freight train ripping up the walls as
everyone turns to hear the rumbling sound coming down the tunnel listen
from here we can see deep into the tunnel at the point where it levels out
and the torrent can be seen rushing down at them
all of a sudden theres panic as every ant tries to scramble away from the oncoming water
in the confusion the queens bearers drop her and scramble over her
the queen turns and for a brief moment is silhouetted against the white capped torrent of water
and then she picks her abdomen up like a skirt and high tails it away from the torrent running so fast that she passes some of her bearers on the
and then the torrent spits out of the mouth of the megatunnel quickly filling up the chamber and branching into all of its side tunnels as we see a group
of workers running up a side tunnel and getting consumed by a wave which crashes down on them like a hand slapping a table
another group the members of which are getting swallowed up one by one one of the ants runs up on the ceiling of the tunnel and keeps on going upside
it works for a while but eventually he too is swallowed up
in the nursery nurses are evacuating stacks of crying ant babies
in one of the larger access tunnels down which thousands of workers are fleeing a group of ants turns and decides to make a stand for it they link up
in a mass and form a living dam
it holds for a while but then bursts scattering and smashing ants along the sides of the tunnel before eating them up
the huge main chamber of the colony where most of the workers as well as z bala weaver azteca and the queen have run to
the chamber is rapidly flooding from all sides
water flows out of every escape tunnel the workers try
and the crowd is becoming more and more closely packed together as the waters rise around them
theres no way out
were all going to drown
what can we do
z clenches his fist
he feels utterly powerless
then he shouts
dig the workers turn to look at him questioningly
weve got to dig a trench around us
but one of the workers raises his hands
we dont dig any more
were too important to dig
you taught us that z
you hate digging
at his wits end yeah but i hate drowning more
now dig you heard the ant dig
the workers start to dig a circular moat around themselves passing the dirt back into the middle of what remains of the dry ground
but they seems to be making little headway against the water as it continues to rush in
the ant labor we saw up to now were nothing compared to this
as the moat gets deeper the pile grows higher and higher
weaver is digging up huge chunks of earth
nearby azteca is digging like crazy too
z runs around directing traffic and encouraging the workers
pass the dirt back to the center
nearby the queen stands there looking squeamish
time to get your hands dirty
gingerly the queen reaches out for a clod of dirt
and passes it along
next thing you know shes practically crushed by a huge load thrown up by weaver
the water keeps rushing in
but now we notice that
the pile of dirt in the middle of the island created by the digging of the moat is growing higher and higher reaching up towards the ceiling of the chamber
and the water is getting swallowed up by the moat swirling around angrily
now z looks up and sees that with a little more effort they can reach the top we need to form a scaffolding around this mound lets do it
the workers start to cluster around the mound covering it forming a tight network of living bodies around the mound up towards the ceiling
now climb the ants start to scale the scaffolding up towards the top of the chamber
its a swarming mass of ants hauling each other up giving each other legs up climbing ever and ever higher towards the top
where they start to dig through the very ceiling
as at the bottom of the mound z starts to organize the hauling away of the queen as though she were a big cargo container
okay boys take her up
z slaps the queen on the butt and shes winched away on a cable composed entirely of ants linked arm in arm like those plastic toy monkeys
and aztecas head pokes through the ground
she hauls herself up and hundreds of ants pour up from the ground widening the hole
the water is rising
but almost all of the ants have escaped
z clambers up the mound as the scaffolding of ants rolls up from the bottom
and the rushing water finally wears down the earthen core of the structure
as z hauls himself through the hole in the ceiling
the entire structure collapses into the angry waters below which seem furious to have missed their prey
he did it
the z cheer goes up with everyone joining in
but the jubilation is short lived for appearing on the ridge surrounding the workers is formicas army circling the mass of workers backing them in towards the roiling water behind
formica himself appears in the front lines with carpenter and mandible at his side
i should have known
all that work all that preparation come to nothing
all because of one stinking ant
he steps forward to address the surrounded trapped workers
the workers trembling but silent cower inside the unbroken circle of soldiers
formica laughs shaking his head
folks you may have survived that flood but theres no way youre gonna escape from me ill make you a deal
hand over the rebel leader z and you survive
this sends a ripple of murmurs through the workers
but if you dont hand him over youre all going to die each and every single
individual one of you
the workers all look at each other
what shall it be workers
the workers remain frightened but silent
z trembles terrified
have it your way
as formica raises his swagger stick to order the attack a lone figure steps out from the crowd
z stands there shivering with fear
for a moment z stands alone under the glare of formicas gaze
then another figure steps out from the throng of workers
no im z turns astonished to see weaver still and unwavering bravely risking his life for his friend
then azteca also steps forward
im next bala comes forward
no im more and more ants step forward
im z and so is my brother
ive been z for weeks now
regally we are z
now the workers are all shouting the same declaration
i am z
i am z
i am z
z is plainly flabbergasted
formica is outraged
he gives the signal
the army swells forward on all sides pushing the workers towards the swirling water
some workers surround the queen to protect her
all seems lost when the fly from insectopia alights on the rim of the horizon
the wasp appears on the other side of the horizon
suddenly on all sides a massive insect army appears on the ridge looking not unlike ambushing indians in a john ford film
formicas soldiers stop in their tracks awed by the unfolding spectacle
it looks like all of insectopia has turned out spiders caterpillars rhinoceros beetles all manner of creatures crawling and flying have shown up and now surround the army dwarfing them
are these hooligans giving you trouble z
say the word z and we kick their butts
the ant army remains frozen unsure of what to do next
formica is furious
if ants had veins formicas would be bulging out of his face
what are you doing
berating his army come on you yellow bellies
turning on carpenter dont just stand there carpenter
make an example of yourself
uh actually we are outnumbered sir
formica turns towards the insects gathered against him
with his chin raised pridefully formica steps forward and formica runs so quickly and with such force that his helmet blows off his head
zs eyes get big he stumbles backwards slipping and formica goes flying over him toward the whirlpool behind
he scrabbles at the edge of the water and then tumbles over
for a moment it looks as if hes gone
z goes to the edge of the precipice and looks over
formica is struggling in the waters of the very flood he created which are roiling not far below
he looks up into zs eyes a new expression crossing his features fear
i cant swim
formica goes under for a bit then his head comes up again but hes not going to be able to stay afloat for long
suddenly he sees a line dropped down
above z looks down on him
i thought you said that the life of one ant doesnt matter
formica looks at the line
and in that moment seems to realize his error
i guess it does
to the ant
formica reaches up and takes the line and is pulled up by z and a bunch of other ants the line we see extends from a nearby spider one of
the cavalry from insectopia
formica is left broken and alone by the precipice while hordes of ants surround z to congratulate him
bala fights her way to his side and the two of them embrace
then the ants pick up z and bala and cheering bear them away
only carpenter stays behind
he walks up to formica carrying his dented and dusty helmet
he cleans it the best he can with his jacket sleeve and hands it to his fallen general
sir if its any consolation i still think youre completely worthless as an individual
as he addresses the audience stand up style
so uh thats pretty much it
just your basic simple worker overthrows the government and winds up with the princess kind of a story
you know there was the big parade and everything
a huge assembly of ants applauds as z who is given a medal by the queen
general formicas face looking extremely dispeptic
general formica was almost unemployable
he eventually got a gig as a honeydew keg
pull back to reveal formica clinging to a wall his belly hideously distended with honeydew
the queen asked me to take over his job but i said sorry but im really not the general type
im more the specific type
so they gave the job to weaver instead
weaver in formicas old office in a generals uniform his feet up on formicas desk smoking a cigar
carpenter is on his hands and knees scrubbing the floor
weaver cut the defense budget in half
now we only have an army of five million
cut back to and me i guess you could say that i lived happily ever after
bala enters the frame embraces and kisses him
i mean ive got the whole package right
a great life a beautiful wife and a few kids
few z and bala stand in the midst of their living room up to their knees in thousands of child ants
the children cover every horizontal surface
they run around cry laugh and tease each other
z looks around the room looks back at us and shrugs
well so nothings perfect
but you know
i wouldnt change a thing
the camera pulls up
and away from the ground
to reveal that this whole story has been taking place in a small area of central park
we pull back and back and see all the familiar landmarks from the story the bike path the drinking fountain etc
