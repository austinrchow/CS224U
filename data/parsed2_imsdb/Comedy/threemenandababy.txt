three men and a baby written by coline serreau and james orr and november
on a chartered plane flying from miami to newark airport
jack is the captain
his copilot paul is seated beside him
in the passenger cabin a female gymnastics team is celebrating a hard won glorious victory over the miami team
they are singing dancing in the aisles and drinking champagne
in the rear of the cabin there are three regular pass engers a teenager his mother and a man who appears to be a businessman
the plane is flying over the coastline
the partition between the cockpit and the passenger cabin is open
jack is very excited
he cant stop turning around to look at the passengers
to paul oh my god

jack gets up and paul takes his place at the controls
jack makes his way up the aisle through the girls who are blocking the way to the object of his affections
she is sitting in one of the aisle seats and singing her head off
jack leans over and whispers quickly and intensely to her
im the captain of this plane
may i ask your name
sure my name is jane
listen jane ive seen many beautiful women in my life but i swear to you ive never ever met a woman as exquisite as you are
jack kneels down before her and the girl looks at him amused
he takes her hand and places it over his heart

he hands her his business card

i love you jane and if you call me ill be the happiest man in the entire universe this is love at first sight
out of all these beautiful women i noticed only you and
the girl laughs as jack goes on
meanwhile the busi nessman who was seated in the rear of the plane has gotten up and walked over to jack

but youre the pilot arent you

the businessman goes back to his seat and jack grabs hold of the microphone
this is your captain speaking
in honor of your victory in honor of your beauty and in honor of jane the most beautiful gymnast i have ever met
im going to give you a little demonstration of aviation gymnastics reserved only for the most important guest hip hip
everyone shouts hooray
except for paul and the
businessman who remain grim
jack dips the plane very low over the water and skims the cliffs along the coast
it is a beautiful impressive stunt
there are gleeful shouts in the cabin among the passengers
jack is saying an emotional goodbye to jane as she leaves with her teammates
jane finds it all very funny but jack looks totally wretched seeing her go
jack and paul walk toward the exit
god what a woman
paul is nervous glancing uneasily from car to car
wanna share a cab
paul yeah sure
a black ford pulls up in front of them and its driver looks at paul who immediately turns his back on him
shes so beautiful
ive never been so in love before
can you believe she gave me her phone number
oh christ where is it
oh no dont tell me i lost it
its a matter of life and death
oh here it is thank god
all the while jack has been rambling on a beige car on the other side of the street has slowed down
paul notices it
in the beige car a narcotics agent graton is behind the wheel with one of his colleagues sitting beside him
theyre slowing down
take a picture
the colleague snaps a picture of everyone who happens to be standing near the black ford including jack and paul
the black ford pulls out
the beige car follows it
paul observes all this out of the corner of his eye
listen i need a favor i got
a little problem
hey look will you look at that sparkling beauty
a very beautiful woman is coming down the walkway with cart overflowing with luggage
one of them falls off
i mean its like
theres this little package
shell never make it with all that luggage shes got
i gotta give her a hand
look at the colors in her hair
christ ive never seen a woman like her before
hes about to walk off when paul grabs him by the arm
jack listen can i
sure you can no problem
listen i gotta go now im gonna see if shell share a cab with me
you take the shuttle okay
but i gotta explain to you about

jack races toward the woman and begins to help her with the fallen luggage
we see him talking to her and we can hear a little of what hes saying
as exquisite as you are
i think im gonna faint
he kneels takes her hand and puts it over his heart
the young woman is flabbergasted
a lonely looking paul hails the shuttle bus
a large stylishly decorated apartment in manhattan
a tremendous living room
a partys going on
very loud jazz is playing
the lights are dim
there are about guests
lots of young pretty women
people are sitting on couches talking others are eating drinking or dancing
in a dimly lit corner jack is kneeling before a girl sitting in an armchair
she is laughing as she listens to him
whispering passionately this is no line and im not trying to get you into bed
this is something completely different
this is love at first sight
oh im so happy
let me go get you a glass of champagne
ill be right back
jack gets up and goes over to the buffet
as soon as hes out of the girls line of sight he starts running toward the other end of the apartment
on the way he passes michael whos deeply engrossed in a vehement conversation about modern art with a girl called sophia
theyre fighting like cats and dogs but seem to be enjoy ing it
are you saying thats art are you really saying thats art
well then you explain why
it goes back to prehistoric man
they had comic strips on their walls for gods sake
whispering in michaels ear im having a hard time
im working on two at once
very interested oh yeah who
the brunette in the armchair in the living room her names rosalie
and the other one
clementine shes waiting for me in the den
he moves away towards the den
to sophia wait one second for me ill be right back
michael walks off in the direction of rosalie
paul is wandering among the guests trying to find jack he sees peter who is talking with another young woman nicole
peter is nodding idly looking around com pletely uninterested in the conversation
you guys have a beautiful place here
but the rent must be a killer
peter isnt paying attention
isnt it a killer
oh the rent
yeah its high but split between the three of us it isnt that bad as long as we dont eat
hi peter im looking for jack have you seen him
oh hi paul how are you doing
yeah sure ill take you to jack
to nicole excuse me for a minute
they move away
youre a lifesaver ive been trying to get away from that woman
that sonofabitch carl is moving in on my natalie
wait what about jack
in a hurry hes around somewhere
check under all the couches
paul walks off in jacks direction
we stay with peter who reaches natalie
she is talking with a very styl ishly dressed tall young man carl
oh natalie ive been looking for you all night
i just saw you deep in conversation with nicole
hell no we were just talking shop
oh come on peter we all know what a ladies man you are

smiling broadly at carl no its top secret but hes been telling me about it
in a bad mood ours is incredible too
if you ever get it finished
paul comes up to jack who is kneeling before clementine whispering passionate sweet nothings in her ear
it appears hes gotten beyond the this is love at first sight stage
hes getting down to the nitty gritty now
clementine is thrilled
paul taps jack on the shoulder
jack can i talk to you for a second
oh hi paul yeah sure

ill bring us back some champagne
he disappears with paul
youre a lifesaver paul
i thought id never get away
rosalies waiting for me in the living room
isnt she terrific
oh yeah for sure i dunno
listen can you do me a favor
with some difficulty paul follows jack as he picks his way through the people dancing heading in rosalies direction
what kind of favor
damn ive got to get her a glass of champagne
listen ive got a little problem
im having a valuable package delivered to me on sunday but im not going to be home
ive got to do the hawaii tahiti australia route so can i have the package delivered here instead

okay sure not to anyone at all
look im sorry paul but i gotta get back to rosalie

jack finally reaches the armchair where rosalie is sitting
he stops short obviously disappointed
michael is sitting next to rosalie right next to her
they get up to dance
as he passes jack michael smiles broadly
alls fair old buddy
jack watches a moment then breaks into a wide smile
singing oh my darling oh my darling oh my darling clementine
jack whirls around and heads back towards clementine
the guests are leaving
commotion in the hall people are saying goodbye to peter and michael
natalie is about to walk out
natalie why dont you stay for a nightcap
no ive gotta get up early
to natalie do you care to share a cab
oh yes thanks thats really nice of you
smiling triumphantly to peter good night peter
with a forced smile good night carl
ill call you sunday natalie
she has already left
the door closes on the last of the departing guests
so you struck out again with natalie huh
that carl is a real smooth operator
hes an asshole
mimicking carl i heard youre not ready yet
were gonna kick your ass
well we may be behind schedule but were still going to beat that sonofabitch and maybe i havent scored with natalie yet but neither has he
shes not an easy lay thats what i like about her
you know what they say it aint over till its over
peter and michael go into the living room
peter is picking up glasses
michael is emptying ashtrays into the wastebasket
well i didnt do so well either i blew it with rosalie
i dont even know how
that beauty i managed to swipe
i was about to ask her to stay the night when
your old friend sophia appeared and got you involved in a thrilling conversation about modern art and meanwhile rosalie
how could you know that
michael all you want to do is steal jacks girl friends
you dont give a shit about the women themselves
thats not true
its just that sophia drives me crazy
she knows all the right buttons to push to make me mad
going into the kitchen anyway it was a great party everyone had a good time
still in the living room shouting to peter terrific
he too leaves the living room and runs into jack who has his arm around clementines waist as he heads toward his bedroom with her
in the kitchen peter is straightening up
michael joins him dumping the ashes
peter begins washing the glasses
did he leave
no hes cuddling up with a blonde named clementine
thats not clementine
i saw him doing his famous routine with christie
no it is clementine the one with the tits this big
christies got tits that big too
yeah but he was with christie at the beginning of the evening after that he was with rosalie and then with clementine
and since i stole rosalie away from him
are you following this
jack enters the kitchen in very high spirits singing
nice work if you can get it and you can get it if you try
any scotch left
yeah here i just put it away
sorry i cant give you guys a hand but ive got something cooking
i thought you were leaving at dawn for south america
i am the nights still young
its gonna be a lively one
im gonna make us a little snack
he makes up a tray with sandwiches
so who is it anyway christie or clementine
beautiful enchanting maxine
peter and michael look at one another surprised mouthing silently maxine
hey michael howd it go with rosalie
well things were going great until
your old friend sophia appeared and dragged you into a thrilling conversation about modern art and in the meantime rosalie took off with someone else
how did you know
i dunno lucky guess
well i dont give a damn anyway i have drawings to hand in to my editor three days from now and i gotta work all night anyway
so it was all for the best
but you better not leave that maxines phone number lying around because when im done
dont worry ill leave you her phone number on the hall table
if shes really terrific ill put a big x next to it
bye guys love ya
i wont wake you tomorrow morning
see you in three weeks
jack and maxine noiselessly exit the apartment
jack is wearing his pilots uniform
maxine pushes the button for the elevator
jack sneaks back into the apartment and leaves a note on the hall table that says maxine
next to the number jack has put a big x
jack and maxine exchange a brief kiss and go their separate ways
jack is in the cockpit with his copilot ron
the engines are revving
jack is checking gauges
he looks out the window idly and sees the crew of another plane walking across the tarmac
paul is one of the crew
paul sees jack and begins to gesture wildly but his voice is drowned out by the noise of the engines
just seeing paul is enough to remind jack about his package
i forgot to tell them about the package
to ron i gotta make a quick phone call
ill be right back
knowingly jack therell be plenty of girls where were going
oh cmon ive really got to make a phone call
what do you think im going to do pick up one of the new jersey delegates to the i
jack walks back towards the phone
as he walks we see that the plane is filled with ugly boring businessmen
in the architecture firm of which peter is one of three partners
the whole staff about people in all is gathered around a large model the project for a big amusement park
they all seem worried about something
jerry one of peters partners seems particularly angry
the models not finished the blueprints are a mess and you may as well forget the specs theyre a disaster
i know were talented
i know were good
then why is it we can never get organized
why is it were always behind schedule
look jerry architects since leonardo have always been behind schedule
its a tradition for
why break with tradition
because this is the chance of a lifetime for our company and there happens to be a deadline
there are millions of dollars at stake here
and our main competition had their project in three days ago
yeah but word around town is their projects a piece of shit
of course its a piece of shit but its a ready piece of shit
were just going to have to buckle down thats all
youre damn right we are
starting now everybody works around the clock
we have two weeks to be ready for the semi final selection
and we will be ready
and we will win
you want to know why well win
because were gonna cheat
ill go bribe the judges
i dont think this is a joking matter gentlemen
come on jerry
a secretary enters
theres an urgent call for you peter

its jack he says its super important
peter picks up the phone

well put it aside okay
no no we wont tell anybody about it
is that it
right we wont tell anyone
hey love n kisses to the brazilian girls vaya con dios old buddy
peter hangs up laughing
jerry gives him a dirty look
peter dressed in casual clothes knocks on the door of michaels room and peeks in
michael is asleep fully clothed on his bed
his drawing table is strewn with papers overflowing ashtrays and empty coffee cups
the lamp is still on
im going out for bagels how many you want three or four
opening one eye what time is it
cmon up n at em
up n at em yourself asshole i just went to bed
did you finish
nah i didnt get anywhere
nap times over
back to work
so how many bagels three or four
he buries his head under the pillow
peter opens the front door he stumbles over an object looks down at his feet he sees a wicker basket lined with pretty pink and white checked gingham
in the basket a tiny baby lies fast asleep her head gently resting on a lace pillow
peter looks at this object in amazement
there is an envelope pinned to the basket with the words for jack written on it
peter picks up the letter he opens it and reads
to himself you gotta be kidding
abruptly he turns and races back to michaels room
still groggy what
get your ass out here and see whats on the doorstep
mutters this has gotta be somebodys idea of a joke
they run to the front door
what is it
look for yourself
its a basket with a baby in it
reads michael the letter dearest jack here is the fruit of our love
take good care of her
i have to go to europe and japan for six months her name is mary
good luck love sylvia
what are we going to do with it
give it back to her mother thats what
but it says she went to europe
well well see about that dyou have her phone number
whose phone number
why the hell would i have her number
ive never even heard of this chick
you mean you dont know who she is
if i had to keep track of all jacks girlfriends id have to be a full time secretary
well what are we gonna do
hey look shes waking up
hey look shes crying
oh no this cant be happening

put it aside can you believe him
jack said that
yeah and he also said dont tell anyone about it anyone at all
oh so he told you about this
yeah he told me a package would be coming today but he didnt say itd be this
very angrily boy hes got a helluva nerve
just listen to the racket shes making
what are we sposed to do
brilliant idea lets call jacks mother
she lives in miami for christsake
she cant stop the baby crying from miami
well just to ask her advice
no he said not to tell anyone
but this is an emergency
you know what a pain that woman is shell be on the next plane here to move in with us
maybe i should call my mother
no please leave the mothers out of this okay
its only four days
we should be able to handle that besides you know the rule around here its fine to have a woman over once in a while but
michael finishes the sentence in unison with him
never for more than one night at a time
and that includes mothers
peter steps over the basket and heads towards the elevator
where are you going
im going to the store to buy some baby food
what am i supposed to do while youre gone
pick her up and hold her
panic stricken whaddya mean pick her up
ive never held a baby ill drop her
peter is already gone
peter enters the store and rushes right over to a store what aisles baby food on
down there by the meat section
peter heads for it purposefully
when he gets to the right aisle he stops short taken aback a vast range of products extends before him
he starts examining the baby food jars and cans of formulas going from one to the next not knowing where to begin
michael is still in the hall holding mary very clumsily in his arms
he is anxious
he realizes shes soaked
this disgusts him
he holds her at arms length she squirms
he goes and gets a towel from the bathroom spreads it out on the living room couch and lays the baby down on it
mary screams she much prefers michaels arms to the couch
a panicky michael picks her up again grumbling
okay okay dont cry like that
ill hold you ill hold you
he tries rather unsuccessfully to wrap the towel around the child
obviously michael is very put off by the smell coming from mary
peter is talking with a safeway clerk a woman in her s who is tall and heavy somewhat gruff and masculine in appearance and wearing slacks and a smock
so whats the best brand
depends on what your pediatrician recommends
oh right the pediatrician
but which one sells the most
pointing to a can this kind
oh so this is the best kind
its the cheapest
then its the worst kind
theyre all good sir
pointing to another can oh okay then i can take this kind
its got iron in it
is that good or bad
its very good
well why dont they all have iron in them
some babies are allergic to iron
pointing to yet another can oh okay well ill take this kind then
that kind doesnt have any milk in it
oh i see theres milk with no milk in it
some babies are allergic to milk
so whats the stuff that no babies are allergic to
oh okay ill take the soy formula
he takes a can
that ones advance
how olds your baby
peter tries to estimate marys size uh
about this old
mary is screaming in michaels arms as he walks her up and down the whole apartment
now there are three towels wrapped around her
michael is exasperated
he angrily sings her a lullaby
rock a bye baby on the tree top
stop crying now cmon stop
quit it will you
when the wind blows the cradle will rock
what is that jerk doing
milking the cows or something
when the bough breaks the cradle will fall
mary only screams louder
now peter is surrounded by three women arguing the store clerk standing with her arms crossed and haughtily looking down on everyone an efficient practical sort of young woman woman
and another thin pale woman whose baby is lying in a baby carrier in her shopping cart and who seems very nervous woman
does she have any teeth yet or not
that would give us a clue as to how old she is
i havent looked
coolly disagree ing to woman my grandsons only five months old and he already has two teeth
but my daughter didnt have a single one at seven months so yknow how many teeth they have
doesnt mean a thing
but didnt those friends of yours tell you what formula they usually give the baby
embarrassed no actually they had to leave unexpectedly
they had to catch a plane
to peter is she teething
does she drool
does she cry all night long
does she chew on her fists
does she put everything into her mouth
she acts out her words
i know she cant talk
but didnt those friends of yours tell you how old she was
as woman is starting to get on his nerves i told you they had to leave unexpectedly
or else you could weigh her that would tell you how old she is
see my five month old grandson weighs more than my neighbors grandson and hes nine months old
so yknow how much they weigh
doesnt mean a thing
so what about me
what should i buy
didnt they even tell you the pediatricians name
still calm no
you sure have weird friends
you have no idea how weird
or else her hair
does she have lots of hair
my grandson yknow he has so much hair you can make a ponytail with it
and i know some kids who are totally bald at a year and a half
so yknow how much hair they have
doesnt mean a thing
sarcastic gee hes really something your grandson is he good at math too
peter starts to pick cans off the shelf
look ladies thanks for all the advice
but i think ill just take one of each
to be on the safe side
to peter dont forget if the babys less than three months old you have to be sure to sterilize the bottles
peter stops and turns back
you know what
this must be a kidnapping
michael is rapidly pacing up and down the apartment vigorously rocking mary
as soon as he sits down anywhere to rest mary screams so michael pops back up and begins the marathon all over again
mary had a little lamb little lamb little lamb if that jerk isnt back in three seconds i swear ill throw her down the garbage chute
mary had a little lamb little lamb
the doorbell rings
well its about goddamn time
he hurries towards the door grabs the knob and throws it open
where the hell have you been
before him stands the apartment manager mrs
razzolini a squat little woman with a moustache
oh hi mrs
this package came for you
what a cute little baby
is it yours
no its not me i mean shes not mine
oh so its peters
no no its jacks i mean its not jacks its
someone loaned it to us i mean someone
and whats the little girls name
ooh what a pwetty wittle name mary
i didnt know you had a baby
yeah well i have to put her to bed now
you have to put her to bed
wheres marys mommy
shes not here
shell be back soon
michael starts to close the door
she pushes it back open and holds out the package
oh here this just came for you
they just dropped it off
can i hold her for a second
well like ysee
she doesnt like to be held by strangers
the apartment manager has already given michael the package and grabbed mary
she covers her with kisses
michael absent mindedly looks at the package
she loves to be held by strangers
hey shes soaking wet hmm no i think its number
want me to give you a hand changing her
oh no dont worry im used to it
faking a smile well so long mrs
bye mary ill come back to visit
razzolini regretfully hands the baby back
no sooner is mary back in michaels arms than she screams her head off
he closes the door his smile instantly fades
what a leech
and that other idiot isnt back yet
he throws the package onto an armchair in the hall
so you love to be held by strangers do you
in the baby food aisle there are now five women arguing
peter his arms still laden with cans looks uncomfort able
this guy doesnt even know how old his baby is and you dont find that strange
this guy asked for advice im giving him advice okay
if youre so paranoid why dont you run home and chain your kid to his crib
anyway i think someone should call the cops
the cops the cops i bet you call the cops every time your cat pisses on the carpet
peter slips away
peter comes in with bags in his arms
michael holding the baby dashes toward him extremely pissed off
what the hell were you doing
youve been gone for hours
this damn kids been crying the whole time
ive got a lot better things to do with my time
youre a real pain in the ass
flabbergasted hey how dare you speak to me like that
youve never spoken to me like that before
well what the hell took you so long
whatd you do go out for breakfast or something
i didnt even have time for a cup of coffee for chrissakes
will you please cut it out for a second huh
i didnt have any coffee either it took me forever at the goddamn safeway
okay well here take the kid ive got work to do
whaddaya mean take the kid
i cant hold her and make her bottle at the same time
and why should i be the one to hold her
cause its your problem
you found this kid
hey asshole im the one who found
her because im the one who was gonna get you some bagels for your breakfast and
jesus there she goes again
we gotta feed her something
yeah well you just dont feed a baby
first you gotta look and see if she has any teeth or not
to figure out how old she is so we know what to feed her thats why
peter attempts to look into marys mouth but she squirms
do you look on top or bottom
how do i know
try feeling with your finger
peter slides his finger over marys gums
i cant feel anything ill give her the stuff for newborns and hope shes not allergic to it
peter starts off toward the kitchen michael follows
and then well have to see if shes allergic to iron to soy or to milk you cant imagine how much stuff they can be allergic to
shes soaking wet did you buy any diapers
ill take care of this itll save time
he sticks mary in peters arms right on top of the bags and storms out
michael rushes in and stops short in front of the moun tains of diaper boxes that he starts examining in bewil derment
finally he approaches the store clerk
excuse me miss could you tell me which diapers are the most absorbent
i would suggest the ones that say ultra absorbent
yeah but which are better pounds or pounds
suspiciously depends how much your baby weighs
oh right how much she weighs
threateningly you wouldnt happen to have a friend who came in here a little while ago would you
michael grabs just any box of diapers
i have no idea what youre talking about
hes no friend of mine
michael takes off very very quickly
mary in peters arms is devouring her bottle
oh shit my slacks
goddamn her she took a crap
peter and michael have laid mary down on the couch taking care to place several towels between her bottom and the immaculate velvet
mary is squirming laughing feeling great
they have already gone through half a box of cotton in their attempts to clean up the crap
but its still all over on their hands on the babys feet and legs on the towels etc
hold her goddamn it
i cant hold her
this kids out of control here
just gimme the cotton
michael lets go of marys feet and she sticks them back in the crap
oh for chrissake dont just let go of her
then get the cotton yourself if you dont want me to let go of her
peter grabs a huge wad of cotton
take the towels off theyre full of shit
but the couchll get dirty
yeah but she keeps getting it all over herself
man this shit is sticky
we need cleaning fluid or something to get it off
how bout after shave
are you kidding
waste our saint laurent on babyshit
okay lets just put the diaper
on and the hell with it
michael hands him a diaper
peter tries to figure out how it goes on
these tape things do they go on the front or the back
how am i supposed to know
peter tries to slide the diaper under marys backside but she squirms and kicks it off with her feet
hold her under her arms im gonna try it this way
michael holds mary under her armpits
peter tries to put the diaper on her
whats more it would seem that michael didnt buy the right size the diaper comes all the way up to marys chin
what the hell kind of lousy stinking diapers did you get
theyre way too big
i dont think theyre too big theyre ultra absorbent
the more absorbent the better
peter has more or less managed to adjust the diaper
how the hell do these tape things work
hold her for chrissakes
my arms are getting tired
i got it
he tapes the diaper closed
i didnt make it tight enough
he tapes the other side the diaper gapes and sags
its not working
what about laying her down
no not on the towels theyre all covered with crap
michael lays mary down right on the couch
peter vigor ously undoes the tape and the whole plastic lining rips apart
what the hell is this friggin mess
oh man this is unbelievable

peter wearing a coat enters carrying packages that he puts down in the living room now transformed into a nursery
a makeshift changing table rubber wash basin baby clothes baby lotion talcum powder soap and baby shampoo etc
are all over the place
he drops all his purchases on the floor sits down on the couch and picks up a book in which hes instantly absorbed we see from the cover that its
a book on children

mary is lying next to him

an audible click mr
the living room is a total mess
a harrassed peter lying on the floor dreamily watches mary who is lying on her tummy in a sheet playing with a squeaky rubber giraffe
they look at each other as sober as judges
peter and michael are asleep in their bathrobes on the living room couches
peter has a child care book over his face
mary in her basket wakes up and utters a few little noises
the two men jump up and go over to her basket like robots
mary looks at them and smiles
michael is giving her night feeding
mary is falling asleep in his arms the nipple falls out of her mouth which goes on sucking anyway
michael is falling asleep too his head lolling over to one side
the living room is back to normal spic n span
theyve gotten rid of all the baby paraphernalia
basket is on one of the couches
mary is asleep
on the basket are warm clothes for outdoors a bonnet and a coat a full bottle cans of formula toilet articles and a pile of diapers
seated on the couches facing each other peter and michael are waiting for something
he didnt say what time
all he said was thursday
we could rot here till eight oclock tonight
well im prepared to rot here till midnight if i have to as long as we get rid of her
jack really could have called
he has to have gotten our message by now
well when he does call im gonna let him have it
that sonofabitch is on the beaches of brazil proposing to the whole goddamn world
and were here living in hell
hes gonna get his ass on the next plane back here
vacations over jack baby you better believe it
angrily damn right
beat softer its almost time for her bottle you know
on the street two men drive by on a motorcycle looking at the numbers on the apartment buildings
they stop a few yards from the entrance to peter michael and jacks building
they are being followed by the beige chevy that pulls ahead of them and parks just beyond them
in this car we recognize graton sitting with a partner
the two men who look like young tough guys punks get off their motorcycle and disappear into the lobby of the building
graton gets out of his car and heads for the building
he glances into the lobby then goes in
he watches the elevator floor indicator notes the floor it stops on then calmly returns to his car
peter and michael are still sitting on the living room couches
the doorbell rings
michael springs up and runs to open the door
peter follows him
on the doorstep stand the two punks
one of them is short and speaks with a heavy brooklyn accent
the other tall thin and creepy looking stands behind his buddy and doesnt speak
jack collins live here
yes he does
we came for the package
oh thats cute referring to her as a package
anyway you can tell sylvia shes a lousy stinking bitch
you can tell her shes got a hell of a nerve dumping her problems into our laps
did you guys have trouble
he wants to know if we had trouble
do you have any idea what its been like around here for the past four days
she could have at least given us a phone number or the name of someone to contact
surprised i dont get it
didnt they tell you we were gonna be here today
sure they told us
that doesnt make the last four days any less hellish than they were
well anyway theyre here now thats all that matters
peter turns and walks toward the basket
the next bottles in minutes
i made it already
its in the basket
whadda ya mean bottle
about an hour after her bottle she starts yawning
put her to bed right away or its pure hell for the next three hours at least thats what weve noticed
peter has returned with the basket
the punks look at the baby their eyes wide with disbelief
what the hell is that
sarcastic no its a very short teenager
of course its a baby
now listen carefully im giving you a can of the milk shes been getting
she loves it and more importantly
shes not allergic to it
i even put a can of the same brand in here for you but in powdered form understand
punk hears powder and catches on
i get it
shes all yours
he hands them the basket
punk grabs the handles
okay i got it
you can take her out now
take what out
im not taking anything out
wait a minute i dont get it
we take the basket and the milk thats all
we aint gonna take the
whadda ya mean whats inside

its a package deal
but what are we sposed to do with it

ymean i take it to the connection
yeah whatever you want to call it
are you sure thats the plan
you bet thats the plan
were not keeping her one more second
okay if thats the plan
he passes the basket to punk here hold this
okay so long
they start to leave pressing the elevator button
suddenly a little worried uh
maybe you could leave us the address or the phone number just in case
so we can find out how shes doing
the punks exchange a puzzled glance
oh yeah sure the address
feebly searching his pockets oh shit i dont have it on me
but ill call you
okay so long
the elevator has arrived
the punks quickly slip inside it with the basket
michael closes the door
peter plops down in the armchair by the front door
aah relief at last
you said it
now maybe i can get some work done
he disappears in the direction of his room
peter is sitting on something hard
he pulls it out from under him its a package
he looks at it casually reading care of jack collins
he tosses it to the side
suddenly it dawns on him
he leaps up grabs the package and runs into michaels room
holding the package what the hell is this
well a package i guess
was this package delivered to you
peter raises his voice exasperated by michaels calm attitude
when the hell did this package arrive
will you quit shouting
screaming even louder when did this fucking package fucking arrive michael
i dont know
oh yeah sunday mrs
razzolini brought it up
whats the matter
this is the package those guys came for not the baby you asshole
hey asshole yourself
peter nods and begins to bark orders
look out the window and see if you see them im gonna try to
catch up with them
michael runs to the window
peter runs like a madman through the apartment out the front door
he presses the button for the elevator
its in use
he opens the door leading to the stairs and races down them holding on to the bannister
he flies overwhelmed by anxiety
suddenly he trips loses his balance and makes a spectacular crash landing
the package gets a bit crushed and little individual packets of white powder spill out of it
peter stares at them in horror
what the hell is this
he picks up a few packets and examines them
oh god no
thats all we need
he starts to tremble with fear
he picks the packets up as fast as he can and hastily puts them back into whats left of the package then shoves it all into his pocket and continues
racing down the stairs
punk is attempting to strap the basket onto the motorcycle with a bungie cord
punk watches him coolly
wed be better off taking the subway
you want to ride the subway with a hundred grand in uncut dope go ahead
well we cant ride around carrying this baby basket
well get stopped by the cops
so go ahead take the subway and stop bothering me
im going to hook this onto the back seat
itll never hold man
desperately going at the hook and the basket goddamn hook
christ what a stupid idea hiding the shit with this kid
peter comes rushing out of the building
huffing and puffing oh thank god youre still here
theres been a terrible mistake
that wasnt the package you were sposed to take
it was another one
i have it right here
what do you mean
what other package
ill take the basket back and give you the other package here
peter takes the package from his pocket and is about to grab the basket
punk pushes him back violently
you aint takin nothin back man
but im tellin you it was a mistake
in a low but very aggressive tone you tryin to double cross us or something
beat it before i get pissed man
panic stricken in an equally low tone but im telling you ive got your package right here
theres been a mistake
a mistake my ass
now get outa here man or im gonna stick this right in your gut
he discreetly reveals a switchblade knife hes carrying
to punk start the bike
punk is about to get on the motorcycle
peter stops him
but im telling you ive got the real package in my pocket
to punk watch it the cops
peter quickly puts back the package in his pocket
a patrol car comes up next to them right beside the car in which graton is sitting taking in every bit of the action
to his partner terrific
i bet these morons screw up everything
one of the cops gets out of his car and comes over to the punks and peter
peter is scared stiff
whispering if you called the cops on us pal youre a dead man
all right whats that doing on the back of the bike
no one answers
you wouldnt by any chance be intending to drive with a baby basket on your motorcycle would you
of course not officer
wed never do something like that
so why did you strap it on in the first place if you had no intention of driving with it
so it wouldnt fall off
as he speaks peter undoes the bungie cord from around the basket and takes it off the motorcycle
no really officer they werent gonna drive off with it they were just watching it for me while i was doing a quick errand
to the punks thanks guys
punk gives him a dirty look
all right lets see some identification everybody
the punks exchange a glance
suddenly punk shouts go
they take off running in different directions
cop charges after punk and yells to his partner whos still in the car watch the guy with the basket
cop leaps out of the car gun in hand
peter stiffens with fear
all right asshole lets see some i
urbanely listen officer lets stay calm now
i havent the slightest intention of running
i am not a criminal
im an architect
a little your i
lets see it
im terribly sorry officer but i dont have any identification on me
i just came down with my baby to run a quick errand

i have to give her a bottle in fifteen minutes i cant go anywhere
i live right in this building let me go up to my apartment and ill get you my license immediately
you can even come with me if you like
all right lead the way
they disappear inside the building
peter is carrying the basket in his left hand his right hand is clenched on the horrible package hidden in his pocket
just then cop comes running back empty handed
graton gets out of his car and comes up to cop show ing him his badge
angry inspector graton narcotics
it just so happens i was tailing those two guys and now because of you clowns i lost them probably forever
thanks a lot
how could we know
listen your partner went in here with the guy and the baby
he lives up on the tenth floor
i cant go in because if he sees me my cover is blown
so could you please try not to lose this one okay

gotta be watched very closely
ive called for backup and its on its way
the elevator doors open peter and cop exit
key in hand this is it
please come in
can i get you a cup of coffee or something
ill just wait out here
peter enters the apartment and calmly crosses through the house carrying the basket
as soon as hes out of the cops sight he starts running like a madman down the corridor
he runs into michael who was just coming to meet him
hey whats happening
what were those cops doing
peter shuts him up grabs him roughly under the arm and leads him into his room closing the door behind them
peter speaks softly but hes totally freaking out he can hardly breathe
were in deep trouble
theres a cop on the doorstep
he didnt see you
he mustnt see you
were in deep trouble michael
tell me what
the package they came for wasnt the baby it was dope drugs a shitload of dope
we were stopped by some cops down on the street
but did the cops see the dope
no its right here
he takes out the package
well get twenty years if the cops find this on us
climb down the fire escape and hide it
michael takes the package opens the window and starts to climb out it when peter stops him
hey whatever you do dont lose the goddamn dope we gotta be able to return it to those dealers or were dead
those guys are serious
he starts down the fire escape then stops and turns back
oh by the way i put some water up to boil for her bottle
peter picks up mary grabs his wal let and leaves the room
when he gets to the hall he discovers that cop has joined cop to whom he is whispering something
peter holds his license out for them to see
heres my license
im afraid im going to have to ask you to remain in the apartment
the narcotics squad will be arriving any moment now
they want to ask you a few questions
what do they want with me
i dont even use aspirin
michael is buying a pair of scissors glue and a roll of scotch tape
then he buys a box of large diapers he chooses the ones that come in a box
michael leaves the supermarket whistling
michael is sitting on a bench facing the grass with his back to us he seems quite busy
as we close in we discover that he has opened the box of diapers and that hes holding one of them its plastic has been carefully cut out with scissors
casually glancing right and left he takes the individ ual packets of white powder out of his pocket and shoves them into a little plastic bag from the supermarket
then he carefully tapes the bag so its well sealed and flattened out and he inserts it into the diaper be tween the plastic and the absorbent fabric
next the diaper is taped up folded back up and put back in the box neatly packed between the other ones
michael closes the box again and glues it together so it looks as if its never been opened
he throws all the other stuff away in a trash can and grabs hold of his brand new box of diapers
he walks away
michael comes into the living room with his box of diapers and a bag of groceries
in addition to the two cops there are now three narcotic agents who are interrogating peter
he is holding mary
the basket is on an armchair
whats going on
dont worry michael its nothing serious just a little misunderstanding
did you give her the bottle
yeah i just gave it to her
did you change her
no shes soaking wet
okay ill do it
michael puts down his bag of groceries takes mary from peter and disappears with the box of diapers
in his room he lays mary down on his bed and starts undressing her
and whos he
hes my roommate
raising an eyebrow oh i see i see
no you dont see
there are three of us sharing this place
oh three huh
a regular mirage a trois
and its not
we all have lots of girlfriends thank you
uh huh so whats your friend do
hes a cartoonist
what about the other guy
hes a pilot
now thats interesting
to his colleague
get me those photographs the ones taken at newark airport
agent looks in his attache case
so does this friend of yours ever fly to south america
only north america
the phone rings
would you object if i answered it for you
not at all go right ahead
ive got nothing to hide
agent picks up the phone and listens
its a collect call from a jack collins in la paz bolivia
that wouldnt happen to be your pilot friend would it
the one who never goes to south america
yes it is him
agent hands him the phone
hello yes operator i accept the charges
agent gestures to agent to take a look around the apartment
agent slips away
would you mind very much if i listened
please go right ahead
agent picks up the other telephone
yeah hes fine too
yeah we left a message for you right
no it was nothing
special it was just i mean
to see how you were doing and all no no emergency
loud i said everythings fine
i dont know what youre talking about
oh yeah the package
yeah yeah it got here and was picked up uh huh
why didnt you call sooner
oh youre onto something hot well arent you the lucky one
so when are you getting married
forget it i was just kidding
well everythings fine up here
so have a good time
see you in a couple of weeks
peter hangs up
so does agent
now thats interesting
so you wanna tell me about this package and the hot something or other your friend lucked onto
in la paz
peter sits down stunned
mary is lying on michaels bed
he has just finished putting a regular diaper on her
then michael looks for the tampered with diaper in the box
he finds it checks that it is well sealed and places it under marys bottom
just then agent appears in the doorway
michael calmly finishes putting the dope filled diaper on the baby on top of the other one
mary is cooing
every thing appears normal
however a trained eye might be very surprised by the enormous thickness of the diaper covering the young ladys backside
but a narcotics agent is not necessarily the most qualified person to notice something odd like this
agent silently observes michael who gives him a big smile as he slips on marys pajama bottoms
michael picks mary up and for the first time talks to her in the kind of silly babytalk used by adoring parents
okey dokey honeybunch its time to go beddy bye now
were gonna take a nice long nappy wappy
he goes back to the living room followed by agent
agent is in the process of showing peter a photograph
do you recognize anyone in this picture
peter looks its the photo of jack and paul that was taken at the beginning of the movie
this is jack collins
now thats interesting
michael has laid mary down for a nap in her basket observed by the five cops
he now sits down cheerful and bubbling over with enthusiasm
can i get you something to drink
agent totally ignores him
so whos the baby belong to
its jacks daughter
and why are you two taking care of her
because her mothers in europe for six months and since jack had to be away for two weeks i took my vacation to take care of her i love kids
yeah peter and i just love kids
now thats interesting
well well be seeing each other again soon in fact very soon
meantime id appreciate it if you didnt leave new york in the next few days
all the cops head for the door
michael accompanies them putting on a very urbane act
come back anytime gentlemen
youre always welcome here
we have no particular plans to leave new york in the near future so dont worry about us now
once the cops are gone michael races back to the living room
peter has collapsed into his armchair
in a low tone christ what a mess
theyll be on our tails around the clock
how the hell are we gonna get rid of the goddamn dope
by the way where is it
also speaking in a low tone its cool dont worry i got it stashed
michael points to marys bottom
this way its close at hand
are you out of your mind
relax will you
i diapered the dope on her right in front of the cop and he never noticed a thing
i told the cops we were taking care of her
you realize were now stuck with the kid till jack
there aint nobody coming to pick her up and i have to go back to the office today
wait a minute
youre not gonna stick me with this kid
tell them you need a maternity leave tell them anything but weve got to go on this
and thats not all we havent heard from the punks yet either
hidden within a parked car three men are keeping a close watch on the entrance to peter michael and jacks build ing
the two uniformed cops emerge get in their car and pull away
on the phone things are heating up thats right you heard right im not coming in to work for two weeks
no i cant explain why
in a louder tone because i cant thats all
no this has nothing to do with chasing ass
will you stop screaming for a minute and listen
im in trouble you understand
yells goddammit jerry of course winning the competition is important to me
the firms my whole life if you must know
no no please dont send anyone over here

okay listen ill be there in a half hour but i cant stay long

he hangs up
michael enters the room with his coat on
i gotta go over to mr
oxmans he just called and hes freaking out
he says if i dont bring some cartoons over now the deals off

yeah but dont worry about it ill be back before its time for her next bottle

why dont you call oxman and tell him youll be there in a few hours
oxman is leaving in an hour
if i dont meet him before then i blow my dollar contract
oh shit i cant take this anymore
look maybe we could pawn her off on mrs
razzolini just for a couple of hours shes crazy about her
peter and michael get out of the elevator on mrs
they each are holding one of the handles on the basket
they are walking quickly
suddenly michael stops peter
wait i hear someone
ill go see
peter waits with the basket
michael tiptoes to the corner of the corridor
at the very end of the corridor on mrs
razzolinis doorstep he sees the three narcotics agents talking with mrs
we can hear snippets of their conversation
yes i brought a package up to them
i think it was last sunday
what are these people like
what kind of lifestyle do they have
michael hastily returns to peter still on tiptoes
he leads him back to the elevator and pushes the elevator button
whispering just as i thought the goddamn cops are grilling mrs
we sure as hell cant hand her the baby with an ass full of dope
right in front of the narcs
the elevator has arrived meanwhile
breaking down what should we do
i really gotta go
listen shes just had her bottle
shes sleeping like a log
lets just leave her in the apartment
what can possibly happen to her
shes as regular as clockwork
she wont wake up till and well easily be back by then
yeah youre right we wont be long
they rush into the elevator
the three men slumped in their car are watching the door of the apartment building
the three narcotics agents emerge from the building and walk away
a short time goes by
peter and michael emerge from the building and quickly walk away
the three men get out of their car cross the street and enter the building
peter comes out of the elevator key in hand
hes about to put it in the lock on the door but stops short the door is already open
michael are you here
peter pushes the door open
the sight that greets his eyes is very dismaying
it looks like a tornado has hit the house
everythings on the floor its all been smashed its all been ripped apart
gone is the beauti ful apartment that had been so lovingly decorated
in its place utter devastation and shambles
peter stands there speechless for a moment then an awful thought crosses his mind
he runs like crazy into his room the baskets not there
stepping over the debris and all the things strewn over the floor he rushes into the living room then into michaels room
the baskets nowhere to be seen
peter falls apart without even realizing it hes moan ing and muttering distractedly
he runs into jacks room into the kitchen into the bathroom
the basket is nowhere to be seen
peter runs all over back and forth ten times in all the rooms
tears are flowing from his eyes
suddenly he hears faint cries
theyre coming from the back bathroom
peter rushes to it practically ripping the door from its hinges
there on the toilet is the basket and on it theres a note written in big messy printing which says next time we take her
mary looks at peter and smiles she seems in great shape
a distraught peter picks her up hugs her tightly and kisses her all over as he takes her into his room
just then michael appears in the corridor silent and
he comes to the door to peters room and looks at him
peter mortified to have been caught kissing mary hastily distances himself from her hold ing her at arms length
he puts her down on his bed and exits the room
the debris has been shoved up against the walls
peter and michael in their pajamas and dead tired are slumped over the table
peter is giving mary her bottle
michael is looking at mary as though he were seeing her for the first time
peter is in bed completely out of it
michael is changing mary very carefully
he puts one diaper on her then the second one full of dope
he lays mary down in her basket then places the basket on the bed nestled between the wall and peters body
michael holding the soiled diaper silently goes out
once hes alone peter leans over the basket
mary and he stare at each other intently and seriously
peter switches off the light
the doorbell rings
michael asleep on his mattress on the floor in the middle of his wrecked bedroom emerges from sleep and glances at his clock its am
he staggers to the front door and opens it
the door is being held together with a string
agents and are at the door with four other cops backing them up
razzolini is standing behind them and staring wide eyed a look of horror on her face
can i help you
holding out a piece of paper to him search warrant
playing the gentleman waving away the paper i believe you officer
go ahead we have nothing to hide
razzolini turns her back on him and hurries away
the cops enter the apartment
youll have to excuse the mess
we had a few friends over last night
looking at the devastation oh really
well if i were you id get myself some new friends
peter comes in in his bathrobe furious
what the hell are you guys looking for anyway
probably the same things your friends were looking for last night
razzolini bring you a package last sunday
you mean the chocolate easter bunnies
we ate them already
he starts to walk away
anyway you have no idea how many packages weve been getting lately
its hard to keep track of them
maybe we can help
to his colleagues lets get to work
all the cops enter the apartment
peter is in bed with the basket beside him
a narcotics agent is rummaging through his scattered belongings
would you mind if i look in your
big smile my pleasure
try not to make a mess
peter gets up takes the basket off the bed and keeps it in his hands
the agent searches the bed
ill look in the basket if you dont mind
be my guest
he picks up mary with her huge diaper
the agent searches the whole basket
thank you very much sorry about this
he goes out
peter undaunted pats marys big behind
the cops are leaving
well theres obviously been a mistake
as far as youre concerned this investigation is closed
we apologize again
big smile oh dont mention it
it was a pleasure having you here
i hope youll find what youre looking for very soon
looking straight at him so do we
michael closes the door and races into the living room where he discovers peter putting on his jacket
softly did you hear that
he said thered been a mistake and they werent going to bother us anymore
bullshit its a trick
you think so
they just said that to put us off guard
they saw the condition this apartments in
they know the punks were here looking for the dope and that they probably didnt find it
so that means weve still got it
but he said the investigation was closed
okay lets just see how closed it is
ill go downstairs
you watch out the window and see if im being tailed
michael is peeking out at the street from the window above
peter comes out of the building and turns left walking very quickly
suddenly peter stops turns around and retraces his steps
we can clearly see a man who was walking about six yards behind peter on the opposite side of the street also turn around and retrace his steps
it is graton
was i right
theres one guy for sure
a redhead kind of young disguised sort of like a college student
i knew it
theyre going to be watching us around the clock
how are we going to get the dope back to the punks
i have the feeling theyll come to us

he quickly stabs the grocery bags three times well call you tonight
he runs off disappearing into the darkness
from the slit open grocery bag milk flows out onto the sidewalk
michael is shaking all over
standing about twenty yards away graton hasnt missed a thing
not far from peter michael and jacks building graton in his car is talking into the microphone of his police radio
my snitch told me the gang hasnt gotten the dope back yet but they will soon
they made contact with the two guys tonight no no they dont know im tailing them
these jerks are going to fall right into my hands
peter and michael are seated in the living room which is still an utter wreck
they cant take their eyes off the phone thats between the two of them
they are sitting silently not moving
mary is playing in her basket
the phone rings
peter and michael both jump three feet in the air
michael picks up the phone

he grabs the receiver out of michaels hand jack

the phone interrupts
michael leaps up and answers it

theyve hung up on the other end
michael hangs up and sits down drained
that was it
equally drained all we can do now is hope our plan works

graton is speaking into the microphone of his radio
next to him sits a cop with phone tapping equipment
very excited we got em chief

we see jack getting out of a taxi with his luggage and going into the building
jack emerges from the elevator happy as a lark and feeling frisky
opening the door yoo hoo guys
ive got presents for you
so wheres that wonderful fantastic babe
he enters and sees the state the apartment is in
what the hell happened here
he walks into the apartment shocked and overwhelmed
are you here
he goes into the living room no onesthere
into michaels room
no ones there
he goes into his own room where the destruction is even moreshocking than elsewhere since nothing has been touchedin there
oh my god
my beautiful room
my beautiful beautiful room
very angry michael
peter where the hell are you for chrissakes
he runs like a madman into peters room and stops short on the threshold
michael and peter are each holding a handle of the basket as they rock it gently
furious what the hell is going on around here
what happened to this place
what happened to my room
peter and michael look him right in the eye still rocking the basket
and anyway what the hell are you
swinging that thing for
silence answer me for gods sake
looking in oh my god theres a kid in there

he leaves a second later he comes back
its too late to try and talk me out of it

very calmly would it be asking too much of you to shut your big mouth for a few seconds
there is a child here whos trying to sleep
and thats another thing
i will not have a baby in this house
babies are not part of our agreement
softly michael please hold me back
or ill kill him
michael takes the basket handle from peters hand places the basket carefully on the bed and walks without a word towards jack who he takes by the arm and steers
into the living room
peter softly shuts the door behind them and follows
michael sits jack down in an armchair
he speaks with forced calm
all right jack
why dont we start at the very beginning
the very day you left for your vacation
hey will you please stop talking like mr
its getting on my nerves
his fuse has blown laughing hysterically his nerves
michael his nerves
you wanna talk about nerves
then just shut up and listen
it so happens we dont want a kid here either but when someone dumps one on us we take goddamn care of it
yeah we take goddam care of it
we havent had a decent nights sleep in two weeks
michaels probably going to lose a contract
peter couldnt leave
jerry almost jumped out the window
its lucky they even made it to the finals
first weve got the narcs on our ass then theres the drug gang threatening to carve us up
every three hours bottles
have you ever tried to do diapers
la paz bolivia
he calls from im onto something hot
did the package get there
and the day they wrecked the apartment peter came home and couldnt find mary
ive never seen him in tears like that bef
cutting him off embarrassed never mind about that
look jack you got us into this mess and youre going to help us get out of it
what are you guys talking about
and whos that fucking baby
for your information the fucking babys name is mary
and if i were you id watch what i said about her
because she just so happens to be your daughter
and it just so happens weve got a lot better things to do with our lives than wipe a babys ass even if shes yours
peter and michael exit slamming the door
peter is slicking his hair back with brylcream
jack is sitting on the edge of the bathtub with his arms crossed
he observes peter silently
mary is lying on the bed and michael is putting the dope filled diaper on her
peter is giving a tousled looking punk hairstyle to jack who is looking at himself in the mirror
i look ridiculous
you look completely ridiculous so what
mary wearing a bonnet and coat is lying on one of the couches chirping merrily
next to her also in his coat michael is just finishing wrapping a brown package which he puts in a plastic bag along with a book a baby rattle and
a clean diaper
peter and jack disguised as punks each with punk hairstyles and wearing black sunglasses are climbing out the window leading to the fire escape
michael exits the building
mary wrapped in a little woolen blanket is in his arms
michael is also carry ing his plastic bag
graton in his car is speaking into the radio mike
okay hes coming out alone
ill follow him
someone else stay here to keep an eye on the other guys
michael is lying on the grass near the fountain with mary on her blanket near him
graton is nearby also lying casually on the grass watching them out of the corner of his eye
michael glances at his watch then at the passersby
the punk from the day before walks by with his arm around a girl
he strolls by casually
he spots michael and their eyes meet
the couple sit down on a bench a few yards away and they begin making out
michael leans over mary coochie coos her and surrepti tiously takes off her diaper which he puts down beside him
he puts the clean diaper on her
graton nervous and wary watches michael and the passersby
just then two punks peter and jack come running up to michael
he ostensibly takes the brown package out of his plastic bag and gives it to them
the two punks immediately take off with the package
graton leaps up shouts lets get em and takes off after the punks followed by about other plainclothes detectives whod been hiding all around
michael quickly gets up picks mary up and discreetly deposits the dope filled diaper in a trash can giving the punk on the bench an intent look
then he goes off in the direction of the cops
the punk calmly goes over to the trash can takes out the diaper which he stuffs into his girl friends purse and goes off in the opposite direction
the cops have meanwhile arrested peter and jack who put up no resistance whatsoever
michael now joins them
whats going on
inspector graton narcotics
do you admit you gave these men this package
i gave it to them just a moment ago
to one of the cops officer will you please open this package in front of these witnesses
the cop opens the package its a box of chocolate easter bunnies
graton is mortified
he crushes all the bunnies theres absolutely nothing but chocolate inside them
is it against the law to give a box of candy to my friends
peter and jack take off their glasses
oh its you guys
whats the problem
you guys must think youre pretty smart dont ya
suddenly freezes holy shit
graton starts running like crazy back to the fountain
he rummages like a sick dog all around the spot where michael had been lying
suddenly he dashes toward the trash can and dumps out its contents throwing the garbage around like a lunatic
the goddam diaper
what a jerk what a goddam schmuck i am
peter michael jack and the plainclothes detectives watch graton going bananas
to the cops i think that guy needs a vacation
he should try south america
yeah i hear its nice there this time of year
the chief is standing behind his desk red faced with anger and graton sheepishly faces him
lets face it
youve got shit for brains
im sure the dope was in the diaper
can i go on tailing them
i have solid information your three suspects never had anything to do with the dealers or the dope
im sure the dope was in the diaper
im sure the dope was in the diaper
screaming did you hear me graton
im sure the d
in the devastated living room peter still disguised as a punk and michael both very high are dancing around in circles with each other and laughing
they are singing a lullaby at the top of their lungs and har monizing
peter is holding mary close and michael holding a near empty bottle of liquor staggers over to him and starts turning around in circles with him
mary snuggled up warmly between peter and michael is laughing her head off
in the b
in the hall jack also still in his punk getup is on the phone
hes got a glass in his hand and is a little smashed
paul hi its jack
hey listen i brought you back a little present from south america
can i see you right away so i can give it to you
yeah the sooner the better
i cant wait to let you have it
how about th and east river
a broadly smiling jack arrives at the riverside
paul is sitting on a bench
when he sees jack he gets up and comes to greet him smiling and extending his hand
without warning jack suddenly jumps him and sends him with a forceful shove flying into the water
paul lands on his back with a big splash and comes back up to the surface totally dumbfounded
jack leans over the water and yells at him like a madman still a bit drunk
that was for your little package and consider yourself lucky i didnt turn you in to the cops
and get one thing into your thick skull i have never touched dope
and i never will
you and your shit dealing you can go straight to hell and you can take the money you make from it and stick it up your ass
jack turns his back on paul and staggers off
hey come back
howm i gonna get out of here
in the living room michael is sitting in front of the tv
hes not really watching hes eavesdropping on jacks phone conversation
very aggravated listen sylvia youve got to come back
i travel i cant take care of her
yeah but youre her mother
im her father what makes you so sure im the father
the dates coincide
that doesnt prove a thing
but shes still your kid so do me a favor get your ass back here immediately and take her off our hands
cause weve got a lot better things to do with our lives than wipe a babys ass okay
sylvia goddam it
he slams the receiver down like he was hammering a nail shit
that bitch hung up on me
i could kill them
why dont you call her back
i dont have the number
i got a message to her through her agency they wont tell me where she is
i dont even know where she was calling from
and you better believe shes not going

the phone rings
michael answers it
no its michael

he hangs up
who was that
sylvia she wanted to know how mary was doing
jesus christ michael why didnt you let me talk to her
she would have just hung up on you again
the important thing is she knows marys fine
you shouldve said she was terrible sick as hell
practically on deaths door
exits furious what a jerk what a pain in the ass you can be sometimes
to himself whats with him
the kids doing really great
jack is on the phone in his room which is looking a little more normal again
hi how are you

a little girl mary
screaming coming over the phone

he hangs up gleefully rubbing his hands together
michael and jack are in the kitchen
michael is making some bottles
jack is watching him do it
youll have four already made thisll hold till miami
tell her to make sure mary gets plenty of sleep
ill tell her
if her ass gets red tell her not to listen to any pediatricians theyre full of shit
full of shit
then she should give her a bottle of water instead of the regular bottle
works like a charm her ass will be white as snow in three hours
nodding bottle of water white as snow
peter says her clothes should be washed by hand
really by hand
nodding and only in soap flakes without any artificial color or scent
and then rinsed three times in very hot water
docile rinse three times
to put her to sleep we sing in harmony it always works
my mother lives alone
solo works just as well
now as for the nipples youve got to be very very very careful
as soon as the hole gets too big shes gotta throw them out this is extra extra extra specially important cause if the holes too big the milk comes out
too fast and its bad for her digest
politely but a little in a hurry i gotta get going ill miss my plane
peter is returning from work
michael is in the living room eating a sandwich while looking through a magazine
how bout jack
on his way to miami
hes got a lot of nerve
leaving us with the kid again
no he took mary to his mothers she couldnt wait to see her
hes gonna try to unload her on her till sylvia gets back
i made her four bott
furious youre kidding

he really could have called me

exasperated of course not

i made her four bott
he could at least have told me
exits cursing i cant believe this
there are such things as phones
to himself four bottles for the goddam trip
there i finally got it out
a cab slowly pulls up in front of jacks mothers house
there is a big red convertible filled with four jovial senior citizens
jack comes out of the cab with the basket and stares at his mother margie whos just locking her door
next to her holding her luggage is steve a man in his sixties
they head toward the trunk of the car
hits steve hey he finally made it
to jack do you have any idea what time it is
you said two
but mom i missed the plane
yeah but now i have to go
where are you going
on a cruise around the world

because you never wouldve come

she grabs mary and covers her with kisses oh my little strudle

bye bye sweetie love
ill bring you back presents from all over the world
to jack giving back mary four oclock
she runs into the car and they pull away
everyone waving goodbye
holding mary bye
jack comes in with the basket hes in a vile mood
hes got a bottle ready in his hand
peter who had been working in his room rushes to the hall
youre bringing her back
i gotta heat this bottle up right away
they go into the kitchen together
peter immediately gets busy he heats the bottle up quickly while jack soothes the hungry mary by carrying her in his arms
so what happened
did you two have a fight
grim goddamn cruises
didnt she want to take her
sure she did but she was just leaving for some stupid cruise around the world
the entire fucking world
with some bimbo boyfriend of hers
and a bunch of retired bozos
the apple doesnt fall far from the tree
the doorbell rings
jack goes to the door
at the door stands a rather distinguished looking woman with her hair tied back very properly a suitcase in her hand
it is mrs
bretsaws who speaks with a british accent
im mathilda bretsaws from the second mommy agency
very eager very gracious oh yes i was expecting you
wont you come in
they disappear into the living room
jack shuts the door behind him
michael peeks into the hall then goes and looks into the living room through the crack in the door
peter too peeks in
who is it
must be some nanny he found through an agency
peter shrugs and walks away
jack comes out of the living room
softly to michael she wants to see mary
well she wants to see her anyway
he heads toward peters room
returning from the kitchen what do you want
dont go into my room shes asleep
yeah but the nanny mrs
bretsaws she wants to see her
no damn it no
youre gonna wake her up
it already took me an hour to sing her to sleep
yeah but she wants to see her
all right ill go explain the situation
holding him back with both hands no no peter please really dont go dont bother ill go explain it to her myself
its no bother jack
ill be glad to do it
he rushes toward the living room
sighing to michael wanna bet shes out of here in ten minutes slamming the door behind her
they tiptoe over to the living room door and eavesdrop
a sleeping child should not be awakened
if you dont know that then youre not fit to be a nanny
tense but still calm i never said that i wanted the child to be awakened sir
i only asked to see her
if im going to be taking care of the child on a round the clock basis then
round the clock
whaddya mean round the clock
are you intending to sleep here
a second mommy is a second mommy
and where are you going to sleep
well i expect you to show me to my quarters
well i dont know where jack intends to stick you
thats his problem
maybe in his room
but im warning you mrs
there are three of us sharing this place and were all real studs
behind the door jack rolls his eyes michael empathizes with him
they head back to the kitchen
and as for screwing i have all i need at home thank you very much
with a few days off every month im sure ill be fine
the only thing im interested in is the care of the child and i can tell she needs some
how do you figure that
shouldnt i be discussing all this with the father
well listen mrs
bratsnot lemme tell you something
with a child you always know who the mother is but the father thats another kettle of fish
so dont give me that bullshit okay
i wont discuss it any further with you
will you please show me where the kitchen and the bathroom are
so i can make you a list of the things we need
what do you mean make you a list
dont you do the shopping yourself
no shopping or laundry or housekeeping
i am a professional nanny
we have plenty of everything
do you have a sufficient amount of fruit and vegetables for the child
she only eats milk and cereal
thats not enough sir
from the age of three months children should be started on a normal varied diet
oh thats bullshit
you dont feed a baby like an adult
mockingly oh really
and how would you know
ive read plenty of books
the diet recommended by those quack pediatricians today is way too rich
im in favor of natural methods mrs
for instance if a child is having trouble getting to sleep what would you do
depends if it was a continuing problem i might recommend a mild sedative
exploding triumphantly i knew youd say something like that you jerk
anything you say sir
let me just remind you that i have my diploma and that medicine is a serious matter
do you know the song that goes medicines a whore and the pharmacist is her pimp
no i dont
we must listen to different music
personally im very fond of opera
breakballs if you dont get out of here right this minute im gonna punch you in the nose
this is my home now get out
the names bretsaws
i am blessed with infinite patience when it comes to children sir but im not qualified to deal with lunatics
goodbye and good luck
bretsaws grabs her suitcase and exits dignified and stiff as a broom slamming the door behind her
michael and jack are sitting at the table
looking at his watch what did i tell you
ten minutes to the second
okay listen you guys
ive tried everything and nothings working my mothers off on a cruise mrs
razzolini wont speak to us ever since the whole business with the cops we dont want to involve any of our girlfriends sylvias taking it easy in europe and theres
no way shes gonna come back now that michael went and told her everythings just fine and dandy
peter did a terrific job getting rid of mrs
bretsaws and all thats left are the daycare centers but peters positive theyre a breeding pit for a
so you tell me what are we suppose to do
you want me to split with the kid
or dump her in an orphanage
pretending to play the violin
here we go
look her motherll be back in less than five months
lets not waste a shitload of time looking for a solution for such a short time
lets get organized
what do you mean organized
well youll have to ask to fly the new york washington shuttle for five months on account of serious personal problems
id rather be a subway conductor
barking then dump her in an orphanage cause theres no way were gonna take care of her all by ourselves anymore
come on stop arguing you two
jack youre going to have to ask to do the new york washington shu
stubborn yelling no
unruffled that way you can do the a
that amounts to two bottles and two diaper changes
you do the shopping when you get home in the evening and thats all
peter youll take the p
thats two bottles and two diaper changes her bath and her laundry
since i work at home ill take the longest shift from a

i have too much work to catch up on for the competition
well needless to say i refuse too

my shift is eight hours in a row
no way im gonna do nights too
she can scream all she wants i dont give a shit
you know jack youre a real slime ball

goddamit shes your daughter
are you that horny
extremely pissed off hey horny yourself
i dont give a shit
i dont need you guys
ill find some other way to do it
and i wont take the new york washington shuttle
he exits furious
jack is coming out of an office that says executive offices
he is grim and sullen looking
he runs into his friend paul who jumps three feet away to avoid a potential mishap with jack
shyly hi jack something wrong
who hadnt noticed him oh hi
nah nothings wrong
what were you doing in the bosss office
i was asking to do the new york washington shuttle for a few months
oh and he said no huh
barking as a matter of fact he said yes
paul backs up against the wall protecting his face with his arms
jack leaves disgusted
paul watches him go totally confused
jack is sitting on his bed wearing a dressing gown
hes got a sleeping mary in his arms
the basket is on the floor beside the bed
jack attempts to put mary back in her basket but she shudders and he immediately sits back down again and doesnt move
mary falls back asleep
jack looks at her skin her hands
very gently he kisses her forehead
mary smiles in her sleep
michael is working at his drafting table
jack rushes in wearing his uniform ready to go out
okay im off
shes well fed and shes sleeping now
we hear mary crying
shit shes crying
ill go pick her up
peter passes him in the corridor
he too is ready to go out to his office
let her cry shes just trying to get to sleep shell stop in a couple of minutes
no she needs to burp ive gotta rock her for a little
im telling you the more you pick her up the longer itll take her to get to sleep
thanks for the advice now why dont you just shove it
i know you let her scream for hours but i cant
in a state of shock i never let her scream for hours
youd resort to any theory to not take care of her
just because youve read some books
can you believe what he just said to me
i read those books bec
its not your shift anyway

come on guys cool it
its my shift now
to jack ill rock her for a few minutes
to peter and then ill put her right to bed
so off to work both of you
he pushes them both out
its noon the sun is shining brightly
michael is diapering mary on her changing table
he tickles her bites her toes neck and ears she bursts out laughing
michael is totally gaga over her
coochie coochie coo
woo woo woo
bippity boppity boo
peter comes rushing into the apartment and runs toward his room
he stops short in the corridor he hears marys laughter and michaels coochie coos
noiselessly he tiptoes over to the living room door and listens troubled
then he walks away and shouts as though he were just coming out of his room
hi michael i just came back to get a file i forgot
michael stops his baby talk immediately as though sud denly paralyzed embarrassed guilty
peter enters the room
without looking at him yeah okay
not moving well i guess ill be going now
not moving either yeah
theyre both uneasy
the baby okay
not budging an inch yeah okay
peter enters the bathroom
hes carrying mary whos naked and wrapped in a towel
peter carefully locks the door behind him
he removes marys towel and sits her in her little tub filled with warm water
mary quivers as she comes in contact with the water
peter kneels down and very gently pours glasses of water on her shoulders and head
the water streams down her face
she blinks and laughs
peter whispers lovingly to her in a barely audible very low voice
mary stares at him
peter is wearing a different suit and mary is almost one year old with a lot more hair on her head and able to sit up a lot better
although it is dark we can distinguish in jacks bed a rather bulky shape which is moving around under the comforter and doesnt exactly seem to be sleeping
suddenly from the direction of the living room we can hear mary crying
jack emerges from under the comforter and switches on the light he has a female guest in his bed a pretty brunette this time
to himself shit shes crying
ill be right back
he gets up slips on a bathrobe and goes out of the bedroom carefully closing the door behind him
he goes into the living room picks mary up and showers her with kisses
mary stops crying immediately and lays her head on jacks shoulder sucking her thumb
jack rocks her for a moment then puts her back to bed
mary instantly starts crying again
jack very quickly picks her up again and kisses her
mary is delighted by his tenderness
jack puts her back to bed again
mary cries again
it beddy bye time now honey beddy bye dont cry sweetheart
mary keeps crying jack picks her up again
peter and michael in their pajamas their faces swollen with sleep enter the living room
in a soft voice shes crying
hushed voice yeah every time i try to put her back to bed
hushed voice maybe shes thirsty
no her back teeth must be starting to bother her
what should i do
ive bought some stuff for her gums
he rubs some of the medication on marys gums
try and put her back to bed well sing
jack puts mary back to bed
michael as a routine sings a major chord giving each of them their notes
they start singing a lullabye in three part harmony as they lean over the crib
mary is in seventh heaven
she looks up at them she stops crying she sucks her thumb
the brunette is listening to the male chorus totally amazed
this guys totally whacko
she gets up slips on a t shirt and exits the bedroom
she stops at the door to the living room and contemplates the three men who are singing earnestly around the crib
in a loud voice hey choir boys you gonna keep it up all night
peter and michael stare at her scandalized
jack gestures wildly to her to shut up and go away
oh my god

she goes back to jacks room
hissing who the hells that broad

into the kitchen
he exits furious
peter and jack follow after him
fuming they file one after the other down the corridor past the stunned brunette in her t shirt who was waiting
for jack by the door to his room
the three guys close the kitchen door and start yelling at each other
they all talk at once
ive had it with you assholes

the guests watch in uncomfortable silence

somewhat sharply whos her mother anyway

michael is buried under the three tiered cake unable to see around it
do you guys want some cake
in her crib mary is sleeping
shes beautiful she looks happy
mary is in her playpen playing with a squeaky rubber giraffe
the doorbell rings
peter opens it standing there before him is a very very young gorgeous girl
bursting with joy hello

they both enter the living room
mary stares at sylvia
when she spots mary sylvia suddenly breaks down in tears
peter is dumbfounded
i dont believe how much shes grown
recovering wiping away her tears she walks over to the playpen
hello mary hello my darling
she picks her up hugs her tightly showers kisses on her
sylvia starts crying again
how beautiful she is
her hair has grown
look how much she changed i missed it all

peter in a kind of daze stares at sylvia
without looking at peter she dries her eyes and tries to stop crying
i wanted to make life difficult for jack but i never thought id miss her so much
still in a fog oh yeah
make life difficult for jack
is he here
is jack here
snapping out of it oh yeah yeah ill go get him
he exits like a sleepwalker and goes straight into michaels room
the latter is asleep
peter sits down on the edge of michaels bed and gently shakes him
michael wakes up and looks at peter
peters giving mary her bottle jack is carefully putting all her stuff into a bag bottles nipples cereals etc
in the doorway sylvia with reddened eyes silently watches them
to himself lets see the five bottles the little bottles for water the strainer for her cereal
to sylvia do you have a blender
for bananas and carrots and stuff
its time for her to start eating them
no i dont have a blender
okay you can have ours
he stuffs the blender into the bag
mary has now finished her bottle
to peter do you want me to take her
no i have to burp her first
with dexterity he places mary face down on his shoulder and walks around in the kitchen patting her on the back
to sylvia here could you give these to michael so he can pack them with the clothes
he hands two bibs to sylvia
sylvia walks through the apartment and stops in front of michaels room where she looks strangely at the changing table with its mattress its pretty sheet and the babys toilet
sylvia enters the living room
michael has spread all of marys clothes neatly folded and ironed on the couch
he is packing them in a big bag
here are the bibs
jack told me to give them
taking the bibs thanks
i put the woolen things on the bottom and the diapers and lighter things on top because youll need those first
her mind is elsewhere yeah sure
michael bustles about
sylvias gaze comes to rest on the crib which stands imposingly in the middle of the living room
music boxes little booties and stuffed animals are hanging from the bars and a pretty white tulle frames the crib
youll have to come back and get the crib later
a taxi is there
behind the wheel the driver sits waiting
sylvia is sitting in the back on the side nearest the sidewalk and on her lap is mary whom shes gently fondling
on the sidewalk beside the open trunk of the cab are all marys belongings some bags the playpen a stroller the baby bathtub the changing table etc
peter is attempting to pack it all in the trunk
michael is handing the things to him
tense give me the playpen first
equally tense then where are you gonna put the tub
annoyed just give me the playpen

no no thanks
id rather do it myself
jack is standing beside the back door of the cab leaning over toward sylvia who is holding mary
he is trying unsuccessfully to sound angry
you really screwed us over but good you know that
i know im sorry
our lives have been out of control for the past six months
yeah i bet

she starts to cry again

peter and michael approach
thats it we fit it all in
the three men are lined up on the sidewalk
mary stares at them looking a little lost
they wave their hands and bye mary
mary laughs and waves
with a big sad smile okay well thanks again bye
the car starts up pulls away and disappears from view
playfully well thats that
they head back to their apartment building
oh shit i forgot to explain about the cereal

different women every night

first with this goddam competition
and then with natalie
and ive got six months worth of sex to catch up on with cathy nora frances susan barbra
they have entered the elevator
the doors close
they come out of the elevator in front of their apartment
christie paula sheila lisa kimberly rhonda rebecca louisa
but not necessarily in that order
they enter the apartment and peter walks on something that lets out a terrible squeak
oh she forgot her squeaky giraffe
he picks it up and throws it onto an armchair
jack takes a running jump and does a cannonball into the pool of a luxury hotel somewhere in the world
he splashes two girls who find it very funny
peter with a bouquet of flowers runs like mad down a street
michael and sophia are having a big discussion about contemporary art in the midst of a sophisticated crowd at an opening
michael is vehement gesturing wildly and so is sophia
theyre both talking at once not listening to each other and enjoying it immensely
peter all out of breath comes rushing into the office where natalie works
she is very surprised
he puts the flowers down on her desk
these are for you
im not supposed to leave the office
they think im in the bathroom
so i cant stay
he dashes back out
natalie cracks up laughing
jack is running on the tarmac he quickly mounts the stairs to his plane as he waves a heartrending goodbye to a young woman hes left behind in the airport
at the top step he bumps into another young woman its
love at first sight
michael is in bed
its noon the suns shining brightly and a blonde is asleep beside him
michael is on the phone
ill call jack were gonna celebrate tonight
he hangs up
the blonde is now awake
he won the competition
peter enters the apartment with natalie
a bunch of crepe paper streamers are hanging in the hall as well as posters with various things written on them jack comes running in with a bottle of champagne
he pops the cork
jack hugs peter tightly as michael comes in with glasses and tries to catch the champagne thats flowing all over
they all shout and go bananas celebrating
peter has his arm around natalies waist
shes a little drunk
he kisses her and leads her into his room clos ing the door behind him
michael and jack who were spying on them tiptoe over to the door
they are silently exulting over peters second victory
michael enters a fancy building on th avenue
hes carrying a big portfolio and is full of beans
in the lobby he pushes the button for the elevator and looks around absentmindedly
his gaze suddenly freezes on something
by the guards desk he notices a stroller
inside look ing pretty bored is mary
michael is overwhelmed
he walks toward mary and through the sea of people they exchange an intense look
he looks around and suddenly sees sylvia and two men deep in discussion coming out of an elevator
michael startled runs and hides behind one of the elevators staring out wide eyed
sylvia is dressed in a very chic tight black suit with a veiled little black hat and spiked heels
one of the men is carrying a bunch of cameras
they walk out toward the front door and sylvia suddenly stops
she seems to have forgotten something
she kisses them goodbye and heads toward the elevator
once shes out of their sight she turns and waits for them to leave
when theyre gone for sure she rushes toward mary and showers her with kisses
here you are my angel
are you okay honey
mommys finished now youve been a very very good girl
to guard thanks a lot for looking after her
oh shes been great
she wheels the stroller over to the door and quickly takes off her high heels and her hat and stuffs them into a big bag
she takes out a pair of old shoes and a comfortable jacket and slips them on
she removes the pins from her hair she looks like her normal self again
she leaves pushing the stroller out the door
michael stands frozen
jack in the corridor of a large modern hotel somewhere
in the world
he is full of energy and playful excite ment
hes with a few of his colleagues both men and women
they say good night to each other
everyone goes into his or her own room
jacks the last one he goes into his room alone
his smile drops
for a moment he stands there just looking
he sits down on the bed on the pillow is a little chocolate santa claus with a card that reads merry christmas
the marriott hotels
jack contemplates it forlornly
michael and sophia both in kimonos are sitting in front of the last bits of an elegant midnight supper in michaels room
the bed in unmade
sophia a glass of champagne in her hand is yakking away nonstop like a real motor mouth
michael silent is doodling on a paper napkin
his pen is making little squares and circles the circles come together and start looking like a baby lying in a crib
sophia is absorbed in her monologue
suddenly michael realizes what he has drawn
he crumples the napkin and throws it in the wastebasket
sophia hasnt noticed anything
michael is bored stiff
peter comes home with natalie
they take off their coats
they look tired
in a bad mood oh my feet are killing me
she takes off her shoes and collapses in the armchair in the hall
there is a loud squeaking noise
she reaches underneath her and brings out a rubber giraffe
what the hell is this
oh its a giraffe
tosses it away and walks off oh by the way have you
heard anything about that kid you know the one you had here for a while
peter stares at the giraffe horrified
he feels the tears coming to his eyes
grabbing the giraffe he hurls it with all his might against the wall
jacks in his plane at the controls waiting for takeoff
his co pilot comes in and joins him
hey whats the matter with you
whadda you mean whats the matter with me
are you sick
didnt you see who weve got on board today
sure i did why
turning around to look so its the rockettes so what
and youre just sitting there like that
whaddaya mean sitting there
i happen to be getting ready to fly this airplane
okay forget it
jack alone in his room with his back to us is facing his full length mirror
hes looking at himself with one fist on his hip and the other hand clutching a half empty bottle of scotch
he observes himself and slowly turns around we can now see him in profile
his hair is disheveled hes unshaven and hes put a pillow underneath his sweater
he takes a big swig of scotch
the doorbell rings
jack walks away from the mirror
he staggers dead drunk
but dignified pregnant
jack opens the door
standing there is graton holding a stuffed animal a rabbit
out of it hi
dont you recognize me
in a total fog wait
im the one who was tailing you
remember in the park
oh yeah the park
the diaper and all
thats it the diaper
but dont worry
this isnt an investigation i left the force four months ago and anyway theyve arrested the whole gang since then
i just wanted to ask you something
have you noticed
neutrally oh yeah i see
so shall we go for a walk
graton and jack are sitting on a bench beside the east river
jack still pregnant has brought along his bottle of scotch and he takes a swig from it occasion ally
graton has brought along his rabbit
theres something i have to know
wouldnt you like to be pregnant
look theres been something bothering me for a long time
you see if i was god and i could create the world all over again heres what i would do i would create adam from eves rib not the other
having trouble following really
thats an interesting idea
actually i just wanted to ask you
at least that way things would have been clearer to begin with ysee
they wouldnt have made us believe that somebody could come out of our rib yknow
cause nothing ever comes out of our rib yknow
only out of our prick and even then everything still has to be done after that
very unsure thats for sure
what we men know how to make is planes buildings cars and all that stuff
its useful mind
its driving me crazy
this thing keeps going around and around in my head
and you know what its not even like they wanted us to believe it it might have been us who wanted to believe it
but lets face it nobody comes out of our rib
dives right in was the dope in the diaper yes or no
still thats hard to take goddam it
was it in the diaper or not
it was in the diaper why
getting up oh thanks a lot
i feel so much better now
here this is a rabbit for your baby
shakes both jacks hands thanks again bye im so happy
graton goes off floating on cloud nine
reaching out toward him with the rabbit but wait the babys gone
jack and michael slumped in their chairs are having breakfast
its a gray day
its pouring out
peter bending over a bowl of steaming water with a towel over his head is inhaling the steam
when he looks up to speak we see his swollen tear streaked
extremely in fact too playful tomorrow san francisco
grim say hello to the pacific for me

emerging from the bowl congested youll be id a foul bood jet lag really wipes out you dow
annoyed whaddya mean now

a sudden weighty silence ensues
this fuckig cold
i look like ib cryig all the tibe but ib dot its just this dab cold
he gets up and goes out
jack holding a bouquet of flowers and gratons rabbit rings the doorbell of an apartment
on the door a card reads sylvia and mary
a chubby young man with thick glasses opens the door
is sylvia in
no shell be back in a couple of hours around midnight she said
wanna come in and wait for her
he follows the young man in sylvias studio
its very messy
on the table theres a big heap of books and papers
mary sitting on the floor is wearing a diaper and a sweater but her legs are bare
shes playing with an empty pack of cigarettes
she looks at jack with a serious unruffled expression
sylvia doing okay
i dont know im a med student
im just babysitting
i only met her a couple hours ago
oh i see
the young man sits down at the table and immerses himself in his books
mary doesnt look up from her pack of cigarettes anymore
listen on second thought i dont think ill wait for her
just give her this when she gets back okay
and this is for the baby
jack hands the bouquet and the rabbit to the young man who plops them down on a chair
sure no problem
he immerses himself again in his books
jack heads toward the door then turns around
shouldnt the baby be in bed by now
i dont know
when i put her to bed she cries so i just let her stay up
dont you have any tights to put on her legs
well its pretty hot in here anyway
jack gets out of there in a hurry
jack in his pilots uniform is sitting on the living room couch
michael is standing before him
you want me to call them
but youve got to let them know
no im not going anywhere anymore ive had it with traveling
cmon ill call you a cab youve still got time
dont you call anybody
but the planes sposed to take off in half an hour they wont have time to replace you
this is serious youll lose your job and you wont be able to pay your share of the apartment anymore
jack takes off his pilots jacket and throws it aside
ill be a dishwasher ill live in a flophouse
what the hell happened
im not going i told you im not going ever again
im sick and tired of traveling sick and tired of broads
they all have the same asses and i cant seem to love them anyway
i cant take another hotel room and swimming pools and trendy restaurants
i want to know
what my lifes all about
do you know what your lifes about michael
michael has no answer to these questions
michael wearing an apron and holding a wooden spoon goes into jacks room
the latter lying on his bed is smoking and staring at the ceiling
come on i made us a good dinner
i bought some filet mignon and haagen dazs butter pecan
when peter comes back hell cheer you up
hes been here all day
i didnt hear him
hes in his room
michael heads towards peters room
jack feebly gets up and follows him
michael knocks on the door
still no answer
michael opens the door peters lying face down on his bed
hes holding the rubber giraffe and sobbing
michael and jack dismayed stare at him
peter hides his face in his arm
jack and michael go to the kitchen and sit down to their steaks totally depressed
the doorbell rings
a bare chested michael in jeans drags himself over to the front door and opens it
there stands sylvia with mary in her stroller
sylvia is a disheveled mess
is jack here
cause im a mess
i cant handle it im all alone
shouting towards jacks room jack
jack cmere for chrissake
cause my place is tiny yknow and my schedules insane and i just finished four days of posing and we ended up every day at
jack bare chested comes in pulling on his jeans
he stops short at the front door
sylvia is about to cry
to jack yeah ysee jack i just did four days of posing
and every day we finished at three in the morning and since mary always gets up around
well you can imagine how much sleep ive gotten
yeah of course cause after the bottle it starts all over again around nine
and by the time i change her and play with her a little its already eight oclock
and then thats it you get only an hour of sleep
and the babysitters till three a
all my money is sucked
down the tubes
plus they dont put the kids to bed they let them lie around half naked
oh so the flowers and the rabbit were from you
i could have strangled that guy
i mean it i cant cope anymore
my parents and i dont talk to each other and anyway they live in texas and the baby needs to get out to the park
yeah tell me about it
finding time to take her to the park every day is a real bitch
and i have to work i need the money to survive and anyway i love my job
a distraught peter bare chested and in jeans comes running in from his room
but to work ive gotta have a babysitter and to have a babysitter i need to work so i run around all day
she sobs and im not sure im taking good care of her
of course youre taking good care of her we know what its like dont cry she looks great
sobbing its just cause i havent slept in four nights she must be teething or something i dont know but i cant manage
dont worry its nothing shes
cutting a tooth you just have to put some stuff on her gums
she pulled the same thing on us
we lost all our friends in one night on account of one tooth
and just look at my face
nobodys going to want me to model for them with the way my face looks
and whatll happen to me if they dont want me anymore
but youre beautiful at your age all you need is a good nights sleep and youll look like new
right a good nights sleep but when
well why dont you leave the baby with us for a few days till you recuperate
i mean if you want
were old pros its not a big deal for us
blowing her nose wiping her eyes really
i can leave her with you for a little while
leave her with us
come back whenever you want
get some rest
sylvia between two sobs picks up a big bag beside her on the doorstep
i brought a couple of things for her just for a few days
michael eagerly takes the bag from her
its followed by a second and then a third
taking mary in his arms is she hungry
yeah its time for her bottle its all ready in the bag
ill go heat up some water right away
would you like a cup of coffee
oh okay thanks
peter carrying mary towards the kitchen is followed by jack and michael with the bags
sylvia blows her nose and walks around aimlessly in the hall
in the kitchen the three men bustle about with the bags the bottle the saucepan
theyve swallowed all their pride and are kissing mary all over on her neck her hands her tummy
theyre deliriously happy
michael takes some sheets out of the bag
ill go make up her bed
he exits and once in the corridor prances around leaping and dancing
he gets to the living room and goes over to the crib suddenly he recoils and freezes a fearful expression on his face
then he turns and races back to the kitchen
floored hey you guys come and see come and see
come see i said
jack and peter nervously follow michael into the living room
they stop short in front of the crib there is sylvia curled up in a fetal position sucking her thumb and sleeping like an angel
the poor thing shes really wiped out
shell need two or three months to recover at least
we could set up a room for her here
a room for her and a room for mary
then we could have four shifts instead of three
yeah but i dont think shell agree
shes got her own life to live
yeah she probably wouldnt want to move here
shed think wed jump on her any chance we could
but wed make a rule shed just be one of the guys
shell never want to
very awake so ill take the ten a
to three p
and ill take every other night
plus the walk in the park in the afternoon before i go to work
and we split the rent equally
and ill just be one of the guys
smiling broadly deal
mary suddenly comes in from the kitchen walking unstead ily but determinedly
shes dragging gratons rabbit by its ear
she looks at the four of them and laughs her head off
