written by alan schoolcraft brent simons headlines flash before us displaying their accompanying photographs
photo a chiseled statuesque man wearing the coolest super hero suit imaginable complete with flowing cape shines a confident smile at the lens
this is uberman champion of photo wide shot of uberman in mid flight lifting the giant robot in the sky above the city buildings
photo uberman stands knee deep in water
he has his enemy by the collar
the villain blocks his face from the shot with a the images start to flash by even quicker each showing the mysterious villain in various stages of humiliation
in each photograph he successfully blocks his face with his armored glove
we zoom in to the last headline
photo uberman stands in a gallant pose with his fists on his hips obviously trying to accentuate the u insignia on his chest
we dissolve from the photograph to uberman standing in the exact same position
we pull back showing him atop a building overlooking the city below
a perfect view for our guardian hero
he watches the thriving metropolis bristling with life as people happily go about their day
yet we cant help but detect a hint of sadness in ubermans expression
you look so peaceful from up here
his serenity is suddenly interrupted by a loud beeping sound coming from his wrist
he looks down at a bracelet a manly one on his right arm
its a silver band with a flashing red letter u
looks like roxannes in trouble again
uberman leaps off the building and into the air
his cape gracefully flows in the breeze behind him as he shoots off into the distance like a speeding bullet
grime and moss decorate the outside of this long abandoned building overlooking the coast
once a place of knowledge and wonder now home to a great evil
the inside is in complete contrast to the exterior
the huge hall with a giant telescope teems with advanced electronic equipment
computers monitors and machines which do not have an obvious function flash and hum
a steel door slides open revealing the subject of our story master mind a villainous sight to behold
his face is inexplicably light blue topped by an oversized mushroom shaped head with a circular patch of white hair on top
hes dressed in the kind of costume only a super villain could pull off a purple jumpsuit and black boot ensemble with a giant green m on the chest
his right hand hanging at his side is a metal gauntlet with three short spikes master mind begins to survey the room with his two a man dressed as albert
einstein is busy ranting to two other men
one a hulking brute is dressed as leonardo da vinci
the other a small intellectual type carrying a clip board is dressed as the philosopher plato
i hate the outfits
i mean i get it were all supposed to be masterminds very clever
einstein contd i just feel stupid
i mean what the hell did einstein really do anyway
theory of relativity
einstein starts feverishly scratching his side
well youd think hed invent a wool sweater that didnt itch so much
da vinci and platos eyes suddenly grow with concern as they see master mind walk up behind einstein
einstein notices his colleagues staring over his right shoulder and turns around
he turns around and master mind seizes him by his throat with his metal gauntlet
the real einstein once said god does not play dice with the world
he was right because the world is my dice
is that understood
gasping for air yes sir
master mind undoes his grip on einsteins throat
alright then clean slate
do we have the girl
she fell into our trap just like you knew she would
reporters are a curious lot and easily manipulated
he quickly checks his physique in a giant mirror adjusts his posture and sucks in his gut
alright lets not keep the lady waiting
da vinci escorts a blindfolded and bound woman roxanne ritchi to the back of the room where plato and einstein are standing guard over a large black swivel chair facing
away from us
she pulls free of da vincis grasp and waits for him to undo the blindfold
her face uncovered we finally see roxannes striking features all of which seem overshadowed by piercing eyes that seem more put off by the situation than afraid of it
miss ritchi we meet again
the chair turns menacingly slow finally revealing master mind
you didnt need to turn around like that
i can recognize the stench of failure
master mind unleashes a wicked laugh
i trust you gentlemen know the very sassy roxanne ritchi highly regarded investigative journalist who some say has a more than friendly relationship with our super powered foe uberman
and miss ritchi i trust youve already met my new crew the mad geniuses
roxanne gives einstein a once over
looks like a real group of winners
at the risk of sounding cliche youll never get away with this
in a way i already have
roxanne unleashes an exhausted sigh
we go through this every time
you kidnap me to get to uberman he immediately finds your hideout escapes whatever lame trap youve come up with and takes you and your cronies to jail
i propose we just save everybody some heartache this time by you letting me go and me forgetting this whole thing ever happened
what about my revenge
we can say it was wasting everyones time
you have a wicked tongue
i hope you rid yourself of that when youre my queen
roxanne unleashes a snort filled laugh
what makes you think i would want to be your queen
power corrupts absolutely miss ritchi
and when i have ultimate power over this city i have absolutely every intention of corrupting you with it
master mind turns to plato whos now standing at a computer terminal
annoyed what is it
uberman flies toward the observatory like a rocket
uberman crashes through the wall to the room we were just in
he looks around but theres suddenly not a soul in sight
the boat is shooting through the ocean away from the observatory
machines cables and terminals criss cross the crafts main bridge
through the enormous surrounding windows we can see the observatory shrinking in the distance
master mind watches uberman on a small tv monitor as the hero intently searches his hideout
on monitor master mind
uberman throws up his arms in frustration when suddenly over here old friend
he turns to see a familiar blue face of evil on a giant whats the matter miss your old jail cell
uberman starts walking toward the monitor
actually i wanted to share the experience with my oldest friend
a mechanized cage shoots out of the floor suddenly trapping metro citys protector
totally unfazed our hero stares on
you cant possibly believe this will work
master mind pulls out a small black box with a single red button on it
oh cant i
i have attained control of the earths most abundant energy source
i doubt even you are strong enough to withstand the full concentrated he presses the button
a sinister looking satellite orbits earths atmosphere
its bay doors suddenly open deploying two huge solar panels
the panels shift angling themselves in the direction of the sun
they immediately start glowing as they absorb the burning stars power
the front of the satellite begins to make a loud humming sound as it prepares to unleash its unholy power
from the giant window we can see the boat is a good mile from the observatory
were now at minimum safe distance master
master mind turns from the camera he was broadcasting on and puts down the control box
stop here i like this view
twenty seconds until impact
master mind turns to roxanne who is being held by da vinci and einstein
she almost appears a little bored
disappointed by her lack of horror he walks over to the monitor now showing uberman trapped in the cage
any last words
uberman looks up at the screen with a cocky smile
yes theres no caging the power of justice
ten seconds to impact
on the screen we see uberman take two of the cages bars in his hands
master mind stares at the monitor slightly confused
uberman yanks on the bars again this time using his foot as leverage
genuinely concerned whats going on
master mind looks back at plato and einstein
theyre equally befuddled at the heros sudden weakness
uberman loses his grip and falls backward on his ass
master mind and the minions all cringe in unison
da vinci turns to roxanne not believing his ears
what did he just say
master mind begins to laugh
what kind of trick is this
uberman looks up at the camera with a very grave expression
like you dont know
these bars are made of copper arent they
uberman tries to shield his grief with his hand
you figured out my weakness damn you
i cant bend copper
your weakness is copper
everyone turns to the window
the satellite fires a giant beam of light toward the earth
the beam hits the observatory
the building instantly explodes in a white nova blast of fire
the blast is so bright everyone turns away from the window
then as suddenly as it began the awesome light dies out
one by one the passengers unshield their eyes and look out toward the observatory
all we can see through the haze of destruction is fire and smoke
i dont think even he could have survived that
einstein suddenly turns giddy with excitement
is it me or did you just finally destroy uberman
carefully skeptical well
lets not get ahead of ourselves
da vinci suddenly sees something outside
look theres something in the sky coming this way
master mind turns toward the window
an object is in the air flying directly toward them
as it closes in we can just make out the familiar outline of a everyone scatters and braces themselves for the impact
master mind seeing all the good places taken doesnt know what to do with himself
he just covers his giant head with his hands
the figure crashes through the window and lands at his feet
he looks down to see a charred black human skeleton
around its neck is the unmistakable black cape of uberman
roxanne breaks out of da vincis hold and runs over to the body
she stares down at the still smoking corpse the tattered black cape with the yellow u on it
roxanne turns to master mind whos still visibly dumbfounded at the grotesque sight before him
you killed him
roxannes eyes roll back
da vinci catches her from behind as she faints
einstein turns to master mind looking at him as if hes just walked on water
you did it
now that hes committed the impossible our villain is at a complete loss
so i did
i mean i know you always wanted to
i mean all the schemes all the plots i never thought youd actually be capable of it
giddy as a school girl einstein turns to his fellow henchmen
this is history
every villain and lackey in the history of villains and lackeys dream of this moment but when does it actually ever happen
a sudden realization comes over his face
you do all realize what we get to do now dont you
his question is met with acquisitive looks from master mind and the others
we get to go on a crime wave
crime wave montage set to fun fun fun by the beach boys
its driving along when the men inside suddenly notice something theyre flying high above the city streets
we pull back to see the truck being carried by a giant claw at the bottom of a brain copter
inside the cockpit master mind and his henchmen laugh maniacally
da vinci and einstein run out the front of the bank holding two beat officers see them and take chase after them around the corner and into an alley
after a moment the police reemerge from the alley screaming and running for their lives as a giant robot chases after them
the robot stops then suddenly its head opens up like convertible car top with master mind and plato at the drivers wheel
they smile and shake hands at a bad deed well done
its heading for downtown metro as master mind and the lackeys coolly look on
three large dump trucks pull up filled to the brim with bricks of cash
the drivers jump out as the lackeys take the driver seats in the three trucks
master mind is about to climb into the passenger seat of one when a drivers taps him on the shoulder and motions toward the tornado
absentmindedly oh right
master mind pulls a television remote from his pocket and aims it at approaching windstorm of death
he presses the button marked tornado off
the tornado shrinks and disappears just before it hits the city
as they drive through the city streets master stares out the window with a hint of something in his eyes
is it melancholy
its metro citys premier bowling alley
on top of the neon lit building is a giant foot tall cement bowling ball
hal stewart early s takes careful aim with his bowling its a sport of honor focus and grace
honor the ball focus on the pins release the ball not hard and fast but as if you were releasing a baby dove
he takes a step pulls back his arm and releases the ball following it with his eyes
its a horrible shot instant gutter ball
an aged barmaid type with a cigarette hanging from her mouth looks over at him
okay do something like that but center it more
she picks up her custom made foghat ball and takes aim
tell me how my form looks honey
hal focuses on the misshapen bumps of her enormous johnson administration era derriere
oh its lookin good
its lookin real good
it doesnt get anymore clear
this man is a pig
hal i want to see you in my office
hal turns to see vinnie owner of the bowling alley calling him
hal sits down facing vinnie whos sitting at his desk
leave your shirt and locker key
this bit of news hits hal like a freight train
are you going to tell me why
showing up to work late
showing up to work late drunk
sexually harassing customers
stealing from the register
vinnie i dont know where youre getting these accusations vinnie takes out a video tape from his desk drawer and puts in a vcr
oh which one do you supposedly have here
this is all of them at once
a woman walks up to a bowling employee and hands him a pair of shoes
as the employee turns to the wall of shoes a very drunk and disheveled hal comes running in and pushes him aside
ive got this one benny
can i help you find your glass slipper
yeah im looking for a seven
he folds his arms on the counter and leans into her with a cat like grin on his face
with a leer seven well maybe i could interest you in something in an eight
disgusted she walks off screen
suddenly realizing the registers open he quickly grabs a stack of cash and shoves it in his pocket
vinnie turns off the television and waits for hal to respond
from the angle of the camera i can see where you might have gotten the wrong idea
listen vinnie i dont think youve thought this through
if you fire me whos gonna be captain of the alleys bowling team
um i dont know
maybe somebody who can actually bowl
you guys have never won a game
i hired you because you said you were on the pro circuit
no i said i will be on the pro circuit
please a loser like you will never amount to anything
this harsh remark seems to leave hal genuinely stunned
if thats how you feel
i guess we should then talk about what kind of severance im gonna get
two bruisers open the door and throw hal out onto the street
he quickly picks himself up and turns back toward the building
what about my ball
a bowling ball sails past him just missing his head
the massive building with a giant on the roof stands in the heart of metro city
the cubicles and offices are alive with the hustle and bustle of a busy news day
phones are ringing reporters are talking and editors are the elevator doors open and out steps roxanne ritchi
everything stops as the entire office suddenly falls silent
somewhat taken aback by the reaction roxanne scans the room to see every eye on her
its good to be back
thanks for everyones cards and concerns
i really appreciated it now im ready to climb back on the horse
no one is budging their looks of pity are really starting to make her uncomfortable
the back office door suddenly opens and out comes frank bonin the gruff middle aged producer of channel news
noticing the silence he looks up and sees the sad expressions on everybodys face
someone die or something
he suddenly notices roxanne both feet are placed firmly in his mouth
cursing himself oh jesus
frank quickly walks up to roxanne and takes her gently by the arm
come on into my office sweetie
he sits her down on his leather couch then quickly turns toward his door
can we get this woman some water for gods sake
to rebecca i gave you two months off
whatre you doing back
people are gonna think im a slave driver
yeah but i dont want people to think it
i want to go back to work
i need to go back to work
youre hysterical arent you
frank sits down on the couch and blankets roxanne with a warm whatre you doing
keeping you warm before you go into shock
toward the open door a secretary quickly enters with a bottled water
she sets it on the table in front of them and leaves
roxanne pulls herself out of franks grasp and stands up to face him
it was a traumatic experience
yes everyone knows uberman and me were
but what i really need what would really make me better is getting back to work
theres a sudden awkward silence from frank
well thats going to be
i thought youd be happy to have me back
oh we are
honey nothing makes us happier than to have our girl back but
things have sorta
in three weeks
listen im not one who likes to open up wounds especially ones that are just starting to scab but you were sorta our go to girl for the exclusive on
and now that hes gone
i moved brad into your anchor spot
the man is an idiot
its the suits
they think its time to switch things up
oh because they cant use me to get the big story
using is in the nature of what we do
they used you you used uberman
defensive i didnt use him
oh i didnt mean that
i know you two were in love or something
and thats great
very in love
theres a hind of self doubt in roxannes expression as if shes failed to convince even herself of this
so where are they going to move me if brad has my spot
bake sales and pet stories
i told them i wouldnt be surprised if you just upped and quit
you busted your ass for that desk
roxanne can hardly get it out shes busy swallowing her pride ill take it
frank looks up at her not believing what hes hearing
amongst the jungle of high rises one small building stands out from the rest a tiny forgotten piece of th century gothic architecture
lightening flashes revealing two concrete gargoyles holding a cracked plaque reading metro city library
a mixture of old and new
dusty victorian furniture and dilapidated bookshelves sit side by side with pristinely futuristic machinery
the building has been converted into master minds new secret
in the center of the main room is a three storey tall glowing blue orb
at the base of it is a sign that reads reactor dont touch
we pan over to the reading room where master mind is sitting on a couch watching television
its been nearly six weeks and still no word on the whereabouts of billionaire playboy and philanthropist wayne scott
tune in at as we look into what has become metro citys biggest mystery
we now return to the hero of our hearts the uberman story
einstein and plato come into the room holding a bag of loot
just robbed the diamond exchange
feigning pleasure great great
put it on the pile
einstein tosses it on a large pile of purloined valuables in the corner of the room
anything else today
master mind turns his attention back to the screen
plato sees that master mind is in a funk and tries to snap him out of it
cheerfully sir the new reactor is installed
plato nods to the giant orb
do you want to throw the switch
i know how you love to start reactors
einstein gives master mind a funny look then exchanges glances with plato before leaving the two of them alone
without turning away from the tv master mind addresses plato
what is it plato
nervously sir i cant help but notice that youve been
a little down lately
when i want your opinion ill beat it out of you
yes sir i know but please forgive my impertinence
its just that you seem to have lost your lust for our profession
youve stopped going on jobs and spend most of your time watching uberman specials
master mind relaxes slightly and turns to face the window in a classically contemplative pose
after an overdramatic beat
i have defeated my greatest enemy
i have free reign over metro city
i have more wealth than a thousand sultans
ive achieved all i have worked for
so why am i so unhappy
he walks over to a painted portrait that looks almost exactly like him except slightly older maybe meaner master minds i mean my father god rest his evil and tormented
soul raised me straight from the test tube to be a symbol of evil
master mind contd and i have accomplished something he had only dreamed about the destruction of metro citys champion
i tell you ive always lived with this unquenchable thirst
i thought it was to make him proud or to get absolute power
but now that ive pretty much accomplished both i am at a loss
i sort of have a theory about all that
snippy oh really
well for one thing maybe uberman was more important to you than you thought
he was a worthy rival
sometimes i wonder did he consider me his evil equal or was i just an annoying little gnat to him
whats the second part
i think you sort of have a thing for roxanne ritchi
master mind quickly takes his lackey by the throat
sir your plans always involve ms
ritchi either being kidnapped or placed in danger
if thats not love i dont know what is
its the grown up equivalent of dipping her pigtails in the ink well
dont you see
shes the one treasure thats always escaped you
from master minds expression we see platos words beginning to ring true
roxanne is having lunch with several girlfriends sitting around her gabbing
i cant believe you came back so soon
are you sure its not too soon honey
i just wanted to get back to work
what we need to do is get you back on the saddle
the love saddle
friend and give disapproving looks
its been three weeks
she just lost the love of her life grace
a waiter comes by with a tray of caesar salads and begins setting them out for the ladies
i keep trying to tell people it wasnt really like that
uberman and i we were kinda having problems
we broke up
the waiter almost drops his tray at this
the women are too shocked by roxannes revelation to notice
you broke up with uberman
you must have really really high standards
i mean you were dating a god
i mean whats it take
maybe someone whos a little more aware of his faults
someone a little more sensitive
someone who listens sexy but attainable with cute little cheeks like a hamster and heartbreak in his eyes
she turns to friend one and two to explain
she wants john cusack
no the famous pediatrist yes the actor
ever since we were teenagers roxannes totally had the hots for him
well until he miraculously comes walking into my life im just going to take a little reflection time for myself
the waiter gets a confused look on his face then slips away as roxanne and her friends continue to chat away
the waiter tosses his apron in a trash can then rolls up his sleeve and presses a strange looking device strapped to his his image gets staticy like a tv
station going out then disappears revealing the mans true form underneath master who the hell is john cusack
a young mother pushes her baby stroller past a building construction site
a local politician addresses a group of reporters on the sidewalk including roxanne
the fifth avenue renovation project which i championed will breath new life into the downtown area
new life means new jobs and new revenue
councilman is it true that your brother in laws construction company won the contract for this project
look im not here to answer a lot of crazy questions
the young mother stops halfway down the block reaches into the stroller and tries to comfort her now crying baby
above her a crane is maneuvering a pile of steel girders to an upper floor
hal comes around the corner and heads in her direction
the crane grinds to a halt
the operator has a confused look on his face as he moves levers back and forth in an effort to fix the problem
hal stops a few feet from the woman and stoops down to tie his shoe
the operators hand slips off the lever hitting a red button
to his horror the crane drops its load of steel
the woman looks up to see the girders seconds from crushing her and her baby
hal looks up and sees it as well
he starts to run out of the way and crashes into the woman and stroller
the reporters turns their cameras just in time to catch on film what appears to be hal pushing the woman to safety just as the girders crash to the ground
tears of joy in her eyes the woman picks up her baby and kisses it
hal struggles to catch his breath as the mother turns to him
thank you for saving me and my baby
she hugs him with her free arm weeping with joy
not knowing what shes talking about huh
hes a little uncomfortable with the womans public display of affection and the small child in between their embrace
hal slowly eases out of the womans grip
okay we better
well i hear these little guys smother easy
the reporters rush over and surround hal and the mother
whats it feel like to be a hero
hal looks up at roxanne
instantly hes captivated by her beauty
im just a man doing what men do
youre roxanne ritchi arent you
theyre suddenly interrupted when another reporter pushes his way in between them
were you scared
who had time
the reporters eat this up
john cusack stands in the rain looking up at a window of a two story house
he holds up a boombox and in your eyes by peter gabriel begins to play
from the couch master mind and his minions watch
john cusack huh
so all i have to do is have a cute puppy dog stare be willing to make a fool of myself and oh remove both my balls
he turns to see da vinci watching the movie and wiping a tear from his cheek
please get a hold of yourself
roxanne is carrying a large paper coffee cup in her hands as she peruses the isles
she sets it down on a shelf to pull a book out and ends up knocking the drink over
she goes to pick it up when someone bends down and picks it up for her
looking up to thank him roxanne is suddenly stunned speechless its popular and critically acclaimed actor john cusack or rather master mind disguised as him
oh the humanity it was a venti
yes its me
he notices the book shes reading
hey is that shelly
wait i think remember something from that one lets see my head is screaming i want you and need you my heart it keeps reaching to see you and feel
you yet in the end im alone once again
wow i scare even myself
im just really into poetry
probably because im so sensitive and always going to great lengths to express myself
but enough about me
can i fill you up
catching herself i mean excuse me
can i fill you up
roxanne talks as john cusack listens to her every word intently
i did have a boyfriend until fairly recently
she suddenly begins to feel the stares around her as passers by being to notice who shes with
im sorry this is so surreal
yeah they charge way too much at these places now back to your boyfriend
im interested and compassionate
i want to know about you
things were complicated
he was a man married to his work
there was a lot of competition in his line of business
im sure you know what thats like
in my business one thing i have is rivals
for example mine is
the body builder who used to play the hulk on tv
well were always up for the same roles
did your boyfriend have someone like that
a particular rival that was always getting his goat so to speak
one rival in particular seemed to get more of his attention than i ever did
but enough about my problems
suddenly realizing his outburst he begins coughing to mask it
i got a whooping cough
had it ever since serendipity
i fakes cough see there it goes again
please go on
right well he seemed to need him more than he needed me
how do you mean
it was conflict he thrived on
he always said he wouldnt know what to do with himself if master i mean this guy were gone
it was like he needed it like oxygen
the answer to his mental funk hits him like a bolt of lightening
he turns away from her as if for private time
almost to himself i think i finally understand
the only logical answer is to recreate that rivalry or if thats impossible create one of equal structure
john cusack snaps out of his dream like haze realizing shes heard every word
oh sorry sorry
just rehearsing for a part
where i play a man who talks to himself at inappropriate times
in a sudden rush he rises out of his chair
i have to go right now but id really like to see you again if thats alright
roxanne looks up at him she cant help but laugh at the craziness of the situation
id love that
master storms in the office to find plato and einstein playing darts with the original mona lisa
got her nose
ive got it
everyone stops what theyre doing upon seeing that their master has returned
ive got it
its plain and simple
extraordinary minds need extraordinary stimulation
without that stimulus they wither and die
therefore there is only one logical conclusion i must create a new superhero
yeah maybe thats not such hot idea
ignoring him prepare for operation superhero genesis
the lab is slick white and ultra modern
dressed in a lab coat master mind enters through a sliding glass door rubbing his hands excitedly
prepare the subject
he glances down into a large hole in the floor to see a naked thirty year old man severs shivering
above the hole a huge vat dangles precariously
master mind steps behind a glass partition next to plato and einstein
plato pour the toxic waste
plato throws a switch causing the vat to tip hundreds of gallons of green and brown goo into the hole
the slime is sucked out through the floor leaving a goo soaked severs
master mind looks into the pit
i feel fine
just a little sticky but aside from that everythings completely boom severs explodes
a hail of blood and tissue covers master mind and his men
for a good ten seconds nobody moves an inch
through a glass water tank we see a man breathing normally
and this one
we attached gills to him
he can breath under water
does he have extraordinary strength
can he fly
resilient to weapons fire
he just breathes under water then
master mind rolls his eyes and walks away
the next guinea pig stenwick is standing in a sealed glass tube not much wider than himself
plato the radioactive spider please
plato throws the switch dropping a single spider onto stenwicks arm
stenwick looks and winces as it bites him
he brushes the spider off
sir i didnt know this was about spiders
i have a pretty severe case of arachnophobia
master mind thinks for a moment then turns to plato
were gonna need more venom
plato throws another switch this time dumping thousands of spiders on poor stenwick
his screams begin to fade as hes engulfed with swarms of crawling arachnids
how bout now stenwick
master mind is pacing back and forth
the muted tv plays in the background
this has proven to be a challenge
i just dont know what i want
what do i want
he stares at einstein da vinci and plato but they offer no advice
i want a man of moral fiber with a strong sense of right and wrong
someone who doesnt seek power instead they must have it thrust upon them and find within themselves the courage to rise to the occasion
einstein lets out a short laugh getting everyones attention
yeah well it sounds like what you want is uberman
master mind snaps the fingers of his non metal hand
why make a copy when the real thing will do
the lackeys look at each other they cant believe what theyre hearing
i was just kidding sir
in case you forgot you actually burned uberman alive
then well make a new one
plato bring me the box
master mind and the lackeys stand in a circle around a small table
plato places a stainless steel chest in the tables center
as master mind opens it hes immediately doused in white glow emanating from inside
the very thing that gave uberman his superhuman powers
where the hell did you get that
oh i shot him with a power sucking gun and had this idea to use this to clone a whole army of evil ubermen
im not sure why i never got around to following up with that
i believe he defeated you before you could master
man he was good
you want another volunteer sir
not another volunteer driven by the need for personal gain
somebody else somebody pure
master mind turns to see an interview with hal playing on the muted television
underneath his face is a blue caption with white lettering that reads hal stewart metro citys newest hero
who risked his own life to save that of a young mother and her child
please please youre embarrassing me
i saw someone in need and i helped them
what more can we ask of ourselves
i ask you what more
a smile creeps across the evil ones face
somebody like him
plato is sitting in the van staring into a pair of binoculars as he speaks on a cellphone
this guy is a real piece of work
he used to teach bowling at kingpins
master mind is sitting with his feet up on a computer console as he speaks to plato
into phone a modest profession to brilliantly hide his true heroic nature
i love it
then you are absolutely going to love this we follow platos line of sight across the street where we see hal playing with a large group of blind children
he volunteers at a school for the blind
intrigued he suddenly sits up in his chair
he doesnt ask for any reward for his deeds
the fates are shining down on me
stewart is truly an unselfish soul
from a distance hal seems to be consoling an upset child whos sitting on a rock
but up close
you greedy little bastard
i already gave you a twenty
hey you want me to play along
then pay up bitch
fine but you better be convincing
he gives the kid a bill out of his wallet and looks over his shoulder to see a hot teacher walking toward them
here she comes go to work
like a miniature brando the blind kid buries his face in his hands and begins to cry
weeping why cant i see
hal puts a warm consoling hand on the weeping boys shoulder
cmon champ let me look at you
the hot teacher stops and curiously watches from a distance
the boy looks up at hal tears running down his dark sunglasses he should get an oscar
you know in life were all given no more than we can bear
this happened to you maybe because you were meant to rise above it maybe to be an inspiration to the other little peteys out there
you really think so hal
hey does it look like im lying
now cmon go feel your way to class before you get your little butt suspended
the boy stands up and is about to take off
petey wait a minute
hal uses his shirt sleeve to wipe the tears away from the boys face before sending him on his way
the hot teacher grabs her chest
her heart is about to absolutely melt
dont run into anything
plato lowers his binoculars
from his perspective hal should be next in line for popehood
i think ive seen enough sir
this is your guy
over radio then return to base
we have much work to do
plato starts up the van and pulls away
its a busy night
a couple of trucker types are shooting pool as the bartender slings drinks
hal is nursing a beer at the bar when he suddenly notices a very attractive woman sitting next to him
as he goes to straighten his stool posture hal suddenly catches himself on the bars television its a story about how he saved the woman and her baby at the
he turns back to the attractive woman next to him then back to the tv
a plan of attack is forming
obviously playing it up for the womans benefit oh there it is again
this is really getting embarrassing now
the woman looks up at the screen and gives hal a double take
oh my god
youre the man who saved that woman and her baby the other day
it is you isnt it
trucker getting a drink at the bar next to them
hal rolls his eyes and puts his hands up in the air
to attractive woman oh crap
you got me
trucker taps hal on the shoulder
let me tell you something
that was just about the bravest damn thing ive ever witnessed
he turns to the rest of the bar hey everybody
this guys the hero from the bar erupts in cheers
hal is riding on the shoulders of trucker and trucker as im holding out for a hero plays on the jukebox
trucker suddenly puts his hands in the air
the room quickly goes silent
i want to give you something
he reaches into his pocket and takes out a medal
he holds it up in the air for everyone to see
lost my whole platoon
they were a lot a good boys a lot of good boys
that was just the way things were in the grenada
id rather a real hero have this
trucker gives the medal to a speechless hal
hey youre on tv again
the crowd looks up at the television
the anchor man brad helms early s amazing mustache suddenly has a memo passed to him
this just in
upon a second look at that tape from this morning which well now replay for you it appears it was not the heroic act it first seemed to be
the tape shows hal running in slow motion
with the tape slowed down you can actually see the man push the woman and her child out of the way in an effort to save his own life
the tape shows hal in a clear act of self preservation pushing the woman and child out of the way
in unison everyone turns their heads back to hal
i guess that looks kinda bad
trucker snatches his medal back
master mind da vinci and plato look down spotting hal cutting through a dark alley
there he is boss
da vinci hands master mind a fantastic looking silver rifle
now were sure this wont kill him
hell just feel a slight electrical shock
master mind raises the rifle and aims it at hal
hal wipes the blood from his nose with his shirtsleeve
a lightening bolt suddenly zaps hal in the back
his teeth spark and arc electrons as his entire body shakes and shudders violently
he finally collapses knocking over a row of garbage cans
an angry master mind slaps plato
slight electrical shock
hal lies flat on his back his jacket smoldering
dazed he slowly rises to his feet and looks up at the sky
god i hate the weather in this city
hal walks off into the night as he attempts to slap the emitting smoke from his jacket
master mind turns to da vinci
its a dirty small studio
laundry lies everywhere dishes are piled in the sink and the litter box looks like a minefield
hal comes staggering in
through his pov we see the lights wobble and streak like a hallucination
he shakes his head trying to clear thing up but it looks worse
hal makes his way to the kitchen table and plops down on a chair
the room begins to swim
his cat jumps on the table and sits down in front of him
from hals pov the cats face looks like were seeing it through a kaleidoscope
hal seems fascinated by it
you dont look so good man
i dont feel good
i was struck by freaking lightening
suddenly hal realizes his cats talking to him
you can talk
no youre just hallucinating
by the way were out of orange juice
hal jumps up trips over a cardboard box and knocks himself out on the coffee table
hal lies in the same position we left him last night
he sits up and grabs his head
he looks like he has the worst hangover in the world
finally he remembers last night
he looks around but not really sure what hes looking for
shaking his head he walks to the kitchen and opens the refrigerator
he pulls out an orange juice container and puts it to his mouth
as if suddenly remembering something he looks from the carton to the cat who is busy cleaning himself
he shakes the thought from his mind
hal lifts the seat and unbuckles his pants
he stares at the ceiling with half closed eyes
the inevitable sound of urine hitting water starts
a content look washes over his face
there is a distinct sound of porcelain cracking and the sound intensifies
hal looks down to see his urine stream oh god
he whips his stream away only to cut a long rip in the wall
he freaks out and begins to lose control of his flow as it destroys everything he accidently aims at the bathroom mirror a bottle of cheap cologne the bathroom window
he aims back for the toilet which is pretty much rubble now to see the floor give way
finally the pee stops and he glances down the hole
he sees his downstairs neighbor sitting at his breakfast table
he has a fork halfway to his mouth as he stares at the smashed toilet on his pancakes
hal turns the corner to see his bus pulling away from the stop
he starts running after it
whoa whoa whoa
unable to stop he slams into the back of the bus and falls back to the ground
as the bus continues on he sees an indentation of his torso right below the rear window
stunned to say the least he rises to his feet
somethings not right here
he slaps himself in the face as hard as he can
wake up hal
hal spins around to see a car barreling toward him
he goes to jump out of the way zoom he flies two stories up nails a building and comes crashing back down to the sidewalk
hal sits up disheveled and scared
lets get it together man
he closes his eyes in an attempt to will back his sanity
this is just some sort of
it will pass it will pass
he opens his eyes and looks down the street
a beautiful naked woman is coming toward him
well not too fast i hope
as she passes him and turns the corner out of his view he catches another naked woman an old disgusting one
yes fast fast
he turns away from her in horror only to see an entire block of naked people going about their business
he rubs his eyes and looks down the street again
everyone has returned to a clothed state
he relaxes a little until he looks down and notices that hes floating a foot off the ground
i think i need to go home
hals front door creaks as it slowly opens revealing master mind
he walks over to the bathroom and smiles to himself as he notices the giant hole in the floor
welcome to your second birth hal stewart
master mind continues to survey the room
he stops to look over a karate kid poster on hals living room wall
he focuses on the majestic image of pat morita teaching a young ralph macchio to kick
instruction is very important in the formative years
every hero needs a mentor a father figure to look up to
he presses his special watch causing his body to morph into perfect
hal enters grabs a bottle of vodka from atop of the fridge and takes a long pull from it
a man will usually find that if he drinks from a bottle eventually the bottle drinks from him
hal does a spit take
in the corner a darkened figure stands
who are you
i am the guide on your journey
fate has chosen you to be its champion
pat morita steps out from the shadows
hal passes out again
we are close on hals face as his eyes flutter open
he appears to be lying on the couch
he hunches up on his elbows looks around but everything is as it seems
he lays his head back down
it was a dream
man i must be losing it
a voice sounds right next to his ear
you know youre out of orange juice
hal leaps up to find hes been resting his head on pats lap
this isnt happening this isnt happening
hal backs away and trips over a box
all things must be filtered through calmness
sometimes its best to freak out
i think we must work on your attitude first
look im gonna call the cops in about two seconds if you dont get out of here
pat rises and walks to hal
hes so calm it makes hal calm
are you calm now
yeah im okay
pat slaps him across the face hard
good because weve got a lot of work to do
hal grabs his jaw
what the hell was that for
rule number one expect the unexpected
can you just tell me what this is all about
the heavens are not in the habit of bestowing a gift such as this to just anyone
you are being rewarded for being a man of great moral fortitude with an unwavering belief in humanity
thats me alright
i am to train you so you may fulfill your destiny to defeat the great menace to metro city master mind
pat gets up and walks toward the door
were are we going
pat is sitting in the drivers seat
the car is bumping up and down
strength is just as much in the mind as it is the muscle
remember both need to be exercised
we pull back to see hal lifting the car up over his head
hes hardly straining
pat leans on the horn
two highly attractive female joggers run by
theyre clearly impressed with hals show of strength
he smiles and mouths a hello
yeah work both muscles
pat cocks back the chamber of a
he holds it up and carefully takes aim
at hals chest
what are you doing
an invulnerability test
i would prefer not to get shot
do not fire that thing
frustrated pat lowers the gun
okay do you know that for sure
pat quickly aims and fires
hal lets out a high pitched scream as the bullet ricochets off his chest
i do now
hal looks down at his chest not so much as a scratch
hal is in the air flying in a sitting position
hes weaving back and forth
ice man i got a bogie on my tail
two russian migs coming in hard and fast
hal looks down to see pat morita yelling at him from the roof of a building down below
what did i tell you
stomach down hands up
hal sighs and assumes the proper superhero in flight position
god i feel so gay
pats cell phone begins to ring
he answers it
in master mind voice what is it
he looks up to make sure no one is in earshot
he sees hal now doing somersaults in the air
pat turns his attention back to the phone talking in his john cusack voice
in cusack voice yes its john cusack
hi its roxanne
i really enjoyed talking with you the other day
as did i
god i feel really silly and if you have a lot going on i totally understand
but i was wondering if you maybe wanted to have lunch
he cant believe what hes hearing
excited id love to
he quickly recovers his composure
i mean i am a little hungry
how does the park sound around noon ish
great see you then
pat hangs up the phone and returns it to his pocket as hal lands behind him
man that is so cool
its like fly oh my god i almost said it was like flying
for the rest of the day i want you to continue to practice your flying posture
why wherere ya going
to do something
mysterious and asian
say no more bro
ill just keep at it then
john cusack and roxanne eat wrapped sandwiches while walking through metro city park
hows your sandwich
its quite delicious
hope you dont think im too forward
some men are intimidated when a woman asks them out
i just find you really easy to talk to
and i you
you know youre not at all like you are in the movies
i dont know you have this strange refined way of speaking
that is most interesting
anyway when we were talking the other day i just felt even though we only talked for a couple of hours that weve known each other for years
i know just what you mean
roxanne bites into her sandwich
you know what
this sandwich is disgusting
she tosses it in a nearby garbage can
of course i already ate half of it
i wonder what that says about my character
it means you dont give up on a sandwich
you see that it has potential and you give it every chance to be all it can be
roxanne smiles at his analogy
thanks but knowing me i was probably projecting my expectations of what a lunch should be on the sandwich
it might have been okay at first but i just made it bitter
john cusack notices roxannes smile starting to fade
is that what happened with your last sandwich i mean boyfriend
when i look back i probably shouldnt of expected so much from him
he was already a giving person
you know one of those go out and save the world types
ive run into a few
i was selfish i guess
i didnt want to share him with anybody else
it sounds like he was a special man
they broke the mold
john cusack arches his eyebrow in a very familiar manner
hal walks up to pat morita sporting a lone ranger type mask and wearing a purple and red superhero costume
its not unlike ubermans except for a giant t on his chest
from here on hal is referred to as titan whats the t stand for
whats that supposed to mean
its from roman mythology
oh just go with it
you look perfect
i dont think this mask is big enough
are you sure no one is gonna recognize me
its fine just dont slouch
its all in the posture
he grabs titans shoulders like a proud papa
it is time
there is a long line of people snaked around the velvet ropes
theyre all waiting for their chance at the one open teller window
four men wearing beatles masks john paul george and ringo and carrying shotguns enter the bank
john fires a shot in the air sending everyone into an immediate panic
alright folks this is a robbery
nobody moves yadda yadda yadda
ringo jumps over the teller wall and starts stuffing bills into a bag
as john and paul cover the crowd george goes to the corner office and puts a gun to the bank managers head
okay just dont hurt anyone
yeah yeah yeah
george leads him out by the collar
crash titan smashes through the window and lands in a bold superhero stance with hands on hips
well boys theres no need for all this just to get the free toaster
paul cocks his gun
what are you suppose to be
we move in for a nice dramatic close up
well justice suck on this
george john and paul open fire on titan
he just stands there and yawns as the bullets bounce off him
with their guns empty the three just stare at him in amazement
now its my turn
he turns to george
hey george here comes the sun
titan grabs george and throws him into a fluorescent light fixture in the ceiling
paul tries to run for the door
titan snatches the collar of his jacket
say paul your mother should know
that youre a scumbag
he tosses paul out the window and into a parked delivery titan turns around just as john hits him with the butt of his shotgun
it instantly breaks apart in his hands
titan lifts him like a rag doll up into the air
john all you need is love
he throws john who lands on top of a cubical wall groin and a good urologist
titan effortlessly hops over the teller wall to find ringo cowering on the floor
he grabs him by the shirt and lifts him up
youre under arrest
titan walks out of the bank with ringo and george under his arm
hes suddenly swarmed by a group of television reporters including roxanne
across the street is pat morita
he watches titans first news conference with great anxiety
to hal on behalf of the first national bank of metro city id like to offer you a reward for your act of bravery
he hands titan a check
reading ten thousand dollars
titan looks over to pat who violently shakes his head no
cant except this
law and order is its own
pat gives him the thumbs up
pat turns suddenly seeing roxanne with her camera crew
captivated his eyes lock on her
meanwhile roxanne and her cameraman seth are maneuvering around the crowd to get closer to titan
not so fast roxanne
they both turn to see roxannes reporter rival brad helms geraldo without the class and his cameraman frank
this storys mine
we were just in the area
i was just trying to ive been in this business long enough to know pretty well what you were just trying to do
besides i heard you couldnt take the big game anymore and were put on fluff detail
dejected roxanne turns and motions for seth to turn the camera off
youre not gonna take that from him are you
old habit i guess
to brad well get out of your way
as they walk off brad makes a comment to frank loud enough for her to hear
besides im sure theres a pancake supper somewhere that needs covering
we see the news conference on the banks steps
in the corner of the screen is written recorded earlier
for months now since the death of uberman the citizens of metro city have been holding out for a hero
well it appears they wont have to hold out for much longer as a new costumed crusader has suddenly stormed onto the scene
today at the metro savings and trust a masked mystery man single handedly defeated the fab four gang
just who is this new caped avenger
brad holds the microphone to titans face
im sure all of our viewers are now wondering whats the t stand for
its a message to all the scum out there
uberman may be gone but metro city has a new protector and his name is tighten
another reporter leans in
how do you spell that
we pull back to see plato and da vinci watching this spectacle
master mind is sitting with them reading a reading paper oh for heavens sake
i cant believe it
he misspelled his name
master mind holds up the newspaper
the headline reads metros new hero tighten
no matter i suppose
master mind throws the paper on the floor and begins to pace around the room with his arms folded behind his back
weve now fully established titan as metro citys hero
they will love him just as they loved uberman
everything is going according to plan
einstein leans over and whispers in platos ear
whispering yeah if the plan is getting us in jail
master mind turns around facing einstein
he walks over standing face to face with the rebellious henchmen
you know einstein maybe i should have called you socrates
he also didnt know when to keep his thoughts to himself
i just fail to see the point in all of this
i mean why are we creating another superhero when it was such a pain in the ass for you to get rid of the other one
i mean uberman is destroyed we should be using this opportunity to
i dont know
to take over the weather space the world whatever super villains are supposed to do
the reason someone like you will always be a minion is because you have no foresight
we take over the earth like you said
even the grandest treasures will lose their lustre if you dont have someone to hold them over
einstein throws up his hands
hes had enough
he pulls off his wig and throws it to the floor
this balance of the force bullshit is getting way too oprah for me
whos with me
yeah i dare
im sick of wearing stupid costumes and im sick of working for a super villain whos turning into a softie
plato and da vincis mouths drop to the floor
they turn to master mind for his rebuttal
what did you call me
you heard me
you used to be an inhuman monster now look at you
youre creating super heroes you dont go with us on robberies anymore its been days since you threatened anyone oh and not to mention this roxanne ritchi thing
that is none of your business knave
hey you guys havent sealed the deal yet have you
in a womans voice oh master your head is so big
im warning you einstein
in a womans voice take me
i said silence
with his metal gauntlet master mind grabs einstein by the throat and lifts him into the air
einstein looks frightened as he tries to pry himself free of master minds grip
master minds eyes soften as if his heart is suddenly not into what hes about to do
he lets einstein drop to the floor
get out of my sight
roxanne and john cusack are eating on the outside patio of a fancy restaurant
dont get me wrong i love being a reporter
i dont think i could do anything else
its the consequences of what we do that im having a problem with
he listens intently as he refills her glass with wine
thats where journalistic responsibility comes in no
its supposed to
sounds to me like youre running from something
i got someone i cared about killed
if it wasnt for me he wouldnt have been involved
john suddenly gets a disturbed look in his eye realizing what shes talking about
he reaches across the table and takes her hand
you cant blame yourself
my father used to say each of us must answer the great call to truly feel alive
was he an actor
and a horrible one
i mean he would fail time and time again at his
and sometimes hed get pretty beaten up or thrown in jail jail
my point is he took the good with the bad
he grew a little each time
was he ever successful
but dont let deter you
thanks for this
you know this is embarrassing but its been a long time since i its starting to lightly sprinkle
roxanne looks up
i think its starting to rain
we might want to find a table inside
what were you gonna say
oh i was gonna say
its been a long time since
well ive been with someone i
enjoy being with
john cusack smiles warmly and raises his glass for a toast
to people who enjoy being with each other
they go to clang glasses when the rain suddenly causes john cusacks disguise generator to short
his true form of master mind is briefly revealed to roxanne as a bolt of electricity encircles his body
roxanne drops her glass and jumps out of her seat
dont look at me
like a broken tv the image keeps switching between master
as master mind starts to franticly slap at his watch the cusack disguise begins to hold steady
he nonchalantly returns to cutting his steak
okay never mind that
now where were we
roxanne grabs his glass and throws the drink in his face causing the generator to short out permanently
master mind now sits in his true blue form
oh my god
youre not gonna get all freaky about this are you
this is too much even for you
god i go out with you tell you my innermost thoughts
i only did this because i wanted to talk to you on the same level
you know without all the baggage
you burned my boyfriend alive you sick son of a bitch
you see thats exactly what im talking about
roxanne starts to walk away
stay away from me
master mind sinks back down to his chair
despite the now heavy rain bombarding him he returns to his food
several resturaunt patrons are looking at him through the window
our villain turns to them giving them a villainous glare
master mind is lying on his back wide awake
mumbling to himself stupid
what was i thinking
plato its his fault
hes the one who sent me on this weak willed path
ill filet his scrotum for this
me a creature of evil in love with roxanne ritchi
i hardly give such matters thought he rolls onto his side
he yawns and closes his eyes
suddenly they shoot back open
master mind pulls up in a blue rolls royce across the street from roxannes apartment he stares up at the building hoping to catch a glimpse of her
finally she appears primping her hair in her apartment windows reflection
i should just go up there and just lay it all out to her
roxanne i like you i always have
oh and im sorry i blew up your ex
realizing the absurdity of his words yeah that would go over like a pants less clown at a childs birthday party
what the hell am i even doing here
who cares what she thinks
im a supervillain and here i am acting like a love struck schoolboy
i control my own destiny
he turns the ignition key nothing happens
he repeats but gets the same results
she pulls a pack of smokes off her night stand
she grabs her long coat and throws it over her robe
roxanne steps outside
please be open
across the street is a liquor store
the light is still on
she walks across the street passing in front of master minds car
spotting her he sinks down in his seat
roxanne walks by totally unaware of his presence
relieved master mind sits back up and watches her go into the store
roxanne walks up to an elderly korean shopkeeper at the counter
a pack of lady strikes please
master mind is talking on his cell phone
hello triple a
he suddenly spots something across the street
a hoodlum walks up to the entrance of the store and pulls out a gun from under his coat
master mind stares in shock
ill call you back
he hangs up the phone and watches the hoodlum go inside the store
the hoodlum reaches across the counter and grabs a fist full of cash from the register
shut up gramps
he turns to roxanne spotting a gold necklace around her neck
gimme that necklace
i dont think so
the hoodlum cocks his shotgun
i said give it to me
the lady said no
the hoodlum turns around to see master mind in the doorway holding a strange looking hand cannon goo gun with knobs and blinking lights
the hoodlum starts to laugh
what the hells that
a super soaker
no its a goo gun
the hoodlum turns his gun to master mind
yeah whats it do
master mind fires the cannon
it instantly covers the store in a cloud of smoke
the smoke clears to reveal the hoodlum stuck to the wall covered in a thick green gunk
roxanne stares at him dumbfounded
master mind starts to walk out when hes suddenly confronted by the shopkeeper
i know you
you master brain guy
you a hero
master mind points the goo gun at him
dont ever say that again
master mind walks out with the cannon resting on his shoulder like hes a short timer in da nang
roxanne follows shortly behind him
master mind turns around
are you following me or something
dont flatter yourself
he turns away and continues walking
roxanne runs in front of him blocking his way
dont walk away from me when im talking to you
finally it occurs to her whats going on
what a minute
all that stuff you use to say to me when uberman was alive about me being the loyal queen by your side as you rule over metro city
that wasnt just super villain rhetoric was it
you actually meant it
my someone has a rather high opinion of themselves
they stare at each other in silence their glares locked in conflict
coldly do you really think i would be with someone like you
this stings master mind to the bone
and after a brief contemplation he reaches the only logical painful conclusion
with that master mind exits into the night leaving roxanne with a baffled expression on her face
master mind enters in a huff
da vinci closes the door behind him as plato notices his masters agitated state
everything alright sir
master mind grabs plato by the groin with his metal gauntlet causing platos eyes to bulge in pain
overly calm fine why do you ask
master mind tightens his grip
master mind releases him
just with business my minion
just with business
ive decided it is time
yes weve created our hero now its time to give him a little motivation
how do we do that
to be simply good is not enough
a hero must be driven by an almost relentless desire to right a wrong that can never be corrected
yes he must lose someone near and dear to him his father figure
gentlemen its time for operation mentor kill
titan flies high over and through the city under bridges between buildings etc
hes not really working just enjoying himself
a pretty woman sits at her makeup table wearing nothing but her bra and panties
through the reflection in her mirror we see a large window directly behind her
as she applies lipstick we see titan fly quickly by in the background
after a moment he slowly slides back in view and begins ogling the girl
she sees him in the mirror and quickly covers herself with a robe
titan tries to hide his face as he zooms off
titan looks down to see an apartment building in ruin
emergency lights flash around it as swarms of people run around in chaos
man what the hell happened down there
wait a sec he stops in mid air as he comes to the striking realization
titan lands in front of the rubble that was once his home
reporters stand just beyond the police line
from the wreckage crawls a dying pat morita
titan goes and kneels beside pat holding him in his arms
im dying kid
there is just one last lesson i have for you
it is the most important of all
master mind did this you must avenge me
because hes evil
you must stop the evil hal stop the
pats body goes limp
the cameras begin to pop and flash around them
titan gently lays pats body down and stands respectfully over him
the reporters rush over
tighten is this the work of master mind
how will the death of your mentor affect your resolve
was that pat morita
titan walks up to one of the cameras
this injustice will not go unpunished
master mind if you can hear me tighten is coming for you
in the background we see plato and da vinci dressed as paramedics load pats body onto a stretcher
plato accidentally drops his side
as he bends down to pick it back up pat quickly slaps him then goes back to playing dead
master mind and the boys prepare the fortress for hals revenge attack
master mind is as giddy as a schoolboy
alright people we dont have much time
titan should be here any minute so lets get the lead out
there is a giant mounted death ray in the middle of the hall being tinkered with by da vinci
hows the death ray coming
nearly up to full power sir
lets turn it down a few notches
its his first time and we dont want to get in a lucky shot now do we
plato enters the room
anything on the radar yet
not yet sir
well he must be planning something big
are the flame androids deployed
master mind rubs his hands in anticipation as he sits down on his throne
plato da vinci take your places next to me
they move to either side of the chair
da vinci straightens up and sucks in his gut
they remain this way for several long moments
master mind occasionally glances at a digital clock on the wall
still no titan
apparently quite some time has passed
the bold stances have degraded to fatigue
hes certainly taking his time
hell be here
thats the way it works
master mind reclines in his chair and taps his metal gauntlet impatiently on the armrest
plato has squatted down resting his chin on his hand
unprofessional thats what this is
no its disrespect for the craft
master mind rises and begins to pace back and forth
would uberman have kept us waiting like this
of course not
he was a pro who knew the score
its time we spelled out a few things for this titan
i will not be made a fool of
he storms out of the room
titans sitting on the floor in a barren apartment wearing his costume top and some tighty whities
he sips his beer as he watches a basketball game on a tiny tv
much to his annoyance theres a knock at the door
oh for crying out loud
he gets up and opens the door
its master mind
do you know who i am
it takes a few moments to register but titans suddenly excited
yeah youre master mind
youre actually the guy i want to see
oh so now you want to get down to it
well i want to get a few things off my chest first
master mind walks past titan into the apartment
he spins around pointing at him accusingly with one of his metal fingers
of all the inconsiderate do you have any idea how long we waited for you
were you even planning on coming to me and getting revenge
titan shuts the apartment door and turns back toward his guest
well at first i was going to
you know because thats what i figured i was supposed to do
but then i got to thinking interrupting you got to thinking
theres nothing to think about
im the villain
i do something bad you come and get me
i got to thinking
whats the point
master mind throws up his hands
maybe youre right
whats the point
he suddenly notices something in the corner of his eye
he walks over to a futon in the living room
on top of it is a
what are these
thats what i wanted to talk to you about
baffled where did you get all this
proudly get this i stole them
from all over
you see once you killed pat and ruined my other apartment building i was pretty pissed off so i figured id go find you and kick some ass
then i thought to myself okay then what
i mean if we were to fight what would i get out of it
would i get my apartment back
would i be able to pay the bills
well what about your mentor
tell you the truth
he was kind of a dick
i mean being a hero is dandy and all but its volunteer work
now youve always had the right take on all this
i mean when you rob a bank or take over the diamond exchange you get something out of it
i mean when you dont get caught which no offense isnt very often
and that brings me to what i wanted to propose to you who could catch you if im by your side
perplexed by his proposal master mind just stares at titan awe struck
you want to team up
you got the brains i got the brawn
we could even call ourselves that brain and brawn
look at this
titan picks up a piece of poster board off the floor and shows it to master mind
i even designed us some new costumes
the picture is crudely drawn with magic markers and crayons
a big headed man master mind is standing on a plate of grass in a blue costume with a picture of a brain on his chest
next to him is a picture of titan in a red costume with a black cape but his chest is mysteriously blank
titan proudly points to the two figures
see youd be brain so you got a little one on your costume and then ill have brawn on mine
once i figure out the best you know visual interpretation of it
what do you think
what do i think
master mind shakes his head tiredly
i think youre probably the biggest idiot ive ever met
i mean i cant believe you
all your gifts all your powers and all you want to use them for is your own financial fulfillment
you know what
your kind of people make me sick
titan puts down his drawing
i worked hard on this
oh gee i am so sorry
master mind looks to heaven in disgust
under his breath of all the people to pick it had to be this loser
this strikes a cord with titan
now hold on
youre going a little too far
i wish your mother said that to your father the night of your conception they would have saved me a whole lot of heartache
hey i mean it
master mind gets right in his face
what are you gonna do
we see master minds body crash through the building and land in a dumpster across the street
a car pulls up
the drivers door opens
da vinci gets out and runs to help his master
da vinci peeks into the dumpster to see master minds body cushioned by a stack of trash bags
the overly large henchmen starts to pull his master from the dumpster when they suddenly hear a voice from above
its titan peeking through the hole in his apartment wall
i dont need you i dont need anybody
i have the power to do and take anything i want
and now im gonna take back everything this city owes me
beware metro city its time for titan to collect
titan shoots up into the air
oh and from now on im gonna fly he takes a sitting position and flies away as if he were piloting an invisible jet
master mind climbs out of the dumpster and watches titan disappear into the distance
howd the plan go boss
i just made myself redundant old friend
da vinci gives master mind a whiff
its not that bad
titan with a happy bounce in his step enters the bank
the last time he was here he thwarted a robbery
he looks nostalgic
a security guard shyly walks up to him like a kid meeting his tv idol
is there something we can do for you
oh dont bother about me
im just here to make a withdrawal
titan walks across the lobby drawing stares of admiration from all
a little girl waves to him sweetly
he gives her a good natured wink as he heads straight for the vault
the security guard watches him enter and come out with a sack sure he must be misunderstanding whats going on the security guard just stares at titan as he passes
by and out the door
the bank manager comes over to the guard
say did he just rob us
sort of looks it dont it
should i you know stop him
as the security guard exits the bank the manager stares out the window
his eyes suddenly grow wide with terror
the guards body suddenly smashes through the window landing at the startled bank managers feet
looking down at the guard he did rob us didnt he
a channel news special report
brad helms wipes into view
absolute power corrupts absolutely
when lord acton stated that in a letter to bishop mandell creighton in no one thought much about it but today metro city is reeling from that very prophecy
tighten who many thought of as our savior has turned his back on the cause of justice
titan flies through the window of the building
he emerges seconds later laughing with his shirt full of booty
a woman screams from the window of a burning building
titan flies up to her grabs her fur coat and zooms off again leaving the woman behind slightly confused
titan steals a little boys lollipop and gooses his mother
dozens of people run through the streets apparently to get out of a downpour
we cut to the top of a building and see titan zipping up his pants and laughing
master mind paces back and forth in front of plato and da vinci
i dont understand it
he seemed to have every characteristic we were looking for in a superhero
well theres no use crying about it now we must take action
im not going to play second fiddle to that crass buffoon
we must destroy tighten
it wont be easy
uberman had a sense of decency and genuine love for the people
that was his weakness and was easily used against him
yes but he possesses the same flaws present in ubermans dna copper
its like benjamin franklin always said if something works dont dick with it
it looks like a war zone passed through here
smashed police cars and debris lay everywhere
this seems to be the only building left untouched
a very tipsy titan is sitting at the bar looking deep into the bottom of his beer glass for answers
i can have anything i want
im like a god
the bartender just listens as he wipes down a glass with a dirty rag
point to any woman in this bar
i could have her in a second
he follows the bartenders gaze to the only other person there a passed out middle aged hag of a barfly
to old barfly hey you wanna get with this
buddy what do you want
titan carefully considers this for a moment
what do you want
thats the question isnt it
i mean what do you want when you can have everything
titan contd i suppose what i really want is to never be forgotten again
i want to do something that can never be cast aside or one upped
i want a whats it called
i want a legacy
yeah thats it
i like the sound that
i meant what do you want to drink
titan stumbles out of the bar carrying a large sack of money
your time has come to an end titan
he looks up to see master mind suddenly standing before him
there can be only one master criminal in this city and its me
titan melodramatically throws up his arms
i guess i should leave town then huh
i have a better idea now
two floors up da vinci releases a rope
a copper cage like the one that caged uberman drops down on top of titan
titan nonchalantly surveys the cage
he walks to the bars tries to pull them apart but cant
thats copper my good man
your one weakness
master mind contd for all your amazing gifts of brawn you are no match for my intellect
titan thinks for a moment
suddenly he starts to spin like a human top drilling himself into the street below
as he disappears beneath the surface we see a shocked look on master minds face until titan suddenly explodes out from under the street in front of him
master mind stares up at him dumbfounded
titan makes like hes going to strike him down but stops
you know what
youre nothing but a bug
not even worth my effort
he turns his back to master mind and continues down the street
plato makes his way from the shadows to join his master
they watch titan shrink into the distance
hes not as dumb as i thought
i guess not
funny uberman didnt think of the same thing
as titan flies he looks down at the rooftops of the city below
suddenly something catches his attention
he stops hovering in place as he looks down below
the buildings which make up the heart of downtown metro are in a perfect triangle with a long strip of street leading up to it
it sorta looks like a bowling lane
vinnie and his goons come running out as the hear a they look up to see titan ripping off the giant bowling ball from the top of the establishment
hey thats my ball
roxanne enters the buildings elevator
just before the door closes an elderly woman slides in
that was a close one
sixth floor please
roxanne smiles and goes to press the button
the elderly woman suddenly pulls out a spray can shooting a mysterious looking mist into roxannes face
she falls to the floor unconscious
roxanne awakens finding herself tied to a chair in her living room
we hear noise from a tv in the background as she tries to adjust her vision
slowly the blurry figure before her becomes clear
its master mind
he sits on her lazy boy reading what looks to be some kind of journal
wow i always thought uberman was your first superhero but it looks like our little roxanne dated a linebacker in college
thats my diary
so it is
well then i wouldnt leave it in your underwear drawer for just anyone to find
he throws the diary over his shoulder
what do you want
i need your help
so you knock me out and tie me to a chair
youre not going to like what im about to tell you
as she tries to shake off her headache from being knocked unconscious roxanne spots something on the tv
brad helms is huddled behind a van
its chaos here in city square as city police behind him titan picks up a police car and throws it at a paddy wagon
both vehicles explode on impact
hes really out of control
tell me about it
as if finally realizing something roxanne looks back at master mind
i should have known
you have something to do with this dont you
with titan turning evil
well the evil thing he did by himself
my goal was to give myself purpose by creating an intellectual sparring partner
confused youre talking like you made him
and they call me master mind
let me get this straight
you missed getting your ass kicked so you made a new guy to kick your ass
roxanne turns back to the tv to see a group of police officers open fire on titan
the bullets just deflect off his chest
and his powers theyre just like ubermans
why would he have his powers
almost ashamed i had some left over from something
i infused him with it
driven by rage she struggles to tear out of her bonds
she finally relents giving master mind a look fueled by pure hatred
yeah thats why i decided to tie you up
you did all this because you wanted purpose
he seemed nice
titan is standing on top of a destroyed police car
he waves for the camera to zoom in on him
i want to show the people my real face
he pulls off his mask revealing himself as hal stewart to the public for the first time
hes the guy we thought saved that woman and kid
turned out he was just trying to save his own ass
yeah good to know now
titan throws the mask over this shoulder and hops off the car
thats right im really hal stewart
former hero and bowling teacher at kingpins bowling
roxanne turns to master mind condescending him with her eyes
you picked a bowler to give super powers to
its a modest profession
with my new found power ive recently started to wonder what sort of legacy i should leave
should i be a hero
i tried that once before even saved a lady and her baby from being squashed
i was treated like a god until everyone started to shit on me okay so what if i didnt purposely save them
he walks over and puts his hand on a large circular concrete shape just off camera
well im going to make something that cant be taken away from me
im going to create a permanent monument to my greatness
one that wont be so easily forgotten or erased
the camera pulls back revealing the giant concrete bowling ball from kingpins
i intend to create a new category in the guinness book of worlds records by rolling the biggest strike in the history of bowling
he grabs the camera and points it to the downtown buildings
we realize they are perfectly aligned in bowling pin my thanks to the city planning commission
this wouldnt have been possible without them
titan grabs the camera so its pointing back at him again
tell your friends and family to tune in right here to this station at noon tomorrow
my god hes nuts
thatll destroy the whole business triangle
master mind seems to be contemplating something something bad
my lair is in the direct path of the ball
oh real nice
wouldnt want anything to happen to your hideout would we
you dont understand
i have certain equipment thats thats highly unstable
what do you mean
i sort of have a hydrogen reactor okay
a hydrogen reactor
its experimental only one in the world
well how do you think i power all my inventions
someone like me cant pay for electricity
the bills would be outrageous
it creates times the output of a nuclear one
if destroyed it could
vaporize the entire city
the whole eastern seaboard actually
that little baby is amazing
im quite proud of it
master mind contd off her deadpan reaction i mean
wed better find a way to stop him
master mind thinks a moment
did uberman have a hideout
a cave a solitary fortress of some kind
cmon all heros have a place to hang their capes up in
roxanne it may be our only chance to find something a clue anything that could give us a fighting chance
its under his house
roxanne can hardly believe what shes telling him
master mind shoots up out of his chair
uberman was wayne scott
wayne scott the wealthy philanthropist
but he disappeared interrupting he disappeared just over two months ago when you killed him
not only did you rid the world of a hero you killed a kind noble generous man
perhaps ashamed the super villain hangs his head
master mind walks behind roxanne and undoes her bonds
rubbing her wrists she watches him as he walks over to the door
looks like you got what you always wanted
uberman is out of the picture and metro city is doomed
he grabs the door knob and stops considering her words
metro city doomed
you know i never thought id say something like this but here it goes he slowly turns to her cue heroic music
not if i have anything to say about it
master mind stands before the huge gothic structure in awe
such a dark place for one such as you
i wonder underneath your noble deeds what inner demons drove you to your endless crusade for justice
he walks to the front entrance
the double doors have been sealed shut with boards and nails
master mind begins to tear them off with his metal hand
the doors opens
a beam of moonlight immediately pierces the darkness forming an illuminated path into the heart of the manor
master mind enters
covered in dust and cobwebs the hall looks like a gigantic crypt
good lord man
youve only been dead for two months
master mind walks coming to a gigantic painted portrait of wayne scott
he stops to reverently admire the image of his fallen foe
a disguise so simple its ingenious
no wonder i never caught on
besides the armani suit theres nothing to hide the fact that this is the same person as uberman
in the picture hes even standing in the same cheesy heroic pose with his fists on his hips
two lives yet in both you were an ideal
perhaps it was you who was victorious in the end old friend
a bonging sound suddenly bellows through the dark halls
master mind comes to a grandfather clock standing next to a gigantic bookcase
on the twelfth bong it falls silent
master mind begins to slide it across the floor until he hears a loud click
the bookcase slides into the wall revealing a hidden ill miss how predictable you were
the passage way leads master mind to a working escalator
master mind gets off the escalator to see a long hallway with stone walls
he begins to hear strange sounds almost like muffled screams coming from a doorway at the end of the hallway
master mind starts walking towards it
as he steps closer he begins to notice a light cracking through the bottom of the door
all the big men who are with me now
to himself whats the worst youre gonna find
master mind contd the man was a boy scout not a serial killer
he opens the door to his immediate amazement
its some kind of screening room
a projector shoots an image onto a dirty white screen hanging on the wall
beer cans litter the floor a table in front of a ripped up couch is covered in discarded snack goods and a kiss pinball machine stands in the far corner
next to a closed door
master mind turns his attention to the action on the screen
a woman dressed in a leather dominatrix outfit is whipping an overweight man lying on a swing like device with his butt sticking out
she whips him three times
the man cries out in pain
master minds eyes are transfixed on the disturbing imagery
the door by the pinball machine suddenly swings open
wayne scott dressed in raggedy sweats steps into the room carrying a can of beer and a bowl of jiffy pop
master mind cannot believe his horrified eyes
wayne scott is just as startled
he drop his drink and snack to the floor
the two men stare at each other as they struggle to regain their normal breathing patterns
wayne scott walks over to the couch brushes off a thick layer of chip crumbs and sits down
what the hell are you doing here
i might just ask you the same question
i had thought i incinerated you
you scared the bejesus out of me
howd you figure out i was still alive
wait how do you know my identity
roxanne told me
as for your ruse i forgot to line the bottom of the copper cage somebody pointed that out to me recently
figured if they could do it so could you
but one thing i couldnt figure out the skeleton
something i borrowed from a medical school a few months before
a few months
how long had you been planning this
i always planned to retire eventually
i mean come on you cant do this sort of thing in your fifties
youd just look ridiculous
the pieces of the puzzle appear to be coming together in master minds head
i see it all so clearly now
master mind and his minions cover their eyes as the observatory explodes
you must have done it just seconds before the observatory exploded
similar to what titan did uberman bores out from under the cage
you bore out from under the cage
then using your uber speed running in a blur like haze uberman screeches to a halt in front of some bushes
you made your way to safety where you had the skeleton safely hidden away somewhere
uberman soars high above the clouds
he looks down at the observatory which is a mere speck in the distance
then you must have flown to a safe distance and waited for the explosion then
just as the observatory explodes uberman aims and throws the skeleton like a javelin
it soars through the air like a missile tearing through the flames of the explosion and crashing right into the windshield of master minds hydrofoil
wayne stares at master mind clearly impressed
man you are smart
but why fake your death
why go through all of it
you could have just quit
but the responsibility would still be there
wayne scott contd a cop can retire and stop handing out speeding tickets but people expect more from superheroes
i tell you a volcano couldnt erupt in zimbabwe without everyone expecting me to do something about it
i figured out of sight out of mind
and wayne scott
why did he have to disappear
both of my lives have so much baggage
its time for new baggage you know
master minds is absolutely flabbergasted
i just cant believe it
this whole time youve been in hiding while a force of great evil is tearing your city apart
wayne rises to his feet waving his hands for master mind to say no more
i dont want to hear about it
thats why i dont have a television in here to remind me of all the things i should be doing
hell i could get a wife to do that
theres a demented supervillain out there about to destroy our i mean your city
wayne shrugs indifferently
youre really going to do nothing
good and evil have a way of balancing themselves out
if this guy is as bad as you say somebody will rise up to fight him
its just the order of things
you found me didnt you
wayne puts a condescending hand on master minds shoulder
i know its hard but youll find someone else someday
he then starts walking to the door
youre the only one who can stop him
wayne turns around
couldnt if i wanted to
gotta a plane to catch
going to barbados for a little change in climate
now if youll excuse me i got to go pack
he reads the still defeated look on master minds face
you were a good foe
im sorry if ive let you down
if it makes a difference you were the best foe a hero could ask for
not smart enough to come up with a full proof trap
well you did almost have me when you figured out my weakness was copper
now that made me sweat a little
took me way too long to drill out from under that cage
i got lucky
anyway its a good thing for my sake that i could always count on you for an out
suddenly confused what do you mean
cmon we always threw each other a couple of bones
you would always leave me an out in one of your full proof traps and id never had you incarcerated at a penitentiary that you couldnt eventually escape from
it kept our little game going
master mind seems deflated
was that all this ever was to you
you know i was trying my best every time i fought you
those outs as you call them were unintentional
i guess i was never really a match for you was i
thoughtfully then how can i expect to be one for titan
a beaten man master mind heads for the door but stops and turns around
what about roxanne
wayne unleashes an exhausted sigh
i think we both got what we wanted out of our relationship
she got a career out of me and i got plenty of other things out of her
but im ready to move on to greener pastures
master minds steel hand clinches into a fist at his side
waynes oblivious to this
i guess i wasnt the villain i thought i was and you
you werent the hero i thought you were
he turns to make his exit when he suddenly sees roxanne wayne is almost at a loss for words
how long have you been
roxanne looks at master mind
dont you have something else you can go do
master mind leaves roxanne and wayne facing each other in silence
titan emerges with brad and frank
hes holding a beer can and a bag of pork rinds
alright i want this whole thing to look espn professional understand
a distant mechanized rumble can be heard
the noise rises signaling the approach of something powerful
titan and his crew walk out to the center of the plaza as the sound becomes almost deafening
as it moves over the street
we pull back to see a whole line of tanks rolling along the street
from the five streets branching off the plaza a dozen tanks roll toward titan
titan turns to brad and frank
you guys are about to get some good footage
i might need a little room though
brad and frank look at each other and run to take cover behind a nearby building
meanwhile titan nonchalantly sips from his beer as the tanks begin to surround them
feedback belts out of one of the tanks loudspeakers causing titan to do a mock wince
titan we have orders from the city of metro to take you into custody
if you do not give your self up willingly we will be forced to open fire
theres a long pause as no one says anything
what is your answer
titan takes a sip of his beverage and unleashes a gigantic burp the shockwave of which sends several of the tanks flying into a nearby building
two of the remaining tanks close in on the villain
both have him dead to rights at point blank range with their massive guns
titan sets down his beer then calmly plugs a fist into each barrel
the force of the blast sends them both flying in opposite directions where they crash into nearby buildings
titan bends down and pick his beet back up
to beer miss me
titan is suddenly bombarded by a massive barrage of machine gun fire
the force sends him flying into the windshield of a nearby car
he looks up to see an apache assault copter
its nose mounted gatling gun is turning toward him
titan gets up to his feet and looks down at his beer can
the bottom of it was blown apart in the blast
didnt mean to get you involved in all of this
he stared daggers up at the helicopter pilot just as the gun gets a bead on him
you killed my suds
titan throws the can up and slaps it with the palm of his hand
it flies with so much force it knocks the helicopter blade clean off
the rest of the apache crashes to the street like a car dropped off a building
thats one was for you beer
titan salutes the wreckage and walks away to find brad and frank still hiding behind the building
guys please tell me you got that last bit
youre kidding me
i give you my sexiest moves and you mean to tell me it was for nothing
we were afraid something might hit us
looks like ive given the story of the century to the wrong man
he thinks about this for a moment then it hits him
what about that other reporter
not so lumpy on the topper half but killer legs
you want roxanne
shes a much better reporter than i am
you want her
where can i find her
were actually not supposed to give out that sort of information
i believe she lives in a penthouse
youve been very helpful
he tosses brad over his shoulder like a discarded ice cream cone
in the faint distance we see him splash down in the middle of the metro city river
master mind pacing anxiously as plato and da vinci pack boxes
obviously master mind is going on the lamb
hurry we must be on our way as soon as possible
master why must we flee
i told you titan is too powerful
if hes set on destroying us theres precious little we could do about it
where are we going
to another city someplace with a shitload of superheroes to fight
well start over well go back to doing what we do best
with our tails between our legs
the old master mind would never have let this comment slip by but as we have seen hes not the same man
plato do you have a better plan
master minds cell phone rings
he turns in shame from his men and answers it
roxanne paces back and forth on the phone
what are you going to do about tighten
intercut between master mind and roxanne on phone
right now im packing later ill have a snack on the train
youre running away
in a word yes
you created this monster
i didnt create this the gods of irony did and i am eating the crow i so richly deserve
theres no time for self pity
ill make the time
roxanne cant believe what shes hearing
you can leave with us
youll be safe
im not going anywhere
will you listen to me no one can stop him
you have to try
the city needs your help
im afraid you have an inflated opinion of me
what the hells happened to you
the master mind i knew would never have run from a fight even though he knew deep in his heart that he didnt have a chance in hell of winning
it was your best quality
you need to be that man right now
heart felt i believe in you
master mind is taken aback in a good way
but he catches himself before the words swell his heart
sweet words but that man is dead
please roxanne just come with me
i guess you are a coward after all
suddenly theres a loud crash
roxanne looks up to see a huge hunk of her ceiling has been completely ripped off
titan is flying above holding the debris as casually as if it were a paper plate at a barbecue
he looks down at her and smiles
man have i got a story for you
master mind can hears titans familiar laugh from his side of the line
titan is standing in front of the bowling alley trying to decide on an appropriate pose for the occasion
what pose would be best
the corny folded arms thing
he demonstrates arching his chin proudly in the air
or maybe on the hips like this
its the classic superman pose only not as masculine
no makes me look like a flamer pirate
as titan starts to fix his hair in the window frank pretends to fix the lens on his camera as he speaks to roxanne
whispering shouldnt we be making a run for it right about now
whispering the guy can outrun bullets
i dont think either one of us is in that kind of shape
shes right frank
frank looks up stunned that titan could have possibly heard him
also got super hearing
i promise not to keep the both of you long but youll thank me when this is all over
frank and roxanne exchange helpless expressions
master mind reverently stares up at the painted portrait of his father
dad its me
he looks around to make sure no one can hear bubsy
i know we havent talked in a while and im sorry
its been a little crazy trying to live up to a legacy
the paintings menacing stare seems to reach into his very soul
you raised me to be the worst that i could possibly be
and ive tried to live up to that as best as i could even dropping out of dentistry school like you wanted me to
but im about to do something now that would really piss you off
im going to go against everything you ever taught me
i hope that maybe youll look down at what im about to do as not so much a good deed but more like the outright defiance of a hateful and
if you could do that then maybe in your own little way you could for probably the first time find a reason to be proud of me
he looks back up at the picture
is it our imagination or does the paintings stare suddenly seem even angrier
either way youre probably going to see me real soon
calling over his shoulder men
plato and da vinci suddenly stop what theyre doing and look up at him
our work is not finished here
a news report shows an aerial shot of titan setting the giant ball down in the middle of a vacant city street
we interrupt your regular afternoon programming to show you live footage of a potential dangerous situation in downtown metro
the former hero knows as titan is placing what appears to be a giant ball
da vinci stops in front of a television set seeing the news report in progress
it appears our own roxanne ritchi is somehow at the scene
we now go to her with a live report
sir i think you should see this
roxanne is standing in front of a camera with a mike in her hand
im here with the cause of the destruction in metro city
he has kidnapped me and a cameraman to chronicle what he refers to as the creation of a monument to his invincibility and overall asskickiness
he will use this giant concrete bowling ball to play the largest game of bowling ever using the buildings of downtown metro city as his pins
titan suddenly steps into the shot
and im going for the biggest strike ever
he leans into the camera
and you metro city have a ringside seat as i cement my name in the anal of history
titan holds up the massive bowling ball lining up his shot
in quiet professional bowler announcer voice like tiger before him a young savior has come to raise a sport from the ashes
rookie hal stewart a young man with a dream realizing that dream here today folks
titan contd one might click there heels and say theres no place like home upon finding themselves in such a fantasy
well hal looks very much at home right were he is with a ball in hand and glory in his sights
in the bowels of master minds hideout the hydrogen reactor glows and hums menacingly
roxanne just stand helpless as frank films away
hal i know everyone treated you like shit but you dont have to do this
i dont have to do anything
isnt that cool
titan lines up his shot
heres one for the record books
titan flies a few feet and rolls the ball down the main street
her face is utter horror as she watches the inevitable destruction of metro city
as the ball rolls it demolishes everything in its wake cars street lamps windows shatter as the giant concrete sphere brushes along side buildings
he smiles in anticipation and uses body english to direct the ball
its nearly halfway to its target
she closes her eyes
titans smile fades
he looks around as if he hears something we dont
about two hundred feet in front of the first building a giant spider web flies across the path of the ball creating a defensive barrier
an enormous letter m is etched in the webs center
the ball breaks through the web but its speed is greatly reduced
look whats that flying in the air
we suddenly see master mind flying over the rolling ball in a he quickly pulls out his goo gun and starts laying down a path of sticky plasm to stop
the destructive spheres path
cmon slow down master mind looks down to see the meter of the gun close to empty
the ball slows drastically then starts rolling to the side
it heads off an embankment and rolls harmlessly into a canal
hes furious to say the least
master mind gives him a mocking grin
what other trailer park sports can you play
you are becoming a real pain in my ass
i should have done this a long time ago
titan lunges at his tormentor
master mind hits the booster on his jet pack and heads back toward the other side of the city with titan in hot pursuit
into walkie talkie plato da vinci
secure roxanne hes falling for it
a flustered titan lands
he begins searching the city streets but master mind is nowhere in sight
he turns upon hearing an eeking sound to his left
sitting on the ground is a chimpanzee wearing a strange collar
it smiles at him
what the hell
from behind titan is immediately set upon by five more radio the critters bite hop and hit titan
as soon as he throws one off two more jump him
titan breaks free and with his mighty breath blows them across the street into a fruit stand
with titan out of their sight they begin to attack the fruit
hes a block away frantically hitting his remote
stupid monkeys and their fruit
titan flies away from the mad monkeys and lands to find master mind sitting on the ground wrapped in a long cape with only his head sticking out
no more games
titan fires his laser vision at master minds chest
master mind pulls the cloak away to reveal a fire hydrant
titans eye lasers burn through the hydrant releasing a high pressure stream of water
master mind uses the last remote which dumps two tons of cement mix into the truck
the crowd police and news crews move in closer when titan doesnt emerge
master mind drops his last remote and walks toward the truck cautiously
could it really be that easy boom the back of the truck explodes throwing dust and concrete everywhere
when the dust clears we see and enraged titan
didnt think so
as the villain walks toward him he pulls back his fist to give master mind the killing blow
if you dont mind im going to punch trough your face now
preparing himself for the end master mind shuts his eyes as a sudden gust of wind begins to pick up
as titan goes to strike a blurry figure runs in and snatches stunned master mind begins to feel around his body as if to make sure everythings still in place
he turns to see uberman standing next to him
the terrified bystanders start to notice the figure standing next to master mind
as the crowd cheers a confused master mind turns to metro citys newly resurrected champion
so did i
he puts a hand on master minds shoulder
thank you old enemy
showing me the error of my ways showing me im meant to be this citys savior showing me that while we can try there is no running away from our
with that uberman is stricken by a laser blast instantly master mind turns to see titan smiling with his still smoking oh
did i interrupt something
master mind turns to run but suddenly titan is before him
where you going buddy
titan grabs master mind by the collar and throws him across the street into a parked car
welcome to paintown
master mind manages to stand on shaky legs
he seems in a daze unable to move
titan flies up in the air
time to finish this
with his fist front and center titan speeds toward master mind
hes like a human torpedo coming in for the killing blow
master mind comes to his senses and puts up his hands
titan screeches to a halt and stops just in front of him like an old warner bros cartoon
quick joke whats the capital of thailand
huh i dont know
its bang cock
in a sudden surge of strength master mind punches titan in the once mighty man instantly drops to his knees searching with tears in his eyes for the proper word
to express the pain suddenly surging through his member
baffled he looks up at master minds hand and sees his gauntlet is now made entirely out of copper
so i guess pennies are good for something
he punches titan in the face knocking him out cold
master mind looks down on titan with more than a little pride
suddenly he hears something behind him
he spins to see the crowd making a strange noise applause
roxanne comes up to him
the crowd starts to go wild and cheers for master mind
hes not sure what to make of it
pretty strange huh
theyre cheering for me
you saved them
you saved everybody
hows it feel
master mind looks at the smiles all around him
he begins to well up a little
its nice you know
i usually dont get a lot of feedback
whispering but i also kind of caused all this
what happens when they find that out i was the cause of some of this
roxanne looks at the cheering crowd then back at master mind
what they dont know wont hurt them
i guess that is all in the past
youre the hero

she kisses him
the crowd erupts in a cheer
the channel he channel logo zooms in followed by the title eye on metro city
a picture of master mind smiling appears on the screen behind her
well not master mind
it seems the former villain has done a career after defeating tighten and saving metro city from certain enslavement
and here he is getting a full pardon by metro citys mayor steve dent
cut to ceremony on capital steps
the mayor is shaking master minds metal gauntlet when it suddenly starts to crush his ahhh
secret service men quickly start to draw their weapons and take aim at master mind
realizing whats happening he quickly lets the mayors hand go and puts his arms in the air
sorry metal hand
force of habit
he elbows the mayor
were okay right
wincing the mayor signals the men to put their guns down
we cut to video of titan behind bars in a regular prison
and what about tighten
is there a prison in existence that can hold this super powered menace
well the answer we found is no
a man in a white lab coat stands in front of titans cell just out of reach
of course normally he could break out of there anytime but as you can see weve taken some special precautions
the news camera pans over see titan in his cell wearing a copper jock strap with electrical cables hooked to it
back to samantha at the desk
what is a hero
it seems never has that question needed to be asked more than it does tonight
we go to our very own roxanne ritchi making her triumphant return to our news desk for the answer
the camera pans over to roxanne who we now see has been sitting beside him
what is a hero
well there are many different kinds
there are those who hear a call like the policeman or doctor then theres the kind the public creates in their search for meaning and hope
then there are those who have the courage to change
a woman is being chased by two large thugs
theyre gaining on her
she comes to a brick wall a dead end
the thugs laugh
hey gimme that purse
i dont think it would go with your outfit
the thugs turn around to see master mind standing with his arms folded across his chest
its master mind
thug draws a knife
its not like he has any superpowers
thug puts his fingers to his mouth and whistles
suddenly two more thugs appear behind master mind
im gonna give you a chance to surrender
four against one
for a master mind youre really bad at math
master mind throws a hand signal up in the air
suddenly a giant robotic foot crashes down on the two men behind him
thug and thug drop their knives and raise their hands in the air
master mind looks up and waves
way to take out those two goons guys
we see da vinci and plato at the wheel of a gigantic robot
what two goons
the giant robot lifts its foot to check the bottom of its sole
it knocks over water tower in the process
the woman looks at master mind horrified
apologetically sorry were new at this
