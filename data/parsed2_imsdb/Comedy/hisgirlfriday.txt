screenplay by charles lederer based on the play the front page by ben hecht and charles macarthur two telephone operators sit at switchboard busy plugging in and out answering calls
this is the morning post
the city room

plugs in call morning post
just a moment plugs in call camera pulls back to disclose the rest of the anteroom
to camera left are the elevators at back wall directly behind switchboard are chairs and a table for visitors
next to switchboard are stairs leading downward to the next floor
a waist high iron grill with a gate in it separates the switchboard from the anteroom a similar grill separating it again from the city room which stretches on beyond
at a table in the switchboard enclosure sits an office boy about fifteen doing a crossword puzzle
the big clock on the back wall shows that it is nearly one oclock
as he bends over paper
we catch a glimpse of the squares of a crossword puzzle
as a reporter comes out of the city room clanging gate to behind him
the office boy looks up
whats a seven letter word for
dont ask me
if i knew any seven letter words id be something better than a reporter
he catches a glimpse of the far elevator going down
as reporter runs in to the closed elevator door and pounds on it
it comes back the door opens and he gets in
the door closes as elevator goes down
the near elevator comes up and discharges hildy johnson and bruce baldwin
bruce carries an umbrella and wears a raincoat
office boy looking over his puzzle as hildy and bruce come into the scene
with a smile hello skinny
looks up then a glowing smile hildy johnson
hildy approaches the switchboard
to operator hello maisie
the first operator looks up

he is and in a very bad humor
i think somebody stole one of his crown jewels

hildy turns to bruce
i wont be more than ten minutes i promise you
even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you
we hear a giggle off scene
he looks towards bruce and hildy and giggles

bruce embarrassed looks at the office boy then looks back at hildy as they turn toward second gate leading into city room
i said uh i said even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you

i heard it but i just wanted to hear it again
i can stand being spoiled a little

i suppose youre right but if it gets rough remember im here
ill come a running pardner
she starts to push open the iron grilled gate leading into the city room
bruce quickly springs forward and opens it for her
she kisses his cheek and walks through
he looks after her
the office boy whistles
bruce pays no attention but stares after hildy
hildy starts to walk through city room
as she walks the length of the city room
its a long walk because its a room that takes up practically the whole floor
the scene is a busy one
but gradually as hildy starts down one after another recognize her
there are cries of hildy
hello hildy etc
from the men as hildy goes straight down the aisle
she never stops but waves her own greetings jim
hi good looking
laura hullo pop nan
hello mac pete
and gets responses from each of them
one man is bent over his desk reading his copy he is standing up
hildy slaps him as she goes by
he turns around say who did that
as he sees hildy hello hildy
hildy hi jake
she passes a middle aged woman almost an edna may oliver type seated at a desk pounding out copy and smoking a cigarette
as hildy comes up to her she slaps the woman on the back
hows advice to the lovelorn
looking up hildy
ill be a monkeys uncle
what are you doing here
point of information what does a girl say on meeting her divorced husband
or what does a girl do etc
illustrating my advice is duck and cross with your right
hildy moves on
camera trucks with her to the end of the room where she pauses before the frosted glass partition which separates walter burns office from the rest of the city room
as she opens the door
burns is shaving with an electric razor and louie is holding the mirror up in front of him
shaving louie holding the mirror
a little more round the chin boss
there is a sound of the door closing and burns without looking up says what do you want
why im surprised mr
thats no way to talk to your wife even if shes no longer your wife
grinning hello hildy
to louie hi louie hows the slotmachine king
oh i aint doing that any more
im one of you fellas now a newspaper man
get going louie
i got company
the door flies open and duffy comes busting in
im busy duffy
well youre not too busy to know that the governor hasnt signed that reprieve
and that means earl williams dies tomorrow morning and makes a sucker out of us
hes on my phone
he just called me
they cant do that to me
he grabs the phone on his desk give me that call on duffys wire
wheres the governor
what do you mean you cant locate him
apparently pleading to the one man in the world who can help him mac you know what this means
were the only paper in town defending earl williams and if he hangs tomorrow were washed up
find the governor and when you find him tell him we want that reprieve
tell him i elected him and i can have him impeached
sure you can do it mac i know you can
i always said you were the greatest reporter in the country and now you can prove it
he hangs up
to duffy sarcastically the greatest reporter in the country
first i gotta tell him what news to get
gotta tell him how to get it then i gotta write it for him afterward
now if you were a decent city editor with louie and hildy in the b
dont blame me
im city editor in name only
you do all the hiring around here
well i do the firing too
remember that duffy and keep a civil tongue in your head
i dont like to interfere with business but would you boys pardon us while we have a little heart to heart talk
together well but i gotta they look at burns
scram you guys
they start to go
you wont miss anything
youll probably be able to hear him just as well outside as here
mind if i sit down
going out of the door
they cast an interested look back and linger a second
over scene comes burns voice
i said scram
they close the door hurriedly
may i have a cigarette please
burns reaches into his pocket extracts a cigarette and tosses it on the desk
hildy reaches for it
burns delves into pockets again comes up with matchbox tosses it to hildy who catches it deftly and strikes the match
how long is it
hildy finishes lighting her cigarette takes a puff and fans out the match
how long is what
you know what
how long since weve seen each other
i was in reno six weeks then bermuda
oh about four months i guess
seems like yesterday to me
slyly maybe it was yesterday
been seeing me in your dreams
casually no mama doesnt dream about you any more walter
you wouldnt know the old girl now
with conviction oh yes i would
id know you any time he grows lyrical and rising from his seat is about to start toward her as he continues together any place anywhere he sits
half pityingly youre repeating yourself
thats the speech you made the night you proposed
she burlesques his fervor any time any place anywhere
growling i notice you still remember it
ill always remember it
if i hadnt remembered it i wouldnt have divorced you
you know hildy i sort of wish you hadnt done it
it sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself
it almost gives him a feeling he wasnt wanted
look walter thats what divorces are for
youve got the old fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever till death us do part
why a divorce doesnt mean anything today
its only a few words mumbled over you by a judge
weve got something between us nothing can change
i suppose thats true in a way
i am fond of you walter
i often wish you werent such a stinker
now thats a nice thing to say
well why did you promise me you wouldnt fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works
well i meant to let you go but you know you never miss the water till the well runs dry
a fellow your age hiring an airplane to write she gestures above to indicate sky writing hildy dont be hasty remember my dimple
it held things up twenty minutes while the judge ran out to watch it
well i dont want to brag but ive still got the dimple and in the same place i just acted like any husband who doesnt want to see his home
dont you remember the home i promised you
oh yes we were to have it right after our honeymoon honeymoon
was it my fault
did i know that coal mine was going to have another cave in
i meant to be with you on our honeymoon hildy honest i did
all i know is that instead of two weeks in atlantic city with my bridegroom i spent two weeks in a coal mine with john kruptzky age sixty three getting
food and air out of a tube
you dont deny that
im proud of it
we beat the whole country on that story
well suppose we did
that isnt what i got married for
whats the good of look walter i came up here to tell you that youll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day sending twenty telegrams all the
rest of it because im lets not fight hildy
tell you what
you come back to work on the paper and if we find we cant get along in a friendly way well get married again
i havent any hard feelings
walter youre wonderful in a loathesome sort of way
now would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what i came up here for
rising reaching for his hat sure come on
well have some lunch and you can tell me everything
also rising i have a lunch date
i just want you can break it cant you
no i cant
sure you can
dont tell me what to do
were divorced im a free woman
youre not my husband and youre not my boss
and whats more youre not going to be my boss
what do you mean by that
just what i said
thats what i you mean youre not coming back to work here
thats the first time youve been right today
thats what i still interrupting youve had a better offer eh
you bet ive got a better offer
well go on and take it
work for somebody else
thats the gratitude i get for i know walter but i ignoring her what were you when you came here five years ago
a little college girl from a school of journalism
i took a little doll faced mugg you wouldnt have taken me if i hadnt been doll faced
why should i
i thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering
listen walter going right on i made a great reporter out of you hildy but you wont be half as good on any other paper and you know it
you need me and i need you and the paper needs both of us
well the paperll have to learn to do without me
and so will you
it just didnt work out walter
it would have worked if youd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter
you had to marry me and spoil everything
indignantly i wasnt satisfied
i suppose i proposed to you
well you practically did
making goo goo eyes at me for two years till i broke down
and i still claim i was tight the night i proposed
if youd been a gentleman youd have forgotten all about it
but not you
speechless you you she grabs something and chucks it at him
the phone rings
to hildy youre losing your eye
you used to be able to pitch better than that
he reaches for phone hello
well what can i do for you
seated at his desk talking into phone
whats the matter with you
are you drunk
this is duffy not sweeney
burns into phone sweeney
you cant do that to me
not today of all days
oh no sweeney
well i suppose so
if you have to you have to
he hangs up how do you like that
everything happens to me with days in the year this has to be the day
whats the matter
might just as well be
the only man on the paper who can write and his wife picks this morning to have a baby
she laughs well after all he didnt do it on purpose did he
i dont care whether he did or not
hes supposed to be covering the earl williams case and there he is waiting at the hospital
is there no sense of honor left in this country
practically well havent you got anybody else
theres nobody else on the paper who can write
thisll break me unless he stares at hildy then a light breaks hildy
youve got to help me hildy
keep away itll bring us together again hildy just the way we used to be
thats what im afraid of
any time any place anywhere
dont mock hildy this is bigger than anything thats happened to us
dont do it for me
do it for the paper
get away svengali
if you wont do it for love how about money
forget the other offer and ill raise you twenty five bucks a week
listen you bumble headed baboon all right thirty five and not a cent more
will you just great grief
whats that other paper going to give you
im not working for any other paper
in that case the raise is off and you go back to your old salary and like it
trying to blackjack look at this
pulling her glove off her left hand she gets glove off left hand and holds up an engagement ring for him to see
do you see this
do you know what an engagement ring is
he looks at ring swallows then burns and hildy
i tried to tell you right away but you started reminiscing
im getting married walter and also getting as far away from the newspaper business as i can get
himself again get married all you want to hildy but you cant quit the newspaper business
you cant sell me that walter
who says i cant
youre a newspaper man
thats why im quitting
i want to go some place where i can be a woman
i know you hildy and i know what it would mean
it would kill you
bitterly a journalist
peeking through keyholes running after fire engines waking people up in the middle of the night to ask them if they think hitlers going to start a war stealing pictures
off old ladies of their daughters that got chased by apemen
i know all about reporters a lot of daffy buttinskies going around without a nickel in their pockets and for what
so a million hired girls and motormens wives will know whats going on
no walter im through
whered you meet this man
not what youd call rich
makes about five thousand a year
whats his line
hes in the insurance business
looks up the insurance business
on the defensive its a good honest business isnt it
oh sure its honest
but somehow i cant picture you with a guy who sells policies
well i can and i love it
he forgets the office when hes with me
he doesnt treat me like an errand boy he treats me like a woman
he does does he
how did i treat you like a water buffalo
i dont know about water buffaloes but i know about him
hes kind and sweet and considerate
he wants a home and children
say sounds more like a guy i ought to marry
whats his name
well ill give you a hint
by tomorrow theyll be calling me mrs
as quick as that
the quicker the better
well i finally got out what i came in to tell you
she extends her hand so long walter and better luck next time
taking her hand i wish you everything i couldnt give you hildy
too bad i couldnt see this guy first
im pretty particular about whom my wife marries
laughing well hes waiting in the anteroom for me now
say could i meet him
oh better not walter
wouldnt do any good
youre not afraid are you
i should say not
all right then come on and lets see this paragon
gets hat is he as good as you say
burns has his hat
they start toward the door
then what does he want with you
laughing now you got me
i was just asking
at the door burns walks ahead opens door and walks out
after all he stops as he realizes shes not there
the door opens
hildy comes out
you wouldnt believe this walter but bruce holds the door open for me
incredulous no kidding
they stop as hildy and burns enter scene
as hildy follows burns through the city room
this time in contrast to hildys original walk through the room the groups are silent as they watch the two
trying to keep pace and he takes his hat off when hes with a lady
over his shoulder what for
shouting and when he walks with a lady he waits for her
stops oh im sorry
burns at this point has reached the switchboard
he says under his breath to maisie under his breath have duffy call me in the restaurant in twenty minutes
hildy a little out of breath catches up with him
at the iron gate that opens into anteroom hildy jumps ahead opens the gate and holds it for burns
walking right through thanks
hildy follows him out
as hildy follows burns in
bruce is sitting on the bench
on the end of a bench sits an old grizzled western union boy
ignoring bruce burns strides over to the boy seizes his hand shakes it and says i can see right away my wife picked out the right husband for herself
hildy behind him
bruce registers amazement at this
the messenger is more amazed than bruce as burns keeps pumping his hand vigorously
there must be some mistake
im already married
you never saw a more surprised man already married
turning to hildy o
hildy why didnt you tell me
she shakes her head at burns antics but cant help smiling nevertheless
again seizing messengers hand congratulations again mr
but my name as he enters scene mr
burns turns slightly but doesnt release messengers hand
youll have to excuse me im busy with mr
bruce baldwin here
just leave your card with the boy
bruce takes hold of burns coat and shakes it to get his attention
burns turns on him im very sorry but im busy
look he points o
theres the boy
take your card and leave it with him
he turns away again
bruce determinedly takes hold of his sleeve and pulls at it
burns wheeling around ive just told you i was busy with mr
im bruce baldwin
burns still pumping the dazed messengers hand stops at this drops hand and turns to bruce youre bruce baldwin
accusing to messenger then who are you
falteringly my names pete davis
davis this is no concern of yours and after this ill thank you to keep out of my affairs
the messenger isnt quite sure what hes done but he slinks back to his seat as burns turns to bruce
she is beginning to get sore but reluctantly again she is compelled to smile at walters behavior
reaches for bruces hand but grabs the umbrella and begins shaking the handle up and down this is a pleasure mr
baldwin and im sorry about the mistake
he tries to shift the umbrella calling burns attention to it and offers his hand instead oh i thought there was something funny
you see bruce you dont mind if i call you bruce do you
after all were practically related completely unnerved by this time and you cant quite blame him mr
well no no not at all
you see my wife i mean your wife that is i mean hildy had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man
this is the final crusher oh
but i see she didnt mean old in years
you always carry an umbrella bruce
well er it looked a little cloudy this morning
rubbers too i hope
a man ought to be prepared for any emergency
burns looks down
bruce in unconscious responses helplessly lifts his foot up and we see the rubber
taking bruces arm and leading him toward elevator come on bruce
going along but worried where are we going
where are we going
im going to buy you two lunch didnt hildy tell you
a helpless look back at hildy no she didnt
just wanted to surprise you i guess
as the elevator is about to pass he calls down
practically shoving bruce in after you bruce
as bruce disappears inside he turns toward hildy come on hildy my treat
we dont see the passengers
hildy comes into scene
i suppose i cant call this off without creating a scene but remember its your last fling
hurt how do you like that
here i am being nice to you and your sweet heart and thats the thanks i get
he jumps into the elevator in a second he hops out
very sweetly he almost sings it oh after you hildy
with a look of disgust hildy gets in
burns follows and the door slams on them
he looks after departed elevator and whistles
then he grins all over
dont tell me its you hildy
camera pulls back and discloses our three at a restaurant table
nothing swanky a place like jack blakes in new york say
beaming at waiter nobody else
she extends her hand
the waiter takes it they shake
hows everything gus
i cant complain
studying menu well i can
roast beef sandwich rare
and some coffee
shall i put a little rum in the coffee
its a nasty day
how about you hildy
discarding menu oh ill take the same i guess
little rum in yours too
i guess so
bruce looks at her
she hurriedly changes her mind
no just coffee gus
crestfallen just coffee
to bruce and you sir
putting menu down oh ill take the same i guess
and a glass of milk
thinks he hasnt heard yes
shaking his head as he writes it down milk
and dont put any rum in it gus
gus gives him a look and goes
burns surveys the others quizzically
a sigh well so youre getting married tomorrow eh
how does it feel bruce
feels awful good
yes sir were taking the four oclock train to albany and tomorrow well be married
its the puritan in him taking the train today and being married tomorrow
rising to the bait oh it isnt like that
grundy it will be perfectly all right walter
mother is coming with us on the train
but your mother no
he gets it and underlines it oh
your mother well of course that relieves my mind
to bruce isnt it sweet of walter still wanting to protect me
she gives burns that too sweet look
apparently taking this at face value i know i wasnt a good husband hildy but you can always count on me
a little cookily i dont think shell need you very much i aim to do most of the protecting myself
he pats hildys arm she smiles at him
well ill tell you one thing old man she never looked at me the way shes looking at you
i might have walter but you were never there
anyway im glad you two are going to be happy and have all the things i couldnt give her
you know hildy is about the best reporter in the country and that goes regardless of sex
but all she really ever wanted was a home
well ill try to give her one
i know you will bruce
are you going to live with your mother
just for the first year
sighing thatll be nice
a home with mother
a real honeymoon
in albany too
that ow is sotto voce but its the direct result of a kick under the table from hildy
mighty nice little town albany
theyve got the state capitol there you know
yes i know
he chuckles hildy will you ever forget the night you brought the governor back to your hotel room and found me taking a bath
she didnt even know i was in town
his laugh stops cold and he clutches for his shin again
hildy just looks
providentially the waiter enters the scene
well here we are
he begins serving them
trying to pick up again after a second hows business bruce
well albanys a mighty good insurance town
most people there take it out pretty early in life
i dont blame them
gus who has just managed to come between hildy and burns lets out a startled ouch
oh im sorry gus
my foot must have slipped
a pained expression belies his words thats all right
i sometimes wish id taken out insurance but of course now it doesnt matter
still i suppose it would have been the smart thing to do
well i honestly feel that way
i figure im in one line of business that really helps people
of course we dont help you much when youre alive but afterward thats what counts
i see what you mean
they fall to
she sips her coffee and acts surprised
gus this winking good coffee isnt it
she smiles and winks back and takes another sip
gus starts to go
youve forgotten my milk
he leaves scene shaking his head
burns sips his coffee
he likes it
he lifts his cup to hildy
heres luck to the bride and bridegroom
lifts cup thank you
looking for something to respond with apologetically he hasnt brought my milk yet
a bus boy comes into scene and stops before burns
they want you on the phone mr
boy goes burns rises starts off comes back for his cup of coffee which he then takes off with him
looking after him you know hildy hes not a bad fellow
looking at him maternally youre so nice bruce you think everybody else is
oh hes not the man for you
i can see that
but i sort of like him
got a lot of charm
he comes by it naturally
his grandfather was a snake
shaking his head if anybody had told me id be sitting at lunch with him but he swept me right off my feet
thats what he did to me
swept me right off my feet and left me lying on the floor
burns is listening has coffee on ledge and sips it now and then
get this get sweeney off that yarn and out of town on a two weeks vacation and right away
all right duffy keep your shirt on
hildys coming back
she doesnt know it yet
but shell be there
i promise you duffy
and tell louie to stick around
he hangs up smiles and finishes the coffee
then he girds himself for being crushed
he gradually begins to look sunk
he pulls out a small mirror to study his expression till he finally gets what he wants
he holds that expression as he comes out of the booth
gus is entering the scene
your milk sir
he serves bruce
and i brought you another cup of coffee hildy
gus serves her and puts still another cup in front of burns chair
she takes a sip and almost chokes
gasping for breath no
quickly but i like it that way
gus goes smiling
looking off say whats happened to burns
he looks sunk doesnt he
beaming he certainly hic does
burns comes into scene looking like a banker just before jumping off a roof and sits down
anything the matter
just sweeney again
one of my best reporters
his wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord
they cant even find him
he sips his coffee i tell you drink is the ruin of this nation
sipping hers you said it
so sweeney gets twins and earl williams gets hanged tomorrow
just what is the lowdown on williams
a poor little dope who lost his job went berserk and shot a cop who was coming after him to quiet him down
if hes nuts why doesnt the state just put him away
because it happened to be a colored policeman
for bruces benefit the colored vote happens to be very important to the mayor of this town
especially with an election coming up in a few days
are you sure williams is not all there
all youve got to do is talk to him
but the mayor would hang his own grandmother to be re elected
but couldnt you show the man wasnt responsible
theres a sly expression on his face how
you could run an interview that would prove it
remember the interview i wrote with jimmy wellman
that saved his life
slapping hands together yes you could do it hildy
you could save that poor devils life
you could but the enthusiasm dies away youre going away
how long would the interview take
oh an hour for the interview
another hour to write it
we could take the six oclock train hildy
if it would save a mans life
no bruce dear
dont you see
this is a trick to get your sympathy
no walter ive been waiting for something like this but i wasnt sure when youd spring it
if you want to save earl williams life you can interview him yourself
youre still a good reporter
bruce and i will be on that four oclock train and thanks just the same
im an editor
i know what ought to be written but i cant write it the way you could
it needs a womans heart why walter youre getting poetic
to bruce you see what i had to put up with
she never trusted me
you argue with her otherwise youre going on a honeymoon with blood on your hands
how can you have any happiness after that
all through the years youll remember that a man went to the gallows because you were too selfish to wait two hours
i tell you earl williams face will come between you on the train tonight and at the preachers tomorrow and all the rest of your lives
breaking into applause what a performance
dont let him fool you bruce its only an act
what do you mean only an act
havent you got any feeling
well its either an act on your part or a miracle on sweeneys
what do you mean
i happen to know sweeney was married only three months ago
if hes got twins this morning i claim it was done with mirrors
laughs throws up his hands all right hildy im licked
but ill make you and bruce a business proposition
were not interested
to bruce maybe youll be
youre a smart young man
you let hildy do this story for me and you can write out a
insurance policy for me
what do you say
i dont use my wife for business purposes mr
wait a minute bruce
whats commission on a
well at his age twenty payment life a little over a thousand dollars
and whats the matter with a thousand dollars
but according to the budget we laid out thats more than our food bill for a whole year
listen bruce i dont want walter burns to use me but im perfectly willing to use him
how long will it take to get him examined
i could get a company doctor in twenty minutes
now youre talking
turning on burns you keep out of this
bruce suppose you examine mr
burns in his office
ill get my bag and go over to the press room in the criminal courts building
you phone me as soon as mr
burns has given you his check
then ill go get the interview and you phone mother that were taking the six oclock train
back to burns and no tricks walter
what tricks would i pull
of course you might cancel the check
wait a minute
what would be his first payment on that policy
about twenty five hundred dollars
better make that a certified check walter
indignantly what do you think i am a crook
yes and thats putting it mildly
no certified check no story get me
the check will be certified
want my fingerprints
rising no thanks ive still got those
well ill step into some working clothes and hop over to the press room for the background on this yarn
itll be kind of fun to see the boys again too
remember bruce it must be certified
all right dear
wait a minute bruce
have you got that money
feeling his pocket the five hundred
on second thought would you let me have it
ill get the tickets
but believe me bruce i know what im doing
hed get you in a crap game but i dont gamble hilda
i know a lot of men who didnt do anything till they met walter burns
reluctantly all right
he pulls out his wallet one two three four five
be careful honey
ill be careful darling
you be please
she kisses him kisses her hand and pats it to burns cheek
so long husbands
she weaves just a bit
they look after her
smiling a little i never knew hildy to be so determined before
you havent seen anything yet
bruce turns to look at burns they look at each other
it is ringing
a hand comes in to take the phone
camera draws back a little to show endicott taking the phone
he has an eye shade over his eyes and five cards in his other hand
into phone criminal courts press room
this is endicott
no nothing new on the williams case yet boss
well you bet im here plugging away every minute
hangs up and studies his cards up a dime
camera pans slowly to reveal the other players as they speak
playing are reporters murphy endicott wilson schwartz and mccue
dropping his cards by me
also dropping droparoo
schwartz knocks on table and drops cards
reluctantly ill call
is that any good
it sure looks good from here
the boys all look up toward sound of hildys voice
framed in the doorway
she is carrying a bag and has changed her costume to a tailored travelling suit
she grins and comes into the room
they are all talking at once as hildy comes into the scene
there are ad libs of hildy
whered you come from
holy mackeral hildy johnson
hildy raises her hand for silence
one at a time boys
she enters to a desk places her bag on top of the desk takes her hat off and hangs it on a clothes tree in the corner comes back to
desk and opens the travelling bag
all through the above action she is talking rapidly
no im not back for good
im just covering the earl williams story for mr
sweeney who had a sudden attack of something but will be all right by tomorrow
no i havent made up with walter burns far from it
as a matter of fact im leaving tonight for albany and ill be married tomorrow morning
the lucky man is mr
bruce baldwin a gentleman in the insurance business and when i say gentleman i mean gentleman
are there any other questions
hildy takes notebook and pencil out of bag looks at the stockings she is wearing sees she has a run and takes a fresh pair out of the bag
she sits down and begins to put on the new stockings
grinning well that about covers everything
now i want to ask you fellows a couple of questions
did earl williams know what he was doing when he fired that gun
if you ask us no
if you ask the state alienists the answer is yes
its a simple story
earl williams works for the e
mcclosky manufacturing company as a bookkeeper for fourteen years
he starts in at twenty dollars a week and gradually works his way up to twenty two fifty
a year ago the mcclosky company goes out of business and williams loses his job
waving his hand toward wilson take it away fred wilson
well williams goes a little balmy and begins making speeches on a plan hes got to save the world
only he makes his speeches usually on a very busy street and neglects to get a license for it
well the cops let him alone as much as they can because hes harmless and theyre kinda sorry for him
but one day he decides to hold a meeting right in the middle of a veterans parade and the cops chase him
he gets scared and goes into hiding
gesturing toward schwartz come in dave schwartz
his honor the mayor now comes out with a statement that earl williams is a dangerous character in the employ of two or three foreign governments and the police are
going to get him dead or alive
somebody sends out a tip that this guy is hiding in molly malloys joint
and this colored policeman daniels goes over to pick williams up
williams has read the papers thinks the cop is going to kill him and shoots first
that is all
thats all i want to know
hildy gets up rolls the pair of stockings she has just discarded into a ball crosses to bensingers desk and puts the stockings in a drawer
say thats old prissy bensingers desk
i know i just want to give him a thrill
hildy crosses back to desk and sits down
all right boys now that everything is settled deal me in
hildy glances toward clock on wall
the hands show pm
insert clock hands pointing to pm
she picks up phone nearest her on desk and starts to dial picking up cards dealt her with one hand
into phone hello this is hildy johnson
get me walter burns
she studies her cards then into phone hello walter
hows the old double crosser
telephone at his ear
hello my fine feathered friend
thought i might be hearing from you
what have you got to report
camera pulls back to medium shot and we see that burns is stripped to the waist
a doctor is applying a stethoscope to his chest
we hold the picture a second burns listening intently on the phone and the doctor listening intently to his chest
into phone going all right eh
doctor suddenly realizes what hes said and looks up
putting hand over mouthpiece of phone doctor will you please keep quiet a minute
how do you expect me to get any work done
camera pulls back to include bruce who has some papers in front of him at the desk
how do you expect me to get anywhere if youre going to keep on that phone
if youll just give me two minutes more into phone well they havent finished with me yet but im hoping to get my shirt back
im in the pink of condition
they found two new dimples
cards in her other hand
how about that check
all right mr
burns but remember no checkee no story
well as soon as they decide whether you live or not will you have that new man of mine call me up
she hangs up all right boys
up a dime
right back at you
dropping his cards you fight it cut
and up a dime
studying a second i call
what you got
displaying her cards three bullets
throwing his cards away beats king up
hildy rakes in the money
what are you going to do with all that money hildy
yeah you cant spend it in albany
oh ill think of something
taking in door and including group
bensinger another reporter comes in from the corridor
he stands out from the others because of his tidy appearance and carries a book under his arm
got anything new on the hanging
cockily why dont you fellows get your own news
cant you say hello to a fellow
he comes over to shake hands
are you back
no just a farewell appearance batting for sweeney
im going into business for myself
im getting married tomorrow
why dont you use him for a bridesmaid hildy
come on hildy your deal
he opens a drawer the one in which hildy put her stockings
say who put these stockings in my desk
he turns to the group mccues voice i dont know but i think they got rats in the building
makes a gesture of disgust and picks up telephone this is bensinger
i just saw the sheriff
he wont move the hanging up a minute
all right ill talk to him again but its no use
the execution is set for seven in the morning
get me a rewrite man
dealing the cards
why cant they hang that guy at a reasonable hour so we can get some sleep
into phone jake new lead on the hanging
this new alienist from new york dr
egelhoffer is going to interview williams in about half an hour in the sheriffs office
murphy reaches for the phone
without dropping his cards he jiggles the hook
that must be the tenth alienist theyve had on williams
even if he wasnt crazy before he would be after ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him
into phone gimme the desk
this egelhoffers pretty good
what did he ever do for his country
dont you remember
hes the guy went to washington to interview the brain trust and gave out a statement that they were all sane
it created a sensation
he is referring to his notes as he talks into phone heres the situation on the eve of the hanging he continues playing his cards into phone this is murphy
more slop on the hanging
into phone a double guards been thrown around the jail municipal buildings railroad terminals and elevated stations to prepare for the expected general uprising of radicals at the hour of
into phone ready
the sheriffs just put two hundred more relatives on the payroll to protect the city against the red army which is leaving moscow in a couple of minutes
consults his hand up a dime
into phone the sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life but he says nothing can interfere with his duty
into phone and to prove to the voters that the red menace is on the level the sheriff has written himself four more letters threatening his life
i know he wrote em on account of the misspellings
trouble is when the red menace shows up the sheriff will still be crying wolf
what have you got hildy
kings and sixes
throwing down thats good
sweeping coins in kings and sixes the pot affixes
i learned that at my grandmas knee
thats why i keep losing
my grandma was a modest woman nobody ever saw her knees not even my grandpop
the doctor has gone
burns is adjusting his shirt
bruce is sitting at the desk
i dont know
this makes me feel funny
why shouldnt i make hildy my beneficiary
ive got nobody else to leave it to
i feel i ought to take care of her
well youll take care of her
after all if that doctors right im going to live for a long time yet
look bruce this is a debt of honor
i was a very bad husband hildy could have got a lot of alimony if shed wanted to but she wouldnt take any
she had it coming to her but she was too independent
well im independent too
figure it this way i ought to be good for twenty five years
by that time youll probably have made enough so that the money wont mean anything
but suppose you havent made good dont you think hildys entitled to a quiet old age without any worries
well of course if you put it that way
everything he has on the ball and remember this bruce
i love her too
im beginning to realize that
and the beauty of it is shell never have to know till ive passed on
maybe shell think kindly of me after im gone
a lump in his throat gee you almost make me feel like a heel coming between you
no bruce you didnt come between us
it was all over for her before you came on the scene
for me itll never be over
he turns away wipes his eyes and sneaks a glance to see how that goes over
it goes over big bruce hurriedly wipes a tear away
as duffy comes into the room
he advances toward the desk
placing check on desk heres that certified check walter
sotto voce i drew out my wifes savings and if this isnt back by im a ruined man
also sotto voce dont worry duffy youll have it back by five
louder thanks duffy
picking up check he rises he walks over to bruce
well bruce here you are certified and everything
also rising certified
im afraid hildyd feel ashamed to think she hadnt trusted you
he reacts to this sweetly solemn thought
camera follows them as burns walks bruce toward door his arm around him
well shell know some day
thats all i ask
oh wait a minute
he releases bruce runs back and gets umbrella and brings it to him
dont want to forget this you know
might start to rain again
ill phone hildy right away to get that story
they are at the door
burns opens the door for bruce
louis is sitting at a desk apparently engrossed in a newspaper
he is all alert however
bruce and burns come into the scene talking
well anyway i know hildys getting a good man
embarrassed thanks a lot
they pass louis
he looks up
bruce still embarrassed looks down
burns turns and signals to louis
burns points to bruces back
well i got to get back
you can find your way out cant you
he extends his hand well thanks for everything
dont thank me
i should thank you
he turns and goes
burns watches him
bruce is going out his back toward camera
louis comes between burns and bruce and follows bruce out as we see bruce going toward outer door
he rubs his hands in glee as he starts back for his office
she is raking in a pot
i dont know why you boys are so good to me
throwing cards down your pokers improved a lot hildy
lend me two bucks will you
im playing for keeps
there is a whirr and crash from the gallows
i wish theyd stop that practicing
the others drift into the scene and look out of the window
the trap is sprung by two or three earnest men
turns away well anyhow i wont be covering stuff like this any more
whats the matter
a phone rings
mccue answers it
for you hildy
hildy goes toward phone
oh hello bruce
have you got it
is it certified
certified and everything
got it right here in my wallet
no hes not here im in a phone booth
mccue is hovering near
who is it your milkman
in phone but bruce dont keep it in your wallet
well you see she is thinking rapidly theres an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you you put in the lining of your hat
that brings you good luck for ten years
say ive been a reporter twenty years and never heard any hooey like that
whered you get it
to mccue i made it up just now and whos asking you
into phone i know its silly honey but do it for me wont you
yes right now
wait a minute
he takes check out of wallet folds it into lining of hat
ive done it
now are you satisfied
and heres a kiss for you
she blows a kiss into the phone
immediately we hear kiss sounds all over
she looks up and glares
then back to phone now darling you go back to the hotel and pack and you and mother pick me up here about half past five
he blows a kiss into the phone and hangs up
studying a paper reads it for a moment
bruce comes out of restaurant and starts out
after a second louis follows him
warden cooley sits at a desk near the grilled doorway that leads to the cells
he is studying a racing form
hildys hand reaches into the shot and flicks the newspaper
he looks up
the camera pulls back to include hildy
what are you doing around here
i want to interview earl williams warden
how about a little service
no more interviews
besides a doctors coming over
hildy reaches down out of camera range comes up with bill
say isnt this your twenty dollars
looks at bill eagerly i think it is
handing it over i thought so
come on im in a hurry
cooley pockets the twenty and reaches for his key ring
there is a milling mob around a center of activity that the camera cant find
as he sees this and strolls determinedly toward it
the cop comes in and breaks ranks
he pushes his way toward center and looks down
lying down held by louis
whats going on
this guy stole my watch
lugging them both to feet have you got his watch
i havent any watch
i saw him
he put it in his back pocket
i havent got wait a minute
the cop reaches into bruces back pocket
watch comes out
to louis is this yours
what about it
i never saw it before
cop grabs bruce
louis grabs his other arm
to mob beat it
as they go through crowd
the look on poor bruces face muddy anyhow is something
suddenly bruce cries my hat
get his hat somebody
lying top up in a puddle
hand reaches in and picks it up
as hat is passed to cop who jams it down on bruces head
another takem from bruce
at the door of earl williams cell
hildy sits on a stool at the door pencil and copy paper in hand
earl williams sits at the edge of his cot facing hildy
there is a bouquet of roses in a water pitcher by the cot
our first impression of williams is that hes a rational well poised citizen
it is only under hildys questioning that he gradually reveals himself
i couldnt plead insanity because you see im just as sane as anybody else
puzzled and worried you didnt mean to kill that policeman
of course not
i couldnt kill anybody its against everything ive ever stood for
they know it was an accident
theyre not hanging me for that theyre hanging me for my beliefs
what are your beliefs earl
theyre very simple
i believe in the golden rule
im not the first man to die for preaching it
but if they would only listen to it we could have a fine decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things
how would you go about applying the golden rule earl
id do away with the profit system and have production for use only
theres enough food and clothing and shelter for everybody if wed use some sense
writing production for use only
well maybe thats the answer
its the only answer
everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose we could solve all our problems
food was meant to be eaten not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved clothing was meant to be worn not piled up in stores while people went naked
doesnt that make sense
thoughtfully yes that makes a lot of sense earl
just use things for what they were meant thats all
she studies him a moment whats the purpose of a gun earl
he thinks then a revealing smile breaks out why to shoot of course
is that how you came to shoot the policeman
you see id never had a gun in my hand before and i didnt know what to do with it
well when i get stuck i know that theres an answer for everything in production for use
so it came to me in a flash whats a gun for
so i shot
simple isnt it
writing very simple earl
theres nothing crazy about that is there
no earl not at all
she indicates the flowers who sent you the flowers earl
reverently miss mollie malloy
shes a wonderful person
pointing to picture pinned on wall isnt that her picture
turning toward it yes
isnt she beautiful
if you should be pardoned are you figuring on marrying mollie
oh no shes much too good for me
howd you get in here
sheriff hartman has come into the scene
hildy turns toward him
same way you did
pointing through that gate
i gave strict orders that nobody was to interview williams without my permission
all right then ill just run the story that sheriff hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner
of course with election coming that might do you a lot of harm but just as you say
now wait a minute
im not afraid of anything
what were you going to write about williams
oh nothing much
just that the state had proved he was sane and he admits it himself
if you dont want me to run it beaming oh thatll be all right hildy
go ahead run it
and you can say i treated him well too
turning toward williams lo earl
how are you feeling
fine thanks sheriff
thats good earl
oh theyve got another alienist to see you
he ought to be here any minute
dont go to sleep will you
to hildy hildy howd you like a couple of tickets for the hanging
in a low voice so williams wont overhear no thanks sheriff
im leaving town tonight
just as loud as ever you ought to stay over
you always wrote a good hanging story hildy
thats awful kind of you sheriff
ive got to get started on my interview
see you later
dont forget about production for use
i wont earl
she goes the game is on
bensinger at his desk is reading a book
the electric lights have been switched on
raking in a pot well a guy can win when hildy aint around
whos this guy shes gonna marry
baldwin his name is
i give that marriage six months
hildy wont be able to stay away from a paper any longer than that
did you see her eyes light up when she came in here
like an old fire horse
she says shes gonna write fiction
well if shes gonna write fiction theres nothing like being a reporter
ill give ten to five that marriage wont last six months
hildys a newspaper man
shes got headlines in her veins the way we all have or wed be out of these lousy jobs
mollie malloy appears in doorway
she moves slowly into the room
well well miss mollie malloy
hows tricks mollie
ive been lookin for you tramps
kid those were pretty roses you sent earl
what do you want done with them tomorrow morning
tensely a lot of wise guys aint you
uncomfortably youre breaking up the game mollie
what do you want
i want to tell you what i think of you all of you
hildy appears in the doorway and comes into the room
keep your shirt on
to murphy if you was worth breaking my fingers on id tear your face wide open
hildy goes to desk and begins typing away
what are you sore about sweetheart
wasnt that a swell story we gave you
you crumbs have been making a fool out of me long enough
rising and coming over she oughtnt be allowed in here
flaring i never said i loved earl williams and was willing to marry him on the gallows
you made that up
and about my being his soul mate and having a love nest with him
looking up at her
youve been sucking around that cuckoo ever since hes been in the death house
everybody knows youre his sweetheart
she blows up
thats a lie
i met mr
williams just once in my life when he was wandering around in the rain without his hat and coat on like a sick dog the day before the shooting
i went up to him like any human being would and i asked him what was the matter and he told me about being fired after working at the same
place for fourteen years and i brought him up to my room because it was warm there
she is typing away stops to look over at mollie then resolutely turns away studies her stuff and begins typing again
aw put it on a phonograph
just because you want to fill your lying paper with a lot of dirty scandal you got to crucify him and make a stooge out of me
to mollie got a match
heedless i tell you he just sat there talking to me all night
and never once laid a hand on me
in the morning he went away and i never saw him again till that day at the trial
the boys laugh
she lashes out at them
go on laugh
id like to know some curses bad enough for your greasy souls
sure i was his witness the only one he had
yes me cheap little mollie malloy
im everything the district attorney said i was
and still i was the only one with guts enough to stand up for him
i told the truth and the district attorney knows it
thats why youre persecutin me
because earl williams treated me decent and not like an animal and i said so
finally irritated go into your dance
this is the press room
why dont you go and see your boy friend
winks at the others but youll have to hurry up he left a call for seven a
through her teeth its a wonder a bolt of lightning dont come down and strike you all dead
comes sound of the gallows
suddenly uncomfortable dont get hysterical kid
begins to sob shame on you
hysterically a poor little fellow that never meant nobody no harm
sitting there alone this minute with the angel of death beside him and you cracking jokes
typing away furiously regardless of this
she ends a page
the sound of mollie sobbing comes over the scene
hildy inserts a fresh page
if you dont shut up well give you something to cry about
hildy looks o
and rises determinedly
she is still sobbing
hildy comes into scene and puts her arm around mollie
gently come on mollie
this is no place for you
she leads mollie toward door theyre not human
theyre newspaper men mollie
they cant help themselves
the lord made them that way
one look back as hildy leads her out door it wasnt the lord
it was the devil
hildy and mollie exit
there is a pause
the boys look at each other uncomfortably
the phone rings
wilson goes to answer
picking up cards you guys wanna play some more poker
whats the use
i cant win a pot
into phone who
she just stepped out
shell be back in a second
well if youll hang on a minute she ought to be right in
he covers transmitter to others baldwin
the blushing bridegroom himself
whats he want
wants hildy and sounds very excited
hildy comes back
looks at them and stares contemptuously
gentlemen of the press
always picking on somebody who cant defend himself the littler the better
phone for you hildy
going toward it who is it
oh some insurance man
are you in
grabbing phone give me that
into phone hello
where are you
how did that happen
she listens unbelievingly a second ill be right over
as hildy hangs up and darts out of room
the others watch in amazement
boy did you see her go
lioness rushes to defense of cub
i told you baldwin was in trouble
probably went out without his hankie and wants mamma to wipe his nose
i still give that marriage six months
hello baby get me the sheriffs offico will you
hello sheriff hartman
this is bensinger
how about that favor
you know what once and for all will you hang this guy at five a
instead of seven
it wont hurt you and we can make the city edition
indignantly once and for all im not going to hang anybody except at the legal hour
dont threaten me bensinger
im not afraid of any newspapers
oh shut up
he hangs up an afterthought he calls up operator and operator i told you not to disturb me
i dont care who calls i dont want to be disturbed again till i tell you
he hangs up turns to somebody o
and speaks how do you like that dr
want me to hang williams at their convenience
camera pulls back to a med
group shot showing williams sheriff hartman and dr
they are the only occupants of room
williams is seated facing a large standing searchlight
sheriff theyre the scum of modern civilization
you said it
theyre always after me for interviews
fencing of course i sort of promised them i would give out a statement when i got through here
you dont mind
not liking it well i dont know if thats ethical
you see all statements are supposed to come from me
hell bargain well have to satisfy them
what would you say to giving them a joint interview
i could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects
he buys a joint interview eh
that might be all right
we could have our pictures taken together doctor
yes shaking hands
i dont take a very good picture though
it doesnt matter
the publicitys the main thing
yes i suppose so
it all helps
just a spectator up to now are you gentlemen all through with me
oh im sorry
i forgot you were here
williams we still have some questions for you
sheriff will you kindly extinguish the lights
the sheriff puts out the lights and the doctor switches on the searchlight which shines in williams face
you know you are to be executed mr
who do you feel is responsible for that
but im not afraid to die doctor
im dying for what i believe
you realize however that you committed a crime
in a legal sense yes
but not actually
actually im innocent
i didnt do anything
i didnt do anything
i never stole a watch in my life
camera pulls back to show us bruce in police cell
a police lieutenant with her in b
i know you didnt bruce
she whirls on lieutenant
to lieutenant let him out of here lieutenant
conciliatingly but hildy i cant
hes accused of stealing a watch
and they found the watch on him
and who accused him
one of the worst crooks in town
why dont you arrest louis instead of innocent people that he frames
now hildy dont hildy me
are you going to let him out
but tomorrow the post will run the story of that roulette game on rd street that your brother in law runs
and well print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it
now hildy dont be hasty
i cant let him out
you can let him out on bail cant you
five hundred dollars
youll take fifty and like it
wavers well all right
but im liable to get into a jam
he starts to open cell door
youll get into a worse one if you dont
hildy is combing bruces hair
he begins to look presentable
he fumbles in his breast pocket
whats the matter
i lost my wallet
stops the check bruce
bruce picks up his hat and gets check out of lining
thats right here
gee it was lucky your telling me about that old newspaper superstition
taking check and putting it away yes wasnt it
i cant imagine who did it
i cant think of any enemies i have
looking at him fondly im sure you havent any
for a minute i thought maybe walter burns was at the back of it
but then i realized he couldnt have been
how could you ever think of such a thing
oh i realized right away
hes really a very nice fellow hildy i found that out
yes he is
look bruce were taking that next train and when i say next train this time i mean it
did you finish the interview
to driver the criminal courts building
the driver nods
to bruce no but im sure itll be all right with walter
but gee hildy he gave us that insurance business and you promised well the storys practically finished
ill just go upstairs and send it over with a messenger
the cab stops
hildy gets out and bruce starts to follow
hildy turns and pushes him back in the cab
at door of cab
bruce in cab
no you stay here
im not taking any more chances
ill be down in three minutes and dont you dare move
hildy turns and starts for stairs of criminal courts building
schwartz is reading hildys interview to the other boys who are grouped around
bensinger is at his desk a book open but listening
reading but the state has a production for use plan too
it has a gallows and at seven a
unless a miracle occurs that gallows will be used to separate the soul of earl williams from his body
and out of molly malloys life will go the one kindly soul she ever knew he stops thats as far as hildy got
but i ask you can that girl write an interview
i dont think its very ethical reading other peoples stuff
dont give us that ethics stuff
youll be the only one wholl swipe any of it
i still say anybody that writes like that aint going to give it up permanently to sew sox for a guy in the insurance business
now i give that marriage three months and im laying three to one
ill take that bet
hildy comes into the scene
going to her phone its getting so a girl cant step out of the room without being discussed by a bunch of old ladies
into phone her voice assumes a silken quality hello post
walter burns please
embarrassed well hildy we were only saying that a swell reporter like you wouldnt give this up so easily
into phone this is hildy johnson
to schwartz oh i can give it up all right
without a single quiver
im going to live like a human being not like you rats
into phone oh is that you walter dear
oh i didnt mean dear
that was just habit i guess
oh be yourself walter
ive got some news for you
yes i got the interview but ive got some news thats more important
the others are listening suspecting a scoop
better get a pencil out and write it down
then with a sudden change of pace get this you double crossing chimpanzee there aint gonna be any interview and there aint gonna be any story
that certified check of yours is leaving with me in twenty minutes
and if i ever see you again its going to be just too bad
oh you dont know what im angry about do you
if you come over ill be very glad to tell you the story of louies watch
i dare you to come over you you skunk in sheeps clothing
and bring that bodyguard of yours too youll need him
and i just want you to listen to one more thing
she gets her story out of typewriter applies it to transmitter and tears it up
thats the interview i wrote
yes i know we made a bargain
i just said id write it i didnt say i wouldnt tear it up
yes its all in little pieces now walter and i hope to do the same for you some time
she hangs up
she reaches under her desk pulls up bag talking all the time
the others are too startled to do anything but listen
and thats my farewell to the newspaper game
im going to live a normal life and have a home
she reaches into the drawer of desk and gets some stuff which she puts into bag
im going to be a woman not a newsgetting machine
im going to have babies and nurse them and love them and give em cod liver oil and worry about their new teeth and the minute i catch one of
them even looking at a newspaper im going to brain him
wheres my hat
someone points to her hat
she rises and goes toward it
her bag is still open
her phone rings
schwartz answers it
subdued tones hello mr
yes shes still here
stopping midway to her hat ill take it
she comes over to phone whats the matter mr
burns dont you understand english
why your language is shocking mr
burns positively shocking
i dont mind because i was married to you and know what to expect but suppose central is listening in
oh did you hear that central
we ought to report him dont you think
oh fooey on you
she pulls the phone out of the wall walks toward window and tosses it out of the window
she waits for the crash turns back and says now where was that hat
she starts toward it
i hope youre pretty nearly through with me doctor im getting a little fatigued
yeah you dont want to tire him out doctor
just one thing more
id like to reenact the crime mr
may i have your gun please sheriff
hartman starts to take gun out hesitates
i dont know insistently come come sheriff lightning doesnt strike in the same place twice
nothings going to happen
hartman hands him the gun
now the sheriff will be mollie malloy in whose room you were
you will be earl williams
and i will be the policeman
follow me mr
egelhoffer hands the gun to williams and then backs up a few paces
so now i say to you earl williams you are under arrest
and you point your gun at me
hesitantly well it wasnt exactly that way insistently point the gun at me
williams does so
then what did you do
williams hesitates for a moment and then pulls the trigger
hartman promptly dives under the desk as egelhoffer topples over
pathetically now can i go please
there is a loud banging on the door and a voice calling hey sheriff
williams alarmed by voice turns and starts toward window
hildy is now wearing her hat and gloves
she picks up her bag and starts for the door
so long hildy
send us a postcard kid
wholl keep the lamp in the window for you
hildy has crossed to doorway the camera trucking with her
she turns and faces the room to make a last bravura speech
well goodbye you wage slaves
when youre crawling up fire escapes getting kicked out of front doors and eating christmas dinners in one armed joints dont forget your pal hildy johnson
and remember my husband sells insurance
she turns and starts on a bit of verse it takes a heap o livin to make a house a home
she is interrupted by a terrific fusillade of shots in the courtyard
a roar of excited voices comes up
for a tense second everyone is motionless
there is another volley of shots
wilson endicott and murphy jump for the window
get the riot guns
spread out you fellows
theres a jail break
at window simultaneously cooley
whats the matter whats happened
watch the gate
hes probably trying the gate
outside a siren begins to wail
out the window who got away
who was it
whod he say
it was earl williams
he got away
gimme that telephone
works hook frantically hurry
this is important
searchlights hit the windows sweeping from direction of the jail
hildy stands paralyzed her bundle in her hand
there is another rifle volley
two windowpanes crash into the room
some plaster falls
gongs sound above the siren
the boys are jumping for their telephones
another windowpane goes
screaming look out
out the window look out where youre aiming will you
of reporters at their various phones follows gimme the desk
earl williams just escaped
dont know yet call you back
are shouted into the phones by schwartz wilson mccue endicott bensinger and murphy
after each man communicates with his paper he dashes for the door
the last of the reporters is gone
her bag almost unnoticed falls to the floor
camera trucks with her as she moves back into the room absently grabbing and trailing a chair
ahhh she lets go of the chair and takes one of the telephones

gesturing out shooting everybody they see for the fun of it
with dignity if youre talking about my brother in law hes worked for the city fifteen years
they come to the door of the sheriffs office
hartman opens door and the mayor enters hartman following
hartman closes door and turns to mayor who faces him portentously
pete youre through
stunned what do you mean through

its nothing personal
and pete its the only way out
its a sacrifice we all ought to be glad to make
david to jonathan fred

fred i dont know what to say
a thing like this almost destroys a mans faith in human nature
i wish you wouldnt talk like that pete

wavering and desperate if there was any way out
as a phone rings there is a way out
ive got williams surrounded havent i

into phone hello
wildly four hundred suppers
this is a man hunt not a banquet
the twelve dollars includes everything
he hangs up
that gives you an idea of what im up against
hotly were up against a lot more than that with that nutty slogan you invented reform the reds with a rope
williams aint a red and you know it
well theres a lot of communistic sympathizers around i know it
but theyve got nothing to do with this case
do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang earl williams were going to lose em
but were going to hang him fred
he cant get away
a knock on the door
what do you mean he cant get away

sheriff starts for door
sheriff opens the door
a small very colorless and ineffectual man named pinkus is there
as he opens door disclosing pinkus im sheriff hartman

annoyed what do you want
taking a document from his pocket and proffering it to sheriff im a messenger at the state house

the sheriff with shaking hands opens and begins to read the thing
they were all standing around when he wrote it
it was after they got back from fishing
to sheriff get the governor on the phone
helpfully you cant get him on the phone
hes out duckshooting now
how do you like that
a guy does nothing more strenuous for forty years than play pinochle he gets elected governor and right away he thinks hes tarzan
thrusting the document at the mayor read it
insane he says
shaking a finger in pinkus face he knows very well that williams aint insane
but i interrupting pure politics
an attempt to ruin us
the phone rings
hartman starts for it
reading dementia praecox oh h h

theres a fine opening for a fellow like you in the city sealers office
the city sealers office

a very deliberate intellect no i couldnt do that

he pushes money into pinkuss hand and pushes him through the door
into phone desperately will you wait olsen

the door opens again and pinkus comes back in
you forgot to tell me what a city sealer has to do
turning hastily toward pinkus ill explain it tomorrow
is it hard
its easy its very easy
pleadingly into phone just one second thats good because my health aint what it used to be
pushing him out the door well fix that too
he closes the door after him into phone one more plea just one second
he turns to the mayor with a gesture of appeal
the mayor closes the door and turns to hartman
huskily all right
tell em to shoot to kill
shoot to kill i said
i dont know fred
theres that reprieve if they ever find out
nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered
now do as i tell you
into phone hello olsen
his voice is weak shoot to kill

we dont want him
and listen olsen five hundred bucks for the guy that does the job
yes ill be right out there
hangs up well i hope thats the right thing to do
now take that guilty look off your face pete and stop trembling like a horse
mopping his brow if we didnt have election tuesday id have this on my conscience
louie comes from the direction of the stairs and crosses toward door to press room
he pauses a moment puts his hand in his pocket pulls out some bills counts them and opens the door
hildy is still pacing pounding her hands together and glancing every so often at the clock on the wall
suddenly she crosses to her phone picks up transmitter into phone will you try hildy
wheeling towards door louie
she drops the phone and hurries towards him
have you got my dough
the boss sent me over with it
four hundred dollars wasnt it
four hundred and fifty and ill cut your throat if you try any tricks

grabbing him so long nothing

i dont know what youre talking about but is this mr

i didnt frisk him
he must have dropped it in burns office
i didnt know whose it was
no and you dont know that your cheap boss has had mr
baldwin arrested again do you
surprised what already
why the dame left only a minute before i did
he suddenly realizes what hes said and sprints for the door
hildy chucks something at him
it just misses as he ducks out of the door
hildy casts a savage look after the departed louie takes another look at the clock and grabs a phone and starts to dial
into phone th precinct station house
hildy stops short arrested by a sound from the open window
she turns and sees earl williams looking more inoffensive and exhausted than ever indeed on the verge of collapse
he carries a large revolver
the search lights that have been playing in the courtyard strike into the windows again
pointing gun at her drop that phone hildy drops the phone back on the hook
supporting himself by holding on to edge of desk youre not going to phone anybody where i am
bracing herself put down that gun earl
he advances steadily toward hildy the gun aimed at her
youre not going to shoot me earl
im your friend remember
ive got to write that story about your production for use
yes thats right
production for use
hildy starts walking toward him slowly
earl you dont want to hurt your friends do you
maybe youre my friend and maybe youre not but dont come any nearer
you cant trust anybody in this crazy world
say ill bet i could shoot you from here
sure you could earl but you wouldnt want to do that would you
you wouldnt want to kill anybody
no no youre right
i dont want to kill anybody
all i want to do is be let alone
hildy sneaks another step forward
earl theres just one thing i ought to clear up for the interview
only youre getting too near
i dont trust anybody
i dont blame you earl
another step forward if i were in your place i wouldnt trust anybody either
suddenly keep away
he points the gun at hildy pulls the trigger and we hear a faint click
weakly i guess i used all the shells
he drops the gun and clutches at the edge of the desk for support
hildy lurches forward and she grabs the other side of the desk for support
and at this moment she looks more tired than he does
she looks at earl and breathes heavily
earl you must never do that again
oh im awful tired
i couldnt go through another day like this
more her old self now well maybe you think i could
camera follows her as she retrieves the gun and jams it in her purse jumps to the windows pulls down the shades
im not afraid to die
i was tellin the fella that when he handed me the gun
hildy crosses swiftly to the door locks it and puts out the lights so that they are visible only faintly in the light from the areaway
dont talk too loud
babbling on as she moves about wakin me up in the middle of the night talkin to me about things they dont understand
callin me a bolshevik
im an anarchist
its got nothin to do with bombs
its the philosophy that guarantees every man freedom
you see that dont you
sure i do earl
hildy is looking around for a hiding place for him
i wish theyd take me back and hang me
i done my best
he abruptly crumples and falls to the floor
hildy stands for a second desperate
then she picks him up and half carries half drags him over toward a chair and places him in it
then she makes a quick dash for her phone
into phone hello
gimme walter burns quick
another phone there rings
hildy answers it propping the receiver of her own phone between ear and shoulder

mollie is lying quietly on the floor with her eyes closed
hildy rushes over to water cooler and gets a paper cup full of water

her scream of terror is heard as she drops
then rush as the reporters rush in and look out an assortment of awed and astonished exclamations rising from them
she turns away from the window and hides her face in her hands
take me out of here
take me a moan oh h she collapses to a chair
turning get the cops somebody
turning come on fellas
they start in a rush for the door
as the reporters rush out and hildy crosses dazed to the window
the poor kid
the poor kid
reaching the window she looks out
the form of mollie on the pavement below moves slightly in the moonlight as guards rush into scene to her
of guards rushing in get a doctor
take her to the infirmary
she aint killed shes moving
hildy turns shaken back into the room from the window and sees advancing to her across the room walter burns
diamond louie has entered with the boss and stands leaning by the door
baldwins face is still hidden by her hands
hildy starts for burns
d did you see gesturing back to window that

as louie comes in to mrs

extending his hand as if to shake hands with mrs
baldwin my name is louis peluso
unluckily for her she responds only to find herself jerked to her feet and spun around so that one of louies arms is about her waist and the other hand
over her mouth
louie starts her to door

hildy starts after them when burns arm comes into scene catching her

as the taxi darts through traffic narrowly avoiding cars trucks etc
it comes almost head on to an oncoming car
louie worried ducks unconsciously
baldwin faints across his lap
the taxi swerves just in time to duck the oncoming car
as it starts forward again a truck comes toward the cab head on
diamond louie pushes mrs
baldwin into an upright position takes a look through the windshield sees the truck and gives a big takem and faints across mrs
the truck and taxicab crash and the screen blacks out
at typewriter smoke rising from her cigarette
as the camera angle widens we see a fairly disheveled hildy typing away furiously
into phone the blackest cesspool in american city life
hold on duffy ill see if shes got any more
burns comes into the scene tears a page out of hildys typewriter
she inserts another one without noticing
burns goes back to the phone as hildy continues to type furiously
into phone duffy duffy
clicking the phone furiously operator

somebody cut us off
as bruce baldwin enters
what the devil do you want

bruce comes into the scene
looking up very casually hello bruce
she resumes her typing then suddenly realizes the situation and jumps up
howd you get out
the hands off attitude not through any help of yours hildy
bruce i know but i was in the biggest jam hildy
as hildy turns toward his voice burns still with the phone in his hand keeps talking to her
for petes sake hildy theyre waiting for the rest of that story
resignedly okay walter
sits down at her typewriter again hildy begins typing again
i waited and waited and then i had an idea and wired albany to send me a hundred dollars so i could get out on bail
desperately i dont know what theyll think they sent it to the police station
she barely stops typing well explain the whole thing to them
resumes typing i know i got you into this hildy but it does seem to me that you cant care much for me if youre willing to let me stay
locked up for two hours
bruce you know im mad about you and stop talking like that
to walter walter
into phone take the presidents speech and run it on the funny page
turns to hildy o

she types furiously its top opens slowly and williams head sticks out
screaming get back in there you mock turtle
the desk top falls the fugitive disappearing within
turning around toward burns

she types away

as he leads bruce away toward door
i know how you feel bruce but youve got to forgive her

he hands the money to burns
burns looks at it carefully and hands it back
oh this is all right bruce

hildy is typing furiously
burns enters grinning locks the door behind him and goes to phone and picks it up
into phone duffy
he turns and crosses quickly to look out the window
burns coming in to window
despairingly now the moons out
he turns away crossing to the desk the camera trucking with him
at the desk he taps three times being answered by three taps from within
three taps is me
youre sitting pretty now
got enough air
he raises top an inch or two and fans air in to williams
is that better
now breathe deep
we hear an intake of breath from inside the desk
he closes the desk and turns back to the table
as he passes hildy who is still typing rapidly looking over her shoulder thats the stuff
lam it into em hildy
he jerks the sheet from hildys machine crosses to his desk and picks up the phone
into phone hello
here we go
reading from the page he has taken from hildys typewriter
into phone in the darkest hour of the citys history at the end of the hall are glass doors through which can be seen a turmoil of activity in the
street outside newsboys a crowd and a mounted policeman or two
bruce comes down the hall his face set and angry
as he goes he sees a sign set over a doorway in the hall
it reads missing persons bureau
he stops and enters
into phone listen did you impress it on butch that i want him and his gang here right away
every minute counts
puts receiver down on table duffys getting old
hes on the way
over her typing hed better hurry
the boysll be coming back to phone

we want an extra out on the streets before its too late
looking up suddenly wheres bruce
oh er he went out to get the tickets

didnt you hear him
of course hes coming back here
keep going will you
as burns leaves hildy and goes over to desk and picks up his phone again
into phone duffy
finding the door locked he knocks
as another knock comes they take it big
calling who is it
whats the idea of locking this
thats his desk
whispering whats his name
the door knob is rattled violently
bensinger of the tribune

he starts for the door
ill handle him
camera trucks with him to the door

he opens the door
as he comes in aint you got any more sense than to sees burns and is overcome oh h hello mr
why quite an honor having you come over here
casually hello bensinger
excuse me i just want to he starts for the desk
hildys typing goes on coming in over the scene
starting for the desk suddenly blocking his path quite a coincidence my running into you tonight
isnt it hildy
how do you mean
i was having a little chat about you just this afternoon with our mister duffy
essaying a pleasantry nothing ah detrimental i hope
i should say not
that was one swell story you had in the paper this morning
deeply moved oh did you care for the poem mr
startled the poem
the poem was great
blinking at these words remember the ending
and he recites and all is well outside his cell but in his heart he hears the hangman calling and the gallows falling and his white haired mothers tears
how would you like to work for me
taking in table hildy typing there
to bensinger we need somebody like you
all weve got now are a lot of low brows
like johnson here
he starts shoving bensinger away from the desk toward the table
clinging to him burns takes him to the phone
into phone duffy
im sending bensinger over to see you
looking up at bensinger mervyn isnt it
with a little laugh at his own forgetfulness of course
into phone roy bensinger the poet
of course you wouldnt know
you probably never heard of shakespeare either
bensinger right on the staff
to bensinger how much are you getting on the tribune roy
ill give you a hundred and a by line
as burns continues
into phone let him have everything he wants
puts down the receiver turns to bensinger now hustle and write me a story from the point of view of the escaped man
acting it out he hides cowering
afraid of every light of every sound
his heart going like that
and all the time theyre closing in
get the sense of an animal at bay
sort of a jack london style
leads him hurriedly to the door
i got my rhyming dictionary in indicating desk getting him to door it doesnt have to rhyme
as bensinger turns there
gee im terribly grateful mister burns
do you suppose there might be an opening some time as foreign correspondent
i parley a little french you know
burns shakes hands with him and opens the door with the other hand
ill keep you in mind
going au revoir mon capitaine
never at a loss in any language bon jour
continuing his french he gets the door closed and relocked and turns for the table singing as he does so mademoiselle from armontieres parlay burns returns alertly to table not
noticing that hildy has stopped typing and sits staring moodily before her
into phono duffy
a rat from the tribune is coming over to get a job bensinger the guy i told you about
handle him with kid gloves
tell him to get busy writing poetry
no we dont want him
stall him along until the extra comes out
then tell him his poetry stinks and kick him downstairs
he lays down receiver
taking in hildy
she looks up at him
to burns double crossing swine
you said it
but thisll teach him a lesson
he wont quit his paper without giving notice after this
hildy doesnt bother to reply
she rests her chin on her hands and stares moodily ahead
tear into it will you
dont sit there like a frozen robin
he grabs the last sheet of paper out of her typewriter kisses her and rushes over to the telephone
into phone duffy
all right here we go
and got it out as soon as you can
i want this paper out on the streets in half an hour
reading hildys copy so once more the morning post diamond louie bearing evidence of a mishap his hat crushed his face bruised and his clothes torn comes running down the
sidewalk and up the steps into the buildings
hildy is up now pacing
bruce ought to be back by now
walter youre not trying anything again are you

louie slips in and burns relocks the door
seeing louies disarray whats the matter
hildy crosses to louie

as hildy flings the door open only to find the sheriff accompanied by two deputies carl and frank and surrounded by mccue murphy schwartz wilson and endicott
there she is
hildy makes a decision and tries to push through them but the sheriff grabs her and pushes her back
just a minute johnson

burns comes into scene

the deputies seize hildy
look out you nervously whats the use of fighting hildy
hildy manages to get in a few resounding smacks on the deputies faces
the reporters swarm around the struggling trio
there are shouts of i got her
no you dont
in the struggle hildy suddenly drops her purse
it lands with a clank and comes open
a gun is revealed on the floor
hildy picks it up
hey shes got a gun
look out shes got a gun
the deputies and reporters start to close in on her cautiously
trying to face in all directions no you dont
what is it
she tosses the gun to walter but one of the deputies intercepts the throw
he takes the gun from the deputy
the sheriff stands frozen staring at the gun
to hildy whered you get this
ive got a right to carry a gun if i want to
not this gun
burns comes into scene
easily i can explain that hartman
when hildy told me she wanted to interview earl williams i thought it might be dangerous and i gave her a gun to defend herself
oh you did
well thats very very interesting
this happens to be the gun that earl williams shot his way out with
advancing on sheriff are you trying to make me out a liar
bitterly at hildy its the last time i ever trust a woman hildy
maybe williams was gonna be her best man
thats pretty rotten hildy
crossing your own pals
shoving up to hildy trembling where is earl williams
where you got him
sympathetically youre barking up the wrong tree hartman
ill give you three minutes to tell me where he is
he went over to the hospital to call on professor egelhoffer
with a bag of marshmallows
the sheriff stands silent then hastily turns
come on hildy
where is he
this is a sweet trick hildy
i thought we were friends
to sheriff look here pete
what about mister burns
ask the master mind
whats he doing over here
grabbing burns arm speak up
what do you know about this
gently but firmly disengaging his hand my dear hartman
he moves casually to a post before the desk and maintains it
where is he
to sheriff the morning post is not obstructing justice or hiding criminals
you ought to know that
well turning to hildy johnson youre under arrest
turning to burns you too burns
calmly whos under arrest
you pimple headed square toed spy do you realize what youre doing
ill show you what im doing
burns youre guilty of obstructing justice and so is the morning post
im going to see that the post is fined ten thousand dollars for this
youll see nothing of the kind sheriff
well just start by impounding the post property
pointing to bensingers desk addressing hildy is that your desk
almost simultaneously yes
what are you afraid of hildy
i dare him to move that desk out of here
oh you do eh
to deputies all right boys

several of the deputies start toward the desk
trying to intercept deputies hartman if you take this desk out of this building ill put you behind bars
you will eh
well well see about that
to deputies all right boys
im warning you itll be a federal offense
to deputy nearest him and youll be an accessory
well take a chance on that burns
to deputies go ahead boys
the deputies continue toward the desk flanked by two policemen mrs
baldwin dishevelled with her hat over one ear is marching toward the press room bound for vengeance
bruce considerably upset is with her
as they reach the door to the press room mrs
you wait outside bruce
but mother firmly no
youll weaken when you see that little jezebel
im going to tell her what i think of her
she plumps her hat down more firmly on her head and marches into the press room followed by the two policemen
bruce remains outside the door
taking in door as it opens and mrs
baldwin followed by the policemen comes in
leaping forward mother
pointing out burns to the officers that man there
oh im so glad to see you
are you all right
baldwin indignantly shakes her off
whats the idea here
this lady claims she was kidnapped
they dragged me all the way down the stairs just a minute

he was the one in charge of everything
he told them to kidnap me

to sheriff ill tell you something more

fidgeting come on sheriff
weve got to get bail
continuing crescendo i was in here and they had some kind of murderer in with them
they were hiding him
this is a bombshell
the room is electrified
murphy followed by the reporters comes into scene
hiding him where
where was he
whered they have him
at the desk
with superb indignation madam youre a cockeyed liar
and you know it
to emphasize his righteousness he pounds on the desk three times forgetting that that is his signal to williams
then realizing what he has done he gasps
burns advances from desk the others retreating before him
anxiously come on sheriff weve got to get bail
three answering knocks come from the desk
they jump around to face the desk
whispering what was that
hes in the desk
for the love of hes in there
i thought so

look out sheriff
he may shoot
get your guns out
the policemen and deputies get out their guns
dont take any chances
shoot through the desk
he cant hurt anybody
youve got his gun
panic stricken oh dear

she streaks for the door flings it open and goes
the reporters tear out of scene to their telephones
to policeman you stand there

to another policeman you there
to a deputy pointing with his gun toward the window you cover the window
look out where youre pointing that gun
the sheriff draws his men in around the desk their guns drawn on it

burns makes a sudden lunge for the morning post phone and cries into it
into phone duffy
all the lawyers in the world arent going to help you
this is the morning post youre talking to
enjoying himself the power of the press huh
pinkus the governors messenger plentifully stewed reels in the door
he approaches the mayor and sheriff who have their backs to him
at the mayor bigger men than you have found out what the power of the press is
yes and kings
woozy handing sheriff the reprieve over his shoulder heres your reprieve
the mayor and sheriff spin around
in a panic get out of here
you cant bribe me
get out of here you
heres your reprieve
i dont want to be city sealer
i dont like seals anyhow
who is this man
to an officer throw him out frank
seizing pinkus with her free hand who was bribing you
burns also seizes pinkus who is being pulled out of shape
they wouldnt take it
triumphant what did i tell you
an unseen power
to pinkus whats your name
you drunken idiot
the idea of coming here with a cock and bull story like that
its a frame up
wait a minute
to the officers let go there
to sheriff and mayor murder uh
hanging an innocent man to win an election
thats a lie
i never saw him before
to pinkus when did you deliver this first
who did you talk to
they started right in bribing me
indicating the mayor and sheriff them
thats absurd on the face of it mr
hes talking like a child
out of the mouths of babes
hes insane or drunk or something
why if this unfortunate man williams has really been reprieved i personally am tickled to death
arent you pete
go on youd kill your mother to get elected
thats a horrible thing to say miss johnson about anybody
to burns now look here walter youre an intelligent man interrupting just a minute
to pinkus all right mr
lets have your story
well i been married for ten years and interrupting skip all that
loudly take those handcuffs off our friends pete
that wasnt at all necessary
springing to obey i was just going to
he gets the key from the officer
walter i cant tell you how badly i feel about this
there was no excuse for hartwell to fly off the handle
unlocking the handcuffs i was only doing my duty
nothing personal in it
they are set free
you guys better quit politics and take in washing
looking over the reprieve sheriff this document is authentic
earl williams has been reprieved this commonwealth has been spared the painful necessity of shedding blood
save that for the tribune
to pinkus what did you say your name was pinkus
he shows the mayor a locket
heres the picture of my wife
a very fine looking women
mysteriously angered shes good enough for me
and if i was to go home and tell my wife i understand perfectly mr
pinkus and as long as i am mayor which ought to be about three hours more id say
just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment
and your arrest
youll each get about ten years i think
dont make any hasty decisions mr
burns you might run into a thumping big libel suit
youre going to run into the governor
trying to brush it off now my old friend the governor and i understand each other perfectly
eagerly and so do i
with superb contempt so do you what you hoodoo
to pinkus suavely and now mr
pinkus if youll come with us well take you over to the wardens office and deliver this reprieve
the sheriff pinkus and the mayor go out of scene
dreamily wait till those two future jailbirds read the morning post tomorrow
walter turns to hildy and they suddenly smile at each other
how was that for a tight squeeze
dont tell me you were worried
i was petrified
as long as we were in there together pitching they couldnt lick us
well its been a lot of fun
in a way
laughs i mean working together
just like the old days
the things weve been through hildy
weve certainly been in some swell jams
remember the time we broke into the d
s office and copied fifi randells diary
what about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory
six scoop interviews
yeah but that time we stole old lady haggertys stomach off the coroners physician
we proved she was poisoned though didnt we
laughing we sure did but we had to go in hiding for a week
in the shoreland hotel
and our only chaperon was the poor old ladys stomach
dont remind me
thats how we happened to she breaks off
there is a moments pause
i didnt mean to be making love to another mans fiancee
thats all right walter
its as much my fault as yours
glancing at the clock bruce is making the nine oclock train
i told him youd be on it unless you want to write this story yourself
well if its my last story id like it to be a good one
but i guess i cant walter
suit yourself kid
this isnt for me to decide
of course you could make a later train and still be in albany tomorrow morning
i suppose i could
but walter hes going to have you the rest of his life hildy
cant you give me another hour
i dont know what to do walter
flip a coin
takes coin from her bag heads i go tails i stay to write the story
gazing nervously at the hand holding the coin
she flips and catches the coin
she holds it tightly clasped in her hand afraid to look
they stare at each other a second
nervously well what is it
almost breaking whats the difference
im going to write that story and you know it
she puts the coin away without looking at it
burns rushes to her tries to take her in his arms
furiously dont touch me
im not doing it for you
softly then why are you doing it
because im a newspaper woman heaven help me
city room hildy typing away furiously
copy boy tearing sheets from her typewriter as she writes
burns coming in and tearing sheets from typewriter
headline the post saves earl williams
headline post saves earl williams
over this sound of newsboys calling extra
camera draws back to rest of story impeachment proceedings launched against mayor for attempting to conceal governors reprieve
camera draws back further to the by line by hildegarde johnson
camera draws back still further to disclose burns and hildy looking at paper on burns desk
enthusiastically the greatest yarn ever written by anybody
my hats off to you hildy
and what a way to quit
while youre still champion
thats the way to leave hildy
only only im not leaving walter
what do you mean
brucell be waiting for you in albany
no he wont
i wired him that i wasnt coming
whered you wire him
on the nine oclock train
thats the one he took isnt it
its awfully clear now
bruce needs a wife who can give him a home and affection and peace
i couldnt do that for him walter
im what you made me a cheap reporter whod give up her soul for a story
is that job still open
both jobs are open hildy
the paper and being mrs
thanks walter but its no good
we tried it
sure it was good it was wonderful
only you expected it to be like other marriages
it cant be like other marriages were different
were a different world
look at what we went through today
i wouldnt trade that for any honeymoon in the world
i bet you wouldnt either
a fine honeymoon with a murderer right in the boudoir
and that other honeymoon in a coal mine
thats what makes it romantic
every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is and vice versa
but us you never know where i am and im not sure where you are
well maybe id like to know just once
hildy if thats what you want all right
well even go to how about niagara falls
jumping niagara falls
walter you dont mean that
sure i do
and ill tell you something else id like a baby
sure i cant last forever
i want a son i can train to take my place on this paper
what would you do if it was a daughter
well if she looked like you say
my brains and your looks that mightnt be such a bad combination
whats the matter with my brains
whats the good of arguing about something that probably doesnt exist
look hildy im proposing to you
what do you say
well id like to be lady like and think it over
i dont want to rush you
take a couple of seconds
louie marches in with a judge half dressed
louie has the judge in a tight grip
this is an outrage mr
sending a gunman to kidnap me
now wait a minute judge
this isnt a kidnapping
youve got the legal power to perform a marriage ceremony havent you
now dont argue hildy
to judge how about it judge
yes but then go ahead
come on hildy
nobodys going to rush me into anything
as louie sticks a gun in her ribs you keep away from me
but shes scared all right judge
reporters are standing on desks to watch through the glass partition of burns office
ill be doggoned
a shotgun marriage
dont they usually keep the gun on the man
reading the marriage ceremony
continuing so long as you both do live
thats what he said the last time
dont believe him judge
hildy from this time on no tricks no double crossing everything on the level
youre not fooling anybody
continuing hildegarde johnson will you have this man as your wedded husband to live together in the ordinances and estate of matrimony
what would you do with a gun in your back
poking her quiet
will you love him comfort him honor and keep him in sickness or in health if i know where he is
and forsaking all others keep thee only unto him so long as you both do live
i will if he will
to burns have you got a ring
burns starts searching his pockets then to hildy he takes ring off how about bruces
walter you cant do that
sure i can
look at the policy i gave him
placing bruces ring on hildys finger with this ring i thee wed and with all my worldly goods i thee endow and thereto i plight thee my troth
say im surprised she got the ring back
pronounce you man and wife
burns throws his arms around hildy and kisses her
yes hildy darling
im just a fool
thats what i am
i know what its going to be like
itll be heaven
youve probably thought up another coal mine to send me down in to get a new story for your paper
hildy turns over copy of the extra lying on burns desk
she stops cold
attempting to pass five hundred dollars worth of counterfeit money at the union station a man giving his name as bruce baldwin of albany new york was arrested last night
thats the money you sent me walter
you you starting to run but hildy listen burns retreats from hildy she runs after him
he dashes through glass paned door into adjoining office
hildy throws her bag at him and it smashes the glass pane in the door
she is pursuing him around table similar to one in burns office
but hildy i can explain you you
i think its going to work out all right this time
