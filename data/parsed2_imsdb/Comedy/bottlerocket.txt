they climb another fence
theres big house on the other side
anthony and dignan are inside walking through the foyer
anthony goes up the stairway quickly and quietly
dignan walks to the master bedroom
goes in the closet and grabs a box
dumps it into his bag
anthony goes into a bedroom
looks in a dresser and takes out two watches
digs through some socks and finds some cash
dignan goes in the study
opens a drawer and closes it
opens another and lifts out a set of thin leather coin books
anthonys in a kids room
looking at posters of a football player and john mcenroe on the walls
he grabs a walkman and a calculator
then suddenly stops moving
he crouches down
looks at a shelf of dozens of little metal soldiers
theyre in formations with different uniforms
dignan is walking down the hallway as anthony comes down the stairs
they walk to the door and go out
a twenty four hour diner
anthony and dignan are eating at the counter
did you see what i meant about the window
except weve already got the keys
but what if they change the locks
would they do that
thats why i filed it down
now that window can never be locked
see your mind is very good with the more mechanical details
whereas my strength would be a good looking woman about forty five years old interrupts them
can i use your tabasco
anthony hands her a bottle of tabasco off the counter
she walks away
down the counter
you dont see many women who like tabasco
they watch her for a minute
dignan looks away
shes really kind of hot
looks back at her nods shes an attractive older woman
a huge house with a wide lawn
bob whos about twenty six wearing black jeans and a v neck t shirt is spraying down a battered mercedes with a garden hose
hes got his shirt off and a towel around his neck
dignan has an expression of intense concentration as he looks at the car
well what do you think
i dont know bob
what about one of those
dignan points to a new bmw and a lexus in front of the garage
im not allowed to drive those
not even for emergencies
a little angry no
i thought your parents were in italy
so whos going to know
cause he looks like hes from the future
he looks like he was designed by scientists
for desert warfare
that never would of lets cut the bullshit
they all look at the car
its got a v dignan
what do you think the cops have
theyre sitting at the coffee table in bobs great big living room
its got high ceilings and two persian rugs
theyre eating sandwiches and chips
if youre that worried maybe we should just steal one

anthonys playing pinball at a machine in the back of a little grocery store
anthony well get two hundred for the coin collection alone
thats less than what its appraised at
but dignan do you really know that much about rare coins
i know about money anthony
i know the value of money
plus the earrings are worth three times that
anthony looks at dignan
dignan points at the pinball machine
dignan tries to hit the flipper
i told you not to take the earrings
anthony keeps looking at dignan
dignan doesnt look up from the machine
anthony turns and walks away
you got another ball
dignan watches him go
im playing your game
theyre walking fast down the sidewalk
the list dignan
i know you remember the list because you signed it
things dignan was not supposed to touch
every valuable item in the house was on that list
that doesnt make any difference
i bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday
they have a very special value for her
yeah but i cant be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary
theres just not time for it
then you shouldnt of gone in there dignan
maybe we should of robbed your house
did you ever think of that
dignan stops walking
anthony looks back at him
dignan turns and starts walking the other way
where are you going
i dont appreciate you ridiculing me
how was i ridiculing you
youre making fun of my family
you know theres nothing to steal from my mom and craig
you know exactly what youre saying
thats not what i meant dignan
they both see something
they keep walking
dignan looks back down the sidewalk

yeah i saw it
dignan its got an alarm
i dont think so
just reach on in
that sets it off
no just do it real quick

dignan cuts into an alley
anthony turns back
looks at a parked car
looks left and right
walks to the car and reaches in the half open window
an alarm goes off
anthony unlocks the door and opens it
grabs a wallet off the seat
a man standing on the sidewalk watches anthony get out of the car
anthony looks at him then walks down the sidewalk not too fast
he turns down an alley and runs
anthony comes around the corner and meets dignan beside a dumpster
the alarm is still ringing in the distance
anthony starts looking through the wallet
it had an alarm
yeah i heard that
counting the money five seven eight dollars
he looks at dignan
taking the wallet holy shit
whatd i tell you
thats not bad
anthony keeps looking at dignan
he hands anthony a five dollar bill
anthony looks at it
he takes it
he puts it in his pocket
dignan puts out his hand to shake
anthony waits a second
he shakes dignans hand for just a second and walks down the alley
dignan smiles and walks behind him
anthony and dignan are sitting at a table with bob
what do herbs have to do with it
i dont understand the pot is an herb
its just like any type of gardening
how much could you grow
as much as i want
when these plants bud ill probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed
six thousand dollars
come on bob
you should take a look
i have an entire crop in my backyard
in your backyard
how do you protect them
its private property
plus i have hector
hector woudnt do anything
but hes got a loud bark
thats the most important thing is a loud bark
if its that easy why doesnt everybody grow them
bob looks at anthony and dignan
he suddenly gets worried
dont you guys tell anybody about my plants
youre paranoid bob
yeah but dont tell anybody
could you grow cinnamon
i dont know
sure i guess
you could make your own cinnamon toast
bob looks at anthony for a second
he looks at dignan
back at anthony
are you a fag
youre the faggot
bob turns around to see little richard short but muscular wearing a down vest and a baseball cap
i dont believe it
theyll let anybody in this place
little richard sits down
dignan and anthony this is little richard
smiling i dont know about that
jesus this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk
you do not want a guy like that loose on the streets
it seemed like a good idea at the time
the one and only little richard
are you named after the little richard
stares at dignan ha
why dont you stick it up your ass
great group of guys youre hanging out with
little richard goes out the door
what was that all about
i cant believe you said that
what did i say
i told you hes crazy
but he didnt say anything
hang on a second
dignan gets up and walks out of the restaurant
anthony and bob look at each other
they start to get up
anthony and bob go out the door
dignan is walking over to a station wagon
little richard is getting in
wait a second
i didnt mean to little richard opens his door hard into dignans legs then gets out fast and takes off his shirt
dignan tries to hit him but doesnt connect
they grab onto each other and start knocking around
another guy gets out of the station wagon
two more guys rush out the door of the burger place
anthony and bob stand back nervous
let them fight
let them fight
they all watch
dignan keeps trying to punch little richard but hes hanging onto him too tight
they keep spinning around together moving down the sidewalk
calling out anthony
anthony looks at the other guys then moves toward dignan
break it up
break it up
little richard lets go of dignan
i separated my shoulder
dignan is holding onto his arm
he kind of moans
anthony grabs hold of dignans arm
just pull straight up
anthony pulls up hard on dignans arm
dignan tries not to yell then suddenly hes ok and relieved
is it back in
moving arm slowly yeah
im not fighting anymore
his shoulder went out man
you guys better get out of here
guy pushes dignan
anthony turns and pounds him in the face
right on the nose
the guy goes crosseyed
he falls down with his legs all tangled up in a strange position
everyone stands there stunned
anthony takes a step back
he looks up
he and dignan take off
bob stands there
everyone looks at him
bob looks at little richard
bob takes off
the next day
theyre driving with bob
dignans up front
hes banged up from the fight
the guy is fucking insane
i warned you dignan
you said it like it was a big joke bob
like hes wild
no i was saying crazy like a lunatic
i know that now
hes a fucking psycho
well dont blame me
i told you
i do blame you bob
look at her
theres a beautiful girl on the sidewalk
they drive past her
loop around real fast
just turn right here
bob immediately turns and they drive past the girl again
they dont say anything as they go past her
they all just look at her
they drive on
a minute later
theyve looped back
theyre looking for the girl
whered she go
maybe she turned
there she is
shes on a side street
bob hits the brakes hard
the girl looks back at them
they back up a few feet and turn down the street
they drive slowly toward the girl
bob dont be so obvious
the girl keeps looking back at them
i think we might of scared her
lets just go
they come up beside the girl
she looks right at them still walking
her expression is angry and also a little scared
they drive away
you blew it bob
anthony dignan and bob are meeting with temple
temple is in his mid fifties short heavy completely expressionless wide face
they listen intently as he briefs them on the intricacies of firearms
a gun is a firearm
a pistol is a firearm
but anything you hold in your hand is a weapon
a ballpoint pen
a ballpoiht pen
anyone who tells you a ballpoint pen is not a weapon needs intensive psychiatric treatment
you can stick them in the esophagus
you give them a ballpoint tracheotomy
they nod seriously
theyre standing behind temples car in the middle of an open pasture
the trunk is open
temples got some guns in metal cases
they draw targets on pieces of paper
anthony draws a man running on his target
they fire a bunch of different pistols
the last one they shoots a
they buy it
the tv room
there are two big couches and a nice giant tv
the doors are open onto the balcony
is on the coffee table
dignan is sitting there with a map and some diagrams laid out
anthony and bob are on either side of him
dignans pointing at a notebook page with the heading escape route
the most important thing you can have is an escape route
just in case somebodys tailing us
or even chasing us as the case may be you think were going to be chased
thats a good question
im just being hypocritical here
however i will say bob reaches for the
quietly im going to take a look at this
puts hand on gun hang on this is important bob
anthony and i are responsible for the internal situation
the money and the people
youre responsible for the external situation
the streets and the getaway
nods thats my responsibility
thats your domain
anthony is making a little man out of a scrap of paper
one thing we need to discuss is timing
timing is absolutely crucial
what are you doing
looks up nothing
bob picks up the gun
to himself how many bullets can that hold
dignan grabs the gun away and sets it down out of bobs reach
im paying attention
i just want to look at it for a minute
screaming whats your fucking problem
youre a shithead
i just want to see how much bullets it takes
anthony picks up the gun off the table
he clicks the action
anthony give me the fucking gun
pulling away no dignan
its not your gun
its all of ours
quietly i paid for it
dignan stands up grabbing his papers
you two just dont give a shit do you
dignan starts out of the room
anthony stands up
dignan calm down
turns back screaming youre out
im not working with either one of you
looking at anthony
take a deep breath
pause youre right
dignan sits back down and starts spreading out his papers again
looks at bob
bobs looking at the gun
bob looks at dignan
bob looks away
anthony and dignan have moved outside to the hot tub
anthony pets bobs dog hector
bobs brother future man walks up the path from the driveway with his blonde cheerleader girlfriend
what are you guys doing

future man goes inside
his girlfriend stands there on the deck
she stands there looking across the yard
anthony and dignan sit there in the hot tub looking around
we hear future mans loud voice inside goddammit bob

future man comes back out
he stops by the hot tub
what are you guys up to tonight

future man walks back out the gate
she follows future man
anthony and dignan watch them walk away
bob comes back out with some drinks
he looks shaken
whatd future man want
bob shrugs and gets in the hot tub
they sip on their drinks
bobs got a heineken
he doesnt get it
held never understand what were trying to accomplish here
its too dangerous for him
well in reality its not that dangerous bob
its only dangerous if you dont know what youre doing
yeah but what if some nut pulled gun on you
the only nut with a gun is going to be dignan
anthony gets out of the hot tub and dives in the pool
whispering very serious you know bob anthony did kill someone
he electrocuted our janitor senior year
he electrocuted someone
it was an accidental
i dont want to go into the details
it was just one of those senior pranks that didnt really go right
i mean obviously since swiftys dead
thats why anthony never graduated
his name was swifty
one of the nicest old guys youd ever know
thats too bad
nods you know when somebody gets electrocuted their skin starts smoking
at least swiftys did
anthony dignan and bob are sitting in bobs car parked in the dark
bobs at the wheel
anthony and dignan are in the back
anthony has on a dark blue ski cap
dignans wearing a baseball cap with the brim pulled down low
he puts a piece of adhesive tape across his nose and hands the roll to anthony
what are you doing
im putting a piece of tape on my nose
anthony tapes his nose
they stare out the windshield
the alarm on dignans digital watch goes off
immediately dead serious lets get lucky
anthony and dignan walk through the shadows in front of a huge bookstore
the lights are on inside
they watch for a minute and then go to the front door
dignan hides behind a post
anthony knocks on the glass
an employee appears
i left my sweater inside
the employee shakes his head
he cant hear through the glass

the employee unlocks the door and opens it an inch
i left my sweater in there

dignan points the gun at the employee
where is he
where is rob
i dont know
maybe in literature
thats his section

the manager is locking the door of his office
is that the manager
to manager unlock that door
to anthony check the aisles
anthony starts walking through the store checking down each aisle
he picks up a copy of the air war on hitlers germany and takes it with him
he goes through literature and sees rob in travel kneeling in front of a low shelf with a carton of books beside him
looks up a little puzzled uh huh
why arent you in literature
hesitates its all full up
dignan is in the office with the manager and the first employee
hes pointing at a drawer

the manager opens it
its full of office supplies

the manager opens the other drawer
its full of cash
dignan looks at the manager
he looks back at the cash

dignan points at some bookstore bags
the manager picks up a little one and starts to put the money in it
a bigger one you idiot
glares at dignan dont call me an idiot you punk
but that bags too small
anthony waiting outside the office door
rob the first employee and the manager are sitting against the wall in the office
the managers got an intense angry look on his face staring at dignan
dignan hands anthony five little bags full of money and starts to close the office door
dignan closes the door
anthony and dignan jump into the car
anthony and dignan keep looking back out the rear window
nobody says anything for a block or two
slow down bob
this is natural
looks at speedometer thats good
keep it at forty

quickly make that light
they keep driving
we got it
we got it
how much is there
dont count it
a picnic table in front of a hamburger place
dignan is standing up with his drink in his hand
was dignan screaming like get me a bag
i was calm
what about what that guy said
that was scary
in the middle of the robbery
the manager looks at me
right in the eye
and goes im going to remember you
are you serious
he said that
i swear to god
in a very quiet voice
like he meant it
like he would find dignan
like im going to hunt you down and kill you
dignan stands there a minute and lets this sink in
then he finally sits down and they all eat their burgers
you really think hell remember you
all hell remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose
they laugh smugly
anthony dignan and bob come out of a
bobs got a slurpee
hes carrying the wwii book
see you bob
hang on bob
dignan goes up to bob and hugs him
bobs not smiling
that was really good driving
i mean it
bob nods and starts walking away down the sidewalk
well see you later bob
anthony and dignan sit on the curb
anthonys drinking a milk
dignans still watching bob walk alone down the sidewalk
whats wrong with him
what do you think
anthony he sat in the car and watched a in progress
he got what he deserved
he was the driver dignan
he did what hes supposed to do
i didnt realize you were so sensitive to bobs feelings
considering i did the plans youre actually lucky you got dont even say it man
dignan and anthony are following bob through his house
bob is playing his electric guitar not plugged in
bob will you please listen
i dont want to talk about it
bob strums more intensely
theyre walking through the kitchen
look i admit i was wrong for not telling you before the robbery that your share wouldnt be as equal as ours
but the fact remains me and anthony were much more exposed to danger
bob has now come to the big glass patio doors where hector sits outside looking in
bob keeps playing as he looks at hector
i mean jesus christ bob
you didnt have some vicious lunatic screaming im going to remember you
smiles slightly keeps playing thats true
that would give me nightmares
bob ive got nightmares
bob stops playing
he looks at dignan
youll probably have them the rest of your life
what was that
anthony opens the door to the patio
they hear breaking glass somewhere as they follow anthony onto the patio
a voice yells out
whats going on
bob sets down his guitar as they go out of the yard to see whats happening
anthony dignan and bob go around to the front
bobs neighbor phil runs down the driveway with a wrench in his hand
phil is short and heavy wearing a golf shirt
hes got a bloody nose
ill kill him
looks around suddenly concerned who
phils girlfriend comes running out the front door
ive called the police
oh my god phil
she reaches to hug him
dont touch me
i swear to god ill get that guy
i know you will phil
there was nothing you could do
all you had was a golf club
youre bleeding man
a couple of neighbors have come over from across the street
some black man beat phil up
he didnt beat me up
he attacked me
he took two hundred dollars
to phil tilt your head back
its dark out now
theres a police car parked across the street and another pulling over lights rolling
one of the officers walks across the yard shining a flashlight in the bushes
dignan is talking with one of the other officers
he was probably on drugs
they usually are
two other cops are getting a statement from phil
anthony and bob are listening
some neighbors are milling around talking
as soon as i opened the door i saw him
a black guy
looking through my dads tool box
i wanted to trap this guy
so i closed the garage door
and thats when he hit you
looking up to sky and concentrating he struck me
i fell down
he took my wallet
then he opened the garage door and ran away
howd the window break
i hit it with the golf club
dignans still talking to the other cop
how long do you have to go
and what does that cover
hand to hand combat
dignan suddenly looks toward bobs backyard
the cop nods
did you hear that
anthonys looking up into the treetops
what the fuck is dignan doing with that cop
he loves them
theres a million places to hide around here
theyll never catch the guy
i hope not
phil probably provoked him
looking at dignan wheres he going
dignan and the officer are walking over to the backyard
no it was a rustling sound
look out for the dog
is this dog going to bite
dignan jumps the fence
the cop looks over and shines his flashlight
dignans petting hector
i dont know what hes talking about
bob starts walking across the street
where you going
as bob walks away he is looking back past anthony toward the backyard
anthony turns to look
in the backyard
dignan is looking in the bushes
he probably went into the next yard
shine the light over here
dignan looks across the yard at the officer
the officer is shining the light on the marijuana plants
he looks at dignan
dignan sprints across the yard and over the gate
anthony and bob are standing in the shadows across the street
they see dignan come racing down the driveway
the officer is yelling behind the gate
the other officers are running from their cars
the officers run past dignan toward the back
anthony and bob take off as dignan runs by
the three of them run full speed down the street cutting across yards between houses
they throw themselves over fences and scramble through bushes
way to go bob
i told you they were there
about to explode so its my fault
bobs at the wheel dignan in front anthony in the back
theyre driving fast down the interstate past fields and farmhouses
dignans drawing out a route in felt tip pen on a texaco roadmap
in all probability nothing would of happened
but why take the chance
thats why i ran
i mean how many plants were even back there
there were more than that
why dont you just tell them the truth
those belong to my neighbor phil
i dont know
i personally dont need that shit in my life right now
thats why we go on the road
the thing about cops is they have short attention spans
dignan fills up the tank and checks the oil
bob tests the tire pressure
anthony does the windows
can i get that credit card from you
pause i dont like to use that credit card dignan
because my mom gets the bill
shes not going to notice anthony
i dont want to use it
pause well then cut it in half
i keep it for emergencies
anthony were on the run
this is an emergency
its only fair that
anthony gets in the car
dignan reaches into his pocket and takes out a wad of cash
he counts some
stands there a minute
goes inside to pay
anthony stretches out across the backseat on pillows playing electronic football
dignan reads bobs wwii book
bob eats a ding dong and smokes a cigarette
a fireworks stand on the side of the highway
the cars pulled over and theyre buying roman candles m s and black cats from a kid wearing a baseball cap way back on his head
as they get back on the highway anthony lights a roman candle and fires it from the window
dignan lights an m and throws it out of the car
they drive to a big lake
a dog splashes in and swims for a tennis ball
anthony does some nice dives
dignan swings from a rope out over the water and lets go
bob sits on a bench
theyre driving on the interstate
anthonys got a copy of runners world magazine
heres mine right here
anthony lifts up his foot so dignan can compare his shoe with the picture
see if mine are in there
looks at dignans shoes dignan those arent running shoes
yes they are
look at the treads on those
what about them
they obviously werent designed for racing
well those treads stink
youd blow a knee out racing on those
will you guys shut up
its like having two little kids in the car
but seriously anthony
these are fast shoes
youve never had a pair of fast shoes in your life dignan
to bob in fifth grade dignan used to wear cowboy boots for p
thats real cool anthony
yeah i wore boots
my parents wouldnt buy me any running shoes like yours
i wasnt spoiled
dont call me spoiled dignan
you were spoiled rotten
anthony and dignan are lined up to race on the side of the road
yelling you want to say it bob
fifty yards away bobs sitting on the hood of the car parked on the shoulder
hes reading a magazine
he shakes his head without looking up
ill just say it
ill say it
on your marks
waits a second says very fast get set go
they take off
dignan has the jump but anthony pulls past him
a car blows by going the other way and they keep racing
anthonys out in front as they pass bob sitting on the car
dignan raises his fists into the air
points at anthony you owe me fifty bucks
bob gets in the car
bob wasnt even looking
a holiday inn
bobs car is parked in front
inside dignan bob and anthony are checking in
theres a teenage girl behind the counter
dignan pays cash
the girl hands over the keys
shes looking at dignans shirt was that shirt made from a towel
seeing his reaction its just terrycloth isnt it
i think so
theyre walking along the balcony looking for their room
anthony has on his backpack
dignans got his tennis bag
bobs got two large suitcases a carry on and a garment bag
she didnt know anything about shirts
no im not saying her
im just saying i dont know
its a great shirt
dont worry about it
they find the room and unlock the door
driving in a small town
bobs behind the wheel
dignans in front
anthonys in back
armored trucks are very difficult to steal anthony
but once you get inside youre home free
get back to me on that one
once your plan is worth a shit
its not a plan
its just actually
if you knew the exact route you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over
yeah but you wouldnt have the truck if you blew it up
theres a car stopped in front of them
a couple of girls are standing beside it talking to the driver
bob cant get around
what the fuck is this
dignan leans over and holds down the horn for about five seconds
the guy in the car sticks hi s hand out the window and shoots the finger at them
dignan sounds dead serious ram him bob
bob waits for a nervous moment
he does two quick honks
the guys reverse lights go on
bob hits the gas and slams into the car
he puts his car in reverse and backs up a couple of feet
he leans forward and sees the back of the guys car
its all smashed up
the guy gets out of his car shaken up and looks at them
his expression is confused
bob punches it and flies backwards down the street
the guy stands beside his car and watches them
what the fuck did you do that for
he wouldnt move
they go around the corner
bob shifts into first and goes
is he chasing us
i dont know
speed up bob
theyre unlocking the door
they go inside
you think he got my license plates
he looked too shaken up
im sure he did
well have to get new plates
its registered in my mothers name
shakes his head what the fuck possessed you
youre the one who kept saying ram him
dignans walking into the bathroom
i meant tap him
as a warning
dignan closes the door
anthony lies down on one of the beds
bob just stands there
the next day
dignan and bob are still asleep
bobs on a folding bed
anthonys sitting at the table reading a newspaper eating some cereal from one of those little boxes where you cut open the sides
ahthonys swimming laps
he stops and hangs onto the side for a minute
across the pool he can see a good looking mexican maid about twenty years old standing beside her cart looking at him
she waves and gets back to work
a little while later
anthonys sitting in a chair by the pool letting the sun dry him off
hes wearing just a swimsuit
dignan and bob are fully dressed standing beside him
dignan i cant get my hair cut
thats just not possible all right
then youre going to have to dye it anthony
weve got to hide our identities
especially after bob crashed the car
bob has no reaction to this
i cant do that
even if its the difference between some trooper recognizing us and throwing us in prison or not
well bob samson has decided that his hair is more important than our safety
screaming my friend that is a reckless decision
lets go bob
dignan starts walking away
are you coming
see you in a little while
see you bob
anthonys wearing a bathrobe sitting on one of the beds
the maid unlocks the door and looks inside
she sees anthony and starts to go back out
no its ok
come on in
she goes in and starts cleaning up
anthony sits down in one of the chairs and makes conversation
its hot out isnt it
this is a nice little town
so what do you do all these rooms yourself
he puts out his hand
she shakes it
whats your name
let me give you a hand with that
he helps her make the beds
anthony walks with inez from room to room helpinq her clean up
how do you say nineteen
dies y nueve
yo soy dies y nueve
how old are you
inez opens the door to one of the room
they go in to clean it
are you ever scared of finding a dead body in one of these rooms
it could happen
this is the exact kind of place where it happens
but i dont want to scare you
anthony picks up a magazine off somebodys suitcase
he flips through it
inez takes it out of his hands and puts it back on the suitcase
inez is putting a new bar of soap in the shower
anthony picks up some wet towels off the floor
its cramped in there
people think because theyre in a hotel they can act like a slob
its bad manners
inez takes the towels
she pulls the shower curtain shut
were you born in mexico
do you prefer cuba or the united states
inez is trying to get out of the bathroom but anthonys in the way
inez is pushing the cart
anthony has his hand on the cart
these towels are still warm
he picks one up and holds it to his face
i guess from the dryer
he hands the towel to inez
she holds it to her face
ive never met anybody from cuba before
inez says a few sentences of very fast spanish
inez knocks on the door of a room
a woman about thirty five years old opens the door
were just checking out
the woman goes back into the room
inez follows her
the womans packing a bag on the bed
anthony comes in
the woman looks at him
hes about to say something when anthony takes the liner out of the trashcan
the womans husband comes out of the bathroom
anthony picks up some stuff off the floor
anthony follows inez into the bathroom
the husband looks at his wife
diqnans sitting in the waiting area of a barbershop reading a newspaper
we can see bob out the window talking on a pay phone
he hangs up and comes inside
you can go first bob
my brothers in jail
what are you talking about
theyre standing next to the spinning striped pole
but its not his
how can they arrest future man
they said hes a drug dealer
bob looks off into the distance
we got rapes
violent crimes every second
and this is what they come up with
shaking his head theyre just fucking him because hes from a prominent family
theyre sitting at a table waiting for their order
i dont think they can make it stick bob
i mean what do they actually have on future man
well the marijuana crop is a good start
that could be anybodys
they also found my two beam scale in the garage
since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house
everybody has a scale
the cops say its a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana
so tell them the truth
what do you use it for
pause i was just going to use it to see how much i had
dignan mulls this over for a minute
how long has he been in there
i dont know
then how come they havent set the bail yet
well have to see when we get back
dignan looks at bob for a minute
what do you mean get back
pause well obviously we got to go back
bob that makes no sense
dignan hes my brother
i cant just leave him there
this could be a trap
come on dignan
dont come on dignan me
im going back
louder not in that car youre not
good luck since i got the keys
bob glares at dignan
the waitress brings over some glasses of water ice clinking
nobody says anything while she sets them down
she walks away
give me the keys dignan
i cant do that bob
youre going to give me those keys or youre going to get hurt
dont threaten me bob
its my car
if you dont give me my keys i swear to god dignan drives the car slowly alongside bob walking down the sidewalk staring straight ahead
dignans got his window down
i understand your loyalty
youre a good person
but right now youre not using your best judgement
bob keeps walking
future man would not want you to go to jail i promise you
just get in the car and well talk about it
bob keeps walking straight ahead
future man would never go to jail for you ill tell you that
his names not future man dignan
i know its not
you dont even know his name
yes i do
what is it
just get in the car bob
whats his name
i dont know his name
you know why
because i dont care
hes future man
but i care about you
and to me it doesnt make sense to go back to the scene of a crime
will you get in the car bob
this is stupid
bob stops walking
its not your decision and hes not your brother dignan
i only have one vote
well go talk with anthony and figure it out
bob gets into the backseat
dignan looks back at him for a minute
youre going to ride in the back
bob nods and looks out the window
come on bob
get in front
bob exhales and gets out
he gets in up front
dignan looks at him for a minute
youve got a beautiful walk bob
dignan and bob open the door and go in
inside inez and two other hispanic maids are sitting at the table by the window
ones about seventeen and a little heavy the others in her mid thitties
theres a bunch of glasses and a bottle of rum on the table
one of the maids is cutting up a banana
inez smiles at dignan
dignan looks puzzled
hows it going
suddenly theres a loud crunching grinding sound
dignan and bob are startled
they look around the room
the sound stops
anthony comes out of the bathroom carrying the pitcher from a blender
its full to the top with yellow liquid
he sees dignan and bob and stops
i thought you guys went to get your hair cut
were making banana daqueris
anthony holds up the pitcher
dignan looks at it
this is inez
inez this is jerry
pointing to bob and this is my associate cornelius
a strange expression crosses bobs face
may i have a word with you please
outside the room
dignan closes the door
theres three housekeeping carts in the hall
what the fuck is going on here
whats the matter
anthony were on the run from the law here
did you tell these people your real name
dignan they dont speak english
inez speaks a little
which one was that
on the left
dignan cracks open the door and looks inside
shes from cuba
closes the door anthony
they walk around the motel
how long are they going to hold him
i dont know
i dont know anything
except phil says they got him
and hes in jail
he needs to hire an attorney
lets stay here until we find out whats going on
anthony i and if future man doesnt get let out of jail in hours then we go back
now that makes sense
well hang out for a couple of days
get a little r r
make sure future mans ok and then get back on the road
as long as he gets out ok
thats a given
is that ok
bob looks at dignan
looks at anthony
i guess so
they shake hands and start back to the room
see now weve got a plan
dont worry about it bob
anthony dignan inez carmen and anita are sitting crowded around the little table by the window in the motel room
theyve got banana daqueris and a bottle of wine
moonlight comes through the window
bob is standing up in front of them with a banana daqueri in his hand
hes singing a blues number acapella
hes got a good voice
dignan and bob are playing slapjack with carmen and anita
everyones got their hands ready as carmen turns one card then the next
bobs having a conversation in fluent spanish with them about las vegas
hes talking about the rules at different casinos ballys caesars the desert inn
dignans paying close attention to the deck
a jack comes up and he slams it
theres a light in the pool
anthony and inez are swimming
anthony swims around her with his eyes just above the water
he goes under and comes up grabbing onto her
does my skin feel soft anthony
passionate god yes
inez starts to giggle
starts laughing what
that does sound corny
oh your skin feels so soft and silky
but it really kind of does
he kisses her
no lifeguard on duty
swim at your own risk
they look up
dignans standng at the other side of the pool
you know i did save anthony from drowning once inez
tell her anthony
dignan sitting with his feet in the pool
anthony and inez are sitting on the steps beside him in the shallow end
see one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor mr
langstons house and anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious
i had to dive in and save him
this was in fourth grade
langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation
ive never said this before but frankly i thought anthony was dead
the veins in his face were all sticking out
his skin was blue
he truly did look dead
after that my parents never let me go to dignans again
they blamed my family for everything
they always said mr
langston saved anthonys life
dignan stares wistfully across the pool
anthony looks at him for a minute
but if it wasnt for dignan i probably would of died
nodding whisper voice yes
theyre all quiet for a minute
inez hangs onto the side
bobs sitting in the room by himself close to the tv watching a war movie
the next morning
dignan bursts out the door of the motel room
he runs across the parking lot
son of a bitch
dignan runs back into the room
he comes out with anthony
he stole the car
where was it parked
anthony looks around the parking lot
son of a bitch
maybe he just went to the store
he took his stuff
pause i should of seen this
i should of expected it
bob doesnt have any character
anthony puts his hands in his pockets
looks out at the highway
he went back for his brother
we said hours
thats a long time to be in jail
they stand there in the empty parking lot
anthony goes inside
in the room
the blinds are pulled
anthonys sitting at the end of a bed
dignans pacing around the room
well get him
dont worry about that
well go back
well find him
and well blow up his car
or do something
i promise you
anthony gets up and walks to the bathroom
he shuts the door
dignan follows him over to the sink and sits on the counter
i mean lets face it
bob was dead weight
were a lot better off without him
pause but who could expect it
just like that
steals the fucking car
what kind of person pulls that anthony opens the door and walks out
bob didnt steal the car
he told me he was going
he had to go help his brother
anthony sits back down on the bed
whend he tell you
where was i
you were asleep
he told you and you let him do it
he told me because he wanted to know if i wanted to go
hesitates if you wanted to go
what were you going to do
just leave me here by myself
well i didnt do it did i
so when you were saying bobs at the store and acting real suprised that was just an act
you were just bob went to help his brother
i understand that and i cant help it if you dont
i understand that if i had a few more friends like you and bob id be dead
if you say so
anthony and dignan are sitting at a booth
anthonys got a roadmap spread out on the table
theres a long silence
if youd gone with bob youd probably be in weatherford by now
of course id be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped
i didnt realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself dignan
well the world is a little bit colder today
anthony sits there thinking for a second stating into space
then he looks back at his map
he draws some lines in two different colors of felt tip pens
you want to look at the map
dignan kind of looks at the map without leaning forward
anthony turns the map more in dignans direction
dignan leans forward looking
heres where we are
they look at the map for a minute
dignan looks out the window
i didnt know he had it in him
pause i guess you could say the child has become the father of the man
anthony runs down the sidewalk cuts across the street and goes around the side of the motel
he pulls off his jacket as he goes up the stairs
he spots inezs cart
he walks over to the room shes cleaning
shes in there making the bed
anthony closes the door and grabs her by her belt
shes laughing and he pushes her onto the bed
he unbuttons her dress
she jerks a sheet out of the way
it swings in the air
then we see anthony and inez walking down the sidewalk
hes got one arm wrapped tight around her shoulders and shes got hers around his waist
theyre talking while they walk going past people in the town
they watch each other walking reflected in a window
dignan is doing the butterfly in the pool
anthony and inez walk over and wait for him at the end of the pool
were going over to this bar if you feel like going
im going to swim
ill see you later
dignan treads water
inez looks at anthony
why dont you come with us
dignan gets out of the pool
anthony dignan and inez are drinking beers with limes and salt
the mood is good and theyre getting drunk
anthony and inez dance
then dignan and inez
mexican style stomping their feet and clapping
theres a scruffy dog in the bar and he barks at the dancers
anthony kisses inez and they whisper to each other
dignan orders another beer and moves over to the pool table
a skinny mexican man puts his arm around dignans shoulder
hes drunk and slurring his words
hello my friend
you in the army yes
i just have short hair
is that your chiquita
no my friend knows her
she chicano yes
you like chicanos
he says something in fast spanish to the people at his table and they smile
for one cerveza
the guy racks up the balls
they start shooting
dignan makes a hard shot
smiling you a good pool player
got a little lucky
wheres your friend
he go with the chiquita
dignan looks over to the bar
anthony and inez are gone
i dont know
she is a good looking woman
dignan ignores this
they keep playing
dignan finally makes the eight ball
the man shakes dignans hand and holds on
guess ill get another tecate
you like to fight
he pulls dignan in and with his other hand fakes a hard punch
pulls away fuck you
you a hoto
me no hoto
the bathroom is very small with one bare light bulb
dignan stands at the urinal muttering to himself
the door opens and dignan turns around just in time to see the mexican man throw a hard punch
he hits dignan in the stomach punches him in the face
dignan goes down hard
the guy kicks him and curses in spanish
the bartender comes in with a bat in his hand and starts talking fast and angry in spanish
the guy gets out
dignans sitting in bed watching tv
hes got a fat lip and a big bruise over his eye
anthonys sitting in a chair beside him
inez brings over a glass of water and some ice in a washcloth
she gives the ice to dignan for his eye
she puts the glass of water on the nightstand where theres some fast food layed out for dignan burger fries an apple pie
inez goes into the bathroom closes the door and turns on the water
anthonys sitting there with his hands clasped not looking at the tv
i cant believe he just jumped you
can you hand me those french fries
anthony hands him the fries
dignan watches the tv
i wish id been there
would of been nice
anthony looks at dignan
we just went for a walk i dont really feel like talking about it
the only thing i feel like is getting the fuck out of this place
pause we need a car
for the first time dignan looks away from the tv at anthony
i have an idea for that
inez has a master key to all these rooms doesnt she
pause doesnt she
i dont think we can do that
i know we can
its real simple
we go into a room grab some car keys and what im saying is she wouldnt go for that
she doesnt need to know
pause i dont know dignan
i just look
im ready to get the fuck out of here
its real torture for me to be here
getting the shit kicked out of me by mexicans
no one to back me up
now i have a good idea
so unless you come up with something better dignan
i cant do that
i just cant
the bathroom door opens
then you better think of something
inez comes back in
how are you jerry
staring at tv i feel great inez
kisses her ill see you later
inez goes outside
she closes the door
i dont think we need any keys dignan
i think i can hotwire a car for us
you dont know how to hotwire
yes i do
bob taught me
bob taught you how to get electrocuted
no im serious
he made me a diagram
dignans standing on a corner alone
he looks sullen
anthony walks down an alley
he goes past a beat up convertible
he stops hands in his pockets
he looks both ways
he cuts back to the car opens the door and slips inside
anthonys behind the wheel
he hand signals a turn and pulls up next to dignan
dignan shakes his head as he looks at the car
he gets in
they drive through the town
the winds blowing hard
anthony smiles at dignan
dignan tries not to smile
dignan sitting in the parked car with the motor running
in the side mirror hes watching anthony and inez
anthonys saying goodbye
he walks back to the car and gets in
he puts it in gear and they drive off
whatd you say to inez
ill come back for you
i love you inez
anthony is silent
im going to take you away from all this windexing and making beds
dignan exhales and looks out the window
the car is on the shoulder raised up on a jack with the hood open
anthonys looking underneath the car
dignans standing in the middle the road with his hands in his pockets
no cars in sight
anthony starts messing around under the hood
he tests some wires and connections
he steps away from the car
man i dont know anything about cars
dignan stares down the road
you really know how to pick them
anthony walks over to dignan
he stands beside him for a minute
i think we better go home
dont panic anthony
but theres you cant just run home every time things get tough
first of all weve got enough dough to our money situation is not good
clapping him on the back youre so spoiled
what is not good to you
only a few hundred weve got sixteen dollars
thats not correct
dignan stares at anthony
give it to me
anthony reaches into his pocket and pulls out the money
dignan takes it
he counts it
he looks at anthony
wheres the rest
dignan stares at anthony
i had to give some to inez
dignan frowns slightly
he screams what
dignan runs at the car and kicks the door as hard as he can
it makes a big dent
he runs down the shoulder and grabs a big rock
he runs at the car and smashes the rock through the windshield
he stands still
he turns to anthony
he walks back over to him yelling
you gave to the goddamn housekeeper
what the fuck is your problem
she needed it
for the housekeeper
her names inez
stop calling her the housekeeper
thats what she is
i know that
but youre in love with the fucking housekeeper
what are you going to do get married
have a bunch of little idiot janitor brats
and go around scrubbing the anthony slaps dignan hard in the face
pause now listen to me
dignan punches anthony is the face
follows it up with one after another
anthony ducks and puts his arms out
he falls on one knee
dignan immediately turns and walks to the car
anthony stands up
hes got a bloody nose
he stares at dignan
dignan pulls his tennis bag out of the car
he shuts the door and walks down the highway
anthony walks to the car and takes out his backpack
he pulls it tight around his shoulders
he looks down the highway at dignan
then turns and walks the other way into the distance
a cold day on a nice country club course
anthony watches bob hit a hard slide straight into the rough
bob stands there in a frozen follow through
then he suddenly swings his club and hums it down the fareway
he starts to walk back to the golf cart
bob where you going
im not playing any more golf
cause im not getting any better
its a waste of time
youve only been playing for two weeks bob
it takes a long time to learn this game
you think im improving
you just got to stick with it
bob looks down the fareway
he takes a deep breath and starts walking toward his club about twenty yards away
in the cart
theres a brief silence
you dont have to talk about it if you dont want to
no i dont mind
i know it must of been a bad experience
but it doesnt sound like it was your fault
well i didnt mean to electrocute him
but the whole operation was my idea
montage electronics wizardry
a filament lights up blue
pliers and clippers rewire a circuit breaker short out the p
system electrify doors and windows
anthony continues in voiceover
it took six months of research
i did all the wiring myself
switched ac to dc
doubled the voltage
shorted out the generator
the whole school was shut down
thats pretty complicated for a senior prank
i dont like that word prank bob
i was trying to do something more than a prank
a large school building
tall oak trees and benches in the shade
green and blue lights blink in the windows
white flashes and loud jolts of energy dance from room to room
mozart plays in the distance
students begin to swarm out into the yard
i wanted to create an event
something everyone would remember
and at first it worked perfectly
the whole school was standing around outside
kids running all over the place
anthony and bob are standing on the seventeenth green
even the school custodian swifty thought it was great
he kept laughing and shaking his head the whole time he tried to disconnect the generator
and then suddenly snaps his finger total silence except for swifty hanging off the generator with his leg stuck to it being electrocuted
anthony stares down the fareway
actually he died of a heart attack brought on by the shock
he was an older guy
anthony and bob are driving back to the clubhouse
i felt terrible
id known swifty since first grade
he was dignans medicine man for indian guides
they called each other rattlesnake and killer whale
whenever dignan came to visit me he would act like he and swifty werent that good of friends but that was just to make me feel better
the whole rest of the school had turned against me
anthony and bob are sitting by the pool drinking beers
future mans swimming laps even though its cold out
at first they were going to charge me with manslaughter
thats partly why i was in custody so long
one minute youre studying great expectations and the next minute youre drawing the holy mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend
why were you drawing the holy mary
i got to be pretty good
its not like drawing on paper
future man toweling off
he wears a speedo swimsuit
he walks over to bob and anthony
anthonys just finishing a drawing of a leaping jungle cat in black and red ink on bobs shoulder
future man stops and looks at them with no feeling
pause its a panther
future man looks at bob
hows that bucks coming
im working on it
hard to find it sitting by the pool drinking beer and bullshitting
he walks inside
i thought he didnt have to pay anything because of the technicality
yeah but he still has the aggravation
three days sitting in a cell
pause were you adopted bob
why do you say that
well because you guys dont look alike
i wasnt adopted
was future man adopted
dignan and applejack are sitting in a monte carlo by the curb two houses down from bobs
applejack is a small black man with white hair
its hard to tell exactly how old he is
around sixty five
theres a lot of valuable shit in there applejack
the silver and the china
and the grandfather clock
goddammit i bet that clocks worth ten grand
why the fuck do we need to blow up the car
it doesnt make any goddamn sense
just settling an old score
you might say revenge
that sounds like a lot of bullshit thatll land us in jail
we might have to take that chance
cause i feel pretty strongly about this
is that buckethead
anthony is walking hector down the driveway
anthony does some stretching exercises in the driveway
is that him
wait a second
they watch anthony and hector start down the street
thats your friend anthony
whats he doing here
looks like hes staying with buckethead
thats what i figured
hes probably got his own room
lets see where hes going
applejack puts the car in gear
they drive slowly
dont get too close
anthony looks back
he saw us
anthony keeps jogging with hector
did he see us
were going too slow
it looks like were following him
anthony goes around a corner down an alley
they pull down to the end of the alley
anthony and hector are racing down the alley
dignan gets out of the car
anthony looks back
he stops running
dignan jogs down the alley
he stops a few feet away from anthony
where you going
anthony points down the alley
just walking hector
dignan looks down the alley
he looks at anthony
whend you get back
couple days ago
under his breath you want to shake hands
anthony puts his hand out
anthony looks down the alley
whos in the car
you want to meet him
they walk to the car
this is applejack
nice to meet you applejack
i hear youre a good thief
anthony shrugs and smiles
a hamburger place with no other customers
anthony dignan and applejack are sitting at an outdoor table
its cold and their jackets are zipped up tight
im just sitting at this bar drinking my drink when this fine chick walks by
she was a living doll
and the big motherfucker who came in with her sees me looking when he walks by he steps on my foot
doesnt say shit
just takes a seat with his lady
well i holler out to him if i was as big as you aint no way in the hell youd of stepped on my foot like that
he just laughed
he says little man take your foot and put it in your pocket
i said no how about i take my foot and i stick it up your ass
man we went to war right there
i hit him so hard i knocked his nuts in his watchpocket
but this motherfucker wouldnt go down
then all the sudden out of nowhere dignan came up behind him and smashed a bottle on his head
and that big old boy went down
thats how i met dignan
good cat to have on your side
hell go to war with you
he dont give a fuck
applelack and dignan slap hands
applejack would of got him anyway
this was just the quicker war
you really hit a guy with a bottle
dignan takes a little notebook out of his pocket
he kind of fell into me
but wait a second
dignan opens the notebook on the table
i want you to look at this
what is it
its big anthony
its called hinckley cold storage
whats hinckley cold storage
anthony dignan and applejack are standing in front of a massive structure with ladders and towers and huge doors
applejacks car is parked behind them

anthony dignan and applejack are standing on the sidewalk at the front door of an old warehouse
dignan knocks on the door then tries the bell
they all wait
what time did he say to be here
dignan looks in the window
he tries the door
i can knock a man out with a six inch punch

anthony puts his hand up
applejack does a short hard jab
anthony shakes his hand out
whistles you could give somebody a concussion

dignan puts his hand up
applejack nails it
grabbing his hand ow
a drop of water hits dignan on the head
he looks up
more water falls on him
he gets out of the way
everyone looks up
theres a man on the roof
he laughs hysterically
they stare up at him
hows the weather down there
come on in
no its not
he goes over to the door
henry pours some more water on him
a minute later a steel garage door opens and the man steps outside
he is tall about sixty years old with white hair clipped short and a trim goatee
he wears black trousers black shoes no shirt and a string of animal teeth around his neck
this is mr
he puts a towel around dignans shoulders and pats him on the back
good to see you

henry points to rowboat a tall older black man standing in the doorway
rowboat wears a white windbreaker
this is my business manager rowboat
nice to meet you
thats a sharp jacket
the second floor of the warehouse is one huge room painted all white
henry and anthony are playing ping pong
rowboat and applejack are on the far side of the room playing chess
its hard to get much spin with this kind of paddle
its called a racquet anthony and youre holding it wrong
thats ghetto play
hold it like this
anthony changes his grip
the ball clicks back and forth
theyre both solid players
anthony whips a shot crosscourt and wins the point
you know your form is for shit but youve got a hell of a talent
henry suddenly fires a scorching shot down the line
anthony watches it click past him
he looks to mr
he looks to dignan

anthony stands there silent
he looks to applejack and rowboat
he looks to mr

henry puts down his paddle
stares at anthony
lets go talk about cops and robbers
the ground floor is crammed with cars
some have been taken apart
some are shiny and perfect
anthony and dignan walk among the cars and junk with mr
theyve each got coffee in a styrofoam cup
every once in a while some cat comes to me
he wants to know how i made it
how did i become a success
the first thing i tell them is follow your instincts
let your instincts guide you
the second thing i tell them is for christs sake you got to know your grammar
what do you mean grammar

hes damn good
kumar is about sixty five with white hair
hes short and wears a pale green button down shirt dark trousers and sandals
his room is small and has everything he needs in it
possessions from all over the world
kumar sits on his bed
anthony and dignan sit in wooden chairs
kumar stares out the window
they sit for a long silence
so what do you think of the plan mr
wed love to have you on the team
he looks at a plant growing by the window
what is that
kumar shakes his head
kumar suddenly stands up and unbuttons his shirt
he throws it on the bed
he undoes his trousers and takes them off
anthony looks at dignan
kumar takes off his socks then his shorts
he is naked
he walks over to his dresser and takes out a small satchell
he looks around the room
right at anthony
he walks quickly toward him
anthony gets nervous
kumar grabs anthonys shoulder and lifts him up a little
he pulls a towel out from underneath anthony
he puts his hand on dignans shoulder as he walks to the door into the hall
he goes out
anthony and dignan sit there for a minute
theyre a little disoriented

nods he seems pretty good
the foyer of bobs house
the doorbell is ringing
bob walks in wearing a velour robe

dignans hidden in some bushes watching the hinckley cold storage building with binoculars
anthonys crouched beside him taking notes in a notebook
man in blue jeans just left by southwest door

we see the team assembled around a table
theyre drinking coffee and looking at pictures charts maps diagrams tools
dignan passes out some walkie talkies
they test out some smoke cannisters on the roof
dignan throws one down
they all run for cover
applejack and dignan drive fast through a slalom course in a deserted parking lot
we see kumar working on a safe
he wears a stethoscope and listens to the tumblers
he turns the dial
dignan is timing him with a stopwatch
kumar opens the safe
he looks at dignan
dignan nods with a serious expression on his face
anthony and mr
henry are jogging along railroad tracks in the warehouse district
anthony wears a blue t shirt and shorts
henry looks like a boxer in grey sweats with the hood up and a crisp white towel wrapped around his neck and tucked into his sweat top
hes wearing black chuck taylors
theyve both got smooth running styles though every twenty yards or so mr
henry rolls his shoulders and gives a quick flurry of punches
an older woman rides a bicycle across the tracks
shes not pretty but shes got a strong face
look at that woman
but she hasnt let herself go
i appreciate an older woman who has a commitment to her body
so do i
they watch her ride down the street

hes a great person and id call bullshit on anybody who said differently
but i wonder if the kid has the goods taps his temple up here
long pause i dont think youre giving him enough credit
i know sometimes he doesnt think an idea through
he gets too excited
but as far as i can tell he hasnt thought his life through
hed be fine cutting my grass or parking my car
looks at anthony you i can work with

dignans not going to make it
anthony stops running
henry stops ahead of him and looks back jogging in place
youre wrong about dignan
henry stops jogging in place

henry walks to anthony and puts his hand on his shoulder
anthony knocks it off

anthony takes a deep breath
henry massages anthonys shoulders
he takes anthonys head in his arms and does a quick pull to one side cracks his neck
then the other side

anthony rubs his hands on his neck and moves his head around
did dignan take the test
pause yes he did
howd he do
they start jogging again
well he agreed that bob should be dropped
and he also agreed you were a liability
but he felt his talent would make up for your weaknesses

anthony running down a sidewalk
he drops his gun in a trashcan without slowing down
he crosses a bridge and runs into the the trees
theres snow in the air
the prison yard is wide with dry grass and concrete
its split up by chain link fences
guards sit in the towers
dignans wearing an inmate jumpsuit

anthony and bob laugh
dignan takes another huge bite

bob and anthony slowly half smile
they wave to dignan as the line of inmates turns away
anthony looks to bob
the line of inmates stops about fifty feet away
dignan looks back
anthony looks at him
dignans expression has changed
he wasnt expecting them to see it
his eyes look cold
anthony puts his hand on the fence
dignan turns and the line of inmates disappears into the cell block
anthony stands there in silence
he lets go of the fence
he walks with bob down the long path in the cold air
