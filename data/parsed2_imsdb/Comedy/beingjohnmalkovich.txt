href b b being john malkovich a screenplay by charlie kaufman a screenplay by charlie kaufman the room is bare dusty
a ceiling fan turns
the wall clock ticks
craig years old and small sits at a collapsible card table
the only item on the table is a book
craig picks it up looks at the jacket
its entitled sit
craig opens the book
it reads sit sit sit sit sit
over and over page after page
craig closes the book
he begins to stand but thinks better of it sighs
he looks at the book again
it is now entitled die
he opens it up
die die die die die
a rooster crows
craig jolts awake
a rooster stands on craigs chest crowing
lotte also in the middle of dressing for work hurries in and pulls the bird from craigs chest
i didnt know orrin hatch was out of his pen
lotte leans down and kisses craig on the forehead
shipment of grub worms coming in first thing
craig listen honey ive been thinking
maybe youd feel better if you got you know a job or something
weve been over this
nobodys looking for a puppeteer in todays wintry economic climate
well you know maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around
bitterly the great mantini doesnt need a day job
sighs craig everyone cant be derek mantini
beat well grub worms are waiting
do me a favor
would you check in on elijah
he seems to be a little under the weather this morning
which one is elijah again
the place is a mess
vivaldi blasts through cheap speakers
a small marionette stage stands in the back of the garage
the stage is lit and on it is a finely sculpted puppet version of craig
the craig puppet paces back and forth wringing its hands with incredible subtlety
we see craig above and behind the stage
he is manipulating the puppet
his fingers move fast and furious
the puppet breaks into a dance a beautiful and intricate balletic piece
soon the puppet is leaping and tumbling through space moves that one would think impossible for a marionette
sweat appears on the real craigs brow
his fingers move like lightning
the puppet moves faster and faster
sweat appears on the puppets brow
we see that the sweat is being piped from a special device that the real craig controls
the craig puppet collapses on the floor of the stage
it puts its hands up to its face and weeps
craig hangs the puppet and comes down around the front of the stage
he is heaving
he switches off the music picks up a beer and takes a swig
the room is filled with penned and unpenned animals of all kinds snakes lizards birds a dog cats etc
craig sits on the couch and looks at the want ads the tv is on in the background
elijah the monkey sits next to craig holding his stomach and moaning weakly
on the tv derek mantini is working a foot high marionette from the top of a water tower
the assembled crowd is enthralled
the crowd is enthralled as derek mantini arguably the greatest puppeteer in the history of the world performs the belle of amherst with his foot emily dickinson puppet directed by
the inimitable charles nelson reilly
charles nelson reilly floats by in a hot air balloon
craig switches off the tv
he comes across an ad for a female puppeteer to teach at a girls school
craig rubs his chin in thought then stands with great determination
craig searches through lottes closet looking for the right dress
craig waxes his body shaves his face
craig paints his nails while he chats on the phone
craig pulls stockings and underwear from lottes drawer
craig picks a wig from a mannequin head on lottes dressing table
craig at the sewing machine is sewing padding to go onto his chest and around his hips
craig applies make up in the bathroom mirror
craig now looking very much like a woman admires himself in the full length mirror
craig hails a taxi in his get up
men on the street turn and leer at him
craig and the headmistress chat over tea
craig is quite animated and charming
the admiring headmistress smiles and nods her head in approval
craig instructs a class of uniformed girls
he draws complex diagrams of puppets on the blackboard
the students are transfixed except for one troubled girl who eyes craig sullenly from the back of the room as she plays with a switchblade
craig guides the hands of the troubled teenage girl who is trying to manipulate a marionette
the girl looks up at craig
her tough facade crumbles and she smiles
craig smiles back
the girls carry craig on their shoulders
everyone is joyous
craig leads the girls in a bike race
everyone is laughing and screaming
one of the girls notices that craig is riding a mans bike
craig sits in a holding cell with several other men
he is still in the dress but the wig is in his lap and the make up is smeared off
lotte appears with a cop outside craigs cell
the door is opened and craig lotte and the cop head down the hall
craig looks out the window
both are silent
finally is the trial date set
whyd you do it craig
im a puppeteer
they drive in silence
craig sits on the couch in his bathrobe and studies the want ads
he sees an ad for a company called womyn teers looking for an african american lesbian separatist puppeteer for community outreach
craig rubs his chin in thought stands with determination
craig applies a dark pancake make up to his face
craig pulls an afro style wig off a mannequin head on lottes dressing table
craig now made up to look like a black lesbian separatist hails a cab
women look at him longingly
craig dressed as the black lesbian and beaten to a pulp
sits in the passenger seat
finally why craig
through fat lip i
craig reads the paper
he comes across an ad female puppeteer wanted for nudist colony marionette staging of oh calcutta
craig rubs his chin
craig sits in the passenger seat
he is made up as a woman and wears a full body rubber naked woman suit
finally you know maybe you should speak to someone about this
craig sees a personal ad male puppeteer looking for attractive female puppeteer for friendship travel and much much more
craig rubs his chin then thinks better of it and sighs
he finds a want ad calling for a short statured file clerk with unusually nimble and dexterous fingers needed for speed filing
craig writes down the address
in sport coat and tie studies the business listings board
he finds lestercorp and sees that it is located on floor
craig presses the elevator button and waits
another man comes and waits next to him
the doors open and craig and the other man get in
the other man presses
craig studies the buttons
there is no
seven and a half right
ill take you through it
the man picks up a crowbar leaning in the corner
he watches the floor numbers light up in succession
after and before the man hits the emergency stop button
the elevator slams to a halt
the man pries open the doors with the crowbar
revealed is a standard office building hallway except that from floor to ceiling it is only about four feet high
everything is scaled down accordingly
the number on the wall across from the elevator is
seven and a half
craig climbs out onto the floor
craig hunched over makes his way down the hallway looking for lestercorp
he passes a hunched over man walking in the other direction
they nod to each other
craig finds a door marked lestercorp meeting americas filing needs since
all furniture is scaled down to fit into this low ceilinged space
a few other short men sit reading tiny magazines
craig approaches floris the receptionist
welcome to lestercorp
may we meet your filing needs
no uh my name is craig schwartz
i have an interview with mr
please have a seat mr
im sorry im afraid i have no idea what youre saying right now

craig takes a seat next to the other applicants
calling across the room fork ah did
the intercom buzzes
floris picks it up
to craig mr
i said yes

i have no time for piddling suggestions from mumbling job applicants my good man
lester will see you now
i think thats what he said
craig stands opens lesters door and enters
lester a giant of an old man sits hunched behind his tiny desk

extending his hand actually my name is craig schwartz dr
lester flips an intercom switch

lester watches eyes wide

i dont know how she puts up with this damn speech impediment of mine
you dont have a speech impediment dr
flattery will get you everywhere my boy
but im afraid i have to trust floris on this one
you see she has her doctorate in speech impedimentology from case western
perhaps youve read her memoirs i cant understand a word any of you are saying
pity it tells it like it is
thats why the eastern read jewish publishing establishment wont touch it
thats a quote from the book jacket
george will i think
beat i apologize if you cant understan a word im saying dr
i understand perfectly
choking up thank you for being kind enough to lie
you see ive been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech
why is this floor so short
low overhead mboy
we pass the savings on to you
laughs heartily but seriously thats all covered in orientation
its a small screening room with red velvet seats
there are a few people scattered about the squat theater
craig is among them
he looks around the room and his eyes rest momentarily on maxine
she is in her late s with close cropped black hair
her eyes are opaque her face expressionless her countenance trance like
she glances over at craig then turns back to the screen
the lights dim
a projector whirs and the screen is illuminated
we tilt up the building
music perky industrial film music
title the floor welcome to the floor of the mertin flemmer building
as you will now be spending your work day here it is important that you learn a bit about the history of this famous floor
don and wendy two office workers crouch in the hall and chat
both hold cups of coffee
don i was wondering do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings
its an interesting story wendy
many years ago in the late s james mertin an irish ship captain looking to invest in the future of our great country came to this town and decided to
erect an office building
he would call this building the mertin flemmer building after himself and someone else who local legend has it was named flemmer
an actor playing mertin sits at a desk and writes with aquill
he appears very stern and has mutton chop sideburns
captain mertin received an unexpected visitor
there is a knock at the door
enter ye if ye dare enter
a tiny woman enters
what want ye girl child
i am not a child captain mertin but rather an adult lady of miniature proportions
taken aback i see
well it is not my fault that thou art tiny
so if it is charity yer after then be gone with ye ye foul demon
i am not asking for alms but rather the ear of a kind man with a noble heart
speak then if ye must
captain mertin surely i am a god fearing christian woman like yourself but alas i am afraid that the world was not built with me in mind
door knobs are too high chairs are unwieldy high ceilinged rooms mock my stature
nor am i a marrie lady captain
after all who would marry a person of my diminutiveness
so i am forced to work for my few pennies a week as an optometrist
why cannot there be a place for me to work safe and comfortable
mertin wipes a tear from his eye
woman your story moves me like n other
me own sister was tiny and then died
therefore i shall make ye me wife
and i shall build a floor in my building between the th and th which will be scaled down so from now on there shall be at least one place
on gods green earth that you and your accursed kind can live in peace
don and wendy crouch and talk
so thats the story of
since the rents are considerably lower this floor has been adopted by businesses which for one reason or another are forced to cut corners after all
the overhead is low
ha ha ha
ha ha ha
title the end the screen goes dark
the lights go up
craig looks over at maxine
she stands and walks past him
unfortunately its bullshit
the real story of is so evil that it could never be revealed to americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors
is that true
well truth is for suckers isnt it
im craig schwartz just starting out at lestercorp
how dreary to be somebody how public like a frog to tell ones name the livelong june to an admiring bog
proudly emily dickinson
i wouldnt know
maxine walks away
lotte chops onions
a parrot sits on her head
craig stirs a pot on the stove
a monkey leaps from the top of the cabinet to the top of the refrigerator to the kitchen table
a dog watches the monkey and barks at it
to craig sorry honey
the dog continues to bark
an offscreen neighbor pounds the wall
lotte grabs the parrot off her head and leaves the room
shes locking me in a cage
isnt that cute
i just taught her that
what time are they supposed to be here
seven ish we have to make it an early night
besides ive got a morning appointment tomorrow with elijahs shrink
were getting to the bottom of this acid stomach
not paying attention hmmm
some sort of childhood trauma she thinks
possible feelings of inadequacy as a chimp
the doorbell rings
the dog barks
the parrot screams
the neighbor pounds on the wall
the dining room table is set up
craig and lotte and their friends peter and gloria are seated and eating dinner
there is an obvious lull in the conversation
good food lotte
craig helped too by the way
all the time
there is another lull
no kidding about that floor
no kidding peter
it almost sounds like make believe
beat like a storybook
beat like a fairy tale
beat its really great
beat so lotte when you say all vegetable do you mean all vegetable entire y
gloria and peter drive in silence
lotte told me that eskimos have a lot of words for snow
ten i think
i wonder why so many
because they have a lot of snow
isnt that interesting
craig washes the dishes
lotte dries them
they dont look at each other
craig in a cream colored suit pours over the file cabinets
floris watches from the doorway
over enunciating thank you floris
floris shrugs shakes her head
youre not like the other boys weve had here
granted i cant understand what youre saying either but your soft palette resonates tremendously well and you never ever constrict your epiglottis
i am a trained performer
swooning music to my ears
whatever you said
speak speak speak my magnificent friend speak
craig pours himself a cup of coffee
maxine approaches with an empty cup
craig fills her cup
you know ive been thinking about what you said yesterday about the orientation film being a cover up
i think youre on to something
and fifty other lines to get into a girls pants
you know if you ever got me you wouldnt have a clue what to do with me
thats the thing romeo
maxine walks away
craig is at his workbench painting the finishing touches on a new puppet
it is beautiful
it is maxine
lotte watches quietly from the door
a lotte puppet hangs from a hook tangled and dusty
craig is surprised caught
yeah just an idea i had
shes very beautiful
shrugging just an idea i had
craig hangs the puppet stands and switches off the light
cmon lets go to bed
the room is dark
lotte snores lightly
craig lies there with his eyes open
quietly he gets up and leaves the bedroom
lotte watches him go
craig stands above the puppet stage
he is working both the craig puppet and the maxine puppet at the same time
the two perform a beautiful and graceful pas de deux
they finish in a passionate embrace
quietly i would too know what to do with you
floris watches him from the doorway
lester watches floris from behind a cabinet
oh what magic those fingers could work on the right cabinet
strokes craigs neck alphabetize me baby
and dont forget i comes before u
floris laughs long and hard
too long and too hard
floris youre very nice but im afraid im in love with somebody else
upset im afraid i
have no idea what you are saying
floris runs from the room
lester pokes his head out from behind the cabinet
dont toy with floris schwartz
why if i were eighty years younger id box your ears
i wasnt toying with her sir
i was just
how old are you
one hundred and five
beat lots of it
i swear its almost not worth it
i piss orange
oh and i have to piss sitting down
like a godamn girly
every fifteen minutes
but nobody wants to die schwartz
ill keep that in mind sir
no sir e bob i dont die
but what i do is get older wrinkled like a former plum thats become the wrinkled prune you see before you
oh to be a young man again maybe then floris would care for me
the elderly have so much to offer sir
they are our link with history
i dont want to be your godamn link damn you
i want to feel floris naked thighs against my own
i want to know passion
i want my body to inspire lust in that beautiful complex woman
i want her to shiver in a spasm of ecstasy when i penetrate her
oh god the agony of the flesh schwartz
lester while i am flattered that you share your feelings with me i believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion
meet me at the juicy juice juice bar after work today and ill spill my goddamn guts for you
craig squats next to a payphone
into phone i wont be late
i just have to listen to lesters sexual fantasies and drink carrot juice for a little while
its a job thing
maxine walks by
craig grabs her arm signals for her to wait a minute
into phone i gotta go back to work
craig hangs up
i just wanted to say hi
did you know i still dont know your name or where you work
how about this if i can guess your first name within three tries you have to come out for a drink with me tonight
watches her face as he guesses buuuhhppaahhhhnnn

a beautiful crazy song maxine
i am dubious but i dont welsh

youre late i walk
so help me if i find out you cheated
in heaven maxine
craig walks down the hall
a tiny smile flits across maxines face
lester and craig sit at a table
there are several emptied glasses of carrot juice in front of lester
craig nurses one glass and keeps checking his watch
imagine a room full of women
nubile blonde wet with desire schwartz
a harem if you will
me in leather
a harness if you like
i am the object of this desire and all eyes are on me as i speak
ladies i begin

lester its been really fascinating but im afraid i have to get home to my wife now

afterthought you can come too if you like schwartz
checking watch thats sounds fine sir
craig hurries to the door
lester downs craigs juice signals the waiter for more
maxine sits at the bar watching her watch
craig rushes into the room frantic out of breath
he spots maxine and plops himself next to her
maxine maxine maxine

but enough about me
the bartender approaches
whatll you have
to bartender the usual barry

the bartender walks away

no no its your energy or your attitude or the way you carry yourself or
christ youre not a fag are you
because i dont want to be wasting my time
the drinks arrive
maxines is in an enormous fishbowl of a glass
its bright blue with fruit and marshmallows swimming in it
paper umbrellas stick out of it an plastic monkeys hang from the rim
thats the usual
dont let the girly shit fool you
itd blow your shorts off
maxine downs it like a shot of whiskey
she pushes the empty glass to the bartender
set me up again barry
the bartender walks away with the empty glass
im not a homosexual
i just like women for more than their bodies
i guess you could say im the new american male
youre a fag or a liar
backpedaling i mean i am really attracted to you
mocking i mean i am really attracted to you

maxine gets up

ill be in in a little while
i need to unwind a little
beat ill be in soon
a little while
craig works the craig and maxine puppets
the puppets sit on the edge of the small stage and chat
craig does a pretty fair impersonation of maxines voice
as maxine fascinated tell me craig why do you love puppeteering
as craig well maxine im not sure exactly
perhaps its the idea of becoming someone else for a little while
being inside another skin
moving differently thinking differently feeling differently
as maxine interesting
would you like to be inside my skin craig
think what i think
feel what i feel
as craig more than anything
as maxine its good in here craig
better than your wildest dreams
the puppets kiss
craig waits at the coffee machine
checks his watch
finally maxine approaches
youre not someone i could get interested in
you play with dolls
its the idea of being inside someone else feeling what they feel seeing what they see
please let me explain
craig grabs maxines hand and drags her into an empty office
craig pulls maxine in closes the door
its just and ive never done this before maxine but its just that i feel something for you
ive never felt this before for anyone not even my wife
my future is with you maxine
you might want to check those tarot cards one more time
maxine heads for the door
craig sits on a box
he puts his head in his hands and sighs
across the room he notices a very small door with a two by four nailed across it
another evil secret of the floor
craig pries the two by four off and opens the door
its a dark and wet membranous tunnel inside
maxine is gonna love this
craig lets go of the door and it slams shut
lester sits at his desk studying an instruction manual for a juicer
the spanking new juicer sits on his desk
there is an urgent knocking at the door
craig rushes in
just the fellow i wanted to see
proudly spreading his arms juicer
easy as pie
just keep your fingers clear of the blade and never never use it while bathing in a tub full of water
lester i have a question
i was in that vacant office down the hall and i stumbled upon a little door and
yes the little door
checks watch there is a short film on the little door in the orientation room in exactly two minutes
if you hurry youll just make it
thank you sir
lester waits a moment
then dials the phone
put up reel
craig sits in the otherwise empty screening room
the lights dim the film begins
wendy crouches in the vacant office and studies the closed little door
whatre you up to in this vacant office
well don i peeked in here even though i know its against floor policy
and i discovered that theres a little tiny door in here
isnt it cute
its almost like a little dollys door
i wonder what its for
laughing thats right wendy it is against floor policy but as long as youre here let me tell you what i know about our cute little door friend
many years ago this very office was occupied by a kindly old watchmaker named mr
an old man toils away in the dusty office
i must have a small store room to store my merchandise when i am through working on it
i know i will build a tiny store room
thats some story don
truth is stranger than fiction wendy
the lights go up
craig sits there for a moment
an usher pushes a broom down the aisle
the usher mumbles something into a walkie talkie
craig opens the little door and climbs into the membranous hallway
the door slams shut behind him
its dark and wet
the walls are soft and membranous
there is a dripping sound
craig crawls along
soon something starts to pull craig as if he is being sucked through a straw
there is a flash of light
the pov of someone reading a newspaper
the person lifts a cup of coffee to his mouth
there is a slurping sound
the person puts down the coffee cup and the newspaper and stands up
losing his balance whoa
what the hell
where am i
were still in pov
the person walks across the room picks up his wallet from a coffee table
looks in a mirror and checks his teeth for food
its john malkovich
its that actor guy
whats his name
that actor guy
am i inside him
am i in his brain
am i him
is he me
does he know im here
my brain is reeling
is his brain reeling
malkovich walks to the front door opens it exits his apartment
maxine sits at her desk eats a sandwich
looks at a fashion magazine and chats on the phone
the puppeteer told me he loves me today
laughs i know
i cant think of anything more pathetic
john malkovichs pov from the back seat of the cab
the cab pulls away from the curb
resonant throughout the broadhurst theater please
the cabbie studies malkovich in his rearview mirror as he drives
say arent you that actor guy
john fucking malkovich
i liked you in that one movie
the one where youre that jewel thief
i never played a jewel thief
who am i thinking of
i dont know
im pretty sure it was you
hey could i get your autograph now
oh what the hell its for me
im your biggest fan
the cabbie hands a pad back over the seat
malkovich reaches for it
there is a slurping sound
the image starts to fade then suddenly goes black
its on the side of jersey turnpike
there is a pop and craig falls from nowhere into the ditch
he is soaking wet and now dirty from the ditch
he stands looks confusedly around sees a n
after a moment he goes to the side of the road and sticks out his thumb
maxine sits behind her desk with her feet up and talks on the phone
im just about to close up here
craig walks in disheveled and exhausted
maxine sees him keeps talking
into phone meet you at the pig in twenty minutes
laughs lasciviously oh yeah maybe ill keep my legs closed till then
to craig im splitting for the day
lock up for me wont you darling
maxine stands puts some stuff in her purse
dont you want to know what happened to me
maxine heads for the door
craig grabs her arm
this is important
looking at his hand on her arm it better be
craig sits maxine down in a chair lets go of her arm
theres a tiny door in that empty office
its a portal maxine
it takes you inside john malkovich
you see the world through john malkovichs eyes then after about fifteen minutes youre spit out into a ditch on the side of the new jersey turnpike
who the fuck is john malkovich
hes an actor
one of the great american actors of the th century
whats he been in
lots of things
hes very well respected
that jewel thief movie for example
the point is that this is a very odd thing supernatural for lack of a better word
it raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self about the existence of the soul
am i me
is malkovich malkovich
was the buddha right is duality an illusion
do you see what a can of worms this portal is
i dont think i can go on living my life as i have lived it
theres only one thing to do
lets get married right away
is this malkovich fellow appealing
yes of course
hes a celebrity
well sell tickets
tickets to malkovich
two hundred dollars a pop
but theres something profound here maxine we cant exploit it
ill do it myself
i was going to offer a partnership to you but this way its more money for me
you wanted to be partners with me
itd be fun
then but maxine can of worms
end of the world
illusory nature of existence
ill protect you dollface
maxine reaches over and squeezes his lips affectionately between her thumb and forefinger
in love oh
craig and lotte are getting into evening clothes
dont be ridiculous
there is no such thing as a portal into someone elses brain
soul im telling you lotte
i was right inside him looking out

i want to try
i want to be john malkovich
plus id like to meet this partner of yours
nervously well you know were going to be very busy tomorrow
ill tell you what
lets do it tonight
well do it right now
on the way to lesters house
craig holds open the small door as lotte climbs in
ill meet you on the turnpike
the door slams shut
me too babe
craig hurries out the door
malkovich is in the shower
we watch from his pov as he soaps himself
he does this in a sensual manner
malkovich steps out of the shower slowly towels himself dry
lotte lands in the ditch
she is wet and ragged
traffic whizzes by
craig turns on the headlights in his parked car
they shine on lotte
craig steps out of the car
i have to go back
i have to go back now
well talk about it in the car
craig helps lotte up and toward the car
lotte looks distractedly out the window
i have to go back craig
being inside did something to me
all of a sudden everything made sense
i knew who i was
you werent you
you were john malkovich
tickled i was wasnt i
yelling out the window i was john fucking malkovich
laughs then intensely take me back craig
were late for lester
its a posh place with flocked wallpaper and candelabras
lester craig and lotte sit around an elegantly appointed table with all different sorts of juices in front of them
lotte is still wet
lester sits quite close to her
tell me lotte can you understand a word im saying
yes of course dr
oh be still my heart
lester would you point me toward the restroom
with immense pleasure my dear
down that hall ninth door on the left
watch the step down

lotte smiles and heads down the hall
more beet spinach juice my friend
no thank you sir

i just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to work at lestercorp but im afraid im going to have to tender my resignation effectively immediately

and what sort of business will this be
if you dont mind my asking
uh import export
right on actually
beat in the vacant office
so well still be seeing each other
the vacant office
be warned schwartz there are certain doors which should never be opened
lotte walks down the ritzy hallway
she is counting closed doors in search of the bathroom
she opens a door looks inside gasps then enters the room
lotte enters the room
it is dark
at the far end there is what amounts to a candle lit shrine to john malkovich
the centerpiece of the shrine is an enormous photograph of malkovich bordered by a garland of flowers
lotte stares at it for a moment then drops to her knees in front of it
lotte has just taken a shower
she towels herself dry in much the same way as malkovich
her eyes are closed
she opens them slowly and sees herself in the mirror
disappointedly she drops the towel and heads out of the bathroom
craig sits at his work table
he is pulling the heads off of the craig and the maxine puppets
he puts the maxine head on the craig puppet
my kingdom for your portal maxine
maxine sits at her desk composing an ad
craig stands behind her ostensibly looking over her shoulder but actually studying the back of her head
here it is
reading ever want to be someone else

he sits on the couch
drinks coffee and reads a copy of awake and sing
bach plays on the stereo in the background
reading aloud so you believe in god
you got something for it
you worked for all the capitalists
you harvested the fruit from your labor
you got god

but the past comforts you
the present smiles on you yes
the phone rings
malkovich puts down the script and picks up the phone
into phone yeah
telephone voice mr

howd you get this number
its just that i fantasize about you and well speaking to you now has gotten me sort of excited and

giggling ooh such authority
ny nipples are at attention general malkovich sir

malkovich hangs up the phone
attempting thought control meet her there

malkovich picks up a pen and writes bernardos
lotte pops into the ditch
shes wet and slimy
how was it
i have to go back tonight
at eight exactly
dont crowd me craig
its a busy italian restaurant
malkovich looks around checks his watch
a guy walks up to him
excuse me are you john malkovich
you were really great in that movie where you played that retard
thank you very much
i just wanted to tell you that
and say thank you
i have a cousin thats a retard so as you can imagine it means a lot to me to see retards portrayed on the silver screen so compassionately
the guy walks away
malkovich scans the room
maxine enters the restaurant
we see her but malkovich doesnt single her out of the crowd
she looks around
maxine spots malkovich
and heads over
he focuses on her
im so glad you decided to come
maxine holds out her hand
she is charming
malkovich takes her hand
i didnt think i was going to come but i felt oddly compelled
i have to admit i was a bit intrigued by your voice
god shes beautiful
the way shes looking at me
and the funny thing is
malkovich my voice is probably the least intriguing thing about me
ive never been looked at like this by a woman
can i get you a drink
whatever youre having
lotte is soaking wet
she stares out the window
so how was it
what was he doing
oh you know not a lot
just hanging around his apartment
i think he must be a lonely man
you see men can feel unfulfilled too
im glad youre realizing that
you shouldnt be so quick to assume that switching bodies would be the answer to all your problems
you know i was thinking that we should have maxine over for dinner
since you two are partners and all
it might be a nice gesture
i dont know
theres some tension between us
id hate to expose you to that
itll be okay
ill fix my lasagna
well smoke a joint
dreamily tensions will melt away
craig lotte and maxine are seated at the table and eating lasagna
lotte eyes maxine
craig eyes maxine
there is an awkward silence
to maxine did you know that eskimos have not one but fifty words for snow
its because they have so much of it
after dinner ill show you my puppets
after that ill introduce you to my favorite monkey elijah
hes got an ulcer due to a suppressed childhood trauma
but were getting to the bottom of it
there is another silence
to no one in particular the way i see it the world is divide into those go after what they want and those who dont
the passionate ones the ones who go after what they want may not get what they want but they remain vital in touch with themselves and when they lie on
their deathbeds they have few regrets
the ones who dont go after what they want
well who gives a shit about them anyway
there is another silence
suddenly at the same moment both craig and lotte lunge for maxine and start kissing her passionately about the face and neck
they stop just as suddenly and look at each other
lotte looks away
craig i just dont find you attractive
and lotte im smitten with you but only when youre in malkovich
when i looked into his eyes last night i could feel you peering out
behind the stubble and the too prominent brow and the male pattern baldness i sensed your feminine longing peering out and it just slew me
disgusted my god
lotte strokes maxines face
craig clears dishes from the table
to lotte removing her hand only to john sweetie
gets up thanks for a wonderful dinner
walks past kitchen
to craig no hard feelings partner
craig and lotte look at each other
i want a divorce
it is deadly silent
craig and maxine sit at their desks
the wall clock ticks
craig whistles tunelessly every once in a while looking up and discreetly checking out maxine
eventually there is a knock at the door
a little too urgently come in
erroll a sad fat young man enters meekly
hello im here about the ad
please have a seat
erroll sits in a chair in front of craigs desk
he glances nervously over at maxine
when you say i can be somebody else what do you mean exactly
we can put you inside someone elses body for fifteen minutes
oh this is just the medical breakthrough ive been waiting for
are their any side effects
please say no
please say no
long term psychic or physiological repercussions
dont be an ass
can i be anyone i want
you can be john malkovich
well thats perfect
my second choice
ah this is wonderful
too good to be true
you see im a sad man
sad and fat and alone
oh ive tried all the diets my friends
lived for a year on nothing but imitation mayonnaise
did it work
you be the judge
king of new york
man about town
most eligible bachelor
the schopenhauer of the th century
thin man extraordinaire
two hundred dollars please
a thousand times yes
erroll takes out his wallet
craig waits by his car checks his watch
erroll plops into the ditch wet and unkempt
he looks around sees craig charges him with a yell and gives him an enormous bear hug
oh thank you
thousand times thank you
gasping for air tell your friends
oh i will and i have many many friends and associates my friend
all by the way in overeaters anonymous
all of them fat and alone like me all of them dream of being someone else all of them with john malkovich as their second choice
the hall outside craig and maxines office sports a long line of crouching fat people all clutching cash in their hands
craig kneels at the door and peeks out through the mail slot
maxine sits at her desk and files her toenails
this is amazing
were gonna be rich
so unbolt the fucking door einstein
craig unlocks the door
lester steps in closes the door behind him locks it
youre making a big mistake schwartz
nods to maxine maam dr
lester i dont know what youre talking about
there are rules boy procedures etiquette
this is not a toy
ive been waiting seventy years to utilize this room grooming myself quietly setting the stage performing ablutions paying tribute seeing all his motion pictures again and again
worshipping schwartz worshipping properly
i am not alone
there are others
we are legion
you will pay for this blasphemy
you will pay dearly
craig looks at maxine
there is a moment of tension
craig opens the door
the first few fat people move noisily into the room
many cloaked people in the room kneeling with candles in hand before the lit photo of malkovich
lotte kneels in the back row
they chant how much do we love you
we loved you in making mr
that is how much we love you
we even own the directors cut on laser disc
please accept us into your head as we have accepted you into our hearts
please let us be you
the worshippers mill about chatting drinking coffee nibbling on cookies
may i have your attention please
we have a new disciple among us tonight
she is the wife of schwartz
a stunned hush falls over the group
apologetically im getting divorced
no you mustnt my child
but why son of malkovich
we need you on the inside my child
to report on his comings and goings and if need be to
hands lotte a gun for lack of a better word
craig is putting stuff in boxes
lotte enters in her cloak
what are you doing
whats with the hooded cloak
dont go craig
ive been thinking
lets try to work this out
weve got so much history
still packing you should feed your animals
theyre looking peaked
im getting rid of the fucking animals
im getting rid of the animals
ive lost interest
besides theyre standing between you and me
no theyre not
youve always hated the animals
youve always loved the animals
im giving them up
ive found a new focus
beat us of course
craig looks up from his packing
he and lotte stare at each other for a long while
tenderly oh lot
what about maxine
they look at each other and laugh them fall back into the embrace
they both get faraway looks in their eyes
the clock reads am
craig in his pajamas is working the craig and maxine puppets
they make love on the bare puppet stage
craig seems possessed
the phone rings
maxine sleepily picks it up
i have to see you
can you call him and invite us over
give me one hour to get inside him exactly
maxine checks her alarm clock
the time is am
the doorbell rings
maxine in a sheer black nightgown answers it
john malkovich stands there
thanks so much for coming over
oh im really glad you called
maxine gestures for him to enter
as malkovich passes by her she checks the wall clock
the time is
lotte sits on the floor in the dark
she leans out of breath against the wall next to the portal and checks her watch
the time is
she pulls open the door
maxine and malkovich sit a bit awkwardly next to each other on the couch
so do you enjoy being an actor
its very rewarding
the digital clock on the vcr clicks over to am
maxines look softens and she kisses malkovich hard on the lips
he seems surprised but quickly warms to it
we shift top malkovichs pov as maxine begins to unbutton malkovichs shirt
oh my darling
oh my sweetheart
i love you lotte
stopping im sorry did you just call me lotte
do you mind
thinking no i guess not
im an actor
they get back to it
oh my sweet beautiful lotte
thinks hes playing along yes maxine yes
this is too good to be true
a sweaty and spent craig sneaks back into the bedroom
he sees that the bed is empty
with a gasp and a wail of release lotte pops into the ditch
she is soaking wet and breathes heavily
she just lies there
craig is hunched over a cup of coffee
the front door can be heard to open
after a moment lotte appears in the kitchen doorway
she is caked with dirt
craig looks up at her
you were him last night werent you
and he was with her
we love her craig
me and john
dont forget me
well you have the maxine action figure to play with
craig looks down at his coffee
that was nasty
life is confusing isnt it
sometimes were forced to make hard decisions
beat id like for us to stay together craig
you know platonically if thats possible
i truly value our friendship
i feel that somehow my parents never prepared me to make this particular decision
not that i blame them
how could they know
todays world is so complicated
i have to go away now
im sorry lotte
im so sorry
craig enters with red rimmed eyes
maxine sits at her desk actually looking kind of radiant
are you torturing me on purpose
matter of fact ive fallen in love
i dont think so
ive fallen in love
this is what people whove fallen in love look like
you picked the unrequited variety
very bad for the skin
youre evil maxine
do you have any idea what its like to have two people look at you with total lust and devotion through the same pair of eyes
no i dont suppose you would
its quite a thrill craig
craig turns and walks out the door
craig hurries past a long line of fat people all looking eager all clutching cash
lester sits at his desk
the intercom buzzes
depressing switch yes my dear
intercom voice someone names a lot of warts on line two
thank you floris
intercom voice think jew florist
pressing line good morning lotte
lester everythings falling apart
craig is at the counter buying a pistol
lester and lotte sit at a table
they both have really large glasses of carrot juice in front of them
i blew it dr
you followed your heart my child and that is not necessarily a bad thing
but now weve lost access to craig
laughs my child i dont think its a great mystery what craigs up to
craig stands still and tense with gun in hand
we hear the front door unlock
she does not see craig
he grabs her from behind as she passes
craig holds the gun to her head
im your goddamn wife
once you vowed to cherish me forever
now you hold a gun to my head
yeah well welcome to the nineties
suck my dick
slapping her shut up
lotte is stunned
she feels the muzzle against her forehead
she shuts up
keeping the gun trained on lotte craig dials the phone
he hands the receiver to her
he holds his ear to the receiver also
tell her you need to see her
to craig you bastard
craig cocks the pistol
be all that someone else can be
looking at craig i have to see you
oh but we cant
its business hours
i need to keep the membranous tunnel open for paying customers
sotto tell her what the hell close early today live dangerously
what the hell darling
close early today live dangerously
i love this new devil may care side of you
alrighty ill track down lover boy and ill see both of you in one hour
maxine hangs up
lotte hands the phone to craig who hangs it up
craig opens up the big cage where elijah is housed and motions with the gun for lotte to enter
hes locking me in a cage
craig slaps lotte hard
she looks at him almost sadly
lesson number one be careful what you teach your parrot
craig tapes lottes mouth ties her hands and feet
elijah watches him tie her
he becomes somewhat agitated and holds his stomach
malkovich is rehearsing some business on stage
maxine watches from the house
she anxiously checks her watch then points to it so malkovich can see
tommy can i take fifteen
malkovich and maxine are having sex on the make up table against the mirror
we now watch the scene from malkovichs pov
i cant believe it
this is too good to be true
craig is toweling himself off hurriedly combing his hair
youre glowing again
a girl has a right to glow if she wants
its in the fucking constitution
craig smiles to himself
craig is feeding the various caged animals
he puts two plates of food in elijahs cage
lotte is ungagged and unbound now
she eats as craig slumps down next to the cage gun in hand
it was lovely being you being malkovich my dear
id never seen the passionate side of sweet maxine before or her actual tits for that matter
if only ive been thinking to myself if only i could actually feel what malkovich feels rather than just see what he sees
and then dare i say it if only i could control his arms his legs his pelvis and make them do my bidding
itll never happen fuckface
ah but youre forgetting one thing lambchop
im a puppeteer
craig picks up the phone and dials
he smiles as he holds the receiver up to lottes face
malkovich and maxine are having sex on maxines couch
lotte this is so good
tense commanding move right hand across her left breast now
move right hand across her left breast now
move right hand across her left breast now
malkovich clumsily awkwardly moves his hand across maxines breast
holy shit yes
holy shit yes
he said what i said
he said what i said
is that you
yes yes sweetheart yes
yes yes sweetheart yes
scared what the fuck is going on
im not talking
this is not me
maxine kisses malkovich hard on the lips
there is a sucking sound
there is a pop and craig lands in the ditch
a panicked malkovich is pulling on his clothes
something was making me talk
some goddamn thing was making me move
i gotta get out of here
oh dollface it was just your passion for me taking hold
no dollface i know what my passion taking hold feels like
i gotta go
maxine falls back on the couch and sighs contentedly
a wet mess craig sits next to lottes cage
lotte is bound and gagged
i did it sweetie
i moved his arm across your girlfriends glorious tit
i made him talk
and oh there was the beginning of sensation in the fingertips
its just a matter of practice before malkovich becomes nothing more than another puppet hanging next to my worktable
malkovich paces nervously a glass of whisky in his hand
kevin bacon sits on the couch and fiddles with a rubics cube
its like nothing ive ever felt before
i think im going crazy
im sure youre not going crazy
kevin im telling you
it was like nothing ive
yeah yeah yeah
yadda yadda yadda
were you stoned
yes but you see someone else was talking through my mouth
you were stoned
end of story
how hot is this babe
i think it mightve been this lotte woman talking through me
maxine likes to call me lotte
now thats hot
shes using you to channel some dead lesbian lover
let me know when youre done with her
this is my type of chick
im done with her now
tonight really creeped me out
youre crazy to let go of a chick who calls you lotte
i tell you that as a friend
i dont know anything about her
what if shes some sort of witch or something
all the better
hey hot lesbian witches next geraldo buddy boy
ha ha ha
i gotta know the truth kevin
the truth is for suckers johnny boy
malkovich in a baseball cap and sunglasses leans against the wall
after a moment maxine emerges from the building and walks down the block
malkovich follows at a safe distance
the elevator doors are pried open
maxine and a few other people climb out
the last to emerge is malkovich
he is astounded by the dimensions of the floor
he turns the corner and sees the long line of crouching fat people
maxine goes into the office and closes the door
maxine sees j
stenciled on the office door
he turns to the first fat man and line
excuse me what type of service does this company provide
you get to be john malkovich for fifteen minutes
two hundred clams
quietly flipped i see
no cutting by the way
malkovich pounds on the door
several fat people jump on malkovich and start beating him
craig steps out of the office
break it up
break it up
everybody gets a chance to be
the fat people climb off malkovich
his glasses and cap have been knocked off and everyone recognizes him
oh were so sorry mr
i hope me and my associates from overeaters anonymous didnt hurt you too terribly
to craig inside
craig and malkovich enter
maxine looks up startled but controlling it
what the fuck is going on
malkovich my name is craig schwartz
i can explain
we operate a little business her that
simulates for our clientele the experience of
being you actually
sure after a fashion
let me try
why im sure it would pale in comparison to the actual experience
let me try
let him try
of course right this way mr
compliments of the house
craig ushers malkovich to the portal door opens it
repulsed by the slime jesus
malkovich climbs in
the door closes
what happens when a man climbs through his own portal
shrugs how the hell would i know
i wasnt a philosophy major
malkovich crawls through
suddenly there is a slurping sound
we see malkovich hurtling through different environments
its scary giant toads swirling eddies of garish colored lights naked old people pointing and laughing black velvet clown paintings
malkovich pops into a chair in a swakn night club
hes wearing a tuxedo
the woman across the table from him is also malkovich but in a gown
he looks around the restaurant
everyone is malkovich in different clothes
malkovich is panicked
the girl malkovich across the table looks at him seductively winks and talks
malkovich malkovich malkovich malkovich
malkovich looks confused
the malkovich waiter approaches pen and pad in hand ready to take their orders
malkovich malkovich malkovich
malkovich malkovich malkovich malkovich
turning to malkovich malkovich
malkovich looks down at the menu
every item is malkovich
he screams malkovich
the waiter jots it down on his pad
malkovich pushes himself away from the table and runs for the exit
he passes the stage where a girl singer malkovich is singin sensuously into the microphone
she is backed by a s style big band of malkoviches
malkovich malkovich malkovich malkovich
malkovich flies through the back door
malkovich lands with a thud in the ditch
craig is waiting there with his van
on its side is painted see the world in malk o vision followed by a phone number
malkovich is huddled and shivering and soaking wet
so how was it
i have been to the dark side
i have seen a world that no man should ever see
for most people its a rather pleasant experience
what exactly did you
this portal is mine and must be sealed up forever
for the love of god
with all respect sir i discovered that portal
its my livelihood
its my head schwartz and ill see you in court
malkovich trudges off along the shoulder of the turnpike
calling after him and whos to say i wont be seeing what youre seeing
cars whiz by malkovich
someone yells from a passing car
malkovich looks up
a beer can comes flying out of the car and hits him on the head
craig is feeding the animals
his gun is stuck in his pants
he gets to lottes cage
she is bound but ungagged
she looks haggard
once this was a relationship based on love
now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head
anyway you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in maxine
you fell in love with her first
yeah but i didnt do anything about it
out of respect for our marriage
you didnt do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldnt let you near her with a ten foot pole which is by the way about
nine feet nine inches off the mark anyway
beat thats true
oh god lotte what have i become
my wife in a cage with a monkey
a gun in my hand
betrayal in my heart
maybe this is what youve always been craig you just never faced it before
perhaps youre right
i cant let you go though
too much has happened
youre my ace in the hole
i need a shower
oh god im sorry
im some kind of monster
im the guy you read about in the paper and go hes some kind of monster
youre not a monster craig
just a confused man
i love you so much
she dials her phone opens her cage puts phone to her ear
but i gotta go now
ive got to go be johnny
be all that someone
we have to meet
craig hangs up tapes lottes mouth
ill tell you all about it when i get home
lotte fiddles with the ropes on her hands elijah slumped in the corner of the cage blankly watches her moving hands
suddenly his eyes narrow
something is going on in his brain
we move slowly into his eyes
it is a memory blurry and overexposed the color washed out
we see a weathered wooden sign which reads africa
the sound of running feet huffing frantic breathing
we watch from up in a tree elijahs pov as two men in safari suits chase a couple of chimps across the jungle floor
the chimps are screaming as the safari men tackle them and tie them up
the safari men laugh
well there monkeys aint going nowhere
lets get us a couple a brews fore the boss comes back
the safari men leave the chimps on the ground
we descend from the trees to the ground next to the bound chimps
one of the chimps looks at the camera
he grunts and squeals
son untie your mother and me
before the great bald chimp men return
a small pair of chimp hands enter into the frame and struggle to untie the ropes but to no avail
chimp two speaks
why you little bastard
elijah is wrestled to the ground amidst much screaming
elijah shakes off the memory and looks determinedly at the ropes on lottes hands
he attempts to untie the knot
he works furiously and succeeds
lotte pulls the tape from her mouth
oh elijah you are magnificent
elijah beams and screams for ecstatic joy
lotte unlocks the cage and dials the phone
listen it hasnt been me in john the last three times
craigs had me locked up in the apartment
he made me call you at gunpoint
its been him
oh god its been him
beat calmly really
well you know hes quite good
anyway i have a session with malkovich i have to attend
ill speak with you soon
but maxine i thought it was me you loved
i thought so too doll
i guess we were mistaken
maxine hangs up
lotte visibly shaken dials the phone
the doorbell rings
malkovich answers it
maxine stands there dressed in an evening gown
come on in
i can explain about the portal darling
dont con me maxine
i just let you up here to tell you that and to tell you that im taking you and schwartz to court
oh shut up
beat craig darling are you in there
malkovich tenses up then shakes his head in an awkward puppet like manner
when malkovich speaks it seems to be against him will
how did you know it was me
lotte called me
oh so the bitch escaped
apparently you can control this malkovich fellow now
im getting better all the time
ill say you are
lets do it on his kitchen table then make him eat an omelette off of it
as malkovich no
as craig oh shut up you overrated sack of shit
malkovich begins undressing and does a lewd bump and grind while looking mortified
malkovich craig laughs wildly
lesters hand is in a bloody bandage
the juicer sits on hi desk
lotte sits across from him looking nervous and hollow eyed
you know i think it pays to leave juice making to the trained professionals
you look terrible my dear
craig stole maxine from me dr
hmmm a lesbian are you
i must inform you that i find that highly arousing
no you dont understand
ive been inside malkovich when im with maxine
slaps lotte furiously what
that is not allowed
my god you are supposed to be one of us
you know you must never partake of malkovich by yourself
no i didnt know that
oh didnt anyone show you the indoctrination video
right this way
lotte site next to lester in the darkened auditorium
the projector whirs
the screen lights up
a much younger lester addresses the camera in this black and white film which seems to have been made in the s
welcome my fellow malkovichians
as you may already know today a baby was born into this sad world
we see a shot of a newborn
his name is john horatio hannibal malkovich
and we are the keepers of the door to his soul
one day when his brain is big enough we will all journey into his head and live there for all eternity
following the teachings of our leader karl marx we will build the ultimate communist community one body and hundreds maybe thousands of brains inside working together to form a super
human intellect capable of curing disease stopping all war and ruling the world with a benevolent fist
we will take a wife a woman of uncommon beauty and intellect who is as yet still an infant herself
we see a photo of another infant this one with a ribbon in her hair
her name is floris horatia hannibella dement
does floris know that shes the chosen
well i tried to explain it to her but
lester points to his ear and shrugs
malkovich and maxine lie naked on the bed looking quite relaxed
you still there sweets
ive figured out how to hold on as long as i want
oddly enough its all in the wrists
little girl pout do a puppet show for me craig honey
you mean with malkovich
id love to see your work
malkovich leans over and kisses her then gets up
ill do something i call craigs dance of despair and disillusionment
malkovich performs the same dance that the craig pupper did at the beginning of the film
it is exactly the same complete with impossible somersaults and perspiring brow
he finishes by falling to his knees and weeping
moved that was incredible
you see maxine it isnt just playing with dolls
youre right my darling its so much more
its playing with people
malkovich kisses maxine
she snuggles close to him
stay in him forever
as malkovich screaming no
as craig calmly but how will we make a living my love if our clientele doesnt have access to our product
well well have all the money in malkovichs bank account plus he still gets acting work occasionally
as malkovich breaking through no
as craig to malkovich shut up will you
were trying to think here
to maxine it is sort of like being a puppeteer
i like that about it
no one would ever have to know its not him
an idea wait a minute
what if everybody knew
what if we presented malkovich as the worlds most complicated puppet and me as the only puppeteer sophisticated enough to work him
wed wipe the floor with the great mantini
oh craiggy thats brilliant
the worshippers are assembled
lotte stands before them
i have sinned unwittingly against the community
and for this i am truly sorry
w w whats it like on the inside
oh its glorious
oooh i wanna go
i wanna go
i say its time
perhaps youre right terry
were all prepared and perhaps this schwartz fellow is forcing our hand a bit
we will enter the portal tonight
maxine and malkovich are furiously filling the portal with cement
suddenly malkovich stops and runs to the office door screaming a bloodcurdling scream
he stops just as suddenly begins to strangle himself
craig to malkovich shut up
to maxine sorry dear i lost control for a minute
kissing him its okay my sweet
they go back to filling the portal
there is the sound of many shuffling feet in the hallway
the door flies open and the malkovichians led by lester and lotte burst in
malkovich and maxine turn with a start
aaaahhhh the portal
to malkovich you bastard
lotte lunges for malkovich
lester grabs her arm holds her back
dont harm the vessel
its craig in there i can tell
i understand but we must protect the vessel at all costs
to malkovich please craig please step aside and allow us to have what is rightfully ours
squatters rights lester
craig laughs somewhat maniacally
maxine slips her arm through craigs joins him in his laughter and glances triumphantly over at lotte
now excuse us we have an entertainment legend to create
to the cult members clear the way for them my friends
they will be dealt with in due time
the malkovichians grumble and let malkovich and maxine exit
now lets see what we can do to salvage this portal
for the sake of all that is good
the malkovichians converge on the sealed portal and begin clawing desperately at the quick drying cement
fingers are scraped raw and we see smears of blood and skin on the rough gray surface
a slick looking agent answers a buzzing phone
of course send him right in
dont ever keep him waiting again
do you understand
malkovich and maxine enter
the agent stands holds out his hand
great to see you
sorry about the cunt at reception
this is my fiancee maxine
the agent shakes maxines hand
great to see you maxine
sorry about the cunt at reception
please have a seat
malkovich and maxine sit
can i get you anything
into phone teresa get me a chicken soup
to malkovich and maxine chicken soup
maxine and malkovich shake their heads no
ill get right to the point larry
im a puppet now
im being controlled by the worlds greatest puppeteer craig schwartz
no clue oh yeah hes good
and i want to show off his skills by performing a one puppet extravaganza in reno
can you arrange that
just let me make a couple of calls
the cult members are still there now with picks shovels
they are worn out and sweaty
the portal is excavated but it seems ragged and destroyed
man emerges from the hole a rope tied around his waist
thats the last of it boss
lester peers through the door
well lets see what weve got here
lester crawls into the tunnel the door slams behind him
lester crawls through
there is a slurping sound and a flash of light
the scene is in black and white
bombs are dropping
there is a blonde in forties clothes there
lester views the scene through somebodys pov
my god where am i
this seems so familiar
the person walks past a mirror
my god im hitler in the bunker
we look over to see a director and camera crew
oh im just the actor in that twilight zone episode
there is a popping sound
lester pops into the ditch
one of his cult members is waiting with a car and looking hopeful
lester sadly shakes his head no
the cult members mill about drinking coffee chatting
lester enters with the cult member who picked him up at the ditch
all quiet down and look over at him
thank you all for your efforts but im afraid we can no longer get into malkovich through the portal
panicky why not
i need to get in there
im not certain my dear but i believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route
ill gladly dispose of him in the name of the order son of malkovich
im afraid that no physical harm must come to him as long as he inhabits the vessel
raises hand oooh i got an idea
what if we build another portal to malkovich like around back and sneak in that way
only captain mertin knew how to build a portal dummy and hes dead
actually my friends i suppose its time i told you im captain james mertin
the members fall into a stunned silence
lester takes some refrigerator magnets and spells out l e s t e r on a board
he then rearranges them for a while
you see lester is an anagram for mertin
lester continues to rearrange the letters getting a little tense now
it used to work im sure of it
several members check their watches
oh damn it to hell
anyway i am
l e s t e r has been left as e l r e s t as lester turns from the board to face the congregation
how can this be
i thought you were only one hundred and five years old
mertin would have to be
chuckles amiably im two hundred and five truth be told
flirtatiously you dont look a day over one hundred and five captain
whats your secret
lots of carrot juice little lady
that and a deal with the devil
there is a lot of murmuring in the room now
so what exactly are you saying
are we in cahoots with the dark master here
the cultists get tense start to leave en masse
its not that bad
when we get into malkovich we still get to rule the world just like i told you
the only difference is that we rule in the name of evil instead of good
people stop in their tracks
thats the only difference
the cultists think about is then shrug and stay put
well i for one am resigning
i will not serve evil
i am ashamed of all of you
lotte heads for the door
my dear let me assure you that when we attain power it will be much more pleasant for those inside malkovich than for those outside
lotte stops and turns
ill take my chances
do we get to wear a crown
but of course
count me in
i think its time to beckon mr
perhaps he can help us out of this pickle
flemmer a silver haired gentleman in turtleneck and blazer scratches his head
the cultists patiently watch him
boy this is a toughie
to be honest i didnt anticipate this
and as i said sir we cant very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel malkovich
i heard you the first time
im not a dummy
didnt mean to imply that you were sir
look im going back to my house to ponder this
so stay calm and keep track of schwartzs comings and goings
oh and somebody dispose of schwartzs wife will you
to cultists nice to meet you all
the cult members ad lib same here sir
lotte site in the living room in her pajamas softly sobbing
the caged animals watch her
oh my friends
be thankful youre not human
people are treacherous and greedy and corrupt
ive lost my heart to two of them and i almost lost my soul to another
and im no better
look at the way i keep you locked in cages for my own enjoyment
well ive been in a cage too my friends
literally and figuratively
so tonight i set you free
lotte opens the windows and the front door then unlocks all the cages
the animals scurry and fly out of their cages and out of the house
lotte watches silently until she is alone
good bye friends
a hand reaches for hers
she looks down
elijah is still there and holding her hand
hello friend we see the menagerie of animals on the otherwise deserted street dispersing into the night
a lone dark figure turns the corner and walks slowly up the street to craig and lottes building
lotte and elijah see the dark figure coming up the steps
the buzzer rings
lotte and elijah jump
theyve come to kill me elijah
see i know too much
i should get the door
its impolite to keep death waiting
elijah looks at her sweetly a great sadness in his eyes
then he leads her by the hand out the window
the marquee reads worlds greatest puppeteer craig schwartz and his magical puppet john malkovich
malkovich sits in a tuxedo and watches himself in the dressing table mirror
maxine in a tight black number reclines on the couch
this is it lover
youre stepping onto that stage a nobody and presto change o youre coming back the greatest puppeteer the world has ever seen
malkovich is fighting me hard today
malkovich jerks a bit gets it under control
doesnt he know how important tonight is to us
hes a selfish bastard
the house is filling with formally dressed audience members
the cultists and lester also in tuxes and gowns are among them
the lights go down
ladies and gentlemen it is the great privilege of the luxor hotel and casino to present craig schwartz and his magical puppet john malkovich
the orchestra starts up
the curtains part
malkovich tap dances out onto the stage
he is amazingly nimble and the audience oohs and aahs
grudgingly pretty good though
malkovich does an amazing triple somersault lands on one knee and with spread arms begins singing kiss today goodbye
in a beautiful tenor
the orchestra catches up with him
the audience goes wild
a pretty boy young man with a big tousle of black hair and a shiny tight suit appears at the back of the house
an usher glances over at him
we werent expecting you tonight sir
um im afraid theres not an empty seat in the entire house
not taking his eyes from the stage make one empty
y y y es sir
the usher looks nervously around for someone to boot
martini waits in the back
on stage malkovich is now performing the back of the car scene from on the waterfront
he alternates between the marlon brando part and the rod steiger part moving back and forth from one stool to the another
he performs it magnificently
we see lester in the audience wiping a small tear from his eye
not too shabby
mantini is now sitting in a good aisle seat next to a beautiful woman
her boyfriend is being hauled toward the exit by the usher
the beautiful woman watches with some concern as the boyfriend is taken away
then she turns and smiles flirtatiously at mantini
mantini smiles back
on stage malkovich is dressed in a ringmasters outfit and juggling chainsaws
nothing more than a goddamn clown
at this point the entire audience stands and gives malkovich a spontaneous standing ovation
all except mantini
even the cultists get up
lotte sits sadly in the wet tunnel
she is scrunched up against the damp cold
a small fire smolders in front of her
we hear footsteps approaching
it is elijah carrying supplies food and blankets
he covers her with a blanket and sits down next to her
theyre going to take over the world elijah
evil will reign
but then evil already reigns doesnt it
so what difference does it make if john malkovich is wearing the fucking crown while its reigning
elijah sighs then holds his stomach
the ulcer is returning
its a conservatively furnished upper westside apartment
looks like it belongs to a columbia professor
the walls are lined with books
flemmer sits at his desk his head in his hands deep in thought
the doorbell rings
the door opens and lester pokes his head in
its just me boss
i brought croissants
lester enters with a greasy white paper bag
have a seat
i wracking my brain over this malkovich thing
we saw his show at the luxor last night
whatd you think
the kids got talent
youve never seen malkovich like this
schwartz had him up there singing and dancing
those are hard
very talented son of a bitch
too bad we cant kill him
i suppose i could come to him in a dream
i dont know
thats the best i can think of right now
a scary dream
no a sexy dream
of course a scary dream
noncommittally i like that
malkovich sits on the floor in silk pajamas
he is surrounded by newspaper clippings
he is drinking champagne from the bottle
maxine is at a dressing table brushing her hair
they love me darling
craig schwartz is fantastic
the new york times
if only craig schwartz had always been inside malkovich
womens wear daily
craig schwartz the worlds greatest puppeteer
paul wunder wbai radio
its a dream come true
were going to ride this straight to the top
busy day my little fire chief
why dont you climb into bed and ill meet you there in just
but malkovich is already passed out on the floor on top of his clippings
maxine smiles maternally gets up and puts blanket over him
we stay on malkovichs face
craig wanders across a jagged rocky landscape
geysers of flame shoot up around him
the sky is red
he is frightened
he arrives at a desk
the man behind the desk is facing away from him
he swivels to face craig
it is flemmer looking the same as usual except for little red horns and a sinister grin
who are you
i am the devil
he is mine
i didnt know
malkovich awakes with a start
maxine looks over at him
bad dream darling
ive got to leave malkovich
youve got to be kidding
i just had the most horrifying nightmare
the devil was in it
flemmer crouches behind a bureau and listens
he is pleased with himself
malkovich is our meal ticket
you cant back out because of some stupid dream
to himself shit
honey we can be happy and poor together
laughs derisively perhaps youll want to consult that ouija board again
there is a knock at the door
maxine opens it angry
maxine is suddenly interested
mantini and maxine give each other the once over
still eyeing maxine hello schwartz
i saw your show
did you see the reviews
yeah i saw them because if you missed any i just happen to have copies here you can take with you when you leave now
i produced the evening with malkovich
i could use a producer with your vision
and other outstanding attributes
shes not available
well see schwartz
yeah well see schwartz
i wont waste your time schwartz or more importantly mine
heres my proposal theres only room in this world for one worlds greatest puppeteer
so lets allow the puppet going public to crown their king
how do we do that
a friendly competition if you will
your malkovich puppet and my harry s
truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play
not some vegas burly q pyrotechnics but a real play that requires actual acting
the audience decides who is more deserving of the title
the losing puppeteer bows out graciously
goes back to obscurity as a file clerk
whats the play
its got everything
never heard of it
broadways finest three hours
its about the suppression of the individual
conformity as god in modern society
are there any songs
nothing but acting to hide behind buddy boy
im not afraid
i toured for a year with the national puppet companys production of long days journey into night
is there dancing
who needs dancing
lester is watering flemmers plants
a key is heard in the door
flemmer enters a small carry on bag slung over his shoulder
howd it go
did you say the philodendron gets water or no
no for gods sake i just watered it yesterday
beat it almost went well
i gave a pretty good dream but circumstances arose
what kind of circumstances
maxine says shell leave him if he leaves malkovich plus hes been challenged to a puppet duel by mantini
the great mantini
no the mediocre mantini
of course the great mantini
oh hes good
i saw him do tru with his sixty foot robert morse puppet
but i think i have another plan
snippy do tell
i love a good plan
why are you being like this
i missed you
tell me the plan
well if mantini wins schwartz will leave malkovich right
so if he needs it i help mantinis performance a bit give him an edge
spice up the show
can you do that
i mean do you know anything about puppetry
i am the devil lester
i think i can handle it
i was just asking
no disrespect intended
lets drop it
i mean its not like i was doubting you its just that i know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire
im not mad
lets just drop it
your mails on the kitchen table
oh theres a letter from alex trebek
lotte and elijah now dirty and drawn are talking
elijah uses sign language
youve got to tell craig whats going on
he must never leave malkovich
im glad you learned sign language elijah but im tired of your nagging
im tired of this conversation
im tired period
what has the world ever done for me that i should feel personally responsible for saving it
it is better to light one candle than curse the darkness
i learned that from you
lotte turns away shaken
a tear rolls down her face
what have i become
the marquee reads derek mantinis sixty foot harry s
truman puppet and craig schwartzs actual size john malkovich puppet in peter shaffers equus
the house is packed
on stage is a minimalist set wood planks and metal poles
six guys in brown turtlenecks and stylized wire horse heads mill about
the foot harry s
truman puppet is pacing his strings extending up into the flyspace and out of sight
malkovich sits on a bench
truman and malkovich both take stabs at british accents
do you dream often
its my job to ask the questions
yours to answer them
do you dream often
we see the audience fidgeting in their seats coughing
the dialogue drones on as maxine watches coolly from the wings
she drags on a cigarette
flemmer dressed as a stagehand stands behind maxine
he also watches the actors with an occasional sideways glance at maxine
without turning around keep your eyes in your pants old timer
the lobby is crowded
maxine moves through the crowd listening to snippets of conversation
flemmer now in a tuxedo moves about also
first couple that truman puppet is downright boring as the psychiatrist
its a wooden performance really
second couple whats with the malkovich puppet
he was much better in vegas when he played the piano with his feet
i hate it when they try to stretch
its like woody allen
third couple they both stink
im going across the street to second act miss saigon
malkovich watches himself in his dressing table mirror
maxine enters flops herself down on the couch and lights up a cigarette
youd better turn on the pyrotechnics lover cause right now youre running neck and neck with the dead president
and youre both in last place
malkovich continues to watch himself in the mirror nods his head
mantini leans against a rail and smokes a cigarette
charles nelson reilly in a tuxedo confers with him in hushed tones
youre doing beautifully my boy
i wept at the speech about your wife
flemmer materializes behind mantini what the hell
mantini spins around to face flemmer
reilly makes a break for it
flemmer points a finger and reilly freezes in mid strut
flemmer then points a finger at mantini and he too freezes
flemmer picks up the giant wooden controls for the marionette and pulls a copy of the play from his pocket
we watch the second act in progress
the truman puppet pace as he delivers a monologue
somehow he doesnt even seem to be a puppet anymore so subtle and graceful are his movements and the changes in his facial expressions
its as if theres a giant actual harry truman on stage
i can hear the creatures voice
its calling me out of the black cave of the psyche
i shove in my dim little torch and there he stands waiting for me
he raises his matted head
he opens his great square teeth and says mocking why
why ultimately me
do you really imagine you can account for me
totally infallibly inevitably account for me
malkovich watches impressed and a little scared by this bravura performance
he glances out into the audience and sees a silent rapt crowd
malkovich is delivering a monologue
acting up a storm
during malkovichs speech truman repeatedly attempts to upstage him nodding his head looking thoughtful raising his ten foot eyebrows in surprise
white eyes never closed
eyes like flames coming coming
a man hole cover is pushed off
lotte climbs out onto the street
she is dirty but determined
malkovich is in convulsions on the floor
big dramatic convulsions
truman scoops him up and places him on the bench
malkovich continues with the convulsions milking it
just lie back
now breathe in deep
malkovich is breathing insanely now trying to keep the focus on himself
flemmer is in the catwalks watching the crowd
the audience is watching malkovich
to his wife that malkovich puppet is a damn fine actor
blood boiling bastard is stealing my thunder
malkovich and truman on the stage
truman is pacing swirling dancing juggling enormous bowling pins as he talks
ill take it away
hell be delivered from madness
hell feel himself acceptable
malkovich has upped his convulsions now
he watches truman out of the corner of his eye while writhing tormentedly on the bench
spins in mid air
falls on all fours and does an uncanny impression of a yelping dog
truman watches malkovich continues to speak
but now when he talks fire comes out of his mouth
ill heal the rash on his body
ill erase the welts cut into his body by flying manes
the audience ooohs at the flames
malkovich rips off his clothes and convulses into the dying swan bit from swan lake
the audience applauds
truman continues his speech now transforming himself into an actual foot swan and flying around the auditorium as he speaks
you wont gallop anymore alan
horses will be quite safe
youll save your pennies every week till you can change that scooter into a car
the audience watches the giant swan overhead necks craned in awe
he is out of his league
he goes into a remarkable tap dance routine and sings mr
bojangles but nobody even looks at the stage
the giant swan bursts into flames flies back onto the stage burns to a crisp then rises from his ashes as the actual harry s
truman looks confused and disoriented as if just raised from the dead
where am i
arent i dead
possessed vote for mantini
truman grows and grows until he is again just a giant puppet
the audience bursts into applause then delivers a standing ovation
flemmer laughs wildly in the catwalks
malkovich walks dejectedly from the stage
malkovich walks past maxine
she doesnt even look at him
thunderous applause is heard in the background
good bye maxine
malkovich drops limply to the floor
he lifts his head
weak but relieved im back
my nightmare is over
flemmer watches malkovich from above
he pulls out a walkie talkie
into walkie talkie okay now
lester is surrounded by all the malkovichians
he holds the walkie talkie has just received word
he nods and the malkovichians crawl in single file into the portal while shrieking a war cry
maxine watches as malkovich pulls himself up off the ground
suddenly he is again possessed first by one person then by two then by three his body jerking and pulsating with each new occupant
its almost like popping corn starting out slowly then going faster and faster until malkovich is possessed by all fifty malkovichians
he shrieks a war cry and runs out onto the stage
the truman puppet now hangs limply from the catwalks
malkovich hovers just above the stage and addresses the audience
now sounding like fifty voices i am your earthly king
kneel before me
the audience scoffs at first but then are compelled to their knees
like automatons hail malkovich king of the damned
malkovich laughs gives the thumbs up sign to flemmer in the catwalks
flemmer gives the thumbs up sign back
lotte appears in the back of the theater an out of breath figure in shadows
it is too late
she runs from the theater
maxine watches somewhat amused
she turns and heads for the exit
a dejected craig walks along the shoulder
he is wet and cold
we hold on him for a long while until he eventually merges with the landscape
something is wrong
its a typical midtown street but everything is painted gray the buildings the streets the sidewalks the cars
people walk along the streets carrying gray briefcases wearing gray jumpsuits
nobody talks nobody smiles
gray birds fly silently in the sky
there is no noise whatsoever
there are several movie theaters on the block
all marquees advertise john malkovich movies
around the corner comes malkovich
he is floating about ten feet off the ground on an enormous bright red jeweled throne
he wears a gold crown and purple silk robe and smiles condescendingly majestically
floris sits on his lap
she is dressed in an orange satin gown
nobody on the street looks up
fifty voices greetings my lowly subjects
great things my lonely subtext
rolls his eyes boy be careful what you wish for
to floris never mind dear
just enjoy the ride will you
floris shrugs picks at her finger nails
to the people on the street i am bored
you will dance for your king now
without pause the entire street of gray clad people breaks into a meticulously choreographed production number
totally silent totally joyless but exquisitely executed
we see that maxine is one of the anonymous dancers
her face is void of expression
faster my little trained monkeys
the crowd dances faster and faster
older people fall over exhausted clutching their hearts
nobody stops dancing to help nobody dares
birds eye view of the park
its all painted gray
every tree every leaf
theres no sign of life
the camera moves in through some gray trees and gray brush to this place is filled with life colorful birds lizards cats a rooster
all the animals are active happy but totally silent as if they know the precariousness of their position
lotte and elijah sit among them
these are the animals that she freed earlier
lotte and elijah hold hands and look into each others eyes
we see that they both wear gold bands
they are husband and wife
must you take this terrible demon on yourself my love
im the only one
i have to enter malkovich and destroy him from the inside
if not me who
if there was any way i could go in your place
but im only a monkey and
puts finger to his lips hush sweetheart
lotte slips into a gray jumpsuit
she stuffs a homemade bomb on her pocket
she and elijah kiss passionately then embrace
to the animals ill be with you always my friends
who knows maybe if im lucky ill rejoin you with wings and a beak
wings and a halo my darling
wings and a halo
lotte turns quickly
this is too much to bear
she descends into a storm drain
the animals stop what theyre doing
softly good bye
a man hole cover lifts
lotte pokes her head out
the coast is clear
assumes the dead eyed expression of the others and enters the building
lotte watches the floors change
after seven she presses the emergency stop button
the elevator jerks to a halt
she picks up the crow bar in the corner pries open the door
the floor is gone
nothing is there but pipes and wires and beams
she climbs out onto the floor
lotte searched the floor for some sign of the portal
it is nowhere to be found
there is a noise behind her
she turns with a start
its craig ragged and ill shaven
im so glad youre safe
you look really wonderful
im in love
for the first time
its funny but when it happens to you theres no question
hes a lucky man
beat do i know him
as long as youre happy
im sure hes a better lover than i ever was
a better friend
beat im sorry for everything
pecking him on the cheek its okay craig
it all worked out in an odd sort of way
you came up here looking for the portal
i was going to kill him from the inside
and yourself too in the process
god youre so beautiful
why couldnt i see that before
you saw it once
now you see it again
thats life isnt it
and you were up here to try the same thing werent you
but they got here first the lousy bastards
so now its all over i guess
i dont know
theres a small community of us
we have a place they dont know about
well keep trying to figure out a way
come stay with us
join the struggle
youll have me after all ive done to you
people make mistakes
im through with puppets lotte
i just want you to know that
id like to be a farmer
i want to help things grow to encourage life
do you and your friends need a farmer
we could really use a farmer
wed be grateful for the help
beat also i think you know if you wouldnt mind too terribly a little puppet show every once in a while would do a lot to lift our spirits
you know if you wouldnt mind too terribly
craigs eyes well up with tears
lotte looks at him sweetly
its gonna be okay
she puts her arm around him and leads him toward the elevator
i love you lotte
we come on very close to craigs arm as he lifts it to put it around lotte
we see a thin almost invisible filament
we follow it up and discover that craig is now a marionette being controlled from above by an emotionless mantini in a gray jumpsuit
in craigs voice i cant wait to see where you and your friends live lotte
its beautiful craig like eden
now we see filaments attached to mantinis arms and w follow them up to find that flemmer is controlling mantini
one serpent coming up
flemmer throws his head back and laughs
the camera moves into his mouth and down his throat which oddly enough looks exactly like the membranous john malkovich portal tunnel
music in put your hand inside the puppet head by they might be giants
it plays throughout the credits
