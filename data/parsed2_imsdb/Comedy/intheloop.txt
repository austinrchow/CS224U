well im joined by simon foster the minister for international development
thank you for joining us
here we go

page judy malloy the departments press officer is preparing for her ministers arrival
mark are you co ordinating that millenium goals press release
well co ordinate it better
yes can do
is that the minister
bloody nail has anyone got a nail file
simon is arriving with judy
simon carrying his red dispatch box
have we heard anything from malcolm about last nights interview
no not yet
perhaps he didnt hear it
or maybe hes dead
with a degree of genuine hope he might be dead
he might have had that massive stroke weve all been waiting for
its in the post
preventable sickness in many of the poorest countries round the world
and of course the big one is diarrhoea which is a major major issue
i mean this is the minister for international development
he should be talking about food parcels not fucking arse spraying mayhem
and so if we can tackle the easy things like diarrhoea then we can
oh yes say it again
what is this the shitting forecast
and then hopefully that will strike another blow in the war against preventable diseases
you mentioned the word war malcolm is paying extremely close attention now
against preventable diseases yes
all the evidence now points to a us military intervention in the middle east
is that you view
personally i think that war is unforseeable
no you do not think that
im going to have to go over to international development and pull simon fosters fucking hair
page malcolm emerges into the street
on the phone
he did not say unforseeable
you may have heard him say it but he did not say that and that is a fact
hell want you to row back from the unforeseeable thing on question time tonight
on question time you know the funny question they always ask at the end
i think we should prep that now
id like to shine on the funny question cos im a funny guy
with a light touch
simon deposits his briafcase
judy finds some clippings returns
theres this guy hes a property tycoon
hes bought a south sea island
it might be something like that you know
if you had to spend the rest of your life on a desert island who would it be with
well i cant say my wife because i havent got one and i cant say my girlfriend because i havent got one of those either
and dont say mandela thats
and a bloke
or keira knightley
well thats a good idea
i dont think so
people dont want to know
toby and suzy walking to work together
did you take the washing out of the machine
what do you mean no
i didnt take the washing out of the machine
its going to go really stale
itll be fine
its not fine
by the time
it is fine
ill wear stale pants
i dont want to go out with some who wears stale pants
well there we go
i could go commando but i dont think thats acceptable in government
so got everything you need for your first day in international development
page oh yes
its all here
my massive intellect
and an apple for simon foster
dont say that im rebranding him
well he was crap on the radio last night
he sounded like a chicken with a wasp up its arse
well im going to sort that out
after a week ill have him sounding like a chicken without a wasp up its arse
have a good day good luck honey
have a good day at the foreign office
try not to annoy russia
ill give you a call later
keep your phone on
oh and be careful cars
they walk off in separate directions
toby is walking towards dfid
as he nears the building he finds himself next to malcolm who is heading in too
toby is on the phone
are you going to keep ringing me up every two minutes because youre starting to remind me of my mum
and that could lead to all sorts of erectile dysfunction
suzy is still in the fo office
page im just checking whether you put last nights lasagne in the fridge
in the fo office michael arrives
he has a small suitcase and a paper bag
he holds this up
back with malcolm toby close by
malcs on the phone
youre fine to go ahead and print that
its lies youd be lying but go ahead
he did not say unforeseeable
no he did not
oh just before you go when i tell your wife about you and angela heaney at the blackpool conference
would email be better
or a phone call
or hey i know ill write it on a cake your hack husband betrayed you on the th of october and congratulations on the new baby in those little silver
beat yeah maybe best to spike it
toby is now next to malcolm in the building or better still in a lift
malcolm becomes aware of him
no its fine its in the fridge
i put some clingfilm over it
in the fo office michael switches on some classical music
why did you put clingfilm on it
to keep it fresh
malcolm starts dialling on his phone
its in the fridge thatll keep it fresh
no but it still might dry out
into phone yeah malcolm tucker
can i speak to james lewis at the pm programme please
page michael hands suzie a croissant
knowing toby is on the other end of the line still slightly warm
thats how i like my women as well
clingfilm is carcinogenic toby
no it isnt
thats a myth
clingfilm is perfectly safe
malcolm now eyeing toby with suspicion contempt who is this dick
toby tries to smile lowers his voice embarrassed
into phone no ill hold
whats he waiting for
a sex change
they wouldnt sell clingfilm if it gave you cancer
clingfilm doesnt give you cancer
and lasagne doesnt give you syphillis
right simon foster
yeah very funny the diarrhoea of a nobody
listen we get an easy ride on tom tomorrow ok
getting annoyed no you relax
tell you what ill come over a lock you in a flotation tank and pump it full of sewage until you drown
get me fucking brian
simon and judy are still prepping the funny question
are you serious
page the olson twins
judy gets a call
she rings off
sensing somethings up what
malcolms coming to see you
hes still alive
whens he due
malcolm walks in with toby sheepishly behind him
and dont say you werent prepared because i rang ahead
to judy give us a minute will you love
judy gets up as malcolm turns back to simon in the words of the late great nat king fucking cole unforeseeable thats what you are
judy has spotted toby
whatever your name is dan the new advisor
just most of you lot tend to be called dan or danny so its always worth a punt
as you know im judy molloy civil service director of communications for international development
they shake hands
page is this a normal morning or
judys not got time for questions
okay ive got a meeting in looks at watch two minutes
and the minister was rubbish in last nights interview
its a technical term
it means he went on the radio and everyone could hear that he was rubbish
someone goes into simons office
as door opens we hear heated conversation between simon and malcolm
you sounded like a panicky chimp trapped in a washing machine
back inside simons office
come on malcolm he asked me for a personal opinion
oh why didnt you say
i mean he asked you
of course that explains it
say if hed asked you to fucking black up or give him your pin number or shot yourself would you have done that as well
i would have blacked up
it was the radio and no one would have known
but war is basically unforeseeable isnt it
that is not our line alright
walk the fucking line
page weve got karen clark over from washington okay
weve got the us national security advisors main guy coming
weve got enough pentagon goons here for a fucking coup detat
this is not the time to send out a signal like this in some personal fucking sodcast
judy and toby come in
minister this is toby
not the time love
judy smiles at malcolm and doesnt fuck off
glad you could join us
bit of an odd morning but welcome to the madhouse
i apologise for malcolm
dont apologise for me
you should apologise for yourself
to judy did i not just tell you to fuck off and yet youre still here
to toby hey foetus boy
lesson one if i tell you to fuck off what do you do
youll go far
now fuck off
toby fucks off
we can see him outside wandering around not knowing what to do with himself
we were thinking werent we judy that i could row back on question time tonight
no youre not going on question time tonight
youve been disinvited
weve been prepping question time
because they ask fucking questions on question time
and youre no good at questions
if it was fumbling off message shit fucking answer time youd be our main guy
but its not
sorry why wasnt i told about this
why should i tell you about this
because its a scheduled media appearance by this departments secretary of state and it therefore falls within my purview
where do you think you are sweetheart in some regency costume drama
this is a government department not a fucking jane austen novel
allow me to pop a jaunty little bonnet on your purview and ram it up the shitter with a lubricated horse cock
malcolm your swearing doesnt impress me
my husband works for tower hamlets and believe me those kids make you sound like angela lansbury
to simon lads chat shes married
the poor bastard
okay judys lubricated horse cock aside for one moment
judy walks out are you saying that im now not allowed to make any media appearances
no not until we can trust you to keep to the line
but i was going to keep to the line i dont actually think war is unforeseeable
page malcolms looking out of the office monitoring judys movements
shes flashed up on his radar
hes tracking her
what is it then
i dont know
thats fucking declaring war
do you want to fucking declare war
im a cabinet minister
i didnt get here by screwing up every media appearance i ever had
write this down
its neither forseeable nor undorseeable
so not inevitable but not
malcolm leaves the office
toby is still hovering
calling back to simon okay you need to work on this fucking line
to judy that includes you jane fucking austen with the strap on
oh and put the sniff out there that the next time the bbc ambushes a minister with a war question well drop a bomb on them
i cant do that
thats political thats not in my
purview marie antoinette
weel listen darling why dont you fucking scuttle off back to fucking cranford and play around with your tea and cake and horse cocks
let them eat cock
to toby you ron weasley you do it
malcolm heads out
page suzy and michael in michaels office
suzys getting documents together for the big meeting
michaels at his computer on the phone
classical music still on
on phone you neednt worry about the canadians
theyre just happy to be there
pause yes well they always look surprised when theyre invited
listen shall i just give toby a quick call about the simon foster thing
toby checks the phone
sees its suzy christ not her again im a bit busy here
you do know this is the third time youve rung
are you on a new tariff
hows it going
you found the bogs yet
all a bit manic
it was never like this at agriculture
people tend not to swear so much about wheat
apart from farmers
they swear about everything
to michael re
the music can you turn that down a bit
to toby look ive got a leg up for you
i think we could get simon into the big meeting with karen clark
right karen clark from
is that the woman who went round britain in a coracle for leukemia
page karen clark us assistant secretary of state
hang on michael wants to say something
simons only going to be meat in the room
dont get his hopes up
yeah so you know simon between us hes just going to be meat in the room
judy nearby hears this
waving him away yeah
the americans dont feel theyre getting a real meeting unless theres thirty of you on each side
so simon is
you know those polystyrene peanut things they use to pack electrical goods
sort of one of those
but you might not want to tell him that
i ought to go
i love you
judys hovering nearby
affirmative on that
judy is hovering as toby finishes his call
so quick tour
she starts walking away
um i do just need to
page over there
thats mikes patch
leave mike to it
he knows what hes doing
dont you mike
as they walk on hes an idiot
he organised tents and sanitation packs for rwanda
is that not
they needed them in luanda
its been in the news
checks phone and thats the end of the tour
ive got to go
look i understand your hostility to new wood coming in
theres a lot of really important people you need to know about but i havent got time
but shes gone
toby heads over to simons office
the doors open
he pops his head in
sorry about earlier malcolm
hes a bit of an
alpha male isnt he
look ive managed to get you into the big meeting at the foreign office this afternoon
the karen clark meeting
how did you
i did it through sheer bloody hard work
judy walks past
simon calls out
page hey judy
she comes in
tobes here has got me into the big karen clark meeting
judy looks at toby
she heard the meat conversation
yeah the big meet
how are you spelling that by the way
simon toby and judy drive along whitehall in their car
an awkward silence
judy looks at toby
she knows simons just off to be meat
off judys look just maybe might be best not to get too excited
it might be that their guys muscle in and have the lions share of the talk time
it might be like that
i think i can work a room okay
im not a room virgin
simon toby and judy are going through security
suzy and michael come to meet them
page a very young man approaches michael
looks like he is
he is chad
wed like a dual horse shoe formation for the meeting set up an enclave for ms clark an enclave for the pentagon delegation
first names acceptable to all parties and politely we request the presence of both carbonated and non carbonated waters
thanks so much
he walks purposefully off
who was that young lankenstein
oh hell be running something relatively major
theyre all kids in washington
its like bugsy malone but with real guns
chads dual horse shoe is packed with people
the rooms pretty much full
karen clark from the state department is surrounded by ten or so aides and functionaries security people and assistants
including chad and liza one of karens senior aides
then there is bob adrianos gang of advisors smaller but sitting separately
next to them is a pentagon delegation including uniformed members of all three services
lots of hubbub
suzy leads simon toby and judy in and shows them to their seats
page theyre as far away from the us delegation as its possible to be and simons seat is actually behind a pillar
suzy goes off to join michael and the foreign office delegation near the front
suzy looks over to toby uses her hands to make mock binoculars as if to say youre very far away look how close and therefore important i am
no one will hear me if i say anything
hows your view
can we swap
simon and toby swap seats but simon can still barely see anything
to judy can i swap with you
i think the meetings starting
well quickly then swap
simon and judy swap seats
the meeting is now underway
were with karen clark
we all agree this is a very tough time but i dont want a consensus to form around the premise that conflict is necessarily the primary option at this point
back with simon judy and toby
simon still straining to see
are people thinking that
thats a bit hardcore
he cranes again to see
no this is worse
simon and judy swap seats again
back with karen
shes holding up a paper in a red folder
page this paper authored by one of my aides liza weld
you dont mind me fore grounding this do you liza
in a big meeting
is this good or bad
illuminates the logistical factors we face
she highlights a number of reasons why in practical terms we cant envision a theatre deployment for twelve months
although not everyone might agree with the assumptions made in that paper
really such as what
the committee feels a much quicker deployment is possible
covering this has been discussed in a number of committees
if i said one committee
then that was a slip of the tongue have you accidentally alluded to some secret committee
a war committee
if i can interject here im aware were pushed for time
id like to move us on agenda wise
our next item is international relief co ordination
karen is conferring with liza adriano with his guy
have you heard of this committee
whats this liza weld paper
page simon is watching feeling the meeting is passing him by
to judy and toby should i say something
she invited me i should say something
if you dont say something in the first minutes you can end up not saying anything at all
i dont know whether you should say anything
im saying something
i think im going to try saying something
simon goes to put his hand up toby maybe puts a calming hand on his hand
they look at one another
has toby crossed a line
look i just think its worth noting that ministers in the uk government liza whispers simons over there such as our colleague here
pleased is she talking about me
shes talking about me
has made it clear that for them currently war is unforeseeable
isnt that right simon
well yes i mean thats what i said
and i stick to what i said
simon sits down
them stands back up
but that doesnt mean that what i said wont ever change
its not imutable
its an ongoing
page cutting in i wonder if there arent some area of mutual agreement we cant rattle through here and see how much time we have at the end for this
hes ended the debate
suzy comes round the back of the meeting all smiles and hands judy a note with a smile
she opens the note it reads simon is acting like a massive tit
is that all fine
thats all fine
thanks for that
toby whispers something in simons ear
simon doesnt look pleased
karen is still talking to the meeting
simon shuts up
hell have this out later
the big meeting is breaking up
simon is annoyed leading judy and toby out of the room and into any private space he can find they back into a huge huge ballroom come here we need
to talk they go into the massive room look around what do you mean stop being a tit
in what way was i being a tit
why am i even over here if im not meant to say anything
you were just meat in the room simon
meat in the room
oh for fucks sake judy
i took an hour out to come over here and be room meat
page but you know youre a prime cut youre not offal
great im not liver
what was i tit meat
were with karen clarks delegation who have just walked downstairs from the meeting room into a ground floor lobby area
karen is talking to liza her right hand woman
toby simon and judy are above them standing round a circular viewing area that looks down on the lobby
the uk and us delegations are aware of each other throwing furtive glances each others way
whichever committee they dont want me to be a member of i want to be a member of that
its a confused groucho marx
karen talks to someone else
your paper got a major citation
you must be psyched karen brought it up
that was her call
i didnt know it had been that widely read
you could not write anything that clashes more violently with the current climate than you the one you wrote if you were trying and it almost seems like you were
i wasnt trying believe me
you are like the woman from the omen youve given birth to a demon and its going to kill you
page you probably identify with the kid from the omen right
see youre an only child arent you
you bring this up whenever you run out of arguments
i dont see how my parents limited reproductive abilities reflects badly on me
im the sperm that made it
liza walks off over to karen
have fun with your career kryptonite
re karen talking conspiratorially to liza downstairs whats that all about
it looks important
karen is back huddled up with liza
my teeth hurt
i think the veneers are chipped
do they look chipped
liza stares into karens mouth
well i think that one that ones always been there right
im not sure
have you got any painkillers
oh dont look at my teeth
trying to earwig sshhh
page looking up at the brits off simons smile i dont want to risk a dentist here
the us delegation are heading off shouting hey liza
she knows him but cant immediately place him
she makes the phone sign
he gives a thumbs up she thinks hes misread the phone sign and gestures or email by doing typing in the air
toby signs back yeah call on the phone or email does the typing back
re the typing gesture what are you doing
you look like youre practicing baby massage
she did the kennedy scholarship at my college
i had a small thing for her
i can imagine
im not sure she remembered me
no that is one of the side effects of rohypnol
page linton has set up a secret war committee i just know it
i mean linton is an absolute lunatic liza
he is dangerous
the voices in his head are now singing barbershop together
the conversation is continuing between simon judy and toby as they exit the fo
i really really hope theres not a war
its going to be a nightmare
its bad enough having to cope with the fucking olympics
they appear outside
theres a press pack of or so reporters and photographers there
simon is taken aback
who let the dogs out
we dont need this
er you wanted a chance to row back on the war
do you want to nail the line
ill freestyle it
the press are calling
is war unforeseeable minister
look grappling now loads of things that are actually very likely are also unforeseeable
yknow for the plane in the fog the mountain is unforeseeable but then it is suddenly very real and inevitable
toby and judy look at one another
this isnt good
page the press pack are looking for more
sorry are you saying that
what im saying is that to walk the road of peace sometimes you need to be ready to climb the mountain of conflict
the press are writing furiously making calls already
simon tries to look confident
he and the team get into their car
toby simon and judy on the back seat as they drive back to the department
under his breath fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
to judy why didnt we nail the line
i did try to warn you
you did try to warn me but you didnt actually stop me did you
thats like shouting train
as i get hit by a train
you should go stupid voice look
theres a fucking train
judys and simons phones start ringing
they each check the number
its malcolm for me too
how does he do that
he answers tentatively hello
page malcolm has two phones on the go
hes watching the sky news coverage of simons mini press coverage
it has a government ready to climb the mountain of conflict banner running across the top
on the phone over tv simon
i dont like finding out about people i work with via the news unless theyve died
get over here now so we can address at least one of those issues
judy simon and toby are walking towards malcolms office
the thing is
on the war
with your profile
uncertain but fuck it he is a senior policy aide to a cabinet minister maybe we should get it out there
that the war is a resigning issue for you
you cant say its a resigning issue
because you then have to resign
you are having a really great first day you know that
they walk in malcolms there
shouting you are supposed to be a cabinet minster
you are supposed to be officer class
dont do this
dont make waves
we can do without the ritual humiliation malcolm
you know im against talking up the war
youre against talking up the war
is that why you said climb the mountain of conflict
page do you know what you sounded like
you sounded like a fucking nazi julie andrews
im just saying
i might be forced to the verge of making a stand
different tack needed at toby and judy right you two the white stripes outside
simon makes to leave with them
theres only two people in the white stripes
toby and judy leave and wait outside the door
look i admire you i really do
making a stand
so i take it i can tell the pm you dont want to go to washington
the boss wants you over there on a fact finder
problems we might face if it all goes boombastic in the middle east
but you were saying you are on the verge of your stand
well look i dont know what words i used in the heat of the moment but maybe in a sense i was on the verge
but thats the important thing i was on the verge
not in any way decided
christ on a bendy bus simon stop being such a faffing fuck arse
i am standing my ground on the verge
page well when you go to america talk to karen clarke at the state department ill give it a whirl
but keep away from linton barwick
hes pushing the war for caulderwoods lot
ill deal with him
keeps a live hand grenade as a paperweight
i wont talk to him
talk to as few people as possible
that would be best for you
liza karen and chad arrive in the buzzing state department offices knackered but in action mode
okay so priorities are take a shower get me on lintons war committee get me a dental appointment
not necessarily in that order
karen walks past various desks covered in tons of post its
stops a staffer as he passes
karen contd contd whats linton been up to while weve been away
have we declared war on california yet
but before the staffer can answer they run right into linton
karen stands her ground
how was london
great hotel thank you
page good meetings
we had some good discussions
the time at number ten could possibly have been better spent but then
karen realises that linton is reading a message on his cell phone and not listening
ill read your words when they come through
thank you so much linton heads off to his office
a beat later so does karen
chad goes off a little towards lintons office
is chad coming
watching hes doing his desperate chorus girl thing hanging around trying to catch lintons eye
thats why hes wearing his push up bra today
as he passes assistant secretary of state hi
chad uh huh
exactly can i
linton ignores him as he goes to join bob adriano waiting for him in his office
so listen liza i need you to find out the names of the ten dullest committees currently operating on the hill
page because linton is not going to call it the big horrible scarey war committee
theyll have buried the war committee under the most boring name they can think of
diverse strategy committee not that im on that
but itll be a committee that sounds so tedious you want to self harm
they glance over into lintons area
he is glancing into theirs
can you get me general miller at the pentagon
as she leaves my teeth hurt like hell
to herself sick of hearing about the teeth
liza goes to her desk picks up her landline
liza contd contd hi
im calling from karen clarks office about a paper written by a staffer here
we need to know if post war planning parameters implications and possibilities has reached assistant secretary of state linton barwick yet
by liza weld
its already been given an acronym
listens no i dont want to fast track it
would it possible to slow track it
well can we create one
looking over at karen
now alone who is still stealing glances over
i do not understand why anyone would choose to work in a glass office
in my opinion glass offices are for perverts
i could request the glass be frosted
page as if bob adriano brought it up frosting is for cakes bob
what happened in london
karen flagged a report by one of her staffers liza
shes obviously trying to use it as some kind of roadblock
its called pwip pip
what is that a report on birdcalls
what does that stand for
i dont recall
intel case for and against intervention
weve got all the facts we need on this
in the land of truth my friend the man with one fact is king
you said there was another thing
in the meeting with the foreign office the committee was accidentally briefly alluded to
putting his hand over his mouth so he cant be lip read which committee
doing the same the war committee
karen must not find out about that
she is an excitable yapping she dog
okay get the minutes of the meeting we need to correct the record
we can do that
page yes we can
theyre an aide memoir for us
so they should not be a reductive record of what happened to be said but a more full record of what was intended to be said
i think thats the more accurate version right
bob adriano is going through the minutes with linton
i dont like this section
i dont think this is really what france are saying
lets change that
and lets reverse this
thats something karen said
its not right
and i like this
lets say everyone agreed with this
judys in her office on the phone laughing
simons eyeing her suspiciously
whats she so fucking happy about
is she laughing at me
judy closes the blinds on her side of the office
simon contd contd whys she got control of the blinds
im a government minister
i should have blinds
page joking you want me to order some blinds
or i could get some heavy curtains with swags and a pelmet
can we go somewhere else
they walk to box room
my team for the us
im thinking of taking you and leaving judy
i could work with that definitely
plus she can be a bit
everythings a bit shit isnt it
so youre the president
and im supposed to be impressed by that
my husband works in tower hamlets
thats much harder than being president
shes staying behind
go and tell her
karen liza and linton are among those seated round the table
various staffers are standing including chad
and bob adriano
which brings us on to any other business
i believe ive flagged everything i needed to discuss
as i usually do
page putting her hand over her mouth mocking lintons gesture from earlier or everything youre prepared to discuss
what is that karen i understand youve started up a new committee whats it called
what makes you think that
it was mentioned in our london meeting
you must have misheard
i misheard the word committee
maybe it was another word
youre sitting on a new khomeini
there are a lot of words karen
itty is not a word bob
thank you james chad
why dont you just recap for me all the committees that youre currently sitting on
page im sorry karen you appear to be bleeding from your mouth
but she doesnt want to leave the meeting
oh dont try to change the subject linton
looking at karen oh no
holy mother of
everyone is just looking at her
i dont mean to be rude karen but that is a tad
i cant concentrate on what youre saying
you have blood coming out of your teeth and thats not right
karen gets up to go
its awkward shes boxed in and has to clamber over the others to get to the door
okay liza come with me
aside to liza go buffy you belong to the vampire queen now
liza follows karen out
chad takes lizas seat
i dont like to see a woman bleeding from the mouth
it makes me think of country and western music
which i really cant abide
linton sees his chance to take advantage of karen being out of the room
actually while were on any other business i do have a few points id like to resolve
page they head into the bathroom
liza is pulling handfuls of tissue
handing them to karen who is dabbing her teeth
where are at you at with the committees
i got it down to two
the aims and policy alignment committee
here put some down your front you dont want it to go down your
and the future planning committee
well its not the first one
i set that one up
does that really sound dull to you
i thought that was a good name
right no it is a good name
okay find out if it is definitely the future planning committee
right listen i might go and do that
youre not going to shout at me if i go and do that are you
im not a fucking monster liza okay
will you stop implying im some kind of monster
liza heads out of the toilets to see bob adriano ahead quite a long way
bob adriano stops and turns
liza sprints and catches up with him
page so listen bob theres something i really want to tell you
were having a hunk of the month competition and i just didnt want you to be feel
objectified in any way
and hopes it might be a come on
karen knows about the future planning committee
bob adriano looks shocked tries to cover it up
i have no idea what youre talking about
runs back into the toilets and gives a thumbs up to karen
simon and toby walking past the queues at us immigration they are being ushered through a separate channel by airport workers and diplomatic staff
as theyre escorted simon and toby catch each others eye
this is cool

your military hardware is impressive

he types so the current number of combat troops available for an invasion according to these figures would be
he presses the equals button twelve

twelve thousands about how many are going to die
and you really need a few guys alive at the end of a war or it looks like youve lost
tomorrow ive got to meet these brits

i was watching that
malcolm looks at him
i have to have a word with you
you might want to slip into your negligee
toby heads out
page toby and liza sit in a booth
they are by far the most formally dressed people in the club
a band are playing angry rock with a vaguely political message
a small knot of people are rocking out
re the mosh pit you see those guys
the mosh pit
yes i dont think ive ever seen a more civilised mosh pit its more of a mosh caucus actually
house staffers senators interns most of them are half man half pdf file
tonight they rage hard
tomorrow they go back to the hill and argue noise reduction legislation
theyre chuckling having a good time
beat looks at her
shes been mulling on something else entirely its pwip pip
a person or a cell phone tarrif or
its my paper
on the war
pros and cons of the war
but i came up with too many cons
the pro war guys have started calling me connie
so yes im fucking worried
my careers on the line

im perceptive like that
cant think of anything else dont worry
okay this place blows
what are you doing
page well im incredibly tired
it feels like my brains eight hours behind but my livers hours ahead
you dont want to come back to my place for a quick catch up
its an alluring offer
however due to technological developments i no longer need sleep but am physically rejuvenated by alcohol
he guzzles from his beer bottle as they leave
toby and liza are on the bed together kissing
could i just say you know that what happens in washington stays in washington
yeah i live in washington
so that doesnt really work for me
malcolm is still in simons room
simon sneaks the remote and flips from the news back to the shark doc
malcolm without looking up picks up the remote and flicks back to the news
we are under enormous pressure simon
karen will want you to say war is unforeseeable
linton will want you to talk up climbing the mountain of conflict
you say nothing okay
you cant swing both ways youre not david fucking bowie
can i go to bed now
no were going to run that through
am i being tortured
page toby wakes up
his mouth is parched
he feels terrible
he rolls over
liza is gone
he cant remember where he is or whats going on
then with a flash as he looks at the clock
he remembers a lot of things in a rush and springs out like a ninja and starts pulling his clothes on while scrabbling for his phone
he heads down stairs out of the apartment
hello i need a number for a taxi in washington dc

er no problem
they start to get up not quite sure whats going on

simon and toby walk out into a larger office
they find a couple of seats left out for people waiting and sit down
various staffers come and go picking up papers and files saying hi looking knackered all drinking either diet cokes or coffees
toby i dont want to read you the riot act here but i am going to have to read some extracts from the riot act
like section paragraph clause
dont leave your boss twisting in the wind and then burst in late smelling like a pissed seaside donkey

liza comes out passes by

everyone is so hot for your paper

youre in hot water
i dont feel that
its by degrees
i smell lobster
can you smell lobster toby
simon calls toby back over

toby goes back to simon page so how far would you go with linton you freaky little stalker
or all the way up brokeback mountain
malcolm is arriving into a meeting room set up with water etc with a young man who looks like an intern a

malcolm looking around as if things arent right

he gives aj his coat
doesnt take coat then eventually does and just puts it on a chair not the coat stand sure sure if we get started ill get my assistant to bring us

i was led to believe i was attending the war committee
yes assistant secretary of state linton barwick wanted me to brief you on the work of the future planning committee
i dont want the bullshit son i want the bull
no one sidelines me
malcolm gets up grabs his coat
an even younger guy wheels in a coffee trolley
and here we go the fucking vice president has also graced us with his presence
malcolm runs out on the phone
malcolm runs out of the white house
judy power walking jogging on the phone to malcolm
where is the fucking war committee meeting
simons going to the war committee i thought you knew
i thought i was going to the war committee
tell me where the fuck its happening
page its on the th floor in room
beat oh malcolm do you like how im telling you whats going on where you are
well let me tell you whats going on where you are sweet heart a certain vinegar faced maniplulative cowbag is about to find that shes out of a fucking job
judy hangs up
simon and toby are looking through magazines and papers
karen is exiting her office with an entourage
here she comes shit look like were meeting look like were having a meeting
as she passes re magazine and if you look
at the line they take in newsweek thats very much
see you at the committee
like hes busy yeah yeah sure see you in a mo
just finishing off some stuff
to toby loud okay were all done there
toby looks at him
as they get up and follow her at speed tripping to keep up
quiet i dont think you can say that anymore here
they dont like that
dont lose them
page they follow karen around a corner and she disappears into a set of doors they follow her through but it is the vestibule before a toilet door
karen looks at them
are you joining me or shall i see you there
see you there
i dont need to
do any of the things you need to go in there to do so ill just see you there
karen goes into the toilet
simon and toby head off looking sheepish
as they head out of the vestibule
there is a gaggle of karen hangers on
chad type staffers looking to get in with karen
linton is with adriano quietly horrified by all these people
general miller passes them
for millers benefit we seem to be overrun with insurgents here bob
hi im in seat row w
will i be able to see the big screen from there
oh and can i get one of those big pointy foam hands with go monster trucks
written on it
the general is on rare form very rare form
toby spots his hero
there he is
general george miller
there he is
page but the room is rapidly filling with bodies and din
more and more people are turning up
tobys view of miller is obscured
thats the second time in hours ive had a partially obscured view of him
linton calls the over stuffed standing room only room to order
okay due to the fact that seemingly everyone in the world who owns a suit has turned up for this meeting well be relocating to a bigger room
so if you will be so kind
the committee members file out
malcolm is legging it down the street
the committee members file in
miller goes close up to linton
just so you know karen and i did not appreciate having to sneak around like mulder and scully trying to find out about this committee
well youre both here now
john and yoko
you and i need to talk mano a mano cocks on the block about how things are operating around here at the moment
linton not fazed by this
how about tomorrow my office
general miller takes his seat
linton turns on adriano
what the hell happened
i have no idea how they all heard sir
there must have been a leak
general miller is sitting next to karen
theyre watching linton having angry words with adriano
look at adriano
he looks like hes with his daddy sorry bob youre adopted
from a couple with hereditary heart defects
and your mother only ever kept your baby clothes for the purposes of voodoo
simon is sitting with toby marvelling at the numbers of people cramming into the room
im room meat again
this is a massive abattoir of room meat
stay outside tobes i need a guy on the outside
make friends with chad that boy from the shining
he knows stuff
i want to stay in here with miller
dont make me pump chad
im making you pump chad
toby gets up to leave
itll be easy peasy lemon squeezy
no it wont
itll be difficult difficult lemon difficult
toby reluctantly leaves trying to grab another peek at miller
page malcolm running like a madman
everyone is finally assembled
the room has thirty or so people in it
so welcome to this somewhat engorged session of the future planning committee
you can all see an agenda
people are looking at their agendas low level chatter pouring of water etc
a general pre meeting feel
assistant secretary here on point it feels like theres an assumption that well be invading
should we talk about the practical
i mean this is the war committee after all
its the future planning committee
unofficially its known as the war committee
well unofficially we can call anything whatever we like
he holds up a water glass unofficially this is a shoe
but its not a shoe karen its a glass of water and this is the future planning committee
malcolm is running down the corridor
he runs into room
karen is talking
page but what im asking is has a decision been reached in principle to advocate invasion
thats way off agenda karen
although it would seem a general consensus may be forming
what makes you say that
well i noted with interest the recent comments of our colleague simon foster in that regard
simon is texting under the desk and not really paying full attention
he hears his name looks up waves to the group
he doesnt clock karens intense look that says you are going to rebut that arent you
foster would have something to say about that
politely im just
watching with interest
in britain we have a saying for complicated situations such as this which is that its he cant believe hes going to say this difficult difficult lemon difficult
he goes back to his text
as i say it seems a consensus is forming
furious thats just ridiculous
you have no basis for saying that
karen please calm down
we dont want you to have another hemorrhage
page its lunchtime
lots of staffers have left their desks
a few are eating sandwiches at their desks or reading a newspaper during lunch
chad is emailing reading multi tasking from a corner of desk near lintons office
so do you want to go out and get some lunch
are you kidding
lunchtime is work time
yes what an incredibly depressing motto
you see youre playing into the hands of the french saying that
toby mooches around peers in lintons office
he spots a couple of a sheets of paper that have been printed out with climb the mountain of conflict
across them as an encouraging slogan on the wall
looking in jesus
yeah work hours are too valuable for networking
you gotta get in at like work till
then start making those connections baby
he clicks his fingers rapidly annoyingly emails and admin at lunch
see if you can play some strategic racquetball through the pm
then in the six till midnight slot chow down on some serious policy work
and what friends family novels sexual inter course youre going to save those for your thirties and forties
malcolm arrives at the committee just as people are spilling out
hes pissed off
follows linton into bathroom
are you fucking me about
page mr tucker isnt it
you might pull this kind of stunt on some young wank fresh up from oklahoma happy to be getting his hookers paid for by tobacco lobbyists but not me
what seems to be the problem
ive just had a briefing from a year old finalist in americas got talent
i think he may have been a ventriloquist
or possibly the fucking dummie
he is one of my top guys
stanton college prep harvard
hes smart and hes great at his job
his fucking briefing notes were written in alphabetti spaghetti
when i left i nearly tripped over his umbilical cord
im sorry if it troubles you that our people achieve excellence at a young age
simon is emerging
linton takes malcolm to one side out of simons earshot
by the way your prime minister informs me that hes tasked you with collating some fresh british intel for us
yeah apparently your fucking master race of gifted toddlers cant quit get the job done in between breast feeds and playing with their power rangers
so yeah were getting some actual grown ups to bail you out
simon gets closer
linton moves in
to simon minister thank you so much for your support and your recent climb the mountain of conflict comment great
were going to run with that it has great repeatability
page thanks very much but
its all a bit complex really in terms of my
linton pulls away starts walking off
its early days my friend
all roads lead to munich
he smiles and walks off
what the fuck does that mean
all roads lead to munich
well it just means
i guess i dont know what it means
all roads lead to munich
malcolm is pissed off looks around
he is not the centre of attention
hes feeling cut out
come on lets go get back to the hotel nick as many coat hangers as you can
were off back to london
malcolm toby and simon are heading towards their car
they see the washington monument in the distance
if you pull it out america deflates
dont mock that
the closest youll come to getting one of those is buying a toblerone
looks at blackberry mark hadleys dads died
should we send mark a card
nah ill send him a ouija board so they can keep in touch
page so what are we getting back to
apart from a nice cup of tea and some knife crime
constituency surgery in northampton
great meeting my constituents
its like being simon cowell but without the ability to say fuck off youre mental
toby and simon are with simons constituency agent roz shes ushering them into the small damp little constituency office
rozs arm is in a sling jo scanlons arm actually is in a sling and she has difficulty opening the door to simon sorry could you
you just need to kick the bottom quite hard
simon kicks the bottom of the door to unstick it
roz opens the door
there are a few constituents waiting to see simon he nods a hello
roz has gone ahead this is to toby look at them
they all have that smell
like a charity shop you know
to constituents afternoon
a couple of the waiting constituents respond
they go through to another little office
right here you go youre pretty booked up theres a list on the desk
im just going to have a look at the guttering
im just back from america so it was pretty tough to make it up here but you know
how was the president
page shes heading off
and what was the white house like
blown up by spaceships
general miller aides up stairs general miller and an aide or two
marches into linton and karens section of state
hes got a meeting scheduled
hes a man on a mission
he marches straight past bob adriano
by way of explanation twelve thirty
um hold on general
and into lintons office
but its empty
what the fuck
yeah secretary linton barwick wanted me to let you know his last meeting looks like its over running
he sends apologies
miller stands there for a beat
very very annoyed
he stood me up
theyre better be a fucking good reason
like hes dead
that is just plain fucking rude
i mean how would he like it if i just did a big hairy shit on his desk
youre very w welcome to wait we have newspapers and periodicals
page he gestures to a seating area
miller picks up a magazine
rolls it up looks at bob adriano
might miller possibly hit him
yeah well excuse me if at this time of national crisis i dont sit with a thumb up my ass flipping through time magazine eating pop tarts
he heads off fast not quite sure where hes going calls back as he goes tell him to call me
but he might not get through cos im a fucking busy man
he finds himself heading into karens office
he stands there for a beat
shuts the door
picks up a hole punch
kicks the couch
karen enters surprised to find him there
hey what is it
yeah can i hang around in here for a while
do i need a fucking reason
beat calming down lintons playing me like a fucking turkey drumstick on a big bass drum
look i was going to order food do you want to eat
order us some cute mammals
a lamb or a piglet so i can snap its fucking neck
simon listens behind a desk
roz is there taking notes
toby is in the corner working on a laptop
page my point is if the septic tank if we didnt know it was there in the first place how can we be responsible for it now
its under the communal drive
why should we get it pumped
looking through the paperwork well its not a council sceptic tank so theyre not legally obliged to pump it
look according to the paperwork theres four metric tons of of shit under there
thats not all me is it
im not a flipping elephant am i
no of course not
nor should you be treated like one
okay mrs mcdairmid
leave it with me
im sure there must be a way through this
mrs kendrick heads out
er colin lowe
still on about bendy buses
tell him no
toby closes the laptop
pauline michaelsons son about the constituency office wall
toby exits to get coffee as roz brings in paul as he enters hi thanks for seeing me mr
hi paul call me simon
youve met roz
page i know i have
okay simon ill try to keep it brief because i can see youre a busy man
theres a bloke out there wants to make it illegal to talk in a foreign language in shops
yes well this place can become a magnet for the mentally dispossessed
and for sensible people like yourself paul
why dont you explain your issue mr michaelson
sorry is this a joke
how many times
for the fourth f
as to an idiot the side wall
of this property
is falling over
on to my mums garden
she called you up but she got fobbed off by your people
because shes not lord snooty in his posh car
because shes not madonna on a horse
i agree its unacceptable
toby comes back in hands simon a coffee
do you know what this is
he hums something irritating thats your constituency office hold music
i dont want it in my head do i
checks notes we did arrange to get a quote from a builder but
roz has a call on the landline
page patch from london
they say its urgent
is she the coracle woman
paul i really need to take this but i havent forgotten about you okay
no well im not going anywhere simon
you wont be able to forget me because ill be sitting here staring at you
toby can i hand paul over to you
can i fob paul off with you
simon goes elsewhere in the room to take his call
so paul where are we up to
off pauls scary look i was out getting coffee
he grabs a pen and paper
general miller is with karen
theyre surrounded by cartons of chinese take out
flicking through lizas paper see this is the problem with civilians wanting to go to war
when youve been there you dont want to go back unless you absolutely have to
its like france
re the paper in its red folder you finally read lizas paper
course i read it
im a voracious reader
im the fucking gore vidal of the pentagon
pointing at a spring roll you dont want that
page yes i want that
points to various packages i want that that that that and that
those i dont care about
and these lets pack up and drop on north korea
beat reads someone should leak this
outside liza sees them discussing her paper animatedly
it doesnt look good to her
someone maybe shaped a little bit like you
are you kidding
you have more gravitas
im too senior
i cant leak
leaking is for people like your liza and the boy called it out there
eats its insane
not only is the case against war incredibly strong the case for is caveated to hell
reading most analysts believe the state is looking to expand aggressively beyond its borders
then here in the caveats the only source is ice man a possible alcoholic whos probably called that cos he gets through ten bags icebergs a day in his fucking
inr say we cant trust him
thats us disputing our own findings
has linton read this
im not sure he reads
youre a general
have him killed
you see this is why we never got together
that and the hobo teeth
simon is talking to karen
page this is a private call right unrecorded secure line etc etc
i mean your lot are probably getting it somehow but our lot shouldnt be
paul michaelson calls over
im still here simon
whats going on simon
about a wall
what can i do for you
where were you in the committee
i called for back up you sat there like a dumb sack of shit
maybe worse cos at a molecular level a bag of shit is probably fizzing with energy
well i have to say karen i have a clear strategy here
im playing the long game
there is no long game
theyve bounced us into a short game
you looked like a
what do you call it in england

paul look mate
but im on your side
i have to look after my mum too

simon wants to talk
roz takes over
im going to pursue this with what do they call it
extreme prejudice to the very end
i can be enormously persistent
ask my ex girlfriend
okay well ill take your details
roz leads paul away that guys a bit full beam
yeah full beam
he opens his eyes wide to show what he means i kept thinking is he going to nut me
he appears not to be nutting me but he might well nut me
so what did karen clark want
do you think i came over as weak on the committee over there
well uh no of course not
i suppose simons phone goes again
he winces picks up
also the war committee got leaked and that leak came from your department
page i find that difficult to believe
i want action to be taken
i want a head

simon is getting into his office he and toby are back from the constituency office
we need to talk in my office
patronising i think you know
a land line is ringing in the open plan office
judy picks up
simon has gone into his office and has assumed the bollocking position
taking call sorry this is the wrong extension
ill put you through now
judy punches a button on her phone
tobys land line starts ringing
simon comes out
walking backwards into his office come come into my office
why do you need to see me
to judy whats this
page its the mad man about the wall
following her out exasperated can you come into my office so i can tell you off
toby answers his phone resigned
can i help you
malcolm sweeps in straight past toby slapping him on the back of the head as he passes
to phone no not you
malcolm pushes judy back into simons office as shes leaving it simon behind judy walks backwards to his desk the three of them in a line
malcolm shuts the door and unleashes a torrent of abuse we cant hear
wall man paul is on the phone standing with a journalist by the offending wall now badly propped up
the journalist is taking notes and photographs
what can i do for you paul
these temporary buttresses you got put up
theyre basically a pair of twigs
page im sure theyre not twigs
no theyre twigs
to journalist are you getting a picture of those twigs
that wall could fall on my mum and crush her
do you know how old she is
calling off mum how old are you
i want to tell the newspaper guy
during this conversation malcolm arrives
i want a word with the minister and charlotte fucking bronte
youre never fucking sixty
youre older than that
how old are you really
if its going in a newspaper im sixty
fuck off are you sixty
olivia newton johns fucking sixty
and shes not on the statins is she
could you tell your mum to stay away from the wall just for the time being
she needs to get to her plants
like tobys an idiot she has to water them
plants need water
no sure but could she use a hose from a distance
she doesnt have a hose shes got a watering can
this is like talking to a brick wall about a brick wall
to journalist get that down thats gold
toby can still see malcolm going ballistic at simon and judy in simons office
page karen runs out of the lifts
theres even more of a buzz than usual people running around
she sees bob adriano linton and chad in a huddle in lintons air
hurries over to liza
liza whats up
why is everyone running around
this better be a fucking fire drill
the president has said hes vetoing tarrifs on chinese auto imports
karen calls over to a staffer abbey
abbey get me the presidents statement
mr barwick has asked me to
karen is beginning to lose it
you work to me abbey you fucking work to me
get me the statement
or i will call security and have you escorted off the premises via the window
karen crosses quickly to her office
sorry why is that
what buttering the chinese up
he needs them to at least abstain in the security council
were going to the un
yes were going to the un
page karen kicks a waste paper basket
i should be told this fucking stuff
im going into lintons office and pulling the pin on his grenade
dont do that
im fucking joking
why didnt you know about this
well since i created the budget deficit the president doesnt tend to run things by me anymore
dont get funny with me
i am not in the mood
im getting that
malcolm is with simon and toby
malcolm has a local northamptonshire paper
reading while foster jets around at the taxpayers expense his constituency headquarters walls collapsing and he doesnt give a shit
it doesnt say that
holding up paper no but it says wall ace and gromitt wall ace though
page you are being portrayed as the biggest twat in northamptonshire and thats going some
it is just a wall malcolm
listen my little stem cell i dont want to be dealing with this either okay
ive got bigger fucking fish to fry believe me
im rolling blue whales in breadcrumbs at the moment
im giving this to jamie
the crossest man in scotland
jamie enters holding another local rag
well if it isnt humpty numpty
what is this surround bollocking
with respect i havent finished
if it isnt humpty numpty sitting on top of a collapsing wall like some clueless egg cunt
okay thats enough of the fucking oxbridge pleasantries
how is saying hello a
grabbing a hole puncher shut it love actually or ill hole punch your face
right im off to deal with the fate of the planet okay
simon toby and jamie look at him
page dont look at me like thats arrogant
that is just a fucking fact
dont even look at me
to jamie be gentle with them
you know me malcy kid gloves
made from real kids
an awkward beat
right butch and gaydance this wall story is playing badly
looking in his paper look heres a cartoon of you as a walrus
im not fat
i dont even have a moustache
we hired some builders
they didnt turn up when they said they would
what did you expect
have you ever seen a film where the hero is a builder
because they never turn up in the fucking nick of time
thats why you never see a superhero with a hod
simon and judy on their way into the foreign office
malcolm has gone in ahead
suzy chatting on the stairs with toby
simon draws judy to one side
this is all getting
this is a really stressful job you know that
oh come on youre not a brain surgeon youre not a snooker player
i dont want to back a war judy
page oh this is what its about oh
look drop some hints put some nods and winks out there that im toying with resignation
see if the pm reacts
see how it plays
put out some winks
no no just sort of
he does a small nod that sort of size nod
no not that much
no i was just nodding normally to say i understood the need for a small nod
they head in
in a nice room
malcolm is with michael suzy and a couple of other civil servants
so my lovely friends bottom line
i hate that phrase
were not in retailing sorry michael i promise never to use it again
page bottom line is that the president is going to the un and the pm would like us to join him
this will be the voe to commence military action
so rob innis to toby little bo cock jockey to judy and the leaky fucking mingebox return to your desks and prepare for some extreme briefing
two civil servants get up and exit
judy walks across the room and starts making calls as does toby
michael walks off into the next room suzy follows
they start calling
now then you still got doubts complicated simon
what the fuck malcolm
this is all going to spin along from here and we have a vote and we go to war
we fight people and kill them and our kids get killed and thats exactly the sort of thing i didnt want to do when i went into politics
thats the opposite of what i want to be doing
thats why youve got to stay in government
in here you can influence things delay things
out there youre just another mad shouty fucker people dont want to make eye contact with
she took a stand over health
everyone decided she was mental
only because the sun showed a photo of her with wide eyes and her head on a cow
i found that a very powerful image
a beat look the prime minister of this country is not a viking
he doesnt drink blood he doesnt go round biting tramps
he doesnt go to chequers at the weekend for a bit of light raping and a pub lunch
i know the prime minister isnt a viking malcolm
unlike me the man abhors physical violence
page hes a grade a fucking pussy and he knows you have similar concerns and he wants your input on this
wheres the intelligence
wheres the hard evidence
listen weve got evidence harder than a diamond dildo
we have intelligence so deep and hard it would fucking puncture your kidneys
theres an informant ice man ok
the stuff hes giving us
itll make your blood run cold
your insides will turn to black pudding
lowering his voice now certain box lickers are sitting on it
but youre going to see it because the pm regards you as a key player now
judys mobile goes
beat ten minutes
to simon prime minister wants to speak to you in ten minutes simon
he want you to go the malcolms heading out
see youre a list now
youre a kennedy
in the vip lounge with the gold card and the complimentary drinks and the hard on
shouting to malcolm show me the evidence malcolm thats my fucking bottom line
so do you still want
nods and winks
simon nods a little nod
then shakes his head slightly
then nods a slight nod again
suzy michael and judy are having a drink in a pub
maybe theyre sitting in a four seater booth
page their phones are on the table
as is a bottle of sancerre
judys got her power walking trainers on and her rucksack with her
heres to surviving another day
they clink glasses
my theory is malcolm built jamie in a lab out of bits of old psychopath
toby arrives dumps his coat bag puts his phone on the table
doing the joke again hello ladies
im just going to oh
i think we could have another bottle of sancerre
if you can afford it
if you can get served at the bar
he goes to the bar
his phone gets a text
suzy picks it up reads it
here we go again
whats it say
peering at the phone woah
suzy shows the phone to judy
what a twat
beat what are you doing
are you replying
page suzys texting on tobys mobile
tobys coming back
suzy puts the phone back down
yeah i wouldnt want to meet jamie in a dark alley
or a bright alley
the whole thing of just being in an alley with him would be scary regardless of the lighting
suzy cuts in
youve got a text
reading covering oh yeah
its just rob about football
you shagged her
to judy did you know my flakey boyfriend has been getting his flakey end away
i dont know anything about his flakey end
could we not talk about accusations and health issues in the pub
i should go
you havent finished your drink
i mainly have
why did you do it
i dont know it was a weird intense time over there
maybe subconsciously i dont know it was a kind of last ditch attempt to stop this awful
page a beat
michael and judy dissolve into laughter
thats definitely going in the memoirs
you had sex because of the war
in the broad sense
to judy and michael sorry can you stop doing that
can we go somewhere where theyre arent enormous children eating snacks
i should go
actually ill go
toby goes after her
a beat shall we stay
i should go
ive got a long walk ahead of me
but thatll keep me going
toby lets himself into the flat
goes through to the kitchen
suzy is there with michael
what the fuck is he doing here
what the fuck are you doing here
well i live here
no you dont actually
to michael ill go make that tea
suzy and toby go into the kitchen
beat well if im leaving im taking my brie
page and the port
and my nandos peri peri sauce
they go back out into the living room
dont forget your hydrocortisone
you putting this in your memoirs as well
i should go
no its fine
toby is in the bedroom
a few boxes are lying around
hes putting clothes into bin liners
suzy is hovering
michael brings through some teas
the atmosphere is very frosty and awkward
wheres my needlecord jacket
your geography teachers jacket
toby thinks better of responding
starts folding some shirts
michael takes over thats not how you fold
michael this is one of the more humiliating moments of my life
i can pack a bag
the key to travelling is packing
im not going to fucking fiji michael im being chucked out of my house
itll save time the other end
there is no other end
toby moves through to the kitchen to get his jeans
suzy and michael follow
page has she got big tits
you can see them on google earth
theyve got their own postcode
toby gets his jeans and some other clothes
hes laden down with boxes and bags and can hardly see
comes out into the hall
suzy is there without michael
see you then
toby struggles to open the front door
suzy opens it
toby goes to leave then stops
look suzy this is probably going to sound odd under the circumstances
its about liza
oh good tell me more tell me more about her tits
listen suze liza wrote a paper pwip pip
i think if it got leaked it could stop the war
he holds out the memory stick
i tried that with the wife
you are such a fucking coward you know that
and this is what
a make up leak
does such a thing exist
page toby take your rubbish clothes and your back issues of mojo your flute and your eighth of dope and leave me the fuck alone
toby leaves the memory stick in the flat
then heads out
simon toby and judy are on the way to heathrow
should i resign
ive floated that i might when i thought i wouldnt so itll look convincing if i did
i mean do you think is it braver to just resign and say no no war
or is it actually braver to say i dont agree but im going to grit my teeth and get on with it
is the really brave thing actually doing what you dont believe
whats brave about doing the right thing
doing the wrong thing is braver
in a way
i mean you know wars sometimes work
the war of independence that worked
for the americans
second world war
that was a good idea
i mean not a good idea but
i know what you mean
and the crimean war we got nurses out of that
nurses are good
as if theyve achieved something exactly
so youre not resigning
page no i
trying to change the subject wheres malcolm
judy simon and toby are walking past a baggage carousel
conspiratorially to toby in the motorcade
lets get a car without judy
you want hookers
you like hooky fucky
i want to talk about the resigning thing
but with you and not her
she has this air of moral righteousness that inhibits you from
saying anything morally wrong
simon and toby looking very uptight
malcolms with them
looking at phone so
the wires are all currently reporting that youre going to resign from government over the war
that wasnt supposed to get outside
yeah well it is outside
its lurking outside like a big hairy rapist at a coach station
simon looks to toby for help
do you know if i could id punch you into total paralysis
page malcolm simon toby and judy are being led through a bleak soulless basement corridor in the un by sir jonathan tutt the british ambassador to the un
hello gentlemen sir jonathan tutt
this is it
the united nations
its all a bit blurrrgh isnt it
it could do with a few more scatter cushions and a bit less asbestos
i dont know what you were expecting jacobean panelling perhaps arabesques of stonework tracery
its a shithole
it looks like a hospice for robots
they pass a big office
linton barwick is in there
karen clark is there
youre right here
sir jonathan shows them to their office
if you need anything just whistle
you know how to whistle dont you malcolm
you just put your lips together and blow
malcolm and toby look at one another
im off upstairs to the informal delegates reception
hope theres nibbles im ravenous
sir jonathan leaves
who still says nibbles
fuck the nibbles what was with the homoerotic tension
malcolm gets a call
he looks at his phone
no fucking signal down here
id be better off in an internet cafe in kircoddy
he leaves the room
jamie is on the phone running down a corridor
okay your phones off which means youve been shot dead by a fat american but theres been a fucktastrophe
someones leaked liza welds pwip pip paper to the bbc
i reckon itll be on the six oclock news here one oclock your time so its going to fist your fucking vote apart
missing you loads pwip pip toodle oo
malcolm finishing listening to his voicemail dialling and running back into the building pushing past a crowd of smokers at the doorway
okay jamie two jobs
one find the pwip pip leaker and kill them
thats one job
job one has two parts
job two stop pwip pip coming out
sow enough seeds of fear and doubt that the fat arses at the bbc dither till after the vote okay
after the vote enola gay is cleared for take off and everything is groovy
i love you
lots of delegates drinking and eating and chatting
we glimpse linton karen general miller
sir jonathan is there mingling
malcolm approaches simon toby judy and sir jonathan
page to sir jonathan do not move from this spot or ill fucking stab you
to simon was it you
but you know what im talking about
no but whatever it was i didnt do it
to toby was it you the baby from eraserhead
to judy so it must have been you woman from the crying game
it wasnt me
youve really got it in for me havent you
someones dropped a bollock in the noodles and i reckon it was you
weve done this all before
you accused me of leaking last time and it wasnt me
yeah well i know you didnt leak last time
but what i reckon is you got so pissy about being accused you leaked this time
yeah that does sound possible
look springer spaniel keep your little wet nose out alright
page im just saying psychologically speaking that sounds plausible that you might build up a resentment and then pay it off in some underhand way
thats just something ive observed
malcolms had enough goes over and grabs sir jonathan mid conversation and manhandles him away
come on baldermort i need a word
meanwhile judy and toby are left alone toby embarrassed about his comments
they look at each other sorry about that its just
mumbles something ive observed
its probably just the stress of this awful awful war
malcolm drags the ambassador into a corner
were in a new reality now and youve got to speed things up
speed up what
it needs to start at eleven oclock not one thirty
can i perhaps briefly explain the way the process works
and why that isnt possible
you see through that door there are a number of secretariats that are currently doing what we call the washing up now
just fucking do it fishlips
otherwise youll find yourself in some medieval warzone in the caucasus with your arse in the air trying to persuade a group of men in balaclavas that sustained sexual violence
is not the way forward
page no it cant be
i mean it could be done it just cant
then ill do it
motioning to a door theyre through there
yes but you cant go in that would be a serious breach of protocol
hes blocking malcolm
malcolm grabs his hand
then you do it
get in there
he is almost man handling him in
im not dancing with you malcolm
im leading look follow my lead
youre not dancing me into the secretariat
jonathan breaks off and under his own steam prepares to go in
as malcolm is leaving miller blocks his path
wheres the intel
are you sure youre working as hard as me
cos im sweating spinal fluid here
im a husk
you get everything you need
in a hurry oh yeah i think so
a beat thinks oh whoa whoa whoa just a wee moment general flintstone
was it you
did you leak pwip pip
i know you cant fire a gun but can you use a fax
no see because im upfront about what i do
i dont creep around like some fucking gay mercenary doing other peoples dirty work
page im doing my own work
im doing my job
i think youre doing lintons dirty work
i think youre his english bitch and if i walked into your hotel room tonight id find you on all fours in fishnets and him hanging out the back of
tough talk from the armchair general
what you going to do
throw a cushion at me
put your feet up on a poof and go back to sleep why dont you
listen tucker you may be some scary poodlefucker back in london but here
you know what you look like
a fucking squeezed dick
you got a blue vein running all the way up to your temple there
thats where id put the fucking bullet
but id stand well back
you look like youd be a squirter
have you ever even killed anybody
falling asleep on someone doesnt count
closer ive done my share
how many you kill pussy drip
personally i prefer maiming
go on tough guy take a swing at me
ill smack you so fucking hard youll be shitting teeth
i can see the headlines now
peace loving general starts fight in un swiss intervene
i dont know im no expert on spin but could that hurt your career
page they eyeball each other
is miller going to hit him
do excuse me
ive got work to do
oh and dont ever call me fucking english again
sir jonathan walks in
a lot of faces are turned towards him expectantly
i was wondering if i might suggest a cheeky early vote
bit of an adventure
maybe we could knock off early go for a drink
or am i
no i am
karen and miller are looking at a computer screen presumably reading about simons floated resignation
looking at computer there it is
everyones saying hes going
simon passes their open door
spotting simon simon
there he is
re internet this is great shit
i wasnt sure you had the nerve
theyre not running with that
i have not said that
youre not resigning
youre still playing the hawk
its much subtler than that
im playing a much cleverer game than that
im a whispering fake hawk
page im sorry
whispering fake hawk
youre a fake hawk
youre a fucking idiot
youre not a fake idiot are you
karen and miller go into a confab
karen and miller immediately go into a huddle and start planning simons future
to general miller as if simons not there we could just tell the press hes going anyway
say hes confirmed to us that hes resigning
i second that
do we announce it before or after the vote
then he cant do anything about it
thats decided then
no its bloody not
youre not me
i decide about all the main things about me okay
im afraid not
not on this one
this is too big for you
youre being used
we all are
the one thing we can do now to influence things is to resign
thats our only weapon
page like a suicide bomber
no not like a suicide bomber
a suicide bomber gets to make a decision
toby and liza are sitting near each other on the floor working on laptops
theyre at right angles to each other
toby has a view of liza
shes facing away from him
listen im really sorry about suzy and the texting and
do you have figures there for cfe minimum requirements
conventional forces in europe
ill just dig that out
beat taps on his laptop then very quietly look it was a very special evening for me and
pissed off sorry
i just wandered if tonight when all this shit is over we couldnt you know
im single now
youre a woman
you want to have sex again
its not a terrible idea is it
for the gipper
you know what a douchbag is toby
youre a douchbag on fucking wheels
that was short and sweet
well short and sour
simon is sitting in the meditation room a stark chapel like room with a big piece of granite in the middle of it
hes biting his nails thinking
judy comes in
im thinking of becoming a suicide bomber
thats certainly a very powerful way of getting your point across
he pulls out some mints
would you like a mint
im okay thanks
are you thinking to overdose on mints
simon eats a mint
hes lost in his own world
staring maybe slightly nodding at the thoughts in his own head
do you like me judy
youre my boss
yeah but do you actually like me
look ill leave you to your thoughts
page i havent got any thoughts
im just staring vacantly into space while a distant voice in the back of my head goes oh shit like a car alarm in the middle of the night
simon eats another mint
sits there noisily sucking it
michael and suzy are sitting talking in an fo office
jamie bursts in
was it you
i know it wasnt you youre too fucking horny for your knighthood
was it you
was what me
was it fucking you
answer the question
she cant very well answer the question if you dont tell her what it is can she
fuck off to your room count of cunty cristo this is between me and her
to suzy you leaked liza welds paper to the bbc
tell me you leaked it
i didnt leak anything
i dont know what youre talking about
you touched your nose
thats whats called a tell
you are lying
page no im not
no im not
thats a tell as well
changing tack to terror i know the leak came from here from this fucking fax machine here
he pushes a fax casually off the table onto the floor
this is what im doing to the machine
he kicks it hard till bits start to break off but hes still quite controlled talking as he kicks more you see
this is how angry i am with the piece of office equipment which leaked this document so can you imagine how angry i am with the person who did it
can you suzy
he kicks the fax machine again
it was me
oh fuck off
dont come over all spartacus now
i leaked it
advances on michael becomes aware of the music
jamie points to the cd player
okay for a start turn that fucking row off
its just fucking vowels
listen to it
just subsidised fucking foreign vowels
you only listen to that shit because its bad form to actually wear a big hat that says i went to private school
michael doesnt turn it off so jamie does
who did you leak it to
page i just sent it
i thought it was important so i sent it through
considers then ok
see this fax machine
kick thats your career
im pretty sure its fucked
let me just check kick
yeah it is
plus breach of official secrets so thats fucking swannee
maybe you can get a part time job in west end as a gentlemans fluffer
or whatever the fuck they call it these days
jamie is heading off
well you know better to go out with a bang
i will not allow this to be a bang
this will be a whimper a tiny pathetic whimper like a puppy being fucked by a big metal puppy fucking machine
and they do exist cos my grans got one
malcolm and linton enter
we see simons mints lying on the big stone in the middle of the room
so were down to the wire here mr miracle worker what have you got for me
what intel have you rustled us up
i havent got it
we need more time
you havent got it
can you delay the vote to give you time to get it
ive had the vote brought forward
simon comes in to retrieve his mints
just getting my mints
page i am telling you to delay the vote and get me some new intel
okay quick reality check j edgar fucking hoover
i dont work for you
you dont tell me what to fucking do
well firstly dont raise your voice
this is a sacred space
you may not believe that i may not believe that but by god its a useful hypocrisy
and secondarily you do work for me
your prime minister instructed you to work for me
malcolm glances at simon
get your polos and fuck off
simon stays where he is
linton starts laughing
toby enters watches in amazement
the great malcolm tucker
one of your guys has leaked a paper you cant do anything
we tell you to get intel you cant do anything
i need the vote put back you cant do anything
you sir are a useless piece of s star star t
quietly to toby what do you want
weve just heard the walls starting to collapse
a brick has fallen
thats the news im getting
more to follow
both news and bricks
linton laughs again
why dont you deal with that tucker
a wall is falling down thats more your level
i can see you with your shirt off and a wheelbarrow whistling a happy song
linton walks out
page youve been working for him
its complicated okay
ive been juggling a number of responsibilities
simon stares at malcolm
he takes a mint and pops it in his mouth
okay well right after the vote i resign
its too late now
its not worth it
the horse has bolted
its out there getting shot now
ill see you later malcolm
to toby if you repeat this to anyone i will pull your leg off break it in two and stab you to death with your broken shin bone

malcolm sits down head in his hands
the delegates are still mingling
toby is there now
tobys phone goes
into phone suzy hows it going
has jamie been round
liza comes over
this is you isnt it
indicating himself this is me yes

ive got something big lined up and you better not have fucked it up for me
into phone hello
oh hi paul

no yes i know the wall is collapsing
im as frustrated as you are mate
the vice president starts to walk by
toby sees him wants to shake his hand
look could i call you back paul
its just the vice presidents
no okay lets keep talking
the vice president has gone
michael and suzy in michaels office classical music in the background
michaels clearing his desk putting stuff in boxes
jamie bursts in on michael and suzy his phone still on
right frank and nancy sinatra
ive got good news
youre not fired
thats great news isnt it
that sounds ominous
hes fucking delighted
cancels phone we want to put liza welds pwip pip out there properly
in the public domain
we just have to refine it a bit
take out the cons change the name of the main informant
thats a complete fabrication
page changing his name doesnt make a difference
the main source in there hes not really called ice man is he
mr and mrs man youve got a son ice
so we change it to another name
whos the fuck with the fiddle
this is debussy if thats what you mean
okay well call him debussy
and then youll make a couple of other changes
itll mean your fingerprints are on it mikey but its the only way to save your job you leaky fuck
michael is now scared of what hes being asked to do
it wasnt me jamie alright
it wasnt me
dont make me do this
someone else must have come in and used the fax machine
oh that thing about your fax
dont worry about that
i made that up
the paper was sent by e mail
it s just the fax machine was there and it s easier to kick
michael looks at suzy
she doesnt know what to say or do
grabbing michael come on deuce bigalow
youre coming with me
he drags michael out of the office
on the closed door of the meditation room
malcolm suddenly bursts out re energised ready for action
hes in the middle of a call
page yeah bbc newsdesk please
hi how you doing
yeah well im hearing youre preparing a story that we might not like
one of the doors he pushes open has a coffee machine in it
toby is there getting a coffee
malcolm gestures to him to come along
toby joins malc in his jog through the corridors spilling his coffee on his hands as he goes and scalding himself
i just want to say please this garden wall story please dont run with it
beat winks at toby you getting this
simon fosters constituency office wall

malcolm walks in
he holds up his blue folder
the intelligence your guys couldnt find

its been a pleasure working with you
you know ive met some psychos in my time but none as fucking boring as you
oh sorry thats right

a boring f star star cunt
malc hands over the folder and walks out
page linton with adriano now back beside him and liza is waiting for hush from the assembled us delegation including miller
welcome aboard liza
by the way congratulations on pwip pip
i dont know
i havent read it personally
but it certainly raised your profile
that old thing
that was like a thousand years ago
to the delegation so ill keep this brief and to the point
we go in we make our case using the new british intelligence from their source debussy we win the argument we get the hell out
the delegation starts filing out
the brit delegation are gathered round a screen in a corridor showing the main debating chamber
the mood is sombre
on screen resolution is passed
judy looks at malcolm
malcolm looks straight ahead at the screen nods impassive
thats that then
thats that then
thats your quote for the ages is it
and i remember the moment war was declared
i turned to the minister and he said thats that then
anyone want a mint
piss off toby
the mood is quietly buzzy
job well done
liza is there too
we did it bob
there were moments when it was a little hairy
no there werent no
they shake hands with various colleagues
a tv shows bbc news s report on the vote
jamie is stroking michaels hair in a sweet and therefore very very scary way
michaels staring ahead pretending it isnt happening
sweetly well done michael
you did a good job
you did a really really good job
chad is there too with general miller
so i emailed my resignation ten minutes ago
to miller yours should come right after the presidents announcement to have the biggest media impact
page ive been thinking karen
this has been the hardest fucking decision of my political life
im not resigning
what the fuck george
you said that the war was intolerable and wed go together
it is it is intolerable
i still agree with myself about that
but ive got to tolerate it
my loyalty is with the kids
at the end of the day im a soldier
youre not a soldier
look at the uniform karen
im not a pastry chef
i have military commendations on my chest not a little fucking label saying my name is george
youre a politician
you live on canapes and white wine and you have three anecdotes you wheel out at every party and you scour the national papers for mentions of your name
youre a fucking politician
im still a soldier
when was the last time you shot a guy
what if i havent shot a guy in years then im not a soldier
city hall dont insist i bring along a fucking bullet ridden corpse every five years to renew my soldier licence
you know this is an unnecessary war
its a war you dont believe in
show me some balls george
i know ive got balls i dont need to show them to you
page oh sure it just so happens theyre sitting pretty in a pair of egyptian cotton ralph lauren shorts on a government salary
dont talk about my fucking balls that way
my balls have been around
my balls have got balls
come on chad lets leave the general and his over stuffed scrotum
were going to draft our resignation announcements
karen turns away from him
er i might stay with the general actually karen if thats okay
if hes staying i might stay with him and see what assistance i can furnish
general shrek and his faithful talking donkey
this takes balls karen
youve got balls sir

theyre two thirds of a snowman
get the fuck away from me
miller walks off
this was not the plan
simons on the phone to the wall man

no one could survive this
the pm is very clear on this youre sacked over the wall
you havent even spoken to the prime minister
yes i have
you fucking havent ive been right here
i have spoken to the prime minister
whether it has happened or not is irrelevant
it is true
as soon as i heard about the wall i spoke to him and he decided you had to go
im not going quietly
yeah well if you try to turn this into some anti war protest you can expect your mountain of conflict soundbite to be everywhere from ringtones to a fucking dance
mix on youtube
i will marshall all the forces of media darkness to hound you to an assisted suicide
a silence while simon and toby realise there is nowhere for him to go
right rumpleforeskins give me your laptop so shall we draft your dear prime minister just a quick note to say thanks for sacking me letter
simon doesnt know what else to do
toby goes to get his laptop
miller is having a cigarette under a no smoking sign
look i realise this is a slightly strange time to say this but i just want to say how much i admire
go fuck yoursefl frodo
lovely toby hurries off looking crushed
miller takes another drag on his cigarette
linton is going through a list with liza
general miller is sitting in on this meeting looking slightly like a man whos being shafted up the ass and having to pretend to enjoy it
okay i dont want to be accused of micro managing but i personally do not see that i heart huckabees should be on the list of dvds suitable for forces
that self indulgent crap is not suitable entertainment for combat troops
and wheres united on here
that should be playing
simon is back with roz
right ive got a selection of quotes for you theyre all local firms and none of them is very well respected
gets another piece of paper out now this sceptic tank is also rearing its pooy head again too
simon looks zonked with boredom
well alan i have been balled out by linton for allowing i heart huckabees on to the troops dvd roster
you know the phrase im too old for this shit
well im too young for this shit
page i should be out there having a youth
getting high making women pregnant
malcolm is walking through the open plan office with judy
in the background we see toby getting the last of his things together
the new minister and her advisor arrive
they are almost carbon copies of simon and toby
ah here they are
looking forward to it
war seems to be going great guns at the moment
let me take you out for an expensive lunch roast swan and all the trimmings and ill bring you up to speed on the whole middle east situation
are you twisting my arm already
aye but in a friendly non breaky way
watch your step there
theres still blood on the deck

she points at tobys desk
the minister and his advisor start making themselves at home
