screenplay by lawrence kasdan a freight truck of late s vintage pulls to the side of the road in a small rural town
a handsome well built man gets out of the passenger side and thanks the driver
the newcomer carries his coat over his shoulder and a beat up suitcase hes got a jut jaw and a modified pompadour his shirtsleeves are rolled all the way up
past his biceps
he wipes his brow against the sweltering heat and looks around
until noted below this section of the movie is in black i get outta the truck in this two bit town
i got no money and no prospects
what i need right now is a stiff drink a cold shower and a hot broad
ill take em in any order they come
old three story gothic house in ill repair beyond a peeling picket fence and a scruffy yard
the sign says rooms to rent
the newcomer goes in the gate
oh yeah one other thing i need an angle
he squints through the dirty screen door but sees nothing then knocks and turns away to survey the neighborhood
i was thinking if it werent for bad luck i wouldnt have any luck at all
can i help you
the newcomer turns toward the door
standing there holding the screen open is the landlady
shes a knockout in a cheap small town way a cotton dress that buttons down the front and clings with sweat to her generous curves
either my luck had just changed or fate just bought me another round of trouble
the newcomers pov of the landlady as she leads him up the narrow gloomy stairs from the second floor to the third story attic
she has a monroe like sway to her walk
we can barely hear her distant echoey dialogue not very fancy
house needs repairs
we havent had a man around here for so long
she kept yammerin the whole time but her hips were doing all the talking
the landlady reaches the tiny landing at the top of the stairs and opens a door to a squalid room with a bed bureau and tiny window
the newcomer has to squeeze by her voluptuous body to get inside and look around
it doesnt take long
his gaze returns to the landlady who is leaning against the door chest thrust forward
he focusses on her fingers toying with the button at her sweat shiny cleavage
it couldnt a been any clearer what the set up was
the next move was up to me
the newcomer takes a step in the landladys direction dont tell me
close up of mumford wincing
softer thats all the time we have
indicates his watch next time
we see mumfords office the office of a psychologist a therapist with a doctorate
its modest comfortable neat with a calm relaxed ambience
the movie is now in color
his patient henry follett looks nothing like the newcomer in the soft core fantasy hes been narrating
instead hes a mild looking pharmacist with glasses and a receding hairline
only the voice is the same its as studly as his fantasy alter ego
follett has been lying on a couch but now has twisted with some irritation to look at mumford
i have eighteen more minutes
i dont want to hear any more today
follett do you trust me or dont you
well i dont know
i only been seeing you without trust theres no point to any of this
you might as well not come
now hold on i didnt say i didnt want to come good then go
mumford can be seen out the big front window crossing from the two story building that houses his office on the main drag of this small town which oddly enough
is also called mumford
he comes inside and goes to the counter to pick up some take out
the proprietor is a woman around forty named lily who talks to him as she works
its not ready
my patient had to leave early
who was that
she comes over to the register with an order
mumford is am
her likes her a lot
does the phrase nosy have any meaning to you lily
i think its like
it was henry follett
reacts man you see him a lot
and its very wrong to reveal it
next youll be saying what his problem is
what do you want to know
im never telling you anything
a patron passes on the way out
hows it going
how long you been in this town
oh i dont know
four months two and a half weeks thats how long
mumford gives her a look and youve already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined
lily i dont think even you could know that lily sees something out the window
look at that guy
mumford turns to look out the window
a young man of about in jeans and a hawaiian shirt is skateboarding down the street at high speed weaving in and out amongst the cars
he zips past the front of the restaurant
you know who that is dont you
mumford does not you really dont
thats skip skipperton man
he gets himself hit by a truck this whole town shuts down
oh so thats him
the panda man
lily hands over mumfords bagged order rings it up
back on track so what makes you so popular
whats your secret
takes his bag to go you like me
let me think about it
mumford is smiling as he goes out
another patron lionel dillard a lawyer brings his check to lily watching mumford cross the street
lily cant stand this guy
thats the new psychiatrist
hes not medical
probably thinks hes pretty smart
lily gives him a look as she takes his money
an overweight teenage girl named nessa watkins is on mumfords couch
she fidgets as she talks and cant decide whether to lie down so shes looking away from him or sit up and face him
she plays with an unlit cigarette and keeps taking out a lighter then stuffing it back in her big sloppy handbag
so he already had the tattoo that said naomi forever
and now theyre broken up see and he has to have it removed
but while the scar is still healing or whatever you call it when you have a tattoo removed he meets chandra
and its serious immediate love
so in no time hes gone from the most gorgeous model in the world to the most gorgeous actress in north america
what do you mean in no time
in maybe three or four issues
weekly or monthly
god how shallow do you think brad is
why do i waste my time telling you this stuff
why do you think you tell me nessa
dont do that thing
that shrink thing
its a big part of the show
she jams the cigarette in her mouth and flames the lighter but is afraid to actually break his rules
you really need to let people smoke in here you know
what are they paying you to see me
mumford indicates nothing
the school board doesnt pay you
what kind of deal is that
its called pro bono
he waits her out pro bono huh
for whose good supposedly
its my bit for the community
fuck the community
he wont go for it there was this article my friends and i read
it was signs hes great in bed
it was very fascinating
where was this
the new york times
the first one was he handles produce well
which we already knew
an expression she uses the point is you have a lot of the signs
you been spying on me in the supermarket nessa
have women found you attractive
i knew you wouldnt answer
ive been thinking about what you said last time
how me trying to lose weight and constantly not is like a lot of people with addictions
how maybe i cant lose the weight ever
quietly which we already knew
thats not quite what i said its a really weird thing for a shrink to say
and then you said maybe peopled be happier if theyd accept that some things dont change that itd be some kind of a relief or something
well i guess im just a dumb bitch but how depressing is that moment the moment when you give up
the last rays of sun are fighting their way through the trees as mumford comes up the trail he clearly knows very well
mumford climbs out on the big rock settles himself on the edge and takes a long drink from a water bottle
what he sees far below at the foot of these hills lights just twinkling on is the town of mumford
he stares at it for several long moments
then he takes a small headlamp from his pack and fits the straps over his head it looks like a miners light
he twists the light on to test it and turns his head to watch the beam move about
we cut back wide
after a beat mumford settles back and turns off the light
the place is quietly busy with the regulars
mumford has a favorite spot at the far end of the bar
right now hes sitting alone reading the remnants of a newspaper
skip skipperton the man on the skateboard comes in
everyone in the bar is surprised to see skip in here
several patrons greet him as he makes his way deeper inside looking around
he seems relieved when he spots mumford and heads back there
mumford doesnt notice skip waiting for his attention
mumford looks up smiles
skip offers his hand
youre doc mumford
mumford nods skip skipperton
how are you
ive been hoping wed meet
ive heard a lot about you
mumford waits friendly
skip runs out of gas gets uneasy glances around
do you think we could
can i buy you a drink
in a booth near the back
theyve been at it a while but nothing is clear to mumford yet
skip keeps his voice down he doesnt want anyone else in the bar to hear him
find the need and fill it my dad used to say i guess a lot of dads say that but i did and it just took off
whered that come from
ive always liked giant pandas
ive been to china and seen them in the wild
thats the kind of thing i can do if i want
i can do pretty much anything i want to do these days
skip stares into his beer for a moment as though the thought depresses him
he catches himself and snaps back so now we make of the modems in the market which is pretty good
skip glances around leans in confidential
when i was growing up here the town was about dead
the timber business was played out
panda changed all that
now just about everybody in town either works for the company or depends on it somehow
which is kinda the problem
mumford waits watches
skip gets uncomfortable
would you like another beer
brightens like a kid far out
gets up can i pick it
skip heads off to the bar
mumford looks around
everybody is watching
the bar crowd has thinned
both mumford and skip have had a few
in fact mumford is now carefully pouring them each another drink from a bottle of glensomething on the table
you want me
mumford leans forward in the same confidential way skip did before he indicates that skip should lean in too
mumford is almost whispering but thats not whats really going on
skip is excited whats really going on is
you have some problems and you want some therapy but you feel it could be very bad for panda modem stock if word got out that you were having head
skip confirms thats it
can i ask you a personal question
thats exactly what i want
have you thought about getting a wife
skip makes a face and gesture to indicate a large yes
but also total frustration and failure
when panda started to happen i was dating women from new york san francisco l
they came out of the woodwork
models actresses venture capitalists
these were not the kind of girls who were interested in me before i hit it
and you know what i discovered
i discovered these girls did not love me for myself
the majority of them didnt even like me
but a lot of them wouldve gladly become mrs
skipperton for a while
can you imagine that marrying someone just because theyve got money
mumford considers that
i gotta pee
he gets up a little wobbly can i ask you something
this town is called mumford
been that way since
finally remembers thirteen
mumford if you say so now heres the question your name is mumford too
is that the question
you moved here from back east and your name is the same as this town
is that right
mumford shrugs far out
skip takes a few steps toward the mens room then comes back and leans down toward mumford
i hope you dont think i want you to do this for free
just because were gonna play it like were friends doesnt mean i wont pay you like a doctor
i have a lot of money
do you know how much money ive got
dont tell me cause im not going to tell you what ive got
ive got three big ones
i couldnt make three million dollars if i lived three lifetimes
i have three billion dollars
skip stumbles off to take a leak
mumford takes a moment to digest that
mumford is listening to lionel the arrogant lawyer who asked about him in the restaurant
lionel is lying on the couch talking with enormous energy he has a serious superiority complex
mumford cant stand him and the session seems to be lasting an eternity
so im watching brokaw and theyve got some astronomer this little limey know it all and hes telling how with this himball telescope theyve discovered there are maybe million more
galaxies than they thought there were
and i guess thats supposed to make me feel small
im supposed to feel insignificant
is that the point
because i can tell you it didnt
mumfords eyes dart to look at the clock on the bookshelf lionel since this is our first session together maybe lionel is twisting his neck around painfully to look back
you can sit up and look at me if youd like lionel waves that off and looks away maybe it would be helpful if you told me a little about
what brought you here
kind of impatient for a big time headshrinker arent you
how bout you let me explain it my own way
as lionel goes on mumfords eyes again dart toward the clock still
hold on it
finally it moves
mumfords eyes dart toward his desk a deadly looking letter opener in the shape of excalibur stands glinting light in a marble rendition of arthurs stone
and in the dream its always the same i wake up in my room from when i was i kid in ohio and i realize this is the day of
the big exam at school
mumfords head rocks slowly back for a moment as if hes going to drift off
he snaps back to life and stares hard at the top of lionels head where there is a bald spot starting to take hold
the sound of lionels voice begins to echo which is no problem for me because i remembered it was coming and ive attended every class so im totally prepared
then i see myself running down the hall at school
mumfords glance flashpans from lionels bald spot to the gleaming letter opener
mumford closes his eyes
we cut to a boy unmistakably the young lionel runs down the deserted hallway toward a bright doorway
lionels dream has a blue but its not really my school and this is very interesting its the school from the next district go on
young lionel comes breathlessly in the classroom door and stares alarmed
and even though i arrive a little bit early everybodys already there
but the surprising part is what young lionel sees everyone in the class including the teacher in the front is naked
the teacher holds out an exam toward young lionel
im the only one whos prepared
althea brockett a woman in her forties sits on the couch reading a mail order catalogue for home furnishings
there are several other catalogues sticking out of her jammed woven carry all
the door to mumfords inner office opens with some force
mumford stands looking back across his office at lionel who is getting up from the couch in some confusion
you cant do this
sure i can lionel
im a criminal lawyer you think i like my clients
i cant stand most of them
but i dont kick them out
see that sign we retain the right to refuse service to anyone
im not going to charge you for this session but i dont want to see you back here
lionel looks around but there is no such sign
he does spot althea watching the show from the couch
dont you at least have a back door i can use
come out this way
theres no shame in getting a little therapy
is there althea
althea stands up smiling
she thinks mumford is the bees knees
not at all
it takes guts lionel
lionel steams by them in a black mood
maybe some of us dont need this crap
and its the hubble telescope not the himball telescope
lionel bangs out the front door
mumford motions althea inside jeez
what an asshole
althea heads inside giggling wildly
she cant get enough of this guy
althea is sobbing
mumford hands her a new kleenex from the box next to the couch
she wads it with her current one and tries to stop crying
mumford settles back in his chair patient
what do they want from me
more sobbing what have i done thats so wrong
pulling it together they act as though they dont have their own peculiar things
everybodys got something
looks at mumford even you probably have things
me more than most
why are they ganging up against me
im not sure
but i think theyre worried about you
its the kids you know not jeremy
he had nothing to do with this except pay of course
hes always willing to pay
hes extremely generous
a long beat im so humiliated that my own children would threaten me
how did they threaten you
they said if i didnt get help they wouldnt deal with me any more
a beseeching look what do you think about that
althea stares at him a long moment
she knows hes right
tears well up in her eyes and roll down her cheeks
she grabs another kleenex
in the midst of the torrent she tries to talk but its undecipherable mmmmfffstttubll abbittmm
althea uses three new tissues to dry up her face
you must come out to the house for dinner on thursday
you think so
jeremy will be home for the weekend
and you can meet the kids
mumford considers then nods his assent
mumford hurries up the sidewalk carrying two grocery bags
the modest houses are close together on this pretty street which rises out of the main business district seen beyond mumford
mumford comes to the house where he lives
he heads down the driveway toward the stairs that lead up to his apartment
the front yard is completely fenced
lily the owner of the restaurant is almost visible in there working among the greenery of a lush garden
her friendly dog ainge sees mumford leaps easily over the fence and does a circle around mumford who has no free hand to pet him
how ya doin ainge
doesnt look up ainge
the dog leaps gracefully back into the yard
mumford hurries up the stairs
mumford comes in and puts the bags down on the kitchen counter
he goes directly to the table by his main chair and picks up the tv remote
he switches it on and changes the channel
the opening segment of unsolved mysteries is just beginning
it previews the stories on that evenings episode disappearances and unclosed cases with robert stack hosting
close on mumfords face as he watches
only when the whole show has been previewed does he seem to relax
he leaves the show on as he goes into the kitchen and begins unloading the bags
mumford is comparing different stepladders
cook the sixty ish proprietor has been watching from a distance but now dr
doesnt really know him mr
could you come with me please
mystified mumford follows cook through the door into the back
back of the store
cook motions for mumford to take the seat of honor in the work area but mumford prefers to stand
cook has a little trouble figuring how to start
finally i know i shoulda come to your office
i was gonna actually but then when you walked in here today
its my daughter sofie
shes gotta problem
were not sure
shes been to all kinds of doctors in the city and theyve said different things
some of em are callin it wants to get this right epstein barr virus and the rest are callin it
chronic fatigue symptom
chronic fatigue syndrome
thats it syndrome
so you know all about it
theres a lot of debate about it
yeah i got that
some people think its all in their heads
more intense its been so bad shes had to move back here to mumford and live with us
and im not sure thats the best thing either
a lot of things
several different factors
will you see her doctor mumford
why dont you bring her up to my office at tomorrow afternoon
cook nods but looks worried
im not sure shell come
shes in a mood
do you ever go to somebodys house
generally that doesnt work out so well
it sends the wrong message to people who need to make a change
cook is quick to agree he doesnt want to make waves
but hes worried
mumford is walking up the busy sidewalk carrying his new foot stepladder hooked on his shoulder
folks greet him
suddenly lionel appears in front of mumford who stops
youve got to have the right ladder for the job
you dont know what youre doing you can get yourself in trouble
youre right as usual
mumford continues up the street
we stay with lionel who watches mumford with a sour look then turns to enter a small medical building
ernest delbanco a middle aged psychiatrist with longish vanity hair and phyllis sheeler a psychologist in her thirties sit on the doctors comfortable furniture listening
the remains of their take out lunch is on the coffee table
they seem a little impatient with their as yet unseen visitor completely inappropriate and highly unprofessional
now i dont want to presume to tell you how to run your businesses practices
lionel is sitting across the room making an ardent case whatever
six months ago you two were the only games in town
the value of your
mocking practices could be seriously undermined by this bozo
a town this size has only so many headcases to go around
what exactly would you have us do lionel
protect your turf
check this guy out
i smell a rat i tell you
delbanco and sheeler exchange a look they find lionel distasteful
dillard im sure dr
delbanco shares my gratitude for your concern
but i also know hed agree that you misunderstand the nature of our calling to mental health
were not in some
widget business trying to crush our competition
what the hells a widget
lionel comes out of the office miffed and goes down the stairs
a moment later the door opens slightly and delbanco peeks out to make sure lionel is gone
he closes the door on us
delbanco stands at the door looking across the room at sheeler
what an asshole
agrees ernest what do you think
i think hes got a point
so does she
the beautifully manicured field is surrounded by lush woods
standing about forty feet apart mumford and skip are alone on the field throwing a baseball back and forth
for quite a while the only sounds are the birds the wind and the regular slap of ball into glove
finally this is great
this is exactly what i wanted
skip you must have lots of people you can throw a ball with
youd be surprised
most guys have kids or wives or girlfriends
its not as easy as you think
skip youre the head of the whole deal here
are they busier than you
well you know
thats the thing
like i said just about everybody in town works for me
and its just not the same asking someone to throw a ball when they work for you
its like an order or something
and no one no one asks me
so would you say were out here
let me think how to put this
is your problem really that youre
dont you like this
hell yes i like it
whats better than this
most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like
have you got a lot of friends
nope lily and i talk a bit
you know lily runs the coffee shop
ive seen her
good looking woman
agrees shes probably ten years older than you
good looking woman
lives downstairs from me
shes got a great dog named for danny ainge
sparks to that really
im the only person i know that likes danny ainge outside of celtic fans
well theres lily
did you know that danny ainge was drafted by the blue jays
do you know what kind of athlete you have to be to play in the nba and in the bigs
and lily named her dog after him
what kind of person do you have to be to do this
mumford gestures off in the one direction we have not yet seen
this reverse angle the baseball diamond is sitting in the vast lush grounds behind the panda modem world headquarters a brand new distinctively original high tech office park
wherever there is an opportunity for tasteful signage it is in the motif of a giant panda sweet white face black eyes and ears round body
skip is suddenly self conscious embarrassed
i wouldve traded any of it to have made the mumford high varsity
mumford takes that in
so i guess henry follett is a patient of yours
hes my pharmacist
guys got some serious sex fantasies
skip is a little surprised to hear this from mumford but he just throws the ball
pretty good too
lots of detail
nothing hard core
old fashioned ones from back when people cared about atmosphere and character
problem is his fantasy lifes a lot better than his real one
nothing can live up to it
his wife got sick of it and left him
took his kids with her
i wondered what happened to her
skip is fascinated but a little uncomfortable
mumford seems oblivious unusually talkative of course its not that simple
theres something powerful going on there
weve got a lot of work to do
announcer voice its hit to the warning track
for the first time mumford throws the ball way high like a long fly ball
skip delighted as a dog takes off running and just barely catches it on the run
he pegs it back to mumford
in these fantasies henry follett is played by a handsome guy with biceps
can you imagine that
where your self esteem has to be
throws him the ball man id just like to move the guy to the point where he gets to appear in his own fantasies
nessa sits staring at mumford defiantly an unlit cigarette in her mouth
mumford looks at the clock and stands up session over
nessa quickly lights her cigarette with the lighter concealed in her hand and stands up too
she exhales a huge cloud of smoke and walks quickly to the back door of the office which mumford has opened for her and goes out
mumford waves half heartedly at the cloud of smoke as he walks to the door to the waiting room and opens it
mumfords pov as the door swings open the first figure we see is mr
cook he twists around at the sound of the door
he acknowledges mumford and then sighs as he steps aside to reveal sitting exhausted in a chair his daughter sofie a young woman whose actual appearance is somewhat disguised at
present by her wan ashen visage
she regards mumford with some resignation
her father helps her out of the chair
sofie keeps her eyes on mumford
close on mumford watching her
cook is gone
sofie is sitting up on the couch facing mumford
she looks like she might pass out at any moment but her voice is stronger than youd expect
feel free to lie down
most people do
id better not ill fall right to sleep
i think its too soon for me to be sleeping with you
what can you tell me about this
its almost too exhausting to tell you
tiny smile to herself about my exhaustion
i didnt really want to come
im not hopeful right now
but i couldnt take the look on my dads face
hes a truly kind person which is pretty extraordinary if you knew the story
hes the opposite of me i guess all stamina and resolve
its taken all her energy to say this and she sinks down a bit into the couch
when did you start to feel this way
about six months ago i guess it is now
god it seems like years
what a bore
im embarrassed by it
before this happened when id hear people talk about this kind of thing i thought it was a bunch of bullshit
she sees something in his face and suddenly laughs its a weak but magical sound
you think that now
you think its a bunch of hooey dont you
i saw it
i saw it in your eyes
mumford is knocked off balance shes right
she saw him clearly
maybe it is
my mother always says everything thats wrong with you is in your head
i suppose thats true
back when this started was there anything unusual happening in your life
a change of job of living situation
a loss of some kind
but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final
thats not too suspicious is it
but it wasnt like i was feeling bad about the divorce
just the opposite
is that a professional opinion
hmm as in thats interesting
sometimes with enough clues its possible to figure these things out
even if you dont think its real
i dont know whats real and what isnt
thats never been my strong suit
but if youre tired all the time and youve had to give up the life you were having and come back home when you didnt want to
thats worth trying to fix
maybe i can help you do that
what would you do
we would try several things
but i need to see you a lot
i dont know
i barely made it today
ill come to you
well try a little walking
sofie suddenly looks defeated
well take it slow
youll never feel you cant handle it
i dont think i can afford it
i dont want my dad paying
well work it out
sofie gives him a long look
you have the best answer for everything
mumford shrugs you seem so
are you always this sunny
no one ever thought so
you must bring it out
is it contagious
cause everyone agrees my immune systems way down
maybe youll catch it
can i ask you something
mumford of course didnt you tell my dad you didnt think it was a good idea to come to the patient
he admits it so what changed
mumford just smiles
he doesnt want to tell her the truth everything
a taxi drops mumford in front of the brocketts large and beautiful house which sits on an isolated lot on the outskirts of town
althea leads mumford toward the back of the lavishly appointed house
the weird thing what gets in the way of the decor is the cardboard boxes of all sizes which are stacked everywhere
many are unopened but the rest are spilling their styrofoam nugget and bubble wrap guts to reveal some hint of their contents a huge variety of catalogue ordered housewares clothing
linens gadgets and knickknacks
if it can be ordered from an upscale catalogue and everything can it is here
althea sounds very nervous cheery
sorry everythings in such an uproar
lots of big occasions coming up and of course christmas is only eight months away giggles uncontrollably i dont know whats keeping jeremy
you know he stays in the city three nights a week i guess i explained that
mumford nods i know katies here but im not so sure about martin
im making dinner myself tonight so ill have to leave you im afraid
they come out onto the wide porch which commands a spectacular view of the surrounding countryside
theres an elaborate bar cart out here which althea points mumford toward
im awful i know but will you please help yourself
i just got a new copper sauciere from williams sonoma and im afraid itll be the death of us all if i dont get back in there
she disappears inside with a bang of the screen door
mumford gets a drink for himself taking in the view
he sees something out there
mumfords pov way in the distance coming out of the woods and down toward the house is a teenage boy
youre the doctor arent you
mumford turns to see that altheas thirteen year old daughter katie has silently appeared
her jeans and little tee shirt are meant to be sexy it seems sad on her
you must be katie
people call me doc
motioning urgently cmere
mumford follows as she disappears around the corner of the porch
mumford follows katie into a gloomy hall from a side entrance
here too the walls are lined with boxes
she tiptoes to one of two facing doors and waits for him
when he has joined her she motions him back a foot for safety then carefully opens the door to a large walk in closet
katies caution becomes understandable the space is packed so fully and chaotically with catalogue item cartons that it might come tumbling out the door with one careless move
katie closes the door then pirouettes to the opposing door which she swings open freely revealing what was once a study is now completely filled with hundreds of cartons in
an infinite variety of shapes and sizes
mumford is taken aback
katie points at packages and speaks in a hypnotic whisper cuddledown
museum of modern art
just as mumford and katie come back around the corner martin altheas sixteen year old son crosses the yard and comes up onto the porch
hes wearing an old black leather jacket with a lot of zippers dirty jeans and black converse all stars that are coming apart
in his hand casually but properly held is a
he looks mumford over
is this him
nods i showed him
to mumford do you get it now
this is no joke
mumford takes them both in and nods
suddenly their manner changes for the worse
what they can see that mumford cannot is jeremy brockett altheas husband who has come to the back screen door with the bustle of a late arrival
seeing mumford jeremy steps out onto the porch to shake his hand
jeremy is quite handsome and a fantastic dresser his armani outfit cost all in
his tone hearty and strained you must be dr
mumford of mumford
nice to meet you
sorry im late
traffic was a motherfucker
have another drink ill be back in five
jeremy goes inside
martin and katie exchange a look with each other then to mumford
martin goes inside
dinner is over
jeremy comes out onto the veranda carrying two cuban cigars
his casual outfit is as stylish and pricey as his work outfit
he joins mumford and althea who immediately gets up
ill be back
she goes inside
the men each have a snifter of cognac
jeremy makes a ceremony of cutting the cigars i think youll like this
know much about cuban cigars
jeremy puts the cigars down pulls a joint out of his cashmere pullover and fires it up
after exhaling a huge cloud of smoke he offers the joint to mumford who declines
makes the whole thing that much better
jeremy takes another hit on the joint and puts it down
he gives a cigar and his gold lighter to mumford who begins to light up just hold the flame a little bit below the end
now just turn it slowly as you draw
mumford does as hes told
jeremy lights his own cigar
are you a man who likes to treat himself right
ive had my moments
and im not ashamed of it
nobody ever said on their death bed i treated myself too well
i thought it was nobody ever said i should have spent more time at the office
fill in the blank
i dont mind the office
the point is you only go round once
like the zens say be here now
what do you do
althea hasnt told you
no weve been talking about her mostly
well in four of us left our firms and formed an investment banking venture
weve got twenty three people working there now
youve done well
the marijuana is kicking in now jeremy gets a self satisfied condescending look on his face that no straight mind would dare
his response includes their lavish immediate surroundings weve done
you know anything about addiction doc
well im addicted to winning
i say when youre in the red zone you gotta score
watches mumford smoke so what do you think
i mean about althea
makes a face behavior
do you think you can fix her up
what do you thinks wrong with her
shes gone weird is whats wrong with her
out of control
probably from living out here in mayberry
jeremy blows cigar smoke into his snifter then takes a mouthful of cognac savoring the sensations
mumford watches fascinated by this guy
youre the doctor what do you think
she seems very unhappy
jeremy gives him a look as if to say duh
i think we all knew that professor
the real drawn out stoned quest tio nee
mumford looks at him a long time
jeremy brocketts mercedes sl whips around a curve
martin is driving mumford back to town
but you know how to drive
got a license
yes but no car
dont need it
i just got my license two weeks ago
i been drivin since i was twelve
that would explain it
can you help mom
intense got to
they drive in silence for a bit
then nessa watkins
she comes to you doesnt she
youre treating her right
mumford gives him a surprised look then acknowledges it
whats wrong with her
is she a friend of yours
man she could be cool but all she does is get wrecked and do all the guys
shes blowin them in the parking lot
mumford knew that
a persons got to hate themselves to act like that
mumford regards martin with respect then turns to look out front
after a few moments have you ever met a bigger shithead than my stepfather
lily is walking ainge as the mercedes pulls up and mumford gets out
ainge runs happily around the car and puts his paws up on the drivers door to greet martin we hear the clicking scratch of his nails on the surface
martin rubs the dogs head
jeremy wont mind
the dog obediently leaves martin and runs back to lily
mumford waves as martin pulls away
to ainge do we run into the street
no i didnt think so
looks after martin nice car
hows that place
its a pretty piece of land
they walk up the block with the dog
and the brocketts
whatd you do tonight
it was insane here man
hadda call in the national guard
he nods then i did my laundry
did you know the government is wasteful
mumford reacts you heard it here first
oh and being a supermodel
its no walk in the park
why do you watch
no gentleman caller doc
they turn back not that i care
ive had it with men
theyre so fascinated by their own crap
took me four years to get the last one out
almost turned me into a dyke
these days my idea of a hot date is a long shower by myself before bed
now that feels good
and you dont have to do all that
i guess thats the story of your life
tight on computer screen
a health information library website has been called up on mumfords office computer
right now its beginning to spew information about chronic fatigue syndrome definitions signs and symptoms diagnostic measures etc
mumford is hunched over the computer reading avidly
his printer is churning out hard copies
mumford comes out the front door and holds it open for sofie
he offers his arm and she takes it tentatively
im not making any promises
well turn back anytime you want
seeing something oh boy
this should be interesting
mumford looks out toward the street
a woman in her fifties is turning into the front walk
she stares at them unsmiling as the two parties converge
she is mrs
i want you to meet dr
like the town
offering his hand yes
its nice to meet you mrs
she finally takes his hand but its not friendly
whats happening here
were going for a walk
do you think thats a good idea
mumford does yes
ive put myself completely in his hands
for today anyway
what kind of doctor are you
not a real doctor
thats right the fake kind
cook is not amused
sofie pulls on mumford
wed better go or im liable to bail on the whole thing
cook steps aside as they move up the walk
mumford and sofie foreground walk slowly up the block
in the background mrs
cook watches for awhile before going inside
moms such a cutie
people usually have to get to know me before they hate me
shes not in a bad mood
shes like that all the time
a beat it doesnt bother me anymore
its my dad and my brother i worry about
but youre the one whose ass is dragging
laughs is that the technical description of what ive got
is she against you getting help
we dont discuss it
somethings bothering her
oh weve all disappointed her
me especially but dad of course
she thinks my brothers all right but she didnt expect much
its what happens when you marry beneath yourself
sofie suddenly seems to be fading
negative thinking makes everything more difficult
if youre going to have enough strength to do this we have to talk only about positive things
she looks at him unsure if hes serious
it seems so corny
but she agrees
are you positive your mothers a bitch
she laughs surprised just kidding
youve got a funny idea of funny
seems worried ive offended you
what would it take
she laughs again surprised again
hes got her off balance makes a rim shot sound
is this the treatment
cause ill tell you none of the others have tried this approach
theyve come to the corner
he gestures to ask shall we cross
she considers for quite a while gauging her strength then still on his arm steps off the curb absurdly unconvincing hey just do it
they cross out of frame as we hear i want you to tell me all your symptoms
theyre dressed differently
sofie seems more vigorous
the list is so long
im tired all the time obviously
i always feel like taking a nap
but when i try to sleep i have trouble
mumford nods my muscles ache
and my joints
i feel like an old person or like i did back when i used to work out too hard
close on computer screen
under the list of signs and symptoms sore throat
on the screen low grade fever
painful lymph glands
low grade fever
painful lymph glands
yes forget fulness
yes yes and definitely yes
i get confused
yeah most people have that
its confusing here
mumford is leading sofie through the lightest set of calisthenics ever devised
now theyre doing waist bends and arm waving
even so its taking everything sofies got
i dont know if i mentioned the headaches
did you get headaches before this
sofie yes but you get more now
or more severe
no not really
theyre about the same
my marriage was one long headache
so the headaches may not even be a part of this
she considers that reluctantly agrees
i can give myself a headache instantly
is that like a party trick
all i have to do is have two conflicting thoughts at the same time
like ill think taking these walks is going to help sofie get better
but then ill also think mumford you just enjoy taking these walks and youre kidding yourself about the benefits
sofies not sure how to take that
she looks away
ive given myself a real whopper
you actually address yourself by name in your thoughts
mumford laughs so you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage
pulling in two different directions at once
it makes tiny little tears in our fabric
well then my life has been some kind of huge rip
the handsome newcomer of folletts fantasy comes down the steps from the attic wearing a sleeveless undershirt towel thrown over his shoulder
he goes into the bathroom off the second floor hall and begins to wash up
again folletts fantasy world is in black white
the town was a rubes heaven but i found work my first day out down at old man sutters gas station and diner
i knew his stacked young wife was going to be a problem but hey life is full of problems
back at the boarding house i was washing up when i heard a load of yellin and in the bathroom mirror the newcomers pov a nubile teenager going on in
a tight cheerleaders outfit comes up the stairs and stops at the top to turn and yell back down at her mother
her dialogue distant and echoey get off my case
you dont like any of my friends
i got my first look at the landladys daughter
the landladys daughter looks up and sees the newcomer watching her through the half open bathroom door
she gives him a petulant white hot look then turns on her heel and goes into her room at that end of the hall
she bangs her door behind her but it bounces open again about a foot
the newcomer still watching in the bathroom mirror now has a view of the bureau mirror in the landladys daughters room
in there seemingly oblivious the girl quickly strips off the top of her outfit revealing a s era white bra
lucky for me she was plenty upset but not too careful
suddenly in mirror reflection of mirror the landladys daughter meets the newcomers smoldering stare and her lip begins to curl
or maybe it wasnt an accident at all mr
cause in that instant i saw the beginning of a vixens smile and i knew henry
mysteriously the door to the girls bedroom slams shut cutting off the newcomers view
he looks with surprise into his mirror it suddenly shatters
follett sits up abruptly on the couch and twists toward mumford agitated
im paying for this
not for this
not me youre not
challenging you find it distasteful dont you
it doesnt matter how i feel about it
its how you feel about it that matters
i enjoy it
does that make me some kind of pervert
just because a man has a rich imaginative life you didnt come to me because you have a rich imagination
you came because its taking over
youre in its grip
i never said that
mumfords tone suddenly picks up a touch of steel
wheres your wife henry
follett flinches settles back down onto the couch sulking
wheres your wife henry
go to hell
softer i didnt hear you
follett mutters something to himself then is silent until we got divorced
petulant i had to get rid of her
she couldnt satisfy me
shouts follett jumps what
follett seems to shrink in size
theyve been here before and he doesnt like it
softly i was
normal again now were back on track
again follett says something under his breath
long beat you are so mean
mumford strides up the trail on his late day excursion
he comes around a bend and is surprised to find skip waiting for him looking serious
i know were not supposed to get together till wednesday
thats all right
whats on your mind
mumford indicates that skip should walk with him up the trail
how many sessions have we had now doc
mumford tries to remember six
and its been good
like we were two buddies hanging out
just shootin the shit
they walk in silence for a while
this is really hard
everything i want to say is hard
mumford and skip come out of the trees climb onto the big rock and settle down
the sun is falling over the town of mumford
were like friends almost
who trust each other
he checks mumfords reaction
mumford nods offers skip water who turns it down
mumford takes a swig
i want to tell you something doc but before i do i need to ask you a question
because for me to tell you this thing well i havent told anybody about this
its the biggest secret ive got
sometimes its best to keep a few things just for ourselves
youre a shrink doc
arent i supposed to be able to tell you everything
its just a thought
skip even more unsure now looks away at the town below
that really relates to the thing i want to ask you
ive noticed that sometimes not a lot but sometimes when were hanging out throwin the ball
or that time we went bowling
sometimes youll like gets it out fast tell me things about your other patients
mumford lets that hang a few moments then acknowledges it silently
now skip is even more nervous
hey maybe thats all right
i dont know all that much about psychology or therapy or
ethics so maybe theres something i missed
youre concerned that maybe i cant be trusted with a secret
i trust you
but yeah im a little concerned
i mean youre not supposed to tell anyone about your patients problems
mumford looks at skip for a long moment
that is correct skip
im going to have to take a long look at that
the conversation seems to end there
skips not sure where to go next
finally yeah well
what i was gonna tell you skip
knowing what you do about me doc i trust you
youve listened to me better than anybody
leans in intense and this secret ive got i cant stand it anymore
i dont know if im some kind of skip looks around at the darkening woods though clearly theres no one around
i dont know if im a pervert or what
its taken me this long to get where i can come out and say it
i cant back away now
i cant spend another day not knowing if im nuts
skip closes his eyes for a second and gathers himself
all right im just gonna tell you as simple and direct as i can
one last spasm of doubt and you understand that this is a big secret
just between us
mumford does okay
you know ive got this gift for certain kinds of
you are panda monarch of modems
and you also know that even though i make of the modems in the world
i cannot make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me
lets say that for now
its true believe me
do you know what ive been doing all alone in my workshop for almost two years
find the need and fill it
how i spend my every solitary hour
mumford shakes his head no
mumford demurs go ahead guess
if he must jerking off
although thats a good guess
no what ive been working on what the world really needs and no one has been able to create leans in whispering a virtually life like humanoid gender specific anatomically
sexual surrogate slash companion
mumford tries to put that all together
finally slash what
no doc not a doll
i am panda
im talking about much much more than a doll
the world has never seen what im talking about
except maybe in the movies
mumford considers that a long time watching as the sun finally sinks below the horizon
he looks back at skip
hows it coming
you dont think im insane
no and thats your secret
skip yes you meant like a trade secret
no doc a private secret
its perverted its pitiful
what am i dr
arent you repulsed
sounds like kind of a good idea
its getting dark fast now
mumford reaches into his bag and takes out the headlamp we saw earlier
he fits the straps carefully over his head
skip thats not much of a secret
hurt its not
oh its okay
its just not something to be ashamed of
maybe you dont want people knowing and believe me its safe with me but on the scale of dirty little secrets id give it say
mumford twists the headlamp and the light shines out in the dusk
mumford turns the beam directly at skip
you want to know a secret
ill tell you a secret
since its just between us and all
skip hanging on every word now agrees emphatically
the secret skip is this i am not now nor have i ever been
at first skip thinks hes misunderstood mumford
but in the huge silence that ensues he replays it and knows hes heard right
mumford looks around adjusts his headlamp and gets up
wed better get going
just follow my light
and skip watch your step
this porch is directly above lilys porch
mumford and skip sit nursing beers
theres a cooler on the floor
mumfords legs are propped up on the porch railing who else knows
its time you did some talkin dr
mum wait a minute
that is your name isnt it
mumford takes a drink of beer
what is your name
you can call me doc
it matters to me
mumford gestures sorry no can do
ive told you a lot of private stuff
i can tell you anything else
what about everything
how did this happen
mumford looks at skip considering
he takes a long pull from his beer then looks at the frosty bottle
did you know that every species of mammal has found some way to drug inebriate or anestnetize itself
even if its just banging its head against a rock
seems to be some natural urge
to get away for a while
one more look at skip ive had it for as long as i can remember
the first place i wanted out of was home
as mumford talks we see images from his past all from mumfords pov
we do not see him in the scenes
instead everyone else in the scene relates to the camera as mumford even if theyre just ignoring him
moving fast mumfords childhood pov toward the back door of a rundown little house in a poor mining community
we reach the back door and bang inside the cramped interior is grimy and depressing
mumfords mother worse for wear has just put a glass of liquor on the sink and returned her attention to the smoking stovetop
she glances briefly at mumford and greets him pleasantly clearly drunk
suddenly her attention shifts and we pan to the front door which is opened roughly by mumfords father a coal miner whose face still shows the grime of his work
but its his scary scowl that impresses
his eyes take in his wife and her drink but he says nothing
he barely gives mumford a glance as he drops his lunch pail on the table and disappears into another room
i thought i had the best parents in bald knob west virginia
till i was seven years old and got a look at some others
they werent bad folks
at the dinner table
across the table mumfords older sister eats with her head down
on the right mumfords mother is picking at her food
mumfords pov shifts to his father who is yelling something at his wife
but they were real unhappy about being who they were
now his father looks suddenly at mumford his hand shoots out to slap mumfords face and the image goes black then immediately fades up again on tight on a test
paper being laid on an old fashioned student desk
scrawled in red pencil at the top a outstanding
tilt up to the old classroom full of kids getting their tests back
across the aisle looking at camera with disgust is a sixteen year old boy mumfords classmate
it made no sense that school came easy for me
i didnt do much work and there was a proud tradition in my family of being really dumb
my friends didnt like it much
it made them distrust me
from inside a helmet the brutal chaos of crashing bodies in a friday night high school football game
mumford is violently hit
our view is smashed so deep into the muddy turf that again the image goes black then quickly fades up again on tight on a can of iron city beer
in mumfords pov as he puts it on the roof of a green nash rambler and ducks into the back seat
in the shadows is a teen age girl mumfords date
as mumford moves toward her she flames a bic lighter and gleefully lights a fat joint her blouse is unbuttoned and gaping
on the other hand it made some of my classmates like me better
i dont know what it was in me maybe some genes from my mom maybe some discomfort with myself but early on i was drawn to any substance that made
mumfords pov moving across a platform toward the diploma being proffered by the principal
pan to mumfords parents dressed up and proud in the audience
when i got a scholarship to go out of state to college i was the first one in my extended family whod gone beyond high school
at graduation my folks looked like a normal happy couple which i guess they were about of the time
out in public
tight on a dorm room door as it is pushed open
mumfords new roommate a crazed middle class doper has his stuff spread around and is settled in the midst of the chaos
he looks up at the arriving mumford with a maniacal stoned smile
my roommate was from a planet i had never heard of called scarsdale where everything was the opposite of west virginia
tight on a bong filling with white smoke
we follow it up the tube to a pretty coed who inhales deeply then blows a seductive cloud directly at mumford
the room is full of partying students
all the other kids in fact seemed to know things i didnt
they were friendly enough but in four years i never got over feeling that i had sneaked in
and was about to be exposed as the hillbilly and imposter i actually was
funky decor red scarf over the lamp creating a sexy glow
mumfords pov moves toward an undulating shape hidden by a sheet on the bed
he reaches out and lifts the edge to reveal the pretty coed now naked giggling her extended hand offering a tab of acid right up to camera
the thing that always made those feelings go away was
fun was drugs fun was sex fun was aggressively doing nothing
the only problem i had with degenerate self destructive behavior was
i couldnt get enough of it
a professor approaches camera and lays a fresh examination on the desk in front of mumford
the problem is mumford is so doped up the classroom is swimming and the examination paper keeps changing shape
all that fun eventually had an impact on the work i was doing
i figured what the hell it was only college after all
id straighten up when i went out in the real world
tight on several amphetamine capsules being dumped into mumfords palm over a water fountain
they disappear toward camera as we dip down toward the stream of water
i didnt want to jump into my career right out of college
and since i had no career that turned out to be not much of a problem
mumfords pov lifts from the fountain and turns to the endless deserted corridor of the huge building
we begin tracking down the hall checking out the various doorways
a cleaning crew appears far up ahead
i had a series of challenging jobs over the next few years
we pan from the back of a garbage truck to a mess of garbage containers and move toward them
tight on two lines of cocaine
we dip toward them then up again and theyre gone
pan to reveal were in a closet off the brightly lit office of an all night gas station
a patron is waiting impatiently out by the pumps
back to present
skip watches mumford intently
pizza delivery pipe fitting pest control
lots of jobs that started with the letter p
for some reason i kept losing these jobs
takes a swig of beer the only mind altering substance i never had a problem with was alcohol
i never got drunk
i didnt like the feeling
but really when youre as fucked up as i was
mumford stands up and stretches then sits on the railing facing skip
eventually doing all these different jobs i noticed something
for some reason probably because i was too stoned to talk everywhere i went we see various co workers from mumfords jobs
the environments are radically different but the activity is always the same the co worker in question is pouring his heart out to camera
people would talk to me tell me everything
their stories their problems their innermost thoughts
sometimes theyd pretend they needed advice but mostly people just wanted someone to listen
mumfords moving pov as he crawls into the darkness an insecticide sprayer ahead of him
he pushes at a cinderblock anyway one day i was spraying for termites when i had a vision the cinderblock tips over and a swarm of scary looking spiders comes
rushing out toward camera
it was time to put my college degree to work and get a job with a desk
from behind a desk in the middle of a huge sea of desks
i took the civil service exam and found myself working at the internal revenue service district central administrative office
i started off as a general records clerk
series of shots computer records scrolling rapidly paper files being pulled documents being routed
i guess the standards werent too high there because my superiors got excited and pushed me to take the advancement tests
an intense basketball game
the ball zips from behind camera mumford to an older guy mumfords supervisor under the basket he lays it in easily then comes over to high five
one guy in particular thought i should be a revenue officer
there was more money to be made as your classification went up
which had a lot of appeal to me
a cocaine mill is loaded with white chunks and screwed shut in mumfords pov the steady grinding begins
spread across the messy kitchen table is the regular users paraphernalia
since even though i was certain i could stop anytime i wanted i had developed a real affection for cocaine
it was my favorite hobby i had ever had
mumfords pov shifts around the office
first hes looking at an irate taxpayer yelling across a desk at a revenue officer who remains unruffled but i sure didnt want to be a revenue officer where you
were face to face abusing and getting abused all day long
his pov pans with a couple of intense collection agents who pass behind the first scene on their way out of the offices
and being a collection agent was definitely not in my genetic make up
his pov stops letting the collection agents go on another fellow with the disreputable cocksure demeanor of a private dick who is lolling near the water cooler watching the altercation
he is gregory an irs but there was one job that looked like it might be fun investigator
are you telling me your last job before becoming a psychologist was back to present
skip is leaning intensely toward mumford
an investigator for the internal revenue service
everybody has a story skip
sounds like you have several
what it felt like was
a series of separate unconnected lives hillbilly kid wrecked college boy garbage man civil service guy
yul brynner accent et cetera
every time id leave a life it felt good
whatever problems i was having were suddenly gone
i had no friends and i didnt talk to my family
the only constant stabilizing force in my life was
an irs investigator with a drug problem
it wasnt the best situation
did you carry a gun
didnt need one
we didnt even need a warrant for most of the shit we did
man the irs
we could go in your bank account your credit cards
hell we used to go into doctors files and get all the juicy details
nobody wants to argue with the irs
moving pov as mumford follows gregory down the gloomy alley to a corner where they can spy at the scene beyond
i got teamed with one of the top guys a fanatic named gregory
he always got his man whether they deserved it or not
he was a closer and everybody admired that
what they see the dry cleaning boss a middle eastern fellow is standing at the back door of his place paying his asian employees in cash as they leave
hed make the case and the collection guys would come in and clean up
our specialty was
gregory turns to look at camera mumford with a devilish grin
we were a good team
i was a dope addict and gregory was insane
mumfords pov as he supports a drunken gregory as they stagger down the sidewalk to a row house
holding gregory up on the other side is candy gregorys pretty wife
they wrangle gregory up the front steps
gregory stumbles inside and mumford retreats down the steps his eyes still on the front door
candy appears there and stares down at mumford who stops where he is
of course him being insane didnt make it all right that i fell in love with his wife
mumford settles back in his chair as skip shakes his head astounded
announcer like get to know your therapist
you were messed up man
dry but look at me now
hey youve done good
look at yourself
youve cleaned up youve got a career skip stops remembers the truth realizes
at least you pulled yourself out
things got a lot worse
you and candy
mumfords pov from his bed
candy finishes dressing across the room
she looks at camera her face full of the pain of leaving
moving pov as mumford follows gregory up the ladder and onto the roof of this old building in a rundown industrial neighborhood
the way the district managers got ahead and won their bonuses was by generating maximum payments
that meant the revenue officers had to use all their collection tools seizures liens levies even if a more reasonable compromise could have been worked out
the best way to reduce resistance from the taxpayers was to build a convincing case whether thered actually been a violation or not
mumford follows gregory crawling to the edge of the roof and looks down on a building one block over
it is a small furniture factory
employees are eating their lunches on the loading dock
thats where we came in
our dm was a particular sonuvabitch and he knew just how to get gregory crazy
mumfords pov takes in his attractive date next to him then pans to candy and gregory across the table
candy flashes mumford a momentary special look
mumfords pov guiltily pans to gregory
did he see it
so several things were working on gregory when we started building a case against a furniture maker named edmond worrell
binocular view of edmond worrell and mrs
worrell as they get in a cadillac at the end of a workday
and his family
lit by powerful flashlights gregory and mumford attack the files of the company both in cabinets and on computer
gregory was acting more and more irrational
we started doing things that were over the line even for the irs
when i look back on it now im sure gregory must have known about candy and me
on our team i had become
extreme close up a line of cocaine on the top of a toilet tank as it is sucked out of sight
the responsible one
mumfords pov is a blurry shape until candy moves up and away her face sweaty and aroused torso naked
shes on top of mumford
mumfords pov slides into the passenger seat
gregory is already sitting in the drivers seat
he stares at mumford a long time
mumford is following gregory and revenue officer mclure down the hall
they reach a door with the painted sign samuel sometimes when a case didnt work out right gregory and this revenue officer named mclure would put the squeeze on the
as they start to enter soft cut to gorbeck listens intimidated by mclure who sits on the accountants desk and gregory who is moving around the office snooping
there arent many accountants who dont have something to worry about with the service
edmond worrell his wife his adult son and daughter worrells lawyer and finally the accountant gorbeck are ushered toward a conference room by mclure gregory and some other irs types
gorbeck sneaks a nervous look at mumford
gregory who now appears slightly mad motions for mumford to join them
the parties met repeatedly over a period of months
the irs offered to settle for a sizable but they said fair amount
worrell said hed done nothing wrong and threatened to fight it all the way to washington
he seemed pretty strong
i was secretly pulling for him
mclure and the district manager stepped up the pressure
moving pov out the windshield of gregorys government car as it comes speeding into the parking lot
there are two flashing squad cars and an ambulance at the entrance
as gregorys car hits a speedbump the image begins to slow down what none of us down at the service knew was that edmond worrell had a story too
worrells was that hed been fighting chronic depression for thirty years
under the heat of the investigation he fell off his medication
one tuesday morning he went down to the factory early wrote his family a letter then used the mm automatic they kept there to kill himself
the dm dropped the case that day and started proceedings to get rid of gregory
the image has slowed to a still
it now dissolves to mumfords pov as he comes up the steps
the front door opens before he gets there
candy her face bruised her eyes red comes into view she has a suitcase in hand
gregory went home drunk beat up candy and went out to drink some more
candy told me she didnt want to see me again
she hated us both and she was leaving us both
it made perfect sense to me
i felt the same way
mumford is frantically futilely looking for an imagined drug stash
hes ransacked the place and is now throwing the clothes out of a drawer
mumford looks desperately through the pill bottles and detritus in his squalid medicine cabinet
in fact i was jealous of candy
i wanted to leave too just like her
get as far away from giving up mumford slams the medicine cabinet shut and for the first time since his story began we see mumford in his previous incarnation
and this is probably as bad as he ever looked
he stares at his image in the mirror
skip is staring at mumford
empty beer bottles are lined up on the porch railing
and so you did
and the drugs
harder than i thought
took me three tries
but i was highly motivated figured there was no point in leaving me and taking that along
after two bomb outs i found a place in the desert
a venetian blind is raised revealing sunrise over a desert landscape
the joint wasnt fancy it was run by an order of monks but it worked
when i got out of there i was just about broke
mumford gets up from his chair and moves toward his door
which seemed perfect for starting something new
mumford goes inside
skip sits listening to the night
from downstairs in lilys apartment he hears a shower go on
mumford comes back out
somebodys taking a shower down there
thatd be lily
i wish i could live in the shower
id take five a day if i had the time
i went to this spa in germany a sanitarium practically up on this mountain
and the great thing they just kept you wet all day
whod you go with
skip alone thats not good
howd you do it
mumford is confused the new you
you know how easy it is
a kid can manage it if he wants a fake i
you can do practically the whole deal at your local kinkos
the only variable is how much pride you take in the product
i know it starts with a birth certificate
all new people start with that
on a computer screen an elaborate graphics program is creating the filigreed border of a birth certificate that already bears the official looking designs of green county state of west
with desktop publishing you dont have to deal with printers supply houses or pesky government agencies
eventually you do have to get your hands on a typewriter
ever seen one of those skip
as the border is completed we push in and dissolve through surface of a desk with an electric smith corona typewriter late s vintage
extreme close up of the keys hammering out individual letters and numbers date hospital attending physician
playing along is that like a mimeograph
what about the name
mumford looks at skip
what about it
i mean why pick the name of the town you were going to
you got it backwards
i already had the name when i started looking for somewhere to settle
when i saw this town on a map i thought maybe it was a sign
the typewriter is just pounding out michael oliver mum f o mickey mumford was in miss rices kindergarten class with me
he was killed with his parents in a wreck on their way back from a steelers game
he was only six years old which is a real plus so theres a birth certificate if anyone checks but not much else
they died in pennsylvania so theres no death certificate in west virginia
thats also good
on a kitchen table the new birth certificate now filled out for michael mumford is carefully lifted from a shallow bowl of light tea the tea bags are nearby
the paper has taken on an aged sepia look
cut to a stack of books
the ones on top are lifted away
the bottom book is opened to reveal the birth certificate
it has been folded in an official way
now mumford unfolds it then refolds it differently with its smudges and creases its starting to look old
and a birth certificate is enough
everything flows from that and what doesnt
can be easily purchased
series of shots of mumfords documentation piling up
a post office box is emptied official looking correspondence is opened the bounty is laid out for perusal social security card drivers license college and graduate school diplomas license and
accreditation to operate as a therapist
of course my irs training made it easier
once youve done that theres not much data you cant access and use any way you want
in a free society you are who you say you are
smiling people should remember that before they go around knocking this country
he gets up skip all this beers got me sleepy
skip looks upset
but you studied psychology right
you did the training and just never got the degree
hopeful psych major
but youre good at it
i understand what its like to want to leave a problem behind
thats all most people are looking to do
shrugs mainly i listen
he heads inside
where ya going
ive got a million questions
see you thursday
mumford goes inside
skip nods head spinning
mumford and sofie are delivering newspapers in lovely first light
mumford has a canvas sack full of newspapers around his neck
at each house he consults the list in his hand then hands sofie a rolled up paper which she throws with varying success toward the front doors
the activity is tiring for her but shes committed
so we get on this incredible steam engine train that runs up into the mountains
she tosses a paper grunting and this trip is everything its cracked up to be
an open car great views the mountain air blowing through
were sitting there married for six years and he says how he likes it better when i put my hair back
mumford hands her another paper which she heaves with all her limited strength missing the front porch badly
mumford who cant get enough of watching her doesnt notice at first
that wasnt so good
mumford snaps out of it
he goes up on the lawn and flips the paper deftly onto the porch
as they continue youre doing great
i dont know if im going to make it the whole way
it doesnt matter
this makes me sound irrational which is probably right but there was something about him saying this it was maybe the millionth time hed told me about some preference of
well i was so
tired of it
memories seems like my whole life someones been telling me
im just not getting it right
can we rest for a second
she leans against the iron handrail on some front steps breathing hard
youre purposely making me talk while we do this
mumford nods because you think this is good for me
nods again and youre a sadistic bastard
who thinks theres nothing really wrong with me
oh theres something wrong with you all right
especially after hearing that dream of yours about the roto rooter
theyre playing with each other
that was really bad wasnt it
and ill bet you can interpret the whole thing its pretty obvious to a trained professional
sofie starts walking again taking another newspaper from his sack
he points to the next house
i hate those dreams where everything means something
sofie heaves the paper squarely onto the porch
she turns to him with pride but when she sees the way he looks at her she glances away uncomfortable
is that when you split up
no thatd be a good story but that was just the beginning of the end
we went on for another year or so
mumford hands her another paper and indicates the next house
so whose route is this
fourteen years old
lives next door
and hes where
in the capitol for boys nation
heaves another paper im thinking a gal could make a good living doing this
how hard could it be squeezing out some fourteen year old
you like it
its all right
then you can expect me at tomorrow morning
and this is legitimate therapy
hell no i just dont want to do it alone
tight on rapid series of images on slick glossy magazine pages each change of image is punctuated by the amplified snap of the page being turned like a gunshot
were so close to the images we cant tell when the magazines change from glamour to vogue to us to mademoiselle to w to vanity fair
and it doesnt matter
whether the images are ads or fashion spreads or celebrity candids the look is the same jaded hip disinterested apathetic either impossibly buff or anorexic but always severely beautiful
the page turning starts at a fevered pitch and becomes even more intense
finally what is it nessa
the images continue
isnt she amazing
that is such a wicked look
what do you want me to see
just chill for a second
look at this guy it appears hes actually dead
mumford is sitting next to nessa on the couch
at their feet is a mess of magazines
nessa discards one and immediately starts flipping through a new one beneath it
she is very agitated
mumford stands up walks over and sits in his chair
what are you doing
were not done
i just need to find the thing
if you dont want to have a session today its okay
i want to have the session
i thought it would be cool if i could show you some of the things that interest me
but i guess youre not into it
which we already knew
what happened today
what are you talking about
was it something that happened at school
petulant these appointments were not my idea remember
should we stop them
a look of panic crosses nessas face but she instantly hides it busily taking out cigarette and lighter which she doesnt use
instead she lies down on the couch balancing the closed magazine on her chest
i dont think you know what youre talking about
this shrink school you went to
did you hear about it on an infomercial
nessa refers to the magazine beneath her chin
i want to live in the world these people are in
no one ever says anything in there have you noticed
so theyre very cool
like theyre all really deep
its when people start talking that everything goes to shit
nessa suddenly seems on the edge of tears but beats it back
theres this kid at school
he has some gigantic idea of himself that no one else shares
you wouldnt believe the crap he lays on me
who appointed him my spiritual leader
if he has everything so figured out how come his best friend is a
and whys he spend all his time chasing after me
probably thinks im gonna give him a hummer
do you think thats what he wants
after a beat no
i dont know what he wants
but i know i dont like being watched
nobodys ever paid any attention to what i did and i liked it just fine
where does he get off telling me i disrespect myself
a beat fuck him
look in a mirror bozo
mumford crosses the street from his office
a huge bus with applejack tours on the sides is disgorging its passengers a large group of elderly japanese women all of whom file neatly into lilys cafe
lily stands on the sidewalk outside greeting them merrily
whats the deal
lily continues her welcomes but points out a hand lettered sign in her front window closed for lunch
see you tomorrow
they come through a few times each year
greeting one cheerily hello mrs
saito good to see you again
back to mumford its a tour
where am i supposed to eat
youre on your own today honey
mumfords attention is suddenly drawn to something across the street
he glances thoughtfully at lily for a moment then back out there
what he sees skip is once again zipping down the street on his skateboard in the midst of traffic
he has not noticed mumford
skip looks over then immediately changes course toward them barely checking the surrounding traffic
he is extraordinarily skillful
when he gets to the curb he pulls a snazzy board flipping maneuver to dismount and come up on the sidewalk
some of the japanese matrons react with delight
skip notices the tour members filing by but is immediately distracted by the presence of lily whos a little excited to meet the local celebrity
lily i want you to meet skip
its a pleasure to meet you
me you too
i was at your house
upstairs with doc
yeah its very nice
i heard your shower
skip cant believe what he just said
neither can the other two actually
mumford cant stop himself from laughing but he cuts it off fast
lily blushes but skips agitation has charmed her
somethings happening here
ive seen you going by on your board but i didnt realize youre so young
to be so
gives him a look so accomplished
i may be young but doc can tell you im very immature
hes making a joke and it represents quite a recovery
theyre all relieved
then theres an awkward silence
skip watches the last of the tour enter the restaurant
so is this like a japanese restaurant
id better get in there
thats a lot of people all at once
they pre order
theres a choice of three entrees
what are they
lily gives him a careful look is he really interested
theres something about him
meat loaf turkey quesadillas or salad nicoise
i love salad nicoise
giggling you do
well come on in
she motions him in and starts to follow
mumford makes a what about me
lily grinning just points to the sign and leaves mumford standing on the sidewalk
mumford turns to find dr
delbanco and phyllis sheeler the shrinks lionel had conferred with standing nearby
it takes a moment for mumford to remember delbanco
finally shaking hands dr
its nice to see you again
i dont think you know dr
shes the other therapist here in town
shaking her hand of course
ive heard great things about you
you never got back to me
mumford doesnt understand i called to say wed like to take you out for a meal
kind of a professional welcome
mumford makes a show of remembering
forgive me please
what a gracious thought
we must do that
why dont i call you when ive got my calendar in front of me
what are you doing for lunch
the other two nod in unison
mumford considers trapped
the towns upscale dining spot
mumford delbanco and sheeler are in a red leather booth
sheeler listens with rapt admiring attention as delbanco speaks annihilation anxieties engendered by bad experiences with a depriving mother
but no one can escape the fear of death
it is as henry james put it the worm at the core
try as we may to forget or ignore our mortality james said theatrically the skull will grin in at the banquet
mumford nods appreciatively
he really is an extraordinary listener
delbanco catches his own vanity in sheelers adoring gaze and becomes self conscious ive run on
were here to talk about you
covering what ernest means i think is were very interested in other methodology
different kinds of training
were great believers in learning from each other
ive learned so much from ern dr
and i from phyllis
back to a previous thread so
the university of kentucky
who runs the program down there
my mentor was an amazing teacher named benton mandlebaum
died quite tragically in the collapse of a gazebo
i think ive heard of him
a disciple of rothberg wasnt he
mumfords response and all that follow is calm and pleasant
i dont know about that
i suppose your extended training was at an institution in that area
lots of institutions
my graduate advisor believed we should experience as many environments as possible prisons clinics half way houses
for a while i was chief therapist in a shopping mall
had a little spot next to the yogurt place
what was his name
she passed last year in a train wreck
delbanco and sheeler exchange a look
sheeler adopts a casual tone i trained in the east myself cornell and i dont care what anyone says there really are regional differences
i found the state certification exams out here quite harrowing
oh yeah very tough
but i guess thats good
to keep out the quacks
which examiner did you have
i probably know him
a dark look comes over sheelers face for a moment
that was a terrible thing
agrees i dont even know why hang gliding is considered a legitimate sport
back on track were interested in any new therapies
how would you characterize your approach
your particular approach
i dont have one really
most of the time im faking it
see i think theres not much that can be done about most problems
theyre too complicated too deep rooted by the time i hear about them
the most i can do usually is look and listen real closely try to catch some glimpse of the secret life everybodys got
if i can get a sense of that well then maybe
just maybe i can help them out a little
mumford sits back considering the couple across the table
his gaze is so crystalline that after a moment they become uncomfortable and steal a glance at each other
finally i see
close on althea brockett
the argument had nothing to do with it
i just want to know what the argument was about
hates to say i had ordered some books
the greatest books ever written
what are they
oh all the great writers shakespeare charles dickens moby dick
each is bound in genuine premium leather with carat gold accents
its a magnificent set and only
right away you get great expectations for just
one hundred books
it had nothing to do with what happened
althea is sitting on the couch facing mumford
she has a bulky knit cardigan sweater hugged tightly around her the only sign that shes not completely calm
we argued on sunday
he went to work on monday and stayed in the city during the week like always
but on thursday when he normally comes home he didnt
didnt call either
not till saturday afternoon
you must have been concerned
its happened before
a beat im shocked by how little im feeling
i cant understand it
a real question ill probably have a complete depressoid collapse soon wont i
what did he say
he said he wasnt coming back
he said it wasnt working for him any more
that it hadnt worked for him for quite a while
you know what i regret the most
im sorry i let him make the kids take his name
he was an acquirer
off mumfords look he liked to acquire things
mumford looks away
althea realizes what hes thinking
you think that has something to do with my problem
ordering all those things
it hadnt occurred to mumford but its an interesting thought
like i was on some kind of campaign to out acquire him
excited now playing it out if i was just an acquisition to him and he lost interest once he had me she stops shakes her head
that cant be it
its too simple
and besides i still like it
this morning i ordered a marble turtle cheese board from the horchow collection
an odd look can i tell you something just awful
you know how people who are just assholes will sometimes look at a woman whos got problems and say what she needs is a good shtupping
well there may be something to that
jeremy didnt keep up his end oh what difference does it make
suddenly why do i feel elated
am i in denial
you know what it feels like
she glances at her watch then starts talking fast i know my times up but ive got to get this out while ive got hold of it take your time
no slowing down when i was in high school the thing i wanted most when i was stuck in class the thing i was always desperately in pursuit of was
a hall pass
thats all i wanted
i loved moving freely around the school while everybody else was trapped in there
and thats how i feel right now
like i have some giant all day hall pass
she is beaming but suddenly becomes self conscious
she stands up abruptly flushed
my god did it just get hot in here or what
she takes off the bulky sweater and bends to pick up her purse
she is wearing a simple cotton dress that buttons up the front and hugs her body
we see for the first time what all her other outfits have hidden althea has a terrific voluptuous figure
see you next time
ill probably be a basket case by then
she heads toward the door to the waiting room
mumford indicates the back door
you can go out there if you like
quoting mumford theres no shame in getting a little therapy right doc
she opens the door to the waiting room startling henry follett who jumps up from a chair out there magazine still in hand
follett is embarrassed to be discovered here
but thats secondary to the impact altheas current appearance sexy body framed in the doorway is having on him
shes been a customer in his store but hes seeing her now as if for the first time
all his libidinous buttons are being pushed
althea breezes by oblivious to his reaction
have a good session
she goes out
but follett continues to stare in the direction althea has gone
mumford is being escorted across the spectacular atrium by a panda security aide
her informal uniform and all the other details in the building carry out the panda design motif
as they head down the main corridor hey doc
mumford looks that way
in the distance skip is descending from an upper level on his skateboard via a unique system of ramps designed for that purpose alone
none of the hustling panda employees in the area take any particular notice of the sight
skip meets mumford and his escort at the bottom of the ramp with a spectacular stop
thanks jennifer ill take him from here
the security aide retreats as skip riding slowly alongside leads mumford into a side corridor
series of shots
skip and mumford move through a maze of hallways with progressively less foot traffic
ive never brought anyone down here before
doc theres something about what you told me the other night i cant get out of my head
its driving me batty mumford nods waits why me
how did you know you could trust me
youre completely reliable
skip is pleased
they approach a heavy steel door the entrance to skips workshop
a very old security aide sits at the end of the intersecting hallway watching this area
skip shouts down there its just me dino
the old man nods barely awake
skip ive got a problem and i need some advice
you want my advice
skip puts his hand in a scanning device in the wall
some lights blink and the heavy metal door pops open a few inches
skip has to put all his weight into opening the door
he hesitates suddenly concerned i hope nothing youre about to see will shake your faith in me
mumford reassures him with a look
skip pushes the door open far enough for them to enter then pulls it closed behind them
mumford and skip enter the large windowless workspace
what at first appears chaotic is in fact carefully organized
many different disciplines interface here the body section the first thing one notices some incredibly life like anatomically correct sculpture mannequins both male and female
you half expect them to breathe
from there a full wall of forms descends from store mannequins and skeletons all the way down to a huge variety of inflatable sex dolls
the cyber section a dizzying array of computers and screens some showing wire form outlines of body parts in repeated motion
above them on a huge corkboard hundreds of computer generated renderings of skin eyes limbs sexual organs
the body parts section medical models of teeth eyes lips limbs
hundreds of porn store samples plastic dildos rubber vaginas sucking machines and sundry genitalia
the form casting shop all the machinery you need to make rubber and acrylic forms of anything that can be computer designed
all these weird objects are set upon shiny spotless high tech work surfaces
skip watches mumford move about in awe picking up the odd item
pretty creepy huh
are you totally disgusted
no skip youre a visionary
that can be a burden
this doesnt seem a little
there are a lot of lonely people in the world
somebodys gonna figure this out someday
its not going to be me
im giving it up
its all your fault
in the last hours ive completely lost interest
whatd i do
skip looks at mumford a wide grin on his face
gets it skip thats great
you and lily
oh she doesnt know about it yet
right now of the two of us im the only one in love
but im very stoked
skip settles in front of the body parts section framed by an array of limbs and sex toys
theres an assembled pelvic section with upper legs lying in the clutter behind him
doc how i can be of help to you
skip leans back against the table and accidentally hits a button
the pelvic section begins to hump slowly and sensually in place
its amazingly life like but it makes a mechanical whirring sound
skip fumbles to turn it off
skip gets the pelvis switched off and turns back to mumford
im here for you doc
skip you know that its improper completely unethical for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with one of his patients
i guess that makes sense
yes yes it does
mumford sinks into silence
he begins to wander the room
youve fallen in love with one of your patients
skip is desperate to say something useful
suddenly he has an alarming thought
its not me is it
mumford understands and cant stop a laugh
no skip its not you
but i like you a lot
skip is relieved
he has another thought and brightens
doc what about this
youre not really a licensed psychologist
mumford turns to meet skips gaze
skip realizes the ramifications of what hes just said
i guess that doesnt help
i see where youre going here
its a mess
lionel is here with delbanco and sheeler
this time delbanco is behind his desk sheeler across the room on the sofa
dont you find it incredibly convenient that everyone who could possibly corroborate his story has recently died some exotic death
theyre neither all recent nor exotic
but theyre certainly dead
and yes personally i find it a bit odd
it could happen
what about his state certification exams
the records seem to be in order
lionels derisive snort is so obnoxious its hard to bear
whats easier than hacking your way into a state computer and inserting some numbers
for all you know he never even took the exams
i dont know that its all that easy
doctor correct me if im wrong but it sounds to me like youve gone for this guys story hook line and bull twaddle
you do seem much more disposed toward him than i understand ernest
did i miss something
sharply oh for gods sake phyllis we have no reason to doubt the man
are we listening to lionel now
sheeler jumps so shocked is she by his outburst and so humiliated for lionel to witness it
fighting tears and trying to maintain her dignity she gathers up her things and walks to the door
delbanco immediately contrite stands up
phyllis im sorry
i didnt mean to shout
delbanco it is i who am sorry
sorry to have wasted your time with such
she breaks into tears and rushes out of the office
delbanco is left facing lionel who gives him exactly the look the doctor least wants to see
mumford is eating his lunch at the counter
he watches lily busily working the midday rush
she sees him grinning at her but doesnt say anything for a while
finally blushing stop it
hes a kid
im old enough to be his
mumford smiles eats
cook opens the front door to mumford
please come in
mumford comes in reluctantly
i was wondering if sofie was around
were you supposed to have a session
its sort of spur of the moment
mumford follows mr
cook into the room
cook and sofies thirtyish brother ben are in there watching television
cook keeps knitting ben stands to shake mumfords hand muting the tv with a remote
look whos here
have you met sofies moth weve met
and our son ben
vigorously shakes hands this is a real honor doctor
have a seat will ya
mumford continues to stand
well actually i cant really
do you think i could see sofie
ive been wanting to meet you
icy sofies not here
cook speaks with some pleasure
her friend from the city came and took her out to dinner
first time in a long time shes been willing
we owe that to you
shes perked up a lot since you started treating her
cook gives ben a condescending look and keeps knitting
whatd you want
theres something i think we need to talk about
i think we have a right
we certainly do not
keep it zipped ben
ben gives mumford an exasperated look but doesnt argue
is there something we need to know dr
mumford is conflicted not sure what to share with them
yes i guess i should tell you
i dont think im going to be able to treat sofie anymore
cook and ben exchange an alarmed glance
cook actually cheers up
finally some common sense
what do you mean
i think you know what i mean
no i really dont
i think you do
why dont you tell me
very calm why dont you go to hell
its all a bunch of nonsense and you know it
elizabeth im tellin you stop this
dismissive youre telling me
standing up id better go
why cant you see sofie
i know the treatments working
mumford looks from ben to mr
cook who nods his agreement
you see the problem is the problem is youre a big fake
you havent got a clue whats wrong with that girl
mumford looks at mrs
cook and cant stifle a laugh
take a hike dr
ignoring her now what is the problem doctor
mumford cant take his eyes off mrs
cook even as he speaks to mr
i guess there is no problem
uh this friend of sofies whered he take her
its she roxy
used to work with her
i think they went over to the lantern
delighted oh roxy
cook looks at him sharply
shes heard what the other two have not
mumford carries a large fed ex box down a side street and into an alley
as he passes a secluded space created by two adjacent buildings something catches his eye
mumfords moving pov a young couple is embracing and talking intimately
as they separate we can see that it is nessa and martin brockett
martin sees mumford but makes no sign
nessa twists to see what martins looking at just as the view is interrupted by a wall
mumford walks on mulling what hes seen
there is a locked security screen at the alley entrance to the back room of the pharmacy but the door inside is open
when a young pharmacist appears in there mumford raps on the metal screen
folletts private space is above and at the back of his drugstore
when you sit at his desk and in front of it as follett and mumford are doing now you can see down into the store through a floor to ceiling
one way mirror
the fed ex box sits on the desk between the two men unopened
what is it
its a thought i had
should i open it now
mumford seems hesitant but nods
follett takes out an exacto knife and makes the first incision but as hes about to go on mumford suddenly reaches out and stops him
let me just say something here
i have no idea if this is going to help
what exactly is it supposed to do
you remember when i asked you about pornography i find it degrading
maximum gynecology and minimum turn on and you told me that
still theres some kind of imagery thats haunting you and i think getting in your way which i dont necessarily agree
but you did come to me
its true even if he keeps forgetting
my guess is these images were burned into your brain when you were young
maybe if we could nail down the exact fantasies that are haunting you maybe you could get past them
anyway i thought we could try an experiment
indicating the box and the experiment is in here
mumford nods but suddenly looks depressed distracted
you know what
i think this was a dumb idea
he starts to take hold of the box
i just heard myself talking and i realize im completely unqualified to be doing this
lets forget the whole thing
follett grabs the box back
whoa whoa what are you doing
i want to know whats in here
pulling on the box theres absolutely no reason to think this is going to have any impact on you
im embarrassed to have follett stands up and grabs the box taking sole possession
i agree with you that you dont know what youre talking about
thats what ive been saying all along
and i can guarantee you that looking at the lost ark or whatever you got in here is not going to mean diddly to me
quieting down but if you think im going to let you walk out of here without seeing whats in this box you dont know much about henry a
mumford gives up
follett gestures to ask whether its safe to put the box on the desk mumford reassures him
now with much more anticipation and ceremony than before follett carefully cuts open the package
the contents of the box is revealed as follett opens the flaps
there is an inner brown paper wrapping upon which has been set a low rent catalogue metropolitan collectibles periodicals erotica adult nostalgia
follett lifts away the wrapping there are perhaps a dozen mens magazines of the late fifties and early sixties nugget adam the adam reader swank dude
plus several cartoon collections sex to sexty stag humor
plus trashy adult novels of the era with provocative illustrations on the covers night call nurse the neighbors have no curtains secretarial sluts etc
finally two video tapes both of russ meyer films mudhoney and common law we stay close on the contents of the box as folletts hands shuffle through it rapidly flipping
through the pages
very soft core by todays standards the common thread is clear voluptuous heavy breathing sirens in tight clothes and out of them tempting muscular he man drifters or libidinous businessmen
a world of lusty secretaries siren babysitters and frustrated neglected wives
in other words exactly the erotic ambience of folletts fantasies
slow tilt up to folletts face
he is transported mesmerized galvanized
in fact at this moment as the music swells a tear is rolling down his cheek
he dare not take his eyes from this holy grail to look up at mumford
the only thing that could wreck his mood now is mr
follett follett jumps startled from his revery
as the young pharmacist steps tentatively into the office follett jams everything back into the box as best he can and tries to cover it
what the hell is so important i cant have five minutes
the young pharmacist is cowed and doesnt advance into the room
its her sir
you told me to get you when she came to pick up her prescription
it takes follett a moment to understand but when he does his whole manner changes
he dismisses the young pharmacist with a nod then gives a quick self conscious glance to mumford
uh sorry im going to have to
indicates box i really appreciate what youre trying to
uh i cant thank you enough for
follett heads for the door pausing briefly at a mirror to check his appearance pushing at his hair with his palm
ill see you on
he hurries out
mumford stands up to leave but first looks down through the one way mirror
what he sees follett hurries up behind the prescription counter where althea brockett is waiting once again she looks quite sexy
follett brings her prescription up and begins playfully flirting
althea is responsive
follett motions althea down the aisle where its more private
he comes out from behind the counter ostensibly to show althea something on the prescription bottle
althea leans back against some shelves in the same posture as the landlady in folletts first fantasy
mumford reacts bemused
mumford and sofie make their way slowly up the trail
despite her labored breathing its clear sofie has made enormous progress since we first saw her
when i was in high school we used to come up here and make out
i liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down
thats what i like
whyd you come to the house the other night
i thought i had something to tell you
but it turned out i didnt
my brother said you were about to fire me
thats one way to put it
i bet i know what changed your mind
mumford looks at her my mother
she was so horrible you decided you couldnt desert me
i thought only action movies had villains like that
sofie gestures ahead
thats the cut off isnt it
mumford nods i know why you were going to quit seeing me
mumford slows at this
sofie heads off the trail into the woods
sofie appears first but she waits for mumford before she steps tentatively onto the rock
mumford takes firm hold of her and leads her to a spot where she can securely settle herself
you feel like a fake an imposter
mumford looks up sharply
as if maybe you dont know what youre doing
she puts a hand on his arm
everybody feels that way sometimes
like were not who were supposed to be
but i have to tell you dr
mumford he winces at her formality
youve been a tremendous help to me
i cant tell you how much i admire you
you have a wonderful way with people
and youre very insightful
i feel like youve seen me clearly
i never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was
youve made that possible for me
and my ex husband he never accepted me for who i was just like mother
the things youve said have helped me understand what a dick he is
i dont know if youre shockingly honest thats what makes you great
ive never had a man treat me this way
with you i feel really
gives him a look can i tell you something
its a little embarrassing but i feel very unguarded with you
thanks to this therapy i now know what im looking for
i need to find a man like you
laughs not one whos treating me of course
full of resolve and im going to do it dammit
youve given me the confidence
mumford is in agony
that makes me very happy
nessas on the couch playing with her usual unlit cigarette
theres an uncharacteristic lightness to her
i mean doc the dude is seriously deluded
i said that to him i said if you think im gonna do all that shit for you man you are seriously deluded
whatd he say
cant hide her pleasure he said which we already knew
mumford laughs delighted
what did he want you to do
first off he tells me to stop smoking cigarettes
i told him abso fuckin lutely no
as you can see she holds up the cigarette as though it were her middle finger flipping the bird
then he says stop smoking dope
so then he says he doesnt want me getting together with any other guys
mumford doesnt have to see her face to know how much pleasure this gives her despite her hard ass cover
what balls on this guy
too geeky for her going steady
long pause i said id consider it
nobody owns me
and the last thing was insane
i dont know whats wrong with him
i dont know if i can quit
were gonna try it together like you know aa or something
and i made him give up his
no more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune
yes hes pitiful doc a goddam puppy
i dont know how much longer i can put up with it
i already got two arms and legs i dont need another appendage
she takes a look at her watch and immediately lights her cigarette as she stands up oops
she heads toward the waiting room
mumford gestures to indicate the back door
she waves him off
he shakes his head no one wants to use the back anymore
nessa opens the door to the waiting room
martin brockett is sitting there
he makes a gesture to nessa to underline the fact that he is not reading any of the many magazines lying around then stands up
she goes into his arms like maybe shes the puppy
he beams and looks at mumford
pulling nessa tighter did you straighten her out
nessa give him an affectionate punch in the side then blows smoke in his face
how are you
didnt ja hear
my family got five hundred times better
turning nessa lets go vanessa
nessa gives mumford an embarrassed aint he corny
look but as they go out the door shes never looked happier
mumford is startled to find a man in a suit gilroy rising from the chair behind the door
hes got a briefcase and a document in his hand
i didnt see you there
can i help you
my names gilroy
im from the state certification board
he proffers the document in his hand but mumford doesnt take it
its all right it wont bite you
under civil code
b you are entitled to be notified that your status and certification are being reviewed
this is the notice
takes the paper do you want to come in
already leaving no thanks
plenty of time for that when were a little further along
gilroy gilroy stops outside door already open
what brought this on
im not at liberty to say
sometimes its just routine sometimes theres been a complaint
well be in touch
he goes out
mumford considers the paper in his hands thoughts elsewhere
close on a packing carton half full of books
pulling back and floating over other boxes half packed with mumfords personal belongings he doesnt have a lot
on the bed an open suitcase with a few clothes thrown in
were still moving across the room and out onto the porch to reveal mumford in his chair nursing a beer looking up at the starry sky
mumford hears the shower go on downstairs at lilys
then the murmur and giggle of a wet couple
he gets up and goes inside closing the door behind him so as not to violate their privacy
he goes to the suitcase takes out some clothes and begins putting them back in the dresser
right now hes not going anywhere
extreme close up of ernest delbanco
we cant tell where he is at first
as he speaks we pull back to reveal him lying on mumfords couch a patient
and when you said at lunch about everybody having a secret life something just snapped inside me
i knew i could no longer continue my relationship with dr
it was tearing me up inside
and i know phyllis wasnt getting what she needed from it
what had started as a genuine respect i think for each others professional abilities and became over time a personal attraction had somehow
migrated into a rather torrid sexual relationship
across the room mumford sits chin in hand displaying no reaction
i wont go into that today
though if we should continue these sessions as i certainly hope we will there are some aspects of that i would like to look at
god knows ive listened to enough people giving me the juicy catches himself at any rate i just wanted to acknowledge the catalyzing effect your comment had on me
i just hope that it doesnt come roiling back upon you like some dreadful undertow
how do you mean
this next is painful for delbanco
you see when i broke it off with phyllis she was naturally upset and she became more determined than ever to pursue certain how to put it doubts shes been
what kind of doubts
your background and your qualifications
im afraid phyllis somehow got you mixed up in her fury with me and actually took the whole issue to the state board
mumford digests this
and please for whatever small way i may have encouraged this accept my apologies
brightens there is good news though
phyllis has decided to leave town and pursue her practice in the city
which leaves you the only psychologist in town
sheeler is leaving mumford
im sorry to hear that
as you can imagine my own feelings about this are mixed
unlike i must say those of my wife
mumfords head snaps up
he had no idea delbanco was married
we camera are being pummelled by three small town toughs behind old man sutters gas station diner in the folletts fantasy town
in black white
beyond them old man sutters stacked young wife watches in horror from the backdoor of the building
we do not see the newcomer yet
old man sutters young bride had got me in hot water all right and now i was bein dealt the beating of my life
if thered just been two of those bastards it would have been a little closer
one of the toughs winds up and delivers the coup de grace
cut to black then fade up on still in subjective camera as the concerned landlady cleavage foremost stands away from us having patted the unseen newcomers face with a washcloth
beyond her near the half open door stands her cheerleader daughter worriedly chewing on her thumb
the landlady was good at quite a few things but doctoring wasnt one of them
cut to reverse and see the hero who this time is actually played by henry follett appearing in his own fantasy for the first time
hes lying in bed his face bruised in the manner of a fifties movie
lucky for me one of the other boarders the broad who lived downstairs in the front room
back at the door the cheerleader hears someone coming and steps aside to make way for althea brockett dressed now in a nurses uniform so tight the buttons are straining
was a nurse
as the landlady and the cheerleader retreat out the door althea the nurse sways forward toward the bed bearing bandages and a bowl of steaming water a lascivious look of
concern on her face
and she had ways to make you feel better they didnt teach in nursing school
althea the nurse places a bandage over folletts eyes mumford sits beaming at henry follett on the couch
mumfords glance takes in the clock and he stands up signalling the end of the session
follett snaps out of his revery and gets up
im very happy for you henry
mumford surprisingly takes folletts hand and shakes it vigorously
i feel like were making real progress here
me too doc
and i cant tell you what that package meant to me mumford stops him with a dont mention it gesture
follett accepts and goes out the back door
mumford is pleased someone still wants to use that door
mumford returns to his desk and begins reading some papers when he hears the entry door to the waiting room
not expecting anyone he checks the clock then goes to his office door and opens it
sofie is standing there very agitated just about to knock
she peers past him to see if hes alone
i need to talk to you
can i come in
sofie sits on the couch
mumford sits in his chair facing her
her voice is as strained as her manner
we havent met in this office since that first time
this is how a real professional and his client are supposed to see each other
it mightve been more appropriate if we had followed a traditional approach to the doctor patient relationship
is something wrong sofie
yes somethings very wrong dr
that must take years of training right there
maybe you can guess what has upset me
mumford considers a long moment several scenarios racing through his mind
finally carefully is it something youve heard about me
no it is not something ive heard about you
it is someth stops suddenly why
is there something i should have heard about you
why dont you tell me whats on your mind
sofie suddenly finds it difficult to look into his eyes she looks around frenetically for a moment
then indicating the couch may i
mumford gestures of course
sofie swings her legs up and lies on the couch so they can no longer see each others face
its the most vigorous movement shes yet shown us
this seems to help sofie a bit
im going to come right out and say this because thats what your shrink is for right so you can tell him whats bothering you
tone still rough first of all i have been feeling much better lately
i dont know if the syndrome is over if its just run its course or something but i feel a hundred per cent better than when i first came to
given that im obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way
i dont follow you
sharply im saying that since im doing so much better which i attribute to you im liable to misinterpret some of my feelings
the point is this i am not a blank page
i did not just fall off the turnip truck
do you know what i mean
i think so
i know a little about psychology
i took three different courses in college
its true none of them were above the two hundred level but i took them
and there was one concept i remember very well
what was that
yes and that is what i have got right now
i have taken my feelings of gratitude
and transferred them onto
i have taken all those warm grateful emotions and confused them with feelings for you
so that now i am under the delusion
a deep breath that i am in love with you
mumford appears frozen in his chair
there is a heavy silence in the room
sofie does not look back there
i think you can understand why i have some serious questions about your methods
i mean obviously it becomes much more likely that im going to have confusion about this when your idea of treatment is to go walking in the woods and up
to make outs ville and do all these highly romantic activities suddenly sofies voice cracks
she is starting to cry but refuses to acknowledge it
we had a paper route together for godssake
do you understand how i might be a little resentful
knowing that this so called love im feeling is totally bogus and just a pathetic case of
mumford doesnt know what to say
hes on the rack
then sofie gets up wiping at tears with the back of her bare hand
mumford jumps up to offer her a tissue but she ignores it
she will not meet his gaze
maybe you ought to think about how youre going to fix this
and when you do
suddenly losing her will please get back to me
sofie turns to go out through the waiting room but after a step she stops pirouettes and goes out the back
mumford comes up the street lost in thought and turns into the driveway toward his stairs
ainge leaps over the front yard fence
mumford pets the dog distractedly still moving
lily rises up suddenly from where shes been working in the garden
keeps walking lily
mumford reluctantly stops
lily comes up to the fence
i dont want you to be mad at skip
he told you
yes skip and i wouldnt have got together if it werent for you
thats a big deal
dismisses it you would have met in some shower eventually
i want to give you something
will you let me
thanks lily i dont need anything
yes you do you damn well do
cant fight okay
here it is some advice do the hard thing
thats what youre giving me
clean up the mess
no matter what it takes
mumford leans down to pet ainge
what it might take is
thats tough i mean it
im not unsympathetic
but skip says youre in love
mumford straightens looks at lily and acknowledges it
then its worth it
mumford looks at lily a long moment then leans over the fence and kisses her on the forehead
ainge jumps back over to her side
ill tell her tonight
mumford turns and continues toward his stairs
mumford comes in drops his coat gets a carton of orange juice out of the fridge and drinks directly from it
distracted he picks up the remote from the kitchen counter and switches on the tv then opens his freezer and stares inside
unsolved mysteries comes on
the opening segment previews a story about a couple who claim to have had a visitation from gianni versace then one about a yacht that went down near venezuela
robert stack in his characteristic fragmented delivery intones the preview for the last story accompanied by appropriate footage a drug rehabilitation center in the lonely southwestern desert
run by reclusive monks
becomes the point of departure in a mysterious vanishing
a close up of an irs identification card featuring a picture of a younger mumford badly photographed in suit and tie
his name is not visible
as an intrepid government investigator disappears without a trace
in the kitchen mumford spins to look
dissolve to later in the program
documentary shots of irs headquarters etc
are intercut with hokey looking re enactments from mumfords life with a young actor who looks vaguely like mumford playing him
in mumfords apartment the telephone is ringing
clearly its not the first time
mumford watching the show intently lifts the headset an inch from the cradle and then hangs up
when it immediately rings again mumford takes it off the hook cuts off the call and buries the headset under a sofa cushion
on the show scenes of tax investigation in the shows version the irs guys have drawn guns and are storming houses are interspersed with scenes of sordid drug taking
despite brilliant promise as a fearless investigator
found himself on a downward spiral of drug abuse and dissolution
mumfords sister the real thing a plain middle aged west virginia woman appears in a dramatic badly lit interview
as with all the interviewees she is identified by a supered title
we didnt talk much after our folks died but i know he felt his life had taken a wrong turn
a snapshot of some irs era party happy revelers posing for a flash
camera pushes in on mumford smiling and high his neck encircled by gregorys arm
candy is on the other side of gregory
a shot of the pennsylvania turnpike as a state police cruiser zips by
his former undercover partner at the irs
is now a trooper with the pennsylvania state police
gregory in state police uniform with a sadistic glint in his eye is interviewed by the roadside cars whipping by
the guy was obsessed
didnt always know where to draw the line
but i would have trusted him with my wife er my life looks off camera laughing whatd i say
gets serious again i cant say i was surprised though when he disappeared
ragged telephoto shots of the drug rehab center in the desert low innocuous adobe buildings
who was this enigma
a courageous public servant or a debauched addict
either way his last known stop was here
isolated in the arizona desert
taken in by an order of devoted monks
in an arizona town a monk with a clerical collar brother timothy is loading groceries into the back of a pick up
hes being ambush interviewed
hes polite but not cooperative
we dont talk about the people whove been our guests
but i can tell you this about our order we believe everybody has the right to start over
everybody deserves a second chance
shots of wind swept desert cactus and dust blown highway
that is exactly the chance the now sober pilgrim took
on a blustery november day
walking away from the rehab center
never to be heard from again
id like to know if hes alive
if he is i just hope hes happy and his new life is
not sure how to put it well i hope hes found what he was looking for
mumford in his apartment watches with real emotion
his sisters face dissolves into a new snapshot of mumford dressed in an orkin exterminator uniform as the music on the show comes up
a telephone number appears across the bottom of the frame
if you have any information about this man or know anything about his whereabouts contact the sheriffs department in cochise county arizona or call this number
mumford comes out to the rail and looks off over the town of mumford
what he sees or imagines he sees all across the nightscape one window in every house is glowing blue with flickering tv light
moving in on the porch steps
mumford runs into the shot
in fact hes run the whole way from his place and hes out of breath
he takes the porch steps three at a time rings the doorbell and waits
cook peeks out then opens the front door an especially sour look on her face
she speaks through the screen door
well look whos here
good evening mrs
just who is here can you tell me
could i see sofie please
no you can not
i wouldnt know who to say is calling
cook glances inside at the as yet unseen sofie then hisses at mumford i could see right through you from the start you imposter
i know what youre after
i knew it then and i know it now
sofie appears behind her mother
what do you think im after mrs
its so obvious
youre after my daughter
well i gotta say mrs
cook youre right about that
both sofie and mrs
cook are set back for a moment
cook recovers fastest itll never happen
youre in big trouble mister
scary strong mother
cook suddenly appears takes mrs
cook by the arm and makes her vanish
sofie and mumford are left alone
she looks at him through the screen
i guess you saw the show
which show was that
part of it
we were watching er until someone called
you probably got the idea
sofie comes outside
she doesnt get too close or look at him as she walks to the other end of the porch
do you know what a betrayal this is
how violated i feel
youre not the only one
sofie turns sharply to look at him ready to blow up
you feel violated
all my other my patients
i smelled tar and feathers on the way over here
you deserve it
he watches her closely
i should be irate
mumford immediately perks up
sofie tries to correct i am irate
grabbing at the thread but
im mad as hell
this is a terrible thing youve done
i know it
please believe me i know that
mumford steps closer to her
but there is one
mitigating factor i want you to consider before you write me off
will you think about it
i dont know
im in a bad mood
i love you
more than ive ever loved anyone or anything in my life
she looks into his eyes
i want to spend the rest of my life with you
but im not sure you feel the same way
she regards him for several moments her mind racing
i sort of do
mumford feels joy
now finally he takes her in his arms
but first you have to tell me something
what is your name
as mumford breaks into a huge grin cut to mumford is at the defense table
lionel is his lawyer
cook and ben sit right behind the rail
the defendant will rise
mumford and lionel stand up
sit down lionel
lionel sits down squelched again
we see judge otto for the first time a tough guy in his sixties
clarence norman white do you understand how serious are the crimes with which you have been charged
do you realize how insidious it is to invade the most private thoughts and secret lives of unsuspecting people
we see theres a pretty big turnout for this hearing
prominent among the onlookers lily and skip sitting together nessa and martin holding hands dr
delbanco and mrs
gilroy from the state certification board sits with the prosecutor
people who have come to you with the faith that you know what youre doing
and that you are who you say you are
yes your honor
it means absolutely nothing to me that so many of your patients have come forward with praise for you and your therapeutic skills
you understand that
follett is sitting in one of the back rows apparently alone
but now he looks down the row
althea is sitting down at the end in a stylish suit completely appropriate but a size too small
she gives follett a sidelong glance then crosses her legs provocatively
whatever fantasy theyre currently enacting is working really well for both of them
white i am frustrated that the criminal code in this state allows a maximum sentence of only six months and a maximum fine of only
im sorry your honor
im sorry youre frustrated
are you disrespecting this court mr
i was empathizing
maybe you can empathize with this maximum fine
three months in jail three months house arrest
sentence to begin immediately at the orchard valley correctional facility
this court is adjourned
the judge slams down his gavel stands up and stalks out
a deputy moves in to take custody of mumford
lionel stands up and leans in its a country club
dont worry about it
thanks for your help lionel
mumford turns to face the cooks
cook and ben shake his hand like hes just won something
lionel addresses them all with his usual self satisfaction ill have him out in half the time
we push in on mumford and sofie who embrace
you got off easy
will you wait for me
were only talking about six weeks
will you be here
i havent got the energy to get out of town that fast
the deputy takes mumfords arm and we mumford is alone in the backseat handcuffed to a metal restraint
a lone county correctional officer is up front driving
theres a heavy security screen divider between front and back
better make yourself comfortable
we got a three hour drive here
youre the shrink arent you
no not really
but you do therapy
not any more
they ride along in silence
at peace mumford watches the town go by
finally ill tell you doc the wife and i we got a little bit of a problem
would you mind if i just ran it by you
the correctional officer watches mumford in the rear view mirror waiting hopefully
mumford ponders the question a long time then gives a what the hell shrug
the state correctional sedan heads out of the business district toward the highway leaving the town of mumford behind
