b if window
href b b duck soup screenplay by harry ruby bert kalmar and grover jones the story begins with an opening shot on the exterior of the executive mansion
it is a gala day
soldiers are lined up in front of the entrance expensive cars and carriages are arriving and depositing distinguished notables from the adjoining countries
two trumpeters at the head of the stairs announce the arrival of each notable
in the large reception hall mrs
teasdale wife of the late president is greeting the newcomers
the room is filled with distinguished guests
at the moment we see mrs
teasdale she is talking with a notable
in the near background is a group of distinguished men members of her own cabinet
her words to the notable are not lost on them and as she begins to praise the new dictator there is the exchange of disapproving glances
it is so good of you to come
an honor mrs
you must indeed have great faith in your new dictator to give him such a magnificent reception
i feel that rufus t
firefly is the only logical successor to my dear departed husband
he has the statesmanship of gladstone the humility of lincoln and the wisdom of pericles
the notable kisses her hand once more and leaves the scene
as he does the background group moves into mrs
their spokesman addresses mrs
teasdale as members of freedonias cabinet we do not approve of your choice
who is this rufus t
waving aloft a paper a stranger in our midst an agent for the eureka ammunition company
think of it gentlemen an ammunition salesman dictating the policies of our peace loving country
teasdale before it is too late
the citizens of freedonia want a president
as the widow of your last president i have the right to choose and gentlemen i refuse to discuss the matter any further
mrs teasdale turns her back on them leaving them to mumble among themselves
from off scene comes a servants voice announcing his excellency ambassador verdi trentino of amnesia
to the archway
we see trentino enter with a beautiful brunette at his side
he is followed by two or three of his fellowmen
he moves across the reception hall to mrs
teasdale bows most graciously and presses his lips to the back of her hand then introduces his companion
my niece vera
teasdale shakes the girls hand warmly
to niece your uncle has been such a friend to us in every crisis
without his countrys financial aid lightly what is money
teasdale for you i would do anything
attempting to change the subject i am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator
persistent in his flattery mrs
teasdale no matter who rules freedonia to me you will always be the first lady of the land
trentino attempts to take her hand
the latter is a bit confused much to the amusement of vera who laughingly says mrs
teasdale my uncles hopeless youve been the only topic of conversation ever since we left amnesia
teasdales confusion is happily interrupted by the announcement of a servant off scene
the honorable mohamed pandooh of mufhtan
hastily oh i must greet his honor
teasdale exits from the scene quickly
vera and trentino look after her then vera laughs softly as their eyes meet
so thats the one you want to marry
teasdale as my wife and freedonia under my control he rubs his hands significantly maybe its not going to be so easy
from what ive heard mrs
teasdale is rather sweet on this rufus t
thats where you come in
ill leave him in your hands and dont forget youre supposed to be my niece
vera winks agreeingly
teasdale enters the scene with bob firefly zeppo
she introduces him
i want you to meet the son of his excellency bob firefly
his niece vera after the formalities of introducing trentino says isnt it about time for the ceremony to begin mrs
mockingly i do hope his excellency wont be late
defensively my father makes it a point to always be on time
as long as ive known him hes never been late for an appointment
but its two minutes of ten now
as music begins his excellency is due to take his station
beginning his new administration
hell make his appearance when the clock on the wall strikes ten
singing when the clock on the wall strikes ten all you loyal ladies and you patriotic men lets sing the national anthem when
the clock on the wall strikes ten
the clock begins to strike the hour
singing hail hail freedonia
mightiest of mighty nations
hail hail freedonia land of the brave and free
this finishes on an operatic note with everybody with outstretched hands turned toward the main door that connects the reception hall with the outer hall
groucho doesnt appear and once more they all sing
singing hail hail freedonia
land of the brave and free
again groucho fails to appear and they all sing once more
hail hail freedonia
land of the brave and free
teasdale exchanges an apprehensive glance with bob
vera and trentino smile
nervously i hope nothing has happened
teasdale i assure you there is nothing to worry about
father is probably taking extra care in getting into his robes of state
ill call him
bob goes over to a corner of the room and pulls a tapestried bell cord
this rings a fire bell in grouchos room and groucho is disclosed asleep in his canopied bed under a mosquito netting
he has an unlighted cigar in his mouth
the continued jangling of the fire bell awakens him from his slumber and he rises quickly
the cigar begins to emit smoke when he starts puffing
he hurries over to one corner of the room where his clothes are arranged in fireman fashion gets into them and then sides down a firemans pole into the reception
the guests are singing the last two lines of the national anthem when he arrives
hail hail freedonia
land of the brave and free
groucho starts across the hall in the direction of mrs
he passes several notables one of whom is wearing an impressive looking medal
groucho deprives him of it without stopping his forward movement and pins it on himself
he pauses only when he is facing the principal group
beaming as she addresses groucho as chairwoman of the reception committee i welcome you and extend the good wishes of every man woman and child of freedonia
i deem it an honor on this momentous occasion
interrupting never mind that stuff
he takes a pack of cards from is pocket and extends them to mrs

groucho puts the other fifty one cards in his pocket

groucho dances as above is sung singing if any man should come between a husband and his bride we find out which one she prefers by letting her decide
if she prefers the other man the husband steps outside we stand him up against the wall and pop goes the weasel
singing the husband steps outside relinquishes his bride we stand him up against the wall and take him for a ride
groucho dances as above is sung the population must increase with great rapidity
we give a couple seven years to raise a family
if by that time there is no branch upon the family tree we stand em up against the wall and pop goes the weasel
groucho does a dance with mrs
teasdale who joins him reluctantly and registers embarrassment as dance continues
he might finish dance in her arms looking tenderly at her as she beams down at him
as she beams on him youve made a wonderful impression
your views are liberal
it is easy to see you have an open mind
thats what i get for dressing in a hurry
your excellency you mustnt forget your appointment at the house of representatives
have you got your speech ready
i wrote a speech last night thatll knock them off their seats
he takes a paper from inside pocket as he says above
then reads from paper four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation why thats the speech that lincoln made at gettysburg
with a look of great surprise he did
i told my son not to leave it laying around
where is son
bob enters here i am father
send for my car
calling to servant off scene his excellencys car
this is repeated by a servants voice off scene
a servant enters to groucho bearing his high silk hat
he bows low as he hands it to groucho
groucho takes hat removes a white rabbit hands it back to servant dons his hat and with a swanky gesture exits
again we hear a servants voice calling his excellencys car
we see the trumpeters at the top of the steps of the mansion outside standing at attention
their trumpets at their sides
from inside comes the voice of a servant calling his excellencys car
the trumpeters click their heels draw themselves erect put the trumpets to their mouths and blow a fanfare to summon the car
we cut to the exterior of the dictators garage
this is a pretentious affair
in central foreground a wall in the center of which is a large wrought iron double gate
on each side of the gate is a crest or design in relief
also two liveried guards stand erect before the gate
a trumpeter on the wall above
through the gate we see the patio and suggestions of the garage
two or three high class cars in background identify the garage
at the beginning of the scene we hear finish of trumpeters call
instantly the two guards move to the center of the gates and call through the bars in unison his excellencys car
almost instantly there is a terrific roar of motors on the other side of the wall
the two guards open gates moving in military manner
immediately the gates are wide open harpo appears on his motorcycle that carries a side car
the motorcycle is decorated
perhaps a crest in relief on the side of the car
a thin staff about four or five feet high is fastened to the handle bars
as harpo rides along he hoists the freedonian flag to the staff
further along the road he hits a man
he looks behind to see what damage hes done but continues riding
a cut back to the man shows that he is lying prostrate on the ground
we cut back to harpo who is just getting off motorcycle
he takes another look back at the man lowers the flag to half mast takes bugle which is hanging on his car and blows a few bars of taps
he mounts motorcycle again and starts off
cut to top of mansion steps as groucho comes from mansion
the two guards standing stiffly erect form a seat by crossing hands
groucho sits on the seat made by their hands puts his arms around their shoulders and they carry him down stairs
as fast as they can
cut to harpo arriving in front of mansion just as groucho carried by the men moves into the scene
groucho gets into the side car
and in napoleonic manner says to harpo to the house of representatives
ride like fury
dont stop for any signals and dont wait for a corner to make a turn
see if you can break a record
harpo takes a phonograph record and smashes it on the ground
there is a roar of the motor the motorcycle starts off but leaves the side car
groucho gets out of side car
starts back to steps stops and says a fine thing leaving the head of the nation at the foot of the stairs
as he dashes up the stairs we cut to harpo
a very attractive girl is coming along in the opposite direction
as she approaches harpo he toots his horn to attract her attention she throws him a indignant look and continues on down the street
harpo turns his motorcycle around and starts after her
she looks around sees harpo pursuing and breaks into a run
cut back to harpo following her putting on speed
he lowers the freedonian flag and simultaneously raises a pirate flag with skull and cross bones on it displayed prominently
a motorcycle cop is parked on the corner waiting for prospective violators
he sees harpo chasing the girl and quickly starts his motor and follows in pursuit
the girl as she reaches the executive mansion rushes up the stairs in an effort to escape
harpo comes into the scene and rides up the stairs after her
as harpo gets about half way up the stairs the motorcycle cop is seen approaching the mansion
cut to reception room of mansion as the girl is running madly through the room
a moment later we see harpo on his bike following
there is panic among the guests
then we see the girl tearing up the stairs leading to the circular balcony
cut back to harpo
he looks behind him as he rides and sees the motorcycle cop following on his bike
on the balcony above the girl is running with an occasional glance over her shoulder as she runs out of scene
harpo rides into scene
this time he is bent over his handle bars in the manner of a six day bicycle rider
following closely behind him rides the motorcycle cop
they circle the mezzanine
harpo in the lead looking back now and then over his shoulder at his pursuer
this is done in imitation of a six day bicycle race
the motorcycle cop is closing in on harpo
the latter approaching a large open door rides through the opening but the cop continues on around the balcony
as he gets to the opposite side of the circular balcony he passes another open doorway
harpo comes riding out of it and is now in pursuit of the cop
cut down stairs to groucho
one hand is upraised holding a gun
as he looks at a wrist watch he fires gun then addresses guests looking into camera
that concludes the nine oclock sprints
next saturday night the winner of the six day bicycle race will receive ten thousand dollars in gold
the following morning we go off the gold standard
cut back to balcony
harpo is passing the cop
he holds up his hand for the cop to stop
they both come to a halt
harpo gets off his motorcycle walks over angrily to cop takes out his book writes out a summons and hands it to the cop as we fade out
fade in on interior of freedonian house of representatives
this interior although not a replica of our own house of representatives should be close enough technically to sell the idea
each seat is occupied by an officious looking dignitary
on the platform are a few desks
perhaps a pulpit which groucho uses when he arrives
the one to the right is the court stenographers desk occupied by bob firefly
he takes notes as the meeting progresses
throughout the house runs a ripple of excitement which is stopped by the rapping of the gavel by the speaker of the house
gentlemen gentlemen remember for forty six years we have enjoyed the friendship of amnesia so ably represented by ambassador trentino
indicating the ambassador who is present we owe it to ourselves to listen to what he has to say
trentino takes the floor gentlemen while i admit it is unusual for a representative of one country to advise the legislative body of another i assure you that i have
the interest of freedonia at heart deferential applause we have lent you money in the past we are willing to lend you money again but we cannot do it if your leader is allowed by you to carry out his ridiculous proposals
in self protection it is my bob rises to interrupt i object
we have no right to discuss this matter in the absence of my father
to house we have been meeting every morning for eight days and not once has his excellency been on time
looking at his watch gentlemen i cannot wait much longer
to bob would you mind calling your father again
bob presses a button either on desk or wall
cut to the corner of grouchos bedroom showing firemans pole
the sound of the clanging bell is heard over scene
groucho hurries into scene fully clad but for his coat which he has on his arm
without waiting to don his coat he slides down the pole
we pick him up finishing the slide down the pole into the house of representatives
as he arrives the members are on their feet singing the last four bars of the national anthem
singing hail hail freedonia land of the brave and free
groucho hurries toward speakers desk putting on his coat as he goes
just as he reaches the desk the singing subsides
groucho turns to the body of men and looks off in the direction of one of the representatives
pointing toward the individual off scene the secretary of agriculture was a little flat
he takes a match and scratches it across the top of the desk to light his cigar
takes a few puffs then raps the gavel
i move we open the morning session
has anybody got a cork screw
looking out and around at members page missing whats to stop you from digging one
and after you dig a river howre ya gonna cross it without a bridge
weve got to have a bridge to stop people from going places then weve gotta stop them from coming back
if youre worried about the expense we can have a bridge with only one end and if thats a success we can do away with it altogether
im telling you that what this country needs is off scene we hear chicos voice singing p e a n u t s
this is followed by the piping of a whistle playing the first strain of the peanut vendor
groucho listens annoyed and then continues if theres one thing we dont need right now its peanuts gentlemen what good is a bridge if you havent got ammunition to blow
ammunition was never cheaper
right now you can get two cannons for the price of one and shoot twice as far for half the money
with every five thousand dollar purchase we throw in a big bertha
if you dont like her you can throw her right out again
i tell you no country can protect itself without again chicos voice comes over scene singing p e a n u t s
the whistling of the first strain of song the peanut vendor is heard again im sorry your excellency it is that infernal peanut vendor chicolini
how can we accomplish anything with that constant annoyance
your excellency are we or are we not going to discuss this problem my time is valuable im a man of few words im a man of one word
trentino exits resentfully to bob aroused go out and chase that peanut vendor away from the building get rid of him if you have to use violence if necessary call
out the militia and if he isnt looking get me a bag of peanuts
ive tried to chase him but its no use he wont go he wont eh
well see about that send for your father immediately

displayed singing loudly close up of whistle piping tune of peanut vendor trentino enters to chico to trentino howm i doing boss

hes working very hard i got him a job driving fireflys car hes a driving him crazy and im driving him nuts p e a n u t s singing
even louder than before trentino smirks approvingly and exits the whistling of the tune following as we cut inside to groucho and the well known vamp of the peanut vendor is heard coming over scene with orchestra accompaniment
glaring angrily at window ill get rid of that pest watch me he walks determinedly in direction of window and breaks into a rhumba with hands on hips dipping to
ground a la spanish dancer
as he reaches window we cut outside
groucho is seen in the window which is on the ground floor chico is by his peanut stand
to chico angrily hey you

i dont want him
well if you dont want your dog why dont you put him in a pound
he only weighs ten ounces i can use you in the house of representatives
we need a man who understands dogs and thats where this country is going to
groucho turns and disappears from the window cut inside of house of representatives to bob in case of fire how long will it take to empty this place
after a moments thought about thirty four seconds
well start a fire indicating representatives and get rid of these microbes
groucho exits towards door leading into his private office
cut to inside of private office which has another door leading to a hallway and among other articles of furniture there is an impressive looking desk on which is a
just as groucho comes through the door into his office chico enters through the other door
he is wearing gauntlets reaching half way up his arms
as they walk toward each other the telephone rings and the two men make a mad dash for the telephone on the desk
chico beats groucho to the phone picks up the receiver
at telephone hello

chico hangs up receiver and turns to groucho who is waiting impatiently that was for you

the two men turn and run for the telephone

groucho stands by exasperated while chico talks to the party on the other end of the line to telephone hello

he wants you to call him up as soon as you get back

telephone bell rings
they both make a dash for the telephone but harpo rushes in through hallway door and reaches the phone first
harpo picks up through telephone receiver listens to conversation on the other end with an occasional nod and shake of the head
as he listens he scribbles message on a piece of paper
he holds the written message up to the telephone receiver for a moment then writes a few more words on the paper
during this chico and groucho stand by terribly worried
finally harpo hangs up the receiver and exits tearing up the paper after a moments glance at harpo you know id be lost without a telephone
now where were we
oh yes i just made you secretary of war
the first thing you do is buy ammunition you buy it from me and i get commission
what do i get

i dont want to buy ammunition we no gotta war

groucho suddenly slaps chico across the face with his gloves then as quickly brings to light a card which he presents to chico in the professional manner of an experienced
duelist my card
laughing thats a no good
you gotta insult somebody from another country
look puts his large gloves on the desk i come from one country

enthusiastically ambassador trentino
how about him
hes a very easy to insult i say something to his niece once and he slapped my face
why didnt his niece slap your face

chico whispers in grouchos ear groucho gives him an indignant look youre lucky i dont slap your face you oughtta be ashamed of yourself
where did you hear that story
you told it to me
puzzled for a moment oh yes i remember and i should have slapped mrs
teasdales face when she told it to me
im going right out and find trentino
you go right out and get yourself an army
chico turns to go groucho stops him wait a minute
what kind of an army do you think we oughtta have
i think we oughtta have a standing army so we can save money on chairs
at this point chico is at the door and exits groucho slams the door right in his face then he walks over to the desk and sees the larger gauntlets
he takes a swing with his own gloves then takes a hefty swing with the gauntlet
he leaves his own gloves on the desk and exits with the gauntlets in is hand
harpo is just pulling up to the curb in front of the house of representatives in his motorcycle and side car
groucho comes from the building wearing gauntlets gets into the side car and with a dignified wave of his hand says to mrs
the motorcycle speeds out of the scene leaving the side car behind
this is the fifth trip ive made today and i havent been anywhere yet
and as he gets out of the side car and starts to go back into the building the scene fade in to garden party
this is an afternoon tea in the garden of the teasdale estate
spotted in the set up are innumerable colorful umbrellas under which are tea tables
the guests include the notables we saw in the mansion in the first sequence
the only two people absent are ambassador trentino and mrs
vera trentino is seated at one of the tables and her presence is established there in the opening shot
music is heard over the scene and should be continued through the scene as if being played by an orchestra on the premises
suddenly the chatter ceases as the following announcement is heard coming over scene
from off scene his excellency rufus t
all eyes turn toward those off scene and everyone rises to sing the last four bars of the national anthem
cut to the gateway leading into the garden
a servant on each side of the gate as groucho jauntily strides through the gate swinging the unusually large gauntlets
singing hail hail freedonia land of the brave and free
groucho hands his high silk hat to one of the guards and starts down the walk among the guests
from his attitude it is evident that he is intent on finding ambassador trentino
suddenly he stops having seen something of interest off scene
the following dialogue comes over the scene
cant you see gloria our marriage would not only unite two great families
cut to trentino and mrs
teasdale in a quiet corner of the garden both are at a tea table
this shot leaves groucho out
continuing but would further cement the relations of our countries
fluttering with excitement ambassador trentino i am indeed honored
falteringly but you see well i repressing his anger coldly oh
then there his somebody else
well no not exactly but impatiently gloria ive waited for years
i wont be put off
i love you
i want you
taking her hand pleadingly cant you see that im at your feet
groucho enters the scene
to trentino when you get through with her feet you can start on mine
i havent been to a chiropodist in two years
to camera if thats not an insult i dont know what is
turns to gloria gloria i love you
i furious to gloria cant we go some place where we can be alone
teasdale what can this mug offer you
wealth and family
i cant give you wealth
archly lifting his eyebrow but we can have a little family of our own
coyly oh rufus
all i can offer you is a rufus over your head
happily confused oh your excellency i dont know what to say
i wouldnt know what to say either if i was in your place
turning to trentino maybe you can suggest something
hotly this has gone far enough
this interruption is humiliating to say the least
well why not say the least and get it over with
half addressing mrs
teasdale i didnt come here to be insulted
thats what you think
furiously you swine
give me that again
holds his gauntlets in his hand ready at any moment to strike you upstart
no man lives who can call a firefly an upstart
without further ado groucho strikes trentino across the face with his gauntlets
then he quickly flashes his card and extends it to trentino in the manner of a duelist
as he offers the card touche
a sudden ripple of excitement as the guests attracted by the rumpus begin to move into the scene
prominent among these is vera trentino
trentino refuses grouchos card white with rage
coldly i shall report this indignity the my president
teasdale polite but firm mrs

she winks at trentino i will stay here in freedonia
as a faint smile of understanding vanishes from his face very well then if thats how you feel about it suggestive shrug of his shoulders my country has spoken
he turns on his heel as if about to leave
groucho stops him then its war
howre ya fixed for ammunition
waves groucho aside and exits dramatically sound of trumpet ta ta ta ta sound of trumpet ta ta ta ta sound of trumpet ta ta ta ta sound of trumpet
ta ta ta ta the above lies are spoken in meter and each line is punctuated by the staccato notes of the trumpet
groucho makes a military exit from scene in time to the music which goes into a military march
as groucho reaches the gate the guard hands him his high silk hat
groucho takes the hat removes a white rabbit from it hands it to the guard as he exits through gate
insert of newspaper
the newspaper moves up to camera from background as it stops we read the following headlines through this insert we get the vague impression of war activity
we see the movement of soldiers feet
from the background the second insert moves up to camera
the first insert moves past camera and the second insert comes from the background
the headline reads through this insert we see the heavy wheels of army wagons moving along
this is replaced by the the insert coming from the background
the headlines read bombing planes move through this insert
the front page of the paper is turned and followed by a few other pages until we come to the classified ad section of the paper
we see the following advertisement wanted a female spy
must be young and attractive apply to office of secretary of war
above this ad we just see a few lines of another ad wanted a chauffeur below the war nurse ad we see part of another ad in which a cook
a shot in movement of a row of shapely legs obviously those of very pretty girls
the camera moves upward disclosing the faces of the girls who are sitting in a row in the ante room of the secretary of wars office
on the door leading to the secretarys private office we see the lettering private
the camera discloses only four or five of these girls but we know there are more in the room
bob appears in the doorway leading to the secretarys office and addresses the first girl nearest the door
the secretary of war will see you next miss
this girl is very pretty and has a very attractive form
she smiles at bob rises and exits into the secretarys office
bob closes the door behind her
the camera now moves along the row of girls and the sixth or seventh girl in the row is harpo dressed as a girl
on the other side of him are more girls
a girl to the right of him turns to the girl beside her
to the girl at her right did you hear the one about the woman taking a bath
well she forgot to lock the door
a man came in and said im a doctor
the woman said im not sick
and the man said thats all right
im not a doctor
all of the girls laugh heartily at at this remark
harpo is laughing also
he slaps the story teller on the leg
her laughter ceases instantly
she slaps him back and gets another slap on the leg in return
a little squeal of pain from her and she raises her dress disclosing a bruise on her leg just above the knee
to harpo look
harpo does so then pulls up his own dress and points to his leg for her to look
on his leg is tattooed a picture of two hearts entwined with an arrow running through both
she gives harpo dirty look and rises private office of secretary of war
the office is cluttered with war implements maps etc
the examination of the girl is in progress
she is turning around in the manner of a clothes model
chico is looking her over
to girl you look pretty good to me but very still need a spy have you got any credentials
the girl nods and pulls her dress up above her knees revealing an attractive leg
she reaches into her stocking for a paper
taking a very good look you got credentials all right
the girl drops her skirt and hands the paper to chico
chico looks at the paper this is fine
put it back
hands the girl the paper
she lifts her dress above her knees again and puts the paper back in her stocking while chico looks on
she drops her skirt
i think i better take another look at that paper
she lifts the skirt again to get the paper while chico steals another glance
the girl drops her skirt and hands him the paper
looking at the paper i look this over later now i look you over
if you want to be a spy you gotta be in good condition
i better examine you
he takes stethoscope from his pocket applies it to her heart and listens
listening to girls heart beat theres something wrong i think im getting whitemans band
puts stethoscope back in his pocket and takes watch from vest pocket
he feels her pulse while looking at the watch
according to my watch its four oclock
puts watch back in his pocket now look a woman spy is a gotta make love to men
come on lets see you make love
she walks over to him and lovingly strokes his hair puts both arms around him then suddenly becomes very amorous bends him over and kisses him madly
she lets go after a little while and chico comes up for air
he staggers around in a daze
then he takes the watch from his vest pocket hands it to her extends his wrist and says now you feel my pulse
suddenly the screaming of girls is heard coming from the anteroom and we cut to the anteroom in the midst of confusion
the girls are running helter skelter one or two of them are standing on chairs with their skirts lifted above their knees
there is a little white mouse running about the room
harpo is sitting innocently on the bench
the girl just interviewed by chico comes from the office sees the mouse screams and joins in the general confusion
groucho enters as the girls are running about zig zags among them and continues through the room into the private office of chico closing door behind him
the girls clear out of anteroom and harpo is left all alone
he takes a small mouse trap from his large pocketbook puts it on the floor crouches down and whistles to the mouse in the manner of a man trying to
call a dog
the mouse in answer to the whistle runs into the trap
the secretary of wars office
chico at the phone
to phone send in the next girl
he hangs receiver up by the way are you sure we need a spy
sure we gotta have a spy
if we no got a spy whos gonna tell the other side what were doing
at this point harpo makes his entrance through the door carrying his unusually large pocketbook which is about the size of a carpetbag
he walks past groucho in a seductive manner swinging his bag and rolling his eyes flirtatiously
groucho is delighted with this action and returns the ogling
to harpo have you got any credentials
harpo lifts his dress and shows them the tattoo on his leg of the two hearts
groucho examines it closely
i dont go in much for modern art
have you got anything by one of the old masters
harpo lifts his dress above the other leg and shows a picture of gainsboroughs blue boy
chico and groucho arise from the examination
im glad i didnt ask you for washington crossing the delaware
to harpo weve gotta have somebody who knows how to get secrets from men
you know how to make love
harpo walks over to chico throws his arms around him and starts to give him a big hug
he squeezes him very hard
in the midst of this there is a loud report
a startled look from groucho and chico
we see that harpo is minus one breast
he tries to affect an innocent look when suddenly there is a second loud report and his breasts are now as flat as a billiard table
just as he turns to hide the sight from chico and groucho a hissing sound is heard the air is leaking out of his bustle and the bustle is becoming
to harpo you ought to carry a spare
harpo goes to a corner of the room and keeps his back to camera
he takes a tube out of his dress front and begins to blow
chico and groucho wear a puzzled look as they watch him the bustle starts to expand
this inflation continues to gigantic proportions as they look on
looking at harpo were certainly living in a marvelous age
there is a terrific explosion and all of harpos clothes are blown off him leaving him in nothing but running pants and ladies silk stockings
his body is literally covered with tattoos
laughing thats very funny
he certainly fooled me
hell make a good spy
winks significantly at harpo
harpo returns the wink
examining tattoos if we cant use him as a spy we can have him framed
he and chico continue further examination of the tattooed designs on harpos body
say thats a nice collection
you oughta have a catalogue
harpo pulls a catalogue from under the belt of his trunks and hands it to chico
groucho and chico look at the catalogue
lets take a look at number eighteen
harpo reveals more of his back and shows a superb tattooed job of a beautiful girls head
referring to picture of girl say shes all right
you got a her phone number
harpo raises one arm and shows the phone number tattooed right under the arm pit
he holds this a moment then turns and discloses a portion of the tattooing on his chest
groucho and chicos eyes shift from the telephone number to the tattooed picture on his chest
harpo completes move and discloses the entire picture
it is a country back house with a crescent over the door
chico laughs uproariously
laughing thats a funny one
he slaps harpo an the back good naturedly
trick shot on harpos chest
the door in the outhouse flies open
the head of a real man appears in the opening
he looks off in the direction of chico and mumbles incoherencies under his breath
he is terribly angry at being interrupted
he draws in his head closing the door behind him
to harpo i think we can use you
heres a spy glass
go ahead and do some spying
harpo takes the glasses and goes directly toward the window
as he looks across street through binoculars he is grinning all over and wiggling around like a happy kid
looking into the open window of a bedroom as harpo would see it through the binoculars
a beautiful girl is undressing preparing to retire
after a moment of this shot cut back to harpo looking through the binoculars
chico takes the binoculars from harpo and pushes him out of the scene proceeds to look himself
he registers the same satisfaction as harpo and hands the binoculars to groucho
as groucho looks through the binoculars at the beautiful girl chico says hes going to make a good spy
thats not bad for the first day
turning and looking at chico thats not bad for any day
groucho takes a second look through the binoculars at the beautiful girl
this time he sees harpo chasing the girl around the roam
this is shot through the binoculars as before
groucho registers amazement as he looks through binoculars perhaps squints his eyes once or twice and takes second look
to chico maybe my eyes are bad you take a look
chico takes the binoculars and looks at the room across the street
binocular shot as before
the girl is in her underwear tearing out of the room into the hall pursued by harpo
chico is still looking through the binoculars
youre right about that guy i think weve got something
i dont know about us but i know hes a got something

during the dance groucho tries to get the paper
he bends her way over in an effort to make the paper drop out of her bodice
harpo and chico watching the struggle quickly tear off their capes and coats and leap from the box on to stage in their shirts
this develops into a four cornered adagio dance
she hands the papers to harpo over grouchos shoulder as she dances with him
groucho rushes to harpo and they do a twirl together
harpo hands the paper to chico over grouchos shoulder

fade in mrs
teasdales living room
we begin with an extreme close close shot of a hand depositing the plans of war in a vault
this vault is about the height of a man the door flush with wall
the camera trucks back and discloses that the one depositing the papers is mrs
teasdale she is in negligee
she closes the vault door pulls a cord closing a pair of drapes which hide the vault
the camera pans to the balcony above where vera trentino also in negligee is watching the action in the living room below

teasdale turns out the center table light and moves toward the stairway
cut to vera trentinos bedroom
vera comes toward window raises it quietly and waves a handkerchief evidently signalling somebody below

cut to inside
they are walking cautiously across the room when they hear the following coming over scene psst
they stop and look around trying to locate the source of the sound
we cut to the balcony and see vera trentino still dressed in her negligee
once more she tries to attract them
the boys look up and see her
in a half whisper mysteriously in the safe behind the drapes pointing in the direction of the safe also in a half whisper all right ill meet you behind the
in a half whisper no no i mean the plans are in the safe
pointing to safe again harpo hasnt taken his eyes off of vera during all this makes a sudden dash for her as she turns to her room
chico stops him on the second or third step of the stairs
come on we gotta no time for that
chico goes over to the safe and draws the curtains disclosing safe
harpo follows and takes from his back pocket a rather large electrical drill with a cord and plug attached to it
chico takes the cord and plugs it into the wall socket
harpo starts to drill the safe door making a terrific noise the usual reaping whir r r of an electric drill
chico grabs his hand and stops him from drilling
wait a minute
we make too much noise
turn on the radio so they cant hear what were doing
harpo goes over to radio and turns it on
a dance tune comes over the air
harpo grabs chico and whirls him around as if he were dancing with a dame
jerking himself away from harpo whats a matter you crazy
chico goes to radio and adjusts dial to another station
the following comes over the air
go to vacant lot at tenth and elm
a woman walking around in her nightgown harpo drops the drill and makes a wild dash for door obviously to go to the woman
chico stops him

cut to veras bedroom
it is a close shot showing vera in bed shot from side of bed
she is under the bedcovers desperately trying to keep them from being pulled off her
truck back disclosing harpo on the other end of the bedcovers trying to pull them off her
for a moment following a tug of war goes on harpo pulling the covers about a foot his way and vera pulling them back
the sound of chicos second whistle coming over scene attracts harpo who lets go of the covers and runs out of the room
we pick him up outside of the room on balcony
without hesitation he slides down the bannisters to join chico who is waiting at foot of stairs
exasperated hey you never get the safe open that way
looking up at veras room we gotta try the combination
you gotta the combination
harpo nods and takes from under his coat a womans silk combination
winks and looks back in the direction of veras room
chico snatches it out of his hand and throws it away
during above mrs
teasdale has come out on balcony sees the boys but cant distinguish them in the room which is practically in darkness except for a few splotches of moonlight
she runs back into her room
cut to mrs
she is at telephone dialing a number
after a slight nervous pause hello

harpo strikes a match but chico stops him from lighting it
wait a minute
we gotta fix it so it dont make a so much noise
what a we do
harpo takes out a large wad of cotton tears it hands two pieces to chico
they both stuff their ears with large pieces
now nobody hear the noise
harpo lights fuse
each stands on either side of safe door waiting for the explosion
after a slight pause there is a terrific blast of sound
and the screen is masked with smoke
the smoke clears away and the safe door falls to the floor
groucho walks out of the safe putting the plans of war in his inside pocket
after a few steps he stops and addresses the boys
that woman is crazy
there are no burglars around here
fade in to insert of newspaper which comes from background to camera
a screaming headline reads this insert goes past the camera as another newspaper comes from the background
the headline reads dissolve to grouchos office
groucho is standing in front of his desk reading a newspaper which is spread over his desk
the headline is the same as in the second insert harpo is standing at the other side of the desk
pounding his desk theyre coming
he recites the following command to harpo ride through every village and town wake every citizen up hill and down tell them the enemy comes from afar with a hey
nonny nonny and a ha cha char camera trucks back disclosing a real horse beside harpo
therell be two lamps in the steeple if theyre coming by land and one lamp if theyre coming by sea
he and harpo go to the window and look out
cut to shot of a steeple with three lighted lamps cut back to groucho and harpo they double crossed me
theyre coming by land and sea be off my lad
with a grand gesture groucho exits out of scene
harpo grips pommel of the saddle with both hands and in his attempt to make a flying mount vaults clear over the horse landing on the other side
he lets down a rope ladder from under the saddle climbs the ladder mounts the horse and starts off
dissolve to close up of harpo riding at breakneck speed
as he looks grimly ahead he reaches down out of scene and brings up a three cornered colonial hat and puts it on his head
dissolve to a moving insert harpo bringing the horse to a stop in front of a farm house
he blows a blast on a regular army bugle
immediately a few old men rush out of the house in their nightgowns carrying guns and into the scene from all directions rush other men answering the call similarly attired
harpo starts his horse and we dissolve to him pulling up to another farm house
this house has a single door on the extreme end of it and a very large french window covering almost the rest of the house
harpo stops and sounds the bugle call
this time there is no answer to his call
he waits a second then turns his horse in the direction of the house and rides through the single door
after a short pause the doors of the french window fly open and the horse runs out pulling a double bed which is on wheels
harpo is standing at the foot of the bed braced against the bedpost holding the reins
there is an old couple man and woman fast asleep in the bed this couple might be the blase gentleman and young wife used by peter arno in his cartoons
after riding a few feet harpo leaps from the bed onto the horses back and rides off leaving the bed and its occupants on the road
dissolve to harpo pulling up to another farm house
he stops sounds his bugle
a very pretty young girl in her night clothes pokes her head out of the second story window
harpo takes a good look at her leaps off his horse and dashes into the house
a moment later he comes out of the house with a feed bag and puts it on the horses head
then he dashes back into the house again
almost instantly he comes tearing out of the house followed by an old geezer in his nightgown who is chasing him with rifle in hand
he fires a few shots dissolve through the shooting of previous scene to stock shot of artillery fire on battle field a profile shot with all the activity of an
actual battle but without an indication of falling men
dissolve from this to interior of grouchos headquarters behind the front a wooden shack
the sound of a distant booming of guns is heard over this scene
on the wall is a large war map with colored thumb tacks indicating the positions of grouchos men and the enemy
groucho in the uniform of a confederate general a robert e
lee make up is studying the war map with a few of his generals
looking at a tack in a distant sector either theres a fly in the room or weve got a soldier in africa
the door flies open and bob in a snappy uniform enters excitedly and breathlessly
he faces groucho with a quick salute and a click of the heels
taking a dispatch from under his belt a dispatch from the front sir
groucho snatches the dispatch from bobs hand tears it open reads it quickly claps his hand to his brow and staggers
the generals crowd about him
solicitously bad news sir
bad news its disastrous
simultaneously what is it
reading from dispatch private moscowitz quits
groucho rushes to radio operator clear all wires
the operator works key the enemy has taken hill throwing twelve hill billies out of work
our front is exposed to the enemy well have to bring up the rear
turning away then turning back to generals and continuing p
have misplaced flag of truce
look in upper lefthand drawer of my bureau
the whining of an approaching shell is heard and a shell about three feet long comes sailing through the open window speeds through the room and tears through the opposite
wall leaving a clean cut hole
groucho rushes to window and closes it
shot of no mans land with shells exploding in all directions
we see a head slowly appearing over the edge of shell hole looking through spy glasses
it is harpo
inside of shell hole
harpo registers that he has seen something of startling interest
he drops the glasses scrambles out of shell hole and runs out of scene
he rushes to his waiting motorcycle without the side car
the staff with the flag flying from it is attached to the handle bars
he leaps onto the motorcycle seat and starts off
a war nurse attracted by the roar of the motorcycle
she looks back sees harpo approaching and breaks into a run
as he closes in on her she jumps into a trench to escape him
harpo rides on a little further to the entrance of the trench and turns in to continue his pursuit
a trucking shot shows only the flag and staff tearing along above the surface with the accompanying roar of the motorcycle which is hidden from view
as it speeds along soldiers are leaping up out of the trenches on every side to avoid being run down
this continues doing a zig zag with abrupt turns
groucho is discovered there alone stropping his sword on a razor strap attached to his desk
goes to time clock on wall puts his workmans card in it and punches it
groucho attracted by the bell of the time clock stops stropping and walks over to chico with sword in hand
late again eh
you havent been on time once since this war started
puts sword in sheath get out there and fight
pointing commandingly in direction of battle field i cant do it
surprised why not
youre the secretary of war arent you
yes but im not working for you any more
im on the other side
like a surprised child is that so
i used to think you were two faced but you cant be or you wouldnt be wearing that one
now lets talk this thing over
groucho sits down at desk and chico pulls up another chair and sits at opposite side of desk facing groucho blowing out a puff of smoke now how many men
you got in your army
well we gotta one hundred thousand men
thats not fair weve only got fifty thousand
thats all right
we let you have twenty five thousand men and we both start even
enthusiastically thats the spirit fifty fifty
seventy five seventy five
well well let that one go
now how many battalions you got
we gotta two battalions and one frenchman
i wish you were still working for me so i could ask you to resign
howre ya fixed for cavalry
ive gotta five thousand men but no horses
thats funny weve got five thousand horses but no men
thats all right our men can ride your horses
not a bad idea
if our horses get tired they can ride your men for a change
chico nods agreeingly now i dont mind letting you have our horses but you must promise to put them through their maneuvers
we have horse maneuvers every morning
at this point an unusually large shell comes crashing from above imbedding itself point down in the floor without exploding
groucho and chico rush over to look at it
looking at shell acme ammunition company eh
how do you expect to win the war with shells that dont go off
now if you were buying your stuff from me you wouldnt have that trouble
eureka ammunition is guaranteed to explode or your money back
let me show you some samples
groucho opens door and yells to some one outside bring in no
harpo enters bent forward tugging at a rope which tightens over his shoulder in the manner of a volga boatman
at the end of the rope is a cannon on two wheels pointing to gun thats our latest number
our sixteen inch horowitz gun
to harpo load it up
harpo pours a great quantity of powder into the cannon then to make sure he has enough he lights a match and looks into the hole
groucho takes the lighted match from harpo
he lights his own cigar hands the match back to harpo
harpo pours in a little more powder makes sure he has enough then proceeds to ram the powder in the barrel with his horn
he rises and moves to wall toward which the cannon is pointed
he draws a target on the wall with a piece of chalk goes back to cannon
he picks up the firing string and faces the target toward which the cannon is pointing
chico puts his fingers into his ears
groucho picks up a pencil from desk taps it on desk then raises both hands in the manner of an orchestra leader
he holds this pose for a second and on the down beat harpo jerks the string and there is a terrific explosion
the cannon fires out the back end instead of the front and blows a hole through the back wall
the two stare off in the direction of the hole
groucho turns to chico
with a gun like that you can kill some of your own men
thats a pretty good
ill take a dozen of them
writing order on pad mentally figuring yes one gross of bullets two dozen hand grenades three kegs of powder and throw in some matches
well throw in the matches before we make the delivery
by the way howre you fixed for spys
we gotta him
he indicates harpo so
hes on your side too
well with you two fellows on the other side this country should have no trouble keeping the wolf from the door
harpo opens the door and discloses a dozen or more snarling wolves at the door
cut to interior enemy headquarters
the booming of distant guns comes over the scene
trentino is there with a sylvanian general
something must be done immediately
the soldiers are getting discouraged
theres only one thing to do
we must capture firefly
its a very dangerous undertaking
standing near widow ask for volunteers
some one must make the sacrifice someone stops to gaze out of window attracted by off scene roar of motor here comes chicolini

trentino rushes over to him chicolini youve come just in time

interior of grouchos headquarters
groucho is on his feet addressing five or six generals who are seated
zeppo is at the desk writing the minutes of the meeting
boys i hate to do this but if you generals want this war to continue youll have to take a cut bursting of a shell is heard right outside of
groucho rushes to the window opens it fires a shot from his revolver through the window hurriedly shuts it then rushes back to generals we cant afford to pay the
money weve been paying
now i dont want to lay anybody off
my motto in this war is live and let live
the bursting of another shell is heard right outside of shack
groucho rushes to the window opens it turns his back to window takes out a pocket mirror holds it up in front of him and shoots over his shoulder out
of window taking his aim from the reflection in the mirror like a trick marksman
as groucho walks away from window he hears another explosion outside
he rushes back to the window takes a package of small firecrackers out of his pocket detaches one of the firecrackers lights it from his cigar and throws it out
of the window
a very small explosion is heard
groucho hurriedly shuts the window and rushes back to the generals as we cut to the outside a long shot of a dirigible miniature then we go to a close
up of the dirigible
on the bag in large letters is printed the camera pans down to the cabin of the dirigible
chico and harpo are standing at the open door looking down
thats a fireflys headquarters
pointing down we catch him right now
harpo reaches back into the cabin picks up an enormous hook and throws it out
the rope that is attached to the hook starts playing out rapidly
long shot miniature of dirigible and rope dangling from it
then cut to shot of rope and hook as it approaches grouchos headquarters
it hooks onto the roof of the shack and raises it off the ground
cut to long shot miniature of dirigible carrying the shack through the air
cut to inside of headquarters
to generals gentlemen the overhead is killing us
everything is going up
if we dont watch ourselves well come down with a crash
now all those in favor of taking a cut say aye
protesting but your excellency
cut to shot of dirigible carrying the shack
the shack just clears a steeple by a few inches
cut to inside of headquarters
now go right out there and fight
to one general you go out there and relieve general beauregard and while youre at it see what general motors is doing
the general without saluting exits out of door and closes door behind him
to another general call him back he didnt salute me
the second general exits out of door without saluting closing door behind him
father he didnt salute you either
the remaining generals jump to their feet stand at attention and salute
go out there all of you and bring those generals back dead or alive
all of the generals exit through to door the last one closing door behind him
why dont those generals come back
ill call them
never mind ill go after them myself
groucho goes to door pulls it open starts out cut to exterior of shack against sky backing
groucho is seen in the open doorway
he comes out and walks down the steps there are three steps attached to entrance of door with railing on each side
groucho is about to step off into space
he grabs the railing and hangs by his hands
zeppo rushes to door and pulls him up by the hands
cut to inside as zeppo finishes pulling groucho in
groucho scrambles to his feet rushes to window leans out of window backwards and looks up
cut to shot of dirigible as seen by groucho
cut back inside of shack as groucho pulls in his head
get my rifle
zeppo runs for rifle
ill get rid of them
zeppo returns and hands rifle to groucho
groucho leans out of the window backwards and shoots up into the air
cut to dirigible miniature as the bag explodes
the smoke fills the screen
as the smoke clears away we see groucho and zeppo descending side by side in two parachutes against sky background
to zeppo take a letter
zeppo takes out pad and pencil to whom
to whom it may concern
dear gloria the air has done me a world of good
i am five thousand feet above sea level speeding home to you
can you arrange to meet me at twenty five hundred feet
which is only asking you to meet me half way
dont be surprised if i drop in on you any minute
your fun loving dictator
groucho and zeppo descend out of scene as harpo and chico come into scene from above both suspended from the ropes of their parachutes
they are in a sitting position with a board across their knees playing cards
fade in to a group of notables standing around a large table
among them are mrs
teasdale and zeppo
groucho is the guest of honor very gaily attired for the occasion
as we fade into this scene they are singing singing hail hail freedonia
land of the brave and free
my dad is much too great for his position without a question
id like to offer this with your permission as a suggestion i really think he should be king
we really think he should be king
i really think he should be king
he should be king
and wear a crown and everything
i really think he should be king
he should be king
from what i have been gathering i think they think i should be king i think they think i should be king
he should be king
and wear a crown and everything
he should be king
then follows a musical interlude during which groucho says speaking to audience you know i think they think i should be king
then turning to the guests singing although it would please me to govern the throng suppose i were king and then everything went wrong
the king can do no wrong
the king can do no wrong
the king can do no wrong
they all sit of course youre all aware a king must have an heir some one to pass the family name along will some one tell me where id ever
get an heir if a king can do no wrong standing up the king can do no wrong
they all sit down suppose a pretty dame into my castle came and let us say that i was going strong
she might be stuck on me but what good would it be if the king can do no wrong
standing up the king can do to wrong
sitting down king solomon was game he gave each girl his name to number them would make a list that long ill bet his thousand wives led miserable lives if
the king can do no wrong
remaining seated we really think he should be king and wear a crown and everything
they think i should they think i should they think i should they think i should be king
my dear friends in time of peace we should forgive those who fought against us and so i have invited our former enemies
applause cut to door as it is being opened by two pages
trentino and vera enter
they both stop and bow in acknowledgment of the applause coming over scene
as they walk toward table and out of scene chico and harpo enter
the latter is carrying a carpet runner rolled up under his arm
he flips the carpet runner away from him on the floor holding onto one end
it rolls out and harpo strides majestically down its length toward the table with chico following
harpo pauses brings to light a cuspidor from under his coat puts it on the carpet and spits into it and continues on following chico who is now ahead of
harpo breaks into a run and he and chico dash madly to the table
they take seats on either side of groucho and without hesitating start to eat the food in front of them
the guests are standing
trentino and vera arrive at their places and everyone sits down
harpo reaches for a large service plate with a pretty picture on it pushes his plate away breaks the service plate with a knife
it breaks into little pieces like a jig saw puzzle
he mixes the pieces up and then starts to put them together again
groucho watches him
then helps him
stopping harpo as he tries to fit a piece no no this is the one
picking up a piece and placing it
a waiter places a dish of tasty food in front of groucho
he is just about to dig into it with his knife and fork when harpo turns the table toward himself
this brings grouchos food to harpo and chicos empty plate to groucho
that was awfully good i think ill have a second helping
snapping his finger to waiter off scene
the waiter immediately appears placing a second dish in front of groucho
he starts to dig his knife and fork into it again when chico turns the table toward himself
this brings his food to chico
harpo lifts his plate up and puts it down again when the table stops turning
this time groucho has nothing in front of him
if i dont stop eating ill get indigestion
to the left of chico
to chico would you mind passing the salt
yelling to harpo hey she wants some salt
harpo takes salt shaker from man to his right places it in front of himself and gives the table a quick turn toward the woman next to chico
groucho is still without food
he rises and looks about table
sees a dish of food in front of trentino who is seated at opposite side of table
trentino is eating
yelling to trentino ambassador hows the food
looking up and turning in direction of groucho its delicious your excellency
thats all i wanted to know
he gives the table a quick turn and trentinos plate disappears as it spins around toward groucho
just as it gets to harpo he lifts up the plate
the table goes on a few feet more and when it stops harpo puts down his plate and starts to eat
again groucho has nothing
groucho picks up his napkin and wipes his mouth
i couldnt eat another thing
he stands up ladies and gentlemen i want to introduce to you a man who is a prince of good fellows generous to a fault his own worst enemy and
a devil in his own hometown
groucho steps up on the table thanks i didnt expect to be called upon
however in conclusion i want to tell you that i promised mrs
teasdale id marry her if we won the war
well we won the war and im stuck
to the victor belongs the spoils
the table starts to turn slowly
groucho starts to walk in opposite direction
staying in same place
in union there is strength
the table moves a little faster
groucho increases his pace accordingly
cut to harpo and chico now seated beside each other turning the table
cut back to groucho
i feel that we are taking a step in the right direction and thats what i call balling the jack
speed of table turning increases
groucho keeping pace against it in tread mill fashion
now is not the time for political temporizing all interests must be sacrificed for the common weal
cut to harpo and chico turning table
faster and faster
we cut back to groucho who is now galloping to keep his spot but hes not going any place all those who want to place their money on the wheel
step inside faint heart never won fair lady
money wont grow in your pocket like the hair on your head and now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their party
this fades out on a shot with groucho running madly and gesticulating taking in harpo and chico turning the table
