written by judd apatow pete and debbie are having fantastic sex in the shower
debbie moans loudly
pete is strong and sure of himself
in total control
oh my god
this is crazy
oh my god
want to know a secret
i took a viagra
i took a viagra
those things totally work
this is awesome
why dont i use this every day
what did you do
debbie gets out of the shower
whats the matter
you just took a viagra to have sex with me
i thought it would make it better
it was better
it takes some of the pressure off
because you cant get hard without a viagra
is it because you dont think im sexy
i thought youd think it was fun for me to supersize it for once
that is the worst birthday present you could ever give someone
i was just trying to go turbo for your birthday
my hard ons are still in analog
this shits digital
i dont want a turbo penis
i like your medium soft one
look i can get it up
just not that far up
where did you get this
i got it from barry
you got it from barry
why do you care
this is my dick were talking about not yours
we are young people
we dont need medication to have sex
i only took it because its your birthday
i thought youd like it
happy fucking fortieth birthday
i am not forty
and i dont want to have a husband who has to take viagra to get a hard on
i dont have to take it every time but once in a while
forty can suck my dick
pete sneaks down the hallway
he kisses sadie as he wakes her
she wants to be left alone
your breath smells weird
pete breathes all over her as he talks
wake up wake up
time to get up
pete lifts a sleeping charlotte out of bed and walks her downstairs
it looks ridiculous because she is too tall to hold her like she is a baby
pete and the kids set up a tray of muffins and donuts on the table and decorate the room with birthday balloons streamers etc
pete sneaks bacon cupcakes and mini donuts into his mouth occasionally
the house is a bit more cluttered and messier than when we last saw it in knocked up
debbie opens a window and sneaks a cigarette
she holds her cigarette with a yellow dish washing glove
she puts out the cigarette and goes through an elaborate routine of hiding the smell of smoke
she puts some weird oil in her hair and uses a wet nap on her neck and clothes and brushes her teeth
she sprays cologne and walks through it
pete and the kids hold a cake and sing happy birthday as debbie walks in
when they are done she blows out the candles on the cake which says happy th birthday
make a wish
the kids eat cereal
sadie watches lost on her ipad while pete and debbie talk in the kitchen
can i watch lost
you cant handle lost
its too violent and you wont understand
if i dont understand it why cant i handle it
because youre eight
i can handle it
ive seen a shark eat a guy on shark week
shark week is fake
no its not
all of it is reenactments
i know but they thats scary
you shouldnt be allowed to watch that
they show the reenactments but they actually happened
its going to give you nightmares
i can handle a nightmare
youre a nightmare every day for me
pete clears the breakfast dishes
dont eat that cupcake
the one you just put into the sink
i saw you were hiding that
you think im going to eat this cupcake
i so dont want this cupcake
he turns on the faucet and pours water on the cupcake
youre still going to eat it
im going to eat this cupcake
just put it in the trash
what would you like to do today
just hang out with you guys
dont you want to get a massage
or do something fun
im turning thirty eight
well move on
isnt it weird that our birthday is the same week and that were going to have a party and its just for me
i dont think its weird at all
because youre turning forty and im turning thirty eight
do you really want to be one of those ladies whos just so insecure about their age and they lie and then theyve got to remember
you dont get it
you dont understand how it works
i dont want to shop at old lady stores
i dont want to go to j
jill and chicos and ann taylor loft
im not ready yet
i need two more years
that is so insane it kind of makes sense
what did you get me for my birthday
i thought you said that we shouldnt get each other gifts this year
what do you mean
youre supposed to get me a surprise gift
this is a big birthday
im turning forty
charlotte plays the theme from the office on her keyboard
sadie tears apart her closet looking for clothes
why cant i get new clothes
nothing fits me
god damn it
debbie is in workout gear
pete enters wearing a lycra outfit with all sorts of logos on it
he is a complete bicycling asshole
i am going to work out
ill be back in about an hour
hey did your father call to wish you a happy birthday
thats no surprise
pete picks the soaking wet cupcake out of the sink and takes a bite
debbie runs up a long flight of stairs with her trainer jason
her friend barb trails behind
youve got to keep up with us sweetheart
thats why your body looks like your body and her body looks like her body
you guys just go on without me
im just gonna
we see pete in a large group of bikers riding down san vicente
petes friend barry is part of the group
hey thanks for letting me join this team
its not really a team its just a bunch of guys who get together and ride
i know i know
a car makes a right turn in front of pete nearly hitting him
pete bangs on the back of the car
bike lane asshole
its always the guy in the fucking infiniti
debbie is doing sit ups while talking to jason who holds her feet down
in the background barb stretches on a yoga ball
so why on earth is pete taking viagra
whats going on
i dont know
i think maybe he just isnt attracted to me anymore
that is ridiculous
if you were my girlfriend i would not need a viagra
i would need an anti viagra pill
to try not to get a boner
but everyone gives you a boner
dont sell yourself short like that
you give me a boner
whispers barb doesnt give me a boner
maybe things are just getting stale
thats why maybe i work out really hard
maybe hell be able to get a boner again
why do you need to have sex deb
sex is the number one thing people fight about
you stop having sex there will be no more fights
i am living proof
i have no sex and i am the happiest ive ever been
i knew it
i knew you were not having sex
i can see it on your face
its all puckered and pained
im enjoying our non sex period thats all im saying
dont you miss it
well i wouldnt know because i dont have any feeling down there anymore
i have nerve damage from my c section so everything is just kinda shes numb down there
i could sit down hard on a fire hydrant and i wouldnt even know that i was sitting
i could get stung by a hornet down there and i would not feel it
you could put anything in there and i would not know what the object was
i used to pee in a nice stream and now it just kind of goes like a shower head
that is the saddest thing ive ever heard
i think you need a family
dont you want a family
no i think i want to clooney it
he doesnt seem happy
yeah he is
no hes not
see i think he has sad eyes
aw you sweet little thing
hes doing sad lonely eyes
to get the next lady
i can do it too watch
i bet george clooney is really lonely
just him and his pig
youd fuck him
so would you
i wouldnt feel it but youd fuck him with your numb vagina
yes you would
oceans thirteen inches thats what youd find out
do you think
pete and barry eat frosted scones happy to get some alone time to delay their return home
i mean that was idiotic
you have to understand
thats like the one thing you dont do is tell her you used viagra
i think thats even on the warning label
were in one of those phases where everything the other person says just annoys the shit out of each other
all the time
its a blast
dont worry about it
you just gotta ride that out
this sounds terrible but do you ever wonder what it would be like if say you were separated by something bigger like death
like her death
i have given it a fair amount of thought
not in a painful way
just quietly slid into death
like a gas leak
it has got to be peaceful
i mean this is the mother of your children
id want it to be a peaceful just like drift into a coma from which she never awakens
then you move on
then youre a widower
thats just it
people love widowers
they love widowers
its like the polar opposite of divorced guys
its the best
its like oh that poor widower
if i could only somehow
make him happy
somehow ease his pain
cocksuck away his sadness
the family is driving
sadie watches an episode of lost on an ipad
the pixies play on the stereo and pete sings along
did you know that the pixies did this song about a salvador dali short film called un chien andalou
this music doesnt make people happy
this song kicks off doolittle one of the best albums of the last thirty years
an important record
look how angry you get while listening to this
beat its my birthday
you dont control the radio on my birthday
i control the radio on my birthday
debbie switches the radio and sings along to take on me by ah hah
sadie stares at her ipad
we see a violent scene
sadies watching lost
sadie how many times have you watched lost this week
ive only watched eleven
i have eight more and then im done
how many are there
a hundred and fourteen
are you kidding me
you cant watch over a hundred episodes of a show in five weeks
itll melt your brain
its not melting my brain its blowing my mind
thats really bad sadie
youre not allowed to do that
my relationship with lost is not your business
its extremely personal
charlotte grabs for sadies ipad then starts trying to lick her
be nice to your sister
you guys are going to cherish each other one day
pete and debbie get out of the car and walk down the street
its your birthday you dont need to go to the store
i know just five minutes
i think desi and jodi are fighting
all right five minutes
but then im pulling you out
pete and debbie enter and we see their two employees jodi and a new gorgeous employee desi who is up on a ladder
hows jodi treating you
oh jodis my new bff
shes like a little kitty cat
sometimes she comes and rubs up against my leg
youre a ball of shit
she loves me
debbie goes behind the register
she looks at jodi
can you do inventory so that we can do the sidewalk sale
and you really need to pay attention to the numbers because we have twelve thousand dollars unaccounted for
i think its probably desi
shes been having a really hard time using these simple computers
its because shes stupid
i think she might be stealing
shes not stealing
shes our best employee
she made nine grand last month
well how much did i make
you brought in twenty two hundred
thats not bad
well thats not that good
i mean im not comparing you but youre not as good
pete is still staring at desi on the ladder
to desi all right
pete walks over to debbie
i dont think shes wearing underwear
its all dark up there
why are you looking
i didnt mean to look i just said hey woah
there it was
maybe shes wearing dark underwear
maybe she has underwear that has a picture of a vagina painted on it
desi comes down to help a customer at the front of the store
maybe some deep oranges and browns and maybe dark greens
that would really play up your features
ill just take out my amex and you pick what stuff you think is good
we see quick cuts of debbie playing with the kids on the trampoline outside
she does a full flip and lands on her feet
pete is nowhere to be found
i think he went to poop
debbie walks down the hall and into the bathroom without knocking
pete is on the toilet playing scrabble on his ipad
what are you doing
going to the bathroom
were all downstairs waiting for you
youve been up here for a really long time now
oh im almost done
ill be down in a second
charlotte just did her first flip on the trampoline and she landed on her feet
she was really proud of herself
oh thats great
and you missed it
shell do it again
its just that this is the fourth time youve gone to the bathroom today
give me a break
why is your instinct to escape
its not my instinct to escape from you
it is my instinct to come into the bathroom when i need to go to the bathroom
how come i dont smell anything
its because i shoved an altoid up my ass before i came in here
let me see then
let me see
no im not going to let you see
youre not going to let me see because youre not taking a poop
ive been flushing as i go
youre flushing as you go
who takes a half hour to go to the bathroom
thinks for a second john goodman
she angrily grabs his ipad and walks out
dont press enter
im not sure i want to make that move
a sign outside reads tonight only graham parker pete stands on stage speaking to a small crowd
you know when i started this label my dream was to work with musicians and bands whose music i just admired so much
the person that i thought my god wouldnt it be incredible to work with was graham parker
tonight we have him
because we couldnt afford to fly in the rumour
the crowd applauds as graham parker s leaps on stage
pete and debbie watch graham sing a very moving song
the song is fantastic and personal but clearly not commercial
we watch debbie
although the music is great its a little depressing and not working on her
she quickly gets bored
pete and debbie are driving home
its just not my kind of music
what is your kind of music
i like lady gaga
oh god of course you do
shallow dance music
its fun and its about release and sex and power
you know you dont have to like it
its really not for you thats fine
this is a job
this is not a hobby
cant you love him just as a hobby
and sign a fifteen year old hot girl so we can eat
graham parker and the rumour had two albums in the rolling stone top best albums of all time
two of em
if i can just sell ten thousand records to his hardcore fan base were golden
an ambulance drives by sirens blaring
pause then laughing the last of graham parkers fans just died
pete and debbie walk in mid argument
sadie is listening to a song on her iphone
sadie what are you listening to
okay this is music that makes people happy
and this is what people buy
she puts sadies ipod in a dock and plays the nikki minaj rap romans revenge
they all start rapping along to it
they all laugh and dance and go crazy
pete turns the ipod off
why did you take it off
now something that really rocks
pete puts on rooster by alice in chains
this is called good music
from somebodys heart
this is bumming me out
this isnt fun
just listen to these words okay
i dont understand the words
this is lyrics this is poetry
this is what is going to survive in a hundred years
it just doesnt make people happy
it makes me happy
i can dance to it
pete starts dancing around like it is fun
youre the only one in the room whos happy
pete stops his music
sometimes i wish just one of you had a dick
well we dont want one
pete sits with the kids and eats breakfast
debbie scurries around him to prep the kids for school
to pete is there something that you can do to be helping me right now
yeah im ready to help
just tell me what to do
can you go get a lunch box or something
for me or for them
charlotte runs away towards her room
ive got a test
charlotte im going to kill you
debbie covers sadies mouth
debbie drives the kids to school
debbie runs charlotte into the school
along the way they see a lot of parents
debbie says hi to them in the way that lets us know that she does not know anybodys name
debbie says hello to a pregnant fifty year old parent towing a seven year old boy
hi any day now huh
three more months
another parent beth and her adorable child walk over
katies dying for a play date
lets hook these two up
that would be great ill call you
beth and katie walk off
as they walk into class the teacher pulls debbie aside
listen charlotte really needs to get here on time because she needs the extra time to just settle in
we are on time
being on time means being early
well its nice to see you in class
wed like to see more of you
i come to the teacher walks away before debbie can defend herself
hi grandma molly
how are you
im so happy about the science fair
its going very well i heard
i love you
you look so beautiful
i just learned its your fortieth
are you forty
i remember when i was forty and then i blinked and there i was going to be ninety
my god where did it go
one day youre going to blink and youre going to be ninety and i wont be around to see it
and that makes me very sad
im telling you im warning you
as debbie pulls out of the lot she lights a cigarette
pete paces around his office on the phone
and then you missed the mortgage payment and thats the second mortgage
youve got to tighten your belt
youve got to go home sit down look at your expenses come clean with debbie
i cant tell debbie
you have to tell her pete
she knows its bad but she has no idea just how bad
if you sell the house itll really buy you some time
debbies not really into selling the house
as your business manager and your friend i cant recommend that
beat hey how funny would it be if i bought your house
hang in there
pete is with ronnie and cat employees at his record label
they are watching an electronic press kit cut together for graham parker
there is a montage of him performing throughout the years from the seventies to the present
what are you doing
im contextualizing him as one of the great figures in rock history
you cant show him in his prime in and then jump straight to him as he is now
you have to reverse it
youve got to show him as he is now very briefly and then show him in
you have to benjamin button it
i dont know what youre talking about okay
all rock stars are older now
steven tyler david bowie mick jagger paul mccartney
okay stop it
everybody youre mentioning looks like an old woman now
youre just mentioning a bunch of jessica tandys
keith richards gets away with it
but thats because keith richards looked seventy when he was forty and now that hes seventy he looks sixty nine
i like it
and i think graham parker is sexy
would you fuck him
youd fuck him and you wont fuck me
i mean i kind of fucked you once if you could have finished
oh i finished
you know what enough of who fucked who and who finished what
its a retro label
thats our niche
thats our market
it costs money to break new bands i cant do that
and also youre the guy who turned down arcade fire
everyone turned down arcade fire
its crazy there are so many of them
we dont have the money to market a new band
we just need to make graham seem relevant
who is he talking to
um the jewish journal
the jewish journal
apparently old jews are the only ones who still buy hard copies of records
because they dont like to download music
because they dont know what downloading means
angle on graham and a journalist wearing a yarmulke
why is this album different from any other album
angle on pete cat and ronnie
what is he wearing
its a hat with the oreo logo on it
i dont think hes being ironic i think he just really likes oreos
the paul westerberg record did okay
frank black did all right
the haircut not so much
we have to break this record
otherwise were not here next year
oreo man is coming
graham walks up
hey guys how are you
arent cookies the best
jewish journal guy loves the record
got a bit of a problem
touch of gout
yeah my whole family they all had gout
thats very unfortunate
my auntie queenie she had a foot like the size of a small pig
ive got a photo of it
id love to see that photo of that gout foot
a couple of bunions as well
ive got to go to the podiatrist and i hope he can shoot me up with something
yeah well lets get you to the podiatrist
see you later graham
good luck with your gout
rock and roll baby
pete and debbie are talking
debbie holds a list of changes she wants to make
the happiest period in peoples lives is from age forty to sixty
so this is it
were in it right now
says a lot of people most people
we have everything we need right now to be completely happy
were going to blink and be ninety
so lets just choose to be happy
your eyes are kind of glazing over
no im just processing it all
some of these i wrote for you
so we have to exercise every day
spend more time alone together
we have to go to the therapist every week
thats a little pricey
no stressing over tiny things
yeah thats good
you should do that
we have to get more involved in school
have more patience with the kids
and we need to work on our anger
yeah i think it would be good if you could take care of your anger
no i said both of us
thats what i said
no more smoking
yeah youve got to cut that out
i dont want to make this about a fight i want to just be positive
okay and then no more holding on to resentments
we have to just let that go
so youre saying that if were arguing and i apologize youll let it go and not throw it back in my face later
well i dont do that but i will continue not to do that
what did you write
all of that
thats a lot
and youre going to eat better
ive been doing a decent job but i dont think theres anything wrong with having some fries every now and again
and then ill smoke that day
thats not the same thing
it is the same thing
i like fries
and the other thing is your dad stuff
pete picks up a guitar and starts playing with it
the not letting him guilt trip you all the time because that puts a lot of pressure on you and the whole family feels it
hes a grown man and hes not our responsibility
and youre not giving him money anymore right
no i havent been giving him money for years i told you
can you please put that down
pete and debbie are in bed
debbie has a computer on her lap
a lot of people are rsvp ing to your birthday party
you sure you dont want to just do a joint birthday party
we always used to
we reveal that debbie is watching security cam footage of the store
did jodi tell you she thinks desis stealing
are you serious
twelve thousand dollars
and desis taking it
well i dont know
thats what jodi said
we really need the store to work
dont put that kind of pressure on me
thats not what i mean
are you nervous about money
are we okay
maybe we just suck it up because shes clearly earning so much more than any other employee we have
we cant fire her
were barely breaking even with her
thats why we have to keep her
we watch the footage and suddenly desis boyfriend enters
he walks behind the counter and she sits on his lap
she adjusts herself
look at this shes making out with somebody
on the screen they kiss
desi seems to be popping up and down a little
is she screwing him
that might be like a dry hump
look at the position of her skirt
thats too grainy to know for sure
oh my god this is the middle of the day
customers could be in there
at least shes getting some
what did you say
at least shes getting some
what are you talking about
we had sex the other night
you have to give me a little credit for that
its not about credit
we need to have more passion
thats not passion
it looks like passion to me
what pete farts
what is she doing
he farts again
it is longer
oh my god
dont do that
debbie hits pete with a pillow
what am i doing
dont fart in the bed
im not its the springs
this is why we never have sex
i dont know what youre talking about
pete farts again
charlotte jumps around in front of sadies door
sadie sits on her bed quietly doing homework
im doing my homework
okay watch this
theres a haunted cow back here and im pretty sure it does not have milk
charlotte grabs her own head and makes it look like shes being dragged away
did you see that
they took me away
sadie does not even look up
youre no fun
you never want to play
how many times do i have to tell you
charlotte plays air guitar
sadie does not respond
youre so mean since your body got weird
close the door
debbie and pete begin their fresh start
debbie tosses her cigarettes in the garbage cans outside
pete tosses a packet of m ms in the garbage
he throws out all of his cupcakes except for one
he takes a bite tries to throw it but again cant
he takes another bite holds it over the garbage then takes one last bite before dumping what little remains
pete runs on a treadmill while getting an electrocardiogram
debbie is getting a mammogram
the machine clamps too hard on her breast
pete gets his testicles examined

nobody wants curtains
they think of it like a luxury
its not a luxury
you need shade you need privacy

two other identical children enter and jump on larry

i cant lend you any more money
no thats a bad idea
thats not the way to cut back
i have three children here

larry stands up and walks outside
larry prepares to spray the kids with the hose
line up for murder
who wants to be killed
okay were eliminating one were cheaper already
larry sprays him with the hose
all right the kids are murdered
that will save us some money
why would you have three kids anyway
i mean youre sixty years old
you have no money
because claire wanted a baby
if we didnt at least try she would have left me
she was forty five years old
nobody thought it would take
the doctor when we were doing in vitro was winking at me like dont worry dont worry
we were very unlucky
and now we have these three beautiful children
come on ive got to tell you something
your mother wanted you aborted
oh jesus christ
its the truth
it was the seventies
we were twenty two years old
thats what everybody did
you did some blow had sex had an abortion
we were on the way to the doctors office
i said lets stop have a pizza talk about it if you still want to do it after lunch its okay
the pizza saved your life

i dont have a number
you just keep giving like youre giving
larrys wife claire enters

be right back
debbie picks up his iphone and sadly scrolls through all the happy pictures of his new family
the familys hanging out relaxing at dinner
daddy and i are making some changes so that we can be happier and healthier and were starting with this meal that i prepared
i think it looks great
doesnt it look good
what is that grilled cheeses
no baked tofu
its actually really tasty
and the lettuce is so fresh and tasty that you forget how good lettuce tastes on its own without dressing
yeah dressing always gets in the way of the natural taste of the lettuce
and another thing weve decided is to cut back on all of the electronics we use
what were going to do is get rid of the wi fi and only use the computer from eight to eight thirty at night
how are we going to go on the computer
were going to have a hard line in the kitchen
yeah well supervise that
you cant do this
you cant take away the wi fi
charlotte holds her iphone to her face using an app that animates her mouth to look like a talking monkeys
from behind her iphone no wi fi
ha ha ha
you dont spend enough time with the family when youre constantly on your iphone and your computer
youre only here five more years
so you wont see me after five years
no but you wont be living with us
and you should get to know your little sister
youve got the perfect friend right here
i dont want to be friends with her now
ill be friends with her when shes twenty and a normal person
i dont want to hang out with her when im in my twenties
youre on your computer too much as it is
you need to get outside more
you can build things
you can build a fort
yeah build a fort
play with your friends
make a fort
and do what in the fort
when i was a kid we used to build tree houses and play with sticks
nobody plays with sticks
you and charlotte can have a lemonade stand
play kick the can
look for dead bodies
get a tire and then take a stick and run down the street with it
nobody does that crap
you dont need technology
charlotte holds the iphone monkey app to her lips again
charlotte put that down
i dont need to be monitored all the time on the computer
i dont do anything bad
nobody said you were bad
i dont do things im not supposed to
i dont illegally download music
i dont look at porn like wendy
she is up to no good
shes not allowed to come over here anymore
no she said corn
this isnt turning out the way i wanted it to
im not hungry
sadie gets up and stomps off
listen to your mom
i need to use it for my homework
she walks off
shes outplaying us
pete and debbie drive down the pacific coast highway
this is the best birthday present
its good to get away you know
we havent been to laguna without the kids in years
if were happy theyre happy
i mean i cant take it
with the hormones and the crying and do my homework
thems little bitches
thems lil bitches
bugging us for shit all the time
and they never appreciate anything
theyre selfish assholes
laughs aw i feel bad
i love them
the car pulls up to a beautiful hotel in laguna
i miss them already
should we go home
pete and debbie hold hands as they walk the hotel grounds
they enter their room which has a beautiful ocean view
debbie jumps on the bed
pete jumps on top to kiss her
pete and debbie jump into the hotel pool together
pete holds debbie in the water
pete and debbie are in bed in their underwear
why do we fight
i dont know it makes no sense at all
it makes no sense
when we get in a fight look in my eyes
lets remember this moment right now and know that we never have to fight
but youre such a dick sometimes
i know i am a dick sometimes
people think im so nice but im such a dick
thank you for admitting that
and you get so mad at me
i feel like you want to kill me
i do want to kill you
how would you do it
i dont know
id poison your cupcakes that you pretend not to eat everyday
and just put enough in to slowly weaken you
i love it
i would enjoy our last few months together
because youd be so weak and sweet and i could take care of you but while killing you
you know what i love about us
you can still surprise me
i figured for sure youd knock me out with one fell swoop
but you would extend it over a series of months
have you ever thought about killing me
how would you do it
a wood chipper
did you see fargo
pete makes a wood chipping splatter noise
thats a bad plan
the cupcakes is a way better plan
you know what
i wont murder you
i love you
i love you too
you know what i brought
a medical marijuana cookie
ben gave it to me last christmas
chocolate chip koo kie
should we do it
lets eat the cookie and then well order a bunch of cheeseburgers
lets order the entire room service menu
just get all of it
you deserve it
you really do
wouldnt you rather have me around for less years and im incredibly happy than longer and miserable
yes and i just realized that right now
go get the cookie
pete runs into the bathroom
he looks for the cookie
should we watch porn when we eat the cookie
should we get a block of porn
i dont think we need twenty four hours of porn
yeah but you know two porns cost about as much as a block
i think thats too much porn
we dont have to watch it all but for the value it makes sense
pete and debbie eat the cookie
how much are we supposed to eat
i dont know
i think like six or seven cookies right
plus its old
it probably has lost some of its potency
they sit in silence for an incredibly long amount of time staring through each other in a haze
they are stoned
we should have sex
i mean girls have it so easy
you just show up with your sexual organs and youre good to go
all the pressure is on the guy
and i look at guys like i look at a guy like prince and you know that guy fucks
i know i dont fuck like prince
prince can fuck
i fuck more like david schwimmer
i fuck like ross from friends
theyre laughing and having a good time
stoned pete and debbie jump up and down on the bed
they fall down on the bed kissing
almost totally under the covers they watch as a waiter brings in a room service cart full of food
pete does magic tricks for the waiter
how does he do it
the floating spoon
debbie hands pete a banana and two oranges which he holds to his crotch in front of the waiter
check it out
my dick and balls
im going to eat my own dick
pete eats a bite of the banana
i ate my dick
debbie crawls on the floor while pete lays in bed
i think this room has rodents
i just saw it
pete stands with a starfish sticking out of his underwear
have you seen my starfish
where did i put my starfish
they eat room service
chips and desserts and everything
im going to deep throat this eclair
she tries to deep throat it
pete loves it
i want to make out with you so bad
pete and debbie drive back from laguna
they could not look happier or more refreshed
they hold hands and smile at each other
it is a beautiful day
they pull up to their house shut off the car and sit for a beat knowing theyre about to head back into the stress of the real world not wanting
their peaceful loving time to end
that was nice
that was nice
sadie walks outside
jodi follows her
shes got an ear infection again
i didnt know what to do
to debbie were home
charlotte is crying really hard
are you okay
whats the matter
i just want to rip my ear off it hurts so much
to pete i told you the pediatrician didnt know what he was talking about
oh come on
you cant blame it on our doctor
ear infections are common in little kids
not in kids over six years old
were going to the eastern doctor
if shes in this much pain we should call a real doctor
are you kidding right now
charlotte sits on the table
pete and debbie are talking to dr
seduku a foreign doctor
what we should do is easy and simple
no more dairy no more wheat no more sugar
sugar wheat and dairy
mutters what the fuck is left
isnt everything sugar wheat and dairy
she can have vegetables and f r ruits
seduku has both an accent and a lisp
oh she can eat fr r ruits
fr r ruits yes
any kind of fr r ruits
it isnt like there are safe fr r ruits and then unsafe fr r ruits
what about f r r rench f r r ries
can we do something like that
are you okay
would you like to come on the table
why dont you go on the table
why dont you go on the table
it looks like you need to get on the table
i dont want to get on the table
pete cycles with the crew
debbie looks around the house for pete
debbie sees pete on the bed his legs up in the air
he still has his bike top on but is naked from the waist down
he is trying to look at his back end
he is holding a mirror and an iphone
what are you doing
i need you to look at something
in my butt
i think ive got something in there and im not limber enough to see
i need you to look at it
i might have like an anal fissure or a hemorrhoid or a worm or something
what are you doing with your phone
trying to take pictures of it so i can compare it to something on google
can we just keep like a small shred of mystery in our relationship
look i saw you have two babies okay
seriously i need you to get all up in that
i do not want to investigate your anus
its payback time
pete has his naked legs hiked up over his head
debbie takes a very quick glance inside
its a hemorrhoid
now erase that from your memory
debbie talks to jodi while they fold clothes and watch desi
where did she get those clothes
those are expensive
where do you think
i dont want this to sound harsh but everything that comes out of her mouth is a lie
everything that comes into it is a dick
everything that goes in is dicks
dont say that
im sorry im just being protective of the store
im going to go talk to her
debbie walks over to desi
is that your new acura out front
its so nice
do you love it
well i mean its not a fucking porsche but itll do for now
hey desi would you mind wearing some of the clothes we have in the store
desi picks a shirt
desi begins to take all her clothes off in front of debbie
you know i actually made this one myself
i did the tiger on a piece of paper separately and then i transferred it to the t shirt
so you stenciled on the tiger
i drew it on a piece of paper and then i transferred the drawing to the t shirt
you have an amazing body
are those real
do you want to touch them
debbie squeezes desis breasts
i mean they really are amazing
thats firm for real
theyre like a memory mattress
like tempurpedic you know
they look amazing
my kids just sucked the meat right out of mine
theres some meat in there
since i had kids my boobs are just gone
they didnt even say goodbye
they just left
by the time im forty these are going to go national geographic on me
i feel bad about myself right now
pete talks is in his office on the phone with his realtor
i think this is a really good offer on the house
we expected more
i mean i know its a bad market but thats still way under what we were looking for
i know but based on the market its like youre gaining money
because its so much more than what you deserve
but these people are from iran and they dont really know that theyre offering too much
is there any chance that debbie will go for it
i doubt it
i dont know
theres a lot of inventory out there
whats her problem
she has unrealistic expectations
sadie and her friend wendy run around the yard with charlotte and the triplets
larry and debbie greet the kids when they enter the kitchen
larry picks up one of the triplets
did you miss me travis
my daddy doesnt know my name
can i go show them my crystals before they leave
yeah really quick
charlotte leaves with the triplets
go play with your tiny uncles
to debbie so what are you doing spring cleaning
im getting rid of everything in the house that has gluten or sugar
whats wrong with gluten
glutens really bad for you
i dont think so
dont you watch dr
as in the wizard of
we were wondering if we could use the computer to ichat
remember the rules
eight to eight thirty
yeah but i have a friend over
why dont you guys go play
you could go build a fort
remember the alamo
have you ever built a fort wendy
like on facebook
i will take this if youre going to throw it away because at our house were wheat eaters
but dont you want to live long enough to see your kids grow up
thats up to god honey
but thats really not good for the kids
the kids eat grass
this is fine
larry takes some of the food shes throwing out
wendys mom lets her go on whenever she wants
my moms pretty cool about it as long as i finish my homework
well i guess im not the cool one
but the rules are just different in our house
but i get better grades than wendy
shes so smart
let me just grab the candy worms
your rules are ridiculous
dont sass me
im only sassing you because youre throwing out all the food in our house and im freaking starving
youre being stupid
wendy can you go stand in the other room please
give me your iphone now
the nougat things are good
i have all my contacts in there
okay if you dont give me your phone right now then im going to have to take away your phone and your computer
jesus christ thats it
i need my computer to do homework
no phone no computer
this is b
this is a bunch of f ing s
youre acting like a b
time to go
you go to your room right now
sadie runs off
calling after her you are not allowed to use iphone ipad ipod touch itunes netflix pandora or spotify
pete enters from the hallway
he sees larry and turns around before anyone notices him
shes a little pip
just like her mommy
so i might have a job tomorrow at least im going to go try to give an estimate
do you mind taking the kids for a couple hours
this is nice
you and i dont spend enough time together do we
we spend enough time together
its quality time
then we do
ill go with what you think
pete and debbie are in bed
pete is reading sadies ichats on her confiscated ipad out loud to debbie
what else did they say
some kid named joseph i know joseph
hes making a hot or not list
so sadie said thats so lame and immature that youre doing that
and then joseph says yo girl
were just having some fun so dont be a bitch yo
that is not nice
so then sadie said dont call me a bitch
and joseph said i didnt call you a bitch i said dont act like a bitch
and by the way youre in the not hot column
who made him the judge of hot
do you realize what that could do to her self esteem
what a little fuckhead
ill kill him
so then sadie said youre in the jackass column
ive got to go
im bored of you
that is cool
thats taking the high road
for some reason theres an emoticon of a panda doing push ups
i wonder what that means
i dont think it means anything i think its just adorable
shes a good girl
she was polite and she stood up for herself
thats pretty cool
they hear a door slam
i thought she was coming in
oh my god that scared me to death
if she caught us she would kill us
debbie starts looking through the ipad
petes iphone chimes
he sees a message from ronnie from work
it reads got the numbers
pete looks ashen
he looks over at debbie who is oblivious
ive got to make a call
whispering loudly we sold how many
six hundred and twelve album downloads
wait a minute
there are no zeros after that
there are zeros but all of them are before six hundred and twelve
there are none after
how is that even possible
out of three hundred million americans six hundred and twelve people chose to download the album
you could personally call everyone who bought this record
heres the deal
i want you to meet me tomorrow morning at eight oclock
i want a list of at least thirty ideas of what we can do to change this
we have to change this
i started a record label because i couldnt get a job so i have no other options
pete is driving
sadie and charlotte sing show tunes loudly and happily
pete is very upset about the record not selling
debbie is talking to their accountant
what financial problems
well for one thing you were right you are missing about ten thousand dollars from the store
and then petes record not selling well
i thought we werent supposed to hear for three weeks
and theyre bad
you know its that and its the money that hes been lending to his father thats creating a strain
how much have we lent him
did you say eight thousand or eighty thousand
eighty thousand over the past couple of years
and then you missed the mortgage payment on the house
and you missed the rental on the office
does pete know that
were on the phone all the time
look i know youre going through a hard time and i want you guys to know that were here for you okay
anything you guys need thats why were here
were here for times like this
what are you going to do
theres not much i can do
pete enters and walks into ronnies office
ronnie is drawing on a blackboard behind his desk
what are you doing
im drawing the album cover for van halens diver down
if you spent a little bit more time focusing on graham parker instead of drawing album covers i wouldnt be in this predicament
im focused on graham parker
youre supposed to help me with him
youre supposed to call the companies youre supposed to get people to the show
ive done everything i can pete
you had me pushing around a corpse
it was like being in fucking weekend at grahams
what should we do
im out of ideas
you fly in the rumour
i cant sell a reunion concert without the band
i cant afford it
you put this on yourself
you wanted the responsibility take it on the chin and stop acting like a bitch
what did you call me
pete walks out of ronnies office and into the main office space
i have an apartment i have health insurance i have car payments
i have responsibilities
dont talk to me about responsibilities
i have a life
i have a family
i cant afford to sit in my apartment getting high jerking off and then going to tommys chili burgers at three in the morning
thats not even the order that happens in
i have everything to lose here
because you spent thousands of dollars on shit we dont need
you really need to spend thirty thousand dollars on a fucking neon sign dude
which is inside
its not even outside
we know where we work
if you want to sign a band you have to look like youre the real deal
to cat princess labia how much is it to fly the rumour in
its twelve thousand
twelve thousand dollars
you know what
fly in the rumour
put it on my amex
debbie sits in dr
no you said it was impossible
i dont think i said it was impossible
i usually dont say impossible
i like to leave some wiggle room
you said that my fibroid was like a giant boulder like the one from the indiana jones movies blocking up my uterus
and i need to stop using that reference of indiana jones
i think thats not appropriate when talking about the reproductive system
anyway somehow the eastern medicine has worked and the fibroid has dissipated
your fibroid shrunk and somehow it allowed you to get pregnant
youre going to have your third baby
debbie does not react
would you like some water
thats good news
another baby at forty
i am thrilled
and pete is going to be so happy
so youre okay
what a relief
i can finally relax now you know
im so happy i really am
we cannot tell what she is feeling
then after a few beats a joyous smile appears across her face
pete takes a framed item off of his wall
larry answers the door
pete is there with a framed drawing made by john lennon
hey why are you in a bathrobe
its the middle of the afternoon
i took a late shower
why are you busting my balls
look im sorry about the record
youre going through financial shit
this is what i live with
this is a horrible time in human history
what is that
something that might help both of our situations
pete hands him the drawing
this is a drawing by john lennon
i got it ten years ago for five thousand dollars
i dont know how much its worth now
could be five could be twenty
i dont want this
i dont even like it
im not going to hang it up
its not for you to hang up
its for you to sell
that way i can give it to you and you can make some money and debbie doesnt know that im giving you anything
well youre not giving me money
youre giving me a project
i dont know how to sell this
im not an art dealer
just sell it online
do some research make some calls
or is that too hard to do with your high blood pressure
dont get snippy
just because you write a great song doesnt mean you can draw
john lennon drew it
i think its a ringo
dont beat me up if i get three hundred dollars for it
dont take less than sixty five hundred for that
its very valuable
its important to me
i want you to sell it so i can help you
ill see you at my party
what should i bring
you want wine or something
dont buy wine with my money and give it to me at my party
i love you
how do i call ebay
sadie and a bunch of other kids are building sets for a school play
sadie talks with a friend
pete and debbie are watching from afar sitting next to each other
debbie tries to gently break the news
shes so cute
shes so tall
how did that happen
do you ever wish we had a bigger family
no never for a second
i love what we have
put a bullet in my head
debbie is totally deflated
i think about that gray haired pregnant lady from school and i just feel bad for her
and i feel bad for the kid
can you imagine
all the other little kids wheres your mommy
oh shes the one sitting in that scooter eating a soft cracker
kids dont want to have old parents
you know it would also be nice for us to spend some time apart
kind of rediscover who we are individually
it would be so great to not see you for like a chunk of time so that i could really just miss you
remember when we used to miss each other
debbie is walking through the campus upset
she sees a kid and darts over to him
joseph the kid who insulted sadie on her facebook turns and sees debbie
im sadies mom
sadie the one you chat with on the internet
that aint me
well it was you i saw your picture
did you make a hot list and not put sadie on the hot list
she was not on my list no
you know what im going to do
im going to make my own hot list and you know what
youre on the not hot list
how does that feel
it doesnt bother me
im comfortable with the way i am
she gets even quieter scarier and more in his face
maybe you shouldnt be so comfortable with yourself
you know why
you look like a miniature tom petty
hows that feel
you think that haircuts cool
it looks like you put your justin bieber wig on backwards
you still comfortable with yourself
why are you wearing a tank top
so you can show off your bald pits you little hairless wonder
cool tank top man
so next time you think about writing something nasty on my daughters facebook page just remember me
i will come down here and i will fuck you up
joseph looks upset
okay im sorry
wait a minute
are you crying
just let me go
im not in my right head
my mom is going through menopause too
its a hard time
what did you say
youre going through menopause
im not going through menopause
im not going to go through menopause for twenty years
im pregnant you little bitch
god damn it
she storms off
debbie pulls open the door pete is on the toilet playing on his ipad
im going out to coffee with desi to find out if shes stealing from us
ive got the graham parker concert
whos gonna watch the kids
i dont know
figure it out
pete flips her off after shes gone
debbie and desi are talking as they walk down the stairs into a loud club
i just wanted to talk
maybe we could go to a coffee house or something
you want coffee
this place has coffee
they have all kinds of drinks
debbie and desi talk to a group of young men professional
what sport do you guys play

you guys are all from philadelphia
no actually none of us are
do you guys still have all of your teeth
well ive got all my teeth except for these ones
he takes a plate of his teeth out
want to try them on
desi takes them and tries to put them in her mouth
do i look sexy
desi looks insane
she tries to kiss debbie
everyone is laughing
they definitely look way better on her than they do on you
she hands the teeth back to their owner
he pops them back in and everyone cheers
so should we go to the quiet area

graham is packing up to go

pete sits in the car crying
debbie is dropping desi off at her apartment
why did you put that guys teeth in your mouth
thats so gross
he was dirty
no he was wearing a tie
when i kissed him i felt his little tiny teeth nubs with my tongue
it was like kissing a baby
french kissing a baby
can i ask you something stupid
do you know why were missing money at the store
are you guys missing money
like twelve thousand dollars
do you think i took it
i did but now i dont
its not me
then why do you live in such a nice apartment and have such a fancy car
yes youre right
am an escort
i get paid to go out on dates
debbie looks shocked
but only three to five times a year
ten times max
but its not technically prostitution because i dont have to sleep with them
well thats good
but i always do
thats why i only do it four to eight times a year fifteen times max
one year i did it twenty
as long as you think its safe
i only do it ten to thirty times a year
so who do you think is stealing money
shes a pilled out whore
since you told me i want to tell you something
how did you know
maybe you should tell pete
you didnt tell pete yet
i dont know
i just want him to want me
i dont want him to want me because im pregnant
go home and suck his dick and tell him then and he will love it
hell be so excited
or even better yet you should tell him while youre sucking his dick
mimes a blow job im pregnant
pete on his ipad laying in bed
debbie comes in to talk
what are you doing
im returning some emails
what time do you have to go to work
like ten minutes ago
want to be late
debbies shirt is unbuttoned and she is topless
not looking up no i cant be late
do you see me
standing here in front of you
and does that make you feel anything
are you trying to start a fight
no im not trying to start a fight with you
im trying to fuck you
oh god you know what
today of all days you need to give me a break all right
she exits into the bathroom
i didnt realize it was intentional
i didnt say anything because i didnt want you to be embarrassed
i thought i was being gallant
all right fine im an asshole
debbie returns dressed
you know what your problem is
youre never in the moment youre never present
youre never in your body
thats not true
i am in the moment
you know how i know
i want to get the fuck out of the moment
i swear i cant win with you
pete walks out of the room
you cant just walk away
hows the record company going pete
im still waiting for numbers to come in
what have you heard
a couple numbers have trickled in
its lower than we expected
then why are you giving larry money
i know everything
i talked to the accountant
all right you know what
i dont want to get into some nasty fight
so can we please talk to each other like the therapist told us to talk to each other
it makes me feel sad when you are dishonest
i understand it makes you feel bad when i am dishonest with you
it hurts my feelings when you treat me with contempt and corner me and try and trick me into lying
it makes me sad when its so easy to trick you into lying because youre such a lying shitbag
you cant do that
the therapist said youre not allowed to judge me
thats not a judgment
thats just a fact
sometimes i withhold truth that is true
but its only because im scared to death of your crazy assed illogical overreactions
well it hurts me inside and triggers me that youre such a dishonest shit that youre lending your father money without telling me while your record company is going bankrupt
and were on the verge of losing our fucking house
charlotte plays piano in her room alone
through the wall she can hear debbie and pete fighting
what else are you lying about
ive taken viagra for two years

youre not happy
you dont like me
i can feel that
im not blind

theres no passion there
were not like brother and sister
you know what were like
were like simon and garfunkel and somehow you turned me into garfunkel
i dont even know what that means
whats wrong with art garfunkel
he has a beautiful voice
hes got an amazing voice
he could put a harmony to anything but what im saying is that you turned me into him
what the hell are you talking about
simon controls him
thats because simon writes the fucking songs
hes the better one
you know what
i see the way you look at our kids
you have so much love and compassion for them
you never look at me like that

pete doesnt say anything
debbie starts walking away

and youre putting them into your mouth
charlotte pokes sadie with her wet fingers
im going to kill you
she isnt hurting anyone
if you want to say something keep your mouth shut
you have never been nice to her and now shes getting aggressive with you

sadie leaves and slams her door
im sick of everybody fighting
charlotte writes a note at her desk
charlotte walks by sadies room
she puts the note up on the door
it reads im sorry you think im gross

pete sits alone listening to music
sadie sits alone watching lost on an ipad
debbie rests next to charlotte in bed
what do you think youre going to be like when you grow up

i dont want anyone to fight
i love you
pete is sleeping on the couch
pete sits at the counter
debbie and the kids are at the breakfast table
why isnt anybody talking
why is it so quiet
its the sounds of silence
pete is driving sadie and charlotte to school
on the stereo is paradise by the dashboard light by meatloaf
pete is eating an egg sandwich and manically singing along
singing i dont think that i can really survive
im praying for the end of time its all that i can do

pete and debbie are sitting across from vice principal laviani
in another seat is josephs mother catherine
joseph was very upset when i spoke to him about this so i thought it was important that we join together and work this through
were going to work through it but debbie told my son that he looked like tom petty in a negative way whos tom petty
you know who tom petty is
and she said that if she had to come back that she was going to f up his pussy ass
which is what she said
are you serious
i would never
to a child
your son has been defiling my daughters facebook page now for months
these people are liars
he said that my son was an animal and that if i didnt keep him on a leash that he would hit him with his car
did you say that
who talks like that
debbie tries to hide a smile
he didnt say that
he said it
what i said was that we need to keep an extra eye on our kids because with all the technological advances they need to learn to use them responsibly
he called me an icunt
how am i going to relay what these two nutballs said to me unless i say it
can you please not talk like that catherine
music man is rehearsing next door
sorry fucking music man
maybe if i looked more like this fake bullshit couple looks like theyre in a bank commercial
thats what you look like
like a bullshit bank commercial couple
none of this talk is productive
id like to rear up and jackknife my legs and kick you both in the jaw with my foot bone
youre just really scaring me
this is what happens when you corner a rat
you corner me i will chew through you
catherine youre better than this
fuck you jill
youre a horrible woman
this is why everybody hates you
this kind of shit
and im glad your husband died
because youre a fucking asshole
he probably killed himself
i think we know whats happening now
now you know what were dealing with
pete and debbie leave the school together surpressing smiles
they get in separate cars and drive off
debbie is making dinner
pete and charlotte sit at the table
im not going to eat that chicken
because i feel like im going to be a vegetarian
can you become a vegetarian tomorrow
sadie storms in
you guys have been reading my texts
no we havent
yes we have
were supposed to keep an eye on you
how did you find out
joseph told me that you flipped out on him and his mom and that you guys are nuts and i agree

youre the ones who are disrespectful
reading my texts is like reading my diary
you were really sweet on your ichat
we were really proud of you
yeah we were going to give you your computer and phone back

that is not how we talk to each other in this house
you guys talk to each other like that all the time
and to joseph and his mom
you made joseph cry
joseph has a crush on you
you like a boy who cries
shut up charlotte
you guys so desperately want me to be perfect and to make no mistakes
well you two are fucking insane

she walks off
shes becoming just like us
i hope i never get my period if this is what happens
sadie does her homework on her bed
charlotte brings in sadies electronics and puts them down in a pile beside her
where did you find these
i stole them
charlotte walks away and starts to slide the door closed behind her
no big deal
debbie is sitting on the couch
pete paces around the room
our kids are crazy
and its our fault
do you think theres anything we can do to turn it around
she might be a lost cause
where did she learn that kind of language
we dont talk like that
i have no fucking idea
do you think sadie is this crazy because of us
or is it hormones and lost
hes ruining our daughter
that fucking geek
i feel bad for us
all of a sudden were like a magnet for negativity
why do people keep attacking us
what did we do
were just doing our best
should we talk about our fight
i think were under enough pressure
lets just let it go this time
we can give each other a break
and im sorry about my dad
im sorry that hes just an endless mooch
beat the truth is this isnt about us
its about our parents
were not even mad at each other
were mad at them
lets just take away our parents power by loving them
can we do that
i kind of feel better already do you
i love you
i love you too
its not us its them
the shades are closed and the room is dark
sadie watches the end of the last episode of lost on a laptop

desi jumps in the pool in a small bikini
she is playing in the water with the kids
so thats the girl who works for you
yeah thats her
my wife would never let me have a hot employee like that
everyone that works for us looks like theyve been in some kind of horrible accident
angle on barb and debbie
youre comfortable with that around your husband
pete wouldnt know what to do with that
angle on barry and pete
you think our wives are looking at us right now
angle on barb and debbie
they look like pedophiles
barry and pete turn toward their wives smile and wave
pete greets guests including graham and grandma molly
pete and ronnie are talking in the backyard

the party is in full swing
pete debbie oliver barry and barb are getting food from the buffet
barb and barry are trying to help keep the conversation going
what do you do in chino oliver
i am a surgeon
wow what kind
mainly of the spine
my specialty is scoliosis surgery
my mom used to talk to me like i had scoliosis because im a little hunchy but thats a different thing
well you definitely dont look right
larry arrives with claire and the triplets
claire is holding two of them while larry carries one
the triplets now have very different haircuts so he can tell them apart
one has a faux hawk one has bangs and one has a buzz cut
im sorry were late
i was in the lab cloning myself
were going to have another seven more tomorrow
look we cut their hair different so we can finally tell who they are
larry lifts one of the triplets up and down by the arms simulating an elevator
you like the new haircut travis
im jack damn it
of course you are
larry puts jack down and he runs off
larry this is my father
how are you
can i have some more
please oliver i need a little morsel
i love that movie

id help honey but ive got the blood pressure and i dont want to
dad you want a drink
yeah a little white wine
okay heavy stuff
so who knew that debbie had a dad
where have you been for fifteen years

she supervises it yes
sadie charlotte and desi walk over
look how big the kids are
he gives desi a hug
to sadie hi sadie
who is oliver
what do you mean
is he your dad
he is my biological father
what does that mean
he and my mom had a baby and that was me
oh so youre our grandpa
why dont you ask your mother
yes well that would make him your grandpa
do you want him to be
then we get another grandpa
oliver gets up
charlotte sadie and desi run off
that was deeply uncomfortable
thank god the pretty girl was here to divert our attention
desi is gracefully swimming under water
she looks gorgeous
she sees jason and ronnie under water but they look grotesque red faced and awkward
they both reach for each other and come to the surface
i did not see you there
i saw you there
did you guys come together
are you a couple
no we didnt come together
sorry the mustache is a little thats fair
i just assumed
this is a straight man mustache
what is the different between a gay mans mustache and a straight mans mustache
desi swims away
larry is talking to oliver
so spinal surgery just seems to me to be at the top of the surgery chain
well were not cardio were not neuro but i like to think were an important part of the spectrum
do you operate every single day
multiple times a day
three four times
so whats the price range
like if i wanted oh id rather not say
its so big youre embarrassed to say
i wouldnt say embarrassed
are there hunchbacks today
ive never seen one
well thats because there are spinal surgeons
thats because of you
each time i dont see a hunchback youre getting that much richer
oliver smiles amused
you like the beatles dont you
who doesnt like the beatles
jason and ronnie are talking to desi
so whats your sun sign
thats not good
not for me thats not good
sexually we are completely incompatible
thats not true
thats such a shame
thats as bad as it gets
im a cancer
is that good
what does it mean
thats really strange
well taurus and cancers are sort of soul mates of the zodiac
were like perfectly compatible
i balance what you lack and you make up for what i lack
and a quiet cancer almost always has a huge penis
quietly youre making me embarrassed
debbie pete larry oliver barb and barry are eating
i wanted to make a toast
thank you guys so much for coming
petes turning forty
and were ready to start this new phase of our lives with open hearts
ready to just choose joy and forgive everybody so thank you all for coming
i think she just meant generally
put the past behind us
and live without resentments
but specifically who are you forgiving
i like to know the details before i toast
well you and my dad and others
i know you have some issues with me but im curious whats he in for
before today nobody even knew he existed
my parents divorced when i was really young and we dont spend that much time together and id like to work on that
just like wed like to work on how you have financial issues
to larry she means all the lending
and the borrowing
i know what she meant
ronnie jason and desi talk
you are a beautiful woman but you are not totally maxed out
i would say honestly youre a six
six and a half
i could make you an eleven
when i found deb she was a seven
and now shes a twelve
i want to be a twelve
you cant be lazy
i dont want to be lazy
look at me
you cannot be lazy
i wont be lazy
do you know how she got her body
bodies by jason
bodies by jason
say it again
bodies by jason
and now just say jason
that sounds right doesnt it
what the fuck is happening right now
when was the last time you two saw each other if you dont mind me asking
actually we had lunch together last week
and before that
its been about seven years
thats a joke right
thats like two olympics
and im the bad guy
what debbie doesnt understand is that its not bad to help out a parent
and its certainly not bad for a parent to help out a child
im sure oliver would agree
are you really doing this right now
am i doing what
i didnt start the toast
are you really about to hit up my dad for money
he does four operations a day
it helps everybody and it relieves his guilt from all the abandonment issues
you cant buy forgiveness right pete
i dont think anyones looking for handouts
wed pay him back
if you two are in a bind id be more than happy to help
its not good to borrow money from family members because it causes resentment remember
what do you want me to do
admit that my life is shit
is that what you want me to say
arent i allowed a little joy with these children i never wanted to have
you have never once stopped asking us for money
family helps family
family helps family
look i dont expect you to fully understand
your dad left
youre broken inside
its not your fault you cant feel love
theres something that you cant this is coming out wrong
you know what
i would rather have my dad than your dad because he doesnt drive me crazy
you know the best quality my father has
he asks for nothing
i dont know what the fuck hes thinking right now
look at that
i dont even know him
and i turned out perfectly fine without his input
i just figured out what your problem is
you hate jews
which is so odd because your children are jewish
dont play the jew card larry
im not playing any jew card
seriously its used up
you cant use up a jew card
thats the whole point of a jew card
you cant use it up it goes forever
you know what
i have to go
oliver gets up to leave
what a big surprise
see you later
see you in another seven years
make sure to say goodbye to the grandkids who you met today
you know nothing i do is right because of you
no matter how hard i try im just the asshole here but you know what i realized
youre the asshole
good luck working that out
happy birthday and go fuck yourself
oliver walks out
see you when the cubs win the pennant
im going to light the candles
get it going
maybe we should try the toast again
can you be quiet
to pete you just threw me under the bus
we agreed to let go and forgive but then you started ripping into my dad like a crazy person
im not ripping into your dad
im just saying to him what you say to me
dont be such a ball buster
i am not a ball buster
you make me one
i am a fun girl
i am fun loving
i am a good time sally
i dance hip hop
i cannot believe ive wasted my whole life busting the balls of people who have no balls
i am the only one here who has any balls
graham parker sings happy birthday to pete as charlotte accompanies him on a keyboard
the party is tense
debbie looks over and sees that oliver never actually left
he stands in the back looking uncomfortable quietly singing
shes shocked hes still there
debbie smokes a cigarette at the side of the house
debbie turns caught
what are you doing
in the front yard
no theyre barbs
she walks away towards the house
sadie storms through the front door after debbie
since when have you been a smoker
im not a smoker
debbie keeps walking down the hall
sadie follows her
i thought you said smokers die
i wasnt smoking
i saw you
barb is in the kitchen with pete and charlotte
mom youre smoking
deb you cant smoke youre pregnant
youve been doing so well
no f ing way
i dont want another sister
i dont want her as a sister
im so sorry
it just slipped out
debbie turns the corner to find pete standing in front of the fridge stress eating
mouth full of cupcake are you really pregnant
since when are you pregnant
since when do you care
you dont want another baby
you have no idea what i want
i want an asian baby
were not going to have an asian baby
yes we are
theyre not asian

shut up charlotte
you shut up
shut up sadie
shut up charlotte
shut up charlotte
okay stop saying shut up
since when are you pregnant
when did you find out
will you stop eating cupcakes please
stop eating cupcakes
stop eating cupcakes
debbie storms off back towards the foyer
larry pops out from the living room stopping debbie in the foyer
claire and the triplets are right behind him
we just heard
youre having a baby
see it can happen to anybody
that is so wonderful
were so happy for you
pete throws his cupcake against the wall
to charlotte this is too adult for you
lets go outside
larry and claire walk away as pete storms in
well i guess were stuck together forever then right
werent we always
you dont even want a baby
of course i do
i never said that
look i didnt want one if i could choose
i should put that on a hallmark card
oliver passes pete and turns to debbie as pete walks away
good luck with the pregnancy debbie
but please take care of yourself
its a much riskier pregnancy after forty
im not forty
of course you are
you were born on december th
how do you know
i was there
im the one who took your mother to the hospital
thats not what she said
your mom was in labor for only twenty minutes
it was like you couldnt wait to meet me can you imagine that
debbie is stunned
i dont even know you
you cant just come into my house and reminisce
walking out look maybe we were just not meant to be in each others lives
im not sure this was such a great idea
debbie follows him out the door and onto the front porch
she closes the door behind them
hey wait a minute
you did leave
and you didnt come back
getting agitated my first life was ruined
i did my best with my second
so i ruined your life
i was eight
people do better when i stay out of their lives
thats what my son tells me
you think my life is so perfect
ive got a thirteen year old whos a pot head ive got a wife whos keeping zoloft alive
you never said that before
you dont think i want to talk to you about this
to share it with you
its just not our way
we dont talk to each other we dont know each other
i thought thats the way you wanted it
how do i get out of this
how do i get you all to just help me down off the cross
debbie looks at him for a moment
you sound just like sadie
your daughter your younger
the big one
i know that
shes a wonderful girl
larry opens the door and peeks out
we reveal that everyone at the party except pete is still standing in the foyer
some of us need to leave
would this be a good moment to sneak out
from the side of the house we see pete storming by on his bike wearing his street clothes and a helmet
wheres dad going
pete exits his home riding his bike
he is very angry
he rides with great emotion like he is trying to get all the frustration out of his body
best birthday ever
pete rides his bike onto san vicente boulevard
pete rides down the street
a car passes by him
when it does a fifteen year old teenager sticks his head out the window and yells to scare pete
bike lane asshole
pete almost falls
fuck you you twilight pimply ass motherfuckers
debbie and barb are cleaning up
they look out the window to see oliver picking up glasses and putting them in a bin
your dads still here
where the hell is pete
sadie walks in with joseph
mom is it okay if joseph hangs out here for a while
do you want a piece of cake
oh yeah sure
sadie walks off
all right then
they are so cute
he looks exactly like tom petty
there is no bike lane and cars going very fast have to swerve to avoid pete
a car honks when traffic clogs up behind him
a car makes a right turn and pete almost rides right into it
he pulls up alongside jasons van
desi is riding with jason
they speed off
oliver and the kids are playing with an iphone
then you shake it
and then a restaurant comes up
debbie walks outside
im going to go look for pete
would you mind staying with the girls for just a little bit
shocked well if you want me to
if you dont mind
you dont have to
beat can i let sadie show me the last episode of lost
she asked me if id seen it i havent
that would be nice
to sadie she said we could watch it
sadie turns to charlotte puts her arm around her
im going to let you watch lost
charlotte smiles delighted to be accepted by her sister
is it scary
ill cover your eyes if it gets too scary
pete starts riding really fast and passes a car
when the car stops for a red he keeps going tears off to the left crosses four lanes of traffic in both directions and almost gets hit
pete rides his bike up a steep hill
he passes some other bikers almost hitting them
debbie drives around the neighborhood with larry in the passenger seat
are you mad at me
did i say something
pete flies down a steep hill going crazy fast
close up of his front wheel shaking
it is as if he wants to crash
he rides down the street when suddenly a man in a range rover opens his door to exit his car and pete slams directly into the mans car door hard
breaking the mans window and falling to the ground
the man is an incredibly thick fifty five year old
are you fucking kidding me
you opened your door on me
i didnt open my fucking door on you
i opened my door
pete slowly gets to his feet
i was right there
you are supposed to look before you open your door
i was in the fucking bike path
thats a blind spot
theres no fucking bike path
this is a residential section
get your head out of your ass
open your god damn eyes
what are you doing sleepwalking
youre supposed to look to see if a biker is coming through
youre supposed to look
its not my job to look out for you
you look out for yourself
i dont look out for you
i dont see you
i dont now where the fuck you are and what youre doing
no one is ever looking out for me
i need your name and number
because youre going to pay for my door
they drive near the scene of petes accident and overhear
why dont you pay for my bike and my face you fucking prick
the man punches pete in the face where hes already bleeding
debbie sees the punch and gasps realizing its pete
pete looks stunned
he punches the man in the gut to no effect
the man punches pete back in the stomach
pete sinks to the ground
dont disrespect me
debbie watches pete fall to the ground
she opens the car door and starts to run over toward him
are you sure thats him
i dont think thats him
as the man starts his engine debbie runs toward pete
in pain im going to write down your license plate number
the car drives away revealing that it is new and has dealers plates with no numbers
range rover of sunland
debbie reaches him and holds his head up
what are you doing
debbie and larry sit in the waiting area of the hospital
i guess the party didnt turn out like you planned
it wasnt a good party
a nurse walks over to them
ill bring you in as soon as his x rays are finished
is he okay
yeah he has a broken rib and hes been crying a little bit but hell be fine
the nurse walks away
you know pete was never a real fighter
but thats why he married you
thats why he loves you
because youre the fighter and you need that
one person in a relationship has got to punch
do you mean that in a good way
oh its a high compliment
listen i know what youre worried about
you think hes going to turn into me but i dont think its going to happen
hes smarter and probably a little cuter
a little less jewy
although after fifty thats all going to change
be prepared to wake up one day with a a rabbi
but the good news is hell love you forever
thats in our dna
we stick around
he worries about you
it puts a lot of pressure on him
i just dont have anyone else to talk to about it
you can talk to claire
if i open up to her shell leave me
no she wont larry she loves you
i know but theres a certain point at which you just cant stay
beat i guess its hard to forgive somebody if they dont formally apologize to you
are you apologizing
im very close
beat yes im sorry
and im glad everybodys okay
she hugs him and starts to cry a little bit
this is awkward
i need forty dollars for a cab
laughing thats funny
no im not kidding
you drove me
i wasnt prepared
i only have a hundred
ill bring you the change
he grabs the bill out of her purse and walks off
all right give him a kiss for me
oliver is sitting on the couch with charlotte and sadie watching the last scene of lost
joseph has joined them
i dont get it
see its not sad its happy because they helped each other achieve their destiny
im going to have some freaky ass nightmares
debbie walks into petes room sits on the bed next to him
i really liked our lives so much better before we tried to change everything
i dont want to keep anything from you
i love you
youre my wife
i just didnt want to let you down
are you mad that im pregnant
im not mad
you dont feel trapped
sometimes i feel like i trapped you
i dont feel trapped
you should because ive trapped you
you cant go anywhere
im going to get you pregnant every ten years for the rest of your life
you can never leave me
i never feel trapped by you
im so happy to be with you
i love you so much
youre my favorite person in the whole world
god damn it why am i crying like this
something is wrong with me
i was just outside telling your dad that i liked him
what if he thinks i like him now
no he wont think that
i dont want him to think i like him that much
itll never happen
suddenly giddy can you believe it
this is the craziest thing ever
what are we going to do with a third baby
i have no idea
how are we going to afford it
well sell the house
we dont have to
we kind of do
we kind of do
well make new memories in a new house
i love you
is there anything you want to do for your birthday
its been the worst birthday ever
there is one thing but i dont think youll like it
i wouldnt mind going to see some music
would you want to do that
i dont believe you but youre sweet for saying that
how do we break you out of here
i can just leave on my own volition
its not a mental institution
its not like one flew over the cuckoos nest
please dont put a pillow over my face
lets get out of here mcmurphy
you got it chief
will you carry me
as debbie helps pete off of the hospital bed pete kisses her passionately
pete and debbie watch ryan adams perform lucky now with his band
i like this song
why dont you sign him
no he wouldnt sign with me
youre the best
she smiles at him and he smiles back almost blushing
this is the smile he has been waiting for
well he is in between labels
lets go try and talk to him after the show
the camera pulls back as ryan adams finishes his song
