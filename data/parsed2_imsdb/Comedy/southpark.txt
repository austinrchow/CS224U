south park bigger longer and uncut by trey parker matt stone pam brady south park bigger longer and uncut by trey parker matt stone pam brady eighth draft january very
happy disneyesque music swirls in
pan down from a pretty blue sky to a small quaint town nestled in the hills
a wooden sign tells us this is south park
birds fly into the air townspeople smile to each other as they walk by
it is a scene reminiscent of if not directly ripped off from the opening number of beauty and the beast
a little eight year old boy walks happily down the street
he is stan marsh a noble looking boy with piercing blue eyes and a strong chin
as he walks he sings a happy song
im going to the movies to see the brighter side of life
im going to the movie everythings gonna be alright
forget all my troubles put my own life on hold let a studio tell me how i should view the world where everything works out i love it that way
im going to the movies the movies today
stan merrily walks up to a crappy looking house
we are in a young boys bedroom just as his alarm clock goes off
good morning south park
its five thirty a
time to feed the horses and water the cows
from the back we see the blond haired kid sit up from his bed
he stretches and then walks over to his closet
we still only see the boy from the back as he reaches in his closet and pulls out an orange coat
the kid puts his coat on then turns to camera and pulls the hood shut so that we never get a good look at his face
this boys name is kenny and under his orange coat we have no idea what he looks like except for his european nose and hazel eyes
mph rmph rm
kenny walks through his small dirty house and into the kitchen where his mother father and older brother are sitting at the humble table
sit down you can share some of your brothers waffle
the doorbell rings
kenny walks over to the door
kenny opens the door to find stan
the terrance and phillip movie is out
you wanna come
stan shows kenny a newspaper clipping
its an ad for the new terrance and phillip movie asses of fire
kennys eyes light up
mph rmph rm rmph
kenny walks away with stan
his mother comes out after him
wherere you going
mph mprh mprh rm
what do you mean you dont want to go to church
mrmph rmph rmph rm rmph
kenny and stan walk down the street
well fine go ahead and miss church
and then when you die and go to hell you can dramatic music sting
kenny stops thinks for a minute
and then walks off with stan anyway
stan and kenny now both happily march down the street to the happy beat
tom a plastic surgeon peeps his head out the door of his rhinoplasty office
say where are you boys going
were going to the movies
to see the brighter side of life
where everyone is beautiful and have their hair combed just right
mph rmph rm rmph rm
mph rm rmph rm
mprh rm rmph rm rm rmph rm rmph rm rmph

kenny and stan knock at the door
a handsome eight year old semite kyle answers the door
arent you supposed to go to church kenny
kyle check it out
kenny holds up the newspaper clipping
kyle slips on his coat and heads out the door
but just then kyles little brother ike a two year old adopted canadian boy bounces up next to him
you cant come with me
kyles mother a big fat bitch comes to the door and yells
kyle you take your little brother out to play with you
do as i say kyle
kyles mother closes the door
now the three boys and little ike merrily strut down the street and sing in unison
were going to the movies to see the better side of life where something interesting happens every day and night
in movies we can pretend that love is real and good always wins we can even make believe marriages last
a homeless guy is lying in the alley
spare a dollar
spare a dollar
stan walks by and throws a dollar at him
the homeless guy suddenly jumps up
im going to the movies
to see the brighter side of life
im going to the movies everythings gonna be alright
forget my troubles put my own life on hold let a studio tell me how to view the world
lets go get fat ass
this house looks just like all the others
close up on a bag that reads cheesy poofs
a hand reaches into the bag pulls out a wad of orange crunchies and raises them boom up to reveal the fat face of eight year old eric cartman who
chows down on the chips
now we see that fat little eric is sitting on his couch eating cheesy poofs and watching television
the doorbell rings
cartman doesnt move a muscle
cartmans mother enters
she is extremely june cleaveresque except that shes a hermaphrodite crack whore
she returns with stan kyle and kenny
look eric its your little friends
what the hell are you guys doing here
baba turtre bad
kyle holds up the newspaper ad
now all four boys are merrily walking down the street and singing
were going to the movies to see the better side of life
maybe therell be pirates
or a whole city burnin
maybe well see a monster or better yet uma thurman
were going to the movies
everythings gonna be okay
the boys skip out of frame
the movie theatre is nestled neatly between two other south park buildings
the boys walk up to the geeky teenage ticket guy
going to the movies
the movies today
can i get five tickets to terrance and phillip asses of fire please
suddenly all the happy music that has permeated the film comes to an abrupt halt
the boys look confused
whatdya mean no
terrance and phillip asses of fire is rated r
you kids cant get in
the boys look shocked
they just stand there in silence
the hell we cant
my money is just as good as any white persons
you have to be accompanied by a parent or guardian
because this movie has naughty language and it might make you kids start using bad words
listen you son of a bitch if you dont let us in to see this movie im gonna kick you square in the nuts
a few teenagers walk up to get their tickets
the boys step aside
this is terrible
this cant be happening

aw screw it
it probably isnt all that good anyway
what the hell are you talking about
you love terrance and philiip
yeah but the animations all crappy it probably cant sustain itself over ninety minutes
ive got an idea
the old homeless guy from the intro song walks up to the ticket guy with the boys
i want five tickets to terrance and phillip asses of fire
you realize this movie is rated r
it may not be appropriate for your little ones
turning to boys hey he says this movie isnt appropriate for you
whispering look homeless guy if you dont want to buy us tickets and not get your ten bucks and not go buy yourself a bottle of vodka and not forget
about how miserable your life is and not stop the voices in your head then go right ahead
five tickets please
the ticket guy suspiciously hands them over
the boys are all sitting in the front row
cartman has a huge tub of popcorn all kinds of candy and a large drink
be quiet ike
the movies starting
a title reads terrance and phillip asses of fire on the screen we come across phillip a very handsome canadian star with a great body
say terrance what did the spanish priest say to the uranian gynecologist
pan over to terrance who is also canadian and equally handsome in a more rugged way
i dont know phillip what
phillip rips a big fart
terrance and phillip laugh merrily
laughing their asses off

the boys walk away merrily
the ticket guy is in shock

all the children of south park are gathered at the pond for ice skating
the scene is reminiscent of the skating scene from the charlie brown christmas special
delicate snowflakes fall children laugh and skate and joyous music plays
the boys walk up to the pond
hey where have you guys been all day
we just went out to go see the terrance and phillip movie
all the kids gasp
dramatic music sting
you saw it
howd you get in
suddenly all the kids are gathered around the boys
theyre like celebrities
stop crowding us you shitfaced cockmasters
all the kids stop wide eyed
as if theyve just hear the voice of god
yeah youre all a bunch of ass ramming unclefuckers
to another kid we have to see this movie dude
the other kids nod
hey stan tell em about when terrance called phillip a testicle shitting rectal wart
but stan is elsewhere because out on the ice skating gracefully is little eight year old wendy testaburger
the heavens part a choir of angels sing as wendy skates around and around performing a series of impossible triple lutzes sowcows and what have you nots
all the animals of the forest deer birds bunnies all stop to admire her
stans smile grows wider and wider
kyle turns to see what hes looking at
thank my lucky stars here before me now is everything id ever hoped for knew it in a word saw it in a glance the only thing i think id
aw god damn it hes singing that fucking song again
spinning and soaring in slo mo
effortlessly covering every inch of the pond with her ballet maneuvers
stan is slack jawed
i cant stop now my hearts awake i pray her arms my arms to take so this is why im ali wendy finishes her routine with a triumphant hamill camel
landing right in front of stan and spraying ice in his face and abruptly ending his song
stan vomits profusely all over himself
just then another kid skates up spraying more ice in stans face
his name is gregory and he is a very handsome eight year old boy with golden hair and an open buttoned shirt
he speaks with a rich english accent
come wendy let us try to jump the hilly brush
stan looks at gregory
who are you kid
my name is gregory
i have been wendys counter cousin for some time
want to skate with us
weve been skating all morning
and laughing and talking of memories past
gregory skates away
stan looks stunned
finally he tries to get wendys attention
we saw the terrance and phillip movie
thats nice stan
wendy skates after gregory
stan looks completely rejected
woa dude whos your girlfriends new guy
shes not my girlfriend dude
meanwhile the schoolkids are all still gathered around cartman
yes i saw the terrance and phillip movie
who wants to touch me
i said who wants to touch me
a small boy steps forward and tentatively touches cartmans arm
establishing shot of the little town of south park which consists of four buildings
the sun rises in the background
its a brand new day
the elementary school is nestled peacefully between two mountain peaks
the kids of south park are all in their seats singing
shut your fucking face unclefucka
youre a shitsucking cocksucking unclefucka
the door opens and suddenly the kids quiet down
close up on a hand puppet with a large red hat
it seems to be speaking
okay children lets take our seats
as the voice continues we pull back to reveal that the puppet is on the right hand of mr
garrison a forty six year old teacher who is in denial about his homosexuality
we have a lot to learn and precious little time
garrison looks over the class and notices that every single one of them is wearing a terrance and phillip t shirt except of course for wendy
why is everyone wearing t shirts of sigfried and roy
its not sigried and roy mr
garrison its terrance and phillip
stan looks over at wendy
she just rolls her eyes
today children our friend mr
hat is going to tell us all about the environment
thats right mr
the environment is what surrounds us
it is what we live and breathe
i hate the environment
dude how can you hate the environment
cuz dude its all sticky and airy and fragile and stuff
i fucking hate it
the kids all gasp
did you just say the f word
no hes talking about fuck dude
you cant say fuck in front of mr
why the fuck not
dude you just said fuck again
if terrance and phillip can say something i should be able to say it too
wow cartmans cool
hes like terrance and phillip
cartman gloats proudly
fuckin a right
how would you like to go to the principals office
how would you like to gargle rat jiz
garrison is in shock
i said cartman takes out a megaphone hits the switch and puts it to his mouth
it feeds back horribly
through megaphone garrison is floored
oh dude we are fucked now
the boys are seated in front of the principals desk
now remember dont tell anybody we saw the terrance and phillip movie
yeah lets swear we wont tell
just then the principal walks in
she is principal victoria a frizzy haired woman of about forty
i am very disappointed in you boys
you should be ashamed of yourselves
ive already called in your parents but first i want you to think about what youve done
principal victoria can i ask a question
whats the big fucking deal
i want to know where you heard these horrific obscenities
the boys look at each other
ive heard them from mr
garrison a few times before
boys i seriously doubt that mr
garrison ever said reading eat penguin shit you cum sucking ass spelunker in school
the boys all laugh
but then the door opens and in walks stans mother kyles mother cartmans mother and kennys mother
thank you all for coming on such short notice
as you can see your boys are all being disciplined
this just isnt like you stanley
stan looks down at the floor
what did my son say principal victoria
did he say the s word
no it was worse than that
gasping the f word
heres a short list of the things theyve been saying
the mothers look over the sheet of paper
immediately their eyes bulge
oh dear god
what is fisting
thats when the fist is inserted into the anus or vagina for sexual pleasure
the two moms stare at ms
to kyle young man you will tell peincipal victoria this instant where you heard all these horrible phrases
i cant dude
we all took a sacred oath and swore ourselves to secrecy
it was the terrance and phllip movie
fuck you guys i wanna get out of here
terrance and phillip movie
what is terrance and phillip
terrance and phillip are two very untalented unfunny actors from canada
their tv show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage
now it appears they have a movie and im positive its not suitable for children
well it looks like ill have to send a warning letter out to parents
i have to put a stop to this before more children see terrance and phillip
everybodys already fucking seen it
i cant help it
that movie has warped my fragile little mind
alright boys thats enough
get out and let us adults speak
the boys get up and walk out
kyles mother slams the door behind them
we must take action on this immediately
i think well have to give detention to those boys
forgive me for saying so principal victoria but your methods are too
shall we say
as head of the pta i am exercising my right under article of the pta code
a look of shock comes over the principals face
you dont mean
yes principal victoria
the pta is impeaching you
but i you are officially relieved of your duties as principal of this school
kyles mother sits herself down at principal victorias desk
get out of that chair
the pta is in charge now
the other school kids are in line for lunch
just then the kyles mothers voice comes blaring through the p
we are now enforcing a new dress code at south park elementary
terrance and phillip shirts are no longer allowed in school
anyone wearing a terrance and phillip shirt is to be sent home immediately
the kids look down
theyre all wearing terrance and phillip shirts
the kids all cheer and run out the door
leaving the cafeteria absolutely empty
except for wendy
wendys hello echoes throughout the entire building
a dapper news anchor sits behind a news desk
all over america kids are flocking to the r rated film terrance and phillip asses of fire
here with a special report is a quadriplegic midget in a bikini
a quadriplegic midget in a bikini stands in front of the camera with a microphone
it appears that the effects of the canadian comedy are far reaching indeed
all over america children seem to be influenced
a teacher is on stage with a young spelling bee contestant
alright this is for the silver medal
oh fuck that why should i fucking have to spell forensics
all the kids cheer
here you go s u c k m y a s s a happy birthday party is going on is some kids backyard
a clown is entertaining everyone
hey kids how would you like to see some magic tricks
the clown looks startled
yeah and fuck your stupid little red nose
yeah and fuck your yellow hair
and fuck your gay pants
pan over to again find the midget reporter
he now has a graphic of a record chart next to him
and the devastating impact of the canadian phenomenon is terrance and phillips new hit song shut your fucking face unclefucka which has climbed the charts with a bullet we see
a clip from the video unclefucka
the video has terrance and phillip dressed like mase and puffy in that video they did in vegas
they wear shiny bright jumpsuits and lunge at the fish eye lens of the camera
singing shut your fucking face
the news anchor shakes his head in disgust
the controversy surrounding the terrance and phillip movie began in the small mountain town of south park colorado where the local pta banned the movie
with us tonight is the head of the south park pta sheila brofloski a screen appears with kyles mother looking very pissed
the title below her reads outraged mother
brovlofski how are these kids seeing this film
is bad parenting to blame
or is it canada
here with a counterpoint is the canadian minister of movies
a split screen appears kyles mother on one side and a goofy looking canadian slides into the other
thank you minister for joining us
thanks for having me buddy
minister parents all over america are concerned about your countrys entertainment
well the film is r rated and its not intended for children oh but of course children are going to see it
uh can i finish
can i finish
the fact is that we canadians are quite surprised by your outrage can i finish
can i finish
the united states has graphic images of violence on television all the time what is that one show
and car crashes caught on tape
we cant believe that a movie with some foul language and fart jokes would piss you off so much
can i finish
can i finish
okay im finished
but minister it isnt like this film is the first troublesome thing to come out of canada
let us not forget brian adams a few decades ago
the minister thinks
the canadians are just mad that we mothers here in south park have the chutzpah to stand up to them
like it or not mr
canadian minister our children are now safe from your canadian smut
the boys are in the front row this time with wendy watching the terrance and phillip movie
well terrance i hope you learned something from this whole experience
i did terrance i learned that you are a boner biting dick fart fuck face
the boys laugh merrily
wendy just looks bored
say phillip want to see the northern lights
you bet terrance
terrance pulls out a match lights it then farts
the flame burns terrance to a blackened mass
ha ha ha
you burned yourself to death by lighting the fart
ha ha ha
just a skull i sure did phillip
the boys laugh hysterically
did you see that wendy
the boys walk out happily
man that movie gets better every time i see it
yeah but you know what
that whole part about lighting farts is bullshit
you cant do that
mph rmpmh rm
didnt you think it was funny wendy
i think you and i need some time apart
its obvious that we dont have a whole lot in common anymore
i need somebody whos
a little deeper
but wendy i can go wendy places her little gloved hand over stans mouth
youll only make things more annoying
and just like that wendy is gone
stan looks almost ready to cry
kyle walks up behind stan
dude anybody who doesnt think terrance and phillip is funny can fuck off anyways
the boys walk off
mph rmph rm
no you cant kenny
mph rm rmph
okay kenny ill bet you a hundred dollars you cant light a fart on fire
kenny pulls out a book of matches
he strikes a match and holds it under his ass
after a few seconds kenny farts and there is a little flame
suddenly the flames catch and kenny starts burning alive
kenny runs around and finally falls to the ground still burning
cartman looks shocked
wow i guess you can do that
doctors and nurses are pushing kenny into the operating room er style
everything is quick and chaotic
shouts fill the hallway
cbc chem kit stat
its mid operation
siphon the fluid off his brain
another nurse hands him a sucker tube
he immediately shoves into kennys skull
it starts to slurp and burble
try to untangle his trachea and esophagus
while doctor gauche wrestles with kennys lungs and torso the nurse reaches into kennys mouth and pulls both his windpipe and esophagus out of his mouth turning them inside out
in the process
off to the side stan cartman and kyle look on as the doctor and nurses tangle themselves in knots with kennys innards
that doesnt go there
watch his liver
kennys liver pops out of his torso and slides across the floor
ill get it
we have precious little time left people
were going to lose him soon
suddenly there is a long beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep
doctor his hearts stopped
lets get it out of there
doctor gauche lifts kennys heart out of his body
we need to zap this quick
and runs it to the microwave
he opens the door
whos making a potato
my bad sir
i missed lunch
i am not going to lose this kid
fade up from black
were close on kennys face
his little eyes start to open
doctor gauche leans over him kenny
stan and kyle are there
kenny can you hear me
weakly mph rmph rm
how are you feeling son
son i have some bad news
we accidentally replaced your heart with a baked potato
you have about seven seconds to live
just then kennys baked potato heart explodes splattering gore all over the inside of the recovery room and on the outside of dr
gauche stan and kyle
oh my god
they killed kenny
it never gets any easier
anybody get the score of that broncos game
kyles mother is waiting with the rest of the parents
the nurse walks up to kennys parents with a sad expression
kennys mother breaks down
oh my god they killed kenny
i knew this would happen
those bastard canadians have now killed a child
cant people see the damage that film is doing
he was killed doing something he saw in the movie
it was terrance and phillip
they killed kenny
this is it
the time for action is now
singing something must be done
this is like a spreading rash
theyre pulling out our childrens brains and filling them with trash
cant you see what this is leading to
a world of smut and sex and poo
i believe the good fight has begun
something must be done
everyone gathers around kyles mother
singing something must be done
we must take action fast
my child used to say please and thank you now he says suck my ass
and my boy was the sweetest boy the world had ever known
until those damn canadians brought that filth into our home
i agree that there is now a battle to be won
we cant just stand here singing
something must be done
but what are we going to do against the media machine
its so big and powerful
and we can use that same media machine to exploit our cause
weve got to let the whole world know what the canadians did to your son
the parents all head out the door the doors to the hospital swing open and the parents march out into the street singing in unison as they go
singing something must be done
somethings gotta give
this world has become a bitch in which we have no desire to live
cars come screeching to a halt as the parents sing in the middle of the road
people start honking their horns in frustration
my boy could have become a doctor or a lawyer rich and true instead he burned up like a piggy on a bar b que
we will fight for childrens rights in memory of your son
we cant just stand here singing
something must be done
cars are now smashing into each other and flying off the road to peoples deaths as the music number has taken over the busy intersection
weve pushed and pushed it to the edge and now the time has come
somethings gotta change
its time to buy a gun
we cant just stand here singing no we cant just stand here singing no we cant just stand here singing
something must be done
a few more cars careen off and explode into flames as if ending the song with a borage of fireworks
the boys gather around kennys lifeless body
dazed i bet him he couldnt do it
i bet him a hundred dollars
come on cartman
its not your fault
no i know
im just fucking stoked i dont have to pay him
the boys walk out leaving kennys corpse behind
we can still hear the boys voices as they exit
i cant believe hes dead
yeah im having total deja vu right now
like this has all happened before
after they leave push in to kennys dead body which is left all alone on the operating table
the camera continues to zoom in to kennys face
zoom in on kennys dead face
we pass into his thoughs
kennys body is floating through a great void
a peaceful song plays as he soars upwards to the heavens
note except for kennys little construction paper body this entire sequence should be done in d cgi
ahead of him kenny can see a great white light
it appears warm and inviting
now kenny notices large beautiful breasts bobbing up and down in the heavens
he reaches out to touch them
kenny blissfully floats upward toward the bright light and bobbing breasts
the music crescendos as kenny gets almost close enough to the light to touch it
just then a huge electronic sign pops up
suddenly kenny goes spiraling downward
the song changes to a ministry type number as kennys surroundings start to become darker and more twisted
kennys hapless spirit enters a horrifying red tunnel filled with flames and heat
mph rmph rm
burning souls scream and cry all around kenny as his body plunges into what is now obviously the depths of hell
kenny passes images of hitler john wayne gacy hunger and disease as he continues through the twisting tunnel
he then passes images of jimmy stewart and gandhi
all of whom are opportunely locked in hell for all eternity
the same ticket guy from before is at the ticket booth
the marquee still reads terrance and phillip but a huge sticker has been placed over it that reads banned
the boys stand underneath the marquee looking baffled
how can they do this
it isnt fair
well terrance and phillip are on conan obrian tonight we could at least go watch that
the boys hang their heads and walks away
the ticket guy suddenly hears a bunch of commotion
he sees a mob of angry mothers led by kyles mother
this must be him officer
this is the scum that sold r rated tickets to children
jesus christ i didnt mean to
barbrady slaps handcuffs on the freaked out teen
you can explain downtown
getting dragged away oh shit
hey its not my fault
you should arrest those pervert canadians
oh we will mr
the boys are sitting on cartmans couch watching tv
conan comes back from a commercial break
sitting next to him is ms
our next guests have the number one movie in the world right now please welcome terrance and phillip
a few cheers as terrance and phillip walk out on stage
a few boos as well and we see that the south park mothers are in the audience holding anti terrance and phillip signs
terrance and phillip walk out and sit next to brooke shields
hello brooke shields
its nice to have you here in america
yeah well you being a canadian and all we thought what the hell
i understand you have a comedy routine worked out for us

phillip rips a fart that launches terrance backwards and into the band
they both laugh wildly
terrance and phillip laugh
nobody in the audience laughs
they laugh merrily
good one phillip
terrance extricates himself from the band
conan is growing nervous
he looks out into the audience
kyles mother is sitting there looking angry
conan makes eye contact with her and then nods his head
kyles mother nods back
nervous so guys i need to ask you a serious question
i just farted terrance back into the stone age
they both laugh hard
brooke shields waits a beat then belts out a fake laugh
i farted once on the set of blue lagoon
nobody cares brooke shields
terrance and phillip
whose idea was it to have a person lighting a fart on fire in your movie
who is responsible for that
terrance and phillip exhange glances
phillip i think our friend conan has been working too hard
it was your idea to have someone light a fart on fire in your movie
together it was our idea to have someone light a fart on fire in your movie
kyles mother is among them listening to all this
into her lapel thats it
move move move
a battalion of army guys appear seize terrance and phillip and arrest everyone in their group
terrance and phillip you are under arrest for working in america without the proper documents

conan obrian turns away ashamed

conan grabs his head

conan grabs a gun and blows his head off dousing brooke shields with blood
mondays at eight terrance and phillip laugh merrily
kyles mother cradles conans lifeless body

the boys are sitting on the couch in absolute shock
dude our moms arrested terrance and phillip
our moms suck

no more terrance and phillip ever
lots of foreigners with their silly foreign outfits sit at their stupid microphones with their ridiculous translation headsets in the general assembly hall
the canadian ambassador stands before them
as the canadian ambassador i hereby condemn the actions taken by america in apprehending terrance and phillip
a murmur goes through the crowd
we demand their release immediately
as you can see from this graph the entire economy of canada relies on terrance and phillip
without them we are doomed to recession
the united nations head bangs his gavel
now kyles mother stands up
she is with a group of mothers all wearing m
c t shirts

everyone looks at kyles mother
as president and founder of m
i would like to state excuse me m

this womans child was killed by your countrys humor
look how upset she is
kennys mom looks fine

more cheers from the americans
the canadians look worried

cartman storms out
the boys follow him
the boys walk into cartmans house
cartman slams the door behind him
the boys all walk toward the living room
come on you guys
we have to think
about cheesy poofs dumbass
this whole thing has gone too far
i dont really think you need cheesy poofs tubby but the boys come to an abrupt halt when they reach the living room and see that all four mothers are
waiting for them silently
everyone just sits there for a second
the lighting on kyles mothers face looks almost evil
boys we have to have a difficult discussion
we already know what you did
we saw it on television
yeah how come you arrested terrance and phillip
stanly youre too young to understand whats good for you
thats why we mothers have taken charge
but they fucking didnt do anything wrong
and what rim job expert went and outlawed cheesy poofs
the mothers all gasp in horror
what was that word young man
oh he said rim job
its when someone licks your ass for i know what it is
to his mother lick someones ass
the terrance and phillip movie has obviously done irreparable damage to their brains
we have to put them in rehab right away
you boys need help
there are rehab centers that specialize in treating people with chronic addictions to bad language
kyles mother thinks for a second
well no i guess not
but we will establish the first of its kind right here in south park
all the children in town will have to attend and receive treatment from the school counselor mr
ooh i just love when i get these sorts of ideas
so you can fuck up our life some more

brovlofski that way
im not fucking addicted to fucking bad language
i dont have a fucking problem
kenny walks through the black void of hell
a trippy single shaft of light seems to follow him wherever he goes
kenny continues on flames shoot up randomly from the ground scaring the shit out of him
suddenly kenny hears a clawing noise
it gets louder and louder
kenny starts to run faster and faster
now the clawing is right behind him
kenny spins around
he is face to face with satan
satan looks down at kenny and shoots flames out his nose
kennys eyes bulge open
we have such sights to show you
satan turns to a whispy form and flashes across the room like a serpent in a millisecond he is right up in kennys face
i am satan
i am your god now
kenny tries to run away but satan again changes form flies across the room and cuts kenny off
come with me
i will show you what delightful pain awaits
two black demons grab kenny by the arms and start to lead him away
just then saddam hussein show up next to satan
oh a new recruit huh
welcome to hell kid
take a load off
saddam hussein dont you
kennys eyes grow wide
establishing shot of the small betty fordesque building
the kids are sitting in chairs in a circle
there are anti drug signs on the walls crack is whack get high on pottery and i go from zero to bitch in
mackey the wiry school counselor leads the group
theres a pottery wheel and lots of craft tables behind them
mkay its come to my attention that you boys have a potty mouth problem mkay

mackey crosses to a piano
he plays chords while speaking the following lines
there are times when you get suckered in by drugs and alcohol and sex with wom en

mackey plays the piano and sings you can do it its all up to you mkay

everyone falls down laughing
kyles mom and the other moms watch the kids and mr
mackey rolling around on the floor laughing on a security monitor
what the hell do they think this is
just then kyles mother walks in with a scowling look interupting the kids and mr
mackey who are still laughing merrily
the other mothers are behind her
mackey what is going on
mackey stands up looking scared
uh were just starting our program
this is not a place for fun and games
this is rehabilitation
now get to it
we at mac have a trial to go to
the mothers walk away
god damn it your mom is a bitch kyle
kyle hangs his head
a news reporter stands in front of the supreme court
all around him are protestors with signs that say canada no
still others hold signs with kenny on them
tom im standing in front of the u
supreme court where the most important trial of the day is happening
thousands of people have shown up from all over the country to show their outrage and disgust at canada
joining me now is mrs
mckormick mother of the poor little boy who was killed by the canadians
kennys mother steps into frame
she is wearing a shirt with kennys picture on it
written on the t shirt is have you seen my son
no you havent
mckormick you must really hate the canadians
yes yes i do tom
did you ever think you would see the day when thousands of people were wearing your son kenny on t shirts
no i didnt
but if any of you would like one theyre
available in blue or white
the reporter thinks for a second and then turns back to the camera
well we can only imagine the intense vehement trial that is going on inside
terrance and phillip are on the stand
terrance and phillip
you knowingly with malice of forethought were trying to destroy american culture yes or no
terrance rips a fart
the kids are all in the main room sitting on a couch huddled around a television
they laugh merrily
mackeys gonna hear us
the americans are just showing their true colors as smelly bastards
fight the power
the young boy that died lit himself on fire
it was unfortunate but how can they blame us
dont believe the hype
terrance and phillip laugh merrily
the kids all shout agreement
terrance and phillip laugh merrily
you cannot oppress us
we will continue to pursue our art
we know there are americans out there who will help us
kyles mother now stands up from the prosecutors table
your art is shallow and immature
we americans do not allow that for our children
you teach your children that america is the land of the free
but its all bullshit
youre one of the most conservative countries in the world
the children all listen wide eyed
the problem is you dont allow your children to think for themselves
you try to raise them in a protective bubble and then when they finally get old enough they realize theyve been lied to and they resent you for it
yeah god no wonder your country is so fucked up
wake up america
your government censors you from the world
suddenly the screen goes blank
a sign that says please stand by comes on
the kids all watch wide eyed
the station conveniently went blank
the canadian prime minister stands directly in front of camera looking right at us
you have taken our national treasure terrance and phillip
we in turn have taken yours
the smothers brothers
the canadian prime minister steps out of the way revealing the smothers brothers tied up in chairs behind him
ill let you catch your breath
now release terrance and phillip or else we will execute your beloved smothers brothers
please listen to them
theyre not fucking around
were not fucking around
this is not aboot deals
this aboot dignity
this is aboot freedom
this is aboot respect
return terrance and phillip now
another canadian leans in and whispers in the prime ministers ear
and fuck you america
he raises his middle finger but its all blurred and digitized
okay kids for todays rehabilitation activity were going to watch the terrance and phillip movie
now this is an edited version of the movie which was put out by the mpaa
thats the motion picture association of america
isnt that censorship
no the mpaa is not a censorship group
because they say so
now i want you to watch this movie with all the immature profanity taken out and notice how much better a movie it becomes
mackey puts the tape in and hits play
the titles come up terrance and phillip asses of fire except that asses has been blurred out and replaced with bunz
the movie begins
phillip walks in
but it isnt phillips voice somebody has dubbed him over
i feel like im going to pass gas near your head
i would rather you didnt phillip
is that so
phillip farts on terrance
oh you are such a maroon
you would know dummy
the boys look confused
you are pigeon like in your intelligence
the pseudo terrance and phillip laugh
terrance throws a match on phillip and phillip burns to death
a title comes up the end
and the credits roll
dude they cut out minutes
the lights in the theater come up
so you see the point and the theme of the film is kept intact
and of course the mpaa didnt cut out any of the graphic violence
what did you think
oh man im gonna need a cherry pie to get the taste of ass out of my mouth from that piece of shit movie
eric youre not watching your mouth
you get me cheesy poofs with the delightful cheddar crunch and ill watch my fucking mouth

mackey slaps his hand over his mouth and looks around scared
ha ha you stupid asshole prickfuck
mackey is in a private office with the members of m
how is the childrens progress
most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths
what do you mean most why not all
nervous well some of the children just dont respond to step programs
then well have to resort to plan b and call the v chip organization
dramatic music sting
mackey looks afraid
brovlofski the v chip hasnt been fully tested yet it could be dangerous
evil i dont care if its dangerous
desperate times call for desperate measures mr
perhaps i need to remind you of your situation
nervous alright ill make the call
the kids are again glued to the tv watching the trial of terrance and phillip
back in the courthouse the jury walks in and sits down
madam foreman have you reached a verdict
we have your honor
how find you the jury

terrance and phillip

the crowd goes wild
the mothers of m

the judge bangs her gavel

phillip passes out
the kids cant believe what theyre seeing
everyone is silent

the boys sit there and blink

proudly were protesting
well boys it might interest you to know that your friends the canadians have just bombed the u
yes at six this morning they bombed the heck out of cleveland
that doesnt count

wendy mkay if you want to start getting political ill throw your skinny little butt right back into rehab
im afraid its phase two for you
dramatic music sting
kenny is chained up in a torture chamber in hell
demons and ghouls surround him

kenny starts to cry
saddam hussein comes out from behind satan holding a martini

saddam pulls satan around and plants a big wet kiss on him

a large crowd of parents has gathered for a pta meeting
kennys mother is at a table selling dead kenny t shirts
she has a shitload of money all around her
another mother walks up hands kennys mom money and gets a shirt
is that a new pearl bracelet mrs
yes it is
meanwhile kyles mother is on the stand
as our next official order of business here at m
we will test the new v chip
as most of you know the v chip was created to lock children out of watching certain shows on television
and now the n
has created a new exciting product that they can tell us all about
here is the surgeon general dr
doctor pangloss a lab technician in white takes the podium
thank you parents
one person claps
pangloss hits a button and a slide projector starts showing pictures of the device
the machinery of the new v chip is very simple and similar to that of the v chip
the chip is placed just under the subjects skin where it emits a small but painful shock of electricity whenever an obscenity is uttered
the parents are fascinated
now wait a minute are you telling us that this chip somehow knows if the kid is swearing
its just like a lie detector
certain things happen in you when you swear just like when you lie the chip picks up on this and gives the subject a shock
the parents ad lib ooohs and ahhhhs we are very excited to see the results of this test
calling patient would you step out here please
cartman steps out wearing a hospital gown
patient here has been fitted with the new v chip
my head hurts
dont worry about that
now i want you to say doggy
notice that nothing happens

cartman looks offstage to his mother
go ahead its alright eric
horsefuck cartman falls to the floor in pain
all the parents ooh and ahh and applaud
that hurt god dammi success
our device works perfectly
we will begin mass production immediately
and so we have succesfully removed the canadian smut from all of our childrens brains
we have made changes at school to ensure that our kids are never again exposed to smut
the crowd goes wild
school is now naziesque
a military drum echoes in the distance
stan and kyle are sitting in their desks waiting for school to begin
wendy walks by on her way to her desk
not even looking hi stan
wendy walks on by
wendy could really give a rats ass about you
eyes still on wendy i bet she would if my name was gregory

dude here comes cartman
cartman walks in and gingerly sits down
hey cartman did they put that v chip in your head or your ass

stan and kyle laugh
very funny dickhead bzzaat
the v chip shocks cartman
cartman is thrown to the floor in a shivering heap
what the hell was that

stan and kyle look at each other
you know me and stan were just talking about what a fat fucking hunk o fat fuck you are

this is sweet
garrison stands before his class

the kids all just sit there
come on children do be shy just give it your best shot
clyde raises his hand
okay now lets try to get an answer from somebody whos not a complete retard

just then the door bursts open and in walks a couple of nazi looking american soldiers
they walk over to the children and start pulling off their free terrance and phillip pins
hey what are you doing
you cant wear these in school
its against school policy thank you
another solider rips off kyles pin and replaces it with a yellow star

all the elementary students are gathered in front of a large television monitor
garrison and his class walk in and look confused
the boys walk up to chef
please take your seats everyone
they all go to their seats
whats going on chef
something big children
the television goes from that emergency broadcast signal to a scene of a news anchor sitting at his desk
very serious this is a state of emergency
we go now to the white house for a very important announcement from the president of the united states
the president is sitting in a chair by the fireplace
ladies and gentlemen
at five a
today a day which will live in infamy
has declared war on canada
they all stare in silence
garrison takes a deep breath
i dont believe it
holy crap ow
hey crap isnt a swear word what the fuck
all canadians are to leave the country immediately or be subject to military camps
all canadian products are to be thrown out
how can they do this
i never thought there would be war again in my lifetime
do not be afraid of this war
instead embrace it
we have god on our side
and besides theyre just canadians what the hell are they gonna do
everyone watches the television in stunned silence
chef what does it mean that were at war
its not good children
what do we do
do we go on as normal or
i dont know principal victoria

and now i would like to bring up the woman who led and is still leading the way in this glorious stand pointing to tv kyles mom appears on the
tv dressed in military garb
isnt that your mother kyle
kyle cant believe it
on the television kyles mother walks up to the podium
she is dressed to the hilt
she hugs the president and the first lady and then takes a deep breath
my fellow americans
i have led this fight in the war against profanity
i have founded mothers against canada
our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time
as commander in chief i have ordered our army to set up defensive positions along the us canada border in anticipation of an attack
what about air strikes
we have to have air strikes on their military and entertainment centers
its the only way to ensure that their smut cant reach american soil
i dont know if air strikes are necessary
president may i remind you that our countrys heart and soul are at stake and our childrens minds are the battlefield
the bastard canadians want to fight us because we wont tolerate their potty mouths
well if it is war they want
a huge eruption of cheers from the crowd in front of kyles mother
she is obviously floored by it
she cant help but smile
she actually holds her head up higher and then raises her arms up in two peace signs as the cheers get louder
the president forces a smile and actually applauds with the rest of the crowd
back in the gymnasium kyle looks thoroughly embarrassed
damn your moms a bitch kyle
amen to that
kenny is sadly walking around hell
he walks up to another one of hells prisoners
mph rmph rm rmph rm
why the hell would i have proofs of purchases from snacky smores
beat it kid
kenny moves along
he hears some voices coming from a door
kenny opens the door and peeps inside saddam and satan are lying in bed
you just get cranky when youre tired thats all
i told you that you shouldnt have tried to carry that futon all by yourself
im not cranky
and that futon was not too big to carry myself just then satan hears a reporter on cnn
in war news countries from europe and asia are joining sides in the canadian american war listen butterbuns lets make love and forget about the whole thing the death count
is already on its way to million with no signs of slowing down
what started as a spat between the united states and canada is quickly turning into world war iii kennys eyes bulge he wants to see more but satan clicks off
the television and sits up in bed
it has come to be
the four horsemen are drawing nigh
the time of the prophecy is upon us
oh i love when you get all biblical satan
you know exactly how to turn my crank
no im being serious
those canadian entertainers are to be killed
it is the seventh sign
satan walks over to large pedestal which holds an ancient tome
satan turns the pages as he talks
behold the signs of my reign on earth are all falling into place
the fall of an empire he points to an ancient looking picture of the death of ceasar
the coming of a comet he points to a picture of a comet passing by earth
jerry springers movie doing more than ten million box office a picture of jerry springer holding a bunch of money
satan points to an ancient drawing on the wall
it looks like terrance and phillip being stabbed in the head
the seventh sign
when the blood of these canadians touches american soil
it will be my time to rise
man im getting so hot
do you always think about sex
im talking about some very important stuff here
listen buttercup lets make love and forget about the whole thing
is sex the only thing that matters to you
saddam thinks for a second
i love you
satan sits with his arms crossed and a frown
you know i do
so what do you say we shut off that light and get close huh
satan reaches over and turns off the light
everything goes pitch black
the light goes off of kennys face as well
then a small moan from satan
yeah you like that dont you bitch
stan and kyle are walking down south park avenue
stan is reading out of a huge book
does it say what the clitoris is
all it says is that its above the vulva
but where the hell is the vulva
isnt that in arizona or something
stan and kyle walk into the middle of town where a huge bonfire of terrance and phillip videos posters and canadian items like syrup and hockey sticks are burning away
the soldiers throw stans book on top of the pile and it starts to burn
stan and kyle walk up to where cartman is standing
what is this
theyre burning all the canadian stuff cause of the war
that book wasnt canadian
clyde one of the kids from school throws his terrance and phillip dolls into the burning mass
kyle stops him on his way back
dude dont you like terrance and phillip anymore

my daddy says i hate canadians now
more kids line up to burn their terrance and phillip stuff
several random mothers from m
are standing in front of the bonfire with anti canadian signs and t shirts
the boys parents arent around but another mac mother is leading the charge
a townsperson throws alanis morisette albums into the fire
another townsperson runs up and throws in a bag of cheesy poofs
cartman falls to his knees and cries as the cheesy poofs burn away
this is all cause of your mom kyle

kyle picks his brother up and tries to protect him
well you better get his beady eyed canadian ass out of america before my daddy finds him
the boys watch in horror as the fifth graders run over and throw more canadian items into the fire
its only a matter of time before my mom has him burned too

dramatic music begins

a world of chains and ties and glue

the door to the attic pops open
kyle shoves ike up into the attic

goodnight ike were all going to bed
the door closes and it is dark
he looks out a small window onto the street below
a few armed soldiers walk by
ike pulls out a little plastic harmonica and sadly starts to play
tons of military personnel are running to and fro
giant computer screens show canadas latest attacks
the canadians have destroyed des moines
how can you tell
everyone laughs merrily
good one sir
suddenly a pentagon guy runs up to the president holding some papers
sir were tracking a signal crossing into canadian computers
it looks like we may have a resistance movement starting
the president grabs the papers and dashes over to kyles mother who is standing there looking smug with her arms behind her back and her chest out
she has a few military badges on her
showing her the papers maam were tracking a resistance
its probably canadian spies
well find out where that signal is coming from
then hunt them down like dogs
any and all canadian influence must be stopped at all cost
the president starts to run off
im needing lunch
right away maam
the president runs off
and so the draft will begin tomorrow as more and more troops are needed to fight the canadian forces
cartmans mother is tucking him into bed
what is quickly being referred to as the great canadian american war has already reached a death toll of two million
cartmans mother reaches over and switches off the radio
when is the war gonna be over
i dont know honey
soon we hope
you want it to end quickly huh
oh i dont care i was just asking cuz all my favorite tv shows have been replaced by news and its pissing me off
with that cartmans mother gets up mom
if you went down on a horse
youd tell me right
she switches off the light and leaves
cartman lies there lit only by soft blue moonlight and thinks
he hears a scraping noise and looks a little scared but then tries to close his eyes to sleep
go away scary noise
again the scraping
cartman pops open hs eyes to see kenny
he is transparent and floating above cartmans bed
cartman is horrified
too much so to even scream
kenny puts his hands to his mouth to try and speak but he makes no sound
finally cartman lets out a piercing cry
cartmans mother comes running in just as the image of kenny disappears
eric what is it
i saw him
i saw kenny
cartmans mother looks around and sees nothing
finally she just cradles cartmans fat head in her arms
oh you poor dear
youve been through so much
i bet him he couldnt set himself on fire and now hes all pissed off
i cant say pissed off
kenny is again snooping around
he quietly creaks satans door open and walks in
satan is in his room looking at a map of earth
the execution of terrance and phillip is imminent soon all hell shall rise
kenny looks scared
evil and scary are you afraid little one
afraid for the souls of your pitiful friends that suddenly saddam walks in carrying some bags
i got some great new home furnishings today
satan rolls his eyes and sighs
his attempt to be evil to kenny is squashed again
boy buddy rich it was a bitch to get something to match with that bathroom tile
saddam looks at kenny
oh hey kid
find those proofs of purchases yet
gee whatta surprise
well keep lookin
satan folds his arms and looks at the floor pissed
do you wanna know what did today
saddam lets out a sigh
what did you do today satan
you dont care
this whole armageddon thing has got you all stressed out
lets make love
do you remember when you first got here
we used to talk all night long
until the sun came up
we would just lie in bed and talk
thats because i wanted to fuck you dumbass
now hows aboot you get those pants down
dont call me dumb
i mean cute dumb
now bend over
as this conversation happens kennys eyes dart back and forth as if watching a tennis match
how come you always want to make love to me from behind
is it because you want to pretend im somebody else
satan your ass is gigantic and red who am i gonna pretend you are
come on kid
help me with these shower curtains
saddam and kenny walk out
leaving satan all alone with sad music playing
gently sometimes i think when i look up real high that theres a whole world up there and just maybe it could be mine but then i sink because its
here im supposed to stay but i dont even know how or why its supposed to be that way satan walks to his veranda
up there there is so much room where babies burp and flowers bloom everyone dreams i can dream too up there up where the skies are ocean blue i could
be safe and live without a care
up there satan walks over to a bright blue globe and spins it slowly
they say i dont belong that my place is down below because of my beliefs im supposed to stay where evil is sewn but what is evil anyway
is there reason to the rhyme
without evil there could be no good so it must be good to be evil sometimes up there there is so much room where babies burp and flowers bloom
everyone dreams i can dream too up there up where the skies are ocean blue i could be safe and life without a care
up there pull back big crane shot rising above satan
a dim light is all that is visible from inside the small building
stan and kyle are painting a sign on the wall la resistance
cartman comes running in he looks scared
youre late cartman
i had to ride my bike here
my behind is killing me
i have to say behind
i get shocked if i say ass did you bring the pie and punch
no you guys
you guys wanna hear something creepy
looking over each shoulder i dont think kenny is dead
i saw him last night
i know cartman i know
i see kenny every day
on the face of every child on the smile of every baby
kyle and stan laugh again
im telling you this was kenny
i think hes haunting me
the boys all look scared
the boys walk over to the door and open the sliding panel in front of their eyes
who is it
im here for la resistance
whats the password
i dont know
kyle opens the door
the golden haired young boy from rehab stands there looking handsome and angelic
viva la resistance
oh no its that kid
this is the place another kid walks up next to gregory its wendy
stans eyes grow wide
you started la resistance
well apparently you have a bigger heart than we thought
let us get this meeting underway there are others coming
gregory takes wendys hand and pushes his way in
now the room is filled with a bunch of scared looking resistance followers
all of whom are under the age of twelve
the room is lit only by candlelight
and the large viva la resistance banner hands on the wall
stan and kyle look nervous
everyone be seated please
the kids all sit down
wow a lot of people showed up
yeah so what do we say
i thought you had something planned
stan looks out over the faces
gregory checks his watch
terrance and phillip are supposed to be killed and we think that sucks ass
the kids dont respond
stan shoots a nervous look at wendy who is sitting next to gregory
so we think we should prank call a bunch of policemen
we can have pizzas sent to them that they didnt order
viva again no response
gregory rolls his eyes
gregory stands up
gregory takes stans place at the front of the group
terrance and phillip are currently being held at a canadian internment camp two kilometers outside of town
they are to be executed tomorrow during a star studded uso show for the troops
gregory pulls a big map out of nowhere and rolls it out
stan and kyle cant believe it
we must sneak into the camp through this duct freeing terrance and phillip inside
the war is escalating and the american forces are preparing for a large scale attack on canada
that means the time is now
wow dude wendys new guy is smart
stan shoots kyle a dirty look
this is a dangerous mission so ill go myself
wendy smiles at gregory
everyone looks at stan
we started la resistance to save terrance and phillip
this will be very dangerous
are you quite sure
lets run through the plan
a huge hall is filled with hundreds of soldiers in different battalions
we see our regulars mr
garrison with a uniformed mr
mackey jimbo and ned bo pip stans grandfather jesus officer barbrady
oh im so glad theres a war again
i was gettin worried id never see another one
i know what you mean
and theyre giving all us troops a big uso tomorrow with celebrities and executions
pan over to mr
you look great in your new uniform mr
you do too mr
boy i cant wait for our first shore leave so i can go get me some poontang
chef sits down in a seat behind garrison near the back
general plymkin a gruff old army type with bug eyes steps up to a podium and addresses the troops
the crowd settles down
its no secret that the evil canadian federation has scored major victories all over the united state
we have brought you here because you ar americas best and last hope
another general leans over to plymkin and whispers in his ear
apparently youre not the best youre simply the last
anyway lets strategize
a large holographic d map of south park springs up in front of him
he walks around it pointing out things with a laser pointer
our sources have told us that the canadians might try to attach tomorrows uso show and stop us from executing terrance and phillip
he points to a spot on the d map
now each battalion has a specific code name and mission
battalion raise your hands chef is in battalion and dutifully raises his hand
then he looks around and notices to his surprise that everybody else in his section is also african american
you will be the all important first defense wave which we will call operation human shield
hey wait a minute
now keep in mind operation human shield will suffer heavy losses
but dont lose your spirit men
stay until the bitter end
a bunch of white guys raise their hands
right you are operation get behind the darkies
you will follow battalion here he points to a spot on the d map
and try not to get killed for gods sake
are there any questions men
chef raises his hand
have you ever heard of the emancipation proclamation
i dont listen to hip hop
if you somehow live we will regroup on this hill outside suddenly the d hologram starts to flicker and fizzle
now whats wrong with this thing
general plymkin messes with the controls
general plymkin has pulled the plug
he stands there with the cord in his hands
bill gates walks in escorted by two military guards
it is faster over five million plymkin pulls out a gun and shoots him in the head
gates falls to the floor dead
alright men get lots of rest and prepare thyselves for battle
in the dead of night the kids are all in a circle discussing the plan
after you clear this zone here rendezvous behind this ridge where terrance and phillip should be held
you are indeed brave but you will need someone whos done this sort of thing before
suddenly a bump in the ground starts to move forward leaving a trail behind it
like bugs bunny before he pops out the bump comes to a stop at the childrens feet and out pops the mole
he is a very bitter little nine year old french kid with a thick french accent
thank you for coming mole
we must free more canadian prizoners
yeah i guess
she iz a beetch that sheets on her own children
stan and kyle look at each other confused
this is the mole
he will accompany you to the prison where terrance and phillip are
he is an expert in covert operations and a lifelong fighter for freedom
its like cows urine poured down your troat
you wonder do i want this
but its urine
everyone stares at the mole
good luck stan ill make sure wendy is
stan gets pissed
give me terrance and phillip or give me death
now gregory breaks into song
his voice is absolutely gorgeous and deep
he puts his hand on stans shoulder
god has smiled upon you this day the fate of a nation in your hands
stan and kyle look at each other
they cant believe how good this guys voice is
wendy appears enthralled
as brothers and sisters we unite and behind you we shall fight
until only the most righteous belief stands
the music builds
gregory gets up on a soapbox
do you see the distant flames
they bellow in the night fight in all our names for what we know is right and if you all get shot and cannot carry on though you die la
resistance lives on
kyle and the boys look a little worried as other kids join in the song
you might get stabbed in the head by a dagger or a sword you might be burned to death or skinned alive or worse
but when they torture you you will not feel a need to run for though you die la resistance lives on
do you hear the beating drum
it is our hearts all joined to one it is the music of our souls knowing we have much to overcome
as the song continues we the mac mothers are on a stage preparing two electric chairs
something must be done
tomorrow it will be
were going to execute this threat to our democracy
all the mothers join in as they decorate the chairs with american flags
kennys mother is counting money she has made from selling t shirts
and after that our kids will be safe from all the canadian scum
the time is now the time is here tomorrow something will be done
the song still continues as we satan stands on his veranda
i want to be part of that world
but if only i had the strength to go without him
if only i had the strength to leave him behind
get on with my life in that world
start over as part of that world
the soldiers including garrison mackey ned and jimbo are in their bunks
tomorrow we face our destiny
tomorrow we fight to keep our country free
death to canada
death to them all
like our forefathers we shall answer the call
pan down to chefs bunk where he is lying naked with a hot chick
as usual chef sings a song that has absolutely no relevance to whats going on
stroking womans arm baby your thighs sparkle like diamonds baby your butt is tender like the night i can see by the look in your pants that you want to
treat me right
ill whisper sweet nothings in your cleavage and you can kiss me gently with your tongue and ill make love to you so deeply that youll feel pressure clear up
to your lungs
meanwhile the soldiers continue their song
something must be done
somethings gotta give
tomorrow we will be free or we will no longer live
terrance and phillip are chained to the wall in a dark dirty prison cell
two armed american soldiers are torturing terrance and phillip with hot irons as terrance and phillip sing shut your fucking face unclefucka
youre an ass raping cock sucking unclefucka
the kids are all gathered together finishing their song
one kid grabs a large flag and starts swirling it around
let it echo through the night
let it reach the ears of everyone
though we die la resistance lives on
though we die la resistance lives onnnn
all the south park men are in the rank and file marching down the street
singing i dont know but ive been told they pass kyles house
ike watches the soldiers march from his little attic window
canadian pussy is mighty cold
does he understand them
he picks up a small book and starts to write in it
satan paces back and forth in hell
this is it
world war three is at hand
the millennium nears
satan crosses to one of his small demons
prepare the minions for the rising of gothos
the demon dashes off
this is so exciting
satan sighs and bows his head
this is the millennium saddam
this is armageddon
theres more to life than sex
hey relax guy

saddam finishes the song and satanhangs his head

satan looks about to cry but then notices kenny still standing there

mph rmph rm rmph rm
what do you mean
i could leave him if i wanted to
rmph rm rmph rm
satan lowers his head
slowly he starts to cry
kenny walks over and pats him on the back
tents and makeshift buildings are lined up against the mountains
jeeps and tanks buzz to and fro
theres a huge stage which is set up with thousands of seats
theres a giant banner reading uso show tonight
loads of soldiers file into their seats
alright you men
the uso show is about to start
the military men go wild
get ready for loads of entertainment and fabulous celebrities
to be followed immediately by the swift and nasty execution of terrance and elroy
the crowd goes crazy again
right out of nazi germany
barbed wire guards the whole bit
they are on their backs shimmying along the ground underneath the blanket of razor wire that is set up around the camp
the mole uses the bolt cutters to cut the wire as he goes clearing a path for stan kyle and cartman
be careful not to touch this wire a wire catches on cartmans arm and snaps against his face
stan shoves his hand over cartmans mouth leaving cartman to cuss bloody murder into stans glove
finally they clear the fence and lie down in view of the camp
it sounds like the uso show has started
we have precious little time
kyle looks at the horrible concentration camp
oh my god
let me tell you something about god
he is ze biggest bitch of zem all
kyle looks at the mole oddly
how are we ever gonna find them
the mole whips out some night vision goggles
the mole inspects the camp
he sees a guard on a guard tower
then he pans over to a bunch of canadians standing in a line in rags
the mole quickly clicks the magnification to high so we see the saddened faces of the canadians
do you see them
do you see terrance and phillip
zey must have zem inside
we will have to dig
thats gonna take a long time
did time matter to the revolutionists who were forced to eat their own shit while dying in the dungeons of ze king
the boys think
helicopters zoom over the makeshift stage like the uso show in apocalypse now
groups of soldiers cheer as a helicopter approaches the landing platform and touches down
the us army men cheer
the mothers take the stage and kyles mother speaks into the microphone
behind her is a huge american flag
she is wearing an army helmet
this is right out of patton
ladies and gentlemen of the american war effort we salute you
a big cheer goes through the crowd
kyles mother feels the power and lifts her head high
she starts to pace back and forth on the stage as she speaks becoming more and more pattonlike
tomorrow you will be risking your lives so that our children will have a better future
god bless you men
and god bless this filth free nation
many of you will die
die like blood bathed pigs
so tonight we at mac present a night of a hundred stars
now without further ado i give you
out of the helicopter emerge a battalion of the best and brightest stars that the american show biz industry has to offer
pint size pixie and darling of the indie movie scene winona ryder
she gestures grandly to the helicopter where winona ryder emerges and runs to center stage and waves to the audience
she looks like a strung out coke addict because she is
s winona ryder
one guy claps
i want you all to know im super psyched to be here today

she cues the band which has been assembled from the same helicopter
jazz music starts up
its new york new york
the troops look confused
you know what im gonna do for you now dont you
new york new york continues to play
singing the bells are ringin for me and my gal
the birds are singin for me and my gal
the mole is digging frantically while the boys follow on all fours
cartman holds a flashlight
dude this is seriously lame
i didnt know we were gonna get all dirty and stuff
what is it
i cannot dig any further in zis direction
were going to die here like baby mice who have had no milk in days
dry up into crunchy little pinkies
the boys stare
or we can dig up
the mole starts digging up towards the ground
mole pops his head out of the ground
immediately a search light passes over the hole
mole ducks just avoiding the light
slowly the boys heads appear from the hole
the whole camp is in front of them
there is a huge barbedwire fence on one side the side they just dug from a dozen armed guards with huge dobermans patrol the grounds with howitzers
it doesnt look good
one by one the mole stan kyle and cartman pop out of the ground and run for a nearby building
once at the building they all duck to avoid the search lights
the americans must be holding terrance and phillip in one of those bunkers
we will split up here
lets synchronize watches
the others look at each other
we dont have watches
you dont have watches
dude you didnt say anything about watches
what do you think this is kid
lick barney the dinosaurs pussy fucking kiddie hour
this is real life with consequences you take to the grave
dude we dont have watches

and ze rope
and the butfor

then mole takes a long drag off his cigarette and slowly blows the smoke
now listen carefully
stan and kyle you stand watch here and await my return
if any guards come by make a sound like a dying giraffe
whats a dying giraffe sound like
putting his hands to his mouth gwpaapa
the mole turns to cartman
cartman over zere is the electrical box
you must sneak over zere and shut it off before i return with terrance and phillip or the alarms will sound and i will be shot full of holes
you must shut off the power this is very important do you understa cartman storms off
i will tunnel my way into ze buildings and find ze prisoners
the mole starts to dig
be careful dude
was my mother careful when she stabbed me in the heart with a clothes hanger while i was still in ze womb
and with that the mole quickly starts to tunnel his way underground
damn dude that kid is fucked up
back on stage at the uso show
winona ryder is just finishing up her song
singing its a hell of a town
and thats my new york melodyyyyyy
the band finishes with a flourish
winona takes a bow
one person in the entire audience claps
lets hear it again for the one and only winona ryder
the same guy claps again
we love you winona
everybody else in the audience just stares at him
next up we have a special treat
please welcome direct from vegas big the place goes wild as big gay al walks out on stage
winona fumes in the wings
this guy is the coolest
the back curtain goes up to reveal a tropical jungle set complete with a waterfall hippos monkeys and hundreds of colorfully dressed dancers
how we all feeling tonight
between the cheering we hear a throng of happy
now the place is rocking
everybody loves big gay al
winona cant believe it
i cant hear you
friends you know why im here

the crowd cheers
im here to say that were all people under god and we should embrace and accept our differences
the crowd cheers louder
and that means we should love canadians the entire place goes incredibly quiet
you can hear a pin drop
slow music swells in
big gay al saunters around the stage and starts to sing
singing bombs are flying people are dying children are crying politicians are lying too cancer is killing texaco is spilling the whole worlds gone to hell but how are you
suddenly big gay al is wearing a big feathery outfit and all his dancers dash to his side
thanks for asking

the crowd is absolutely confused

cartman is by himself slowly moving from building to building
he is scared out of his mind
imitating the mole shut of ze power cartman
zis is very important cartman
stupid british piece of shi he approaches the electrical box
just as hes about to open it two armed american soldiers round the corner
cartman gets scared and hides in the shadows
the soldiers continue walking
dude if i was gay id be just like big gay al
and pass a terrified cartman
the boys are waiting bored for the mole to return
i dont think hes coming back dude
just then we hear the mole return from his hole
he is carrying the ticket guy from the movie theater
oh thank you
thank you for getting me out of there
they locked me up for selling movie tickets to minors

thats not terrance or phillip

the mole takes the ticket guy back through the hole

the boys sit back down and wait again
meanwhile big gay als song continues im super

the chorus guys all pick big gay al up and dance around with him on stage
thanks for asking
all things considered he is better than okay
and its peachee nothing bugs him everything is super when youre lets fight fight fight against canada today
the song ends and everyone erupts into applause
satan is looking into a large oracle like ball
saddam isnt around but a few demons and kenny are hanging out
the execution is going to happen any moment
we must prepare
the demons make excited noises
mph rmph rm
get everyone in hell ready
when the blood of terrance and phillip spills the day is ours
two of the demons head for satans room
dont wake him
ill tell him
satan walks to the bedroom
cartman approaches the electrical box nervously looking all around for soldiers
he opens the door to the electrical box and sees a large switch labeled on and off
he reaches to turn off the switch when he feels a tap on his shoulder
then turns and karate chops in one spastic flurry to see son of a gun
kennys ghost is again floating in front of cartman
kenny again struggles to speak
mph rmprmmh rm
i dont have proofs of purchases from snacky smores kenny
cartman runs off leaving the power completely on
ike is still just sitting quietly in the dark attic
suddenly the attic door bursts open
other soldiers file into the attic and grab ike by the arms
yep thats a canadian alright
the american soldier picks up ike
so thought you could hide from us did you
take him away
the soldiers drag ike down the stairs
sir look at this
holding up a book he was writing some kind of diary
what does it say
reading cookie monster
sweeping moving music sting
kyle is patiently awaiting moles return
come on mole were running out of time
kyle spins around when he hears someone coming
but its only cartman
hes panting heavily
i saw kenny again
did you shut the alarm off cartman
cartman stops breathing heavily and thinks
just then all the alarms in the place go off
from the distance the boys hear gunshots
suddenly the mole pops out of the hole
the boys see that the mole has been shot up badly
zey went off
that was my bad sorry
as shouts and running footsteps draw closer the mole lays down and begins to die in kyles arms
do not let ze resistance die
gentle music begins
now the light she fades and darkness closes in but i will find strength i will find pride within because although i die our freedom will be won though i
die ze resistance lives on
the music fades away as the mole coughs up some blood
its so very cold
we cant leave without you
its okay i am done for
no i mean we cant leave without you we dont know where the hell we are
the mole coughs up more blood
where is your god when you need him
where is your beautiful merciful faggot now
the mole dies
the boys look up to see three large marines pointing guns at them
stan makes a run for it
he dashes off at full speed
one of the soldiers fires at him
but stan disappears into the night
the night will swallow him up
you are under arrest
so this must be the resistance the pentagon has been tracking
oh son of a bitch
kyles mother and the other mothers of mac take the stage again
and now for our big finale the moment terrance and phillip are wheeled out onto the stage
this cannot be good
i know terrance
this is quite the shitstorm weve found ourselves in this time
from the other side kyles mom appears with a couple of official looking military people
the crowd cheers
it is my pleasure to present to you the the crowd cheers
strap them in
terrance and phillip are then greeted by the executioner donned in a black hood
the scary giant executioner grabs terrance and phillip and puts them into electric chairs
today is a great day for democracy
the crowd cheers
the executioner steps up to the throw switch
phillip this is worse than that trip to quebec city when i fell asleep in that disco
i know terrance
long shot of a desolate dark area
it has started to rain
stan trudges through the wilderness looking tired and scared
where the hell am i
is anybody here
a few wolf howls sound in the distance
stan walks on
stan stumbles a bit
cant go on
stan falls to the ground
his face plops in the rainy mud and his head smacks against a rock
stan is out cold
just then a strange sound emerges
it is like a pulsating wobble
stan slowly awakes picks up his head and shines his flashlight around
what is that
the sound gets louder
stan shines his flashlight on something that is huge and throbbing
kyles mother approaches terrance and phillip
gentlemen do you have any last words
how aboot get me the fuck out of this chair
hows that for last words
kyles mom nods to the executioner
general plymkin walks out next to kyles mother
we have just captured some canadian sympathizers
the crowd cheers
kyles mother smiles
we will execute them along with terrance and phillip for your viewing pleasure
the mothers are all very pleased
that is until they see kyle and cartman brought out to the stage at gunpoint
we also have a canadian spy who was hiding out in south park
now ike is brought out at gunpoint
kyles mother rushes over to general plymkin
these are our children
they are canadian sympathizers and they must be dealt with accordingly
but theyre children
cartman walks over to where terrance and phillip are strapped into their chairs
terrance and phillip
can i get your autographs
sure tubby just as soon as were killed
we cant kill these kids
listen mothers youre the ones that started all this
dont get all emotional but were doing all this to help our childrens futures
yes i think shooting our children would adversely affect their futures
the general is right
this is the only way youre ever going to learn
i have an opportunity here to teach you about consequences
sheila youre going to far
those are your children
to kyle i am sorry young man but i have had it up to here
strap them in
she walks away
stan is still lying in mud but now he lies before a huge pulsating organic looking thing that belongs in the x files
its the size of a small building
the massive thing starts to glow
stan looks weak and afraid
be not afraid
behold my glory
i am the clitoris
stans eyes grow wide
music starts to swell up
i did it
i found the stan your friends need you
they are in trouble and you must help them
wait youre supposed to tell me how to get wendy to like me
there are more important matters right now
dude shes eight years old just get her some ice cream or something
now go your friends are in danger
the uso show is a mile east of here just over that ridge
the clitoris has spoken
the clitoris fades and just as it does all the kids of la resistance come running into frame
wendy and gregory are with them as well
stan are you okay
i see you failed in your mission
terrance and phillip must be dead by now
wendy bends down to pick up stan
come on stan we have to hurry
the canadian forces are about to attack
wendy pulls stan up off the ground and slings his arm around her
a drummer plays as the execution begins
we begin with terrance and phillip
throw the switch
the executioner throws the switch and terrance and phillip start to fry
kyle cartman and ike in their chairs look horrified
near death terrance cranks out a weak fart
terrance and phillip both laugh weakly but merrily
take that bitch
as terrance and phillip fry they scream out suddenly fwwooommm
a bomb lands in the middle of the army
it explodes with incredible force sending dead bodies in all directions
canadian military planes zoom overhead
its a full scale attack
from a high angle we see the soldiers all scatter like bugs in every direction
everybody just starts screaming and shooting in every direction
total and complete mayhem
one explosion knocks out the electricity and terrance and phillip stop drying
the electricity runs along a wire across the stage and right up cartmans leg
cartman starts frying horribly
frying whats going on terrance
canada is saving us
finally cartman is blown clear of the electricity
kyle picks him up and starts to run along with ike
satan opens the door to find saddam sleeping happily in his cozy bed
he is only wearing little black g string panties
whispering have you finished
now we see that kenny is standing at the foot of the bed
he holds a gasoline can and has just finished pouring the last drops underneath the bed
then move out of the way
kenny walks over next to satan
satan pulls out a book of matches
i must be strong
i must be strong
satan tries to light the match
it wont light
finally the match lights
satan holds it up goodbye saddam
and throws it onto the bed
saddam burns to a crisp and satan and kenny run out
people run screaming in all directions as a full scale attack has broken out
gunfire explosions and dead bodies fly all around
ned whips around and mows down a line of canadians
but one canadian makes it through and sticks his bayonet through neds neck
blood gushes from neds neck as he collapses
the boys runs as fast as they can amidst the explosions
zap now when the v chip shocks cartman we can actually see the blue current swirl around his body
general plymkin has followed his men into the trench where explosions and gunfire fly all around
he pulls out a walkie talkie as his men die all around him
they all fall in
a phalanx of black men chef included in them walk out in front of a bunch of white guys
just then over a ridge in front of them a line of canadian tanks appears
the tanks are lined up deep
behind them is a line of missile launchers
general plymkins jaw drops
holy mother of johosephat
the black guys all look at each other nervously
the boys run through the chaos
body parts and scrapnel fly here and there
a bloody soldier suddenly stumbles and falls in front of the boys holding a massive head wound
garrison lies on the ground coughing up blood
get him out of here
garrison takes mr
hat off his hand and gives it to cartman
just then garrison goes limp
cartman looks at the mr
hat in his hand and scowls
the boys run from the battle
they pass the american troops where all the black guys are standing in a human shield around the white guys
just like i told you
the canadian tanks take aim
the canadian tanks fire
all the black guys suddenly jump out of the way leaving the whites completely exposed
what the the tank fire hits the army blowing all the white soldiers to smithereens including ned and jimbo
operation human shield my ass
from an extreme wide shot we see all the forces on both sides exchange firepower
the canadian national anthem can be heard in the distance
we see mr
mackey looking like a natural born killer
he shoots like a maniac into the canadians
he wounds one and then marches over to the wriggling body with a knife
die canadian mmkay
and he drives the knife into the canadians chest
but then suddenly another canadian soldier appears out of nowhere and blows a hole through mackeys chest
mkay mackey falls to the ground dead
just then big gay al runs through the frame we follow him as he skips his way around gunfire
goodness those bullets are going another bullet zings by his head
jumping jesus this is insane
a bullet hits big gay al square in the head
more bullets follow tearing him to shreds
this shot parodies one of the big shots from saving private ryan
just complete overkill
explosions helicopters gunfire and death
kyles mother and the other mothers as well stand on a ridge overlooking the horrific massacre
this is terrible
kyles mother holds out her m
she is now completely insane
this is what we wanted
we wanted our children to be brought up in a smut free environment
but we didnt want this
i just followed you cause i made a shitload of money selling kenny t shirts
oh lord what have we done
wake up people
we all have to do things that arent pretty sometimes
its the not pretty things that make life worth fighting the not pretty things for
why do you think children have to be born in hospitals
the other mothers look very confused
why does it matter
my plan is a perfect plan
the other mothers walk away
where are you going
we need to stop the not pretty things from letting our children be born in hospitals
were going to find our boys
for gods sake sheila you almost had them killed
kyles mother turns back to the battle
more killing and explosions
they should only be so lucky
kyle wasnt even born in a hospital
she charges the field
terrance and phillip are dodging gunfire and super loud explosions
did you hear that terrance
they laugh merrily
come on we can take shelter in one of those buildings
but just then kyles mother comes charging in with her gun
phillip spins around just in time to see kyles mother plunge her bayonet into terrances abdomen
blood from terrances abdomen slowly spills from his stomach
everything gets silent as we follow the blood down down down
until it hits the ground with a huge echoing bwooommmm
close up on kyles mothers eyes
close up on the spot of blood on the ground
suddenly the ground starts to open up
great flames and ash take over the sky
satan and his minions explode from below
everyone stops fighting for a moment to watch this amazing spectacle
demons and flames emerge from the ground
all the soldiers on both sides cant believe what theyre seeing
now out of the giant abyss comes kenny
he dusts himself off and looks around
as more bombs and gunshots go off
kyle cartman and ike huddle close to each other in a trench
all those times i said you were a big dumb jew
i didnt mean it
youre not a jew
yes i am
another explosion rocks the trench
dirt flies all over the boys heads
hat in his hand what the hell am i still holding this for
cartman tosses mr
hat out of the trench
we hear gunshots and then very faintly we hear garrisons voice
suddenly stan jumps down into the trench
dude i found the clitoris
i think i can get wendy to like me now
sarcastic oh thats swell stan
i guess alls well that ends well huh
we can go home now
theres just one little thing left to tie up
world war three
more explosions go off
dead bodies fly all around the boys
suddenly kenny appears before the boys
i told you
kennys come to take us to the netherworld
mph rmph rmph rmph
hes not haunting us hes trying to tell us something
mph rmph rm rmph rm
we can get you some proofs of purchases for snacky smores kenny
just mellow the heck out
people are dying left and right
the doctor from the hospital scene runs in with an m
a canadian steps in front of him the doctor shoots and blows the canadians head clean off
hey pal dont lose your head
suddenly the ticket guys chest rips open
he falls dead and standing behind him is a canadian with a double barreled shotgun
im glad you got that off your chest
tom the rhinoplasty surgeon leaps in and stabs the canadian through the head with his bayonet
i guess he got the point
a canadian rushes in and machine guns tom full of holes
plastics are a cheap and efficient insulator for electrical applications
just as the fighting escalates satan and his minions rush in
fight and kill one another
the soldiers all look scared and puzzled
youre all part of satans army now
what the hell is going on
satan gets in kyles mothers face
i am the dark master
oh no you dont
this is my fight
i dont need your help alan dershwitz
kyles mother backs down ashamed
oh good job mrs
broflofski thanks a lot
i was just trying to make the world a better place for children
and in doing so you brought enough anger and intolerance to the world to allow my coming
and i thought my mother was the master of guilt
what have i done
one by one the soldiers start to kneel
satan throws his arms up in the air and laughs a horrible deep laugh that fills the world
but just then the ground shakes again
satan looks over to the huge abyss he had crawled out of and notices another figure
he is burnt horribly but it is saddam
he holds a martini glass in his hand
hey im missing the party
it cant be
saddam burnt to a crisp walks over to satan and grabs his ass
did you miss me buttercup
yelling out all right gang
i am your new ruler now
everyone bow down to me
satan puts his head down
kyle walks up with cartman stan and kenny
oh its the bratty kid from hell
you made a deal with kenny that if he got ten proofs of purchases from snacky smores youd grant him any wish
kenny pulls out the proofs of purchases
triumphant music plays
i told you not to make that deal saddam
who gives a fuck
i was just fucking with him
the deals off go away guy
you made a deal
you cant just renege on a deal
youre better seen not hear okay
saddam smacks satan in the face
now satan looks mad but he sits down like a good little bitch
now lets start torturing people shall we
well start with
looks at cartman this little fat kid first
dont call me fat buttfucker zap
a huge charge shoots from cartman knocking one of hells demons on his ass
holy shit cartman
what was that
how the fuck should i know
another huge charge emits from the v chip inside cartman and sends the other swedish soldier reeling
look at that
its that v chip thing thats inside you eric
the polarity must have been reversed by the electric chair
a smile comes across cartmans face
a huge charge busts the chains that hold cartmans wrists
he jumps down
triumphant music plays as cartman uses his newly found power
but before satan can do anything cartman holds up his hands and lets loose
a charge hits satan square between the eyes and knocks him down
he gets to his knees and stands up again
hey you need to watch your mouth brat
try this on for size cartman holds up his hands
the charge hits saddam in the chest
he drops again
saddam looks around and is suddenly scared
he appeals to cartman
no need to stress
let me make you a deal
how about a lifetime supply of snacky smores and we just forget about this whole thing
dont listen to him cartman
giving in okay
cartman closes his eyes and hums like hes summoning up the worst words in the world
then it comes out
like a volcano
a huge purple jolt emerges from each of cartmans hands and joins into one powerful current that hits saddam
saddam is thrown back against the wall
to satan what are you waiting for bitch
satan looks at cartman then at saddam and thinks
come on you weak stupid cum bucket
satan stands there
youve destroyed my life and now you want me to help you
youre always making me feel like a piece of shit
come on guy you know i only rib you because i love you so much
if you love somebody then you treat them with respect
youve never respected me
can we talk about this later
everyone is watching
i dont care
i want to talk about it now
saddam grabs satan by the arm
ow youre hurting me
listen guy youre embarassing me in front of my friends
you know how i get mad when i get embarassed
satan starts getting really mad
steam starts coming from his nostrils
your little problems can wait til later see
steam starts coming out of satans nostrils
now do what i say and keep your fucking mouth shut
satan picks up saddam and throws him over a huge flaming cliff back into the depths of hell
heeeeyyyy guyyyyy relaaaaaxx
saddam hussein is dead
youre quite a purveyor of filth little boy
indeedy that was a delicious choice of words
well i learned it all from you guys
of course you did cock fuck
they all laugh merrily
satan stands over the cliff looking down at where saddam fell
he spent so much time convincing me i was weak and stupid that i believed it myself
the boys look at each other confused
saddam didnt respect me
all he wanted was sex
but it took me so long to figure that out
he starts to cry
chef hands him a hanky
here you go satan thank you
give me the proofs of purchases
kenny hands them to satan
okay kenny i will keep the bargain
any wish you want is yours
track in slowly on kenny
finally kenny speaks
mph rmph rmpg rmph mm
are you sure kenny
what did he say
he said that his wish is for everyone who died in the war to come back
kenny you realize this wish is the only chance for you not to be dead
mph rmph rm rmph rm rmphm rmphm
mm rmphm rmphm rhmphm
triumphant music plays as if kenny is giving a grand important speech
very well then
i will put an end to the war as your wish and make everything as it was before the war started
but you kenny must remain dead
satan turns to the open abyss
i must admit im kind of relieved
its too fucking cold up here
arent there cold parts of hell
yeah but its a real dry cold
here its the humidity that gets me
i guess im destined to live in hell
sadly satan walks back down the trench into hell
but something catches his eye
satan bends down and picks up mr
he looks at it and then places it gently on his hand
hi there little guy
would you like to go to hell with me
i bet we can be best friends
and walks down to hell with mr
the boys walks over to kenny
thank you kenny
yeah thanks for going back to hell for us
youre a real pal
a bright red light flashes and satan and his minions are dragged back down into hell
kenny is taken along with them
at the same time garrison jimbo mackey and all the others who died suddenly and magically appear
they look at themselves wondering what just happened
everyone just stands around in a daze
canadians and americans alike look at each other and wonder what to do
we were all killed and now were fine
whew im sure glad thats over
yeah but you know i learned something today
i learned that getting all worked up over fuck and shit and cockmaster is just stupid
you all focused so hard on erasing profanity that you forgot the most important thing
to love each other
youre all a bunch of stupid sons a bitches
the boys parents walk up
mom im a man
just a man
and im going to have fun with profanity just like you and dad did when you were little
yeah so what if you say uncle raper or dicksucker or or shiteater or monkey fucker they all laugh merrily at their naughtiness
wendy walks up to stan
im sorry stan i guess you really do get it after all
how would you like to go get some ice cream
how did you know i loved ice cream
my friend the clitoris told me
wow i have a clitoris too
where the hell do you keep it
wendy grabs stan and plants a big kiss on him
stan vomits into wendys mouth
what about gregory
gregory stands off to one side scowling
stan i never cared for gregory
fuck him in the ear
singing thank my lucky stars here before me now is everything id ever hoped for knew it in a word saw it in a glance the only thing i think
id die for i cant stop now
my hearts awake
i pray your arms my arms to take
so this is why im alive
now everyone joins hands and starts singing kennys mom and dad come up
this is all so wonderful
i just wish our little kenny could see all of this joy
oh he can dude
kyle points to the sky
everyone looks up just in time to see a brilliant shooting star across the daytime sky
we follow the shooting star and then slowly zoom in on it
as we get closer we realize it is actually kenny shooting towards the heavens
as triumphant music plays kennys little body floats up and up through the clouds
note this will also be done in d rays of light from above bathe his body and he flies up into the warmth of the baby blueness
angels encircle him and give him a pair of wings
they smile gently
he feels calm
he feels good
amidst a group of angels kenny flies upwards and finally
