written by noah baumbach a cashier hands a boy his change across a counter
the boy stuffs the coins in his pocket
he lifts the cardboard tray with two hot dogs a bag of chips and two cokes
this is claude
we follow him he carefully carries the meal down the aisle balances it in one hand as he opens the door
the train noise blares as he traverses the area between cars
he enters the new car repeating the balancing act
he waits while a man shoves his back pack onto the metal rack above the seats
claude hurries a bit more now his concentration alternating between the food and the path
he sits next to a brunette woman
he hands her a hot dog
hes met by a severe and pinched face
the eyes have black circles there is a scar above her lip
claude instantly blushes and mumbles sorry
he gets up and hurries a few seats further
he slides next to a pretty brunette woman late s with straight shoulder length hair
her name is margot
that was quick
i sat next to the wrong person
she stretches up and peers over the seats
he grabs her shirt
please dont look
shell see you
careful with my blouse
margot is sleeping her head against the window
claude listens to his ipod
he takes out the earphones gets up and walks to the front of the car
opens the door and goes between cars
the train roars and screeches
he stops looks around
he screams again
claude and his mother gaze out the dirt streaked window at a river
an old castle like structure emerges from the water
houses are run down
in the distance theres a power plant
electrical lines crisscross the sky
claude puts his finger against the glass and traces the wires
will the wedding be crowded
i dont know
i think she doesnt know anyone anymore
how long has she known malcolm
only a year
is that short
pointedly would you marry someone youd only known a year
im not going to ever get married
i cant say i have a lot of hope for the whole thing
why are we going then
were supporting her
i thought she wasnt speaking to you
i wasnt speaking to her but im over it
a ferry is docked
cars pull up onto the boat
margot runs clutching a suitcase holding down a floppy wine colored sun hat
claude hurries alongside her a bag slung over his shoulder
the rumbling and sputtering of the boat
people get out of their cars and stretch their legs
claude leans against the rail and lets the spray hit his face
margots cell vibrates
the caller id home
she stuffs the phone in her pocket
why arent you wearing your new shades
i dont think i need them right now
you begged for those glasses
i know but
i will wear them i just feel like people might think its weird that a kid is wearing dark shades
claude reluctantly takes out a pair of thin wrap around punk sunglasses and puts them on
he looks around self consciously
you look very cool
he takes them off
i dont need them right now
margot and claude wait
the ferry has emptied out
do they know were here
a maroon volvo station wagon peels around a bend and stops across the road
two eyes peer out from just below the backseat window
a man in dumpy cargo shorts rolls down the window
he has a small moustache hes harried and sweaty
this is malcolm
he points at margot and claude
he smokes with the window open
margot is in the passenger seat
in the back claude and the girl ingrid sit shyly their hair blows turbulently in the wind
ingrid wears shorts sandals and a batik shirt with a panda on it
paul apologizes for not coming shes still getting the house ready
im sorry it was such short notice
i dont care
pauls frantic but i dont give a shit
oh and ingrid wants me to tell you that she made us all bracelets
embarrassed no i wanted
i wanted to wait
oh i thought you asked me to tell them
malcolm holds up his wrist and shows a knit blue and orange bracelet
i got knicks colors
theyre not knicks colors
its beautiful ingrid
to claude i made this one for myself
she shows him the purple and green one around her wrist
yours is yellow
is that okay
wheres your dad and josh
they might come later
joshs spring break is next week
jim teaches through friday and then they open the house in vermont on the weekend
bluntly it means a lot to pauline that youre here
margot nods awkwardly she blushes
a car suddenly pulls out of a driveway but nowhere near their car
malcolm swerves anyway
watch it dicksack
margot clutches the handle above the door
if youre wondering about the moustache no i wasnt
i had a full beard for a while and then when i shaved it i left this part for last you know to see how it looked and
its meant to be funny
margot nods politely
the sound of tires on gravel the trunk slams shut
the volvo is parked in a driveway alongside a grey colonial house that sits above the water
they lift bags
an old mutt ambles toward them
pauline emerges from the house
shes pretty like her sister late s
she walks briskly toward them
margot smiles and opens her arms but pauline passes her and dips down to embrace claude
she kisses him on the lips
youre so handsome
now she hugs margot
they both tear up
i never thought id get you here
a loud thud
they all turn toward the property fence
a large pile of dead flowers and rotting plants has been dumped into their yard
theres whispering and movement through brush on the other side
margot looks at pauline with concern
youre arriving in the midst of a drama
ingrid make sure wizard is inside
malcolm trudges over to the trash cans
its the voglers
the neighbors want us to cut down our tree
she indicates a large oak that extends up and into the adjoining property
no thats our tree
they think its sick and rotting their property
were having the ceremony under it
you took the swing down
pauline thinks this is their way of trying to be friends
i think they resent us because were
he searches for the word but cant come up with anything
he says wearily i dont know what we are
claude sits on the squeaky bed a yellow bracelet on his wrist
an old flip clock hums on the night table
a door opens onto a bathroom which has another door open onto another bedroom
ingrid sits on her bed observing claude
she holds a realistic looking stuffed rooster in an old style tuxedo
this is my room
do you like showers or baths
what about you
she says already bored with the topic i dont care
pauline and margot carry bags up the stairs
margot now wears a knit red bracelet
theyre tentative with one another
is malcolm what you thought hed be
well i didnt know what to the moustache is temporary
he left it for last when he was shaving
its meant to be funny
he told me
they enter the guest room
the windows are wide open the curtains blowing but the room is very neatly made up
im sorry with so little time to prepare we had to put you in malcolms storage room this was beckys room
yeah poor becky
now its a storage room
ive just started to feel like its our house not my parents
it might still smell like paint but
i thought he was a musician
pauline jimmies down the stiff windows
margot begins to unpack and hang up clothes in the closet
well musics officially a hobby
hes painting now
and writing letters to newspapers and magazines
hes very meticulous hell spend up to a week writing a response to a music review
hes incredibly smart
maybe too smart
i dont know
were doing very well
i mean you must be
i dont know where to begin
what can i tell you
it seems im pregnant but its really early so
i havent told anyone
i mean i havent told malcolm or ingrid
yeah if it sticks
i hope so
things are good
we did a couples seminar two months ago or so in maine
they give you exercises and things to do
i know youre not convinced but
vaguely mm hm
we got engaged right afterwards
the guy who runs it strickland wrote a really interesting book about loving which ill lend you if you want
non committal okay
but only if youll read it
because i need it back
i made notes in the margins
i may not get to it for a while
well im not going to lend it to you if youre not going to read it
they meet eyes
pauline quickly turns away
its going to be very informal by the way
just mom and becky
and now you and claude
nothing like the first one
wary beckys coming
she isnt how you
id really like
i was going to say id really like some white wine
we have a
im glad you changed your mind and came
i never heard from you after i sent the invite
i even wondered if you got it
quickly well im so pleased were here
did you get it
pauline waits for an explanation
im sorry you were so angry
i wasnt angry
but you see when you say disappointed it puts me in a crummy situation
like i let you down
but you did in a way
i dont see it like that
i felt betrayed
is that word okay
again youre making me the aggressor
you were the aggressor
pause lets not
ive become a really good cook
malcolm strums his guitar and smokes
pauline sits at his feet with ingrid and claude
the kids look at a record sleeve
margot is curled up on the sofa writing in a little brown notebook
she wears oval tortoise shell glasses
i cant believe youve still got all of our old records
ingrid pulls an album toward her
her eyes widen at the scary image on the cover
she quickly turns it over and hands it to her mother
mom can you hide this please
pauline puts the record sleeve on top of a shelf
for margots benefit malcolm played with ric ocasek once
in the late s
it was a solo gig after he left the cars
so youre kind of famous
believe me im not
i used to want to be but no
do you want to be famous
claude wants to be very famous
well make sure you can handle rejection
for me expectation just turns to disappointment
so ultimately id rather not try
itll all go black for us soon enough anyway
claude ignore him
pauline sneaks a look at margot who is watching malcolm with an expression of either contempt or confusion
pauline grows uncomfortable
she says to claude when your mother moved to new york she used to send me books and records
she sent me rems murmur
and the pixies
she was very cool your mother
you only liked top forty
yeah but i love rem now
margot takes off her reading glasses and rubs her eyes
i dont really listen to music anymore
i was dating that guy horace back then
was that the guy who liked to rough you up
no that was our dad
pauline and margot crack up laughing
malcolm raises an eyebrow at claude
our father used to strip down to his skivvies and beat us with a belt
that man had a sexual screw loose
its awful that stuff that happens to kids
malcolm was fondled by a male baby sitter
just use that information however you want
were with family
claude looks at malcolm
malcolm doesnt meet his eyes
i think becky got it the worst
did she ever
raped by the horse trainer
margot breaks into laughter
pauline spits her seltzer back into the glass
they both laugh hysterically
tears stream down margots face
malcolm pauline margot claude and ingrid sit with a homosexual couple alan s and toby s and their son bruce at an old wooden table eating crab salad and soup
part of alans face is paralyzed
alan rolled over in bed and looked at me and he said i cant feel my face
it took three doctors before we knew it was bells palsy
they say a brush of wind can do it
feeling is slowly coming back
were all getting older
which is terrible i dont care how universal it is
i cant remember names anymore
i have that
i blank out on certain words now too
like the other day i couldnt remember the word for
laughs ive forgotten it again
the stuff in wine
that was it
i know that
i was talking more about not remembering who was the bassist for motley crue
malcolm lights up a cigarette
he offers one to claude who shakes his head no
ingrid why dont you show claude and bruce the game trunk
claude reluctantly follows ingrid and bruce
he looks back longingly at the table of adults
relieved to himself mick mars
toby i think you need to have bruce diagnosed
margot i dont want to have this conversation with you
we follow the kids inside
we hear in the background its vital
if you keep telling him hes like everyone else hell wonder why he isnt
hes tested very well
he does bs in school
claude stops his mother and toby are arguing out the window
her eyes meet his for a second they make no connection she goes back to toby
but thats how autism works
one part of the brain can work fine while the other is damaged
we had him diagnosed margot
nothing was found wrong
did you really though
im not going to have this conversation
i know it must be so difficult for you but i think you have to pauline unloads the plates onto the kitchen counter
she hesitates and exhales a deep anxious breath
margot paces while talking on a cell phone in the herb garden
she drinks a white wine with ice cubes and smokes a joint
the bottle lies at her feet three quarters empty
what are you doing
i left you a note
or meet me in vermont on saturday
the wedding is on saturday
im here for that
i cant really pull out
how would that look
you havent spoken to her in years well were speaking now
she is my closest friend despite it all
youre the one whos been trying to get me to call her
did you tell claude what youre doing
suddenly laughing jim this guy malcolm
hes exactly what youd imagine except i think hes clinically depressed
not ugly but completely unattractive
and he has no job
the best i can make out is that hes a letter writer
i dont know the house looks weird to me
shes trying too hard and its kind of a mess
they took down the swing
silence on the other end
you said you werent a hundred percent on this
you said that like a week ago
can i come up there
i dont want to see you i feel happier already having done it
you feel happier
silence please dont tell claude anything please until weve talked more
i need to tell him
and we need to tell josh
did he do his homework
this is happening and you have to get your mind around that
claude sleeps in bed
margot gently touches his face
she whispers are you asleep
will you remember this
i just talked to your dad
claudes eyes remained closed but he smiles
im only going to tell you if you wont remember
she changes her mind and says thoughtfully everyone finds you so funny and charming
i always get compliments about you
she catches herself in a warped mirror and smears some eye make up off of her face
are you having fun
is it nice to see pauline
opens his eyes yeah i really like her
she is crazy though
in what way
shes really berserk
maybe its hormones
you dont notice anything different about pauline
shes pregnant she told me
but shes keeping it a secret i mean from malcolm and even ingrid
which i think is unforgiveable
now shell have to marry him
whats she planning to get married and not drink champagne
then shell just be lying
i guess shes afraid shell miscarry
she probably will
i think on some level shes ambivalent about the marriage and thats why shes not telling him
are you stoned mom
maybe a little
i dont like it
water runs from the bathroom
malcolm cradles a glass of whiskey and stands nude in front of a full length mirror
shakes his head my scrotum is longer than my penis
he turns around and looks at his ass
pauline walks out of the bathroom
she wears mens pajamas the top open
its sweet how claude looks up to me
he waits for a reaction and gets none
margot doesnt seem as crazy as you made her out to be
what she did to toby and alan tonight didnt seem crazy enough for you
i guess that seemed pretty crazy
immediately defensive well she cares deeply
yeah shes really worried about bruce
this has nothing to do with bruce
she thinks everyone is autistic
malcolm is about to speak but instead he halts paralyzed
nothing you keep changing your position im just trying to figure out if i should agree with you or not
well cant she be both care deeply and be crazy
do people have to be all one thing
i guess not
back into it it is nice she came for the wedding
shes so pretty dont you think
warily shes attractive
a little thin maybe
but it is nice she came
margot lies on her front her hand underneath her
she tries to masturbate
the bed creaks
finally she flips over and gives up
she wears a rubber night guard in her mouth
a croquet game in progress
pauline and malcolm play margot and claude
ingrid lies in the grass singing to herself
the dog next to her
malcolm concentrates he carefully lines up his shot
finally he swings the ball misses the wicket
he shakes with frustration
claude looks through a slit in the wooden fence and into the neighbors yard a naked man s crouches
arms extend from below and pull him downward
his ass pokes up over the weeds
honey youre up
claude shakes out of his reverie
he walks briskly up to his ball and smacks it
it bullets forward and lands just short of paulines ball
claude dont just whack it
think about it before you hit
pauline knocks her ball into claudes
she holds her ball down with her foot and prepares to swing
paul what are you doing
im sending claudes ball into the bushes
take the extra hit
i dont want to do that
its the smarter play
she whacks claudes ball travels about two feet
see i knew you couldnt
your feet are too small
margot steps up to take her turn
she regards the house
you took the awnings down
claude looks back into the adjacent yard flashes of skin
claude crouches to see more clearly the bodies disappear from sight
malcolm draws a deep breath and takes a few practice strokes
he swings his ball rockets past margots rolls up over a ridge and onto the cement drive
it quickly sails down into the road and bounces into a ditch
malcolm shakes furiously
he lifts his mallet turns toward the house rethinks momentarily and hurls it up over the incline and down to the water
pauline puts her hands on her hips
malcolm hesitates then tramps down the stairs to the beach
claude watches the pink of flesh moving up and down
honey youre up
he approaches his ball and smacks it toward the double wickets
youre going the wrong way
he blushes and laughs
margot shakes her head
mom im sorry
margot places her mallet down and starts toward the house
were in the middle of it
this is why i hate games
i hate what it does to me
pauline cackles loudly
margot turns around and stares at her
malcolm calls from the stairs wait were not finished
the five eat a salad nicoise lunch
malcolm do you notice how pauline sometimes cant make eye contact
how her gaze hovers just above your head
yeah i kind of know what you mean
i always think i have something in my hair
its not necessarily bad paul
its just something you do
pauline looks mildly horrified
she suddenly turns to claude
claude have you ever seen your mother climb a tree
we dont have much opportunity in manhattan
as kids margot climbed everything
she could even climb that tree
she points at the tall oak that stretches over the fence into the neighbors property
can you do it mom
do it now margot
show him margot
margot strides toward the tree
the group follows behind
she grabs hold of a branch and lifts herself
claude grins impressed
with brisk dexterity margot scales the tree
claude pauline malcolm and ingrid watch with glee from below
i told you
margot reaches a perch near the top and looks down at the gang
she waves back
the sun is hot
she sweats flushed
she takes a deep breath and relaxes against the bark
trees for miles
the neighbors house is faded and grey
in the far distance toxic white smoke comes out into the sky
an earwig walks across her arm
she flicks it off slips for a moment and catches herself
her breathing grows more rapid
a bug buzzes around her head
she swats at it
her family has stopped watching
claude and malcolm throw a baseball
paulines gone back inside
ingrid clears the table
under her breath shit
she wipes her face her shirt is almost entirely soaked
the buzzing continues
close on margots ear
a small black gnat lands on the lip of the lobe
it hesitates and darts inside the hole
she jams her pinky in her ear
pauline comes back out with an ice tea
whats she doing now
dryly shes stuck
a young volunteer fireman climbs a long ladder up the side of the tree and toward margot
he reaches out his hand to her
annoyed i got it
she slowly lowers herself
pauline is laughing recounting the story
claude and ingrid laugh too
margot shakes her head embarrassed and furious
you were great on the way up
dont patronize me claude
margot turns her head to the side and pats on the top of it
were all laughing margot
youre laughing in a kind way
claude is taking too much pleasure out of it
i am not
you like to make fun of me
to see me get embarrassed
margot puts her pinky back in her ear
what are you doing
ive got a fucking bug in my ear okay
pauline and margot hike along a dirt trail
claude and ingrid idle behind carrying walking sticks
i thought claude could hand out programs
ingrids going to sing
do you want to read a poem or something
you know i cant speak in front of people
im doing this conversation at the bookstore in town on friday and i totally regret having said id do it
youre doing a conversation
yeah talking about my work in front of a crowd
i didnt invite you because
i thought itd be boring
i would come
i want to come
i get a kick out of it
its just weird you know
so youre not here for
she stops herself okay i get it
when did they ask you
a while ago
id said no but then when i was coming here anyway and
i guess it helps sales and
we catch a quick glimpse of people walking ahead in the path
did i tell you becky got her tubes tied
is she seeing someone
shes still obese i assume
i think its symbolic
i bet mom paid for it
we should audit mom
i considered it in my twenties
you know when i was fucking everyone
i did my share
but not like me
you want to count
no margot i dont want to count
pause what was it about dad that had us fucking so many guys
i think it was the only time we could really feel unselfconscious and get out of our heads
dismissive i dont think thats it
i just think it was something we were good at
behind ingrid smacks her walking stick into claudes
your mom thinks bruce is gay
no she said she had aspergers
i thought thats what that means
no its like lesser retarded
i have adult add
you mean child add
no for some reason i have the adult one
maybe im retarded
up ahead in the path is a couple s with a six year old girl
the back of the mans pants are smeared with dirt and the woman is packed into acid washed jeans
the little girl whines and lags behind
margot and pauline slow down
claude and ingrid catch up
i dont want to
i dont want the woman grabs the girl harshly by the arm and pulls her
the girl screams
the man and woman turn around sharply
be careful the way you pull on that childs arm
youll take it out of its socket
dont tell us how to treat our child
i dont care how you treat your child as long as you dont hurt him
under her breath its a girl
she threw a rock at me
shes a little girl
she knew what she was doing
she starts suddenly toward margot
there is no hitting in our family
do you understand
margot backs up quickly
the woman stops about ten feet away
stay out of it bitch
the woman turns back around
she lifts the girl into her arms and they trudge over the incline and out of sight
that was the voglers
jesus margot what are you doing
they already hate us
wiping her eyes dont tell me what i can and cant do
thats child abuse
mom she was psychotic
stop picking on me
the four of them emerge into a clearing
a childs pink sneaker lies in the path
pauline walks over to it
it could be anyones
margot bursts into tears
pauline hesitates then holds her
what are they going to do to us
theyre not going to do anything honey
malcolm looks at pauline
hes in the midst of writing a letter on a legal pad
pauline is worked up
we have to cut down that tree
where are we going to get married then
well do it in the fucking drive way if we have to
claude and ingrid listen from just inside the house
ingrid looks at claude nervously
your mom started a war
we have to make sure we wear shoes because they might start throwing glass
has that happened before
i cant remember
i think so
no it definitely has
now i remember
behind them margot made up and wearing a dress clomps down the stairs across the carpet and onto the porch
where are you going
tersely to town
ill be back for dinner
come on nobody blames you margot
an old orange bmw idles at the end of the driveway
pauline malcolm claude and ingrid watch margot cross the drive way
a man s opens the passenger door
he smokes a brown cigarette
margot gets in
the man waves at the group on the patio
pauline malcolm and ingrid and claude wave back
is that dick koosman
he has a house up here
whats he doing with mom
ingrid sits at the roots of the tree squeezing honey out of a honey bear onto her hand she watches the ants come
claude sits on a low branch and looks over the fence how much do your parents make in a year
i think about a hundred
they bank at chase
the front door of the voglers opens and a boy pees from the entrance way into the plants in the yard
are they rich
theyre middle class
the boy finishes and violently hurls a toy car at the fence
just let me live
the toy lands a few feet short
he goes inside and closes the door
upper or lower
i think just middle
claude watches malcolm scurries around the side of the vogler house holding a dead mole by its tail
he stumbles recovers and flings the animal at the front door
he races back toward his property
margot and malcolm have cocktails
pauline drinks a bottled water
ingrid has cray pas markers and paper and draws at a table
she draws a mole
claude draws a boy with a big claw for a hand and clawed under it
wizard the dog lies at his feet
dick and his daughter asked us over to swim tomorrow
we didnt invite them to the wedding
youre not really friends
were friends enough thats its awkward
maisy baby sits for us all the time
hes doing the interview with me in town on friday
did i tell you he and i are collaborating on a screenplay an adaptation of one of dicks novels
no i didnt even know you knew he was up here
malcolm takes one of ingrids markers and doodles
is he even a good writer
why do people care about him
youre competitive with everyone
it doesnt matter if they even do the same thing as you
to claude hes competitive with bono
i dont subscribe to the credo that theres enough room for everyone to be successful
i think there are only a few spots available and people like dick koosman and bono are taking them up
pauline looks at malcolms drawing
its a graphic image of a man fucking a woman in the ass
malcolm what would ever make you think thats something to draw right now
claude and ingrid stare at it
malcolm balls it up
sorry i wasnt thinking about it
the car pulls into a driveway
a modern house
dick and maisy come out to greet them
you found it
margot the kids and pauline get out
we stay in the car with malcolm
pauline comes to his window
i dont want to do this
come on dont be that way
maisy sits on the hood of the car and ingrid introduces her to claude
dick approaches margot she turns back to pauline
im not being that way i just dont feel like it
im going to go back and
i have work to do
dick doesnt care that you dont make any money
is that why you think
thats not why im
i just hate swimming
i really hate it
its disgusting to me
my mistake was saying id do it to begin with
you have fun
fine well have fun
malcolms gaze goes to maisys breasts
margot watches him watch her
people always pee in the pool
i dont think dick and maisy pee in their pool
ill bet you dollars theres pee in that pool
pauline and margot float beneath claude who stands above them
to the end and back
claude you say go
margot knocks on the side of her head with her hand
pauline flings herself in and is off
margot hesitates then follows
maisy and dick watch from the chairs
ingrid floats on a raft and cheers
claude runs along the pool side
hows your dad
he and i shared a thesis advisor at stanford
did you know that
pauline hits the far wall with her palm and flips around
margot stops short and follows her sister
theyre neck and neck
their arms cut in and out of the water
i was dating your mom back then did you know that
pauline lands touches the wall first
margot a close second
margot immediately drifts to the ladder
shes panting heavily
you didnt touch the wall
i did so
it doesnt matter
i lost anyway
it was close
pauline floats on her back exhausted
ingrid swims beneath claude long strands of hair stream up from beneath the surface
margot gets out of the water and dick wraps her in a towel
for a moment its an embrace
margot looks quickly over at claude his foot slips
he topples in
water roars around him
he opens his mouth
bubbles spurt out
he drifts down
lying next to the drain is a field mouse
its eyes are white
hands wrap around him
he goes up
the sounds of wind and blurry voices now clearer
pauline brings claude to the surface and pushes him to the ladder
she helps him climb out
ingrid and maisy are grinning
their expressions slowly shift as they see claudes face
claude is sobbing
margot immediately wrenches claude from paulines grasp
she looks shocked and angry
i got him
she leads her son behind the bushes out of everyones sight
its okay my baby
she gently lets him down
his sneakers squeak and slosh
claude soaking wet and ashamed looks at his mother
she breaks into laughter
claude wipes the water and tears from his eyes
im sorry i laughed about the tree
now were even
margot reclining on the couch drinks a white wine with ice cubes
pauline passes the doorway and stops
she holds tear sheets of flowers and wedding decorations from various magazines
here you are
youve got a problem
what do you mean
i dont like the girl and i dont like the way malcolm looks at her
oh come on its sexy
you didnt see it
i saw it
youve got a problem
im not worried
pause we could teach claude how to swim
he wont want to do it
its too late
pauline waits for more nothing comes
she takes a couple steps into the room
she holds out her hand for the glass
margot passes it to her
are you supposed to be doing that
she hands it back
i liked your last story in was it harpers
the one about mom
i was very
i liked it very much
it wasnt really about mom
i thought it was
why dont you want claude to know how to swim
i didnt say i didnt want him to
why do you care
its not in his life were new yorkers
if he wants to learn when hes older he can
im curious why youre so interested in the whole thing
as a safety thing and
its interesting this is the first time dick has invited us over
but are you really friends
we employ maisy
i mean i dont care i just think its interesting
pause are you excited about the talk
i thought id come if thats okay
my friend agnes asked me whats it like to have a celebrity as a sister
i said ive got no problem with celebrity
alice munro taught at bennington and was kind of a friend of mine
im not a celebrity
well youre well known
to a very few people
just accept the compliment
i guess i didnt realize it was a compliment
margot walks the path alone
she hugs herself as a light breeze kicks up
her footsteps echo in the trees
the little pink sneaker still lies in the dirt
she crouches down and takes it
close a note is being written
and if you are acting with any sort of abuse toward your child i will call the police
the word any is then underlined twice
the page is torn from her little brown book
margots fist is raised about to knock on the front door
she stops herself
she puts the note on the welcome mat and holds it in place with the childs shoe
she wanders around to the back of the house
she looks into a lighted window its a white tiled bathroom
a wet brown animal body covered in clear plastic is balanced on the sink
vogler tears into the plastic
the carcass is butterflied open exposing the innards and ribs
vogler runs the tub
she pours salt from a box in the water
the man slides his hand in her waist band
she rubs against him
margot chews her cuticle
the man saws the legs
his arm jerks back and forth straining to cut through the bone
sweat pours down his temples
margot raises her hand to her face and presses against the window
she peers through her fingers
the blade pierces the bone with a violent release and the hoof falls to the floor
margot moves to another window
the pigs face now looks at her
blood drips and leaks into the crevices of the tile
the woman brandishes a syringe filled with an orange liquid
suddenly a face appears in the glass
margot leaps back
its a thin boy
he says something
the family turns to the window
the father flicks off the bathroom light
from inside margot illuminates like an apparition
margot scampers into the trees
she pushes through branches her shirt tears
claude sits on the bed
the record sleeve from blondies parallel lines rests in his lap
he reads the lyrics to the song sunday girl
he depresses the red record button on an old portable tape recorder
he sings a cappella and full voice passionately as sweetly as he can
maisy appears in the doorway and watches
claude turns mid lyric
he jumps startled
fumbling claude shuts off the tape recorder
she drifts into the room and hovers closely above claude who remains on the bed
margot passes by in the hallway disheveled from her escape
she watches maisy takes the lyric sleeve from claudes hands
her t shirt hangs above her waist showing her smooth stomach
can i make a suggestion
you should get underarm deodorant
you kind of smell
better i tell you than someone else
margot puts on mascara and watches claude who stands behind her in the mirror
i think you smell nice
you smell real
it causes cancer
its got chemicals and things that are extremely harmful
im not going to die from underarm cancer
no youll get it somewhere else
like your stomach or your testicles
dont laugh thats a serious thing
who told you this anyway
i hope youre not interested in that girl
i find her insufferable
what does that mean
it means i cant suffer her
shes loud and stupid
she goes on about things of which she knows nothing about
she got into harvard early
stupid people get into harvard early all the time
where did you go again
pause i just dont think you should do anything with her
embarrassed were just friends
if you do use a condom
claude looks into the toilet
a square of toilet paper with a red lip outline floats on top of the water
where are you going
out with paul and malcolm and dick
are kids coming
claudes pov through the window dick and margot in the back seat of the volvo
malcolm and pauline the front
the ignition turns
claude leaves the window
we hear the car rumble away
claude and ingrid sit on the couch hamburgers in front of them
maisy is cross legged on wizards dog bed and chews a stalk of celery
who do we know whos gay
how do i know what gay people you know
alan and toby
hes gay and aspergers
i dont know if bruce is gay
he might be its very common
your mom is pregnant
no she isnt
ingrid looks stricken
how do you know that claude
she told my mom
but you can tell shes hormonally weird
holy shit ingrid youre going to have a baby sister or brother
quietly my mom thinks your mom is unreliable
but he does
claude bites into his burger
his eyes fix on the crease between maisys breasts
maisy says to claude do you think your mom is fuckable
i dont know
i think shes hot your mother
id do her if i was gay
i might anyway
i mean if she came on to me
im not going to do anyone
theres a scraping sound on the window
the kids turn quickly what was that
is it scary
the three kids lie in the grass and watch through the slats in the fence the vogler family eats at an outdoor table
a pig turns on a spit over a smoky barbecue
vogler says something and the kids and mr
maisy climbs over claude to see better
he feels her breasts press against his back
suddenly he swats crazily at his ear
ingrid is poking him with a blade of grass
malcolm drives quickly with pauline next to him
hes smoking with the window open dick and margot in the backseat
margot used to never speak
i remember when we went on a double date in high school that kid ron asked you if english was your first language
i used to think i might have some kind of brain defect
you thought you were aphasic
im still not sure
oh jesus margot
its very possible paul
your diagnoses sometimes irk the hell out of me
malcolm lights another cigarette the car jerks sideways
malcolm can you slow down
i can drive if you like
no you got dinner the drivings on me
well ill let you pay your half if youll slow down
well neither pauline or i ordered dessert
malcolm let it go
taunting margot would insist on driving if she knew how
to dick my license elapsed
but i know how
its probably for the best
i have this theory i think historically women have been held back in so many ways that when they get power like they do behind the wheel they cant help
but abuse it
its akin to hannah arendts eichmann theory about prison guards and prisoners switching rolls
thats a charming philosophy
tell that one a lot
this isnt a blanket thing
i mean women can be great drivers too
he takes a long satisfied drag on his cigarette
said the man with the moustache that he thinks hes wearing in quotes
its meant to be funny
to pauline re margot are you doing this for her benefit or mine
malcolm pumps the brake
what the fuck
momentarily sober no there they go
i thought i had no brakes for a minute
malcolm pitches his cigarette out the window it flies through margots window and lands on her lap
dick grabs the lit butt and chucks it in the road
turning around what
the car swerves again everyone jumps
its fine margot
to malcolm youre just so incompetent
exploding why dont you fucking drive yourselves home
malcolm screeches the vehicle over to the shoulder
they jolt to a stop
quietly furious oh god
pauline opens the door and staggers toward the brush
she leans against a tree and looks like she might vomit
malcolm watches in the rearview mirror
you should go after her
malcolm sighs heavily and gets out of the car
margot and dick watch out the back window
pauline sees malcolm coming and bolts into the woods
malcolm charges after her
come back with me tonight
ive got claude
come on ive been trying to get you up here all year
vaguely shes pregnant
dick leans over to margots neck
he licks her
claude lies in bed with ingrid
he chews off a piece of his pinky fingernail
he hesitates and places it on an end table
why are you putting that there
i just want to keep it
i left a piece of skin in a movie theater once so it could watch movies all its life
i dont know if its the same thing
are you obsessed with maisy
youre always staring at her tits
ingrid traces claudes upper lip with her finger
you have a moustache
my mom bleaches it
im going to kiss your cheek and then you kiss mine
i dont want to do that
because its pointless
claude hears footsteps creak downstairs
he goes to the door and peers out pauline and malcolm a little disheveled and dirty climb the stairs
malcolm goes into the hall bathroom
pauline into their room
running water groans through the old pipes
where are you going
i thought we were having a conversation
youre starting to annoy me
claude walks he passes an open door malcolm is shaving his moustache the electric razor whirring
her brown notebook rests on the bedside table
he hesitates then opens it its packed with writing a nearly indecipherable cursive in black ink
the name claude can be made out on the page
claude takes the book and climbs up into bed
he nestles against the pillow and squints to read the writing
what are you doing
margot stands in the doorway with a glass of water
i didnt think you came home
where would i be
cant josh and dad come to the wedding
weve been through this
go to bed
claude slides down to the floor
can i sleep in here
we can put a pillow between us
just for tonight
claude takes a long pillow and places it like a barrier in the bed
we stay on him as he waits
finally margot climbs into the covers in a nightgown
when you were a baby i wouldnt let anyone else hold you
i think that may have been a mistake
malcolm his moustache gone a cigarette dangling from his mouth hammers in a stake at the base of a collapsed white tent
a workman holds a pole steadily
pauline sets up chairs around a series of tables
ingrid idles a few feet away
theyre in the midst of talking why was it a secret
because i didnt want to get you excited before it was real
its not really a baby yet
in two more weeks we can celebrate together okay
why did you tell margot
because shes my sister and i trust her
how do you feel about it
i dont want a sister
pauline touches ingrids hair gently
im going to go get wizard
she runs toward the house
pauline marches toward malcolm
margot told claude something i expressly told her in confidence
and he told ingrid
im stunned that she put me in this position
its so fucking infuriating
well its that thing where dont say anything
you know what
just be there for me
why do i have to be so careful around her but everyone is allowed to make fun of me
i dont know if malcolm what did i just say
sighs you know i just want you to take my side i dont need you to make it better
malcolm puts his hand awkwardly on her shoulder
ingrids really upset about it
i cant believe she did this to me
pause i didnt tell you because
i didnt want you to feel like you had to marry me
i found out right before our seminar
does that sound good to you
im still digesting margot telling claude
what a fucking nut job
i think im really happy
ingrid is watching from across the field
come here honey
ingrid hurries through the sparkly dewy grass
pauline hugs her and they spin
margot watches from the upstairs window
the mother and daughter walk arm in arm down what will be the aisle
finally margot turns away shes in pauline and malcolms room
she opens drawers underwear socks bras
topless photos of pauline posing in the bedroom
a photograph of margot and pauline in their teens on halloween dressed as pat benatar and patty smyth respectively
another photo of margot pauline and an obese woman becky in their s
margots expression saddens
she opens another drawer
polaroids of pauline and malcolm in different sexual poses
she flips through these and drops them on the bureau
amidst the underwear and socks she finds pill containers
she squints to read the labels
she opens one and shakes out a few blue pills into her palm
she swallows one and puts the rest in her pocket
more drawers open self help books incense pamphlets on buddhism
a stack of pornographic dvds
margot starts and shoves the drawer shut
im just looking at paulines incense and self help books
i dont understand it
this junk makes her look stupid and shes not
i dont like to think of her this way
shes such a hypocrite
somehow im a kook for going to therapy but shes got enough drugs here to medicate a
settles on a word an elephant
and shes always with these losers
malcolms not a loser
think about it
what makes you think hes cool
softens im more talking about her investment in things like the forum and ashrams
whats the forum
like a cult
she was in a cult
she and lenny also followed some guru who was a follower of the mukdananda who made her drink his bath water
who knows what shes doing now
claude hacks his way through the tall weeds
we move past him obscured by grass pauline and ingrid yell
margot enters the frame
the kids walk ahead
she stands a few feet away from pauline
the kids can be heard shouting in the distance
how long has he been gone
i dont know
ingrid brought him in last night but we couldnt find him this morning
did you tell claude im pregnant
i dont know
i guess i said something
you dont have to tell him everything
he wants to know
if i dont tell him he figures it out
where is wizard
ingrid approaches with claude
i dont know honey
ingrid sinks into her mothers body
claude and margot walk ahead
you didnt let him go out into the road or something where something couldve happened to him
why would you think id do something like that
im just making sure
thats a terrible thing to say to me
i didnt mean on purpose i just meant maybe in case
you knew something
margot enters and opens the refrigerator
she gets out a white wine bottle
she turns around and jumps startled
malcolm sits at the table eating saltines out of the box a pad and paper in front of him
i shouldve looked
im just writing my vows
trying to do something appropriate but also funny not jokey more character based humor
margot pours herself a glass of wine
she looks to malcolm to see if he wants some
he shakes his head
she takes a long drink
you having an okay time
besides wizard getting
well find him
or else i dont know
right or else hes dead or something
pause it means a lot to paul that you came
malcolm mumbles a tune
oh god this is the same toaster we had here as kids
paul is so weird
i hear youve heard the news
hard to fully take in
its a little abstract still
i havent had that thing yet where you realize that youre not the most important person in the world
im anxious for that to happen
i guess i have to thank you i wouldnt know yet if you hadnt arrived
of course i cant help but worry ill pass some not so great genes onto the kid
i mean in my family theres a lot of hand washing you know
i dont have it but my brother does
pause you working on anything now
besides the thing with dick
how about you
oh im working on some acrylic paint nobody fills the ice cube trays
malcolm stops immediately embarrassed
margot is looking in the freezer
she takes out the trays and brings them to the sink
she runs the water
sorry what were you nothing
it doesnt matter
no what were you saying
she treads back to the refrigerator balancing the full trays
i was saying im doing these abstractions in acrylic paint
but its not
im not getting paid or anything
i dont know i hate that question what do you do
you asked me
i know but
malcolm exhales in frustration
pauline and malcolm open the gate to the voglers property
i think we shouldnt mention the tree we should let them know that there will be people and music on saturday and it will be louder than usual
and that they can come for a glass of champagne
but you tell them
i think they respond to you better
they approach the voglers sun worn and paint chipped house
well i am ultimately one of them
you shouldntve made me shave the stache
laughs yeah right
oh hey ingrid is asking me if i was ever gay
do you know what thats about
vogler wearing a fleece vest and carrying a hatchet over his shoulders tramples out of the brush
his face is jagged and worn
hi im pauline
this is malcolm
weve met before
were your neighbors
the man watches them strangely with icy blue eyes
you gonna cut that tree down
well we grew up with that tree and were getting married under it saturday and she waits for malcolm to jump in
vogler says softly but sternly the roots are growing into our property
its rotting its killing our plants
we had a tree doctor out and he said it was healthy
pauline smacks malcolms arm
would it hurt you to say anything
what do you want from me
youre making me do the whole fucking thing
you brought up the tree
he brought up she stops herself
she says to vogler im sorry
this was better thought through back at the house
paulines gaze goes above voglers head like margot described earlier
he runs his hand through his hair as if something might be caught in there
we were wondering if you and your wife im sorry i forgot her name would like to come over for
you should ask her
she makes the plans
im going to go in now
he tramps inside
the screen door bangs
i felt like you didnt give me a chance to say what i wanted to say
pauline hits him in the chest and starts to walk away
malcolm comes after her his rage growing
i want to punch that guy in the nose
youve never hit anyone
i have too
lots of you dont know them
theyre not around because ive punched them
a smile breaks across paulines face
dont laugh pauline
its not funny
ill fucking punch your sister
malcolm clenches his fists
he points at voglers place
the threat is not out there
its in our house
its sleeping in my studio
i mean i wouldnt actually hit her but i feel
i feel like doing it
shes such a fucking idiot
shes not an idiot
you might not like her
she is an idiot
youre an idiot
youre both fucking morons
im so fucking
im trying so hard
you dont give me any credit
what is wrong
i dont know i have the emotional version of whatever bad feng shui would be
i dont know
you tell me you understand this shit
did you drink your teas
yeah i drank my fucking teas
dont judge me now
really i think when you look back at this youre going to see im not acting like a crazy person
that this is the right reaction
in proportion with what is going on
this is right
malcolm looks around furiously
the only thing available to him is a leafy stalk
he pulls on it but it wont uproot
he tears the leaves off in a rage
you have the most oddly self conscious form of rage ive ever i hate you
exhausted he approaches her
he says still with anger lets make love
pauline walks back to the house buttoning her dress
she looks up suddenly and stops a man watches her from the lawn
he holds a bouquet of flowers
pauline runs to him
her hand cups the back of his neck
claude runs from the house
pauline malcolm margot jim claude and ingrid eat fish stew and peasant bread
jims flowers sit in a vase
he wears a tan knit bracelet that ingrid made
it was a difficult decision because claude has so many friends at school now but it is expensive and bronx science is a great public school
i didnt get into stuyvesant
hes not a good test taker
i went to stuy
caught off guard really
id rather stay at packer but its so expensive
malcolm lifts up a bottle of jameson from the floor near his chair and pours himself another stiff drink
josh is a great test taker but claude thinks more abstractly
hes more creative
i guess so
jim smiles warmly at his son
i saw the one armed man who really has two arms at the bodega
did you give him confusing change
i tripped him up with some nickels
and a canadian quarter
you know what i tried the other day
sitting down to pee
have you done this jim
i did it as a lark
as a joke really
i was going to call pauline in and say guess what im doing here
im sorry i didnt get to have that experience
i was thinking you know my dad used to say why stand when you can sit
and this is a really good example of that
i mean it took me so long to try because i was embarrassed
to the sisters you guys do it all the time
i never sit down in a public place
i squat and hover
ingrid goes wide eyed for a moment
anyway i recommend it
at least to try it
jim im sorry about the room
its usually malcolms storage room so its kind of make shift right now
margot stares at jim
margot open your gift
an unopened present in blue tissue paper sits beside margots plate
i get self conscious opening presents in front of people
this weekend is about pauline
open it margot
margot slowly unties the white ribbon and peels away the tape
pauline groans come on get to it
margot takes out a pair of furry slippers
those look warm
i remember last year in vermont you said your feet were freezing
her eyes find claude who watches his parents carefully
she leans across the table to jim and they kiss chastely and briskly on the lips
jim drives with margot in the passenger seat
i already have slippers
well thats okay
two sets are fine right
it makes me sad to get a present that i already have
it makes me feel like you dont know me
she jams her pinky into her ear trying to get at the bug
whats wrong with your ear
i asked you not to come
i was so clear and you did it anyway so blithely
we need time alone to sort this out
you cant just run away okay so were here
im giving you this time
trying a joke well now youre putting too much pressure on me
jim smiles crookedly at her
she half smiles back
he takes a moment preparing to speak
then what is that
his headlights catch a woman cowering at the roadside
jim slowly pulls over to the shoulder
let me just
jim gets out of the car
a sobbing woman crouches cradling a bloody dog
please help me
jim comes toward her
please help me
he got hit by a car
please help me
margot opens her door and steps out
jim kneels down by the whining pit bull
the woman screams help me
careful he might bite you
jim suddenly lifts up the twitching animal
jim drives his front covered in blood
margot is shot gun
the lady rides in back with the panting pit in her lap
margot puts her hands over her ears
jim speeds up
he didnt do anything
roger is an innocent
hes an innocent creature
whispering i cant stand her
jim comes outside tucking his wallet in his back pocket
margot sits on the car hood smoking a joint
you paid didnt you
she didnt have her purse with her
it wasnt so expensive
rogers going to live
i dont give a fuck about roger
that makes me feel like shit
you make me feel like shit
i wouldnt have stopped
of course you wouldve
no i wouldntve
i would have kept driving
i hate myself when im with you
frustrated margot im not
i cant talk to you when youre this fucked up
youre just like claude in that way
you make me feel guilty
sometimes i find you so despicable
margot stubs out the joint on the car roof
jim suddenly removes his sweater and puts it around her shoulders
he fishes into his pants pocket for his keys
tears start down margots cheeks
i dont know
pause before you gave me your sweater i think i didnt realize i was cold
margot leans in to him her forehead presses against his cheek
after a moment he puts his arms around her
quietly take me home and go away
margot smokes by the open door
she drinks a glass of white wine
pauline eats from a left over chinese container
if it were someone else id understand it id feel sympathy even
but since its me i just feel bad
and horribly critical
i havent been able to tell claude whats happening
and i have to
im going to
frustrated how can i be all these people
how can i be married to jim
and fuck dick
and want them both and then neither of them
were at the age where were becoming invisible to men and if a guy wants to fuck us its very tempting
what are you saying
im saying if you get your sense of self from being fuckable and that starts to wane its very hard
i almost had an affair too
but you know you dont have to do it
you can i dont know get a manicure or something
margot grows furious
she turns to hide her face
you know i tell people youre my closest friend
i really miss you
barely me too
but i cant help feeling that you really came to my wedding because i live a mile away from the guy youre fucking
come on pauline
you make it sound like im using you
there is a long silence between them
finally pauline indicates to margot that she has something in her nostril
you have a
margot clears her nose quickly with her finger
did i get it
yeah i think so
suddenly paul what are you doing getting married to this guy
hes not good enough for you
hes so coarse hes like guys we rejected when we were sixteen
dont make a mistake like this
pause im sorry maybe i have no right to say that but you know im truthful so
would you rather i lie
who should i be with then
a smashing sound
margot steps outside two hooded figures turn over a recycling can glass smashes on the ground
garbage is strewn across the driveway
you pick that up
i will call the police
this is our property
pick that up
pauline remains seated at the table stunned
margot comes back inside
malcolm crams the trash back in the cans
he sees something amidst the milk cartons and corn husks
he reaches down and lifts up a severed pigs hoof
claude and ingrid idle in the tall grass calling to wizard
dogs usually come back i think
what happened to your dad
he went to vermont
he didnt want to come to the wedding
i dont think he could
i think he couldnt
pause you want to see me dance
the gangly weeds blow around him
theres a rustling in the brush
a patch of fur catches ingrids eye
under her breath wizard
the animal is gone
a figure appears in the distance behind claude
the boy the voglers son approaches shirtless in swimming trunks
ingrids attention goes to him
youre not watching
the boy comes into focus
he holds a dead squirrel by its tail
ingrid backs up next to claude
the boy stops a few feet away and hurls the squirrel at them
the kids jump back as it lands at their feet
where are you going
stopping we have to get home
is that your girlfriend
no shes my cousin
you a fruity
to ingrid you a fruity
with certainty no
we will hurt you
claude takes ingrids arm and they start to walk away
hes a vogler
hes just a stupid boy
claude sneaks a look over his shoulder the boy follows
claudes gait quickens
hold it i have a rock in my sandal
come on ingrid
ingrid slows lifts her leg and removes a sandal
the boy is behind them
claude yanks ingrids arm and she topples over
claude leans down to help her
the boy leaps on claude
they both crash to the ground and roll through the grass
get him off me
ingrid hesitates then runs toward the house
claude wrestles with the boy
the boy growls
he grabs hold of claudes arms and sinks his teeth into claudes shoulder
claude kicks and yanks himself free
he runs wildly
close on claude
tears stream down
he coughs and spits
claude bursts through the front door
ingrid sees claude and runs to the kitchen
margot in a suit goes over notes
woa dont run so fast
theres a boy
he bit me
alarmed who bit you
let me see
he tilts his head she leans down and looks at his neck
there are red and purple bite marks
rising im calling the police
claude grabs her arm
itll get worse
why did you say anything to them
claude this isnt my fault
that boy bit me because you couldnt keep your fat mouth shut
claude youre being a jerk
you shit in your shoes and then you fuck them
margot smacks claude in the face
ingrid stares wide eyed
a placard reads a conversation with margot zeller and dick koosman
people mull about with drinks
pauline and claude admire the display of margots books
you really want to know
ill tell you
she wrote a story about lenny and me
flips through pages yeah its in here
i mean we were talking almost every day at this point and there was no warning
maybe a couple of remarks that shed used some things of ours
then the new yorker comes we have a subscription and theres the story and
its things we said and did stuff i told her in confidence
i think it helped end our marriage
i read it and thought she hates me
she doesnt hate you
pauline stares at a blown up author photo of her sister
margot tried to murder me when we were girls
she put me on a baking sheet sprinkled me with paprika and put me in the oven
the crowd files in
margot and dick stand in a corner
jim was here
dick flips through some notes
is jim still writing
nods i told him to go to vermont without me
id love to see him tell a linear story for a change
jim never wanted to make it easy for the reader did he
the nicest man ive ever met but he cant play the game
im not joining him
im going to stay here and then
i didnt ask you to do that
pause the guys pointing at us
margot and dick sit on stools holding microphones in front of rows of fold out chairs
only a few empty seats remain
pauline and claude sit in the back
im very interested in your story middle children
some people applaud but it trickles off before it gets started
the father is a loathsome character yet we also feel a strange sympathy for him
yeah well i was very interested in exploring a father daughter relationship
while he clings desperately to her suffocates her really he also silently resents the responsibility of parenthood
theres this sexualized push pull with daphne which i find he craves isolation really
i always thought of him as someone who so over identifies with everyone around him that he begins to lose all sense of himself
you make his only recourse to abandon his family including his beloved daughter
right thats true
i write historical fiction so i dont have to answer to this but i wonder for someone who writes so nakedly about family how autobiographical is this portrait
margot rests her lips on the tip of the microphone
my father was a loving person
he had his days of course but
he was devoted to us as children
i wouldnt have written this portrait were it true
pauline nods slightly
but im interested in how the father could be in fact a portrait of you
margot stares dumbstruck
why do you assume its based on
we all take from life
i had to have our refrigerator repaired the other day at our apartment in manhattan
i was alone with a guy i think he was puerto rican sent over by
whirlpool i think it is who made our fridge
although he said he worked for an independent organization who whirlpool subcontracts
i think he was retarded
there was an anger in him and suddenly i became afraid for my life
i called jim at nyu
i asked him to come home
her face is awash in sweat
pauline takes claudes hand and presses it to her chest
his eyes widen fixed on his mother
it might be frigidaire
im not sure what im
i think i need to take a moment
she stands and walks off the stage
she realizes she still has the mike
she goes back and places it on her seat
almost incoherently youre an asshole
margot grabs a pill from her pocket puts it on her tongue and drinks from the faucet
there is a knocking
margot opens the door
claude looks up at her
pauline and dick wait in the background
i need to be alone right now okay
i dont know
ill tell you sometime
are you sure
go with mom
ill see you later
you said mom
snapping but you know what i mean
go with pauline
jesus do i
do i need to spell it out for you
she points go
a simple spare space empty except for pauline and claude
are you okay
youre your moms favorite
do you know that
i dont think she has a favorite
shes always liked you best
more than jim even
but theyre married
but she still loves you best
its hard i think to find people in the world you love more than your family
i like malcolm
i dont know
i do too
pause i can teach you to swim if you like
claude looks at the floor
his sneaker rests next to her open toed sandals
she taps his foot with hers
has your mother talked to you yet
i dont think so
are you okay
its hard to see your mom like that get attacked like that
it was mean what he did
i think it was really shitty
you know i think your moms going through a rough time right now and
whatever she tells you
like if she says shes leaving your father
remember that she often changes her mind and
i dont want you to worry about anything right now
claude says nothing
paulines volvo rolls into the drive
she and claude get out of the front seats
margot climbs out of the back holding a big cake box
no one speaks
malcolm in a fleece vest and safety goggles drags a chainsaw toward the oak tree
ingrid runs to her mom
hes cutting it down
pauline passes maisy reading on the patio
my dads late to pick me up
i hope im not a pain
youre not a pain
margot sits on the back stairs drinking a glass of wine with ice
the tent is up
the tables and chairs are placed around the lawn
she watches malcolm prepare to take the tree down
she puts her pinky in her ear and twists
i told paul i didnt want you guys to come
i thought it was interesting
what did paul say
i think she liked it
did you talk about me afterwards
i can tell youre lying
we didnt mom
i dont trust her
she really loves you
margot tosses the remainder of her drink into the weeds
pauline told me shes very disappointed in you
she thinks you laze about the house
ingrid is always offering to help clean or cook
she made bracelets for all the guests
even malcolm puts up the tent
you just wait until everyone else does it for you
thats not true
it is true
youre never helpful
i wish i had taught you better manners
i can try to make popovers
if i can remember how
she looks at him with grave disappointment
why are you looking at me like that
i just see how much youve changed
your body language
you used to be rounder and more graceful
youre so stiff now
what do you mean
retreating i cant explain it
margot shakes her head
shes suddenly distraught
its okay though
claude looks devastated
he starts toward the beach
margots eyes well up she says trying to make things better youre still handsome
pauline marches toward malcolm
malcolm wears the safety goggles and revs the chainsaw
are you able to do this yourself
pauline do you want me to cut it down or not
watch the tent
the jagged blades pierce the trunk
pauline crunches her face
malcolm stops suddenly
he walks around the tree and inspects the bark
indicating his fleece i liked how it looked on vogler
pauline starts to say something stops
i think its over between dick and margot
he was so cruel to her today
and poor claude had to watch it all
she should just get out of the marriage and then she can fuck whoever she wants you know
and dick koosman
what a choice
i hate the idea of dick fucking margot
what does that mean
you want to fuck margot
pauline thats not what i said
i know you have a crush on her you already told me that
malcolm reddens and starts the chainsaw again
they yell over the noise i didnt say that
i said i thought she was attractive after you grilled me
she has no interest in me anyway
not that it would matter if she did
have you ever done anything like that
what do you mean
have you ever cheated on me
malcolm shuts the motor
can i do this
those emails you had with that student of mine
exhales uh huh
i know you said it was nothing
can you say it again
i just did
now can i cut down the tree
you never did anything with her
she emailed me after we met at that reading at the college and
you know we were friends
right just a regular friendship between you and a twenty year old girl
pauline how many times do i have to say it
why dont i believe it
because margot cant understand why youre with me and now when shes around you look for things
hesitates you promise
pauline looks at him long and hard
malcolm takes off his goggles
malcolm and pauline continue to stare at one another
he guns the chainsaw
tears spill suddenly from his eyes
he flicks the switch off
im going to tell you something
suddenly terrified what
i dont want to lose you though
paulines face goes pale
im going to tell you
just let me
i dont want to know
we didnt really do anything
we were goofing around i was making fun of her cause she dates a jock
i dont want to know
i shouldntve put myself in that position i know that
we brushed lips really
it was barely a kiss
and then we stopped
that was it
his nose runs
he wipes it messily with his arm
our tongues touched
i dont want to under sell it either
we made out
i made out with her
i dont know why
i dont even like her
its been a heady time
pauline says nothing what are you thinking
please tell me what youre thinking
pauline rushes at the tree she smacks her hands on the trunk and throws all her weight behind one great shove
it doesnt budge
in frustration and rage she runs
ingrid is the only one on the patio as pauline approaches
has anyone seen wizard
upstairs i think with claude
pauline enters in a daze
a toilet flushes
maisy comes out of paulines bathroom
sorry i had to go
i hope thats okay i used yours
pauline nods strangely
she goes to the window
her dove grey wedding dress hangs on the back of the door
i love your wedding dress
its so unconventional and great
her eye catches the polaroids of her and malcolm nude which lie on top of the bureau
maisy looks at the pictures too
maisy shifts uneasily and leaves the room
maisy walks down the hallway aware that pauline is right behind her
is everything okay
maisy stops at the landing
claude sits at the bottom of the staircase playing with a string
claude do you want to play croquet
pauline raises her leg her foot hovers at maisys lower back
claude reacts with horror
maisy turns around to see pauline with her foot in the air like shes doing karate
paulines eyes dart around aimlessly
maisy stares confused
pauline slowly lowers her leg
something dawns on maisy
she races down the stairs
the deafening shriek of the blade as it cuts into the tree
malcolm is soaked in sweat
ingrid watches from a few feet away
in the distance dicks orange bmw grinds into the driveway
maisy hurries toward him
ingrid says buried in the noise theres dick
malcolm sees dick
he pushes the blade harder into the wood
is it almost ready
maisy is talking to her father
dick spots malcolm
he immediately starts toward him
cold fear creeps up his neck
dick speeds up
malcolm backs up slowly drops the chainsaw and bolts toward the water
ingrid watches confused
dick takes off after him
malcolm stumbles down the long wooden stairs to the beach
malcolm runs wobbily he pants already out of breath
sweat pours down his face and body
dicks gait is swift his arms stiff bent at the elbow
his jeans make a swish swish
he takes the stairs two at a time
malcolm grasps the railing moving as fast as he can sideways trying not to fall
he reaches the beach his feet sinking in the sand
he trips and topples forward
he looks up dick lunges
dick pounds malcolms head and face
malcolm throws his arms up and tries to block the punches
i didnt do anything
i didnt do anything
dick gets up
he kicks malcolm hard
i dont ever want to see you again
malcolm balls himself up against a rock
he cries fuck off dickhead
dick marches forward and kicks malcolm again hard
dick lights a brown cigarette and walks away
malcolm screams fucking dickbag
he touches his face and sees the blood on his fingers
choking on tears oh man
theres a rustling noise in the wind
malcolm looks a mud and sea coated wizard watches him with a panting smile
wheels sputter in the gravel
dicks car peels out with maisy in the passenger seat
claude and margot watch from the porch
pauline is seated at the table with place cards flowers silverware napkins dishes
come with me to new york
i cant talk about it okay but you cant marry him
you have to go now
we can think about what to do with the baby stands margot i cant dont turn vague listen to me i want you to pack all your things and get
out of here
you can take our car and leave it at the ferry
ill help out more
i can make popovers
pauline looks at claude strangely
she leans down and kisses him on the lips
do you love me
claude nods good
dont take this out on me
im on your side
no youre not
ive kept my mouth shut because no you havent kept your mouth shut
no you havent
kept your mouth shut
okay i told you and i was right
hes done an insane thing
you dont know this man
what he did is criminal
margot i cant
pauline shoves a stack of plates and silverware off of the table
the plates shatter
silence save for their breathing
becky and i talk about you about what a monster you are
is it cause mom gave me the house
cant i have anything
what was i thinking
i let you in
what are you saying
i dont recognize you its like youre channelling someone
the purple of ingrids batik shirt shines in the grass beneath the tree
the trunk a gash at its base teeters
pauline takes off into the field
ingrid sings to herself and traces the branches in the air with her finger
pauline sprints ingrid
ingrid says to no one in particular what
paulines breaths are rapid jagged
a wind whips up
the tree sways
pauline thrusts her arms out seizes ingrid and hurls herself away from the tree
ingrid sobs as they run
pauline looks back
the tree is still standing
they embrace a few feet out of its range
it wasnt going to fall
malcolm trudges up the stairs
hes bloody and tattered
wizard trots behind him
she hugs the dog and holds him by the collar
the three of them stand a few feet apart
theres a horrible creak and suddenly
crack malcolm pulls both girls toward him the tree topples the thick trunk rips through the wedding tent and crashes through tables and chairs and the fence onto the voglers
the speedometer needle wavers around
margot clutches the steering wheel
claude looks morose
pauline and ingrid sit stonily in the back seat
the volvo jerks into the oncoming lane and back
margot draws a deep breath
i thought you couldnt drive
irritated i can drive
why does everyone say that
i used to drive
they inch up a small hill
a car cascades down past them
the volvo shakes
pauline suddenly snaps out of her daze we have to call people and cancel
can i still sing
margot rolls down the window
to claude you do smell
well im not wearing any deodorant
they reach the top of the hill over the crest and descend
the vehicle picks up speed
margot presses down on the brake
i dont think
she pumps again no
we dont have brakes
resigned the brakes are bad thats right
what does that mean
what do you think it means
i mean what can we do
the car coasts faster down the hill
margot places her arm stiffly across claudes front
pauline wraps her body around her daughter
margot swerves into the shoulder she makes a sharp turn into the forest and crashes through the bramble and muck
the car slows until it comes to a sudden stop at the base of a tree
margot and claude pauline and ingrid trudge through the bony white trees of the forest their bags weigh them down
theyre all covered in sweat and theres dirt caked on their feet and ankles
i ruined these shoes
paulines face screws up
shes suddenly in pain
she races behind a tree
mom are you okay
mom what happened
margot steps to see around the trunk
the kids follow behind
pauline removes her panties from under her skirt
she tosses them in the brush
margot turns to the kids
ingrid hides a smile
did she poop in her pants
it happens to everyone
not just babies
itll happen to you too someday
margot and claude sit streaked with mud and perspiration
margot drinks a beer claude a coke
margot pops a blue pill in her mouth and swallows
ingrid swings on the rail
pauline hangs up a cell phone and hands it back to her sister
she takes the beer and swigs
i left mom and becky a message
i dont think mom knows how to work the machine
margot puts her pinky in her ear
i can hear it flapping
you should take care of that
it can hatch eggs
claude turns his head
in the chevy next to them sits mrs
vogler and the vogler boy
she sings along to the radio
she runs her hand through her sons hair gently
he nestles into her shoulder
the four of them get out of a taxi
a small peeling hotel
a dark tight space with a faded and dirty green wall to wall carpet
pauline combs ingrids hair on one of the two double beds
ingrid practices her wedding song
claude sits on the other bed and looks into the open bathroom door margot stands with her back to him
she talks on her cell phone in a whisper
she hangs up
claude walks inside
the sink drips
sweety theres a bus that leaves to vermont from town tomorrow morning
i just talked to your dad and hes going to pick you up
arent you coming
i have to help out paul and ingrid
claude tugs gently on his yellow bracelet
i dont want to go tomorrow
the distant bong of a low drum and beneath that chanting
claude follows margot to the window
ingrid and pauline are already looking out
clumps of demonstrators march in the street
some people hold up signs with slogans no more bring back the rest is obscured from the window
some marchers are dressed in black hoods with white face paint and carry cardboard coffins
pauline points to a guy in a vest
as he turns around we see it isnt him
pauline withdraws suddenly on the verge of tears
i cant live in that house alone
youre going to be fine
maybe i could get a place in brooklyn williamsburg or something
people are living there right
you dont want to live there
its all young people
but what do you think of that idea
you know if you dont want to come with me im sure mom will let you stay with her through tears youre already trying to pass me off on mom
dont say that
come on youll come home with us
you dont even know where youre going to live
you might have to move in with mom too
mouthing a whisper didnt you tell him
margot looks at her son who continues to watch out the window
pauline emerges from behind the armoire doors wearing a long nightshirt that reads i spent the night with arsenio hall
she enters the bathroom
she mutters to herself
what have i done
what have i done
margot jimmies up the stiff window to let in some air
a few stragglers still march in the street
trash and pieces of signage line the gutter
margot turns into the room
she puts her hand to her cheek and strokes her smooth skin
she watches her son who removes his jeans for bed
just then i felt so much love for you
pauline tucks in ingrid who lies next to claude
margot sits on the other bed scribbling in her brown notebook
pauline marches around and across to the other side of the room
she snatches the book out of margots hands
you cannot write about this
you cant have it
i wasnt writing about you
you already took a part of my life you cant have any more
and that goes for ingrid and malcolm and wizard
we all own our own rights
theyre not for sale
give it back
pauline glances at the book
if i could read your handwriting im sure id be furious
but if i ever see a story that involves a hotel room or any of this shit i will fucking take your bowels out
pauline thrusts the book back at margot the kids sleep in one bed
margot and pauline lie awake in the other
youve now successfully ruined two of my marriages
youre not wearing any underwear
its hot im pregnant
youre not hot your feet are cold
stop touching me
i am so hot
feel my head
margot puts her lips to paulines forehead
you have a fever
i dont have a fever
are you always like this
get used to it
mom and becky share a bed you and i will probably get the other
you should just go to vermont
i was thinking you know if you want you and ingrid could go to vermont
keep claude company and jim adores you
you dont like malcolm because youre not attracted to him
will you do it
i wont do that for you
pause did you two talk about me in town
what did you say
pause i told him you often change your mind
cheap plastic tables
a small karaoke stage in front
margot claude pauline and ingrid sit at the bar
margot drinks her wine with ice
she wears jims sweater
the kids have cokes
the remains of ketchup soaked french fries in a plastic red basket lie between them
a man with a mullet climbs up on the karaoke stage
the music begins
the man sways and sings on and on by stephen bishop
he croons sweetly and beautifully
claudes eyes moisten
margot swallows a blue pill and chases it with the wine
she takes her sons hand and whispers im sorry sweety
theres something wrong with me
im going to call him
margot quickly turns to her sister
im telling you
i need some clothes and things
he should get the hell out of our house
ill tell him to get the hell out of our house
pauline walks over to a pay phone
pauline holds the receiver to her ear
she stares at a drawing of a monster fucking a woman on the wall above the pay phone
malcolm is crying
the tent looks so lonely
it has no one to get married in it
malcolm sits in the grass the tree and wreckage behind him
and its smashed
im such a fucking idiot
please dont take me seriously
i mean take me seriously but not the fucked up parts you know
i love you so much
please marry me
you cant do what you did again
do you understand
no matter how tempting
at the bar margot watches her sister carefully
she absent mindedly picks through her red knit bracelet and drops it onto the floor
ingrid slides something small and grey across the bar to claude
you left it in my room
its a piece of fingernail
he hesitates then puts it in his pocket
at the phone pauline rests her head against the wall
malcolm is bawling on the other end
i dont know
i dont know
malcolm clutches wizard and sputters i ate some of the cake
i dont know why but i did it
how was it
its not too sweet
they sometimes make their stuff too sweet
maybe it was
i didnt even notice
they fucked up the cake
i love our little baby
i miss you
i miss you too
maybe we should do another seminar
malcolm says something incomprehensible
i cant understand you honey
margot finishes her glass of wine her eyes still on her sister
theres gramma and aunt becky
margot startles and looks out the window
across the street is an older woman s and a large woman mid s eating ice cream cones and looking in a boarded up shop window
they didnt get my message
pauline now stands above them
i told you she cant work the machine ingrids chair scrapes as she stands
she takes her mothers hand
margot remains seated
youre not coming
im coming im coming
what did he say
pauline and ingrid head for the door
claude waits for margot
what did he say
she grabs her bags and drops some bills on the table
to herself dont worry i got it
the sisters and children come outside
the mother and becky now idle further down the street
margot takes claudes arm and walks quickly in the opposite direction
claude confused glances over his shoulder
why are we we have to get you to your bus
a huge parking lot
a bus in the distance
claude tries to keep pace with his mother
did you do something
what do you mean do something
i mean why is the wedding not happening
is there something that you did
pauline has transferred all her stuff onto me
i dont understand her anymore
whyd she pick this man
it is really berserk
and you know she referred to me as her closest friend
we never see one anoth an unfamiliar sound comes out of margot
the sadness is unexpected she sobs uncontrollably
she tries to speak i mean were not close
even if we want to be
but was there anything real
how many times do i have to say it
you think so little of me
through her sobs its good youre going
you shouldnt be around me either
id go if i were you
will you find pauline and nana after i leave
half serious i dont know
maybe ill go to church
margot is sweating
she wipes her brow with her sleeve
she periodically looks behind her
nobody seems to be following
growing nervous are you angry at me
im not mad at you
i dont want to go with you mad at anyone
im not mad at anyone
up ahead is a tiny depot
people climb onto a white bus
can you come with me
no you know that
pause we should talk about the next few months a little bit and whats going to happen i dont like vermont
your dad will be very happy to see you
and im sure josh is dying to hang out
please come mom
suddenly irritable claude stop it
she watches a man sustain a long embrace with another man
margot closes her eyes
she breathes deeply
you used to need me to watch you when you played
what do you mean
vaguely when you first started to play with friends you wouldnt do it unless i watched you
you were afraid i would go out the back door
i dont know where i would go
our yard didnt lead anywhere anyway
she takes off her sweater and reveals an old faded yellow t shirt
she isnt wearing a bra
claude says suddenly i masturbated last night
while everyone was asleep i went into the bathroom and did it
you dont have to tell me sweety
the bus driver slams the luggage compartment closed
youve got to go
margot ties her sweater around her waist and takes claudes hand
they approach the bus
claudes body tenses
how will you get home
i dont know
maybe dick can drive me to the
pause jesus i lost the word for a second
he looks at her longingly
you always dont want to leave me and you always have a good time once you do
provocatively i think you like getting away from me
i do not
i like hanging out with you
she hugs him
he clutches her
the world feels strange to me right now
margot nods sympathetically
she kisses his lips and releases him
he reaches into his bag and shyly puts on his wrap around punk sunglasses
margot makes a face
they make your face look too wide
claude removes them and puts them back in the bag
see you soon
say youll see me soon
youre acting like a baby
she backs away dont see dick
i dont think he wants to see me anyway
hesitates dont call me that
claude doesnt move
margot points at the bus and mouths go
she turns in the other direction
claude frustrated and anxious approaches the vehicle
claude hurries toward the back and finds a window seat
he puts his bag next to him and looks out the dirty glass
claudes pov margot her back to him puts her finger in her ear and shakes her head
the sweater around her waist loosens and drifts to the pavement
she starts walking
the bus hisses and lurches forward
claude strains to see margot looks back
the bus groans as it picks up speed
shes runs full speed waving her arms wildly
she pants breathless
the bus brakes
she passes claudes window
we stay on claude
finally she appears next to him covered in sweat and panting
she kisses him on the head
the bus starts moving
almost euphoric did you see me running out there
margot cranes her neck to see outside
that was a lot of running
im out of breath
claude turns away from his mother and looks out the window
