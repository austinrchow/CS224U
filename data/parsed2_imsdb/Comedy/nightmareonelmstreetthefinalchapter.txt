b if window
href b b nightmare on elm street freddys dead the final nightmare jacob johnson is sleeping
it doesnt look like a pleasant experience
he is sixteen dirty blonde his eyes visibly moving under closed lids as he sits huddle under a blanket in his window seat
the lights are dim the shade on the window closed a bead of sweat dribbles down his forehead
the humming of the jets engines vibrates through the cabin
the boys eyes snap open
jacob glances around nervously
he looks like an escaped convict who just accidentally walked into the policemens ball
a greyhaired man two seats away from him gives the teenager a cursory glance then goes back to his book
jacob lays his head back and tries to relax
the engines continue to drone
until a new noise starts
a whooshing noise
the sound is very faint
but distinct from everything else
the noise gets louder
jacobs sure hes hearing it now
he looks at the greyhaired man
the man catches his eye and the two of them stare at each other for a heartbeat then jacob turns away
the man returns to his book
and jacob immediately turns back to him
do you hear that
the man gives him an annoyed look as the whooshing gets louder
i dont hear anything
the man turns back to the book as the sound gets even louder like its coming closer
jacob squirms in his seat sneaks a look at the man again
how can he not hear that
a stewardess walks by and jacob catches her attention
the whooshing is completely obvious now
the greyhaired man tries to ignore the two people talking over him
what is that sound
thats just the engines sir
no its different
its not the engines
its getting louder
the man sighs the stewardess smiles patronizingly
were just gaining altitude to get above some rough weather
thats the sound of the engines speeding up a bit
the stewardess walks away as jacob sits back and starts to bite his nails
the whooshing is really starting to blare now
he looks between the seats in front of him twists around to look behind
he snaps back to the greyhaired man
jacob contd cant you hear that
losing patience look kid
will you relax
its just the damn engines okay
the man glares at him and jacob backs off
the sound has grown deafening
jacob grinds his seat like hes going mad
he looks at the closed window
he reaches out his hand grabs the handle then rips up the shade for all to see a coming right at us
the planes crash
impact decompression explosion
the hull of the cabin buckles violently moaning like a dying elephant peeling inward revealing red and green striping on the outside
a huge wing section rips through the structure barely missing jacob taking the greyhaired mans head clean off nailing the stewardess in the gut and shoving her body across and
out the other side of the cabin
and jacobs seat drops down sending him and us into like an intricate ballet jacob his body strapped to his chair tumbles away from the dc and as they seem
to merge and bend into some kind of mutant dc wings and tails wrapping around each other as debris blooms out like a flower and together they explode a fiery ball lighting the nighttime clouds and jacobs shrieking face
and jacob falls and falls and falls his hair sticking straight up from the blasting wind
thats when corpses start falling past him
the captain of the plane the stewardess her body bent in half the greyhaired man his head gone but his book still in his hand
more men women crew people and children
but these children arent dead bodies
two little girls and one little boy all dressed in white plummet down next to jacob head first like high divers
and theyre singing one two freddys coming for you
the children turn around in the sky so that they are travelling feet first
the little boys pants puff up and the girls skirts poof out and rip upward the wind taking away their clothes and their skin and their bodies and their hair
the children contd three four better lock your door
leaving three tiny skeletons taunting and laughing as jacob screams and covers his eyes
the children contd five six grab your crucifix
and the skeletons sprout wings leathery and veiny the wind catching them and sending them up and away as their voices echo in the sky
the children contd seven eight gonna stay up late
jacob takes his hands away from his face and starts to frantically pull on his seat belt
snap it flies off his back and miraculously turns into a parachute
rope swirls into the air the wind grabs the canvas and jacobs body slows with a violent jerk
but at least hes not falling anymore
jacob catches his breath as he starts gently floating through the sky
this isnt so bad
this is actually kind of fun
not for long though because his new upward momentum carries him back up to the winged childrens skeletons
jacobs eyes bug out as he rises into them and they start to circle
they move closer and we can see something in their hands jacob twists his body trying to steer his parachute away from the demons
one of the skeletons swoops up to his face and pokes its scissors inches away from jacobs eyes
it sings alone nine ten never sleep again
the skeleton cranks its arm back ready to plunge the scissors blades into jacobs sockets
the arms swings toward him then suddenly diverts up past his head heading for the skeleton flaps its wings and poises its scissors at one of the ropes
the other two skeletons join it over jacobs head
the three of them look down at jacob their boney jaws in a perpetual smile
the skeletons nod yes
snip snip snip they cut away at jacobs parachute as he swings underneath them trying to pull away snip snip
the parachute flutters away the skeletons cackle and jacob plummets
we stay with him as he screams and shrieks and yells and the clouds part and the ground rises quickly up to meet him
the ground becomes a town the town becomes a block the block becomes a house the house becomes a roof and
the ceiling explodes as jacobs body plows through slams down shatters the bed and we immediately jacobs eyes blast open as he sits up from bed in a cold sweat
the worst fucking dream from hell anyone would ever want to have but still just a dream
he takes a few deep breaths as a soft knock is heard at the door
alice johnson opens the door and sticks her head in
shes thirty two blonde with a caring smile
you okay honey
better get cooking or youll be late for school
on my way
alice closes the door as jacob gets out of bed and stretches
sunlight is leaking through the bedroom window shade and jacob walks over to it
he reaches out and pulls up the shade
and theres nothing buy sky
jacob frowns and pokes his head out the window
is once again racing up towards us at seven thousand miles an hour
the entire house is falling
jacob leaps away from the window
the winged skeletons reappear outside dancing in the air cackling with glee
the bedroom starts to shake violently as jacob stumbles into the center
the roof starts caving in and the walls begins to crumble
jacob grabs his head looks up at us and screams
we suddenly stay where we are as the house drops down and we punch out through the roof and our shot becomes an as it falls away towards the ground
we watch as it becomes a small dot and finally impacts on the surface
a mushroom cloud of smoke silently puffs out in the distance below smoke and dust whirl around a huge hole in the earth
splintered shreds of lumber stick up in the air like giant toothpicks
some of the toothpicks start to move
jacob rises out of the destruction charred scraped battered and unfortunately alive
he climbs up to the edge of the crater
he looks back a the remnants of his home
then something starts to happen
something his growing from the crater spreading out
its not a cloud its not smoke its a darkness
even though its night this darkness is darker
it creeps out from the hole fingers of blackness reaching out
what it covers doesnt disappear
it becomes gloomy
the shroud is getting bigger
and its getting faster
he bolts down the streets of the small town in a blind panic
he looks behind him and sees the darkness getting bigger its gloominess covering houses
then whole blocks
everything it touches seems to fall deeper into shadow
jacob comes across a woman walking her dog
he stops and yells at her
get the hell out of here
jacob points down the street
the shroud is swooping down the road browning out street lights in its wake
and the woman doesnt find anything threatening about this
jacob screams at her
dont you see it
and its obvious now she doesnt see anything
the woman is totally oblivious to the danger
jacob shakes his head stumbles away
the woman watches him go as the darkness passes over her
and begins to mutate
her hair gets scraggly her skin bursts out in sores her back grows a hump all of which she doesnt seem to notice
she just shrugs her twisted shoulders
woman contd kids
watcha gonna do
she hobbles away with her dog which now has six legs and two heads
like a bat running from hell he tears through the streets passing buildings that turn creepy and people that become passively accepting monsters
a voice booms out from nowhere
youre too old to run away from home
jacob covers his ears and races out of town
jacob falls onto the deserted road just outside of town
he rolls on the asphalt and looks behind him
most of the town is covered in an opaque gloom
suddenly a cackling sound is heard and jacob turns to its source the town can still be seen behind it the darkness over almost all of it now
the sign reads welcome to springwood
and the numbers after the word population are changing
theyre counting backwards clattering away like an old time gas pump in reverse faster and faster blurring as the thousands digit disappears then the hundreds then tens then
clink the count stops at
springwood is entirely engulfed in the shroud
there is a pause
crash the sign is violently yanked into the ground
it vanishes into the earth and a crack appears at the edge of the road
the crack grows moving out to the center of the highway
jacob watches the crack as it splits wider in the middle of the street and a gurgling sound starts to build
the tar in front of jacob becomes molten
it bubbles and pops
jacob scrambles backwards as something begins to rise from boiling asphalt
its a hat
the hat a fedora to be precise pushes itself up
a left hand burned and scarred pokes out next to it
four sharp blades jut out of the muck on the other side
a head is up now a curtain of tar dripping from the rim of the hat hiding the face
the body beneath the head ascends
the veil of asphalt parts its freddy krueger
he shakes off his layer of tar and looks towards the clouded town of springwood
a look of pure hatred appears on his ragged face
freddy opens his mouth lets out a large breath and then inhales an even larger one
a windstorm starts the source being kruegers own lungs
the gale force begins to yank at the shroud surrounding springwood
fingers of darkness pull up from the town and towards freddys mouth and houses begin to dissolve
freddy continues to inhale like hes never going to stop
krueger is sucking the black gloom into his body and the entire town of springwood is going with it
trees buildings cars picket fences
its all crumbling and fusing becoming a part of t cloud that itself is caught in the nightmarish wind tunnel all piling into freddys mouth
the vortex swirls into krueger
then its gone
nothing but a vacant lot the size of a town remains
freddy turns to jacob and burps it sounds like a thunderclap
dont worry i have a strong stomach
freddy reaches down and yanks up his red and green sweater
he pulls apart his putrid abdomen to reveal his guts and a transparent stomach
inside the stomach a black swirling mass
flashes of houses people homes couples all trapped in horrible anguish
freddy drops down his sweater
freddy contd springwood is mine boy
i dreamed you away before i was born
mom said you couldnt come back
is that true
then she told you all about me huh
lets see what else she has to say
freddy reaches his left hand into the bubbling tar at his feet digs around a bit then pulls out alice
tar dripping down her body
krueger has her by the neck waves his blades in front of her
jacob gets up and runs toward him
freddy pulls a foot up from the asphalt pit and kicks jacob back a good fifteen feet
the boy rolls painful on the hard road
he sits up and screams leave her alone
youre such a mommas boy
freddy swings his knives out pauses for a terrifying beat then swoops the daggers towards alice
as off screen we hear a horrible multiple glitch
jacob shrieks in gut wrenching anguish
were far enough away so that we dont barf at the sight but close enough to see that freddy has impaled alices body on his blades
he lifts her up effortlessly and raises her limp figure right over his head
krueger swings his arm out shaking off alice sending her flying over jacobs head
the body lands behind him
as he runs to his mother
she vanishes just as he reaches out to touch her bloody body
he turns to krueger and raises his fists
a look of sheer rage is growing in him blind insane anger
he bellows you fucker
springwood is only the beginning
all i need from you is a ride
suddenly between jacob and freddy three shafts of light burst up from the road
three figures appear as the light dissipates
theyre dressed in metallic black heavy boots helmets with dark visors covering their faces
one is large and muscular
the one in the center has an obviously feminine figure under her skin tight outfit
the third is a little smaller than the other two with a slightly different face that allows us to see his mouth
theyre the dream police
jacob doesnt know this yet but freddy seems to
the bastard son of a hundred maniacs frowns at the sight of these new apparitions
then he looks past them and smiles at jacob
freddy contd see ya later
freddy violently drops down into the bubbling asphalt pit
two of the black figures start after him
the third one turns to jacob as his partners leap into the hole after freddy
the sound from his exposed mouth is deafening
jacob grabs his ears in pain as we suddenly jacobs eyes snap open so fast his sockets suffer whiplash
hes lying smack in the middle of the road tucked in a fetal position
jacob slowly uncurls his body and sits up
he shivers and wipes his sweaty forehead and thats when he notices something in his hand
its a bracelet a simple band of gold with a larger plate in the middle like an id band
jacobs fingers turn the plate over
printed on the other side is the name of the bracelets former owner alice
jacob has a souvenir
he raises his face and looks at the road in front of him
it goes off into the distance surrounded on both sides by empty fields
this is where springwood used to be
a look of anguish crosses jacobs face as he stares at the desolation
jacob whips his head around in time to see a huge moving van blasting right at him
he rolls off to the side of the road
the truck barely misses him kicking up a cloud of dust in its wake
jacob chokes on the dust
he slowly recovers and looks back down at the bracelet in his hand
he clenches his fist around it as a wild eyed angry look starts to grow on him
he takes a few deep breaths then stands up and walks out of frame
we can see a pickup truck in the distance
jacobs hand enters frame thumb sticking out his mothers bracelet dangling from his wrist
the pickup truck starts to slow down
a sprawling little community with pleasant streets and cheerful houses
it looks a lot like springwood the only real difference being that it actually exists
it also has a sign welcome to rosedale
population a volkswagon bus drives past the sign and stops a couple of blocks down the road from us
jacob steps out of the passenger side and wearily waves his ride goodbye
he shuffles into town
it reads drug addicts not welcome to rosedale
the sign pulls away to reveal a middle aged man with an angry expression mr
hopkins clean up your act somewhere else
he walks along as we pull back to see its a nice looking two story house in the middle of a usually quiet neighborhood
today the home is surrounded by about a dozen townsfolk carrying picket signs no halfway values
and go back to juvenile hall
the crowd mumbles amongst itself occasionally bursting out with a chant in protest
we catch him walking down the sidewalk
he tramps along with his hands stuffed in his pockets and his eyes on the pavement
he looks like he hasnt slept in days
the sound of the crowd ahead of him finally grabs his attention
jacob approaches the disturbance and comes across a young girl standing behind a bush holding a bag of groceries
she is karen miller dark hair sixteen very pretty but with a faraway look in her eyes
jacob stands next to her and stares at the crowd like a zombie
she doesnt turn to look at him as he speaks whats going on
the right of assembly
what is this place
its a home
a foster home
its where you go when things get bad
its the place to figure out what to do next
its a home for kids that no one else wants
beat its my home
karen hasnt looked at jacob once
she suddenly seems to steel herself and walks away from the bush towards the house
jacob is befuddled
he stands there and watches
karen quickly makes her way into the crowd of people head up eyes staring forward
the crowd parts ever so slightly as the irked townsfolk start to heat up
they have an actual human to vent their anger on now
hopkins lays in on her as she passes him
why cant you find somewhere else to shack up
karen turns to him still walking flustered and hurt
what have we ever done to you
karen turns quickly away from him and trips over a sprinkler head
her groceries tumble onto the grass
a hand reaches down to help her
he quietly helps her re bag her groceries as mr
hopkins looms above them
both angry and embarrassed now
hopkins contd look weve been here for years
this is a quiet street
wed just like to keep it that way
jacob cant take this guy anymore
he stands up and faces the older man with a scowl
lighten up mister
smirks and what gutter did you crawl out from kid
frowns we dont want your kind here
what kind is that
we have stand up and take charge
ive just got a couple of questions for you
do you love your parents
of course i do
are they alive
my mother is
whats it like
jacob stares at hopkins
he doesnt answer
he just huffs and puffs as karen grabs jacob and pulls him up to the front porch of the home then into the floor
karen slams the door and takes a deep breath
i can think of a stronger word
are you okay
jacob suddenly gets a little light headed and has to use a wall to hold himself up
karen looks concerned
are you okay
i just havent had much to eat lately
then come help me unpack
she smiles and leads him further into the house
jacob is feverishly eating a sandwich at the table while karen finishes putting the rest of the food away
i guess the sandwich is alright huh
best ive ever had
youre not from around here are you
ive been on the road for a couple of days
do you need a place to stay
footsteps are heard from below and a couple in their mid thirties enter from the basement door
theyre david and mary ross both greasy and frustrated
so we have to get it fixed
we dont have the money to get it fixed
they both start washing up at the sink not really noticing the teenagers in the room
karen speaks up
our plumbing has a bad case of hardening of the arteries
whos your friend
david gives jacob a wary glance as the boy stands shakily
this is jacob
my wife mary
they run this house
theyre helping me and three other ids get a footing in reality before they kick us out of the nest to make room for the next batch
david is looking out the window at the now dissipating crowd
he lets out a weary sigh
if there is a next batch
i see the welcome wagon is back
was there any trouble
jacob came to my rescue
pleasant where you from jacob
upstate about a hundred miles
suspicious i know this state like the back of my hand
ive never heard of springwood
there is an uncomfortable pause
then karen suddenly breaks in
jacobs a little down on his luck
i told him he could stay here a few days
jacob gives here a surprised look
are your parents in springwood
my father died before i was born
my mother shes dead too
you have a legal guardian
been in any state or federal program
just for a little while
so he can get his bearings
got any id
jacob reaches for his back pocket its empty
he shakes his head no
to david i think we can help him out honey
the budgets tight but we cant turn down someone in need
david doesnt acknowledge his wife he just stares at jacob sternly
karen bites her nails
then david sits down and starts to lecture
you got three maybe four days to rest up while we try and find a more permanent arrangement for you
but his isnt going to be a free ride
were part of a community summer work project and eighty percent of the money you make goes to the house
everybody works and that includes you
are you on drugs
if i catch anything stronger then an aspirin on you youre outta here
you got that straight
dinner in two hours
why dont you go meet the rest of the gang
ill go fix up the spare bed in wesleys room
david gets up
he gives jacob a final once over
and take a shower for chrissakes
david leaves the room
karen gives jacob a huge grin
karen leads jacob into the room
there are two teenagers on the couch wesley is a fifteen year old curly hair kind of small
gina is also fifteen brunette hair seems pretty happy
hey guys i got someone for you to meet
this is jacob
jacob this is wesley and gina
welcome to fun central
hes going to be staying with us for a while
howd you get through the blockade
another kid scott pops into the room
hes sixteen dark hair with a tough guy i could give a shit attitude
he doesnt seem to care about anybody in the room except for karen
hows it going
scott notices jacob and frowns
karen is a little annoyed
whos barney rubble
this is jacob johnson
hes a new resident
at least temporarily
he better not be rooming with me
i value my privacy
no i believe that honor goes to wesley
i could use the company
so whats your story
your parents just plain assholes
mellow out scott
give him a chance to settle in
scott reaches into his shirt pocket and pulls out a pack of cigarettes
as he lights one up wesleys cheerful attitude suddenly turns grim
he gets up from the couch and quickly leaves the room
karen gives scott an angry look
is he alright
hell be fine
he just has a problem with cigarettes
his parents used to use them as a sick kind of discipline
thats why hes here
if you know that then why do you smoke in front of him
its not my problem
this really pisses jacob off
these two are not going to get along very well
just what is your problem then
i took care of my problem
thats why im here
scott lets out an aloof puff of smoke and leaves
jacob gives karen a confused glance
his dad used to beat him
one day he couldnt take it any more
he killed him with his fathers gun
jacob sits down on the couch and lets that sink in
gina scootches away from him on the couch then gives him a glum look
everyone here has a fun tale to tell
isnt that right karen
karen is staring out the window
she has that spaced out expression we saw before when she was hiding behind the bush
no one has anything left to say
gina turns the sound on the tv back up as the three sad kids start to watch cartoons
jacob is alone in the dark watching some kind of nick at night b w sit com re run
a cheerful family lovingly banters away on the flickering tube
jacob just stares blankly
karen sleepily shows up at the doorway in a long tee shirt with a glass of milk
why dont you go to bed
i cant sleep
you need to talk
karen gives him a worried look and heads off to bed
jacob continues watching tv with a creepy glean in his tired eyes
the kids are here cleaning up the building
the guys throw rotted lumber into trash bins while the girls sweep up
we catch jacob and scott tossing some debris into a wheelbarrow
jacob looks pretty ragged
lets hop to it
gotta make way for those new indoor tennis courts
the fate of the world lies in the balance
okay this loads full
jacob grabs the handles of the wheelbarrow and shakily picks it up
scott contd you got that
yeah no problem
i dont know
maybe you should think about switching to de caf or something
jacob ignores him and pushes the wheelbarrow along
scott takes some time off to smoke a cigarette
he spots karen across the room bending over with a dustbin
scott lingers on this view for a long time
jacob pulls up with the wheelbarrow and starts to unload the junk
gina is next to the dumpster sweeping
she tries to push a large crate aside by herself but slips and falls
jacob jumps over to her reaches out and grabs her arm to help her up
let go of me
she shakes off his grip and he jumps back
she runs away with a wild look in her eyes as karen steps up to a confused jacob
she doesnt like to be touched
dont take it personally
its not her fault
what happened to her
her mother was a hooker
she forced gina to carry on the tradition
when she was thirteen
jacob looks off at gina with genuine concern
karen gives him the same expression
you look terrible
i just wish youd tell me what happened to you thats all
i cant talk about it right now
ill tell you later
why dont you sit and rest for a bit
the supervisors not around
you look like you could use it
i think i will
he gives her a gentle squeeze on the forearm and karen likes it
jacob spots a pile of wood next to a wall and heads off for it
hes watched the entire interchange between jacob and karen and he doesnt like it
as he goes around the stack of lumber and sits down facing the brick wall
he lets out a heavy sigh and stares at the inside of the building
sits there quietly for a few beats until bricks fly out at us as a gaping hole blows into the wall revealing nothing but blackness and our shot moves through
horrifying apparitions and images zoom by us
gloomy buildings under a pitch black sky
mutants and twisted monsters
shadowy streets and dark alleyways
and five razor blade fingers suddenly ripping right through the sky and down upon us as a voice rings out
jacobs eyes are closed as a supervisor looms above him
no slacking off
back to work
the boys eyes snap open and he jumps to his feet like a babbling crazy man
get a grip boy
the supervisor backs off from jacob as he slowly gets used to reality again
whats going on
thats the problem
now that youve gotten your beauty rest lets see if you can change it okay
jacob calms down and nods
he walks away snatching a nervous glance at the perfectly normal brick wall
we watch as various lit windows go dark and the residents of the house go to bed
wesley is getting in bed
jacob is sitting in a chair staring out the window
wes switches off the lights and turns to jacob
arent you going to bed
im not tired
if you looked any more tired youd be dead
jacob cracks a weary smile in the darkness
you gotta sleep man
you know people dont even really know why we sleep
they havent found any physical reason for it
but they do know that you go nuts if you dont
sharks dont sleep
they cant pump water through their gills on their own
they have to always keep moving
if they stop they cant breath
if they go to sleep they die
youre not a shark
im just a kid
dont worry about me wes
go to sleep
wesley shakes his head and gets under the covers
jacob continues to stare out the window desperately trying to keep his eyes open
the trees sway quietly in the breeze outside
there is a pause
then we are suddenly pulled through the window smashing glass careening back into we sail through the gloomy air over the creepy buildings
and suddenly dip down right for the street and end up cruising three inches off the asphalt really ripping down the road until we grind to a sudden halt
right in front of freddys feet
our shot tilts up
freddy looms above us and grins
you cant stay awake forever boy
he laughs his mouth gaping wide and then splitting open impossibly wider
something starts pouring out of his mouth right at us
hundreds of giant bugs spew down upon us covering us completely as everything goes to black and we his eyes are open his mouth is hanging in a silent scream
it looks like his head is about to explode
he lifts his hand up to his face
hes holding an eight inch long monster jacob screams out loud this time tosses the mutant insect away
it lands on a windowsill and escapes out the opening
jacob jumps to his feet sending his chair tumbling backwards with a crash
he shakes and moans a little drool dripping down his chin
wesley sits up with a start and stares at jacob
i told you youd go nuts
jacob catches his breath gives wes a dead serious look
get everybody else
i have to tell them something
in the middle of the night
i mean it
wesley is shocked by jacobs manic state and jumps out of bed
five kids are gathered around the room in various stages of sleepy grumpiness and annoyed disbelief
jacob paces back and forth
i dont get it
is this guy alive or dead
he haunts your dreams and if he kills you you die for real
wesley the most gullible of the group looks pretty scared
i havent dreamed of him
i have nightmares like you wouldnt believe but never of this guy
thats because this all rates an eleven on the bullshit meter
i dont know why we have to listen to this crap
youre scaring the hell out of wes here
keep your voice down
it doesnt matter
the rosss sleep like rocks which is what we all should be doing
i know this sounds crazy but i swear its true
i went to bed one night and woke up in the middle of the road
freddy krueger killed my mother blasted my whole town into his nightmare and worst of all i think he wants to use me to kill more kids and bring more
towns into his world
im not sure
i think im some kind of carrier
hes somehow inside me and as soon as i fall deep enough into sleep hell be let loose
you guys were great to take me in
i just dont want to thank you by getting you all killed
scott gets up and goes to a desk
he pulls out a map and shows it to jacob
show me springwood
jacob looks at the map and points
scott contd theres nothing there
thats what ive been trying to tell you
theres never been a town there
thats how you see it
i was part of the nightmare so im the only one who notices the difference
scott stares at jacob
he actually grows sympathetic
you dont have to convince us that nightmares are real
everybody in this room has been through one
and some of us are still living it
but the thing is we know its just in our heads now
it can be just as bad as the real thing was but its still only a memory
it cant hurt us physically unless we do the hurting ourselves
and we dont want to see you get hurt
we know it gets crazy
and well help out the best we can
but this is just too hard to believe
jacob plops down on the couch defeated
he hangs his head while the kids start to get up
wesley gives him a pat on the back as he scott and gina leave
but karen is still here
she sits next to a window with a faraway look in her eyes
jacob looks up at her
you dont believe me either do you
i dont know
why are you still here
im not sure
i guess i guess i see a lot of me in you
feels good to see someone more fucked up than yourself huh
karen smiles and sits down next to him
that must be it
but you havent told me why youre here at this place
i cant talk about it right now
do you want me to stay with you
yeah thatd be great
dont let me sleep okay
ill do my best
she reaches for the remote control and flicks on the tv moving a little closer to jacob when she sits back into the couch
the two of them watch the screen with glassy eyes
karen contd thank god for cable tv
they continue to watch in silence as karen takes hold of jacobs hand
we are on karen as she sleeps curled up on the couch
jacob is in the background putting on his shoes
he has a brown paper bag with him
jacob gets up grabs his bag and steps over to karen
he gently pulls a lock of hair away from her face
then he heads for the front door
jacob walks out the door and closes it behind him
he crosses to the porch steps and stops
he has to hold onto a porch column just to keep standing
karen appears behind him
jacob jumps a bit
where are you going
he cant hurt you if im gone
maybe ill go to the desert or something
ill lie down in the middle of nowhere and finally get some sleep
krueger can feed of the dreams of snakes and vultures
youre just going to take off then
karen has an angry expression on his face
jacob gives her a pained look
dont do this to me
im just trying to protect you and the others
you blow into town and then blow right out
i dont understand why youre so mad at me
you just dont get it do you
karen though still very angry looks like shes about to cry
jacob confused sits down on the porch steps
jacob contd maybe im crazy
running away doesnt help
he sighs and smiles a bit
and youre going to convince me huh
this time karen smiles
jacob looks at her and sighs
then he yawns
karen contd im going to make some coffee
you promise not to move
karen jumps and heads back into the house
jacob stares at the grass in front of him his eyes heavy
a bush sits there doing nothing
until it suddenly comes to life
its leaves start to shrivel the lawn turns brown the sky turns dark
everything changes and turns into were in a different front yard in a different town in a different dimension
the mutant bush starts to change sprout legs grow arms become human
her body takes shape as she reaches out a pleading arm to us
shes fully formed now
and freddy bursts out from the ground behind her
he grabs alice reaches his knife arm around alice contd no o o o o
her words are cut off as krueger jams his blades in her gut and we re live her death once more
but its even worse this time
blood pours from alice like a burst fire hydrant spraying and showering the entire nightmare lawn like a human sprinkler
say it dont spray it huh jacob
come and join the fun
jacobs voice rips through the scene as everything starts to jacob is lying in the grass violently shaking
karen drops down next to him
his body jerks around as if caught in the throes of an epileptic seizure
he shrieks ignoring karen completely and continues to shriek and scream and yell and shake
like hes never going to stop
were directly across the street from the foster home as jacobs cries echo through the neighborhood
hopkins opens the front door
he sees whats going on scowls and yells into his house
i told you
its an overdose
jesus christ i saw this coming
he watches the commotion growing across the street and never once moves to help
jacob is being strapped into a stretcher babbling incoherently
the residents of the foster home stand off to the side while neighbors gawk from the street
karen is next to the ambulance guys looking frantic
dont let them take me
jacob itll be alright
calm down kid
well take care of you
jacob grabs the ambulance guy
you dont understand
let me go
the ambulance guy straps jacobs arm down
ross grabs karen and pulls her away as they start loading the crazed teenager into the ambulance
scott shakes his head
wesley looks terrified
gina keeps her distance from any human
karen cant take it and runs into the house
this is just what we need
the ambulance drives away as the gathered crowd stares at the kids angrily
jacob yells and struggles as an ambulance guy prepares a syringe for injection
dont fucking put me under
youll set him free
the ambulance guy holds jacob down and slams the needle home
jacob screams and his eyes start to glass over
jacob contd hell kill them all
jacobs head starts to go limp
a voice rings out in the van a voice only jacob hears every town as an elm street
laughter echoes as jacob turns his head towards a window
the ambulance zooms by
all is quiet for a second until crash
a twisted rusty sign post erupts out of the sidewalk and settles at an ugly angle
its an elm st
we pull back from a wide awake jacob who is now suddenly alone in the van
outside the window there is only darkness
jacob twists and struggles on the stretcher as clang
the ambulance doors crash open revealing blackness and ka boom
the stretcher is shot out of the van like a cannonball
the stretcher with jacob blasts through a wall and starts to race across the floor of the building that jacob had been sweeping up the day before
it careens along actually taking a few turns like it has a mind of its own heading for a shallow pit in the middle of the warehouse
the stretcher hits the pit drops a bit swings up violently and stops in a vertical position like a rake that has been stepped on and a black human shape
shoots out of jacobs body from intertial force staying upright as it slides across the floor spins stops then changes into freddy has his hands on his hips and a grin on his face
thanks for the lift kid
he saunters up to jacob who is still strapped to the vertical stretcher
krueger waves his knives and wiggles his tongue
what do you want from me
i already got it
the rest im going to get from your new little friends
leave them alone
its my duty to clean up the neighborhood
what have you done with my town
aw poor babys homesick isnt he
well all be one happy family soon
wanna be the first recruit
freddy raises his blades and swings
the straps around jacob drop away as his body falls to the floor
he scrambles to his feet and starts to run
freddy laughs as he heads for a door
before he gets there the door swings open and freddy leans casually in his way
freddy contd whats the matter
dont want to be part of my expansion project
jacob turns right around and races back across the warehouse
jacob races around to the other side and theres krueger again
freddy contd today rosedale
tomorrow the world
over my dead body
as you wish
freddy cranks up his knives and looms over jacob
and three flashes of light blast out behind the boy
jacob rolls away as freddy holds up an arm to block the blinding glare
the light fades
the dream police have arrived
well call the small one sound cop
he stands there motionless as a loud and horrible growing noise emanates from his clenched teeth
this guys bark is worse than his bite
the female in black is blade cop
from nowhere she produces two nasty looking knives one in each hand
she spins the blades in the air like an expert samurai
the large one well call power cop
he reaches out for the dumpster and with one hand sends it tumbling away with a crash
freddy contd uh oh
too many parking tickets
the dream police fan out around krueger surrounding him
power cop leaps at freddy grabs him and tosses him in the air
freddy tumbles rolls and bounces right back up on his feet
right next to blade
she swings her knives
swings hi own blades at her
freddy spins again
right towards sound cop
the short man in black opens his mouth and a sound like a foghorn at a rock concert blares out
the force of it hitting freddy like a fist
freddy bounces back
and once again he nimbly pops up
he glares at the dream police
freddy contd dont interfere
we have to
its our job
get a new one
and freddy starts to spin
slowly at first then faster and faster until his image starts to blur
the police circle the whirling image holding back to see what will happen next
krueger stops spinning
and his clothes are different
his red and green stripes have been replaced by black and white ones
there is a number printed across his chest
hes dressed like a convict
freddy contd time to blow this joint
a hole is suddenly blown in the high ceiling above krueger
the building is suddenly filled with the beams of moving spotlights and the sound of blasting sirens
a rope falls down through the hole
freddy grabs it and whoosh
hes yanked up
freddy contd youll never get me coppers
and away hes gone
after a few seconds the spotlights fade away and the sirens die
the dream police look up seemingly unsure of their next action
then power cop kicks a pile of lumber sending wood flying dozens of yards away
sound cop shakes his head
blade looks frustrated
jacob steps up behind them
just who the hell are you guys
the black clad trio turn around in unison and look at jacob
there is a pause
then were the dream police
jacob almost laughs
the dream police
didnt you hear her man
power cop turns to sound cop and flips up his visor revealing his face
hes a sixteen year old black boy
heavyset features sweat dripping down his cheeks
hes kincaid from nightmare
and hes pissed
power cop contd we try and save this guys ass and then he goes off and cops an attitude
sound cop flips up his helmet
hes joey the former mute boy
i think youre the wrong guy to talk about attitudes
this is getting us nowhere
she takes her helmet completely off long dark hair tumbling over her shoulders
its taryn the ex junkie
these three theyre the dream warriors
or at least they used to be
may i butt in here and ask some more stupid questions
the three of them stop bickering and turn to jacob
blade walks up to jacob
her two partners assume position behind her
we dont know much more than you do
what we do know is that weve been recruited
we dont know
i think thats obvious
the shits about to hit the fan
kruegers discovered new powers
hes ripped a hole between dreams and reality
our own powers have been amplified
we only hope it will be enough
but were going to need your help
what can i do
just who are you guys
blade puts her helmet back on
her face turns grim
we were like you
we fought freddy krueger many years ago
our souls were released from his grip
no were back to try again
all three of them drop their visors down at the same time
i still dont understand what
jacobs voice starts to garble
he keeps trying to talk but the words come out twisted and clipped
he raises a hand to his throat
the hand is transparent
jacob looks at his body as it slowly starts to disappear and now hes completely mute
freddy krueger cant hurt us anymore
because were already dead
jacob vanishes completely
jacob opens his eyes
hes in bed dressed in a white smock
a doctor stands next to him with a clipboard in hand
whats going on
just relax everythings fine
thats what you say
youre lucky youre here instead of juvenile hall
you put up quite a fight
but youre clean
no traces of drugs or alcohol in your blood
i couldve told you that
jacob starts getting out of bed
hold on there
you said i was fine
i have to get back
my friends are in trouble
i said you werent on drugs but i never said you were fine
youre suffering from extreme fatigue and stress that manifested itself into one hell of an anxiety attack
at least thats what we hope it is
you had a major seizure jacob
you dont understand
this whole town is in danger
were keeping you here for observation
youre not going anywhere tonight
you cant do that
you dont have the right
yes we do
your temporary guardian mr
ross signed all the papers
if youre okay in the morning we might let you go home
until then youre bed bound
we took off the restraints
do you want us to put them back on
jacob drops back in bed
the doctor goes to the door and turns out the lights
he closes the door behind him
and we hear it lock suddenly screaming into the lens with desperation
dark circles under bloodshot eyes hair matted with sweat
a guy not having a good day
we pull back to reveal the man is tightly bound in a regulation straight jacket in a tiny claustrophobic holding cell
we can now tell that the image is in black and white
we continue pulling back gina sits on the couch with a stark white blanket on her lap watching a b w s potboiler with something less than enthusiasm
wesley appears in the doorway checking out the source of the screaming
he looks at gina who tosses the blanket aside and rises frowning
the lunatic on television continues his blood curdling shrieks
nice movie huh
and i came in here to mellow out
she smiles at wes as she exits
gina contd its all yours
wesley murmurs a goodnight then looks back at the screen some orderlies enter the lunatics cell and attempt to sedate him as he thrashes violently screaming bloody murder
it is gritty and awful but somehow riveting
moves to the couch clearly mesmerized by the scene
he curls up absently pulling the white blanket around him as he watches the orderlies in the movie manage to get the needle into their patient who moans and sobs
relax will ya buddy
everythings gonna be just swell
the second orderly leans on a wall and pulls out a pack of cigarettes from the pocket of his scrubs
he bears a suspicious resemblance to robert englund
vaguely tenses at this and absently pulls the blanket more tightly around him to compensate like a cocoon
the second orderly smiles
youve just had a hard day thats all
the orderly produces a pack of matches
he goes to the lunatic on the cot and lights the match off the guys forehead
as the match flares the lunatic screams
he shuts his eyes tensely as the sound is magnified becoming a sudden roar that fills the room
wesley blinks his eyes open looks around from his blanket cocoon
whatever that last sound was it did not come from the tv
beads of sweat line his upper lip as he nervously glances about the room
it remains quiet serene
deciding it was his imagination reacting to the scene on tv wesley nestles back on the couch laying down now as the camera moves to the carpet at the edge
of the room is bunched up as though the walls of the room itself have budged a few inches inward
back on the tv the second orderly lights his cigarette as he hands the pack to the first
they both look down at the madman as they savor their cigarettes
you heard the man wesley
have a smoke with us
wesleys brow furrows reacting to the coincidence
then he stiffens as the two orderlies in the movie begin to hold the lit cigarettes over the lunatics face yeah wesley
have a smoke
our wesley has seen about enough of this movie
he starts to get up fuck this
but finds that he cant move
the white blanket around him restraining him tightly like the straight jacket on tv
he squirms and struggles
wesley contd hey
he struggles harder now but to no avail
hes wrapped tight like a cigarette
on the tv the two orderlies torment the straight jacketed lunatic poking his face with their lit cigarettes
as the lunatic screams the screams become magnified again becoming that loud deafening roar we heard before
wesley squirms in his blanket straight jacket he jerks his head around seeing with each of the mans screams the walls of the room shudder inward and wesleys eyes widen
with horror as he realizes not only is he trapped like a sardine in his stark white blanket but the walls of the room are starting to close in on him
he spins back to the tv set where the first orderly is now looking at us
wesley reacts as he notices something familiar about the mans face
the second orderly bolts into view
he has become freddy krueger
everythings gonna be great
just have a smoke on us
as they hold their smokes out toward us their arms protrude from the tv set with their lit cigarettes
wesley screams and jerks his head away from tv and he hits the floor with an ugly thump
the wind knocked out of him
the couch is gone
as he squirms and struggles to escape his white cocoon the frightened boy looks around and sees that everything in the room furniture carpet tv even the door are all
gone leaving just the white walls slowly closing in on him
then we see that on the floor all around wesley are long cylindrical white objects
clearly they resemble giant cigarettes and wesley wrapped neck to toe in his white blanket cocoon looks just like one of them
he continues to squirm and scream as the walls close in from all sides closer closer pushing the long white things toward him around him bunching them together until they
are in a tight cluster as the room crunches in tightly blocking whatever light source there is until all wesley can do is scream one last time and the screen goes black
after a few beats we hear a huge deafening ripping sound and a new light source appears as wesley looks up eyes wide with unspeakable horror as the giant scarred
face of freddy looms over him grinning and we the room is back to normal but not the occupant
freddy krueger now stands here alone
he has just peeled the wrapper off a pack of cigarettes of which wesley has become one
didnt daddy ever tell you what the surgeon general says
krueger reaches in and pulls the tiny wesley out of the pack
as before wesley is immobile helpless
freddy holds him between two fingers
freddy contd smokings bad for your health
freddy looks around as if searching for something then beams as he reaches into the air and
freddy contd ah
a match made in heaven
he produces a puny version of wesleys father in one hand
his body is straight and rigid like a match stick
freddy places his thumb on the stiff mans head and flicks his thumbnail causing the mans skull to burst into flame an evil grin spanning wesleys fathers face
he brings the father match to what would be wesleys tiny feet and lights the end
wesley screams as freddy tosses the father match and brings the teenagers little head up to his fire scarred lips
the boy is enveloped by the massive cracked opening as freddy takes a huge drag off of wesleys head
where his feet should be the tip of the wesley cig glows red causing wesley to scream with supernatural pain
smoke billows from freddys nose and mouth
he savors it
freddy contd ahhhh
now were smokin
he cackles horribly as he continues to suck on the wesley cig
with each puff wesleys white wrapped body becomes slat black ash
freddy contd whats your sign wesley
it wouldnt be cancer would it
in between his demonic cackles freddy drags on the wesley cig each puff turning more of wesley into ash until all but his head is black and charred
freddy holds the wesley cig out poised to tap the ashes loose
freddy contd now say the secret word and you know what youll win
go to hell
and he taps the wesley cig with his finger
the ashes immediately fall sifting in the air as wesleys head charred and black at the neck where its been separated falls loose
and his severed head falls and falls and falls
we start on wesleys body
eyes closed head normal and everything from the neck down charred mass of burnt torso shriveled limbs all wrapped in the scorched blanket
a body bag hides this ghastly image from us as we pull back
a fire marshall and a cop are talking at the doorway in the background
the coroner is here a world weary seen it all older guy with his nervous assistant whos never seen anything like this
they whisper their conversation as they lift the body bag onto a stretcher
i dont get it
the couch is barely scorched
and how can he burn from just the neck down
thats your explanation
ive seen worse
we follow them as they push the stretcher towards the doorway
our shot stops at the doorway with the fire marshall and cop while the wigged out assistants voice trails off outside
i wanna know
what could be worse than
you know what the gossip rags are going to say
spontaneous human combustion
thats where bodies are supposed to go up in smoke for no reason
its all psychic bullshit
what really happened is called the candle effect
a tiny fire gets started usually from a cigarette
it slowly smolders through the blanket and clothes until the skin starts to actually bake
the body fat begins to melt and liquefy fueling the fire like a slow burning candle
it takes hours but its real
the cop makes some notes
behind them we see scott karen and gina
the girls have been crying and even tough guy scott looks pretty screwed up by all this
the cop nods
he fell asleep while smoking
what a waste
the kids shoot unbelieving looks at each other as the two men walk off
scott and karen head for the front door
a coroners van a fire chiefs car and the now familiar mob of suspicious neighbors are gathered around the front of the house as the stretcher with wesleys body is
a small van marked rosedale general hospital pulls up and jacob jumps out of it
jacobs face turns grim as a tearful karen runs up to him scott following
oh my god
he fucking burned alive
they said he fell asleep smoking
and we all know that cant be
i already told you how it would happen
ross appears behind the three teenagers a wasted look on his face
dont start with that shit
its not shit
david leads them back to the house as the coroners van pulls away
jacob scott karen and gina stand around in various states of utter shock as david tries to console them
we have to be strong
he puts an arm around karen and reaches out to put the other one around gina but pulls away at the last minute when she starts to flinch
david contd we need to pull together and help each other
ross is upstairs in bed
shes pretty messed up
we need to help her deal with this
he would never touch a cigarette
you know that
we dont know anything until the authorities are finished with their investigation
in the mean time no work for tomorrow three day weekend
but monday its back on the job
jacob wasnt covered in our health plan and his little stint at the hospital cost us a bundle
we have to work together or we might lose this place
the kids all nod but not convincingly
they care more about wesley than the house
jacob closes the door
all the kids are here
gina absentmindedly plays with some of wesleys things
when i was put under freddy was released
i know this because i dreamed it
and that dream was real
wesley was his first victim
you said it yourself
how could it have been a cigarette
and how could he
dire that way and not wake up
mockingly maybe the authorities will figure it out
i just cant buy into this
call me crazy
but i think hes after rosedale
the whole place
in my dream he said something about needing a few souls to get the job done
i think he has to kill in order to get the power to suck in a new town
you are crazy
other people in there
in the nightmares
there are three of them
theyre dressed in black
they have powers like freddy but they seem to be on our side
who are they
well you gotta hang in there with me on this one
they call themselves
the dream police
scott actually laughs
this is too much
where are they from
theyre kids that freddy killed years ago
they dont even know how they got there
but theyre somehow patrolling dreamworld to put a stop to krueger
then why havent these guys done the job already
they say they need help
i dont know what or why
i can tell you who needs help
hey im trying to save all of us
i wont believe it until i see it
jacob is crushed that hes not getting through to them
by then itll be too late
it was too late for wesley
the kids stare emptily at wesleys earthly possessions
jacob and karen sit on the steps
across the street we can see window curtains part as mr
hopkins sneaks a wary peek
theyre going to use all this to shut us down
its my fault
you going to try to run away again
its too late for that
i have to stay and try and put a stop to it
its all so hard to accept
i wish i could convince you of the danger you and the others are in
ive been in danger before
that i can handle
this is worse than anything you can imagine
i wouldnt be so sure about that
lets go inside
she stands up
jacob and karen lie in bed clothes on cozy
she stares at the ceiling while he listens
she was great
supportive caring everything a mom should be
except she had one fatal flow my father
you see she was raised at a time when they still had the obey part in the wedding vows
he was always jealous
she couldnt talk to another man without him thinking she wanted to go to bed with him
he never hit me
but the things he did to her
and she would always just take it
she never fought back
hed get drunk and
shed tell people she just fell down or something
then one night
i was thirteen
my mom suddenly wouldnt take it anymore
something made her say enough is enough
she hit back
tat only made it worse
i watched as he hit her over and over
then he knocked her down the stairs
she broke her neck
and when y father saw what hed done he finally became human
he cried over her body for a while then went into the garage and blew his brains out with a shotgun
to this day i dont remember what that final straw was
the shrinks say ive blocked it out of my memory
theres no one else alive who knows what really happened
i have dreams about it sometimes but theres always that blank spot
a missing piece
she stops and closes her eyes
jacob closes his eyes for a second also feeling her pain
jacob opens his eyes and touches karens arm
she finally turns to him
i know nightmares are real jacob
so did my mom
she taught me a lot about dreams
she told me that a lot of people have special dream powers
i inherited some from her and some i have all to myself
she showed me how i could link up with other peoples dreams to actually be inside with them
that sounds wonderful
i dont know
a little hard to imagine huh
i can convince you
were doing it now
jacob smiles gets up and walks over to the bedroom door
karen is confused
what do you mean
i mean were dreaming
you and me
he opens the bedroom door
and theres a forest outside
karen is a little scared at first totally blown away by whats happening
but then she stands up and smiles
jacob contd want to go for a walk
karen steps up next to him and they walk through the doorway into daylight
shafts of sunlight filter through as leaves flutter down from the towering trees and jacob and karen step out of the bedroom door
i dont believe it
were really doing it
but what if im just dreaming of you telling me that
well compare notes when we wake up
then youll know
karen looks around
then she giggles
she likes this a lot
karen suddenly runs away into the trees like an excited little girl
jacob contd karen
he heads off after her
karen jumps out from behind a tree and laughs
jacob contd you have to be careful
did you bring us here on purpose
can you go anywhere you want
its not as easy as linking up though
wow i never knew
she starts wandering off again
jacob follows her
karen contd you know what i like to do in my dreams
she ducks behind a tree
and comes out suddenly dressed as a sharp businesswoman
jacob is slightly taken aback
karen contd i like to be other people
jacob grins as she steps behind another tree and a fireman walks out in her place
jacob is really taken aback this time
karen contd as fireman i can be anybody i want
karen slips past another trunk and comes out as a tall when things get bad it helps to be someone else
i use it to protect myself
the redhead walks seductively towards jacob
he raises his eyebrows as she slinks right up next to him her ample cleavage inches away from his nose
karen contd as redhead what do you think
i think i like you the way you always are
and now karen is herself again
theyre still very close
jacob contd much better
they look like theyre about to kiss
but karen suddenly sees something that grabs her attention
jacob turns as karen runs over to another door
its not the one to the bedroom
it just hangs there in space between two trees
karen contd i wonder where it goes
she reaches for the knob and opens it
but shes already stepped through
jacob runs up to the doorway and it slams in his face
jacob tries to open the door
it doesnt budge
he keeps twisting the knob to no effect
jacob contd karen
jacob starts to pound on the door as we sixties style decore appliances that look about twenty five years old not the foster home kitchen at all
karen is standing in the middle of the room completely disoriented
she walks across to a counter top where she finds a framed picture
its a picture of her karen age thirteen
karen sets the picture down and quickly walks back to the door she came in
karen steps out of her old kitchen expecting hoping to be back in the forest again
then she starts to walk down the corridor
more pictures on the wall this time
one of a woman and another of a man karens mom and dad
karens sure of it now
the center of her worst nightmares
she creeps along to the main stairs
and thats when the noises begin
a thumping from upstairs
a crash like something hit the floor above
more thumping repeatedly and then human moaning the sound of pain
somebody is getting beaten
something is twisting deep inside the girl
her face goes shallow as she slowly shuffles around to the foot of the stairs
and starts to climb them
karen goes up step by painful step as the sounds of the beating increase in their intensity
every hit seems to touch karen as she flinches
shes afraid to go on but cant seem to stop
karen slowly heads for a door at the end nervously reaches out for the knob
karen opens the door
what she thought she was going to see was bad enough but this is worse freddy krueger is in the middle of the room
in front of him is a giant human sized version of an inflatable punching doll the kind little kids hit that keep bouncing back
but the doll doesnt have the image of a clown on it
its a flattened wrapped around version of karens mother a pitiful beat up look on her plastic face
freddy smacks the doll it falls to the floor and just bounces back up
and now the face on it has a new bruise
he hits it again cackling with glee
more bruises develop
krueger looks at karen
welcome to romper room
the face on the punching doll changes again its even sadder now
and its looking at karen
why are you doing this
dont you remember
krueger whips up his finger knives
he rips them through the plastic doll
the doll starts to deflate
the escaping air sounding like a human scream
freddy turns to karen
and a hand reaches out from behind her and pulls her out of the room
jacob pulls karen away from the door and slams it shut
he grabs her hand
they turn to run down the hallway and its changed
there are now no doors and no stairway
the only way out is the bedroom door they just closed
they stop and jacob turns to karen
jacob contd wake up
you heard me
i said wake up
this is my old house
how did i get here
he begins to shake her
she is confused and disoriented
a crash is heard at the bedroom door
and jacob hits karen
its a good slap nonetheless
she stares at him unbelievingly
he whacks her again
karen contd why are you doing this to me
this is a dream
you have to get out of here
im not hurting you only he can really do that
wake up now
karens getting angry
she doesnt know what shes supposed to do
freddy blasts through the door in a shower of splinters
he sees them and grins
gettin kinky huh
jacob turns to karen raises his hand
something blasts through the wall across from them
its power cop
the other wall explodes
blade appears in the rubble
a piece of wall falls down at the end of the corridor
sound cop steps through
karen looks at all this nonsense then at jacob
i think i get it now
she closes her eyes and disappears out of jacobs hands
the dream police stand in the hallway
freddy just puts his hands on his hips and laughs at them
then krueger lays his arms flat on his sides takes a deep breath and begins to inflate
his body expands his clothes and skin stretch and flatten
the bottom half of him getting fatter
he turns into a giant freddy punching doll
power cop jumps in front of the plastic horror and lets loose a devastating swing
the freddy doll swings back and bounces right up again
pow pow pow pow pow
the big dream cop pummels away at the krueger toy as it slaps back and forth between the floor and his fist until shink
two knives appear in blades hands and swoop
she swings them out
the freddy doll tears air blasting out in a grating shriek which screeches and hisses until it becomes freddys laugh
the red and green plastic flutters to the ground as the evil guffaws fade away and we karen shakes jacob awake
his eyes open
they stare at each other for a few beats then karen frowns
you hit me
are you hurt
if he had done it youd be dead
karen is confused
she doesnt know what to make of all this
she looks at a clock
you better get back to your room
we dont want anybody to get the wrong idea
smirks or the right one
karen finally relaxes
she smiles and playfully pushes him
get out of here
jacob reaches under a pillow and pulls something out
its the framed photo of karen age thirteen from her dream
he hands it to her and she looks at it in astonishment
thats something else my mom taught me
he gets up and goes to the door turning back to her
jacob contd dont sleep
she holds the picture tightly staring at it with those faraway eyes
scott comes out of the bathroom in his night clothes the toilet flushing in the b
he goes into his room but stops at the doorway when he hears karens door open
scott ducks behind his door as he watches jacob leave karens room and head for his own
his is not pleased
david ross is sifting through some mail when a heated conversation in the kitchen catches his interest
he stops to listen
karen is finally convinced jacob and scott are looking like theyre ready to punch each other and gina looks scared
im telling you this freddy guy is for real
and im telling you a dream is a dream
jacob was in there with me
and where else was he with you last night
what the hell is that supposed to mean
i have the picture in my room if you want to see it
he brought it out from the nightmare
or from your hope chest
i bet your bed isnt the only thing hes been into
that picture was destroyed years ago
you better watch your mouth pal
im the last person you want to start fucking with
go ahead and be a tough guy scott
krueger will cut you to pieces before you can even flex a muscle
will you two stop it
youre scaring the shit out of me
you should be scared
ross enters the room none too pleased
whats going on here
join the fun
jacob and karen were just telling us about their new excuse to sleep together
nothing happened between us last night
you mean in plain old reality right
jacob and i are going to have a little talk
scott gina and karen grudgingly leave the room
david turns to jacob
david contd your days are numbered here buster
im sorry but
hey i dont know what kind of shit youre shoveling to these kids but its going to stop
my good samaritan instincts have their limits
weve had enough tragedy around this place
we dont need you making things worse with fantasies
you dont understand and i want you to stay away from karen
jacob starts to get defiant
its a free country
this isnt america its my house
ive been checking up on you
you have no record with the police or the state or any of the runaway groups
youre the invisible kid
and if i sense even a little bit more trouble making from you youre going to vanish from here
david catches his breath
he looks like he wants to say more but doesnt have the energy left
he just walks out of the room leaving a frustrated jacob
ross are getting into their car
the engine starts and they drive away
jacob sits in bed staring into space
karen quietly enters the room carefully shutting the door behind her
she sits down next to him
jacob looks at her with weary eyes
youre supposed to be off limits to me
the rosss have gone to a council meeting and scotts in his room
we should be safe for awhile
jacob what are we going to do
im going to go to bed soon
now you want to sleep
i have to find the dream police
i think im somehow their link to all this
they only seem to appear when im around
you woke me up before i had a chance to talk to them last night
i was scared
i have to ask them what were supposed to do to help them
and maybe i can protect gina while im in there
what about scott
hes on his own
i dont mean to be cold but weve done everything to convince him
ginas too scared to understand
i think freddy will go after her next
what should i do
you have to stay awake
thats not going to be easy
im half asleep already
you have to try
she nods her head quietly
then id better get out of here
you be careful
im not going anywhere
she kisses him quickly on the cheek
he needed that
karen gets up and quietly leaves
jacob yawns gina sits on her bed in her night clothes
she holds a deck of cards in one hand while she plays solitaire on her bed sheets
she flips a card from her deck a black nine
she puts it on top of a ten
queen of diamonds
she lays it on top of a king of clubs
takes another card
its the freddy of spades
freddy kruegers image stares up at her from the card
she looks at her stacks
theres no place to put this one
she starts flipping through the deck of cards trying to see if there are any more freddys
thats when a hand rips up through the bed and grabs her arm
gina screams pulls away from the hands grip and jumps back up on the bed
and another hand shoots up from a pillow and grabs her shoulder
more hands appear out of the mattress lunging for any part of ginas body as she shrieks from their touch
and gina jumps out of bed
she leaps to the other side of the room bumping against her dresser drawers
turns to her bed
the multiple hands disappear down into the mattress
there is a quiet beat as she catches her shivering breath
then a half dozen arms and hands pop out from the drawers next to her
some grabbing her legs and arms
some grabbing more intimate parts
pulls away from the dresser
yanks a few drawers out as the hands vanish and she spins over to another wall
where the wall erupts with outreaching arms all around her
two grab her hair
three on each arm
her legs are pinned
gina shrieks and yells and flays her arms
beating the hands with her fists as two grabs her breasts viciously
she starts kicking as one particularly perverse hand burnt and scarred pops out between her legs
aiming right for her crotch and in an incredible show of strength the girl pulls away from the horde
gina heads for the door
hands blast up from the wood floor
she leaps around them
more hands try to block her way
gina jumps around like shes in a mine field made of hot coals
she finally reaches to door and flings it open
gina hits the lifts opposite wall having expected it to be a hallway
the elevators doors close on her bedroom and she turns to see freddy
a razor finger poised over the elevators buttons
he smiles politely
gina is shocked and speechless
she backs away into a corner like someone trapped in a closet with the devil
which is exactly what she is
rising past the terror is ginas realization that everything jacobs been saying is true
freddy contd at your service
he punches one of the buttons and the elevator lurches
gina grabs onto a wall as the lift races up and freddy actually begins to whistle nonchalantly
youre not real
ah but who is
the elevator begins to slow
freddy contd fourth floor
the elevator stops
the doors begin to open
gina leaps for the way out
but shes blocked
blocked by people
they fill the entrance to the lift and start to pile in
all kinds of people businessmen nurses plumbers
and theyre all zombies
vacant expressions fill their dark hollow eyes as the zombies keep coming in
pushing gina back into the elevator
filling it to capacity and beyond
the doors close and the elevator starts to move up
twenty bodies are crammed into the tiny enclosure smashed together surrounding the poor teenager drool oozing out of their mouths breathing down her neck
smashing her so hard she cant even yell for help
gina turns her head
wesley is pressed up next to her
a very dead look on his face
begin squeezed by the zombies around him
one of his eyes pops out of its socket
gina finds the breath to scream and scream and scream
freddy contd eight floor the morgue
the elevator doors open and the mass of zombies starts to spastically pile out
gina having only been held up by the crushing bodies falls to her knees as the last of the monsters exit the lift
she breathes in ripping gasps like shes having a coronary
but she sees the open door
and gina jumps for the exit
freddy grabs her shoulder and pulls her back violently
gina falls to the floor again as the doors shut
freddy waves his fingers down the row of buttons and stops above the very bottom one
this button doesnt looks like the others
its in the shape of a little heart
freddy turns and gives gina a frighteningly serious look
freddy contd time to go down gina
he presses the heart button
and the floor disappears
gina falls screaming into blackness as freddy hangs in mid air and gaudy colors mirrors a cheesy heart shaped bed
ginas body drops down unexpectedly softly landing on the fluffy satin sheets
shes dressed in a skimpy piece of bright pink lingerie
she moans and tries to sit up
and four snake like strips of satin swoop out from under the bed and quickly wrap around each of her limbs pulling her down and yank her tight
thats when the door to the room opens and in walks an incredibly huge fat man
he barely fits through the door as he closes it behind him
puffy cheeks permanent seat dirty fingernails and a lecherous smile
ginas eyes widen
hi there princess
your moms told me all about you
gina screams as he approaches her the ground actually shaking from his weight
fat man contd she said youre even better than she is
he looms above her now
starts to unbutton his shirt to reveal a hideous mound of hairy stomach flesh
gina is repulsed
fat man contd aw come on
im really a nice guy
you know what they say
inside every fat person
kruegers finger blades jut out of the abdomen ad start tearing a huge slit up the front of his body
the fat man starts to fold back as freddys head pops out of the front
is a maniac trying to get out
freddy steps out of the fat man sluffing the bulbous remains aside
he towers over gina
that creepy serious look on his face again
freddy contd now its time for you to put out gina
gina gasps in horror as krueger moves in
but then a knock at the door
i didnt order anything
freddy frowns and walks over to the door
he turns back to gina
freddy contd maybe its complimentary champagne
krueger opens the door
on the other side is a dinner cart and a waiter behind it
the waiter is jacob
jacob shoves the dinner cart into the room and into freddys gut shoving krueger across the room into a tumbled heap
three explosions of light burst into the room
the dream police materialize
freddy jumps up growling
power cop grabs him from behind
blade leaps over to the bed and in a flash of steel releases gina from her satin bonds
jacob yanks gina off the bed and pulls her towards the door
freddy jumps out of power cops grip and the dream police surround him as the two teenagers bolt out of the room
jacob pulls gina along as the hotel room door slams shut by itself
gina yells at jacob
let go of me
she squirms out of jacobs grip and bounces away from him like he has the plague
crashing is heard from the hotel room
a violent battle is under way
jacob pleads with gina
im here to help
he holds out his hand to her
gina shivers than looks into jacobs sincere eyes
sounds of destruction continue behind the door as the girl battles with her worst fear
finally gina takes jacobs hand
lets get out of here
they start running down the corridor together
the entire room is filled with swirling dust and smoke completely obscuring everything from sight
as the sound of breaking furniture and grunting fighters echoes a few pieces of debris bounce into view
and then there is silence
the dust settles and the smoke dissipates
the dream police stand alone in the rubble of a totally trashed room
whered he go
i thought you had him
krueger has escaped
jacob runs gina trailing behind him the two of them trying to find a way out
they pass a door
the door slams open and freddy reaches out grabs gina and yanks her into the room
the door bangs shut
jacob twirls around and runs towards the door
and the door disappears
nothing but flat wall remains as jacob hits it
he starts banging his fist against the side of the corridor
no no no no
the dream police run up next to him
jacob spins around angry
jacob contd hes got gina
everyone backs off
sound cop opens his mouth
an almost visible sound wave bursts forth from his lips and crack a huge hole is punched in the wall
the police leap into the hole quickly followed by jacob
this ones pretty normal
maybe the business suite
and its empty except for a heart shaped box of candy in the middle of the bed
jacob and the rest of the police watch as blade picks up the box and opens it
dozens of cockroaches pour out onto the floor
now jacobs really pissed
you let him get away
hes been at this longer than we have
he can do anything
but we have to catch him in the act to get him
there are rules to all this
theyre not rules
its just the way it is
jacob we need you to bring the rest together
you mean the kids at the home
we need as many of you as we can get
and you must bring them to springwood
you have the power to link your dreams with others
dream of springwood then bring the rest with you
living souls are what he thrives on
living souls are what we need to help stop him
before its too late
before he takes everyone
and every thing
jacob just shakes his head
all is black
except for freddy and gina
he has her from behind his hands locked on her shoulders
alone at last
gina cries horribly like a person who knows death is seconds away
freddy wraps his arms around her hugging her
and he keeps wrapping his arms
they stretch and elongate wrapping once around his body and then around hers again
and then again
freddys rubber limbs curl around and around an around ginas quivering body
spiraling up and down
encircling on all sides on every part of her touching and grabbing her everywhere
until kruegers arms cover her entirely
freddy contd touching isnt it
and he starts to squeeze
gina gags as freddys snake like embrace tightens around her draining the life out of ginas body
jacob wakes with a start as the entire house around him shakes
jacob jumps out of bed
jacob dashes down the corridor
karen comes out of her room
is it an earthquake
they run to ginas room and fling the door open
the rumbling of the house has stopped
ginas in bed her tongue sticking grotesquely out from the corner of her mouth her skin completely blue
jacob and karen run to her to try and help
ginas already dead
but freddys not quite done with her yet
jacob and karen watch as ginas chest caves in
karen the coroners back the neighborhood gawks
jacob karen and scott sit on the front steps in a daze
but this time there are police barricades up
in another part of the front yard we can see mr
ross with a social worker mr
mary ross is crying while her husband david is having a heated argument with silverman
the kids watch on gloomily
the social worker leaves as mr
ross walks over to the kids
mary walks right by them and into the house to broken up over something to talk
pack your bags kids
youre kicking us out
theyre taking you away
they say its for your own good
they cant do that
yes they can
they consider mary and i possibly unfit to act as foster parents
theyre going to find temporary homes for you until this mess is straightened out
im so very sorry
karen runs up to david and hugs him desperately
he holds her
theyre not calling it an accident this time
they dont really know what to call it
karen lets go
scott stands up
whats going to happen to us
youll be alright
whats going to happen to you
i dont know
theyre thinking of pressing charges
a car from juvenile hall will be here in an hour
he leads them up the stairs
a sign reads rosedale youth center
silverman the social worker is talking to the teenagers
karen and scott look understandably worried
jacob looks like the world just ended for him
im sure most of you know how this works already
youll be assigned new foster homes tomorrow afternoon
tomorrow morning the police will be talking to you regarding the matter at the old house
what about it
anything you know
are we considered suspects
youll talk to the police about that
well all try and work this out
will we be able to go back to the rosss
i dont know
youll have a place to stay in the mean time
will we be together
we dont have anybody willing to take more than one person
im afraid youll be split up
hey you can visit each other
youll be in the same town
if its still here
silverman frowns at that last comment as the kids get up to leave
the teenagers walk glumly out of the office
jacob is still strangely silent not making eye contact with anyone
jacob what are we going to do
what do you mean nothing
jacob walks on ahead of them
karen is flabbergasted
she stops and just stands there with scott
the two of them watching jacob walk away
looks like your hero just gave up
and karen still cant believe it
jacob is sitting on a bench looking like a beaten man and hating himself for it
karen and scott step out of a door
they watch him for a few seconds
then karen walks towards jacob
scott stays behind and lights up a cigarette
how can you do this
im not doing anything
after all weve been through you just throw in the towel
because were fucked
the last thing the dream police told me was that they needed all our help
even if we werent about to be split up there arent enough of us left to make a difference
how do you know that
but its all just too much
ive tried so hard and nothings worked
im so tired
jacob puts his face in his hands
jacob contd ive had enough
so youre just going to give up
ill bet thats something your mother never taught you
that hit home
jacob uncovers his face
his id bracelet dangles from his wrist
he looks at the bracelet
alice glints in the setting sunlight
jacob looks up at karen
karen contd we still have one night together
and were not going to waste it
jacob stands up
jacob paces back and forth in front of scott and karen
scott we need you
look i dont know whats going on anymore
two of my friends die and now you tell me i have to drop into dreamland with you guys to do battle with the dude that did it
well have help
i almost forgot
the sleepy squad
ill make you a deal
i told you i wouldnt believe this stuff unless i saw it
if i understand this correctly all i have to do is fall asleep and you just whisk me into the action
if that happens if both of you show up in my dream ill help you out
if nothing happens then ill get a good nights sleep and laugh at you in the morning
you got a deal
and you wont be disappointed
im going to be sleeping in the girls dorm
will you be able to bring me in
i hope so
then i got to make sure we all end up in springwood
the old stomping ground
only right now its not a very pretty place
what do we do when we get there
play it by ear
and try and stay alive
a social worker sticks his head into the lounge
half hour til lights out everyone
the kids get up and start for the door
off we go
into the wild black yonder
scott shakes his head as they leave
karen lies in bed under the covers
she holds the picture of herself thirteen years old
she stares at it
still that missing piece
karen puts the picture on a nightstand and closes her eyes
scott lies on the top of a set of bunk beds
jacob is on the bottom and already looks asleep
hes still awake
maybe hes starting to believe some of jacobs ramblings because he nervously fidgets in bed
years ago some sicko gets fried and now he comes back to stick it to you when youre snoozing
stupid bedtime story
he sighs looks at his wrist but his watch isnt on
then scott contd hey mr
creepoid you still up
a beat yo jacob
theres still no answer
scott rolls and peeks over the edge of the bunk bed
and jacobs not there
scott contd huh
scott sits up looks around
and falls right through the middle of his bed not appearing underneath the top bunk
he just disappears
scott falls out of a tree and lands with a thud
he groans slowly gets to his feet and takes in his surroundings
the road is dark and desolate
the street lights emit a grim brown glow and there are no stars or moon in the sky
sounds echo through the trees and buildings
weird moans odd gurglings eerie whispers and an occasional unearthly this does not comfort scott
oh this is lovely
he starts cautiously walking down the sidewalk
something flies by with a flapping
was it a bird or a bat or what
its already gone
then a craggy voice calls out from behind a tree
scott is understandably jumpy
the dark figure of a bum starts walking towards him
scott backs away
can you spare some change
um well let me see
scott starts sifting through his pockets and the bum steps out into the light
he has three eyes and a hump back
scott contd holy jesus christ
the bum grins and scott starts stumbling away his voice trailing off scott contd ill catch you next time buddy
the mutant bum belches
karen rounds a corner
she walks nervously down the middle of the street
there are no cars and she wants to keep as far away as possible from the houses on either side
there is a creaking sound from one of those houses
karen turns her head to look
a craggy old woman is rocking back and forth on her front porch
shes eating something something stringy and slimy
she munches away with a vacant look in her eyes
the something in her hands moves slightly
the old womans meal is still alive
karen gags and walks faster
and a panting sound is heard like two dogs
someone is walking their pet down the sidewalk
its the mutant woman from jacobs opening nightmare straggly hair oozing sores limping
the source of the multiple paintings is her single dog all two heads of it
the mutant woman waves unpleasantly at karen
karen whimpers and starts to run
she stumbles quickly down the street
we catch fleeting glimpses of other horrors twisted shapes bent shadows
karen rounds a corner and screams when she bumps into someone
its scott out of breath from his own sprinting
talk to any of the neighbors yet
theyre a swell bunch of folks
real friendly too
so this is a dream
and im in it with you
maybe im just dreaming bout being here with you
wouldnt be the first time
i tired that one already
come on we have to find jacob
scott nods and they take off down the street
a cat with three tails slithers by
jacob is standing motionless in the middle of the road
he stares down into the darkness a wooden expression on his face
karen and scott are running up behind him
so this is the place huh
jacobs eyes are steady
he hasnt yet acknowledged the others presence
he eyes are fixed on the gloominess in front of him
a look of vengeance beginning to grow as our shot moves in on him
karen and scott are next to him now
they stand silently with jacob for a few seconds
then what now
scott are you with us
a deals a deal
then we wait
and not for long
in three bursts the dream police appear directly across from the teenagers
scott and karen jump back
jacob hold his ground
the threesomes stand face to face in two parallel rows
scott contd nice outfits
is this all
all thats left
itll have to do
we can always come back later
like when its daytime
its always night here
whats the plan
we need you to draw him out
were supposed to be bait
then lets do it
a huge brick wall ten feet high and spreading out across the street and through the houses blasts up from the asphalt
right between the police and the kids
the three cops crouch into battle positions
the three of them have hardly any time to react before three perfectly round holes open up underneath each of them
and scott jacob and karen fall into darkness
sound cop stands up and his body begins to vibrate
a new noise emits from his mouth a high pitched squeal
and like the walls of jericho the bricks in front of them fall apart and tumble to the ground
dust settles and the police walk over the rubble to the other side
the kids are gone
the dream police break formation and scatter
a hole opens up in the road and whoosh karen is elevated up into the scene and the hole seals up instantly
she jumps a few feet and drops to her knees holding onto the ground
she looks up at a street sign
it reads elm st
karen stands up and heads down the road
another hole and voom jacob is shot up into the street
he spins around trying to get his bearings
it doesnt take him long
he knows exactly where he is
he starts to run and we follow him
jacob jumps over a procession of rats making their way across the street and just keeps on sprinting
until he reaches a certain house
he catches his breath as he looks at the building pain registering on his face
jacob contd mom
jacob runs towards the house as our shot moves in close to the mailbox and ate name printed across it
it reads jacob bursts through the door
he turns on a light switch
a lamp sputters into semi life and keeps sputtering casting a candle like glow over the interior
cobwebs and dust cover everything
rats and tarantula spiders skitter about
jacob grits his teeth and walks in deeper
scott blasts out of the asphalt
he staggers for a few seconds from the ride then looks at the building in front of him
a puttering neon sign ospringwood tavern marks the local saloon
muffled music and voices seep through the cracks of the double doors
scott looks around then shrugs
he heads for the entrance
dump is too clean a word dive is too nice abomination is more like it
a greenish haze covers everything
instead of sawdust on the floor there is a collection of debris that looks like a compilation of human teeth crushed bugs and pools of unmentionable goo
then theres the people
imagine any profanity any obscenity any blasphemy add them all up then double them
it wouldnt even come close to the patrons of this joint
they dance they yell they drink bloody bubbling mixtures
theres a guy to the right that doesnt seem to mind that half his brain is showing
that girl over there has no jaw
in a booth is a couple that are connected at the lips
a ventriloquist on stage is entertaining the troops with his hand up the back of a real body
scott steps through the door and blinks about a dozen times
then he decides that the smart course of action is to turn around and go right back out
a mutant bouncer half his face a skull blocks scotts way
two drink minimum
ah thats okay
i think im underage anyway
two drink minimum
two drink minimum
the bouncer with the limited vocabulary seems adamant
scott backs off and turns around
he carefully moves forward
a mutant waitress with three breasts slips next to him
can i get you anything
ill just sit at the bar
you call if you need anything
youll be the first to know
scott turns away trying to keep his eyes in their sockets
he slides up to the bar next to a mutant businessman
the mans head is on backwards his arms lean on the bar while his face looks out into the crowd
he has to twist his neck to sip his vile drink
a bartender surprisingly normal looking steps up to scott
whatll it be
um a beer i guess
the bartender fills a twisted glass with a sickly brown liquid
chunks of matter float amongst the foam
scott takes the drink warily and looks up at the businessman next to him
the mutant smiles at him
puts hair on your back
and thats all
the bartender returns
holds one of those half pineapple type drinks in his hand except this one has the back end of a wriggling lizard sticking out of mucousy fluid under a tiny
he gives it to scott
scott contd thats okay thisll be plenty
compliments of the man at the end of the bar
the bartender walks away and scott cranes his head to look down the bar
the crowd blocks his view but we can see a gloved hand with four blades strapped to it tapping nonchalantly on the surface of the wood
he picks up his drinks holding the moving one at arms length and heads down the bar
sits freddy krueger
he sips coolly on some hideous concoction as scott sits down in the chair next to him and lights a cigarette trying to look equally cool
welcome to my favorite haunt
so youre the man
at your service
whats on your mind
a deals what got me into this
bring jacob to me
scott valiantly holding on to his nerve raises an eyebrow
whats in it for me
you dont need to hang out with those losers
youre a take charge kind of guy scott
like when you took charge of your father
suddenly freddy is spinning a gun on the bar with his free hand
leave my father out of this
ill make you mayor of rosedale
after you make it look like this
you can have karen
that was freddys trump card
it really hits a nerve in scott
karens everything hes ever wanted
any way you want her
after a beat okay
krueger holds out his knives
scott shakes his head
i trust you
jacob opens the door into darkness
he turns on the light and a red haze blankets the room
jacob looks up
the dish like ceiling lamp is filled with blood
jacob walks into the room tears welling
he walks by alices vanity her makeup still sitting there as if she might show up and use it at any moment
he steps up to a wardrobe closet and touches the edges of it lightly
he reaches out and slowly almost reverently opens the doors
dozens of writhing snakes drop out of the closet and slither onto the ground
jacob jumps back and screams
then he just stands there in the middle of the teaming reptile mass not giving a shit anymore going insane
his fists clenched his head tilted back as he yells into the air like a wolf baying at the moon
scott steps off the sidewalk and looks up and down the street
he thinks and we move in on him
mayor of rosedale
scott contd what a crock of shit
we pull wider as scott cups his hands around his mouth
scott contd hey
hes over here
move you collective asses
he puts his hands on his hips and sighs
scott contd never a cop around when you need one
a stabbing sound of flesh and scott jerks violently as our shot pulls back to reveal freddy behind scott his deadly fingers buried in the boys back
scott chokes on his own blood as krueger growls
i hate a snitch
freddy pulls out his blades as scott falls forward and with his final breath utters eat shit
his body hits the ground with a thud as a sudden roar fills the air
freddy looks around for its source
and sound cop drops down on him with a smack
the two of them tumble then both jump up
sound cop looks down at scotts body then back up at krueger
his body is shaking with fury and he opens his mouth
the loudest sound yet comes from sound cop
a blast of air at mach smacks into freddy and sends him sailing back smashing right through the tavern wall
freddy flies sideways right through the bar destroying chandeliers as he careens through and punches yet another huge hole through the opposite wall
the nightmarish customers dont even seem to notice
jacob is shuffling down the stairs as a sonic boom of noise echoes through the streets outside
he knows exactly what that sound means as we move in on his face
jacob races for the front door
the dust is just starting to settle as a thud is heard coming from the hole in the opposite wall
quickly followed by freddys soaring body
krueger smashes into some tables and slides across the floor
power cop steps through the hole his fists clenched
freddy stands up and dusts himself off
lighten up bone brain
power cop has no intention to
he bolts over grabs krueger raises him over his head like a wrestler slams him down on the bar and shoves freddy knocking glasses and ashtrays aside until he smacks
into yet another poor wall
krueger barely gets back on his feet when power cop is right on him again
the big man in black swings but this time freddy ducks
a support column bursts into dust
freddy twirls around
and the two of them start to punch each other
its a barroom brawl between non humans as power cop and freddy krueger exchange multiple blows
smack smack smack
freddy nails power cop whose head barely seems to budge from the hits
pow pow pow
power cop lays into krueger sending him spinning and tumbling only to pick him up and start the process all over again
this goes on for a while and krueger is losing
the mutant bouncer finally steps up to power cop to try and put a stop to all this
take it outside
power cop puts a stop to the bouncer with a vicious elbow in the chest
all this gave freddy a few seconds to grab a chair and crack it ineffectually over the cops head
the pummeling begins again
thwack thwack thwack
power cop is punching freddy towards the door
like in an old wester krueger flies out of the double doors and somersaults onto the pavement
sound cop is a few yards away knelt down next to scotts dead body
he looks up as freddy sneers
no more playing around
freddy raises his left fist and it begins to expand
it grows like an inflated beach ball except it doesnt look soft at all
freddy slides up to the side of the entrance and raises his giant hammer hand
power cop steps through looking for blood
sound cop tries to warn him
freddys fist slams down on power cops head
hes actually shoved down into the ground a full two feet trapped at the legs
freddy hits him again
power cop is down to his thighs and he cant get out
a rumbling is heard
freddy turns to see sound cop starting to open his mouth
krueger instantly reaches down and grabs a brick from the rubble and throws it at sound cop
put a lid on it
the brick lands squarely in sound cops mouth stretching it painfully and blocking it completely
sound cop reels from the impact
tries to pull out the firmly wedged plug
freddy turns back to power cop bam
hits him down to his hips
the giant fist swings bam bam bam bam bam
like hammering a nail until power cop disappears into the ground
freddys hand deflates to regular size as he turns to the struggling sound cop
sound cops head is expanding
pressure seems to be building up somethings gonna blow
freddy picks up a boulder from the street rubble
he catapults it with both hands at sound cop
the boulder hits sound cops head and takes it clean sound cops decapitated skull tumbles away with the brick still stuck as a blast of air shoots up from the
stump of his neck with a screech
sound cops body stumbles for a few seconds then falls over limply
freddy laughs and laughs and laughs
until a knife embeds itself in his back
krueger spins around
chunk chunk chunk
three more knives slam into his body as he staggers back in surprise
blade cop stands twenty feet away reaching into thin air and whipping out knife after knife flinging them at freddy
they sail like flying bullets
chunk chunk chunk
krueger falls back from the sheer force of the onslaught at least a dozen blades sticking out of his body
she stands there for a beat waiting to see what freddy will do next
krueger sways looking like an inhuman pincushion
then he grins
his body steadies and he suddenly poses like a body builder and flexes every muscle
pop pop pop
the daggers shoot out of his torso and limbs clattering to the ground
the girl in black steps back and raises her arms
two foot long sabers jut out from her forearms
theyre not held by her theyre a part of her exiting from the tops of her wrists under her clenched fists
she crosses the blades in front of her
freddy contd smiling ah
a girl after my own heart
freddy shoots out his finger knives and they extend to double their normal size
he raises them and takes on a fencing stance
freddy contd en guard bitch swoop clang
a swordfight ensues
freddy swinging his four long knives
blade slashing her rapier arms
they lunge they parry they leap they duck
metal scrapes metal
its a bastardized version of an errol flynn movie and blade cop and freddy are equally matched
blade moves to get the upper hand
blades shoot out of the girls elbows
now when she takes a swing with her fists another sword is right behind it on the follow through
freddy gets caught off guard
gets slashed twice in the shoulder and twirls away
then starts to move faster
blade counters with an equally increased intensity
freddy ducks swoops out twice quickly
a fold of black cloth drops down on blades stomach revealing naked skin and a little blood
they pause for a second
freddy contd touche
and blade becomes airborne putting a samurai to shame twirling her legs up and out as a blade juts momentarily from her right heel chopping off freddys left hand
krueger stumbles back in astonishment as green goo spurts out of the stump
astonishment turns to rage as the two converge again swinging away at an incredible rate
an impossible rate
jacob rounds the corner
he stumbles into the action just as the battling pair are becoming an obscure swirling glinting mass
pieces of them start to drop away
blades foot hits the ground
freddys arm plops away
a broken sword hits the asphalt under the spinning cloud then one of blades arms
as he watches his eyes dart to try to follow the action thats moving too fast for him to see
then theres silence
we pull back and pan to follow jacob as he walks into the scene of carnage
he steps up to two pills of remains one black and flesh colored covered with red blood the other a heap of red and green cloth scarred tissues and pukish
blade and freddy have literally chopped each other to bits the two mounds of body parts steaming in the cold night air
jacob sees something else and walks over to it
its scotts body
jacob kneels down next to the dead teenager
im sorry scott
a cracking sound makes jacob stand up
over to the now silent bar entrance a black fist punches up through the cement
with a crumbling of granite power cop rises from the earth
something else moves behind jacob and he turns then screams
sound cops headless body walks into the shot his arms held above frame over his neck
then sound cops arms lower his dismembered head onto his stump push it down twist it til it stays
with great effort sound cop yanks the brick out of his mouth
jacob now looks off screen at something else something that really makes his eyes widen
we get to see the shadow of what jacob sees projected on the wall of the bar behind him
the shadow of the pile of body parts that was blade cop begins to move
the pieces start to reform leg to torso arm to shoulder head to neck
the shadow on the wall rises and we pull back
blade cop stands across from jacob whole again except for a flash of exposed flesh on her abdomen to remind her of the experience
jacob raises his eyebrows as the resurrected dream police step around him
jacob contd okay im impressed blade whips her visor up to reveal an upset girls face
you shouldnt be
jacob frowns as the four of them walk over to the pile of freddy remains
but theyre not remains anymore
all thats left of freddy is a stack of cloth remnants
a wind rises and pieces of cloth blow away into the darkness
the other two dream police raise their visors looking equally distraught
they all face jacob
blade cop contd this is what we were afraid of
he still exists
were already dead thats why he couldnt destroy us
but hes not dead
hes not alive either
hes something in between
hes not entirely part of reality or part of dreams
we cant kill him
we can wail away on each other until doomsday and not do any good
then whos going to kill this fucker
you have to
how the hell am i supposed to do that
kruegers power comes from his rage and the souls of children
you have to find the original source of that rage and use it against him
this town in its present condition encompasses all evils from all times in its history
the answer is here somewhere
jacob sighs then gets an idea
i think i know where
and he starts to run down the street
we have to find him first
you guys find karen
he disappears down the road as the dream police snap down their visors karen stands in front of a rotted gate in front of a run down building with shuttered
windows and a crumbling foundation
this isnt just an elm street house its the elm street house
and for some reason karen is drawn to it
she looks to her let at the bent mailbox
it has a name plate on it
another one underneath it
its as if people moved in and out and instead of changing the plates on the mailbox they just whacked a new one over the old
karen steps closer to the mailbox
the little sign on the top reads williams
she touches it with her finger and it drops off the nails holding it on rusted away to dust
a new plate is revealed
this one says thompson
karen picks lightly at it and it swings away
the name underneath makes karen gasp
it reads krueger
and theres still another one under that horrible name
karen quickly hits the krueger plate off
the last sign reads underwood
she turns back to the house a determined expression on her face
she kicks the gate open and walks up to the house
weve been here before havent we
but for karen its the first visit as she opens the front door and walks in
she takes in the twisted skeleton of a home for a few seconds and then begins to search it
karen races through pulling open desk drawers rifling through shelves flipping through books
she doesnt know what shes looking for but she knows she hasnt found it yet
the intensity of karens quest increases as she yanks open cabinets and tosses plates to the floor
karen runs up them a girl with a mission
karen flings the door open
nothing but a bed and a set of drawers
no hint as to the occupants lives
she doesnt bother ransacking this one and goes on to jackpot
karen stares through the open door at a childs room a very twisted childs room
she slowly walks in
a bed a desk a dresser
theres a jack in a box with its head torn off
a disemboweled teddy bear
white puffy guts hanging out of it
a clown doll with its face caved in
a hanging mobile made of strange bent shapes
and a pile of more than dirty clothes
karen goes over to the pile and picks through it with her toe
a small pair of pants about the right size for an eight year old
a black pair of shoes
and a little sweater a red and green striped sweater
karen goes over to the desk
there is stack of drawings on it a childs drawings
on one of them it looks like someone was practicing writing their name
freddy unnerwood freddy underwud freddy underwood over and over again
until the final attempt has the last name angrily crossed out replaced underneath by a hastily scrawled krueger
another piece of paper a set of human stick figures
a small one is labeled freddy
the large one is labeled daddy
the daddy figure is depicted hitting the freddy figure
there are more drawings all of them violent the large figure beating away at the small one
suddenly a creaking
hides behind a bookshelf
shes nervously trying to figure out what to do when a framed picture catches her attention on the shelf
its a picture of a tall dark man and a little boy
karen reaches out to grab the picture but accidentally knocks over a glass mug with a crash
footsteps can now be heard tromping up the stairs
someones coming and karens on the edge of panic
she looks around and finds an old baseball bat
she grabs it and runs to the side of the doorway as the footsteps approach down the hallway
karen raises the bat
and jacob appears
karen pulls back with the bat as jacob jumps away from her
you scared the shit out of me
the feeling is mutual
where are the dream police
i told them to look for you
what are you doing here
dont you know what this place is
i do now
look what i found
she starts to drag him over to the desk of drawings
youve got to get out of here
you have to see this
you dont understand
the police cant kill freddy
they literally chopped each other to pieces and hes still alive
now im supposed to figure out how to get rid of him
but i think i found the answer
shut up for a second and look at these
she starts showing him the scrawlings
okay so hes a bad artist
you told me kruegers mother committed suicide and no one knows who his father was right
freddys been pushing all our buttons with our pasts
these are his past
dont you get it
he was a foster child too
she walks over to the bookshelf and grabs the picture of little freddy and freddys foster father
karen contd someone had to have taken care of him
he was freddys father
they were freddys childhood
its where it all happened
but in reality freddy hasnt lived here for decades
like you tried to tell me once before this is a dream
who knows why this is all here
all evils from all times in history
and isnt this where it all started in springwood
on elm street
jacob thinks for a second
its all starting to make sense
but what does this do for us
theres got to be a way to use it against him
okay but were not going to stand around here to figure out how
its too dangerous
he grabs her hand and pulls her towards her door
jacob contd lets get out of this house
they head out to and blade cop is standing in the middle of the corridor
the two teenagers stop
jacob contd thank god
freddys going to show up any minute
a knife shoots out of blades right hand ready for action
but wait a minute her uniform isnt ripped anymore
karen and jacob make their way to the stairs
he turns to blade
jacob contd where are the others
blade walks up to him and stands there
then jams her knife into jacobs gut
blade cop shoves the knife in further until it juts out of jacobs back
then becomes freddy
time to join your mommy
krueger yanks his finger blades out and jacobs limp body falls at karens feet
karen shrieks and cries dropping to her knees to hold him
no no no no no no no
he looks up at her slowly dying
she strokes his forehead while freddy laughs at the sentiment
and jacob is gone
karen sobs so torn apart that she is ignoring the incredible danger above her
but not for long
krueger grabs karen by the neck
its past your bedtime young lady
and he starts to drag her kicking and screaming her body scraping across the floor towards the freddy drags karen in and tosses her across the room
she lands with a thud on the bed
he saunters over to her and climbs up on the bed next to her
gets on top
karen yells and hits him uselessly with her fists and its horrible because there he is pressing down on her right in her face mounting her as if hes going
to rape her
freddy contd aw sweetheart
this wont hurt a bit
she screams as he presses even harder
freddy contd come on
be daddys little girl
and the last three words of that sentence seem to echo through the room swirling around karen
daddys little girl
daddys little girl
karen twists her head away
and freddys become karens father
he looks down on her with a lecherous grin
thats my baby
thats daddys little girl
karen stops struggling
the realization grows on her face with the resurfacing memory
freddys voice now do you remember
and she has an answer for him
youre not my father
but were going to have the same fun
karen stares at him defiantly
and a hand grabs karens father and yanks him away
we pull back
karens mother is next to the bed
and she slaps karens father
he stands up slugs her across the jaw
she tumbles back
karen sits up
karens mother gets up a defiant look just like karens on her face
youre never going to touch her again
ill touch what i want
he strikes her again sending her right out the door
he follows her
karen stands up and runs after them
the man hits the woman down to the floor
karens mother stands up just taking it
shes at the top of the stairs
karens father swings his arm back and karen jumps on him
he shrugs her away violently
as she hits the ground and the wall next to jacobs body
she looks up
and karens father is now freddy again
he swings his fist
karens mother reels from the hit falls backwards
karen jumps up to try and help her reaching past freddy
but its too late
karens mother tumbles down the stairs head hitting bones cracking disappearing into darkness
freddy grabs karen by the neck and lifts her
dangles her over the top of the steps
be honored bitch
youre the last soul i need
and jacob rises up behind krueger
freddy drops karen
she hits hard and rolls down the steps as freddy turns his knives swinging out and slamming jacobs gut one more time impaling him against the wall
jacob gasps out his final breath
ill be back
ill be waiting
freddy pulls his blades out of jacob and the wall
the boys body hits the floor for the last time
freddy turns back to the stairs and looks down them
freddy contd wheres my little pumpkin
he strolls down the steps
freddy walks down and no ones there
karens mom was just an illusion but karen herself dead or alive is nowhere to be seen
freddy contd play time is over bitch
he walks down the hallway
until a booming voice is heard from the kitchen
freddy cocks his head and frowns
voice contd frederick
what have you done
and amazingly a look of fear crosses kruegers face
something about that voice has struck terror in the heart of the creature that fears nobody
krueger turns to the kitchen door
a man steps out of the shadows a big muscular man with a horrifying look in his eyes
a man weve seen somewhere before in a picture
its freddys foster father mr
and he looks pissed beyond belief
freddy shrinks back eyes widening
dont you daddy me
underwood raises his arm and smacks freddy across the skull
krueger tumbles back into the hallway
freddy scrambles to his feet
shakes with dread
looks like a scared little boy
underwood advances on him
freddy turns and bolts for the front door
he flings it open
power cop stands in his way and shoves freddy back back in front of his foster father
punch a vicious blow from underwood sends krueger into where freddy falls over a couch
underwood stomps into the room
krueger scrambles up and heads for the archway leading into the dining room
blade cop blocks the escape
the ripped flap of her uniform proving shes the real one
she kicks freddy back and into underwoods hands
the man picks up krueger and hits him again
freddy contd stop
youre hurting me
freddy wriggles away and opens a window
sound cop fills the window cutting him off
pushes him back inside
underwood grabs krueger and slaps him over and over
gives the beating hes got coming to him
and freddy moans and yells like a blubbering child
shrinks into a corner but is yanked out for more pummeling
power cop stands at the exit to the hallway
blade cop continues to obstruct the dining room arch
sound cop steps through the window and stands in front of it
the dream police just stare in silence
its not a street fight not a punching match
just a ruthless thrashing that would be hard to watch if it werent for the fact that we are all cheering because no one in history has ever deserved it
underwood stops the whipping and stands over krueger who is lying on the ground whimpering pleading for mercy
freddy contd why daddy
what did i do
you took some things that dont belong to you
and with that underwood brings his fist down and jams it into freddys stomach
right through it
shoving it into his very body
underwood violently pulls his fist out and theres something in it
a shimmering flowing thing
crackling with unworldly light
its a soul
its wesleys soul
underwood flings his arm out and lets go
wesleys soul flies into thin air and dissipates
kruegers father brings his hand down again and rips out ginas soul
freddy opens his mouth and shrieks
as underwood raises his arms and begins to sparkle
flashes of light bounce around his body
and somethings happening to freddys too
steam is rising from the creature
his feet are starting to flatten as he lays on the ground and black goo oozes from his pores
and still screaming as he watches his foster fathers image turn into karen
an aura of light vanishes around her body as she lowers her arms with a victorious yet sad look on her face
a look of horrified realization burns in kruegers eyes as he sees karen and continues to scream inhumanly
his body dissolves all of it liquefying into black slime
just a bubbling black puddle of gunk is left
his shriek echoes through the room and everywhere else
then the gunk grows and changes into a dark cloud that begins to expand
power cop runs up grabs karen and yells
we gotta get outta here
karen almost mesmerized by the black cloud spreading in front of her stumbles away with power cop
the dream police and karen bolt out the front door and run down the street as a rumble joins freddys thunderous shriek and the entire town begins to shake
we stay with a shot of the house as the noise and vibrations continue
and the elm street house explodes
the black cloud punches out the roof and the walls sending wood and debris flying everywhere
the rubble flies into the air hangs there for a beat then falls to the ground
all is silent
and the dark cloud turns white
the milky fog spreads out
karen falls to her knees on the pavement not looking back at the destruction one block away
the dream police stop running to turn to face her
karen hangs her head and cries
blade steps forward
it took a human touch
it took knowing his nightmare
karen raises her head as the dream police turn away
walk off into the distance
just as they are about to vanish into the darkness a fourth figure appears and joins them in formation
then they all disappear
her mouth drops open at what shes just seen
what she doesnt see is the white cloud swooping down the street behind her
she just closes her eyes as the ivory mist envelops her and the screen goes white
karen lies sleeping on the bench amongst the grass and trees
her eyes open and squint at the bright light
she sits up and tries to get her bearings
some hair falls into her face and she brushes it away
only then noticing that shes holding something in her hand
she opens her hand and looks down
its an id bracelet
a band of gold with a larger plate dangling from the middle of it
karens hand turns it over
this time the printing reads jacob
she chokes back the tears
we hear a panting o
then a womans voice
you okay honey
karen looks up as we pull back
a pleasant looking woman no longer a mutant is walking her cute dog
she looks sincerely concerned
ive never seen you around
are you new in town
she smiles welcome to springwood
the woman continues on her way
karen sighs and puts the bracelet on her wrist
she stands and our shot pulls up and away as the pretty young girl starts walking through a town shes never seen except in her dreams
