written by george miller screenplay by john collee early draft distant stars with vast tracts of darkness stretching between them
move in on our sun dwarfed in the immense cosmic ocean
you ever feel small
moving in on
the spinning blue marble
fade in a strange cacophony of music growing louder as the familiar continents revolve below us and we spiral down onto vast pristine stupendous
washed with dawn light
a few small black suited figures are moving towards us
like youre no one cos the world is full of us and everyones the same wait a minute
these arent humans
they are penguins
how do you stand out from the crowd
how do you find someone special
emperor penguins all over the place its chaos grand central station with everyone singing to each other
you sing your heart out
thats how mum found dad in the first place follow a female penguin as she waddles through the massive crowd past an assortment of crooning males
trying to connect babe
i got you babe
she ignores him giving it his all when a man loves a woman
she keeps moving until she sees the male of her dreams love me tender love me true all my dreams fulfil
he stands a bit apart from the rest
and what a voice
what a hip movement
she sings along
for my darling i love you and i always will
with them it was love at first song
close up on the two penguins as their necks intertwine
but with me everything was a different right from the moment i was born with infinite care the egg is passed from norma js feet onto wishfuls
first rule of survival get yourself laid before winter
wishful covers the egg glancing up at the darkening sky apparently i only just made it
women are leaving and heading off over the ice
the community resounds with sad songs of parting
afterwards mum went off to the sea to keep warm
dad stayed home like dads do incubating
norma j is having difficulty tearing herself away
finally she pads off after the others
safe home baby
as he watches her dwindle into the distance where huge storm clouds are building
ill miss you
wind comes shreiking across the ice shelf to where thousands of males are huddled ice crusting on their feathers
tell me what it is about the cold and the dark
soon as the sun goes away everyone gets religious the huddled penguins are engaged in ritual chanting when all others leave
when the sun vanishes
the adult males are packed shoulder to shoulder looking downwards at the eggs balanced on their feet
cu on the lead male a caruso
deny the pangs of hunger
seal the gaps
share the warmth
carusos the leader because hes so incredibly old
some say more than but you know how penguins exaggerate
windward penguins peel off and walk around to the leeward side
wishful is among them each one taking his turn to defy the wind
the massed voices rise above the gale the frosty plumes of their breath forming a shared thought bubble
a benevolent as we invoke the great one penguin of penguins pushing back inside ok
but keep moving my dad was never that devout
often his mind was on other stuff
as the chanting builds a little thought bubble appears next to the communal imagination an image of norma j sings i wanna be loved by you alone and nobody else
by you boo boo pee doo wishful raises his head breaking the seal
a little puff of steam escapes amen to that honey
whoa whoa whoa whoa pal
ya lettin out the heat
penguins around him start jostling to close the gap quit shovin
hey watch where youre putting your feet brothers brothers
an egg rolls out of the huddle and onto the ice
i dropped it
wheres my egg
wishful barges out of the huddle retrieves the egg and waddles back into the warmth again
no harm done
i guess he was wrong about a lot of things
pulling back till the powerful rhythmic chanting is drowned out by the howling gale
but i did learnt this from him the power of positive thinking we are moving in again towards the huddle the voices of the great male gathering begin to cut
through the wind blasts
louder and louder until
by the power of our devotions
we turn the world once more
by our devotion to the wisdoms
we bring back the sun
the chanting crescendos awe inspiring as it rises above the sound of the gale and as if in response the curtain of darkness which overshadows antarctica begins to lift from
the curvature of the southern hemisphere
the vast ice continent is brilliantly illuminated once more
the ice itself is moaning and groaning like a living thing
a single crack appears and widens then forks and forks again
the whole expanse of fast ice is disintegrating starting at the sea ice and progressing towards the ice cliffs
somewhere an iceberg breaks free from the face of a glacier and smashes down into the frozen sea below
at the same time
an egg cracks open then another then all in a rush like fathers are calling out to each other as their fluffy chicks emerge to greet the daylight
its a boy
its a girl
what a peach
what a bruiser
amongst the excited crowd of males and hatchlings we find wishful staring down at his egg still balanced on his feet
late opener huh
you thinks its alive
he taps the egg with his beak
bending close they hear a tapping sound in reply
well how about that
wishful taps again
the tapping comes back louder
a tiny foot pops out of the egg
the egg flips and lurches off in a giddy dance
whoa lil buddy slow down
the friendly penguins chick giggles at the dancing egg which finally trips and cracks depositing baby mumble
hopping from one foot to the other ow
freezy fuh fuh freeezy
you ever see a chick move like that before
is he damaged
is he deranged
they gather round staring down at this strange little jigging ball of fluff what
hell grow out of it
shovelling mumble off the ice and into his brood pouch
come here lil mumble
lets get you warm and toasty
mumble snuggles contentedly between his fathers legs surveying his new world
the friends chick ella is staring at him fascinated get him to do it again daddy shh
she disappears under his brood pouch looks up so what happens now dad
we wait a long line of male penguins thousands of them all with their chicks stand staring expectantly across the ice shelf
at the front we find wishful and mumble who is jiggling with anticipation hopping from one foot to the other
is she coming soon
any day now
tell me again what shes like sings a wiggle when she walks a giggle when she talks makes my world go round
mumble does a little soft shoe shuffle
thought i told you not to do that sorry
when i get happy my feet get happy too
well tell em dont
but why dad
caruso waddles past a stern glance down at little mumble as he carries on along the line cos it aint penguin
mist rises off the ice shelf
the males are still waiting with their chicks
over this the sound of chicks crying
mumble between his fathers feet follows his fathers concentrated gaze
gee im hungry everyones hungry son
the mommas are bringing fish soon
long pause whats fish look like
youll see it when she brings one the baby penguins are howling now
anxious fathers lean forward peering into the distance
out of the thickening mist a cluster of little black dots materialises
better late than never
the distant females look exhausted as they totter unsteadily across the ice towards their partners
the males break ranks and rush towards the distressed females
a tumult of re unions as partners find each other
but no luck for wishful
weaving anxiously through the throng overhearing youre not as fat as i thought youd be
it was pretty slim pickings
somethings happened i tell you even the squid were hard to get we had to swim forever everyone split up
a lot of the gals never made it back
wishful is running frantically through the crowd singing all the time in the hope of being recogniosed since my baby left me
i found a new place to dwell
down the bottom of lonely street at heartbreak hotel mumble hippity hops after his father trying to keep up
woah im so lonely baby
im so lonely baby
im so lonely i could
moving beyond the crowd wishful sees a last few stragglers
overcome o honey
you made it
she staggers into his waiting flippers
breathless just tired and hungry is all
it was dreadful out there
over wishful shoulder she sees the infant mumble hippity hopping towards them
but whos this
i called him mumble
mumbles feet start to tap involuntarily then he catches his dads warning look
did she get one
did she bring one back
just a little krill thats all can i see it
give your ma time to regurgitate aw
but isnt he just a darling
yells ecstatically i got one
i got a mum everyone
i got a
the ice shelf is as busy as a freeway at peak hour with males and females are hurrying back and forth from the sea
after that with food being so scarce everyone was busy busy busy
mom and dad were working so hard i didnt see much of them
besides i had school to go to
an efficient caring teacher is giving a lesson to a class of about thirty young chicks grouped in front of her
we will begin with the most important lesson you will ever learn
now does anyone know what that is
many flippers go up
dont eat yellow snow
true but thats not it
mumble looks astonished
whats more important than that its our heartsong miss
the melody you hear inside the thing that makes you different from every other penguin
lets all be very still now and listen
and when you hear your song let it come out
a few flippers go up me
ive got one
sings i cant get no
i cant get no
well michael if you think thats really you
what have you got for us ella
sings voulez vous coucher avec moi
laughs that doesnt make any sense
perhaps you can do better mine is more sort of a
he hesitates as if listening to something in his head
then he sings utterly tuneless like a drum solo
bim bam a loolah a bim bam bom you heard that in there
mumble is still going
titters and sniggers from the class
you like it
dear thats not even a tune
no a tune is like
she sings a scale la la la la la la la la
oh la la la la la a croaky monotone
the class laughs openly
getting worried listen carefully mumble
la la la la la la la la
la la la la la la la la
emphatically la la la la la la la la
but thats what im doing the class fall about in hysterics
genuinely perplexed whats funny
mumbles parents are talking to the teacher
sotto its bizarre
i dont understand it
did anything happen you know
during early development
normal incubation wasnt it honey
wishful shuffles guiltily
well yeah it was a kinda
a tough winter i guess and he did hatch a little late but
at a loss
is there really nothing we can do
of course there is
thats why we have mrs astrakhan
some distance from the creche mumble stands with mrs astrakhan a russian accented remedial teacher
every little pengvin has a sonk
vhen i have feenished your singink vill be givink everyone the goosepeempel
cu on mumble looking up
closink the eyes
deep breathe here in the downbelow
most important part find a feelink
happy feelink sad feelink maybe lonely feelink
mumble closes his eyes
dont think eet
through the whole body from the beak right down to tippy toes
her voice is seductive hypnotic
and then slowly very slowly
she hears a strange tapping sound and looks down
vhat is this
the jiggy jog
dont do eet
do not move muscle
rigid like plank like board
remember the feelink
and be spontanuous
once again his feet start twitching uncontrollably
no jiggy jog
im being spontanuous
not with the feet with the sonk
you vant to meet beautiful girl
you vant to make the egg
ba ba bleckship tvinklestar
la la la la la la la
totally unmusical twinkle twinkle little star
ve go back to the top
forget the body look inside the soul
no notes no sonk only feelink
enormous feelink so enormous it fills the whole body
it must escape or you explode
now open your leetle beak
mumble opens his beak inspired
yes yes lift up the head
mumble inhales his eyes are shining his body is shaking
you take a big breath good and
hes off again dancing like a fool
wild exuberant totally uninhibited and unselfconscious
after some time he remembers himself stops and turns to the mrs astrakhan who is banging her head against a lump of ice
i never fail
follow mumble as he wanders alone back towards his class
he stops some distance away listening to the other kids who are now performing with increasing virtuosity
ella is among them her clear high voice borne to him on the wind
mumble sighs and his little shoulders sink no way hell ever be able to sing like that
its tough when you realise youll never fit in
plus i was beginning to moult a piece of downy fluff is peeling off one wing i couldnt face the class in this mood so i just kept going
music over walk on by as he wanders through the vast colony head down against the wind little feet padding over the ice gradually the colony begins to thin
looking for what
i dont know
a different type of penguin
the noise of the colony has faded behind him
he stops and looks up
and thats exactly what i found
before him a wasteland of discoloured ice covered with broken eggs and bits of feather
there are very few penguins here and the ones he can see are all frankly weird
a penguin walks in an endless figure of eight muttering to himself
another has his flippers wrapped tightly around himself like a straightjacket
a troubled penguin sings angrily
theres no business like show business
cu on mumble
as he looks back to the sanctuary of the colony and then back out over the wasteland not the nicest place in the world but at least you could do
what you liked here
fade in music im free by the who and mumble is off skittering over the rubbish strewn ice little feet dancing to his hearts content until
a shadow passes over him and whump
a huge skua bird twice mumbles size with a cruel flesh eating beak lands on the ice right on front of him
hey whacha doin dere flipperbird
what are you doing
three more skuas descend
mumble is surrounded
oh we just dropped in for a spota lunch
hey hey hey
to others leg or wing
their dark eyes fix on mumble
he is starting to feel uneasy and backs away
im a penguin
de flipperbirds dats you eat de fish
de flyinbirds dats me eat de flipperbird an de fish
right now daint no fish so
you do the math
the first skua moves in on mumble
and dis time im getting the juicy bits
i dont have juicy bits
all bone and feather
feel for yourself
they fall over each other fighting to take up mumbles invitation
hey break me off a pieca dat
smyturn ta pullimapart ya skanky shit squirter
lastime ya pullimapart ya took all the choice stuff
the skuas stop momentarily
every seen anything like this
he does a wild little tapdance hoping to distract them
he knocks mumble down and places his huge claw on his chest
ok boys for once we gonna do dis civilised
the first skua opens his beak to strike
mumble has noticed a yellow plastic band around the skuas leg
whats that on your leg
the first skua halts his attack
interesting you should ask
dont startim on that
he turns and whacks the other skuas over the head with his wing
the flipperbird aksed me a question
fixing mumble with a crazy bloodshot eye
i got two words for ya alien abduction
groaning now of all times always before we eat quiet ya ignorant morons
to mumble a lotta folks dont believe this but deres sometin out dere
not like us
mumble takes a few steps back looking for an escape
the first skua towering over him
aks me how i know
cos i bin capturebyem thats how
i seen em
mumble keeps backing off feigning interest
im sittin on a rock mindin my own business when suddenly
dere onta me
like big ugly penguins fat flabby faces with frontways eyes no feathers no beaks
an dese dese appendages

it was humiliatin
at least those aliens didnt eat you
i guess my cries for mercy appealed to their better nature
so you think i could appeal to your better nature
nice try kid
he opens his beak wide as mumble stumbles backwards and falls into a narrow crevice in the ice
whatcha think ya doin down dere flipperbird
get back up here dis minute
the other skuas move in to help
mumble cowers in the crack as they spear at him with their beaks
come on out witcha
ya sneaky ass flipperbird
they cant get hold of him
frustrated they turn on the first skua squabbling and whacking each other with their wings
what did we tell ya ya leddim geddaway dincha with ya screwy alientalk
hey dont peck me or ill peck you and when i peck you know youve been pecked
fade mumble watches from the safety of the crack as they fight and argue viciously among themselves compared with that school almost seemed like fun mumble stands some distance back
from where the other young penguins are taking school lessons
most days i hid at the back dreaming about the world beyond mumble looks up at a cloud that resolves itself into the unmistakable shape of a fish
as he watches the cloud morphs into something that resembles a whale
then morphs again into
then into the shape of an upright creature with bulging eyes and tentacled hands
we all grew up as the class transforms into moulting adolescents but right up to graduation i never did find my heartsong dozens of mature adolescents
their coats almost fully moulted to reveal the sleek shiny black and white feathers underneath
they stand in a group talking excitedly until the lead penguin caruso walks up and everyone falls silent graduates today you leave the safety of our community for the first
time forsaking the trusted solid ice for the terrible magic of the deep
he couldnt help himself
things are not as they were
for five years now we have known nothing but famine
but you are our hope
upon your survival depends the very future of the entire penguin nation
dive deep swim far
may the great penguinus go with you
with solemn gravity caruso throws his flippers into the air and shouts
yah yah yah
yah yah yah
follow mumble as he returns to his parents
in his adult plumage hes distinguishable by a small birthmark like a bowtie on his chest and a small tuft of down on his head which has not yet moulted
music over schools out by alice cooper dad ma can i go with the others norma j
puts a protective flipper around her son
i dont know wishful
i still dont think hes ready
ill learn to sing later
ill find my voice out there
in the deep
glancing round he sees the class moves off en masse across the ice
heading for the sea
wishful leans forwards pulls off mumbles tuft with his beak
on you go then buddy thanks pop
see ya ma
he races off norma j calling after him calling after remember stranger danger
never talk to a seal
mumble turns to wave falls over gets up and races on after the others with his strange hippity hop little gait
watching from a distance norma j wipes away tears oh my
wishful pats her comfortingly quietly to wishful you think well ever see him again shrugs its out of our flippers a high shot reveals the miles of frozen ice that
the graduates have to cover to get to the sea
some are shuffling along on their feet others are tobogganing
a long way behind them we see the lone figure of mumble racing to catch up
the juvenile penguins stand in a bunch peering down looking for somewhere to dive in
what do you think here
are you kidding
how about over here then
they shuffle off in a group to a nearby spot
that last place looked better
they all shuffle back to the previous spot and stand there frozen by indecision then again
suddenly the little dark figure of mumble barrels through the pack yelling outta my way flipperbirds
for a long moment hes airborne
he hits the water with a strangled squawk
what was that
they tentatively crane over the edge
no sign of him
they peer into the water
where did he go
see any blood
mumble shoots out of the water like a missile
whatcha waiting for
splosh as he falls back under water again
without hesitation ella follows him
the others follow ella
a few at first then all of them en masse leap yelling and hollering
the penguins flounder around flapping laughing and choking i had an instinct id be good at this
actually we all were
we were the best
transformed into creatures of grace and exuberance they swoop and dive trailing plumes of bubbles
over this the music of the beach boys
suntanned bodies and the waves of sunshine
those california girls and the beautiful coastline
in the warmed up weather lets get together and do it again
two penguins shoot up through holes in the ice
skidding out of control they collide ending up in a breathless heap on top of each other
they scramble to their feet
but the ice is slippery
they clutch together slipping and sliding
ive got you
no i dont
leaning against each other they manage to stand up close now eyes meeting
yes i do
a brief moment then
the only bad thing about being with ella
it was always so darned crowded
as others pop up all around ella
where da get to
there you are
laughing she dives into the water
the young males follow her
mumble hippity hops to the edge and tumbles in after her
a half dozen of them gambolling together their bubble trails intertwining
in the warmed up weather lets get together and do it again
then everyone freezes as a few silvery fish swim past
they all zero in
collisions barging a bit like water polo when the ball is first thrown in
in an instant
all the fish are taken
mumble surfaces with a fish in his beak muffled ella
you get one
not this time
muffled here have it
thank you mumble but its yours
muffled i want you to have it
why dont i have it suddenly a skua bird swoops down and grabs it
thats a felony
mumble let go
mumble hangs on
neither he not the skua will let go
the skua soars higher taking mumble with him
mumble is carried
higher and higher
the skua tries hard to shake him off but finally gives up
derisive so fly flipperbird
he lets go the fish and mumble plummets downwards landing splat
on an ice floe
mumble lies still ella and the others gather around
mumble still has the fish firmly in his beak
is he breathing
hes certainly not eating leaning forward to take the fish maybe i should just
mumble regains consciousness
the fish is for ella to ella take it
its for you ella leans forward takes the fish and daintily gulps it down
spent youre welcome
the entire sky is ablaze with the shimmering lights of the the penguins stand below looking up in wonder
they sing gotta keep those lovin good vibrations a happenin with her ahhhhhhhhhhhhh
the harmonies are exquisite until
very loud and tuneless
good good good
the singing stops
mumble knock it off
the singing resumes
gotta keep those lovin good vibrations a happenin with her
its too much for mumble
this stops the whole thing dead
ella pads over to him
gently mumble the thing is
i know its better if you just listen
she returns to the choir
the singing resumes
a perfect harmonic mumble cant help himself
he begins to tap dance
we find mumble on his own small ice floe separate from the others on their iceberg
as their singing drifts across to him mumble does an exquisite little soft shoe shuffle
as night slowly pales to a misty dawn and mumbles lonely floe drifts off turning slowly in the current music over the tracks of my tears he is woken by
a nudge at his little raft of ice
im awake now
you got me he looks around an unfamiliar landscape of ice then over the side seeing nothing but slowly spreading ripples
a more violent nudge from behind almost makes him lose his balance
a dark shape passes swiftly through the water
the dark shape shoots out of the water
its gaping jaws missing mumble by an inch
as he recoils slips and tumbles into the water
choking thrashing and gulping air mumble scrambles to get back onto the ice
glub the murderous creature comes at him jaws open baring rows of sharp teeth and mumble swims for his life
the leopard seal is relentless barging through smaller floes powering around larger ones
mumble just cant shake him off
desperate he shoots up into the air landing on a thin pancake of ice that cannot support his weight
mumble scrambles to gain purchase but falls back into the water
now he is
caught between the solid ice above him and the bottomless black water below
mumble powers ahead the ice above growing thicker the angled ceiling forcing him down deeper into the blackness
the leopard seal opens its mouth
its gaping jaws are about to engulf mumble when
a little speck of light appears in the ceiling of ice
mumble makes a speedy sharp turn climbing steeply
he is in a funnel of ice
getting narrower and narrower as it rises to the surface
the leopard seal is closing fast
mumble shoots through the hole in the ice and into the air
a small group of adelie penguins recoil as mumble explodes out of the hole closely followed by the leopard seal
they belly flop on the ice
thats gotta hurt
who ordered seal
mumble is quickly on his feet and out of the leopard seals reach
the adelies taunt the bulky creature like matadors over here no over here
have to lose some weight pesado the frustrated leopard seal snaps and snarls impotently
yeah go chase someone your own size ya big
taunting it with a cheeky little tap dance
the adelies love it
do that again
defensive i didnt do anything
that thing with the feet
to the others hola muchachos
to mumble show them
i just kind of go
and then this
bolder now he does a few neat steps
shake those hips
yo penguino bust a move
they copy him improvising little riffs on his dance step
the leopard seal inches up behind them
then mebbe something like
i got it
an adelie adds an acrobatic variation of his own
the leopard seal is almost upon them
or how about
mumble adds a neatly executed slide just as the leopard seal strikes
mumble avoids the lunge and the creatures face comes down hard on the ice to the winded seal eat my ice lardface
kiss my frozen toosh rubber butt they fall about laughing
the leopard seal returns to the water
i know where you live
yeah its called the land tubby
flop back anytime
laughing hysterically at their own jokes they strut off
mumble watches them go
hey aint you coming tallboy
or you got something better to do
mumble looks out at the endless sea of floating ice pancakes all the way to the horizon
he shrugs and hurries off after his new friends
a strange cacophony building as the four adelie amigos and mumble crest the rise to see
a vast boisterous adelie penguin community
thousands of them stretching as far as the eye can see
its very rio very samba worlds away from the sedate emperor colony
wow there are so many of you
hey this is nothin
used to be twice as many of us
yeah back when you could still catch a fish
the shortage has affected you too
who you calling shortish
all i know is a lot of us aint comin back
and some folks so hungry they eating rocks sure enough an adelie walks by a pebble in his beak
laughing eating rocks
that is major funny
thats terrible just kidding the rocks are for nest building thats how its works here
the one with the most rocks gets the chicas
chica boom chica boom chica boom boom so why arent you guys collecting them cos we got personality
without us the chicas got no boom boom
without us the fiesta will be a siesta
watch and learn tallboy
one of the adelies calls to a pair of young females he sees walking by
the adelies pose ruffling up their crests into various styles the mohawk the flat top
see something you like
trying to top each other they add hippity hops theyve just learned from mumble
the females are intrigued
whered you learn that
the big guy
he from out of town
he with us
do it again
sorry shows over
to mumble as they walk off treat em mean and keep em keen
hold back til the season when they begging for it
calls after them yeah guys in your dreams you see
some penguins got it some dont and the amigos in unison we got they punch and bump each other playfully
you think i could get some of it
hombre you got so much already you dangerous
he touches mumble and recoils as if burnt yow
you really think so
you got the biggest personality of any of us
except for me maybe
put that ego away ramon you gonna hurt someone
music over carlos santanas oye como va
so for a while i forgot about finding a song altogether
the adelies and mumble form a conga weaving in and out of the nest builders aiming a kick here and there at their industrious brethren
we were a team the adelies swoop and dive corralling a few small fish into a crevice
the fish darting to and fro are suddenly confronted by mumbles open beak
mumble shares out the catch there was so much to do so much to see mumble and the adeles come shooting down a long curving slippery dip arriba
as they shoot off the slippery dip and into the sea mumble whacks his head on the edge of the ice the adelies shoot back up to the surface
mumble sinks slightly dazed watching the kalaeidescope patters of the surface recede
music over ground control to major tom wheres the tall boy i thought he was with you
they jump back in to look for him
mumble keeps sinking down down down into a great cathedral like space lit by eerie shards of underwater light
stuff down there beyond my wildest imagining
imbedded in the base of the glacier the rusting remains of an old yellow excavator projecting out of the glacier
it hangs there inscrutable like a great yellow totem
mumble dwarfed by it contemplates it for a while then ventures inside into the body of the beast
a rusting steering column a perforated dashboard
he pecks at the metal trying to taste it listening to the sound it makes
in the shimmering space outside the bulldozer the adelies congregate
you sure he went in there
done go near it looks like it can bite one of them smims closer to the great jaws ramos
mumble pops his head out from between the jaws oh
there you are terrified the adelies scatter and shoot to the surface like missiles
i want to speak to you
the adelies are heading back to their colony as fast as their little legs will carry then
mumble hippity hops after them forget it were not going back there never but its dead
it cant hurt you maybe its got a brother still alive
but thats what we have to find out
dont you see
things like that could be eating the fish
the idea is so stunningly original it stops them in their tracks
heres the plan we go and ask the revered one
the one who knows first we gonna need stones though why stones
wait for me mumble and the adelie amigos are bunched together near the head of a long queue of adelies each with a stone or in their beak
at the head of this queue stands loveday guardian of a huge pile of pebbles
his head pokes through one of the rings a plastic six pack can holder festooned with seaweed like a
a group of soul singers mainly female sway in the background singing a soulful song of adoration as the penguin ahead of mumble steps forward
first the devotion
the penguin adds his pebble to the pile
loveday holds up a flipper for silence and a hush falls over the gospel choir a moment
composing himself and your question
senor loveday my wife is one of the disappeared ones tell me is she alive
loveday hyperventillates his eyes roll up in his head the mystic beings are speaking to me
she is alive and happy and you are in her thoughts
but is she with another male
one pebble one question
the amigos push mumble forward
he is at least a head taller than the others
you are the one with the question
how does he do it
he just one look and he know
mumble places the pebble on the pile
a long pause a little nervous
take your time
in fact mumble is mesmerised by the luight catching lovedays six pack holder
he bends forwards to study it more closely i was wondering
have you ever been abducted by aliens
no time wasters
thats not his question
hes new here
prompting mumble the yellow thing ask him whats taking the fish
ignoring them you see i met a skua once with something like that on his legs
whats he talking about
and he said he was abducted by aliens
starts to wheeze and cough listen friend this is my sacred talisman bestowed upon me by the mystic beings
looks like they bestowed it very tight
during my epic journey of enlightenment to the forbidden shore
so these mystic beings did you see them
i hear them
they talk to me all the time i am their instrument
they chose me to
did they have frontways eyes
fat flabby faces
did they probe you and stick a pointy thing into you
how many questions is that
you dont have enough pebbles
yeah one pebble one question
weve all got stuff to ask pal
but i havent had any answers yet
the mystic beings are speaking
they say show some respect stranger
especially to the one who knows
a hush falls over the gathering
the reason there are not enough fish is simple there is not enough love in the world
love is the answer
one cue the gospel choir start singing all you need is love over this okay everybody turn around to the penguin next to you and give them a great big
this is a safe place
the gathering hug awkwardly
mumble because of his towering height has trouble embracing the adelie next to him
the mating season starts today so heres what everybody should do go forth and multiply
if youll excuse i myself must retire for a moment to the couch of indulgence
okay ladies whos gonna be first
mumble and the adelies are jostled aside in the stampede of females as the gospel group break ranks and mob him me loveday
one at a time
and dont touch the talisman
i liked him better when he was just plain pedro
did he say it starts today why didnt someone tell us
we gotta get to work guys
they start posturing for the any females they can attract hola baby
get your chica boom boom here
turn round look at us
a couple of females look up from the scrum how many rocks you got
forget em honey
they only one between the six of them
and they just spent it
getting desperate wait
the adelies all start dancing madly but it is too frenetic too desperate
you like it arriba
what do you need stones for
try sitting on the ice for a month
it might come to you salsa boy
come on consuela
rejected the amigos stop dancing
their loss guys
ramon where you going
ramon is searching frantically for pebbles
gotta be some rocks left here somewhere
to mumble hey big guy got any love stones over where you come from
we dont collect them
all we have to do is well
we sing easy as that
so why arent you over there
mumble looks at them
then opens his beak and demonstrates la la la la la la la laaaaaaaaaaaaa
to each other whats he doing
its a distress call its world music get out of here
thats how i ended up with you guys
and emperor who cant sing isnt an emperor at all
youre an emperor all right youre a king among emperors
the singing we can fix
which ways this colony of yours
well all come
yeah i like em tall
you jus gotta do exacly as i say
it is autumn the emperor penguins for the mating season
it is just like the great gathering we saw at the beginning of our story
males and females sing their heartsongs
and one song stands out from all the others
where norma j
once sang stands ella now sleek and fully mature
gathered around her in a semi circle a half a dozen adoring males
voulez vous coucher avec moi ce soir
voulez vous coucher avec moi
suddenly she becomes aware of a mellifluous male voice overlapping hers
it has a curious bossa nova rhythm
tall and tanned and young and lovely the girl from ipanema goes walking and when she passes each guy she passes goes aaaah ella turns to see a penguin backlit
by the sun standing heroically on a little rise just as wishful did
ella recognizes those tapping feet
could this be mumble
she moves closer to investigate
oh and i want her so badly how can i tell her i love her
yes i would give my heart gladly
but each day when she walks to the sea she looks straight ahead not at me
tall and tanned and young and lovely
overlapping hi ella what do you think
ella suspicious moves to one side
mumble moves to block her view
she moves further tound and sees hola bonita
obviously hes been singing while mumble mimes mumble thats just cheap she turns and heads off
the adelie starts after her
you and me baby we can make sweet music
i may be short but im a love god
mumble smacks him with the back of a flipper and goes off after ella himself
he takes her by the shoulders shes upset
shakes her head tearful when you left without saying goodbye i thought something had happened then i thought he just doesnt care
i never stopped thinking about you
and then when i saw you singing for a second i thought
i cant sing
she walks off
but ill show you something better he taps an up tempo syncopated rhythm on the ice
sing something to this
her back to him whats the point
its embarrassing just try it
ella begins to hum never can say goodbye ironically and without conviction
okay thatll work
just keep it going
the singing adelie joins in
acapella very rhythmic
turn around you fool you know i love you more and more
right on cue the rest of the amigos appear on either side of him singing back up
tell me why is it so dont wanna let you go i never can say goodbye no
no no no
curious ella turns
framed between the adelies mumble strikes a pose holds it for a moment
then lets rip
he tap dances
uninhibited wild joyous
the adelies accompany him
they know all the moves and it is infectious feet are beginning to tap couples are beginning to improvise
singing along trying out the dance steps
now ella is caught up in it
and mumble is dancing like no this is it ella
this is the song inside me
ella is ecstatic
just when we think the whole colony will be swept up into the abandon
a dark figure steps forward bellows ella stops dancing
mumble misses a beat loses his footing trips and goes sliding across the ice to the feet of caruso and the elders
im just showing them happy feet happy what
this is an outrage
the adelies shuffle uncomfortably
caruso turns to the rest of the emperors
it is exactly this kind of disrespectful heretic behaviour that has brought the scarcity upon us
dont you see
we are being brought to account by the forefathers
the kid was never quite the full penguin
it all began the year he hatched
hes the one who brought the blight
you think its my fault that there are no fish
doing happy feet cant cause a food shortage
then what did
my own opinion
i think living beyond the ice there are creatures weve never met before aliens
pushing in he has abandoned the faith
he has driven the fish away
protecting mumble come on hombre loosen up the tall guy was just trying to
dont touch me
he bats the adelies aside like skittles
mumble intervenes enraged skua talk
hes talking skua talk
hes the spawn of evil
the devil penguin
this is craziness no son theyre right
wishful emerges from the crowd you too pa
truth is im the cause of it
i dropped the egg
i made you how you are
if only youd come back to us relinquish the dark side no
what have they done to you
youre talking like caruso
just do it
pray to the forefathers for forgiveness
all of you
im outa here
mumble walks away
the community part to let him go
ella chases after him
catching up with him its no use ella
i cant live with that
can you live without it
i believe in you mumble
but without the huddle we cant make an egg
without the egg what are we here for
true thats a big question guys
can me and ella be alone for a bit the adelies give them space ok
heres what im going to do
im going to talk an alien
im going to find whats causing the shortage but what about
its the only way
unless we have food theres no future for any of us you me the adelies anyone but
give me a year just until the next great gathering
if i dont make it back
at least i tried but
now go back
i love you
ella returns to the community
as she does so caruso begins to chant the gathering answers
together we stand divided we freeze
recite the wisdoms
in the wisdoms we trust
when all others leave
more fervent bretheren
when the sun vanishes
ellas watches through tears as the tiny figures of mumble and the adelies dwindle to specks and disappear into the mist
mumble and the adelies have put the colony far behind trekking homewards tell me again where were going
to find the mystic beings
how do we know where they live
well ask loveday
hes been there
most of the adelies are sitting on nests
the adeleies and mumble trek past them a protective mother takes a peck at them
not so close
we got babies on board wow
does nesting make em touchy
they find loveday at the back of what is left of his pebble pile
he sits leaning against it
loveday you okay
what happened too much boom boom for one penguin
mumble kicks a bunch of pebbles at him
just one question
and i want a straight answer
where do i find the mystic beings
loveday tries to raise himself up
a tight low gurgling rumbles from his throat
why dont he speak
loveday gurgles and points wildly to the six pack plastic round his neck
sounds like talisman
his eyes bulge
its a seizure
the talismans gotten way too tight
why din you say so
hold on we gonna take it off
you pull that side i pull this side
they tug at the six pack plastic
loveday gasps and winces
youre hurting him
the adelies back off
loveday gives a little so so gesture with his flipper
it not gonna come off
of course its not
loveday where did you get it
it was bestowed on him
by the mystic beings
loveday shakes his head sadly
they didnt bestow it on you
he dont know what hes saying
if it wasnt bestowed what happened
loveday mimes swimming
oh this ones easy
on his hectic journey of delightenment
to the forbidding shore
loveday mimes the talisman going over his head
well to me thats gotta be bestowing
loveday shakes his head no
he stretches his neck
you looked up and
it just got caught around your neck
hes the revered one he speaking symbolically
loveday hangs his head
a tear slides down his beak
gently loveday did you ever meet a mystic being
beaten loveday shakes his head no the adelies are stunned into silence
but this thing was made by someone
and if we find them they could take it off
loveday looks up a glimmer of hope in his eye
so where do we go loveday loveday then he makes a strange oi oi oi sound
now he thinks hes an elephant seal loveday nods and points towards the mountains
he wants to go to the top of the mountain
loveday shakes his head
the forbidden place is over the mountains
in the land of the elephant seals
loveday gestures wildly with his flippers
beyond the land of the elephant seals
loveday nods yes
and falls back in exhaustion
so whos coming oi the adelies labour uphill into the wind
loveday is lagging behind breathing hard
even mumble and the amigos are puffing with the effort of the climb
music over he aint heavy hes my brother
we mustve gone past it past
dont kid me
were not even close
then on the wind comes a fiant oi oi oi
as they crest the peak sure enough down below the land of the elephant seals
thousands of them
refresh my memory do elephant seals eat penguin
jus krill and fish
sure of your facts are you
not waiting mumble launches himself over the other side slip sliding down the mountain
one by one the adelies follow
well i guess were about to find out the beach is literally heaving
mumble and the adelies come tumbling and sliding right up to two huge seals
big bellied booming southern voice well roll me over and call me a dugong
what the heck have we got here the adelies bunch up behind mumble excuse me we need directions
to the forbidden shore
just git yourselves over them there hills id come with you myself but
you aint told em half of it over them hills beyond the great glacier n through the blizzard country
the good ole boys are into one upmanship
its its forbidden to go there
i heard its forbidden to ask how to get there
were looking for the mystic beings mystic who
aliens the ones who made this
he indicates the six pack plastic around lovedays neck
seal lowers its massive head down to face loveday
wheezing he examines the plastic with first with one eye then the other before announcing his verdict
cut you up soon as look at you
cut you up before they look at you
could they be taking our fish
i heard theyd take a whole penguin rip its skin right off and turn it into mush
thats a picnic
i hear tell theyd take a baby seal and club it to death
with their bare clubs
clubbings a clambake
my granpappy says they been known to skin a seal from snout to tail in a hot second
your granpappy dont know squat
what i hear they take your sorry carcass melt you down burn you up take your fur n fat and turn you into a wide variety of useful items
the hell with useful those crittersd y turn you into a food item
little popsicle things
ya hear me
one day youre a big ole whale and the next minute funfood
but if your grandpappys saw them and they survived maybe theyre not so fierce
you calling me a liar son
hes calling your grandpappy a liar
and you know what maybe hes right
flop over here and say that
they start fighting lunging and flopping on each other
come on loveday lets go running to catch up go where
didnt you hear what he said its forbidden they dont know
theyve never been there stop
im hearing voices
the mystical guys
they say your life is perfectly good as it is
forget this stupid mission
mumble and loveday keep trekking
that was embarrassing man
and reluctantly he trails after them
oh no don do this to us
im a lover not a fighter the first sign of popsicles or funfood of any kind i turn round and go back mumble loveday and the adelies are tiny specks
struggling over a series of great ridges
so we walked
and kept walking
over the hills and into blizzard country a snow storm breakes over them
a screaming wind brings total white out
the penguins have to shout to make themselves heard
this is no place for a penguin
we should be migrating out to sea by now
we need to huddle
form a moving circle
share the cold share the warmth
he turns his back to the wind
immediately the adelies form a straight line down wind from him
oh yeah nice
thats definitely better
good call big guy
i said a circle
they form a little huddle but as soon as mumble moves from the upwind position the adelies complain
this cant be right
it was better the other way
they scurry back into a straight line behind mumble who cops the full blast of the gale
he gives up and marches off into the driving snow
what happened to the huddle
shouts back just keep moving
toboggan if you have to
the others lie down propelling themselves forwards on their fronts oh no now i got chest pain tell you this is a good way to get snow blind
just keep moving or youll get my beak up your butt the blizzard has passed
an eerie stillness
one by one the adelies get to their feet and waddle forwards to where mumble and loveday stand gazing into the distance
they have finally reached the sea again you think this is it
the forbidden shore
loveday chokes out a yes
the way i feel the frostbitten shore so what are those black things
close to the waters edge the outline of several buildings the penguins venture through it dwarfed by the old flensing sheds the chimneys and boiling vats
its all now abandoned and half concealed by snow
around and above them there are hooks chains rusting twisted metalwork
is there anyone out there
an ominous groaning as some rusting metal plate moves in the wind
no need to shout
yeah somebody might hear you
i think we seen all there is to see round here
loveday is looking at something at his feet
what is it
there imbedded in the ice another six pack holder
mumble and the adelies venture out onto the weak ice beyond the whaling station finding more and more of the strange artefacts a piece of nylon rope a soda can
they must be here somewhere
they wouldnt leave all this stuff lying around
maybe they invisible
theyve reached the edge of the sea ice
loveday croaks a warning
he points out to sea
what is that
a wave has appeared on the glassy surface of the sea
it is coming towards them fast like the bow wave of an immense a whale
as long as its a good whale not the other kind
the wave is coming closer
what other kind
a massive black dorsal fin breaks the surface
the ones with teeth
the penguins are off and running
the dorsal fin keeps coming like the blade of a demonic carving knife
then the monstrous fin disappears and kaboom
the killer whale breaches the ice ahead of them cutting off their retreat
they are left stranded on a free floating ice floe jump
swim for it
stay on the ice pad where its safe the little floe is wobbling crazily you call this safe amigo
maybe we should split up
you split up im staying right here
the killer whale breaches again rising like a tower block out of the ocean
the ice pad flips flinging them into the water like a handful of peanuts
the penguins head for shore swimming for their lives
loveday thrashing and wheezing is unable to keep up
stops he swims back
the killer whale is about to take them both in one bite
mumble pulls loveday aside but hes not quite quick enough one of the whales outer teeth catches loveday by the six pack plastic and he is dragged away tethered to
the killer whale like captain ahab
the whale thrashes around wildly trying to dislodge the hapless little penguin until
loveday is flung high high into the air and
splashes down some distance away
the killer whale is left with the six pack plastic lodged in its teeth
mumble and loveday scramble onto the ice exhausted
wondering where the next attack will come from the amigos huddle nearby
suddenly the ice shelf cracks open and the killer whale soars right over the top of them it hits the water but does not stop just keeps going right on
out to sea
the penguins have no time to reflect on their good fortune
theres an earth shattering noise behind them
turning they see a vast black shape a hundred feet high coming at them through the fog
the adelies flee across the ice
mumble stands transfixed by the big black ship towering above him
on the deck he sees aliens
the pack ice is buckling and exploding ahead of the great stop
from a safe distance the adelies stop and look on in amazement as mumble stands his ground shouting up at the ship as it advances towards him
its very important
the ice beneath his feet opens up mumble topples into the gap and the ship passes over him huge propellers churning leaving a channel ninety feet wide
he chases after the ship
the adelies chase after mumble
already the ship is half a mile away
beyond the last of the ice floes is the worlds tallest iceberg
mumble hurls himself onto it and starts scrambling up its precipitous sides
the adelies follow struggling to keep up
mumbles pov the big black ship has joined two others about a mile away
the adelies join him
you found them you found aliens
now we go back tell everybody whos taking the fish
mumbles eyes remain fixed on the horizon
dont feel bad tall guy
they were just too fast
i owe you my life amigo
and i say this because i admire and deeply respect you
if you are thinking what i think you are thinking
you are out of your crazy head say hi to ella for me
you say hi
come back and say hi to her yourself mumble turns takes a few paces back
one other thing
you guys what
suddenly mumble turns to the precipice and runs as fast as he can
as he launches himself into space
the tiny penguin soaring off the top of the iceberg
the adelies rush to the edge as far below mumble hits the water
can you believe that brought us all this way and killed himself no he didnt
far out he has surfaced and is swimming strongly in direction of the big black ship
a dive like that and still he lives
yeah like when he did his happy feet his feet had wings
a normal penguin could never have done it
you dont think we should go with him dont sweat it revered one
many are called few are chosen
hey how tall you think the tall guy was
who could say
four times my height at least
loveday follows behind about this revered one stuff you guys yeah maybe just call me pedro mumble ploughs through a rolling sea towering waves block everything from view but on
the crests he catches sight of
three black ships far ahead but stationary as if waiting for him
hes getting closer
the ships are only half a mile away when something rises from the deep threatening to engulf him a mumble shoots out of the way just avoiding being caught as
up ahead the great net full of fish breaks the surface of the water and is winched on board
yells as if in response the ships engines start up again and the sea around him erupts in churning foam
swamped by the wake mumble goes under
when he resurfaces the ship is already on its way
he takes a deep breath and resumes his pursuit
the seas are mountainous
there is no sign of the ship now nor of land
mumble swims up the side of each wave over its foaming crest and down into the deep dark valley below
the air is full of spray
choking mumble ducks under the water
its peaceful here
then something moves beside him and turns with a start to see a massive eye
a blue whale entirely fills his field of vision
it sings a few booming wagnerian notes
its voice is almost deafening
he surfaces spluttering
a voice calls to him from above
mumble looks up
an albatross hovers overhead
hes looking for a mate mate
and these days i tell you theyre few and far between from the albatross aerial view mumble looks tiny next to the massive bulk of the blue whale
talking of which i never seen a penguin this far out
watch you dont hit the convergence mate
where the cold water meets the warm mate
once you cross it theres no getting back
what you tryinmg to prove anyway
im trying to talk to the aliens
on the black iceberg
the ones taking all the fish
fish is just the start of it mate
them aliens is the ones who took out the whales
they kill whales
thats impossible straight up mate
biggest creatures ever lived
so if i wanted to talk to them where would i go anywhere and everywhere
over the sea under the sea jees ive even seen them fly
the great southlands swarming with em wheres that
do you think the whale would take me there
the blue whale responds with a long mournful no o o o which the albatross does not need to translate
no way mate he wont go anywhere near em
and neither should you
mumble hesitates bobbing on the water weighing the warnings
he makes up his mind and strikes out again swimming towards the convergence
the albatross hovering on the wing watches
dont say i didnt warn you the albatross wheels away
as mumble fights on through the huge choppy waves the whales wagnerian song booms out eerie and forlorn
we see from above the blue whale turning as well changing course to avoid a change in the texture and colour of the water stretching in a line as far
as the eye can see
mumble swims right across the line
mumble is a mere dot now as the great currents capture him and sweep him away
we pull back through the clouds until the very curvature of the earth is visible a blue horizon with no land in sight
on the high water mark amongst the rubbish and the oil slick we see what looks like a dead animal
it is mumble
a creature in red gumboots approaches
its small hand reaches down and nudges him with a stick
mumble moans and the gumboots run away shouting something unintelligible
with great difficulty mumble raises his head to try to see more
sunlight flares bleaching to white as he loses
scientific books and specimens of birds in large bottles on shelves line the walls
mumble eyes closed is lying on a stainless steel table
he opens his eyes to the brilliant glare of an examination lamp
there is movement around him
voices whispering in an alien tongue
a figure in white bends over him cleaning the oil from his feathers with detergent
when i finally saw one the alien was even more hideous than id imagined a very pretty female scientist is smiling down at him
frontways eyes no feathers
big teeth with blood around them
strange fleshy beak
a meat eater terrified the fish are ours
but all the scientist sees is a squawking penguin
we cant live without them
the scientist produces a syringe and squirts some of its contents in the air
another scientist holds him still while the needle is administered
not the pointy thing
drowsy now he is eased into a padded cage
the scientists close the lid and secure it with straps
we hear a feeble thumping from inside
pull back to reveal mumbles box on a shelf among crates and luggage
fade in engine noise over as
a drones across the screen eastwards into the night
i woke in darkness
unable to move
was i dead
and if i was dead where was that light coming from like the light at the end of a tunnel
as if in a dream mumble ambles towards it
emerging into bright blue sky sparkling white cliffs of ice
they brought me home his voice echoes back at him with a mocking edge
there is something unusual about this place
a plump penguin waddles by excuse me where are we
where dyou think
so were dead
we got food
we got water
you hear a seal now and then but you never meet one
mumble is looking around trying to figure it out fish
a fish hits him on the head
a moment later hes knocked flat by a sudden rush of penguins chinstraps rock hoppers adelies king penguins emerging from holes in the rock face fish time
lying on his back he sees fish tumble from the sky
its every day after that it rained fish in the afternoon
his pov load after load of fish tumbling out of a clear sky fish hit the surface and sink fish on land and fish underwater
mumble pursues one of them
sometime you got a live one but there was nowhere really to chase it he swims slap bang into a sheet of thick glass
alien faces are pressed against it
mumble yells and shoots to the surface
high up he sees the viewing gallery
a great crowd of aliens staring and chattering aliens everywhere watching you eat watching you sleep mumble backs away and knocks into the painted horizon
he puts out a wing to steady himself and notices a metal tag on it
this place is beginning to upset him
yells at the aliens what have you done to my wing
this is not my home
i want to get out of here
the other penguins stand around immobile chomping fish
guess hes new here caption a year later specators pov mumble stands around like the others ignoring the aliens chomping fish his pov day after day the view constantly the
same except for the groupings of spectators high in the viewing gallery after a while you learn to stop fighting it
stop protesting take the knocks
cu mumble a camera flashes
a fish hits him he doesnt flinch just take what comes and live inside your mind another day and another
night follows day follows night
spectators come and go
the penguins stand like statues
though bubbles begin to appear above mumbles head snapshots of his past experiences sometimes i thought about dad and mum
sometimes the amigos and others id met along the way
but mostly i thought about ella wondering who she ended up with
whether she had enough food to eat
whether she still remembered our song
in the though bubble ella has appeared singing never can say goodbye
mumbles feet begin shuffling to the rythm
most of the specators are leaving but one young girls stops and stares look mommy
she bangs on the glass in her excitement
mumble woken from his reverie looks up and sees her looking at him
what did i do
the little girl who is pointing at mumbles feet
mumble looks down realizes what his feet are doing looks up again
you like that
well how about this
he does a more elaborate step
the mother shouts in disbelief
various other specators come back and join her
mumbles fellow captives are unimpressed
oh oh another one gone troppo you think its infectious i sure hope not they shuffle away the aliens in contrast are loving it
already a crowd has gathered laughing and clapping
the gallery is packed
mumble keeps dancing
theres a riot going on up there
people fighting to get a view
newspaper reporters tv cameras
the other penguins in the enclosure have moved back giving mumble more space
every specattor is focussed on him
mumble is focussed on the spectators
at last something was happening
i was finally getting through to them
a squawking mumble is thrust inside and the lid slams shut on him
silence then across the vast expanse a tiny figure appears on the horizon
coming from the inland
a couple of penguins watch the approaching figure
is it a penguin
is it one of ours
mumble approaches the two sentries
the colony is much diminished only small groups scattered here and there
hi where is everybody
who wants to know
i used to live here
whens the great gathering
this is it
i guess this is all thats left
other penguins are gathering to scrutinise the stranger
so whos this
kinda small for an emperor
suspicious where did you say you were from
then a female penguin bursts out of the crowd
is it you
you havent changed a bit
as he speaks his eyes are drawn to the huge number of fluffy chicks following behind her are these all yours
theyre my singing students
of course not
i was waiting for you
but thats fantastic
ive got so much to tell you to tell everyone
to the gathering crowd i found out whos been causing the scarcity
i know whos been taking our fish
i made contact with aliens
theyre coming here
right behind me
above the wind faint electronic beeping sound
whos doing all the shouting its mumble
hes worse than before
no honestly aliens will be here soon
you have to believe me
we came in a big hollow bird and they landed on the ice and
caruso bursts through the crowd
and still full of the same old nonsense
but its true
the beep is quite audible now a little faster and louder
curious ella ambles round behind mumble tro see whats making the noise move along everyone
pay no attention
theres no such thing as aliens so who fixed him up with this
she turns him around to reveal some kind of circuit board glued to his back a small aerial winking red lights
a a gasp of fear and astonishment from the penguins
caruso is momentarily speechless
does it hurt
its not made of feathers thats for sure whats it gonna do
its so they can find me
cocks an ear thats them now
a distant rumbling like some monstrous cataclysm is approaching you led them here
are you crazy
you said they didnt exist
theyll slaughter us
head for the sea
do happy feet
he starts tap dancing
the penguins are torn between carusos instructions and mumbles
its what they understand
they cant talk they cant sing
they speak with their feet
a few adventurous souls begin to copy him out of fear if nothing else
as they do so the sky begins to darken
a strange whirling wind starts whipping the snow around them
the very earth seems to be shaking under them
now look what youve done
its the end of the world
its all mumbles fault
i told you wishful rounds on them angrily
just do what the kid says
they start dancing
caruso has climbed a small hillock and is ranting like an old testament prophet recite the wisdoms
together we stand
divided we freeze
mumble and ella are dancing through the community come on everyone
its our only chance
when all others leave we remain the tide is beginning to turn in his favour thats it
riba riba penguinos
shake those hips
come on bust a move
adhere to the wisdoms
the ancients will protect us as he shouts his he is blown off his feet by a tremendous gust of wind caruso tumbles head over heels as a massive chinook
helicopter rises over the hirizon its massive rotors mashing the air
it swoops down over the penguin nation and lands a little distance away
music over wanna dance with somebody
now the entire emperor community are dancing for all they are worth
i never doubted it for a moment mrs astrakhan dances past more feelink
wishful dances over to her his eyes on mumble and ella dancing you know who that is
thats my boy
dancing know him
he ees my star pupol
human scientists disembark
skidoos are kicked into life
we travel with the skidoos across the ice shelf to the colony scientists pov as they stop lower their hoods and gaze in astonishment
one of them lifts a video cam to record from that day on no one quite knows how it happened but the black icebergs began to disappear and the fish
became abundant once more
suited figures are seated round a large table watching as images of the dancing penguin colony play on a video screen
without the music its less obviously a dance
so what do you reckon
yes quite extraordinary
stares at the screen some kind of neurological disorder
a nutritional deficiency perhaps
wed certainly back the long term study
and the international treaty
this is exactly the leverage we need for an embargo
no fishing whatsoever
legal illegal sanctioned whatever
so we all step up policing of the pirate factory ships
and we pressure that country to stop their so called experimental fishing
yes if our government asks your government to approach their government to call off their fleet
better if their government hear it from our government via your government
what the heck
the amount of publicity this is generating theyd have world war three if they didnt stop
in the confusion of penguins we find mumble ella and their chick ellas gave up teaching to look after our chick
we take turns looking after her and going to get the fish
as we watch ella moves off joining the great to and fro of penguins along the highway to the sea
mumble covers his chick protectively watrching his wife walk away
i worry about her sure
theres so much big stuff out there it can be kind of frightening
we are pulling back now back from the colony back from antarctica
but the way i see it
theres so much out there we dont understand
still pulling back the stuff you think is small stuff could actually be the big stuff
keep pulling back from the world the solar system the galaxy
or am i not making sense here
our galaxy is framed in something like a bomb sight
is there a problem
i thought this one was barren
we re somewhere otherworldly inside a clear dome the size of a stadium with a view of the heavens
in the centre of this space always just out of shot two illdefined figures are talking subtitled more or less
but one of the stars were harvesting supports these things here
projected somehow in mid air a d image of times square in winter with tiny people milling around in black coats
but what we didnt know about before was these things here an image of the dancing penguins appears
just thought youd want to see them before
the shadowy figure laughs enjoying the image
we go ahead
better leave them be
