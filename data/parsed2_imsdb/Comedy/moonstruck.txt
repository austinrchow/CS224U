by john patrick shanley final draft several dozen loaves of golden italian bread are standing on end in a shaft of morning sunlight
they are standing on end in bins
in the window zitos can be read in reverse
we leave the loaves and drift down to a progresso products calendar which hangs from the wall by a nail
the month is november
various phone numbers and delivery dates have been penned in in a rough scrawl
now we go to a white formica counter scuffed and pocked from long use
on the counter in a rinsed out olive jar filled with water are three fat red roses
the title appears in black script against the now we faintly hear the voice of zito himself and a low barely discernable three times they cancel the order with me
and three times they come back
who they kidding
they cheap cheap cheap
the other bread they get is no good
they save pennies
everybody complain and they come back
zito your bread is the best
theyre like children stupid in school who cannot learn
its the water
you buy bread in hoboken you get hoboken water
hoboken water is dry
ask anybody who knows
ask your father
during zitos plaintive words we leave the roses and move down the counter to a calculator being tapped very efficiently with the eraser end of pencil
when the results appear the pencil notes the figure in a threadbare old ledger
hes a middle aged italian man with a kind face
but its early in the day and hes already been working for hours so hes a little tired and disgruntled
you want me to make you some coffee
shes entering a few final figures in the ledger
loretta is italian
her hair black done in a dated style is flecked with grey
shes dressed in sensible but unfashionable clothes of a dark color
what dyou know about coffee
gimme a loaf of bread
loretta emerges with her little weathered leather bookkeeping satchel and a loaf of zito bread in a white paper bag
she moves off briskly
this is a little italian funeral parlor
a generic little room filled with many flowers and wreathes many folding chairs a few old people sitting and up front the star of the show the corpse on display
in his gold and formica casket
before the casket is a little kneeler
we discover an old lady there who crosses herself and rises
she goes and sits by ruby another old women
she leans over and says
he looks great
that al conti is a genius
first we see a name plate on a desk
the plate reads alfonso conti
we hear his voice
i am a genius
the shot widens to include the loaf of bread which is half cut up and being buttered
next to the bread are two steaming mugs of coffee
we hear the subdued tapping of lorettas tabulations
if youre such an artistic genius why cant you keep track of your receipts
how am i going to do your income tax
i am an artistic genius
the shot widens and now we can see al conti and loretta sitting at the desk having zitos buttered bread and mugs of coffee
lorettas got her calculator going and is entering figures in als black gold lettered ledger
if youre an artistic genius how come you got butter on your tie
he looks down and sees the stain
hes at a loss
give it here
ill give you this al you make good coffee
she downs her coffee accepts the stained tie which al has taken off and slams the ledger shut
we are looking at a wall of dry cleaned clothes bags
they are hanging from an automated grid
as we watch the wall starts to move off to the left
a gap appears where no clothes are hung
the gap creates visual frame
in the frame is robert
he is operating the grid with a little stick shift
he stops it and takes down a garment
he leaves the frame heading off to the counter
when he moves away we see that loretta is behind him working her calculator entering in a ledger
she slams the ledger shut waves goodbye and goes
after beat she reappears produces contis tie says something to robert who is out of view leaves the tie and we see a cleaver whacking an oxtail into section
now we see loretta a few feet away tabulating on a chopping block that is partially obscured by a row of hanging rabbits unskinned
a long white box is being filled with red roses
we hear the red roses
the man who sends these knows what hes doing
now we see loretta tabulating and the florist working on the box of roses
the man who sends those spends a lot of money on something that ends up in the garbage can
the florist gives her a look and then smiles
im glad everybody aint like you loretta
id be outta business
without me youd be out of business
i like flowers
she gives him a sudden brief blinding smile
its the first time weve seen her smile
she has gold work around one of her two front teeth
the florist grunts and hands her a red rose
camera moves close to loretta and the rose
a red neon sign hangs in the window
its a quaint downstairs restaurant in greenwich village
a young couple stop look at the menu become more interested in each other kiss and decide to go in
white tablecloths and dark green walls a tiny bar up by the door
the waiters all look a little alike
thats because theyre all related
the place is about half full and bustles along pleasantly
a violin plays a melancholy neapolitan air
johnny and loretta sit at a table for two talking quietly
they have their menus and glasses of red wine
johnny is italian around
his wavy salt and pepper hair is impeccably combed back but there is so much that it threatens to fall forward someday and engulf his face
he is wearing a pinky ring a dark suit a gold watch and on his face a mustache and a look of incredible seriousness
loretta is italian
her black hair done in a dated style is flecked with grey
she is wearing a dark blouse black skirt and high heels
one of her teeth is framed with gold work
johnny is really timid of life an overgrown boy who hides these qualities behind a veil of dignity
loretta is tough and efficient loyal and watchful she watches out for mr
johnny and defends him against life
bobo an old world italian waiter comes over to take their order
are you ready
how are you tonight
very good mr
we will both have the salad ticino
uh huh and ill have the special fish
you dont want the fish
its the oily fish tonight
not before the plane ride
maybe youre right
give him the manicotta bobo
yes miss loretta
johnny that will give you a base
for your stomach
you eat that oily fish you go up in the air halfway to sicily youll be green and your hands will be sweating
smiles you look after me
they hear a distinguished mans voice rise out of the babble
they turn and look
the mans name is perry
perry is a university professor
patricia is his girlfriend student
hes in his s
shes about years younger
shes getting her coat on in a huff
patricia please dont go
what do you think i am a talking dog
i was just making a point about the way you said
the way you stated your aspirations
you can kiss my aspirations
she storms out leaving perry muttering to himself
kiss my aspirations
oh very clever
the height of cleverness
an abnormally shy waiter stops
could you do away with her dinner and any evidence of her and bring me an big glass of vodka
the shy waiter begins to efficiently clear
johnny is amused
bobo serves them their salad
a man who cant control his woman is funny
she was too young for him
johnny considers this a point well taken
which can be seen through a serving window
they can look out over the restaurant tables
bobo is melancholy and philosophical
eddie is a young waiter
whatsamatter uncle bobo
johnnys gonna propose marriage
how you know that
he arranged it with me
when he asks her then hell wave to me and ill bring champagne
good bachelor customer for twenty years
but who knows
maybe hell lose courage
heavy duty stuff
he holds out his empty glass
can i get another one of these
perry takes his arm
may i presume to ask you a question
do you have a girlfriend
i am alone in the world
perry lets go of his arm
he and the shy waiter commiserate a moment
then wordlessly the shy waiter goes
thats very sad
bobo is clearing the remains of mr
hes already cleared lorettas
well take the check
no i want to see the dessert cart
loretta is surprised
you never have dessert
never is a long time
johnny is uneasy
he massages his head
whats the matter
my scalp is not getting enough blood sometimes
loretta looks at him strangely
bobo rolls up the dessert cart
we see loretta and mr
johnny through the frame of the dessert cart
they turn and look at the desserts
will you marry me
will you marry me
bobo take the cart away
continuing are you proposing marriage to me
you know i was married and that my husband died
but what you dont know is i think he and i had bad luck
what do you mean
we got married at the city hall and i think it gave bad luck the whole marriage
i dont understand
right from the start we didnt do it right
could you kneel down
on the floor
yes on the floor
this is a good suit
i helped you buy it
it came with two pairs of pants
its for luck johnny
when you propose marriage to a woman you should kneel down
johnny slowly gets out of his chair
theres not enough room for him to kneel down
he has to ask two off duty pro wrestlers who are eating dinner to move their chairs
they do so with bemused expressions
their names are bob and mook
is that man praying
will you ma
interrupting wheres the ring
at a loss the ring
they are deadpan mugs
johnny a ring
i woulda sprung for a ring if it was me
shes got him on his knees
hes ruining his suit
you could use your pinky ring
i like this ring
you propose to a woman you should offer her a ring of engagement
johnny takes off the ring and holds it out to her
loretta castorini clark
on my knees
in front of all these people
will you marry me
she meekly accepts the ring from him and takes his hands
yes john anthony cammareri
i will marry you
i will be your wife
johnny slowly stands up brushes off his knees
the restaurant has fallen utterly silent
loretta kisses him quickly
bobo stands very near her table
she is about to applaud the proposal
she brings her hands together
bobos hand flashes out and neatly captures her hands before they can part again
the single sound dies abruptly in the silent room
johnny is in control now
he looks around once regally
i feel like i have just witnessed a car accident
the shy waiter sits down at perrys table
when i was twenty seven years old in jersey city i asked a woman to marry me
she had red hair
she smelled a jasmine
she wore black shoes with pointy white tips
she didnt hear me
she asked me to repeat so she could understand what i said
but i wouldnt repeat it
so im a bachelor
hes helping her on with her coat
what time is it
so well pick up the car well make the plane in plenty of time
johnny puts on his coat
my mother will be happy im getting married
bobo approaches with the bucket of champagne
i forgot to bring the champagne mr
i forgot to wave
well have it at the wedding
loretta driving and mr
johnny sitting beside her
in the back seat are two suitcases
what about the wedding

a voice can be heard over the p
system international flight number six ohfour boarding for rome and palermo at gate twenty six

he clumsily kisses her
then he quickly turns and leaves
she waves but he doesnt look back
close shot on planes wheels and under belly as it slowly begins to move
red lights are flashing
in the background we see the accordion like ramp that was loading to the departing aircraft slowly fold up
loretta walks up beside her and looks out the window too
the crone is dressed in black and has a black scarf on her head
the crone notices loretta
do you have someone on that plane
smiles my fiance
i have put a curse on that plane
my sister is on that plane
i have put a curse on that plane that it should explode
burn on fire and fall into the sea
fifty years ago she stole a man from me
today she told me that she didnt even love him
she took him to feel strong with me
now she goes back to sicily
i have cursed her that the green atlantic water should swallow her up
i dont believe in curses
smiles neither do i
the plane takes off
loretta looks after it anxiously
all her hopes are on that plane
the ltd pulls into the entrance and loretta gets out
an attendant appears
the keys in it
loretta walks of into the night
camera frames the window with a sweetheart in neon
loretta walks up the street and enters the store
loretta walks in
irv and lotte the middle aged couple who own and run the place are having an argument
ive seen how you look at her and it isnt right
how do i look at her
to loretta can i help you
a split of moet
to irv like a wolf

you never seen a wolf in your life
to loretta thats seven fifty seven
loretta pays and waits for her change
i seen a wolf in everybody i ever met and i see a wolf in you
giving the change that makes ten
have a nice night
loretta walks out
you know what i see in you lotte
the girl i married
lotte caught off guard blushes
its a big old eccentric three story corner house
to one side its got a qated arch that leads to an inner courtyard where three cars could park
its got two cast iron balconies
about a third of the windows in the house are lit
from within can be heard the faint strains of vicki carr singing and one dog barking
loretta appears carrying champagne approaches the front door unlocks it and goes in
vicki carr is singing it must be him
the front hall is typical of big old brownstones
theres a big old oak coat rack with a built in mirror and an umbrella stand
there are several coats hanging from it
the floor is littered with boots
theres also a side table
on the table is a large cut glass bowl filled with a couple of pounds of hard candy
loretta comes in and takes off her coat
a single mad howl is heard followed by a pandemonium of barking
five dogs charge into the hall to greet loretta
they are totally cockeyed crackpot mutts
their names are judas lucy leo hello boys and girls
guess what happened to me
the voice of the old man is heard calling out from upstairs
how long must i wait
quanto tempo devo aspettare
the five dogs turn away from loretta and charge up the stairs toward the voice
loretta walks toward the living room
this is the source of the vicki carr song which is just ending
cosmo castorini lorettas father is just turning off the old stereo
he is a powerful man about with a huge shock of white hair and gold wire glasses
hes wearing a big old red silk robe over blue pajamas and royal blue slippers
the room it filled with lumpy upholstered furniture once grand now threadbare shawls and doilies cover holes in failing fabric
theres a fireplace containing a dying fire
cosmos wing chair with his newspaper on it is beside a lit fringed lamp
cosmo sees loretta as she comes in
he sits in his chair and puts his feet up on an old needlepoint ottoman
he starts to read the paper
youre not sleepy
i cant sleep anymore
its too much like death
pop i got news
cosmo puts down the paper and takes his feet off the ottoman
lets go in the kitchen
cosmo gets up and heads for the kitchen
he hums and continues as loretta opens champagne
loretta and cosmo sit at the kitchen table
its a big tin table with a black and white design
loretta has put two old fashioned champagne glasses on the table the split of champagne a bag of sugar cubes and a bottle of bitters
she pours the champagne drops a little lump of sugar into each glass and adds a dash of bitters
she hands one of the drinks to cosmo
she toasts ti amo
translated i love you
you look tired
whats your news
im getting married
you did this once it didnt work out
the guy died
what killed him
he got hit by a bus
your ma and i been married fifty two years an nobody died
you were married what two years and somebody is dead

it dont work out for you
whos the man
hes a big baby
why isnt he here with you telling me

his mothers dying
more bad luck
i dont like his face loretta
i dont like his lips
when he smiles i cant see his teeth
when will you do it
in a month
i wont come
youve got to come
youve got to give me away
i didnt give you away the first time
and maybe thats why i had the bad luck
maybe if you gave me away and i got married in a church in a wedding dress instead of at the city hall with strangers standing outside the door maybe
then i wouldnt had the bad luck i had
i didnt have no wedding cake no reception or nothing
johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at the grand ticino
that dont sound like johnny
wheres the ring
loretta shows it
cosmo examines it
it looks stupid
its a pinky ring
its a mans ring
everything is temporary
that dont excuse nothing
so youll come to the wedding right
lets go tell your mother
they rise from the table
the door to the hall opens and the light from without dimly illuminates a massive four poster bed
cosmo enters followed by loretta
he speaks into the dark a calm and measured summons
a lamp is switched on by the bed
rose is in her s and is very very beautiful
her abundant white tresses frame a face of porcelain delicacy
shes wearing an old and richly beautiful white nightgown
loretta is getting married
cosmo goes and sits on the bed
i dont like him
youre not gonna marry him cosmo
do you love him loretta
when you love them they drive you crazy cause they know they can
but you like him
hes a sweet man
i wanna have a big church wedding ma
and a reception
and whos gonna pay for that
rose starts laughing
father of the bride pays
cosmo walks out
i have no money
youre rich as roosevelt
youre just cheap cosmo
cosmo shouts from the stairs
i wont pay for nothing
he didnt used to be cheap
he thinks if he holds on to his money he will never die
its his duty as a father to pay for my wedding ma
vicki carr singing it must be him starts playing
rose looks weary
now hes gonna play that damn vicki carr record
and then when he comes to bed he wont touch me
the first golden rays of sunlight touch the great old house
the front door opens
close shot of dogs coming into camera as door opens
the old man comes out
the old man who is cosmos father is years old
he is taking the five dogs out for their morning walk
he has their five leashes bundled in one hand
in the other hand even though it is a cloudless november morning he open black umbrella
he walks off down the block with the dogs
the old man and the five dogs appear and enter the park
he approaches a park bench where felix and lucy are already sitting
felix and lucy are about the same age as the old man
they each have a well behaved dog
when the old man sits down he lets the five dogs go
the dogs run off barking like mad
its wrong to just let them go
ignoring felix good morning lucy
they run around they mess up the whole park
what do you want me to do
pick up after five dogs
im eighty three years old
god in his heaven understands that i cannot pick up after five dogs
you have too many dogs
the dogs can be heard in the distance
it sounds like theyre killing each other
goes back to ignoring felix lucy
there are big things going on in my house
my granddaughter loretta the only daughter of my son cosmo has engaged herself to be married a second time
i have heard that johnny cammareri got down on his knees in the grand ticino and proposed to her
my son does not like this johnny cammareri
he says he is a big baby
you should have one dog
i wish i hadda gun
if i hadda gun i would shoot four of your dogs
the old man makes a low threatening noise
my granddaughter wants my son to pay for the wedding
but he does not want to pay
he should pay
i dont know
he owes her a wedding from the first time when there was none
i dont know
he has not asked my advice
if he asks my advice i dont know what i will say
the sound of the dogs becomes intense again
i wont have to shoot those dogs
they will kill each other
you think so huh stupid
those dogs love each other
the gates in the big archway are opened from the inside
hes wearing a good but old fashioned suit an overcoat and a homburg
hes pulled his car a black buick up to the gate
now that he has the gates open he gets in the car and drives out to the curb
he gets out and goes back to lock the gates
as he does this the old man approaches the house with the five dogs and the open umbrella
the old man and the dogs go to the front door of the house
cosmo goes to the door of his car
the two men father and son see each other at the moment they grab their respective door handles
they each raise a hand in greeting it is the same gesture for both men an eccentric chopping motion
then they open their respective doors
the old man disappears within the house
cosmo drives slowly away in his car
receives a big lump of butter with a hissing gasp of satisfaction
a wooden spoon pushes the sinking lump around until the pan is coated
two square slices of yellow bread with round holes punched in their middles land in the pan
two circles of green pepper land next to the bread
a spatula flips over the bread which has become glistening gold on the cooked side
two eggs are broken and dropped sunnyside into the holes in the bread
the circles of green pepper are pushed around by the spatula scooped up deftly and each is made to frame one of the eggs
a womans hand garnishes each bright yellow yolk with a slash of red pimento
the spatula reappears and lifts the results from the pan and slides them onto two small dark blue plates
now we see that loretta is just finishing setting the tin table for two
in the b
rose is turning away from the big old fashioned six range gas stove where an old speckled coffee pot is steaming up a sun drenched window
rose comes toward the table with the laden blue plates
shes wearing a nice old apron over a blue housedress
as rose comes to the table loretta in a blue denim work shirt and pants goes to the stove and gets the coffee
as rose puts breakfast on the table she speaks to loretta whos at the stove
will you live here
pop dont like johnny
loretta returns with the coffeepot to the table and pours
then she takes the pot back to the stove
so well sell the house
i got married before you didnt sell
loretta comes to the table
they sit down to breakfast
grandma was still alive
chiro was still home going to school
now hes married and gone to florida

the wall phone in the kitchen rings
loretta goes and answers it
yea this is loretta castorini yeah

johnny is calling on an old european style phone
in the b
is the sickbed
in the sickbed lies vesta mr
johnnys mother her grey hair spread out on a golden pillow
by the bed are three mourners old crones dressed in black
one clutches a missal the other two clutch rosaries
all three are grieving in a steady low wordless whine
johnny speaks into the phone in a confidential manner
there is some long distance crackle
ssh its me
im calling from the deathbed of my mother
how was your plane ride
the waitresses were very nice
glances over at his mother my mother is slipping away
calling to the heavens quanto tempo devo aspettare
now she aims more at johnny how long must i wait

im waiting till a moment when shes peaceful
we hear lorettas voice over his receiver

five years is too long for bad blood between brothers
nothing can replace your family
i see that now

loretta hangs up the phone
rose speaks from the table where shes still sitting
hows the mother
but i could still hear her big mouth
did he tell her
that old lady makes him sweat
to herself wheres that card
rose gets up and takes the dishes to the sink loretta fishes in her pocket and comes out with the business card mr
johnny gave her
she dials the number
who are you calling
chrissy a woman with a queens accent answers
cammareris bake shop
is ronny there
yells into intercom ronny the phone
yeah this is ronny

hes getting married and he wants you to come
theres a long pause
ronnys voice returns hoarse with emotion
why didnt he call himself
hes in palermo
whats wrong can never be made right
hangs up phone let me come and talk to you
loretta hangs up the phone
she looks at the card again makes a decision and pockets the card
as cosmo drives away
hes in a very good mood
he laughs to himself
and the street in front of it
shes wearing a long navy blue cloth coat and a knit hat
she looks up at the sign and at the business card in her hand and enters the shop
its a nice italian bake shop
three italian women chrissy barbara and ma wait on three women shoppers at the counter
chrissy and barbara are in their late s or early s ma is old old
loretta comes in and speaks to chrissy
is ronny cammareri here
he down at the ovens
what do you want
i would like to speak to him
chrissy comes out and loretta follows
they walk around to an outdoor staircase that descends into the sidewalk
chrissy shouts down
the door slides open revealing rocco a baker missing a few teeth
he is surrounded by bread
somebody to see ronny
rocco slides back the door all the way
chrissy and loretta make their way past him
he slides the door three quarters shut behind them
there are two coal fired ovens one at either end of the room
there is a large wooden table roughly center
and various pieces of baking equipment dough mixers etc
scattered willy nilly
and everywhere there is bread
pietro a baker is working at one of the ovens with a long wooden spatula
ronny is working at the other oven
actually he is just staring in the open door at the baking bread and burning coals
hes dressed in black jeans streaked with flour a white restaurant shirt white cotton gloves and around his neck a red handkerchief
he is black haired handsome and intense
somebody here to see you
ronny turns and takes in loretta
have you come from my brother
im going to marry him
you are going to marry my brother
do you want
i have no life
i have no life
my brother johnny took my life from me
i dont understand
everything in the oven room has stopped and everyone is watching
and now hes getting married
he has his hes getting his
and he wants me to come
what is life
he picks up the wooden spatula and slides it into the oven
i didnt come here to upset you
ronny slides a bunch of loaves out of the oven on the spatula turns them around and slides them back in
they say bread is life
so i bake bread bread bread
hes picking up loaves of bread from one of the boxes on the floor and casually tossing them across the room
and the years go by
and i sweat and shovel this stinking dough in and outta this hot hole in the wall and i should be so happy huh sweetheart
you want me to come to the wedding of my brother johnny
where is my wedding
over by the wall
gimme the big knife
barbara appears in the doorway and comes down the stairs into the room
gimme the big knife
im gonna cut my throat
maybe i should come back another time
no i want you to see this
i want you to watch me kill myself so you can tell my brother on his wedding day
chrissy gimme the big knife
i tell you i wont do it
to loretta do you know about me
nothing is anybodys fault but things happen
holds up his left hand to loretta look
he pulls off the glove
the hand is made of wood
five years ago i was engaged to be married
johnny came in here he ordered bread from me
i put it in the slicer and i talked with him and my hand got caught cause i wasnt paying attention
the slicer chewed off my hand
its funny cause when my fiance saw that i was maimed she left me for another man
thats the bad blood between you and johnny
but that wasnt johnnys fault
i dont care
i aint no freakin monument to justice
i lost my hand i lost my bride
johnny has his hand johnny has his bride
you come in here and you want me to put away my heartbreak and forget
he goes to the big table which is floured and covered with bread
he sweeps everything off the tabletop during the next
is it just a matter of time till a man opens his eyes and gives up his one dream of happiness
all i have
have you come here stranger bride of my brother to take these last few loaves from my table
the table is bare
he stares at it blankly
he wanders away to the back room where the flour sacks are kept
we hear a single sob escape him from that room and then silence
everyone in the oven room looks after him
then chrissy approaches loretta
she holds the big knife at her side
this is the most tormented man i have ever known
i am in love with this man
he doesnt know that
i never told him cause he can never love anybody since he lost his hand and his girl
she holds out the knife
why dont you just kill him
it would be so much more kind than coming here and inviting him to a wedding like hell never have
loretta considers chrissy decides what shes going to do and goes to the flour room
bags of flour are stacked under a bare electric bulb
a rough stone staircase opposite is lit by daylight from above
ronny quietly distraught stands leaning by his forehead against a stack of flour
loretta approaches him
she feels for him
where you live
he points to the stone staircase
she touches his shoulder
he follows her up the stairs
loretta and ronny emerge
they enter the apartment building behind the bakery
its a dark italian coffee and dessert house
reproductions of roman statuary adorn grottos and alcoves
in the back is a glass case displaying various desserts and behind the case a big burnished gold cappuccino machine
the place is almost empty
an album of neapolitan folk songs is playing on the cafes the camera travels along the face of an exposed brick wall discovering busts of romans occasionally and then it
comes to the figure of cosmo
hes sitting at a table which is inset into a nook so we cannot see who hes with
at a little table away from prying eyes cosmo sits with mona his girlfriend
mona is a pretty but overripe italian woman in her late forties
shes all done up and she looks at cosmo with adoration
and then there is copper which is the only pipe i use
it costs money
but it costs money because it saves money
and what did they say
the man understood me
the woman wanted to be cheap but the man saw that i was right
you have such a head for knowing
you know everything
i brought you something
he takes out a small velvet box and hands it to her
its a present
she opens the box
its a gold bracelet with a pattern of stars and birds
they are little stars and birds
birds fly to the stars i guess
a three story walk up above cammareris bakery
its a two bedroom apartment
the decor reflects ronnys love of the opera
the furniture is overstuffed fringed in the colors of italian passion
but it is all a bit faded the remains of an old flamboyance
the walls are decorated with opera posters and over the fireplace there is a painting depicting a scene from la boheme mimi is standing in the snow
ronny stares at the picture of mimi in the la boheme poster
loretta comes in from the kitchen and sets down a cup of coffee
you ready for the coffee
loretta moves back into the kitchen
ronny turns and watches as she walks down the hall
whats that smell
im making you a steak
you dont have to help me
i know that
i do what i want

youll eat this bloody to feed your blood
cu of ronnys artificial hand holding a fork stuck in a steak
with his right he is cutting his steak
he switches hands and eats hungrily

whered johnny find you
he knew my husband who died

ronny drops his knife and fork and turns away
loretta is not surprised and does not move

when your husband get hit by the bus

i have not been lucky

do you think youre the only one ever shed a tear
why you talking to me

the car has just come to a stop
we see cosmo mona kiss
she exits car
cosmo glances around with a slightly guilty look and pulls away
camera is close on scotch being poured into two glasses
loretta picks up her glass and swallows a healthy dose
she was right to leave me
you think so
you really are stupid you know that
loretta pours herself another shot
you dont know nothing about it
i was raised that a girl gets married young
i didnt get married until i was twenty eight
i met a man
i loved him
i married him
he wanted to have a baby right away
i said no
then he got hit by a bus
i did not know that man was a gift i could not keep
i didnt know
you tell me a story and you think you know what it means but i see what the true story is and you cant
she pours them both another drink she didnt leave you
you cant see what you are
i can see everything
you are a wolf
im a wolf
the big part of you has no words and its a wolf
this woman was a trap for you
she caught you and you could not get away
she grabs his wooden hand so you chewed off your foot
that was the price you had to pay to be free
throws his hand down johnny had nothing to do with it
you did what you had to do between you and you and i know im right i dont care what you say
and now youre afraid because you found out the big part of you is a wolf that has the courage to bite off its own hand to save itself from
the trap of the wrong love
thats why there has been no woman since that wrong woman
you are scared to death what the wolf will do if you make that mistake again
what are you doing
im telling you your life
why are you marrying johnny
hes a fool
because i have no luck
pounding on the table he made me look the wrong way and i cut off my hand
he could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your whole head
i am looking where i should to become a bride
a bride without a head
a wolf without a foot
ronny stiff arms everything off the dining table and grabs loretta
they kiss passionately
he pulls her up on the table and over the table to him
they are in each others arms
they are on fire
loretta pushes him away gasping for air
wait a minute
wait a minute
she changes her mind and lunges into another kiss
they stop again after a long moment
they really havent breathed
they both suck in air and look at each other in wonder and fear and passion
its like im falling
its like im in the ocean
they kiss again
when they pull apart again loretta is crying
i have no luck
he picks her up in his arms
son of a bitch
where are you taking me
to the bed
i dont care about anything
i dont care about anything
take me to the bed
he carries her away into the bedroom
music o soave fanciulla from la boheme
the music ronny is laying her down in the bed
he is over her
they look into each others eyes
i cant believe what is happening
i was dead
i was dead too
when they part there is a drop of blood on lorettas lips
all my life i have never reached a man
i knew that i would reach my husband but i took my time and he was dead
i want to cut you open and crawl inside of you
i want you to swallow me
ive got you
get all of me
what about johnny
youre mad at him take it out on me take your revenge on me
take everything leave nothing for him to marry
hollow me out so theres nothing left but the skin over my bones
suck me dry
there will be nothing left
their eyes are boiling with fierce animal tears
they have opened their souls to each other and they are coming together
the music swells to a terrible triumph
dog whines over exterior
with five beds for dogs
four of the beds are empty and on the fifth judas is whining
he looks around at the other beds
where is everybody
he goes out the bedroom door
judas is running down the stairs and into the hall
we follow him down the hall
the hall is only dimly lit
he finds the four other dogs
they are crowded at a narrow doorway
from the doorway comes a golden light
the camera pulls back
we are in the castorini dining room
cosmo sits at the head of the table a napkin tucked into his shirt
rose has just laid down a massive platter of steaming baked fish
already on the table is a platter of pasta loaves of bread a big bowl of salad two bottles of wine and an appetizer plate of salami and pimento
seated at the table is cosmo the old man and raymond and rita cappomaggi
raymond is rotund moon faced bald somewhere in his fifties
he has a pencil thin mustache over his small mouth
his wife rita looks very like him except she has hair on her head and none on her lip
raymond is roses brother
there are two empty places at table for rose and loretta
were gonna start without her
there is an accordion gate across it
behind the gate the five dogs stare at the people having dinner
she must be eating out
she dont know what shes missing
its not like her not to call
well shes got a lot on her mind
i mean can we talk about it rose
shes getting married again
i dont wanna talk about it
i think its great and about time
whats she gonna do with the rest of her life she dont get married
i dont wanna talk about it
the old man has piled his plate high with food
now he stands up walks over to the dogs and puts the plate down in their midst
the dogs attack the food and each other
the old man walks back to the table and sits down
he looks down at the empty place in front of him a little sad
my father needs a plate
rose gets another plate from a sideboard and puts it in front of the old man
he immediately methodically begins to fill his new plate
rose goes to her place and sits down
many years ago when they told me you were marrying my sister i was happy
when i told rose i was marrying rita she was happy
marriage is happy news
the old man laughs uproariously subsides goes back to filling his plate
rose pass the wine
i never seen anybody so in love like cosmo back then
hed stand outside the house all day and look in the windows
i never told you this cause its not really a story
but one time i woke up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face
like a flashlight
i couldnt think a what it was
i looked out the window and it was the moon
big as a house
i never seen the moon so big before or since
i was almost scared like it was gonna crush the house
and i looked down and standing there in the street was cosmo looking up at the windows
this is the funny part
i got mad at you cosmo
i thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you were so in love and woke me up with it
i was half asleep i guess and didnt know no better
you were altogether asleep
you were dreaming
you were there
raymond stares at cosmo nodding remembering
theres a lull at the table the sound of silverware
i dont wanna talk about it
suddenly angry well what do you wanna talk about
pass the wine
why you drinking so much
the old man gets up with his newly filled plate and heads for the dogs
old man if you give another piece of my food to those dogs im gonna kick you till youre dead
the old man reverses direction and heads back to his chair
he sits down and starts to eat
over the house is a great big full moon
the lights in the bedroom are still on
cosmo is in bed in his pajamas asleep
rose comes in her nightgown
she looks at cosmo
hes snoring lightly
he doesnt stir
she goes to him and runs her hand through his hair
you drank too much and now you sleep too hard and later youll be up when you should be down
she kisses his cheek
then she turns out the lights
when the electric lights go out moonlight floods the room
she goes to the window and looks out through the curtains at the moon
rose puts her face in her hands and quietly cries
castorini house master bedroom night rose crying
the bedroom is flooded by moonlight
loretta wakes up a little alarmed
ronny wakes up a little alarmed
i dont know
i think its the moon
loretta goes to the window wrapped in a white sheet from the bed
the window is glowing with moonlight
the moonlight strikes her and she is caught in its spell
ronny appears behind her pulling on a robe
they speak in low voices as if they were in church
its so bright
ive never seen a moon like that
it makes you look like an angel
she turns and looks at him
they break apart
ronny looks up at the moon
looks like a big snowball
shot of the house with the moon overhead
there is a big window right by the bed and in the window is the moon
raymond and rita are in their bed asleep
raymond wakes up and sees the moon in the window
hes stunned and excited but he too speaks in this low voice of respect
waking up what
its cosmos moon
what are you talking about raymond
cosmo cant own the moon
i mean its that moon i was talking about at dinner
looks through the window down into the street is he down there
is who down there
what would he be doing down there
i dont know
you know in this light and with that expression on your face you look about twenty five years old
raymond smiles at her meekly
over the house is still the great big full moon
the front door opens and out comes the old man with the five dogs
the old man is in a greatcoat and a felt hat and hes smoking a cigar
he stops on the top step and lets go a huge plume of cigar smoke
then he starts off with the dogs down the street
the moon and nothing else
then a cigar is thrown into it and sends it shimmering
it was the moon reflected in water
now the camera pulls back and we see the old man and the five dogs are standing on a ruined pier
the moon gleams up from the hudson river
the old man speaks to the dogs
the dogs do not howl
so the old man by way of demonstration howls at the moon
he looks to the dogs to follow suit
they do nothing
he howls at the moon again
the dogs do nothing
the camera continues to pull back until we can see the whole pier with the old man and the dogs on it and the moon above them
the old man frustrated now cries out
how long must i wait
quanto tempo devo aspettare
the dogs start to howl
the old man pleased as the mad hatter he is laughs and laughs
transition from moon reflecting in the water to dawn
morning sun floods the room
close on loretta she wakes up
oh my god
loretta jumps from bed grabs her clothes to cover herself and backs into closet
what have we done
perturbed take it easy
from closet as she hurriedly gets dressed this time i was trying to do everything right
he grabs a bathrobe pulls it on puts it on and moves towards the closet
dont just become excited
i thought if i stayed away from the city hall i wont have that bad luck i had again
youre trying to make me feel guilty
im marrying your brother
all right im guilty
youre invited to the wedding
its in a few weeks
why didnt you do like him and be with your dying mother in palermo
she didnt like me
you dont get along with anybody
what did you do
what did i do
you ruined my life
it was ruint when i got here
you ruint my life
oh no i didnt
loretta emerges from the closet tucking in her blouse
oh yes oh yes you did
youve got those bad eyes like a gypsy
why didnt i see it yesterday
is that all im ever gonna have
why didnt i just pick up a stone and kill myself years and years ago
im gonna marry him
last night never happened you hear me
im gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened and you and i are gonna take this to our coffins
i cant do that
im in love with you
loretta stares at him in alarm slaps his face then studies his face to see the effect of the slap
she is dissatisfied and slaps him again
snap out of it
then i must never see you again
the bad blood will have to stay there between you and johnny for all time
you wont come to the wedding
ill come to the wedding
im telling you you cant
but he wants me to come
but thats cause he dont know
i will not come
provided one thing
that you come with me tonight
to the opera
what are you talking about
i love two things
i love you and i love the opera
if i can have the two things that i love together for one night i will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life
meet me at the met
wheres the met
camera moves from stained glass windows to confessional
loretta is next in line of three sinners waiting to go into the confessional
a forgiven woman emerges from the curtained booth and walks off to pay her penance
loretta goes into the booth
the slide opens and an old priests face can be seen in outline through the screen
bless me father for i have sinned
its been two months since my last confession
what sins have you to confess
twice i took the name of god in vain once i slept with the brother of my fiance and once i bounced a check at the liquor store but that
was really an accident
then it was not a sin
but what was that second thing you said loretta
slept with my fiances brother
thats a pretty big sin
you should think about this
this is your penance
say two rosaries and
be careful loretta
reflect on your life
i absolve you in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit amen
loretta comes out of the confessional and enters a pew
she crosses herself
then she recognizes the back of a womans head a few pews down
she gets up walks down the aisle and kneels down next to her mother rose
looking up from her prayers where you been
i dont wanna talk about it
just like your father
i lied to him
he thinks you came home last night
whats the matter with you
cosmos cheating on me
how do you know
a wife knows
then you dont know
youre just imagining it
hes too old
rose starts to reply but then decides its not worth the argument
i wont be home for dinner
loretta crosses herself quickly gets up and leaves
rose looks after and then goes back to her prayer
feminine hands apply the final decorative touches of blue icing to a wedding cake
then the hands set the plastic bride and groom on the pinnacle
the camera pulls back
barbara is viewing her handiwork a wedding cake on a stainless steel wheeled cart
shes in the back part of the bakery
barbara is pleased with her creation
we travel with her as she rolls the cart out to the front of the store where chrissy is waiting on a huge man named harvey
she hands him a tiny box which he takes meekly
see you tomorrow chrissy
harvey lumbers off as barbara enters the front of the store with the cake on its cart
barbara calls chrissys attention to the cake
so what do you think
without enthusiasm wheres ronny
how come he aint come down
how should i know
the phone rings
chrissy answers it
she hangs up
that was ronny
he dont feel good
he aint gonna be down today
chrissy comes out from behind the counter
shes staring at the cake
what is he still upset
without warning chrissy whacks the little bride and groom off the cake and on to the floor
its that bitch
barbara looks at her shocked
an italian specialty store in little italy
provolones and salamis hang from above
to the one side is a deli counter to the other a series of tables displaying cheeses by the pound packaged cakes etc
in the back are a few tables and a kitchen with counter
up front behind the deli counter stands rita cappomaggi in a blue apron
out by the tables raymond unpacks some jars of olives
in the back a truck driver can dimly be seen eating his lunch
to rita i feel great i got no sleep but i feel like orlando furioso
looks around cautiously then speaks you were a tiger last night
and you were a lamb
as soft as milk
theyll hear you in the back
the pleasure of marriage is you sleep with the woman and then you dont worry about nothing
hey how about a date tonight rita
lets eat pasta and roll around
scandalized raymond raymond lower your voice
whats got into you
i dont know
that crazy moon cosmo sent over
loretta walks in
hey there sings to rita whats the matter with him
you got me
you see that moon last night
suspicious and guilty what about the moon
did you see it
she lies nervous no
listen i gotta go
ill take the deposit to the bank but ill do the books tomorrow
i gotta go
you gotta date
what are you talking about you fool
her fiances in palermo
i got things to do
sure you do
you got all that wedding stuff
well thats romantic too
he is walking towards the back now
he shouts to somebody in the kitchen
make me a bowl of minestrone
the women are left alone
whats the matter
you look crazy
i got a lot on my mind aunt rita
its been set up for a church bazaar
there are several wheels of fortune many stuffed animals coffee urns cakes a game of ring toss etc
as the camera inventories the contents of the various stands a little nun sleeps in one of them we hear the old mans voice
ive got a lot on my mind
things are getting bad in my house
my daughter in law is mad at my son because he will not pay for the wedding
an old gnarled hand reaches in and pulls one out dries it with a towel
the camera pulls back revealing that the hand belongs to lucy who is standing behind a table with the old man and felix
she hands the apple to the old man who drives a small wooden stake into it with a little wooden hammer
then the old man hands this staked apple to felix who dips it into a deep metal pot
it emerges shining with red candy goo
then felix sets the candled apple onto a papered tray where a dozen already sit
they repeat this process
but the old man because his thoughts are elsewhere takes forever to drive the stake into the apple
this frustrates felix
at dinner my daughter in law threatened to kill me
things are very bad in my house
if i hit the stick too hard the apple will split
if i am too timid the apple will fall off the stick
were supposed to do fifty apples
we only got twelve done
i dont know what to advise my son
i think he should pay for the wedding but it is important that he dont look ridiculous
dont make yourself sick
cosmo drank five glasses of wine at dinner
talk to him
but i must find the right moment
did you see the moon last night
the old mans eyes light up
he looks at lucy
in despair hurry up hurry up
we open in five minutes
by a womans hands
the last stack is topped with a filled out deposit slip
the banded stacks are then stuffed into a night deposit bag
the camera pulls back a bit to include a ledger
a last entry is made and the ledger is shut
the camera pulls back more and now we see loretta reaching for her coat
she puts it on picks up the deposit bag and sees rita
bye aunt rita
bye bye honey
see you tomorrow
yeah ill be in
loretta goes out the door with rita looking after thoughtful
loretta walks down the street and comes to the cinderella beauty shop fidgets a moment looks around to see if anybodys looking and goes in
we see her through the window talking to mildred who handles appointments
mildred nods points and loretta goes back into the store
we discover an uneasy loretta sitting in a beauty chair with bonnie her hairdresser about to start
bonnie is a little bored
you want the usual
i want you to get rid of the grey
this music should convey that loretta is turning from a frumpy pumpkin into a sleek and beautiful coach
bonnie wakes up upon hearing this startling news and gets very excited
ive been wanting to do this for three years
let me show you some magazines
youve got to get a manicure
and your eyebrows
im gonna need help
sheila another beautician joins bonnie and they both get very excited and start showing loretta and each other magazines
they argue merrily about what they should do leaving loretta far behind
a manicurist joins them with her stuff and starts soaking lorettas nails
theyre plucking her eyebrows
theyre cutting and dying her hair
theyre painting her nails
loretta comes out
her hair is jet black and done in a much more stylish way
she looks great
she looks around as if she has committed a crime and walks off quickly loretta looks in the windows is dissatisfied and walks on
a stylish dress shop called insinuation
loretta looks in the window is intimidated and walks on
a moment passes
tentatively she enters
loretta approaches a young woman mer who works there
mer is about thirty trendily dressed and french
mer and loretta greet and talk
loretta makes vague gestures trying to convey what she wants but the truth is she doesnt know what she wants
mer takes the situation in hand
there follows a montage of mer showing loretta various dresses some outlandish some beautiful some incomprehensible
loretta tries on several of the dresses in a big triple mirror
some horrify her some frighten her because theyre so sexy one bores her
we dont see the dress that she ultimately does buy
loretta walks out with a big shopping bag
she walks away down the street
we follow loretta away down the street
she comes to a bridal shop with a big bride dummy shown off in the window she stops and looks at the bride
she walks close to the window and stares in hard
then she slowly backs up from the bride
two nuns are walking by
loretta backing up from the dummy bumps into the nuns
shes flustered makes a brief apology and hurries away casting a furtive last glance at the shop window
night is falling
loretta appears and enters the house
as loretta enters she drops her bag and as she takes off her coat calls
a single bark is heard from the top of the stairs
she looks up
visible behind the gate are a couple of dogs
loretta goes through a door and into the kitchen
she opens the refrigerator and a cabinet and makes herself a scotch on the rocks
she sips it and starts to hum in an understated way
she takes her drink and wanders out of the kitchen
she walks to each lamp in the room and turns it on
there are many table and standing lamps throughout the room
which was already built in the fireplace
it catches on nicely
she puts her drink down and gets a big standing antique mirror on rollers from its place against the wall
she wheels it to a central place in the room
satisfied she picks up her drink again leaves the room for a moment and then returns with her shopping bag
she throws it on a chair
then she goes to the stereo and looks through the albums
she selects one and puts it on
loretta waltzes around in front of the mirror flirting with herself in a very serious way
she starts to unbutton her blouse
the moon is overhead as music continues to play
the camera soars up close to the moon until it completely fills the frame with its magic
the moon dissolves into close up of lorettas face as she puts the final touches on her make up
music continues to play
the camera pulls back
we see her full figure
she has changed into her evening dress and put on her heels
shes swaying to the music
the evening dress is sensational
she leans forward and kisses the mirror
in the mirror all around the kiss is reflected the fire
the moon is reflected in the water as we see the dock of the night before
we can see jersey lit up across the river
but then something starts to replace jersey
its a huge white liner coming down the river now all of her lights burning heading back out to sea
flashbulbs go off along the deck
we watch the length of the great ship pass as the crowds of people in beautiful clothes fill the plaza created by the three great buildings
a glorious fountain filled with lights forms the centerpiece
behind the fountain grand and splendidly lit is the magical metropolitan opera house
two huge chagalls one to the right and one to the left inhabit the face of the building filling it with marvelous color
the fountain is quiet and dark now
loretta is puzzled
she remembers that it was going
while she looks it lights up
then small jets of water begin to appear
then larger jets
then with a roar the central shaft of water rises high higher into the night sky
she follows the column of water with her eyes up into the sky
right above the crest of the water like a beanball on a seals nose is the moon
forming an opaque wall before her
then the fountain for its next piece of aquatic choreography drops away to nothing quite suddenly
and there facing loretta on the opposite side of the fountain is ronny
hes looking incredibly handsome and dashing in a tuxedo and topcoat and of course gloves
he smiles slightly and raises a hand in greeting
loretta caught off guard smiles brilliantly at him
then she remembers her situation and starts to put on her usual serious expression
but the fountain has rushed up into the sky again obscuring her attempt at composure from ronny
ronny comes into view again walking toward loretta around the fountains perimeter
he comes close to her
you look beautiful
i thought id try it
qrudgingly you look good
he goes to kiss her
she takes a step back
i said id go to the opera with you
ronny immediately relents gently takes her arm and they walk off in the direction of the opera house
ronny and loretta looking up at it
who painted that
he was having some fun
yeah well hes dead
he smiles come on lets go in
ronny and loretta join the crowd streaming into the building
ronny and loretta enter giving tickets to usher
ronny and loretta checking their coats
ronnys coat is already off and hes helping loretta off with hers
he hands her coat to the checker and pockets the check
then he turns and sees loretta in her dress for the first time
hes stunned by her beauty
hes at a loss
i dont know
for your hair
for your beautiful dress
you know i feel like a man again
you know i love the opera
you know its been a long time since ive been to the opera
his eyes are bright with tears
loretta is touched and starts to put her hand out to him
but she stops herself
where are we sitting
he takes her arm
they pass under the great chandelier and go into the house
the first couple is peggy and clive a very distinguished pair of silver haired lovers dressed magnificently
they are in their seats delighted to be where they are holding hands
next is the celebrity couple
maybe jackie o and her son john
they are seated and people are looking at them
next is cosmo and mona
cosmo is helping mona to sit down something she could probably handle herself
hes wearing good but old fashioned suit
she is in a dress that makes her look like a big piece of hard candy
next is ronny and loretta
they are sitting in the first row of the first circle in other words very good seats
they are holding their programs
loretta opens her program
the opera is la boheme
but then the page fades away into the dark as the house lights go down
ronny leans his head toward her and whispers
here we go
as the lights come up in the orchestra pit
the conductor takes his place
the audience applauds
he bows and turns to the orchestra
the overture begins and plays under next
the overture plays through this establishing shot and then fades away at the start of the next shot
we see rose enter the restaurant
the dinner crowd is in and most of the tables are occupied
the entranceway door opens and rose enters
shes got herself up very nice
the host jimmy quickly approaches her
shes very dignified
its just me
i want to eat
i got a table for you right now
jimmy leads her to a table for two against the wall
he seats her
enjoy your meal
jimmy breezes off
theres another table for two against the wall to roses front
we see a womans back from roses pov and a pretty head of hair
this woman whose name is sheila is having an argument with the man across from her
but the mans face is blocked by sheilas back and head and the argument is too low to be made out
bobo approaches roses table
good evening mrs
you eating alone tonight
let me have a martini no ice and two olives
bobo heads off for the bar
the couple at the next table catches roses attention again and their argument becomes a little louder
im trying to explain to you how i feel
every time i try to explain how i feel you explain how you feel
i dont think thats really much of a response
well its the only response ive got
bobo reappears with the martini and serves it
you wanna see a menu
bobo is gone
rose is mildly intrigued with the argument at the next table now
she tries to see past sheila to see the man but she cant without making too big a move
the argument goes on
i really do hate it though when you take that tone with me
like youre above it all and isnt it amusing
but it is isnt it
not to me
this is my life no matter how damned comical it may seem to you
i dont need some man standing above the struggle while i roll around in the mud
i think you like the mud and i dont
thats fair isnt it
if i dont care to
sheila stands up abruptly and flings a glass of water in the mans face
she pulls her coat off the back of her chair and stalks off
this whole operation took about two seconds
when she stalks off the face of the man becomes visible to rose for the first time
its perry the professor in his s who appeared and was treated in a similar way in the earlier scene in this restaurant
his face is covered with beads of water
he pats his face with his napkin and apologizes to customers at neighboring tables
sorry about that folks
shes a very pretty mental patient
the shy waiter arrives to assist perry in drying himself
dont mind about me
but could you do me a favor and clear her place and take away all evidence of her and bring me a big glass of vodka
the shy waiter heads for the bar
for the first time perry notices rose
they are facing each other with no obstacles in the way now
im sorry if we disturbed you
im not disturbed
my lady friend has a personality disorder
she was just too young for you
the shy waiter serves perry his drink
to the waiter thanks comrade
the shy waiter goes
roses comment strikes home ouch
i just got that
you know how to hurt guy
how old are you
none of your business
he drops his posturing
that was rude
will you join me for dinner

then id be delighted
i hate eating alone and its amazing how often i end up doing just that
what do you do
im a professor

why do men chase women
i think its because they fear death
you wanna know why i chase women

i teach these classes ive taught for a million years
the spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago
i started off i was excited about something and i wanted to share it
now its rote its the multiplication table
sometimes im droning along and i look up and theres this fresh young beautiful face and its all new to her and im this great guy whos just brilliant and
thinks out loud
and when that happens when i look out among those chairs and look at a young womans face and see me there in her eyes me the way i always
wanted to be and maybe once was then i ask her out on a date
it doesnt last
it can go for a few weeks or a couple of precious months but then she catches on that im just a burnt out old gasbag and that shes as
fresh and bright and full of promise as moonlight in a martini
and at that moment she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face or some action to that effect
what you dont know about women is a lot
throngs of people talking talking talking
piled up at the bars to get drinks
outside the womens bathroom with its huge line waiting to get in
loretta and three other women freshen their makeup before a mirror
the woman next to loretta leaves and is replaced by mona
mona and loretta stand side by side freshening their makeup
many people pressing to the bar to buy drinks
cosmo and ronny achieve the bars perimeter at the same moment and start to order
a concessionaire selling special glossy la boheme programs
ronny and loretta are standing by a column holding drinks
loretta is looking around
they get some turnout for this stuff
its the best thing there is
i like parts of it but i dont really get it
in another part of the lobby during intermission cosmo and mona are sitting on a bench
you havent once said you like my dress
i like your dress
he thinks its very bright
he looks around
why you looking around so much
i dont know
i got a feeling
im wearing your bracelet
he nods still looking around
indicating the end of intermission
the audience starts to file back into the theatre
rose and perry emerge from the restaurant
may i walk with you a ways
they set off to the left
the door opens and the old man comes out in his great coat and hat with the five dogs
he strikes off to the right
rose and perry come around a corner and pass a store
they pause and look at the christmas decorations in the window
they continue walking
the old man and the dogs have stopped by a big tree
which the dogs adore
rose and perry walking
they exit camera left
the old man drags the dogs away from the tree and sets off camera right
rose and perry walking to the left
the old man and the dogs walking to the right
rose and perry are walking towards camera
rose stops short stunned and alarmed by what she sees before them
the old man pulls up the dogs
aghast by what he sees before him
perry and rose face the old man and the dogs
in a silent standoff
perry is puzzled but has the sense to say nothing
after a long moment the old man silently steers his dogs past them
he walks away down the dark street silently disappearing into the gloom
perry and rose never move but follow his slow progress until he disappears
you knew that man
its the scene in which mimi is standing in the falling snow
she sings to rudolph
it is a beautiful poignant moment
the snow is falling falling
mimi is singing her heartbreaking aria of farewell
the lighted tavern window is behind them glowing with a golden light
hes staring intently at the stage with shining eyes
he wants to share this moment with loretta but he is timid she will not feel as he does
a single tear trails down her cheek
otherwise she is almost succeeding in hiding that the opera is moving her
she notices ronnys hand creeping towards hers but makes no move towards it
she and rudolph join hands
grab each others hand fiercely
at last they look at each other
she is admitting that she is affected by the opera
he is grateful that she admits it
the lobby overflowing with the audience coming out
ronny and loretta at the coatcheck
loretta dabs her eyes and blows her nose
that was just so
giving the check to the checker yeah
i couldnt believe it
i didnt think she was going to die
i knew she was sick
ronny gets the coats and helps her on with hers
she had tb
ronny is putting on his coat
she was coughing her brains out
and still she had to sing all the time
loretta has stopped suddenly transfixed by the sight before her
loretta and ronny are standing face to face with cosmo and mona
monas wearing a coat like a wrapper for hard candy
cosmo is wearing his coat and has his hat in his hand
stunned at seeing loretta he unconsciously puts his hat on
then he thinks about it and takes it off again
he looks at ronny
then he looks at mona
ronny looks at loretta
he waits to follow her lead
wait for me by the doors mona
mona obeys after looking curiously at loretta
what are you doing here
cosmo approaches ronny
he takes lorettas arm and steers her a distance away for a confidential exchange
whatd you do to your hair
i got it done
what are you doing here
what are you doing here
who is this man
youre my daughter
i wont have you acting like a tramp
youre my father
i didnt see you here
i dont know whether i saw you or not
cosmo puts on his hat again
he glares at ronny
he looks at loretta but hes at a total loss
at last he stalks off
loretta looks after him angry and disturbed
ronny appears at her side solicitous
lets get outta here
ill buy you a drink
loretta still looking after slowly shakes her head
that wasnt my mother
rose and perry stand on a sidewalk under a street light dimly shining
about half a block away stands the castorini house
they regard it
over the house hangs the moon cut through now with a sharp grey cloud
rose and perrys voices can be heard
thats my house
you mean the whole house
my god its a mansion
its a house
i live in a one bedroom apartment
what exactly does your husband do
hes a plumber
that explains it
the sound of the wind can be heard rising up
the rising cold wind stirs their hair
they both shiver slightly
i guess you cant invite me in
i think the house is empty
i cant invite you in because im married and because i know who i am
im a little cold
youre a little boy and you like to be bad
we could go to my apartment
you could see how the other half lives
im too old for you
im too old for me
thats my predicament
she kisses him on the cheek
can i kiss you on the cheek too
he kisses her on the cheek
im freezing good night
she walks away towards the house
perry shivering looks after
ronny and loretta sit at the bar
they are just finishing a couple of old fashions
the barman al inspects their drinks
another old fashion
to al i think thats it
al nods and walks off
ronny leans forward to loretta
what do you want to do now
i wanna go home
ronny and loretta are walking
their breath is coming out in long plumes
its really cold
it smells like snow
they walk in silence for a moment then loretta speaks
my mother guessed that my father was seeing somebody and i told her she was crazy
she looked like a real piece of cheap goods
but who am i to talk
her eyes are full of tears
whats the matter
how can you ask me that
youre making me feel guilty again
you are guilty
only god can point the finger loretta
i know what i know
and what do you know
you tell me my life
ill tell you yours
im a wolf
you run to the wolf in me that dont make you no lamb
youre gonna marry my brother
why you wanna sell your life short
playing it safe is just about the most dangerous thing a woman like you could do
you waited for the right man the first time why didnt you wait for the right man again
he didnt come
its ronnys building
this is your place
this is where were going
the deal was if i came to the opera with you youd leave me alone forever
she looks for his response
he makes none
i went with you
pause nothing now im gonna marry johnny and youre gonna leave me alone
pause nothing right
nothing a person can see where theyve messed up in their life and they can change how they do things and they can change their luck
maybe my nature does draw me to you but i dont haveta go with that
i can take hold of myself and say yes to some things and no to something thats just gonna ruin everything
i can do that
otherwise what is this stupid life that god gave us for what
pause nothing ronny
are you listening to me
im really afraid
im afraid of who i am
and youre not now
he shakes his head
i dont know
everything seems like nothing now against that i want you in my bed
i dont care if i burn in hell
i dont care if you burn in hell
the past and future is a joke to me now
i see that theyre nothing i see they aint here
the only thing thats here is you
i want you to come upstairs
i tried to take everything last night like you told me but i couldnt
i couldnt take everything in a hundred years
its the way we are
we compound each other
let me go home
let me go home
im freezing to death
i dont care why you come
no thats not what i mean
loretta i love you
not like they told you love is and i didnt know this either
but love dont make things nice it ruins everything it breaks your heart it makes things a mess
were not here to make things perfect
snowflakes are perfect
the stars are perfect
we are here to ruin ourselves and break our hearts and love the wrong people and die
the storybooks are bullshit
come upstairs with me baby
dont try to live your life out to somebody elses idea of sweet happiness
dont try to live on milk and cookies when what you want is meat
red meat just like me
its wolves run with wolves and nothing else
youre a wolf just like me
come upstairs with me and get in my bed
loretta follows ronny into his building
just as the door shuts
a moment passes
lights go on in ronnys apartment
out of a doorway on the opposite side of the street steps the figure of a woman
she walks to the middle of the deserted street and looks up at the lighted windows
her heart is about to break
she loves this man
she looks up at the lighted windows her feelings hanging by one slender slender thread
its mimis aria from the snow scene in la boheme
at the lighted window above
mimis aria plays
this tableau reminds us of the scene in the opera where mimi stands in the snow
the music plays and the woman sings for a long moment
then the lights in the apartment go out
chrissy shudders almost imperceptibly
her heart has broken
she hangs her head
then she lifts her head and slowly walks away down the street
with a great and abrupt roar a big jet is landing
passengers are pouring into the terminal from the plane
most of them are italian or italian americans
johnny appears out of the shifting crowd up very close to the camera
he looks alert determined geared up for action
he pulls his two suitcases off the carousel with one quick powerful jerk
johnny sticks out his hand and a cab immediately rushes to him
johnny leans forward to the driver and says in a very definite determined way
the cab rushes off into the night
the cab pulling up to the castorini house
the living room windows are all lit up
vicki carr can be made out singing it must be him
johnny gets out of the cab gets his luggage and heads for the front door
he rings the bell
the door opens
music floods out around her
im sorry to call so late
rose is a little tipsy
i came right from the airport
come on in
she holds the door open for him and he goes in past her carrying his suitcases
she closes the door
can you wake up loretta
i need to talk to her
shes not home yet
take off your coat and come in the living room
ill make you a drink
i wanna talk to you
rose comes in with two scotches on the rocks
he takes one
she turns off the stereo and then sits down across from him
where is she
i dont know where
i was waiting up for my husband
theres a pause
johnny is uncomfortable with it
maybe i should go
what are you doing here
youre supposed to be in palermo
thats what i came to tell loretta
theres been a miracle
well thats news
my mothers recovered
the breath had almost totally left her body
she was as white as snow
and then she completely pulled back from death and stood up and put on her clothes and began to cook for everyone in the house
she ate a meal that would choke a pig
the front door can be heard slamming out of view and then dogs can be heard barking
johnny and rose look to the entranceway
the old man appears there holding the five dogs
the old man looks at rose
he is a specter
he stares and then he makes a long low accusing noise
then he disappears
who was that
that was my father in law who has a wrong idea in his head
listen johnny theres a question i want to ask you
and i want you to tell me the truth if you can
why do men chase women
theres the bible story
god took a rib from adam and made eve
maybe men chase women to get the rib back
when god took the rib he left a hole there place where there used to be something
and the women have that
maybe a man isnt complete as a man without a woman
but why would a man need more than one woman
i dont know
maybe because he fears death
rose leaps up very excited
thats the reason
i dont know
no thats really it
thank you for answering my question
the front door slams again
johnny and rose look to the entranceway
cosmo appears there
taking in mr
where you been
i dont know rose
i dont know where ive been and i dont know where im going
johnny you should have your eyes opened for you my friend
i have my eyes open
you do huh
dont go on any long trips
i dont know what you mean
i know you dont
thats the point
ill say no more
you havent said anything
and thats how much im saying
i just want you to know
no matter what you do
you are going to die just like everybody else
thank you rose
im going to bed now
johnny stands up
cosmo walks off out of view
from top of stairs good
johnny he doesnt like you
thank you for answering my question
you dont know where loretta is
then tell her ill come by in the morning
we need to talk
okay ill tell her
we watch the effect of the sun coming up on the house
it begins in darkness and goes through the many graduations of light very quickly until its lit by the light of bright morning
hes got them on their leashes and over his head he carries the black umbrella
he walks off toward the park and disappears
along a sidewalk a couple of blocks away
she is a wreck
shes still in her clothes of the night before
she hasnt slept
her hairs a bit funny
and shes tormented by the complications in her life
and at the same time she looks great
she looks like shes been loved up and down
she has a hickey on her neck
her eyes are dreamy and her walk is slow utterly careless and sexual
shes carrying crunched in her hand her program from la boheme
she starts singing
we follow her as she sings and walks
shes still muttering
she comes to a tin can
she kicks lt
she comes to it again
she kicks it again
loretta appears kicking her can
she abandons the can and enters the house
rose is at the stove
the kitchen is filled with steam and sunlight
rose is stirring a pot filled with oatmeal
another range has the coffeepot heating
loretta shuffles into the kitchen goes to the tin table and sits down
there are red roses on the table
rose sees loretta
what the hell happened to you
i dont really know where to start
your hairs different
are you drunk
are you drunk
but i have a hangover
johnny cammareri showed up last night
loretta is suddenly electrified
hes in sicily
no more hes not
hes with his dying mother
she was dying
it was a miracle
this is modern times
there aint supposed to be miracles any more
i guess it aint modern times in sicily
he came right from the airport
he wanted to talk to you
you got a love bite on your neck
hes coming back this morning
with a long low moan loretta lowers her head to the table
ronny is walking along the same stretch of sidewalk as loretta just was
he looks like hell too
his hair is wild and he hasnt slept
hes thrown on an old leather jacket and brown leather gloves
he has a love bite on his neck too
he starts to sing o soave fanciulla
he sings it any old way occasionally getting a good attack occasionally just muttering his way through
sings as much of it as he remembers which is a lot
hes singing away carelessly sauntering along
he passes an italian couple of middle age
they smile as they recognize what he is singing
they start to sing along with him
they sing till they get to the ceiling of the aria and to a resting place a little beyond
then they nod to each other appreciatively and go on their ways ronny turning his back to the camera and they walking into it
ronny appears and approaches the door
he knocks waits and then rings the bell
rose answers the door and invites him in
rose walks in with ronny behind her
theres no one in the kitchen
rose calls out
its not johnny
loretta comes out of a closet where she was hiding
shes very surprised to see ronny
is johnny here
we can get this out on the table
to rose im ronny johnnys brother
shakes her hand nice to meet you
youve got a love bite on your neck
your mothers recovered from death
were not close
im not really moved
youve gotta get outta here
im gonna wait
arguing with ronny ronny please
would anyone like some oatmeal
loretta continues arguing
ignores loretta yes i would like some oatmeal
ronny and loretta sit down and rose serves them oatmeal
cosmo walks in dressed for business
he regards the trio puts on his hat in shock and then takes it off again
cosmo this is ronny johnnys brother
cosmo sits down
rose puts a bowl of oatmeal in front of him
he absently begins to eat it
a silence reigns
then he puls down his spoon
youre johnnys brother
cosmo picks up his spoon and they all eat silently once more
the sound of dogs barking comes up and then fades away
he looks at the assemblage
the assemblage looks at him
he points at rose
then his pointing drifts to cosmo and his hand opens in a gesture of supplication
i am old
the old are not wanted
and what they say has no weight
but my son i must speak
you should pay for the wedding of your only daughter
you are breaking your house through pride
ive said it
its okay pop
if she gets married ill pay for the whole thing
the old man lets go a great noise of relief sits down at the table and waits
rose brings him a bowl of oatmeal
he is content now and eats his oatmeal with great relish
the others eat with a more meaningful silence
rose puts down her spoon
she looks at the table but she is speaking to cosmo
have i been a good wife
i want you to stop seeing her
everyone stops eating
a tremendous silence falls
an old clock goes tick tick tick
suddenly cosmo smashes his fists to the table and stands
he doesnt look at rose during this
then slowly he sits down
and go to confession
still not looking at her a man
under stands one day
that his life is built on nothing
and thats a bad crazy day
your life is not built on nothing
she puts her hand across the table to him
he slides his hand out and takes her hand
slowly he lifts his eyes
their eyes meet
its the first time hes been able to hold her gaze in this whole story
the doorbell rings
ill get it
lorettas tone is fatal
ill get it
rose gets up
ill get it
she goes to answer the door
goes for the door no ill tell him
no ill tell him
to her father what am i going to tell him
tell him the truth loretta they find out anyway
loretta looks at her father
i love you pop
its a private moment
but who appears at the kitchen door is not johnny
its the they have their coats on and they look very serious and concerned and timid
why aint you at the store
is there anything you want to tell us honey
we just come from the bank
oh my god i forgot to to raymond shes got it
i knew she had it
loretta runs out of the kitchen and reappears with her everyday bag
she takes out the night deposit bag and hands it to raymond
we didnt know what to think
you were so weird yesterday and then this morning we go to the bank and no bag
a sudden outburst to loretta raymond covers his face to hide his emotion
rita meanwhile is clearing the oatmeal bowls
who wants coffee
there is a general acknowledgment
everybody wants coffee
rose passes out white mugs and begins pouring steaming drafts of coffee
raymond and rita are standing
the rest are sitting
so what are we doing
were waiting for johnny cammareri
im his brother
taking and shaking his hand nice to meet you
im rita cappomaggi
taking and taking his hand im raymond cappomaggi
im roses brother
nice to meet you
then the old man erupts
somebody tell a joke
the doorbell rings
and rings again
everyone is frozen for a moment then rita mobilizes
ill get it
loretta puts down her coffee and deep breathes preparing herself
im getting palpitations
she pushes away her coffee
i thought he was in palermo
rita continues into the room leaving mr
johnny in the doorway
he is in a dark vested suit
he is a little bewildered by the crowd of people but succeeds in hiding most of his discomfort
its johnny cammareri
our mother has recovered from death
have you come to make peace with me
you may not want to
of course i want to
i dont know
but johnny how did your mother recover
she was dying
we should talk alone
i need my family around me now
i told my mother that we were to be married
and she got well
im sure she did
it was a miracle
johnny i have something to tell you
i have something to tell you
but i must talk to you alone
i have no secrets from my family
loretta i cant marry you
if i marry you my mother will die
the old man laughs a loud sudden laugh and then subsides
what the hell are you talking about
loretta what are you talking about
im talking about a promise
you proposed to me
because my mother was dying
but now shes not
youre forty two years old johnny and mama is still running your life
and you are a son who doesnt love his mother
and youre a big liar
ive got your ring here
i must ask for that back
loretta struggles and pulls off the ring
take your stupid pinky ring
she throws it at johnny who needs it
the engagements off
johnny retrieves the ring
in time you will see that this is the best thing
in time you will drop dead and i will come to your funeral in a red dress
will you marry me
wheres the ring
ronny looks to mr
johnny a little sheepishly
could i a
borrow that ring
johnny in shock hands it over to ronny
he kneels down before loretta
he presents the ring to her
will you marry me loretta castorini clark
before all these people yes i will marry you ronny cammareri
she takes the ring
ronny and loretta kiss
do you love him loretta
yeah ma i love him awful
oh god thats too bad
ronny and loretta enter into a long kiss
the old man starts to cry
cosmo leans forward to the old man solicitously
whats the matter pop
lifts his head and cries out loretta pushes ronny away breaking the kiss
they have both neglected to breathe the whole time they were kissing
they are both gasping for air especially loretta
wait a minute
wait a minute
but then she looks at ronny and lunges back to him diving into another kiss like a mermaid diving into the bluest ocean
o soave fanciulla from la boheme comes up and engulfs the lovers the family the world
we see the faces of the lovers swirl away into a golden and diamond light and glistening in sunlight on the white tabletop
into each is dropped a lump of sugar
a bottle of recently employed bitters sits nearby with its cap off like a respectful peasant in aristocratic company
and the roses in the center
now the camera pulls back
we see the table is surrounded
cosmo is dropping the last of the sugar cubes in the last glass of champagne
rose is by him
rita and raymond are side by side as are ronny and loretta
the old man sits staring at his son intent and approving
but where is mr
everybody take a glass
everybody takes a glass
the old man takes one and gets up to cosmo wait
the old man takes the glass and walks over to a corner of the kitchen where mr
johnny deeply disturbed and somewhat catatonic sits on a step ladder
continuing to mr
johnny offering the glass here
i dont want it
but the old man wise and merry and tough presses the glass on mr
johnny who takes it
they all lift their glasses
and looking into each others eyes
who knocks back his drink lustily and then with a glittering eye looks away from the table
johnny sits without moving holding his glass
a long moment passes
johnny is thinking
then he nods to himself
he lifts his glass and murmurs for no one to hear to family
and he laughs his laugh
this laugh could kill him
the camera pulls back a little
he pounds the table and knocks over the roses
