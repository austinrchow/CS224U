written by lee eisenberg gene stupnitsky june to establish
a school marquee with removable plastic letters reads good luck with finals
a janitor opens the glass and starts removing the letters
a champagne cork hits the ceiling
teachers who rarely get to drink at work jockey for position holding out their plastic flutes
note female teachers outnumber male teachers
principal wally snur s balding faces the teachers
he has a habit of blinking hard before speaking
well its been another great year here at jams
who can forget mr
pinkus haunted classroom
sandy thank you
sandy pinkus s sporting a ponytail smiles clearly enjoying the small compliment
i aint afraid of no ghost
the other teachers laugh
or the wild success of
wally can i just say one quick thing
wally turns to amy squirrel late s cute and wholesome
any trace of sexuality she might have is wiped away by her adult pigtails
she treats students and adults alike like students
just wanted to remind everyone the school days not over
so lets keep the drinking under control hmm
back to you wally
a bunch of teacher roll their eyes
thanks amy then back to his notes or the wild success of the book drive for the womens prison sponsored by ms
a broad shouldered teacher with spiky hair ms
but now as the summer is upon us its time to not only say goodbye to another school year but to also say goodbye to a member of our faculty
elizabeth can you come up here
elizabeth halsey mid s pretty and petite walks up to the front
she sports an enormous diamond ring and dresses slightly more cosmopolitan than the other teachers
youve only been with us for one short year but know that youll always be a part of the jams family
elizabeth gives principal snur an appreciative smile
the teachers lightly applaud
and we got you a little something
wally hands elizabeth an envelope
she opens it and
pulls out a gift card boston market
almost forty dollars
why dont you say a couple words
im not really good at this type of thing so ill make it quick
i know ive only been here a year but theres so much im going to miss
elizabeth sits at her desk cleaning it out
shes tossing the few personal effects she has into a bankers box
my students probably most of all
im not saying they were little angels butthey were all there to learn and thatsthe greatest gift a student can give a teacher
elizabeths class is horsing around enjoying the last days of seventh grade
a dim looking boy tentatively approaches her desk with his yearbook in hand
he hands it to elizabeth who considers what to write for a beat then smiles as she signs it
elizabeth walks down the hall holding her box
sixth seventh and eighth graders all race past her running toward their summer vacation
and i wish that i had gotten to know all of you better but between four classes and planning a wedding i had my hands full
from the little i do know about you i know that our students are in good hands
elizabeth passes amys classroom where she is carefully removing inspirational posters from her walls and rolling them into cardboard tubes
three middle school burnouts are smoking weed in a thicket on the outskirts of the school property
and i cant believe its all over
this year flew by
and even though ill never teach again professionally ive realized that i dont need a blackboard and classroom to set an example
elizabeth comes up behind them
hand it over
the burnouts eyes all go wide and they freeze
one of the burnouts hands her the joint
the kids look at each other and then pull out a bag with a couple of joints
they hand it over to elizabeth
this was a warning
next time i dont call the principal
i call the cops
elizabeth walks to her brand new mercedes
she gets in pulls out a joint and lights it
she takes a huge toke and then peels out of the lot
she tosses her bankers box out the window and extends her hand giving the school the finger
a couple students look at her strangely
the dim looking kid that had elizabeth sign his yearbook
he flips to the faculty section and by the picture of elizabeth is her message you are illiterate
struggling to read you are
elizabeths car comes barrelling toward him and nearly hits him
she accelerates into the speed bumps almost hitting the janitor from the opening shot whos changing the plastic letters to read have a great summer
a mercedes with the vanity plate his is parked in the driveway of an upscale neighborhood
elizabeths matching mercedes pulls into the adjacent spot
her license plate reads hers
a bachelor pad
top of the line electronics
lots of black leather furniture
tacky but expensive
elizabeth pours two glasses of wine and takes a long sip
mark early s exits the bedroom in his underwear
hes shaved his head to avoid signs of early balding and is also a full four inches shorter than elizabeth
thankfully for him he has money
that was a quick party
elizabeth kisses mark on the top of his head and hands him a glass
you should have seen it
what a joke
she raises her glass for a toast
he raises his
heres to me never having to work again
and i owe it all to you lover
elizabeth takes a big sip
so i made a reservation at ruths chris and then i booked us a suite at the drake and i thought we could finish the night in anal alley
something drops in the bedroom
mark alarmed turns towards the door
elizabeth brushes past him into elizabeth enters to find nothing
mark follows her in
elizabeth looks around under the bed in the closet behind the door
just then the wooden chest at the foot of the bed sneezes
elizabeth opens the latch to find sheila dressed only in a thong scrunched in the fetal position
she stands revealing large fake breasts and steps out of the chest
how could you do this to me
you are buying me the biggest pair of yellow diamond earrings they make
im talking serious blood diamonds
sheila sneezes again
get out of my house bitch
dont talk to her like that
i love her
mark puts his arm around sheila
elizabeth eyes sheilas large breasts
you love her
shes a hooker
shes not a hooker
elizabeth takes a deep breath
listen marky you made a mistake
and this time it was you
maybe six months from now youll walk in on me
i dont know but probably
sheila sneezes again
shut the fuck up
then to mark sweet and
maybe im talking crazy but i dont want to throw away our life together over something like this
were getting married
im willing to fight for us
and you know why
because sheila loves me and not just for my money
sheila squeezes his shoulder
im sorry if i care that my future husband can support me
we didnt all grow up with a silver spoon in our mouths
you cant even imagine what its like going to bed hungry night after night
what are you talking about
both your parents are cpas
my parents worked their asses off to send me to private school
do you know what its like driving a pontiac when everyone else gets a beemer the second they menstruate
that shit stays with you
its over elizabeth
for the record theres a shitload of things that i hate about you but i still wouldve gotten married
beat sweet because i love you
rolls his eyes im gonna need the ring back
she grabs her bag and heads for the exit
you sad little troll
i hope you and your hooker enjoy chlamydia together
not turning around im not even listening to you anymore
she starts to open the door
he closes it
like i even want your gay ass ring
she tries pulling it off
its not coming off
ill go to the jewelers tomorrow
mark takes her hand and removes the ring with ease
elizabeth steps out into the night
the door slams behind her
a red grand am with a cracked windshield peels into the half empty lot and screeches to a halt
the license plate reads hers
elizabeth walks down the empty hall
its possible a person has never looked less happy to be anywhere
faint soft rock plays from an open door
something from inside the classroom catches elizabeths eye
under her breath youve gotta be shitting me
the room has been decorated to within an inch of its life
every surface is covered with posters like noted african americans or hispanic american hall of fame or women who dared
a red delicious apple has been placed on each students desk
amy dressed casually in cargo shorts and texas is trying to hang a large integrity poster
she looks over sees elizabeth staring at her and immediately lights up
elizabeth halsey as i live and breathe
i know we barely got a chance to get to know one another last year what with you planning the wedding of the century and me juggling all my extra
currics but i just want to say that im super excited to be across the hall mates
and i know you kinda skated by last year doing the bare minimum thing you were kind of a lone wolf but now youre back and i just know that
you are going to rededicate yourself to the task at amy notices elizabeths bare hands
wheres your beautiful ring
my fiance and i broke it off
i found him in bed with someone else
oh my gosh
it was another man
shut the front door
motioning for a hug somebody needs a hug
another time then
elizabeth takes an apple from a desk
id never serve a student unwashed fruit
elizabeth takes a huge bite out of the apple
i thought the teachers got the apples
well i think the students teach me at least asmuch as i teach them
elizabeth tosses the mostly uneaten apple into the trash and exits
it hits the rim and lands on the floor
its like an asylum nothing on the walls
elizabeth reads from a stack of us weeklys and circles pictures of celebrity breasts
lynn late s the kind of woman who spends a lot of time on her internet dating profiles but rarely gets emailed pokes her head in
oh sorry am i interrupting
do you want to grab some lunch
im in the middle of something lynn
elizabeth and lynn sit at an outdoor table
lynn picks at a garden salad
elizabeth is eating a bucket of chicken and drinking a large drink
she pulls a bottle of cough syrup from her purse and dumps it into her drink
you have that thing going around huh
are you excited for tomorrow
is tomorrow saturday
no its the first day of school
wait i thought i had a week to get my class together
yeah that was last week
under her breath fuck my ass
if you hate teaching so much why dont you just get another job
and do what
sell perfume at the mall
work at a day care center
slurps her big gulp you know when i first got into teaching i thought i was doing it for all the right reasons short hours summers off no accountability
i love my summers
from now on my full time job will be finding a guy who will take care of me oh god i pray for that and that makes a shit ton
of money and doesnt ask too many questions
licking her fingers i spent most of my summer hanging out at the bars near where the bulls practice
had some fun got some cool souvenirs that i ebayed but those guys arent looking to settle down
and they all wear condoms
and then they take the condoms with them
thats how paranoid they are that a girl will try and get pregnant
like its so easy to get pregnant from a guy nutting into a condom
youre gonna find someone great
ive been thinking about it a lot
i mean i figure im like an
but once i get my new tits ill probably be a
you dont want to do that
youre already so pretty
i know im hot lynn but i dont stand a chance against all those barbies dolls out there
anna nicole had it right may she rest in peace
lynn checks her watch
we should finish up
wallys doing that big orientation for teachers in the auditorium
yeah im not going to that
but its mandatory
im so scared ooohhh
yeah i probably wont go either
i dont know i might
ill probably go but just sit in the back
maybe leave early
maybe stay till the end
play it by ear
or just stay till the end
lynn takes both their trays and dumps them
this was fun
yeah it was alright
when you said you were taking me to lunch i kinda thought it was going to be nicer but this was okay
you can get me next time
not much character not many furnishings
elizabeth is online looking at a porn site
she stares at the screen and compares breasts to the ones in us weekly
she reaches for a bong and pulls a huge hit
the front door opens and her roommate kirk early s boarish and carrying a tattered backpack and a big gulp walks quickly past elizabeth
hey kirk what do you think about me with jessica simpsons tits
he stares at her chest intently
shes not bothered by it
kirk enters his bedroom and slams the door
she glances at the clock am
under her breath fuck my ass
elizabeth is asleep
after a beat the alarm goes off
she checks the clock
first day of school excitement
the bell rings and like rats the kids scurry to their various classes
before long the hallway is empty
in one corner chase clearly at the top of the seventh grade food chain shows off a photo spread of herself modelling in a western style clothing catalogue
garrett wearing grey stained sweatpants and a grey sweatshirt with block letters that read gymnastics stares longingly at chase from a few desks away
the photographer was like sooo nice
he made me feel sooo comfortable
i might get flown to kansas city for their fashion week
chase and her friends turn to face garrett whos as surprised as they are that he spoke
garrett quickly turns away
chase rolls her eyes
an angry looking kid tristan wearing a michael vick jersey turns to garrett
whatd you say to me
elizabeth with large bags under her eyes enters the class
tristan on a dime heads back to his seat
the class immediately quiets down
sasha dressed like a paralegal walks up to elizabeth with a large tupperware tray
hi im sasha
its a pleasure to meet you
handing over tupperware my mother baked these for you
not looking up just leave them on the desk
sasha confused gently puts them down and stands there
after a moment elizabeth looks up
you need something
sasha shakes her head and retreats to her desk at the front of the class
anyone here seen stand and deliver
show of hands
off their blank stares no one
edward james olmos
elizabeth takes a dvd from her bag
she points to two kids in the front of the class
you and you go grab the tv and roll it up front
pointing to sasha and you go shut off the lights
the two kids shawn and spencer roll the tv over
sasha shuts off the lights
were watching a movie on the first day
i think its awesome
i agree with chase
elizabeth pops in the dvd
stand and deliver starring edward james olmos as a tough as nails calculus teacher in an inner city school begins
elizabeth takes a bite of one of sashas cookies and immediately spits it out
she pushes the tupperware tray into the trash next to her desk
sasha looks on sadly
lunch is in full swing
each clique has staked its own territory
several teachers elizabeth and amy among them are on lunch duty
garrett sitting alone writing in a journal
tristan the bully tosses a bowl of cole slaw at garrett
the cole slaw nails him in the shoulder
garrett picks some of the cole slaw off his shirt and eats it
he continues writing
amy races over to tristan and writes him up
elizabeth watches bored struggling to keep her eyes open
amy heads over to elizabeth
somebodys got a case of the sleepies
did you see what just happened
yeah that one kid hit the other kid with the cole slaw
you werent at the orientation the other day but were doing something new this year
its very exciting
were splitting the cafeteria into quadrants
so anyways in order for the quadrant system to work its vital that each teacher maintain order within their quadrant
because its really tough for me as head lunch monitor or another teacher to leave their quadrant to discipline a kid in another quadrant
i know its a lot to take in
id be happy to sit with you after school and explain all of the new guidelines
tell you what
why dont you send me a memo and if i have any questions ill come to you
sounds like a plan stan
oh i meant to ask you
did i hear that you were showing a movie this morning
how do i know what you heard
listen i dont want to tell you how to run your class but maybe it might be fun to do some ice breakers
like telephone charades or the string game
or start doing practice questions for the state test
its never too soon to start
are we gonna have a problem me and you
oh shishkebobs no
if i gave you that impression i am so sorry
actually i was really hoping that we could be more than across the hall mates
i dont know what youve heard but i dont munch box
no of course not
i dont even know what that is
i just meant friends
like getting manicures and going shopping on sundays
shit like that
and helping each other out
looking out for one another
tell you what friend im gonna get going
cover for me
elizabeth doesnt wait for an answer walks off
but you cant leave
lunch doesnt end for another
looks at clock
whos going to watch your quadrant
elizabeth looks around and spots the integrity poster on the wall
she walks over and studies it
elizabeth walks down the hallway with the rolled up poster
passes a man obviously lost looking at a map
this is scott
handsome in a wholesome way
elizabeth walks by as he looks up at her helplessly
she turns on her heels
you look a little lost
can you tell me where room is
ill do you one better
ill take you there
oh you dont have to do that
will you stop
itd be my pleasure
i feel like ive been walking around in circles for the last fifteen minutes
im the new sub
elizabeth halsey th grade language arts
they shake hands a beat too long
elizabeth notices scotts very expensive watch
whats that a jaeger lecoultre
i love mens watches
its kind of a hobby
its a bummer knowing my watch could feed a village for
a year but my grandfather designed it so
your grandfather designs watches
the family business
my moms maiden name is jaeger
my parents had a minor meltdown when i decided to join the peace corps and become a teacher
but theyve been cool about it
elizabeth smiles and they start walking down the hall
pointing to poster
what a great message for the kids
thats why i got it
they turn a corner
garrett wheels his backpack past them
she slaps him five
scott notices smiles
man i cant wait for the day that i have my own classroom
so did you and your wife just move to town
im not married
i was engaged until i walked in on my fiance cheating on me
with his brother
this is me
nice to meet you scott delacourte
hopefully well be seeing a lot of each other
only if a teacher gets sick
great meeting you elizabeth halsey
he heads into the room
elizabeth cocks her head checking out his ass as the door closes
very nice meeting you
a pair of perfect fake breasts
a hand cups them from underneath
pull back to reveal dr
vogel s and his receptionist danni probably in her s with her shirt off
elizabeth watches rapt
as you can see the weight is evenly distributed and theres minimal scarring
holding out his hands best hands in chicago
take them for a spin
elizabeth reaches out squeezes dannis breasts
and the nipples are just
i love them
ill take two
they all laugh
elizabeth notices dr
thats a great watch
and hows that going
shes my rock
alright thanks danni
danni puts her bra and blouse back on and exits
so elizabeth have you given any thought to size
i was thinking you know maybe a d
ijh huh uh huh
i would say though with your frame you might consider something smaller
a large b maybe a c cup
youd be surprised how significant those would look
yeah i think ill go with the ds really turn some heads
you know elizabeth breast enhancements not a cure all
i just want to make sure you have realistic expectations
doctor i lost my fiance to a woman with monster fake tits
so now i need monster fake tits so that i wont lose my next fiance
those are my expectations
is that realistic enough for you
very good then
elizabeth leans over the counter and grabs a mint from a small bowl
danni sits behind her desk wearing a headset
so youll be off your feet for about two weeks
what works for you
lets do december th
start of winter break
the th it is
so the total is for the surgery plus one night stay at our facility
how would you like to pay
what if i dont spend the night at your facility
the nights included in the price
did you not read our literature
a middle aged doctor walks by
flirtatious to doctor hi
then back to danni listen im a teacher not a drug dealer
we accept all major credit cards
my credit situation is complicated
im sorry but if you cant pay i cant schedule the appointment
you know there are less expensive options
have you looked into south america
ill be back
elizabeth dramatically scoops a handful of mints from the bowl and storms out
elizabeth her cell phone cradled to her ear pulls a lean cuisine out of a freezer stocked with them
look i just really need some money
its for a surgery i need
elizabeth pokes holes in the lean cuisine with a knife and turns on the microwave
yes as a matter of fact it is about my breasts dad
happy belated birthday
so can you wire me some money or not
elizabeth walks up a driveway and looks around
on phone whispering so i wont beat around the bush grammy
she pulls the kitchen knife from her bag and slashes the back tire of a late model camry
on phone whispering im dying and i need money for surgery
dont you get social security or something
elizabeth goes around to another tire
elizabeth is still on the phone
close on her computer screen
her checking account balance
into phone losing patience listen limpdick you owe me for breaking off the engagement
do you know how embarrassing that was
lover i dont want to fight
its just dollars and it would really mean the world to me
elizabeth hurls her phone at the wall
kirk pokes his head out of his bedroom
did you call my name
i said fucking troll
oh i thought you said kirk
he turns and heads back in to his room
hey you got ten grand
kirk closes his door
after a beat he opens it
also i might be a little short on the rent this month
like a lot short
he closes his door
the microwave beeps
elizabeth and lynn speak in hushed voices in the corner by a vending machine
amy grades papers on a ratty looking couch
she glances up at elizabeth and lynn
i dont know
thats a lot of money
and i hate asking a friend for money especially as good a friend as you
this has its desired effect on lynn
maybe i could sell that jewelry my grandmother gave me
that turquoise crap
no ones buying that
then catching herself but it looks great on you
what about mark
what type of person do you think i am
that assbag cheated on me
did i ever tell you that he has a mole on the tip of his dick
im just trying to better myself
i dont think thats asking for so much
amy walks over
just gonna scooch in here
she drops quarters into the vending machine but doesnt bother selecting an item
this was clearly her in
she turns to elizabeth and lynn
i know its none of my business but i couldnt help but overhear your conversation and i just want to say that you shouldnt change a thing
you should be happy with the way you are
well do you think mental retards should be happy with the way they are
lynn you teach them
what do you think
ive never asked them
i would never we dont all have your tits squirrel
so maybe you should think before you interrupt a private conversation
i guess thats what you get for trying to help
amy pushes the coin release on the vending machine and takes back her change without getting a drink
amy heads back to the couch
then noticing there he is
all of the female teachers light up
there he is
well look what the cat dragged in
i wish it was under better circumstances
stu rileys car was vandalized last night
right in his driveway
gang members probably
the public school system failed them
elizabeth and amy nod vigorously
an empty hallway
so forget about the way it used to be
this is not a damn democracy
we are in a state of emergency and my word is law
theres only one boss around here and thats me
the class is watching lean on me with morgan freeman as a tough as nails principal in an inner city school
amys integrity poster now hangs above the tv
head nigger in charge
the bell rings
well pick this up again tomorrow
the students shuffle out
garrett hustles after chase
quite a film huh
chase gives him a weird look and then exits with her friends
sasha lingers by elizabeths desk
without looking up what
im a student leader for the d
and were having our car wash this weekend
if youre around maybe we could wash your car
ive got some mexicans who already do it for nothing
its for a good cause
this year were trying to get some extra money so that we can go on a duck tour
she hands elizabeth a flyer
elizabeth glances at it
last years seventh grade raised
elizabeth walks past the school secretary toward the principals office
you cant go in there
hes with a student
elizabeth ignores her adjusts her blouse and enters
the office is decorated with a dolphin motif
figurines a picture of principal snur kissing a dolphin
this guy loves dolphins
principal snur sits next to arkady a small pale kid
if you dont like to get wet arkady you could try using deodorant anti
perspirant maybe some cologne
i know a lot of the older boys are wearing the body spray
elizabeth enters and immediately recoils from the smell
arkady and principal snur both look up
he holds up his finger one minute
elizabeth notices his cheap dolphin watch
so why dont you think about that and ill let your teachers know that youre working on it
arkady nods and quickly exits
sorry i didnt realize you were in with anyone
we were just finishing up
elizabeth i actually meant to talk to you
did i hear that you were showing movies all last week
some clips maybe
i think in a lot of ways movies are the new books
elizabeth tries a different tact
she picks up a dolphin shaped clock from the desk
is this new
i love it
i think dolphins are smarter than humans
and if you like that youll love this
principal snur pulls out an adopt a dolphin certificate
he lives in the cayman islands
what a great story
principal snur visibly relaxes
hes sitting across from a kindred spirit
so what else is new
actually i was thinking that i want to get more involved
what a nice surprise
specifically i thought i could supervise the car wash
amys been running it the last two years
she just does so much
it might be nice to give her a little rest
especially that early on a saturday
im so happy that youre dedicating yourself and becoming a real member of the jams family
it just feels so good to help
amy stands in the door where elizabeth was just standing
principal snur is behind his desk
for the seventh grade carwash
amy immediately regrets saying bonkers
i didnt mean to blow my stack
i just thought it was nice to see some other teachers step up
we raised over last year
thats a record
is this really the best time to start experimenting
amy i see you taking on a
lot of responsibility what with directing annie and all your work with d
id just hate to see you get overwhelmed like you did in
she stares at him clearly this is a touchy subject
well i should skedaddle
looks like someone needs to plan a saturday morning bike ride
she turns on her heels and walks out
elizabeth is asleep
her alarm goes off
she opens her eyes sees the time considers for a beat then hits snooze
she closes her eyes
after a beat the alarm goes off again
she hits snooze
elizabeth hits the snooze button every nine minutes until
she stares at the clock
garrett stands at the school entrance holding a giant cardboard sign that reads car wash as a few cars pull in
chase and the other popular girls are dressed in seventh grade sexy theyve tied off their shirts
the boys run around spraying each other but mostly spraying garrett
garrett laughs mistakenly thinking that hes part of the fun
oh im gonna get you guys
a couple of parent chaperones stand in small clusters
tristan the bully cocks his arm and aims a soapy sponge at garrett
the camera follows tristans gaze
elizabeth steps out of her car
shes wearing high heels daisy dukes and a bikini top
she looks both spectacular and ridiculous
a couple of parents look over at elizabeth in shock
calling to parents sorry im late
to other parents im going to say something about her outfit
the mothers vigorously nod in agreement
a dad pipes in
staring hard at elizabeth well if it helps raise money
the other dads vigorously nod in agreement
elizabeth holds the carwash sign
a line of cars forms
an older man in an immaculately clean cadillac rolls down his window and hands her money
elizabeth washes in slo mo shakes out her hair as she gets wet
the boys and their fathers stare at her
the girls try to mimic elizabeths seductive behavior
their mothers run over and pull them away
the older man in the cadillac comes back to have his car re washed
the carwash is wrapping up
elizabeth counts money at a makeshift table and puts the earnings into a metal lockbox
she glances around and then shoves a large clump of cash into her daisy dukes
what are you doing
elizabeth looks up and sees sasha hiding behind a truck clearly spying
get out of here dummy
are you stealing our money
how dare you
im here early on a saturday for you guys
and for the record nobody likes a tattle tale
i havent tattled
cause if you do ill deny it and flunk your ass
how will that look on your resume
i didnt say i would say anything
now beat it
ive gotta finish counting this money
sasha walks off
elizabeth picks up a hose and sprays her
see you monday
elizabeth waves to sashas mother who eagerly waves back
any across the street watching through binoculars
shes straddling her bike and is wearing a helmet and a sheen of recently applied suntan lotion
she takes a sip from her camelbak and pedals away
close on a fish bowl with a crude sign that reads new tits
elizabeth drops in fistfuls of crumpled cash and then writes in a notebook
amy walks down the hall
she sees principal snur slip into the bathroom
amy walks up to the mens faculty bathroom door and waits
the bell rings
she hesitates a beat and then enters
wally is in a stall reading a brochure for a dolphin tour
are you in here
its amy squirrel
he instinctively covers himself with the brochure
what are you doing
amy standing inside
she scrunches her nose at the smell
thisll just take a sec
i thought you might want to know that elizabeth halsey showed up at the carwash in a bikini top and short shorts
it was pretty racy stuff
can we talk about this later
quoting some adage later well all die said the gator to the fly
another teacher walks past amy looking confused
he hesitates and then goes into an adjoining stall
look josh gershmans dad called and said that the carwash was a huge success
and lauren rissmans dad called and said the kids had a great time
i dont want to speak out of school but i happened to be pedalling by and saw her get
pretty chummy with the money
and remember we barely know anything about her
she was a real lone wolf last year
are you accusing elizabeth of embezzling from the seventh grade car wash
something about this doesnt pass the smell test wally
well they raised over so whatever she did worked
and next time you accuse a fellow teacher of stealing you better be damn sure
were done here
amy takes a deep breath
her face is beet red
thanks for the pep talk
have a super day you two
immediately there is an immense eruption from the other stall followed by a sigh
i thought she was never going to leave
sandy the math teacher with the ponytail sits at the table grading papers
another teacher dozes in the corner
entering very friendly hey
are those new doc martens
sandy looks behind him at the dozing teacher
is she talking to me
great thanks for asking
we got a new bassist and we finally got a regular gig which is nice because its earned
its time to show the world that a bunch of teachers can really rock out
hey would you mind grabbing me my yogurt from the fridge
sandy goes to the fridge
elizabeth pulls visine from her bag and as his head goes into the fridge she squirts the entire container into his coffee mug
you should come to one of our shows
he hands her the yogurt
oh i cant
sandy sadly takes a sip of his coffee
i didnt even tell you the dates
elizabeths class is seated
theyre staring at her waiting for her to begin
are we starting school ties today
elizabeth holds up her finger while she finishes reading a
the camera angles to show that she is studying a picture of a topless african tribeswoman with large breasts
after a beat elizabeth looks up
alright today were starting school ties
then pointing to a student you shut off the lights
elizabeth goes to the dvd player
theres a knock at the door and the school secretary walks in holding a box
she hands it to a confused elizabeth
here it is
here what is
its the pre test for the state standardized test
it was in the memo
in the memo
the secretary leaves
elizabeth stares at the box
a couple kids start making farting noises with their hands
zip your shit
alright look we all know these tests are gay elizabeth turns to a student who could be gay
elizabeth passes the box to the front of the class where the kids dutifully take scan trons and test booklets
then reading according to this memo im supposed to give you forty five minutes per section
blah blah blah
clear your desks pencils out and begin
twenty five pencils hit paper in unison
elizabeth takes the tv and swivels it to face her desk
she turns on the movie turns down the volume just a little bit and reclines
chase and another popular girl strut across the cafeteria arm in arm
a third popular girl saving a table waves them over
chase and her friend walk right past the girl like she doesnt exist and take a seat with a bunch of other girls
elizabeth and lynn on lunch duty
the girl at the table starts bawling
amy also on duty races over to console her
what a phony
but she also cares a lot too
so whats going on with your boobs
shit is going on with my boobs
im never gonna get married
im gonna die broke
i should just blow my brains out
then lighting up there he is
scott walks down the ramp and high fives a bunch of kids
he gives them a big wave
i love how his eyes sparkle when he smiles
i want to sit on his face
youre really making a habit out of this
actually sandy pinkus in the math department i guess he got that stomach bug thats been going around and i got the call
i heard he pooped himself in first period
a kid had to walk him to the nurse
lynn would you mind grabbing me a milk
elizabeth gives her a can you get out of here
scott do you want anything
im good thanks for asking
lynn walks off
so scott lynn comes back
sorry what kind of milk do you want
i dont know
okay ill get you skim
lynn walks off again
elizabeth notices amy looking at her as she continues to console the girl
elizabeth turns back to scott
so scott i was thinking i would love to hear about your experiences in the peace corps
i love haiti
maybe we could go grab a drink some night
isnt it back to school night
news to her yeah silly i meant after
lets get a group together
or just the two of us
scott looks around then lowers his voice
um listen im really flattered
youre one of the nicest people ive met here
im actually seeing someone
yeah weve been keeping it quiet
because shes ugly
she really cares about the kids
when youre dating a co worker
elizabeth whips around to see amy whos now sharing a frozen yogurt with the formerly bawling girl
amy looks up smiles and gives a thumbs up to elizabeth and scott signalling that everythings okay with the girl
elizabeth notices amys large breasts straining against her blouse
she quietly seethes
anyways thanks again for asking me out
and ill take a raincheck on that group date
scott crosses through the cafeteria
lynn returns with a four cartons of milk
here you go
i got you one of each
lynn hands them to elizabeth who takes them drops them in the trash and storms off
at night under the stars the school looks peaceful serene
elizabeth is up front
shes staring at the parents
they stare right back at her
its awkwardly silent for a beat too long
hi my names elizabeth halsey
sashas mother eagerly raises her hand
elizabeth points to her
hi im sashas mother
we waved to each other at the carwash
im a little concerned with the importance youre placing on movies
what about the state test
elizabeth points to her sign on the wall dont question my authority
thats exactly what i say to my students
listen im a good teacher
and the school hired me because im good at what i do
as the parents take this in and the reason your son loves my class is because i inspire him
movies are one tool that i use
i also use other multimedia techniques which im not going to get into right now
look i could take you day by day through my entire syllabus but thats not how i do things
im not one of these stuffy teachers whos totally by the book
i talk to the kids like theyre little adults
its about mutual respect
so thats my spiel as the jews say
help yourselves to some delicious snacks and drinks in the back
they head to the back of the class
angle on a refreshments table
a lonely package of oreos rests against a pitcher of tap water
elizabeth tries to sneak out the door but is stopped by a sharply dressed parent
excuse me ms
im chris dad
from elizabeths reaction she clearly has no idea who chris is
great kid and precocious
you must be so proud
oh what a relief
i just wish his grades would reflect it
if i know chris hell get there
listen i know you have a full plate but if you could keep an eye on chris my wife and i would really appreciate it
chris dad shakes her hand
elizabeth opens her hand sees a tightly folded hundred dollar bill
she looks back up at chris dad
elizabeth stands with another set of parents
theyre eating oreos and sipping water
youre chases parents
great kid and precocious
you must be so proud
the parents beam
a student like that would benefit so much from some extra attention
you think we should hire a tutor
then to chases dad i told you
id be happy to do it myself
its just hard in a class of twenty five
oh to be a teacher
its just so hard on my salary having to pay for my supplies my fiance cheated on me with his twin sister
and unlike a lot of these other teachers all i truly care about is helping your child learn
and as their personal tutor i guarantee a full grade higher or your money back
chases mom takes out her check book
make it out to cash
parents are leaving the class ad libbing thank
another set of parents surreptitiously hand elizabeth some cash
a bohemian mother melody wearing a beret lingers behind
excuse me ms
i just wanted to introduce myself
nice to meet you
garretts a great kid and precocious
you must be so proud
oh youre referring to his poetry
you must be so proud
so so so so so proud
a kid like that if i could just give some more one on one time he would just blossom
im so happy to hear you say that
would really benefit from that
unfortunately in a class of twenty five
class sizes are ridiculous
and with the amount they pay teachers
thank god you love what you do
i guess what im getting at is maybe you could help out by giving me a little you know somethin somethin
elizabeth offers her hand palm up
melody stares back at her blankly
its just its really tough to teach the way that i want to teach when theres so little money
i mean look at this place
you know what im going to do for you
melody opens her pocketbook
i am going to start a letter writing campaign to the school board to my congressman to the mayor and keep writing until you get what you deserve
she opens her date book and writes herself a note
and im writing myself a reminder
melody pulls elizabeth into a warm hug
you are a saint
elizabeth is left in the classroom by herself
so long crazy
as elizabeth pulls out the cash she just made we hear the opening beats of coolios gangsters paradise
the song continues
elizabeth pokes her head in
the office is empty
she walks in grabs the lost and found box and exits
the song continues
elizabeth stands across from a hippie looking girl
the pile of lost and found clothes are laid out on the counter
the hippie girl hands elizabeth some cash
the song continues as elizabeth throws more money in her new tits jar and enters a new amount into her notebook
the new balance
gangsters paradise continues and we see that the class is now watching dangerous minds with michelle pfeiffer as a tough as nails teacher in an inner city school
the song continues as amy in her empty classroom stands against the adjoining wall her ear pressed to it
the song continues
the class is still watching dangerous minds
theres some noise in the hall
elizabeth pauses the movie stopping the song
she leans into the hall
enough with the commotion
the hallway goes silent
she comes back in and unpauses the movie
the song comes back on
the song continues as the hallway fills with excited kids who race down the hall and talk animatedly with friends
elizabeth pushes through the center
the song continues
elizabeth sits in her car
she lights a joint with the cigarette lighter and deeply inhales
the song abruptly ends
she turns to her window sees sasha bundled in her winter coat waving
through the window what do you want
sasha motions for her to roll down the window
is that marijuana
but its medicinal
doctor gave it to me
not that its any of your business
my mom and i made you holiday cookies
sasha pulls out a tupperware container
peering through window are those oatmeal raisin
elizabeth considers then manually rolls down the window a crack
she grabs the container and quickly closes her window
elizabeth starts eating a cookie
you have anything to drink
sasha shakes her head
word to the wise stop dressing like youre running for congress
i dont want to run for congress
i want to be president
thats what im talking about
keep saying stuff like that youre gonna get punched
you really want to be president or is that what your parents tell to be
you dont have to decide right now
maybe you wake up one day and decide that you love giving massages and you want to be a masseuse
salary plus tips
think about it
if i think about it will i get extra credit
shakes her head hopeless
watch your feet
sasha jumps away from the car
elizabeth peels out passing the school marquee that reads happy holidays jammers
see you in
elizabeth rolls over
she yawns and gets out of bed
elizabeth opens her refrigerator
nothing except ketchup packets mustard packets and soy sauce packets
she reaches for her bong and tries lighting it
she shakes the lighter
she carries the bong to the stove turns on the stove and tries lighting it from there
elizabeth walks up to the door
she shakes the door
she sees a homeless guy leaning against the storefront
whys the store closed
the homeless guy looks at her strangely
elizabeth looks around
the streets are empty
not a person in sight
then stops hey you got a lighter
i dont smoke
its bad for you
elizabeth walks back to her car empty handed
a mini van passes
the window rolls down
its garrett and his mom
hey its me garrett
merry christmas ms
having a nice christmas
what are you doing the rest of the day
going to see your family
im probably going to meet up with some people
were having a big potluck so
elizabeth shuffles her feet
then extremely maternal elizabeth
would you like to have christmas with us
cozy and unpretentious
filled with crafts
elizabeth sits next to melody and across from garrett whos wearing his gymnastics sweatshirt and his two aunts both divorced
elizabeth tears through a plate of christmas cuisine
this is a real treat for garrett
he doesnt have a lot of friends come by the house
i find that hard to believe
listen i hate to eat and run but ive gotta head over to the shelter
i thought we could play board games
that is so inspiring
yeah i love helping bums
oh but you have to wait for dessert
we have a real treat
if its cheesecake ill stay
its even better than cheesecake
garrett why dont you run and get some of your new poetry
embarrassment oh god no one wants to hear it
oh god im so embarrassed
dont be shy marbles
garrett runs out of the room
if youre not really serving dessert im gonna have to get going
if you like it maybe you can read it to your homeless friends
garrett stands in front of elizabeth and his family
he opens his journal clears his throat and begins
this is called the chase by garrett tiara
xoxo my love for you is xoxo her hair is long and straight isnt it great
about her smile that i would walk a mile for about her personality that makes me see the best in me and at night when we sleep our souls locked
in deep so that when we sleep we can stop pretending and embrace our beautiful ending
the aunts join in
elizabeth claps then gets up to go
garrett shakes them all off
she sits back down
well dance our dance well revel in romance perchance one glance one dance because together we can achieve
really reaching for it ba lance
he closes his journal
melody looks to elizabeth for a reaction
junior likes to rhyme
patty nancy why dont you give me a hand with dessert give them a chance to talk about the poem
the women exit leaving garrett and elizabeth
so your poems about that girl
you got the subtext
can i give you some advice
number one stop writing poetry
two stop reading it
and three dont set your sights so high
i mean shes really hot
if i were you id try for that chubby girl that sits up front the one with the teeth
elizabeth puts her hands to show teeth going off in different directions
but i like chase
not gonna happen
look i was that hot girl
and i never would have gone out with a kid like you
and im not saying that to be mean
im saying it to be helpful
what do you know
you dont even know our names
ill tell you what i know a kid who wears the same gymnastics sweatshirt three days a week isnt getting laid until hes
thats what i know
this sweatshirt was my dads
its all he left when he left
well theres a reason he didnt pack it
quiet steely fuck you
elizabeth pats garrett on the shoulder
good luck being a loser
thank your mom for dinner
elizabeth heads for the door
happy new year
are you spending that alone too or do you want my mom to invite you over
she gives him the finger over her shoulder and leaves
the students many tanned many with braids in their hair from their winter vacations silently stare at elizabeth
she looks haggard
she pulls out a bottle of cough syrup and takes a long swig
the kids look at each other like what is she doing
elizabeth lets out a lame fake cough
elizabeth is checking her makeup in the mirror
her blouse has a healthy serving of vomit on it
hey welcome back
what is that vomit
lynn grabs some towels and blots at the stain
yeah and a little blood
the kids had too much sugar
anyways a bunch of us are going out tonight to see period play
do you want to come
elizabeth heads out
lynn still blotting follows her
elizabeth and lynn bump into scott
are you coming to in cahoots tonight
my bands doing a few songs
could be fun
that sounds like a party
then to lynn lynn do you want to come
well all grab a drink
i need to get drunk
i mean not drunk drunk
but a strong buzz
still be able to drive home
high fives her now were cooking with grease
we hear the familiar riff of shawn mullins lullaby
scott sandy with his hair down a balding bass player with a yarmulke and a heavy set drummer are playing their hearts out
this is period
amy and a couple other teachers are front and center grooving to the music
amy sways with her eyes closed
everythings gonna be alright rockabye
scott joins in harmonizing
elizabeth and lynn at the bar
arent they terrific
elizabeth eye fucks scott
she catches his eye and he quickly smiles before nervously turning his attention to amy
elizabeth watches amy dance in slo m her breasts bouncing up and down
staring at amys breasts theyre perfect
you should hear some of their originals
she turns to the bartender
then to lynn you want anything
you know i was thinking that if you still need that money you should
try and go for the bonus
for the state test
off elizabeths look
whichever teacher has the highest scoring class gets a bonus
we talk about it all the time in the faculty meetings
could be good right
lynn runs out onto the dance floor and joins amy
man its a hot one like seven inches from the midday sun
amy kicks her shoes off and starts dancing
lynn follows suit
elizabeth throws back her drink and exits
the sun is breaking
amy listens to npr as she pulls into the empty parking lot
suddenly she slams on her brakes
elizabeths car is already there
amy puts her car in park and gets out
she walks over to elizabeths car and feels the hood
the clicking of amys shoes echo through the empty hallway
she stops takes off her shoes
she pitter patters down the hall to elizabeths classroom and peers in
elizabeth is at the chalkboard intently writing questions
she senses something in her periphery and looks over at her window
elizabeth goes back to work
elizabeth waits in the doorway impatiently as the kids filter in
garrett brings up the rear rolling his backpack into class
lets go sylvia plath
garrett rolls his backpack over elizabeths shoe
elizabeth winces and glares at garrett
the rest of the class enters stops noticing work packets on each of their desks
wheres the tv
everyone take your seats
shawn turns to spencer
what do you thinks going on
come on come on
we have a lot to cover so sit down
the class still confused quickly take their seats
open your tokill a mockingbird to page one
the kids slowly take out their books
we hear the distinct sound of twenty five book spines cracking as theyre opened for the first time
checking her notes good
now who can tell me why jem cries when the hole in the tree is filled with cement
because shes a cry baby
the kids chuckle
chase looks back at garrett
garrett clicks up the handle on his bag and heads for the door
were here to learn
anyone else have a problem with that
so who has the answer to my question
everyone looks down
nobodys read this book
its on the syllabus
raising hand and answering you never assigned it to us
well now i am
and were having a quiz tomorrow
on the first hundred pages
you cant do that
i have band and jazz band tonight
we havent had homework all year
zip your shit
weve fallen behind and honestly your practice tests scores sucked balls which was embarrassing to me both on a personal level and as an educator
things are about to change
recess is over
elizabeth reads to kill a mockingbird and highlights like crazy
she stops takes a hit from her bong and continues
her roommate kirk enters through the front door sipping from a big gulp
did you get my cool ranch
he tosses her a bag of chips
you owe me two bucks
kirk walks into his room and closes the door
she has a book of stickers in her hand
okay now what is the significance of the mockingbird in the novel
what was harper lee trying to tell us
no one raises their hand
come on you guys know this
this is as close to real teaching as weve seen from elizabeth
sasha raises her hand
we see that she already has two gold star stickers on her forehead
rolls her eyes anyone else
chase raises her hand
its a symbol for um equality
elizabeth puts a sticker on chases forehead
can anyone add to what that girl said
the desks have been arranged into a makeshift courtroom
spencer presides as the judge
chase and shawn are the prosecutors
garrett is dressed like boo radley
tristan the bully addresses the rest of the class the jury
everyone is clearly into the exercise
reveal principal snur clad in a dolphin tie watching from the back of the class
ladies and gentlemen of the jury youve heard the facts but come on you know me
im atticus finch baby
the class laughs
come on seriously
youre gonna side with chase and shawn over me
use examples from the book
it doesnt matter what race the defendant is
youve just gotta look at the facts
elizabeth nods in agreement
the bell rings
good work today
and dont forget to leave your closing statements on my desk
the students all dutifully drop off their papers placing them in a neat stack next to other ungraded papers
principal snur exits giving elizabeth a thumbs up
love the tie
scott and amy share a bag of trail mix
sandy reads a jerry garcia biography
so you know how i hate to gossip but i heard that one of the custodians walked in on omar you know that arabic boy giving
oral sex to matty feldstein after swim practice in the boys locker room
it just starts younger and younger
its nice to finally see the jews and the arabs getting along
scott looks up and smiles
your shirts mis buttoned
her shirts mis buttoned
elizabeth turns away from them and starts rebuttoning
sandy tries to sneak a peek
scott shoots him a dirty look
sandy gives an innocent shrug
grabs yogurt from fridge ive just been such a mess the last few days
working myself to the bone
yeah its been quite a change
well i think its great
some teachers just sail by doing the bare minimum
its good to know there are still some actual educators out there
elizabeth smiles for scott like you get me
well i should get going
nice seeing all of you
amy and elizabeth smile thinly at one another
elizabeth squeezes scotts shoulder as she exits
what a good egg
amy and sasha sit in the empty auditorium
sasha is dressed as little orphan annie including the red wig
student stagehands construct a set
what else sasha
i dont know
i told you about the car wash money
i cant prove that
i think ive told you everything
and no more movies in class
no were actually learning
did you know that animal farm isnt even really about animals animal farm
thats not even on the syllabus
then collecting herself i know youre forgetting something
do you want extra credit on your diorama or not
i want it
let me think
oh there was
it was okay
it was medicinal
hold your horses
what was medicinal
halsey was smoking in her car but she told me her doctor prescribed it
two scary looking german shepherds their teeth bared pull two police officers down the hall
to german shepherd coaxing come on axel what do you smell boy
the police officers continue the search
they lead the dogs up against lockers and knock on class doors
amy and principal snur watch from the end of the hallway
you better be right about this or im going to be getting a lot of panicked calls from parents
trust me wally
my kids in d
tell me everything and there are drugs in this school
and not just the students
some of the female teachers
the class is split up into mini sections of four desks each
the students are quietly and dutifully working
as elizabeth reads papers and grades them we hear the various students voices
atticus finch is a good lawer because hes a good person whose a layer
elizabeth looks at tristan
as she writes we hear proofread
elizabeth grades another paper
shes growing more agitated and is now feverishly writing
is this english
are you fucking kidding me
elizabeth crosses out with one line so its clearly visible beneath
from out in the hallway we hear the loud aggressive barking of the dogs
tristan runs to the door and peeks out
elizabeth races to the window
the police officers and the dogs enter the classroom next to hers
elizabeth glances back at her pocketbook
under her breath balls
she races back to her desk
elizabeth takes her seat and leans under her desk obscuring her from her class
she opens her pocketbook and pulls out a cigarette case
she pops it open and we see three neatly rolled joints
without hesitation elizabeth pops the first one into her mouth and starts chewing vigorously
makes her way through the second and then the third the chewing becomes slower and the barking becomes louder and louder
elizabeth starts choking as the door opens and the police officer and the german shepherd enter followed by principal snur and amy
elizabeth sorry to bother you
this will only take a second
still choking digs into her purse
she grabs her cough syrup and takes a huge swig
elizabeth wipes her mouth breathes normally
i had something caught in my throat
the german shepherd continues barking
what is it axel
where is it boy
the dog comes bounding at elizabeth
elizabeths eyes go wide
amy licks her lips
the dog sideswipes elizabeth almost knocking her over and jumps onto garrett
thepolice officer starts rummaging through garretts bag and pulls out an opened bag of corn chips
holding up corn chips all clear
dog mustve responded to these
elizabeth glares at amy i know you were behind this
amy glares back
principal snur looks at amy and shakes his head
grasping at straws to garrett even though that wasnt drugs junk food is still contraband
thats detention buster
i think its time we call off this witch hunt
pointedly to amy thank you principal snur
now if youll excuse me my class has a state test to prepare for
principal snur amy and the police officer exit
elizabeth slumps down into her chair and all at once the combination of weed and cough syrup hits her
are you okay ms
elizabeth takes a long beat before answering
but the bell didnt ring
get out of my face
then to garrett and leave the corn chips
the class uncertainly gathers their things and heads out
from outside elizabeths window we see the school busses idling curbside
elizabeth stares at the papers she still needs to grade
the papers stare back at her
to no one but first a nap
elizabeth is asleep at her desk
she wakes with a jolt
a paper is stuck to her face
she looks again at the stack of work then at the pile of things shes already corrected
she knocks the stack of ungraded papers to the ground
after a beat she collects herself goes to pick the papers off the floor
as she starts tossing them into the trash something catches her eye a practice test manual
and in the corner an address peoria il huh
elizabeth tears off the corner and pockets it
hey its elizabeth halsey
elizabeth is driving down the highway and smoking a joint
unfortunately i cant make it in today
my grandmother took a turn for the worse and it looks like shes dead
the kids are laughing and engaged
turn to reveal scott dressed in overalls and a straw hat with a piece of hay in his mouth animatedly teaching
hes holding a copy of the adventures of tom sawyer
so im off to the funeral
wish me luck
elizabeth knocks on the door
a buff shirtless guy in a backwards hat opens it
he likes what he sees
is tucker here
yeah hold on
then back to elizabeth so you coming to our ceos and corporate hos party tonight
elizabeth just stares at the frat guy
he turns away
tucker dressed identically to the frat guy but twenty pounds overweight hustles down the stairs
he has a tattoo of intertwined teabags around his bicep
tucker sits on his bed
elizabeth leans against a desk unwilling to sit down on anything in his disgusting room
bob marley plays softly
do you ever talk to my brother
he dumped me remember
you and my brother always had the histrionics
so do you want to come to our party tonight
ceos and corporate hos
were kinda light on hos
like i told frat guy im not interested

it helps build mass okay
why do you even want it
i have money and im in a rush
she takes out a wad of cash
thats all you needed to say
no need to get all histrionic on me
tucker walks over to a chest opens it and takes out a small lockbox
he unlocks it and takes out a small bottle containing a clear liquid
one capful makes you feel really good
two capfuls will knock her out for a couple hours
you dont want to take any more than two
elizabeth hands him some cash
he hands her the jar and then gives her a big warm hug
listen i know you and my brother arent together anymore but i still think of you as a sister okay
get your hand off my ass
sorry didnt even know i put it down there
good luck with your lifting
as elizabeth drives we hear a phone ringing
how can i direct your call
hi my name is marjorie goodman and im calling from the chicago tribune
who could i speak to regarding allegations of racial bias on your standardized tests
a portly unkempt man in a cheap suit carl halabi nervously walks through the hotel bar
he sees the back of a woman with a red perm
marjorie turns and we see that its actually elizabeth wearing the little orphan annie wig
shes sipping a cocktail
you must be carl
his face lights up excited to be in the company of such an attractive woman
elizabeth stands and extends her hand
carl notices elizabeths very short skirt
thanks for meeting me on such short notice
elizabeth motions for him to sit down
you find the place alright
i love downstate illinois
first time to peoria
a lot of people dont know this but its the largest city on the illinois river
i did not know that
and it was actually founded before chicago
have you ever auditioned
enjoying the compliment no
i should i should
definitely thought about it
listen id love to sit here and chat with you all night
but im sure youre a very busy man so ill get right down to it
ive spoken to various um black citizens who are alleging that your tests are biased towards white people and orientals
shakes head in frustration you cant use my name okay
like i told you on the phone every couple of years we get calls from all over the state with these cockamamie charges
you should hear what they call me
and im not a racist
i voted for obama
motioning for her to write that you can quote me on
elizabeth takes out a notebook and pen and starts jotting down notes
look marjorie i know my tests arent perfect
but whats the alternative
im all for free thinking and creativity but how do you formulate an education budget without hard numbers from one of my tests
you dont need to convince me
but you know what would help carl
for me to see one of this years tests
no problem at all
elizabeth lights up
ill send you one the day after the schools administer them
id really love to see it sooner
im on a bit of a deadline
i wish i could but unfortunately you need one of these bad boys
carl holds up a lanyard with a state id card and some keys attached
ooh you look like youre cia
listen i totally get it
enough business for one night
im gonna have another drink before i hit the road
whats your poison
my poison is the white devil
then to bartender one white wine one tequila sunrise and two shots of tequila
carl is a little tipsy and slurring his words
elizabeth seems to be fine
you know marjorie this is the best night ive had in a longtime
well that makes two of us
elizabeth gives carl fuck me eyes
he nervously sips his drink
what turns you on carl
you know what turns me on carl
he giggles nervously
sex in an office
getting fucked really really hard against a wooden desk
carl flips on the fluorescent lights and they flicker on like dominoes across the ceiling
they enter his office and carl awkwardly leans against the metal desk
gesturing as promised so this is the desk
do you have anything to drink
carl goes to a mini fridge and pulls out an already opened bottle of white wine
white wine in the office
youre a bad boy
carl pours a glass
elizabeth swigs from the bottle
do you have any music
i could put on some internet radio
carl goes to fiddle with his computer
elizabeth quickly reaches into her purse and pulls out the bottle of ghb
she pours a little into carls wine
and then a little bit more
as he turns around she hands him the glass
to new friends
to new lovers
carl downs his glass
im gonna take off my shoes
is that okay
im gonna hit the ladys room
k first door on your right
dont be long
carl starts carefully clearing everything off of his desk
elizabeth waits in the bathroom
checks her watch
she walks back in
carl looks woozy
the only thing keeping him from passing out is the prospect of seeing elizabeth naked
i wanna fug ya agains dis desk
carl stumbles towards her
elizabeth deftly moves around the desk and exits into the bullpen
as to a child carl im gonna need you to pass the fuck out
carl smiles as he feebly chases after her
stops at the photocopier steadies himself momentarily and then passes out still standing
elizabeth grabs the lanyard from carls neck and heads back into his office
she goes over to the filing cabinets unlocks it with one of the keys and starts rifling
she pulls out a folder
and bingo was his name o
she walks over to the photocopier and pushes carl over
he collapses on the ground out cold
she copies the test and puts it back and grabs a stack of scantrons from a shelf
she takes a post it scribbles something and sticks it to his forehead
as elizabeth exits the camera pushes in you were amazing
elizabeth stares at the clock
the students open their test books and start
twenty five pencils hit paper in unison
elizabeth stares at the clock
okay pencils down
a couple of groans
a couple of frantic moves to fill in more scantron bubbles
come on come on
it doesnt even matter
bring your tests up
the students dutifully place their tests into a neat stack on the corner of elizabeths desk and exit
elizabeth waits for all the kids to leave and then slides all of the exams into the trash
she pulls out a match and lights the exams on fire
she then reaches into her bag and pulls out a new stack of completed exams
she places the new exams into an official looking folder and exits
principal snur is on stage
all the teachers sit in the first few rows
amy stands at her seat
if anyone has any information regarding the whereabouts of the missing annie wig please let me know asap
because if that wig isnt found you can bet your bottom dollar the sun will not come out tomorrow
back to you wally
principal snur addresses the teachers
um okay im sure everyone wants to go home so ill be quick
fourscore and seven years ago
elizabeth rolls her eyes
holding up file so i have here the results of the state exam and im happy to announce that john adams middle school had the fifth highest scores in the
the teachers applaud
and i want to single out one of our own who showed that with hard work and dedication one person can make a difference
she makes me proud to be her boss and shes now richer
with the highest scores in the county yes you heard me right in the county i want everyone to please give a hand to to random teacher oh boy third
year in a row
this is starting to get embarrassing
elizabeth leans over to amy whos sitting beside her
this is unexpected
all of the color drains from amys face as elizabeth stands and waves at the crowd
teachers are exiting the auditorium
scott catches up to elizabeth whos marvelling at the bonus check
hey if it isnt professor smartypants
scott playfully punches her shoulder
elizabeth playfully punches him back

danni the receptionist uncrumples a ball of crumpled cash and counts it
elizabeth taps her fingers impatiently

elizabeth slides four credit cards across the desk
the middle aged doctor from earlier walks by

elizabeth turns back to danni

elizabeth pulls her shirt away from her body and looks down at her breasts
so long suckers
the lot is empty except for elizabeths car
elizabeth enters and pulls latex gloves from her bag
she snaps them on
she takes a seat at amys desk and pulls an apple from her bag
then she pulls out poison ivy
she rubs the apple with the poison ivy leaves and then carefully places it in the center of the desk
amys class is seated
amy enters and heads for her desk
she notices the apple and smiles at her class touched
the class stares back at her blankly
who did this
no response from the class
oh come on
nobody wants an extra sticker on their all star board
amy presses the apple to her ear
muppet voice to apple who brought you to me
amy places the apple up to her ear

amy takes a bite of the apple and then addresses the class

amy watching from outside her car
one side of her face is completely blistered scaly and red from the poison ivy
the kids have every reason to be scared by her
she gets into her car and slams the door
banging on steering wheel fudge
kids sing bus songs
elizabeth and scott sit up front

chase rolls her eyes
up front scott and elizabeth sit next to one another and share ipod buds

scott smiles wide
garrett walks up the aisle

garrett gives her an annoyed look and then heads back to his seat
scott smiles at elizabeth
wow you are such a natural
when you love what you do it comes easy
a splotchy faced amy trudges down the hallway
she passes elizabeths room stops walks back to the door and peers in
she looks down the hallway its empty
amy rifles through elizabeths desk
she opens the top drawer
just pens and paper
she tries the bottom drawer
amy drags elizabeths desk across the hallway into her room
its a slow difficult and loud process
amy sweating now drags her own desk across the
hallway into elizabeths room
she stops to catch her breath
amy watches as the maintenance guy sorts through his keys and tries to unlocks the desk
nervous too loud i never lose my keys
whats wrong with your face
whats wrong with your face
just making conversation
he finds the right key and opens the desk
buying it back super
thanks a bunch amos
the maintenance man exits
amy immediately opens the desk and rummages through it
she pulls out the annie wig
she pulls out a test booklet
theres a piece ripped out from the front page
amys eyes narrow
she runs to the floor where she has neat stacks of what used to be in her desk
she finds her test booklet and compares the two clocking the i
looks like somebodys in big big trouble
elizabeth and scott stand with the kids in the lobby area
alright guys count off
the students begin their count off
he bumps knuckles with his friend
as the students continue counting off we d
montage elizabeth and scott walk with the kids through arlington national cemetery
elizabeth snaps her gum
elizabeth scott and the kids follow a tour guide through the white house
elizabeth takes the gum from her mouth and looks for a place to toss it
she doesnt see a trash can and quickly sticks it to the bottom of an antique table
chase has elizabeth take a charlies angels posed picture of her and her minions
elizabeth takes the picture before theyre fully posed and hands the camera back
amy her face still covered in the rash sits across from carl halabi the administrator that elizabeth roofied
carl is staring at a photo of elizabeth
she changed her hair
is marjorie in some kind of trouble
i think youre the one that might be in some kind of trouble
did you or did you not give her a copy of the state test
all i did was give her a couple of quotes for her article and thats it
for the tribune
shes a reporter there
amys eyes go wide
amys car zooms past the camera
amys drives her hands at and
close on the speedometer as the needle hovers between and mph
the students take pictures
garrett walks up to chase
hey you want me to take your picture
alright well let me know
ive got my camera and my batterys fully charged
she turns away
scott who stares up at the memorial and looks choked up
elizabeth walks up behind him eating a fruit roll up
fruit roll up
im so conflicted about this man
did you know that he had slaves
elizabeth tries to dislodge a piece of the fruit roll up from the back of her mouth with her tongue
yeah everyone knows that
i just hate slavery so so much
an unquestionable evil
i hate it
elizabeth continues struggling with the fruit
slaverys the worst
if i could go back in time and undo slavery i would
elizabeth gives him a sideways glance like no shit

elizabeth finally dislodges the chunk of fruit roll up
re fruit roll up got it
staring straight ahead you get it
scott squeezes elizabeths shoulder
thanks for listening
hey i want you to know you can talk to me about anything
slavery the holocaust relationships
they lock eyes a moment
principal snur squeezes a dolphin shaped stress ball that chirps like a dolphin with every squeeze
amy sits across from him trying to contain her glee
shaking his head test tampering
and like i said she stole the wig
i think were dealing with a criminal master mind
sorry to be the bearer of bad news wally
you know how much we all like her
its a tragedy
but amy lets keep this between us
the last thing we need is a scandal on our hands
gets up to go turns you know what scares me the most
this is just what we know
this could be the tip of the iceberg
who knows what else shes capable of
the camera is tight on a hotel room door
the faint thumping of hotel sex can be heard
elizabeth and scott are dry humping fully clothed except for their shoes and socks
oh my gosh your body feels so good
elizabeth tries pulling off her shirt
scott pulls it back down
oh my gosh im dry humping the shit out of you
dry fuck the fuck out of me

scott rolls off of elizabeth and exhales deeply
theres a wet spot on his jeans
that was a mistake

im in love with amy
but were so good together
we both hate slavery we both love teaching
and call me crazy but i always imagined us spending summers at your familys compound in hyannisport
and youre awesome and you have a huge heart and i love your empathy
its just when i was dry humping you i couldnt stop thinking about dry humping any
its because of my tits isnt it
well im getting new ones in like two days

elizabeth i think youre beautiful just the way you are even with your flat chest
and i think amys beautiful
but i just have to do whats right

scott holds up his hand showing off a promise ring
elizabeth angrily gets up and pulls on her socks

you can sleep on the other bed
ooh like a slumber party
and for the record your band sucks asstard
elizabeth opens the room door and exits
she tries slamming the door but its on a spring so it closes very very slowly
the kids listen to a tour guide on the steps of the memorial
garrett sneaks furtive glances at chase
elizabeth stands away from the group on her cell
why would i cheat
if im guilty of anything its teaching too hard
ive got nothing to hide
she ends the call
scott wearing a thomas jefferson souvenir t shirt and all of the students look over at elizabeth
the tour guide looks around uncertainly before continuing
and does anyone know what abraham lincolns nickname was
sashas hand shoots up
honest abe thats right
because lincoln always said what was on his mind even if that meant being unpopular
abraham lincoln always showed great courage
garrett takes this in
he looks over at chase and then after a beat raises his hand
i love chase streeter rossi
all eyes turn to garrett
chase looks mortified
any other questions
presses turns to chase i love you chase
ive always loved you
and even though you pretty much stopped talking to me in fifth grade i dont care
i remember the chase that wrote me a card when my dad was overweight and had to go to the hospital because of his heart that was from the whole
shut up sasha im talking about a different card
and then a year later when he left my mom and moved in with his trainer you wrote me another card
what happened to us
remember when we had a sleepover in the second grade and you wet your bed and you were so embarrassed and you made me promise not to ever tell anyone
well i never did and i never will
i know were really young but remember romeo and juliet were only
a lot of people dont know that
so there it is
my heart on a sleeve
goes into rhyming verse dont let me leave always believe a beat
chase stares at garrett
chases friends all start laughing
the rest of the class joins in
garrett runs down the steps away from everyone
alright guys lets settle down
the tour guide looks around uncertain
and these columns here are doric columns
now lets move inside to see the interior murals painted by jules guerin
the tour guide leads the group inside
elizabeth looks back and sees garrett on the steps his head in his hands
she rolls her eyes and walks down to him
hey abe lincoln get up

she just laughed at me
called me gross
youll get over it

garrett runs off
hey come back here you little elizabeth starts running after him in heels
she immediately breaks a heel

the students let out another cheer
scott contd contd alright lets do our final count off

elizabeth searches for garrett
her cell phone rings
she checks the caller id hot scott
she puts the phone back in her purse
the kids are getting restless
a lot of singing
a lot of horsing around
lets go home
lets go home
scott sits up front by the driver
hes on his cell
im freaking out here
theyve been missing over two hours
im just a substitute
then to kids shut up
the chanting immediately stops
amy the phone cradled to her ear leans back on her couch
shes wearing splotches of calamine lotion over her rash and her hair is pulled back
a turtle plods across her kitchen table
oh my gosh
we just might have a mary kay letourneau situation on our hands
amy scratches the turtles neck as it continues across the table
i dont know
the womans a criminal mastermind
this is such a mess
what i need from you is to focus and get our kids home safe
ill take care of everything here
youre a lifesaver
its what i do
love you scooter
she hangs up the phone and cockily kicks her feet onto the table accidentally knocking the turtle to the floor
were no longer in the tourist areas
a stray dog walks down the middle of the street
prostitutes hail johns with catcalls
elizabeth still in her broken heels walks down the gritty street
her phone rings
she checks the caller id hot scott
im looking for him
stop fucking calling me
she powers her phone off and continues down the street
she passes two prostitutes
im looking for a young kid about
really annoying kind of a cry baby
have you seen him
you best step off bitch because this is my block
this heres poetrys block
cause thats how she fuck
i fuck like that
something occurs to elizabeth
thank you poetry
and poetrys friend
elizabeth walks off and sticks out her hand trying to hail a cab
she passes a bunch of homeless men warming up by a trash can fire
wont get a cab in this neighborhood
a car slows next to elizabeth
a john rolls down the passenger window and leans out
how much for a titty fuck
i need a ride
oh yeah i need a ride too
right through those titties
no i need a ride
like you driving and me pointing mace at your face
ill give you ten bucks
this is weird
elizabeth hops in
parents are waiting
a few console garretts mom melody
a few local news vans idle nearby
hes gonna be alright
the police will find him
im sure theyre back at the hotel
probably just a mix up
the bus pulls up to the curb and stops
scott steps off first clearly confused by the crowd and tv cameras
immediately a reporter thrusts a mic into his face
what can you
tell us about the alleged romance between elizabeth halsey and a year old student
the students step off and the parents swarm them
oh baby are you okay
did she touch you
sashas parents engulf her in a hug
then to sashas dad you expect this stuff to happen in florida not here
garrett walks up to a drab building where he sees elizabeth on the curb waiting for him
theres a tiny sign that reads office of the poet laureate
wont be open till morning
lets get back to the hotel
im sure everyones mad at you
garrett stands his ground
im not leaving without talking to the poet laureate
do you think that some shel silverstein wannabe is going to tell you the meaning of life
what do you care
im here right
you have to be here
youre a teacher
not for long
im getting fired for cheating as soon as we get back
garrett takes a seat next to elizabeth
you came looking for me on your own
holds up her shoes and you owe me a new pair of nanette lepores
i just want to know what to say to chase to get her to like me
you know what you should do
just go out and sleep with as many girls as you possibly can
get her out of your head
theyll probably reject me too
but lifes about how you deal with rejection
you can either hide in a corner and cry or you can get stronger every time
and i figure a kid like you with not much going for him if he were to choose the latter might end up becoming a pretty strong man
now come on lets get out of here
im freezing and mr
delacourtes probably shitting a brick
i cant go back there
all the kids will laugh at me
you seriously think they havent been laughing already
maybe chase is wondering where i am
hate to break it to you kid but i dont think anyone gives two shits where we are
snur sits across from garretts mother melody who is beside herself
she is wearing a beret
a detective and amy are standing behind the desk
principal snur passes her a dolphin shaped tissue box
what else can you tell us about garrett and ms
it was strictly student teacher
garretts a gifted poet and ms
halsey was trying to bring that out of him
did they ever spend time outside of the classroom
aside from christmas at our house
the detective glances at the principal like oh boy
she used to give all the guys that look
that sex look
you know amy gives her version of a sexy look to the detective
shes a monster
tiara i think we might need to consider the possibility that elizabeth halsey has abducted your son and that the two of them are involved in a sexual relationship
marbles doesnt even have armpit hair
quietly to principal snur we should send out an amber alert
we need to catch this sicko
a reporter talks to camera on the steps of j
other news crews are in the bg
a school official close to the scandal confirms that in addition to her alleged sexual relationship with the unnamed seventh grader elizabeth halsey has been investigated for possible drug use
standardized testing fraud and the theft of an annie wig from a school production
the tv report flashes an unflattering photo of elizabeth with a blurred out garrett
in front of the school the reporter turns to principal snur
can you comment on any of these allegations
the superintendent will speak to the press shortly but for now id just like to say that i hope ms
halsey does the right thing and brings back our student
elizabeth buys two tickets
garrett hovers beside her
youre paying me back for this
elizabeths ex fiance mark stands with sheila and talks to a reporter
am i shocked
mark starts laughing
she was always very cold to me
chase is crying as she speaks to a different reporter
wiping away tears garrett sat diagonal from me in language arts
he was always so supportive of my modelling career
lynn stands with a different reporter
shes my best friend
she tells me everything
we have lunch together
tristan stands with a different reporter
ive been telling him to hit that all year
thats my boy
amy talks to a different reporter
holding a candle no child left behind
that a child was left behind
in washington d
with a statutory rapist
elizabeth and garrett are seated next to one another on the darkened train
garretts asleep against the window elizabeth is reading in style with the overhead light
garrett stirs rolls the other way and gently places his head on elizabeths shoulder
she looks at him and then shrugs her shoulder to get him off
his head falls back on
she leaves it
elizabeth is asleep on garretts shoulder
garrett is pressed against the window clearly uncomfortable
the taxi turns a corner and garrett notices something
hey theres a bunch of people outside of my house
elizabeth wakes up and looks up to see a candlelight vigil including amy scott melody and many
of garretts classmates a sea of tv cameras and what the fuck
then to garrett did you steal something
the taxi pulls up to the curb and elizabeth and garrett
theyre immediately swarmed by everyone
the cops struggle to push past
the reporters thrust mics in her face
how long have you been why did you steal the sleeping together
just the once on the train
the cops get through and smother garrett in a police blanket
a female cop roughly leads elizabeth to one of the squad cars
this is crazy
hes a kid
elizabeth is put into the back of squad car
im a good person
i dont fuck minors
elizabeth bangs on the window
amy smiles and waves
a sergeant is leading elizabeth to a phone
youre quite the celebrity
you want an autograph
you get one call
elizabeth picks up the phone
the sergeant gives her some space
hi this is elizabeth halsey calling
im calling to cancel my surgery for tomorrow
please please dont make me lose my deposit
elizabeth slams down the receiver
if you need medical attention were required to provide it
just take me back to my cell
elizabeth and her roommate kirk whos now dressed in an ill fitting suit and has his hair combed sit across from principal snur and the school superintendent a no nonsense
woman in her s
again speaking on behalf of the whole administration i just want to apologize for what happened
clearly there was a miscommunication
oh you think
kirk puts his hand up to elizabeth like ill take care of this
my client has been an upstanding member of society her entire life
she has spent time as an educator she has more than once
and she has touched the lives of those around her until last night
elizabeth pulls kirk into a lawyer client huddle
you kind of sound like a pro
do you think theyre going to find out that i didnt pass the bar
youre doing great
they break from their huddle
your administration jumped to conclusions set off a media fire storm and has humiliated one of its own
halseys chief counsel ive advised her that we have an extremely strong case of libel and that its certainly within her province to sue the district
how do we make this go away
halsey is not a litigious woman
she wants this whole matter to go away as quickly and painlessly as possible
kirk slides a piece of paper across the desk
this is a list of our demands
the superintendent and principal snur scan the list
youre kidding me
dont answer right now
let it marinate
oh and i should mention that if this goes to trial i can cry on cue
elizabeth starts crying
everybody looks at her aghast
and as quickly she started she stops
now if youll all excuse me i should be heading to fifth period
i hate to be tardy
elizabeth heads down the empty hallway
from the auditorium the faint sound of tomorrow tomorrow from annie can be heard
amy steps out of the auditorium humming along to the song
she notices elizabeth coming to her
amy debates her options
i was so worried
you gave us quite a scare you did
elizabeth doesnt acknowledge her and continues walking toward amy only feet away now
attempting some levity somebodys being a grumple bam
elizabeth punches amy square in the nose
amy drops to her knees and grabs her nose now squirting blood
elizabeth keeps walking and turns a corner
a bell rings and the hallway starts filling with students
well its been another great year at
the year is winding down
instead of gym kids are using the time to sign each others yearbooks
chase walks up to garrett with her yearbook asks him to sign it
who can forget the exciting addition of a climbing wall to the small gym
its class photo day
with each flash we see a different teacher with a different class
and finally amy with a bandage over her nose and two black eyes smiles widely alongside her class
or the student teacher spelling bee
much like the first scene of the movie
the teachers are sipping plastic flutes of champagne
principal snur is up front
elizabeth lingers in the back
i think that was a huge s u c c a s s
with summer around the corner its time to not only say goodbye to another school year but to also say goodbye to one of our own
amy her face completely healed steps forward with a pursed smile
after six short years of outstanding tireless work here amy is transferring out of the district
i know shell bring her love for learning to her new students
sandy the ponytailed teacher pipes up
although leaving was a difficult choice
amy looks over to elizabeth who motions for her to continue
when the superintendent personally asks you to work at one of the worst schools in the state you say yes
im looking forward to bringing my brand of zany energy and lust not love lust for learning to the underprivileged students at malcolm x high
i welcome the challenge
the teachers applaud scott the most enthusiastic
elizabeth steps up to amy who flinches
here i got you this
elizabeth hands amy a poster tube
opens it and unravels the integrity poster that elizabeth stole
and good luck
somebodys gonna need it
elizabeth heads for the door
scott catches up to her
then whispers listen now that amys transferring maybe the two of us could go grab a drink
elizabeth walks out
elizabeths grand am pulls into her spot
and as her bare leg steps out of the car we the hallway is empty
we follow elizabeth from behind and as she reaches for the door to her class we quick cuts
from behind we see elizabeth place an apple on each desk just as amy did earlier
elizabeths walls are still bare except for a framed photo of amys class picture with amys messed up face from the year before
the bell rings
elizabeth turns and we now see that she has tasteful fake elizabeth walks to her door and opens it watching the students as they reconnect with friends and share stories
about summer camp
she notices sasha who is massaging a boys shoulders
bunch of other eighth grade boys wait their turn
sasha clearly enjoys the attention
garrett walks by hand in hand with chase
trailing both of them are identical rolling backpacks
he sees elizabeth and runs over
you and chase huh
she likes the poetry
she likes that im kind of a celebrity
but im cool with it
im the man around here
well i should get going

oh and nice
he points at her breasts
youre the first student to notice
garrett smiles and walks off
lynn walks by
shes cleaning another big stain from her shirt
