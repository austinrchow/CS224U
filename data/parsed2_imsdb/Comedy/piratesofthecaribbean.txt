a gray impenetrable wall of fog
from somewhere comes the faint sound of a little girls voice singing slow tempo almost under her breath
yo ho yo ho a pirates life for me yo ho yo ho its a pirates life for me
suddenly a massive ship emerges from the grey the winged victory maidenhead looming
its a british dreadnought the h
formidable frightening twenty five gun ports on a side and rail guns to boot
elizabeth swann strawberry blond hair stands at the bow railing gazing at the seas still singing drink up me hearties yo ho
joshamee gibbs who was born old skin a dark leather clutches her shoulder startling her
sotto quiet missy
cursed pirates sail these waters
you want to call em down on us
elizabeth stares wide eyed at him
norrington a dashing young man royal navy to the core glares sternly at gibbs
standing besides him is governor weatherby swan a man of obvious high station brass buttons on his thick blue jacket
he is elizabeths father
that will do
she was singing about pirates
bad luck to sing about pirates with us mired in this unnatural fog mark my words
consider them marked
on your way
as he moves off bad luck to have a woman on board too
even a miniture one
he returns to his deck swabbing duties surreptitiously takes a quick swig from flask
i think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate
think again miss swan
vile and dissolute creatures the lot of them
i intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag or wears a pirates brand gets what he deserves a short drop and a sudden
elizabeth doesnt know what a short drop and a sudden stop means
gibbs helpfully mimes a man being hung
i appreciate your fervor but i am concerned about the effect this subject will have on my daughter
my apologies governor
actually i find it all fascinating
and thats what concerns me
we will be landing in port royal very soon and beginning our new lives
wouldnt it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station
chastised she turns away to look out over the bow rail
to herself i still think it would be exciting to meet a pirate
the fog still hems in the ship very little of the sea is visible but suddenly a figure comes into view
a young boy will turner floating on his back in the otherwise empty water
there is nothing to show where he came from or how he came to be there
in the water
norrington and swann spot him man overboard
fetch a hook
haul him out of there
quick movement and activity on the deck
sailors use a boathook to snag the boy he the passes
norrington and swann haul him aboard and lay him on the deck
elizabeth sidles in for a closer look
hes still breathing
where did he come from
mary mother of god
attention is turned away from the boy the sea is no longer empty
wreckage from a ship litters the water
along with the bodies of its crew
what is left of the ships hull burns a ragged british flag hanging limply from the stern
dauntless slips silently through it all
the scene calls for hushed voices
what happened here
an explosion in the powder magazine
merchant vessels run heavily armed
lot of good it did them
off swans look everyones thinking it
im just saying it
there is no proof of that
it could have been an accident
captain these men were protection
if there is even the slightest chance one of those poor devils is still alive we cannot abandon them
of course not governor
to the crew come about and strike the sails
unlash the boats
jackets off the cannons
to swann hope for the best
prepare for the worst
to two sailors move the boy aft
well need the deck clear
they lift the boy
swann pulls elizabeth away from the rail away from the hideous scene in the water
elizabeth i want you to accompany the boy
hes in your charge now
youll watch over him
elizabeth nods gravely
swann hurries away to help unstow the longboat
the sailors lay the boy gently on the poop deck behind the wheel then hurry off
elizabeth kneels down besides the boy
his good looks are not lost on her
she reaches out gently brushes the blond hair from his eyes suddenly he grabs her wrist awake now
elizabeth is startled but their eyes lock
she takes his hand in hers
my name is elizabeth swann
im watching over you will
he clutches her hands then slips back into unconsciousness
his movement has opened the collar of his shirt elizabeth sees he wears a chain around his neck
she tugs it free revealing a gold medallion
one side is blank
she turns it over a skull gazes up at her
vaguely aztec in design but to her eyes it means one thing only youre a pirate
she glances back at the crew
sees norrington giving orders moving toward her
she looks back at will comes to a quick decision
takes the medallion from around his neck
hides it under her coat
did he speak
his name is will turner thats all i found out
norrington hurries off
elizabeth steals away to the stern of the ship
examines her prize the gold medallion
a wisp of wind and she looks up out over the sea moving through the fog silent as a ghost is a large sailing ship a schooner it has black
elizabeth stares too frightened to move or cry out
the ship is obscured by the fog it as it passes but not the mizzen top
and there hangs the frightening skull and crossbones of the jolly roger
elizabeth looks from it to the medallion the skull on the flag is the same as the one on the medallion
fog surrounds and closes in on the black ship except for the black flag
as elizabeth watches the skull appears to turn and grin at her elizabeth shuts her eyes tight and then snap open again startled wide with fear
but this is no longer twelve year old elizabeth standing on the stern of the dauntless this is twenty year old elizabeth lying in bed in the dark
she remains motionless were the images we just saw a nightmare or a jumbled childhood memory
elizabeth slowly looks as far out the corner of her eyes as possible without moving
might there be someone in the room with her looming over her
she turns ready for anything
she is alone
elizabeth sits up turns up the flame on an oil lamp besides the canopied bed
she carries the lamp across the room to a dressing table sits down
she pulls one of the small drawers all the way out reaches into a space beneath it and removes the medallion
she has kept it all this time
it has not lost its luster or its sense of menace
she gazes at it as she absently returns the draw to its place a booming knock on the door elizabeth jumps up startled knocking over her chair
is everything all right
are you decent
she puts the medallion on throws on a dressing gown as swann enters carrying a large box
a uniformed maid estrella follows
still abed at this hour
its a beautiful day
estrella pulls back the heavy curtains revealing beneath a blue sky lies the bucolic town of port royal built on a natural harbor
on a bluff at the mouth of the harbor stands fort charles its stone parapets lined with cannon
i have a gift for you
he opens the boxes and displays for her a gorgeous velvet dress
she lets out an admiring gasp
may i inquire as to the occasion
is an occasion necessary for a father to dote upon his daughter with gifts
elizabeth happily takes it disappears behind a screened off dressing area
estrella follows carrying the box
i did think you could wear it to the ceremony today
captain norringtons promotion ceremony
elizabeth peeks around the screen
i knew it
or rather commodore norrington
a fine gentleman dont you think
no answer he fancies you you know
behind the screen elizabeth gasps
hows it coming
on elizabeth she holds her hair and the medallion still around her neck out of the way as the maid cinches her into a corset over her slip
estrella has her foot in elizabeths back as she pulls the laces tight
im told that dress is the very latest fashion in london
holding her breath women in london must have learned to not breath
estrella is finished
elizabeth takes a breath and winces
a butler appears in the doorway of the room
a caller is here for you
the caller dressed in rough clothing stands in the foyer looking very out of place and knowing it
he holds a long presentation case
he polishes the toes of his boots on the back of his calves but it doesnt help
its good to see you again
the caller turns it is will turner
handsome with a watchful demeanor that gives him weight beyond his years
good day sir
holds out the case i have your order
swann hurries to him opens the case
inside is a beautiful dress sword and scabbard
swann takes it out reverently
the blade is folded steel
thats gold filigree laid into the handle
if i may he takes the sword from swann and balances it on one finger at the point where the blade meets the guard
the tang is nearly the full width of the blade
commodore norrington will be pleased im sure
do pass my compliments on to your master
wills face falls
clearly the work is his and he is proud of it
with practiced ease he flips the sword around catches it by the hilt and returns it to the case
bows slightly i shall
a craftsman is always pleased to hear his work is appreciated he stops speaking abruptly staring past swann elizabeth stands on the stairs
granted the dress may be painful to wear but holy smokes
you look stunning
will tries to speak but cant
he gives up smiles to himself and simply nods emphatically
its so good to see you
her hand goes to the chain around her throat the medallion is hidden in the bodice of her dress
i dreamt about you last night
will reacts with surprise really
elizabeth this is hardly appropriate ignores her father about the day we met
do you remember
i could never forget it miss swann
will how many times must i ask you to call me elizabeth
at least once more miss swann
elizabeth is disappointed and a little hurt by his response
theres a boy who understands propriety
now we must be going
swann takes the case from will opens the door for elizabeth
elizabeth straightens her back gathers her skirts and strides past will
good day mr
swann follows elizabeth out the door
he watches as she is helped aboard a carriage by the driver
to himself elizabeth
in the carriage swann glowers at his daughter
dear i do hope you demonstrate a bit more decorum in front of commodore norrington
after all it is only through his efforts that port royal has become at all civilized
the skeletal remains of four pirates still clad in buccaneer rags hang from gallows erected on a rocky promontory
there is a fifth unoccupied gallows bearing a sign the top of a billowing sail passes regally in front of them
on the landward face of the sail apparently high in the rigging is a man for whom the term swashbuckling rogue was coined captain jack sparrow
he gazes keen eyed at the display as they pass
raises a tankard in salute
suddenly something below catches his attention
he jumps from the rigging and thats when we see that his is ship is not an imposing three master but just a small fishing dory with a single sail
plowing through the water the jolly mon
and it leaks
which is why he has the tankard to bail
jack steps back to the tiller and using a single sheet to control the sail and the jolly mon comes around the promontory the whole of port royal laid out
the huge british dreadnought h
dauntless dominates the bay
but jacks attention is on a different ship the h
interceptor a small sleek vessel with rail guns and a mortar in the middle of the main deck
it is tied up at the navy landing at the base of the cliffs below fort charles
smoothly and with no wasted movement jack hauls down the sail stows it guides the dory alongside a dock
the harbormaster a long ledger tucked under his arm is there to catch a line and help jack tie up
if youre out rolling scuppers in this tub youre either incredibly brave or incredibly stupid
its remarkable how often those two traits coincide
he starts up the dock strapping on his sword belt besides the scabbard it also carries a compass pistol and small powder horn
the harbormaster cuts him off
its a shilling for the dock space and youre going to have to give me your name
what do you say to three shillings and we forget the name
he tosses three shillings onto the ledger
the harbormaster considers then shuts the ledger on the coins steps aside
welcome to port royal mr
jack gives him a half salute as he goes past
looks across the water toward the interceptor and smiles
above the interceptor among the parapets of fort charles a ceremony is underway with choreographed precision swann removes the sword and scabbard from the presentation case held by a uniformed
he slides the sword into the scabbard holds it out vertically to norrington in full dress uniform
norrington grasps the scabbard above swanns hand and swann lets go
norrington draws the sword flourishes the sword and snaps the blade up in front of his face
swann steps forward pins a medal to norringtons jacket steps back
norrington nods turns smartly and nods to his fellow officers turns again and nods to the audience dignitaries merchants plantation owners their families
another flourish and he returns the sword to its scabbard
the silence is broken by loud applause
backslapping from the navy men
in the audience elizabeth doesnt look so good out beneath the hot sun
she applauds briefly then winces
discreetly tries to adjust the corset through the material of the dress then resumes clapping trying to hide her discomfort
two sailors on sentry duty murtogg and mullroy take advantage of what little shade there is on the dock
but when jack saunters up they are immediately on alert
this dock is off limits to civilians
sorry i didnt know
music drifts down from fort charles
jack looks up shields his eyes
some sort of to do up at the fort eh
you two werent invited
someone has to make sure this dock stays off limits to civilians
this must be some important boat
captain norringtons made it his flagship
hell use it to hunt down the last dregs of piracy on the spanish lake
thats a fine goal im sure
but it seems to me a ship like that indicates the dauntless makes this one here just a wee superfluous
oh the dauntless is the power in these waters true enough but theres no ship that can match the interceptor for speed
ive heard of one supposed to be fast nigh uncatchable
the black pearl
mullroy scoffs at the name
theres no real ship as can match the interceptor
the black pearl is a real ship
no its not
yes it is
ive seen it
youve seen it
youve seen the black pearl
you havent seen it
yes i have
youve seen a ship with black sails thats crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out
but ive seen a ship with black sails
oh and no ship thats not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil hell itself spat him back out could possibly have black sails and therefore
couldnt possibly be any ship other than the black pearl
is that what youre saying
turns back to jack like i said theres no real ship as can match hey
but jacks not there
murtogg and mullroy look around spot jack standing at the wheel of the interceptor casually examining the mechanism
jack looks over in exaggeratedly innocent surprise
the sailors hurry toward the gangplank
get away from there
you dont have permission to be aboard there
jack spreads his hands in apology
its just such a pretty boat
the sailors study him suspiciously
whats your name
whats your business in port royal mr
and no lies
youve rumbled me
i confess i intend to commandeer one of these ships pick up a crew in tortuga and go out on the account do a little honest pirating
i said no lies
i think hes telling the truth
hes not telling the truth
he may be
if he were telling the truth he wouldnt have told us
unless of course he knew you wouldnt believe the truth if he told it to you
murtogg and mullroy consider that point elizabeth pale and perspiring fans herself weakly oblivious to the music and chatter
may i have a moment
he extends his arm
she takes it
he walks her away from the party toward the parapet
a rather too long of a silence as norrington works up his courage
a burst you look lovely
elizabeth frowns unable to focus
norrington mistakes her expression as disapproval
i apologize if i seem forward but i must speak my mind
working up his confidence to do so this promotion confirms that i have accomplished the goals i set for myself in my career
but it also casts into sharp relief that which i have not achieved
the thing all men most require a marriage to a fine woman
beat you have become a fine woman elizabeth
i cant breathe
smiles im a bit nervous myself elizabeth loses her balance stumbles away from norrington
she reaches a hand out to the parapet to steady herself but it slides off and then she vanishes over the wall
jack reacts pushes murtogg aside to see elizabeth plummets from the top of the cliff
it seems to take her a long time to reach the sea elizabeth hits the water narrowly missing the sharp rocks
a wave breaks and then she is washed out away from the cliff struggling feebly
at the fort norrington looks down he leaps to the top of the parapet prepared to dive a lieutenant gillette catches his arm
the rocks sir
its a miracle she missed them
norrington shakes off his arm looks down and realizes gillette is right
he jumps down and runs jack murtogg and mullroy are still in shock from the sight
arent you going to save her
i cant swim
murtogg shakes his head neither does he
rolls his eyes sailors
above where elizabeth struggles in the water
norrington and several other men pick their way down the cliffs
they are too far away to get to her in time
he has no choice and it pisses him off
he pulls a pistol from his sword belt hands it to murtogg then hands the belt to mullroy
dont lose these
and then he dives into the water swims toward elizabeth
elizabeth struggles to keep above water gasping for air then a swell rolls over her and she is submerged underwater elizabeth drifts down unconscious
the current turns her and the medallion slips loose from her bodice
the medallion turns slowly until the skull is fully visible
a shaft of filtered sunlight hits it and it fort charles the british flag flies blown from an offshore breeze
suddenly the wind dies and the flag goes limp
on the docks wood and metal fittings on lines bang against masts
the wind dies and there is silence
on the edge of town a caribe woman feeds clucking chickens frowns when they all suddenly go quiet
in the village a weather vane moves slightly in the wind
the wind stops and all is still
the weather vane turns and holds steady the wind has picked up again but now blows
from the sea toward the land
l on the beach an old salt pulls a rope line pauses
turns and gazes to the sky frowning
the mangy hound at his side starts barking incessantly on the docks the lines bang against the other sides of the masts the wind far stronger now
fort charles the british flag flies in the opposite direction snapping in the new onshore breeze
norrington rushes down intent on the climb
beyond him past the rocky point far out to sea fog gathers underwater the medallion hangs below elizabeths unmoving form and then jack is there
he wraps an arm around her and makes for the surface
on the surface jack swims toward the dock struggling
far more difficult than it should be
he stops stroking and they submerge
underwater jack realizes that it is elizabeths heavy velvet dress that is weighing them down
he pulls at the buttons on the back and they give way
he skins her out of the dress and kicks away from it
the dress falls like a cloud into darkness on the surface jack swims with elizabeth much more quickly
at the dock murtogg and mullroy are there to help haul elizabeth out of the water
jack climbs up exhausted
elizabeth is on her back murtogg holds her arms above her head pumping them
mullroy puts his cheek to her nose and mouth
murtogg looks down it seems hopeless
jack steps up drawing murtoggs knife from its sheath
he pushes past mullroy kneels over elizabeth raises the knife murtogg is shocked jack slits the corset down the middle yanks it away
elizabeth remains still
and then she coughs up water and gasps choking on her first full breath
jack is relieved
i never would have thought of that
clearly youve never been to singapore
jack flips the knife and hands it hilt first to murtogg and thats when he spots the medallion
jack catches it up in his hand
where did you get this
before elizabeth can answer the blade of a sword is at jacks throat norringtons new ceremonial sword in fact looking bright and sharp
on your feet
it looks bad jack standing over elizabeth most of her clothes gone
he gets to his feet
the rest of elizabeths erstwhile rescuers reach the scene including swann
are you all right
he strips off his jacket drapes it around her
yes yes im fine commodore norrington do you intend to kill my rescuer
norrington looks at jack
jack nods as best he can with a blade beneath his chin
norrington sheathes his sword and extends his hand
i believe thanks are in order
jack takes norringtons hand gingerly
they shake and norrington tightens his grip yanks jacks arm toward him then tears back the sleeve of jacks shirt exposing a brand on jacks inner wrist a large p
had a brush up with the east india trading company did you
the others react in shock but the sailors are well trained in an instant half a dozen pistols are aimed at jack
he stands there still holding the corset
keep your guns on him men
gillette fetch some irons
norrington notices something else below the p brand is a tattoo a small bird in flight across water
jack sparrow isnt it
captain jack sparrow
if you please
norrington looks out at the bay
i dont see your ship captain
he said hed come to commandeer one
to murtogg i told you he was telling the truth
currying favor these are his sir
he holds out jacks pistol and belt
norrington takes the pistol examines it notes the powder horn on jacks belt
to jack extra powder but no additional shot
norrington unhooks the compass from the belt opens it
he frowns at the reading
moves the compass this way and that keeping it parallel to the ground
it doesnt bear true
jack looks away a bit embarrassed
norrington returns the compass to the belt
draws the sword half from the scabbard
i half expected it to be made of wood
he slides it back into the scabbard hands it to mullroy
taking stock youve got a pistol with only one shot a compass that doesnt point north
and no ship
you are without a doubt the worst pirate i have ever heard of
ah but you have heard of me
gillette returns with shackles approaches jack
elizabeth steps forward
swanns jacket slips off her
she is unconcerned but he is intent on putting it back on her
commodore i must protest
pirate or not this man saved my life
one good deed is not enough to redeem a man of a lifetime of wickedness
gillette snaps the manacles closed on jacks wrists
but it seems to be enough to condemn him
now that jack is safely chained norrington nods to his men
all but one stow their weapons and two step forward finally
lightning quick he snaps the corset around the hand and wrist of the man holding the pistol and yanks
the pistol sails into the water
before anyone can react to that jack has the manacle chain wrapped around elizabeths throat
pistols are drawn again but now elizabeth serves as a shield
norrington raises a cautioning hand to his men
backing away toward land commodore norrington
my pistol and belt please
norrington hesitates balls his fists in frustration
mullroy hands the pistol and belt to norrington
norrington holds them out to jack
elizabeth it is elizabeth
elizabeth is more angry than frightened
elizabeth miss swann
miss swann if youll be so kind
she takes the belt and pistol from norrington jacks quicker than she is and takes the pistol from her
he jerks her around so she is facing him belly to belly
now if youll be very kind
she figures out what he wants put the belt on him
as she works you are despicable
i saved your life now youve saved mine
he turns her again and then backs up until he bumps against the cargo gantry
you will always remember this as the day you almost caught captain jack sparrow
he shoves elizabeth away grabs a rope and pulls free a belaying pin a counterweight drops and jack is lifted up to the middle of the gantry where he grabs
a second rope pistols fire and miss
jack swings out out out away and around from the gantry
norrington has held his shot
with careful aim he tracks jacks trajectory jack drops from the rope even as norrington fires
his shot tears the rope as jack plummets past one of the gantrys guy lines he snaps the length of manacle chain over the line and grabs hold of the
far loop slides down the line drops to the deck of a ship
he runs leaping to another ship then out of sight on his heels
gillette bring a squad down from the fort
to elizabeth elizabeth are you yes im all right im fine
go capture him
norringtons taken aback by her ire and wisely hurries away
swann drapes his coat around elizabeth
you should wear this
elizabeth shivers finding suddenly that she is cold
glances out at the bay where a thick fog moves across the top of the water
she takes the jacket
thank you father
and let that be the last of your fashion advice please
but she accepts his comforting embrace
the fog creeps through casting an eerie twilight pall
an armed search party moves along the street
they glance down an alley on the far side is another search party
the men nod to each other continue on
a moment and then jack drops from his hiding place beneath the eaves of a building
he still wears the manacles
across the street is a shop with barn doors a pass thru door set in the middle
above is a sign with a black anvil
jack slips in through the door takes a look around no windows
the forge is dark lit by lanterns
work in progress is scattered about wagon wheels wrought iron gates pipes even a cannon with a crack in it
but every tool is in place the workbench is tidy and neat
jack is startled by a noise mister brown in a blacksmiths apron snores in the corner cradling a bottle
jack gives him a hard poke
brown snorts turns away
satisfied jack sheathes his sword takes a short handled sledge from its place on the wall
moves to the glowing coke furnace in the middle of the room
he holds his right hand over the furnace the chain down in the embers
the chain begins to glow
jack sweats grimaces at the pain moving quickly he wraps the chain around the nose of an anvil brings the sledge down with a fast hard stroke on the glowing
jack drops the sledge plunges his manacled hand in a bucket of water
jack pulls his hand out flexes it
blisters form beneath the manacle but his hands are free
the sound of the latch on the door jack dives for cover
will enters the forge shuts the door behind him
spots the drunken mister brown in the corner
right where i left you
something catches his eye an empty peg on the wall
the sledge lying beside the anvil
under his breath not where i left you
he moves casually toward the sledge
then grabs for it but the flat of a sword blade slaps his hand
will jumps back
jack stands there sword leveled at will
he backs will up toward the door
will glares at him
voice low and tight youre the one theyre hunting
jack acknowledges it with a tip of his head
then frowns regards will
you look familiar
have i ever threatened you before
ive made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates
then it would be a shame to put a black mark on your record
so if youll excuse me
beside the door is a grindstone a sword resting in the honing guide
before jack can react will has it in hand
do you think this is wise boy
crossing blades with a pirate
you threatened miss swann
only a little
in response will assumes an en garde position
jack appraises him unhappy to see will knows what hes doing
the two men stand in one place trading feints thrusts and parries with lightning speed almost impossible to follow
will has no trouble matching jack
you know what youre doing ill give you that
excellent form but hows your footwork
if i step here he takes a step around an imaginary circle
will steps the other way maintaining his relationship to jack
and if i step again you step again
continuing to step around the circle and so we circle circle like dogs we circle
they are now exactly opposite their initial positions
jack turns and heads for the door now directly behind him
will registers angry surprise and then with a vicious overhand motion he throws his sword the sword buries itself into the door just above the latch barely missing jack
jack registers it then pulls on the latch but it wont move up the sword is in the way
jack rattles the latch
tugs on the sword a few times it is really stuck in there
jack mouths a curse but when he turns back to will hes smiling
thats a good trick
except once again you are between me and the way out
points his sword at the back door and now you have no weapon
eyes on jack will simply picks up a new sword from an anvil
jack slumps in dismay but then leaps forward
will and jack duel
their blades flash and ring
suddenly jack swings the chain still manacled to his left hand at wills head
will ducks it comes up wide eyed
then jacks chain smashes across wills sword disarming him
will quickly picks up another sword
jack becomes aware that the entire room is filled with bladed weapons swords knives boarding axes in various stages of completion
who makes all these
and i practice with them
at least three hours a day
you need to find yourself a girl
will sets his jaw or maybe the reason you practice three hours a day is youve found one but cant get her
a direct hit and will coils even more tightly with anger
i practice three hours a day so that when i meet a pirate
i can kill him
he explodes kicks a rack causing a sword to fall into his hand uses his foot to bring his dropped sword into the air catches it and attacks jack both
jack parries with sword and chain
jacks chain wraps around wills sword will twists the handle of his guard through a link and stabs the sword up into the ceiling so jacks manacled left arm is
now suspended from the ceiling
he parries using one hand twisting and dodging around the furnace jack compresses the bellows blowing a shower of sparks into wills face
jack grabs the chain hoists himself up kicks with his feet knocking will back
jack uses his full weight yanks the sword from the ceiling
hurls a wooden mallet at will then a second hitting will on the wrist
will drops his sword falls down gets up jacks pistol is aimed directly between wills eyes
will steps back directly in front of the back exit
glares rubs his wrist gingerly
smiles what do you expect
jack steps forward
will steps back fully blocking the door
i can not just step aside and let you escape
jack cocks the pistol
will stares back
the stand off lasts for a long moment
youre lucky boy this shots not meant for you
jack uncocks the pistol
will is surprised reassesses jack suddenly mister brown slams his bottle against jacks skull
jack crumples to the ground
the front and back doors smash open and sailors fill the room
norrington pushes forward sees jack on the ground
excellent work mister brown
youve aided in the capture of a dangerous fugitive
just doing my civic duty
norrington stands over him smiles
i believe you will always remember this as the day captain jack sparrow almost escaped
norringtons men haul jack away
will watches them go
brown looks at his bottle broken
that ratter broke my bottle
the thick fog blankets the entire bay now and the town
the only structure visible is fort charles high on the bluff like a tall ship sailing a sea of grey
above the fort is a clear black sky sprinkled with stars
a waxing moon shines giving both fort and fog an eerie glow
just below the stone parapets of the fort visible briefly deep in the fog like a shark fin slicing through the water the topmast of a ship black sails billowing
flying from the mast is a flag with white aztec skull
the black pearl has come to port royal
a maid removes a bed warmer from the fireplace slides it between the sheets at the end of elizabeths bed
nice and toasty
thank you estrellia
the maid nods exits
elizabeth opens a book begins reading toying absently with the medallion chain around her neck
the lamp flame begins to diminish
elizabeth tries to turn it up
the flame goes out and the room is black
will shirtless wearing a leather apron heats an iron ingot at the furnace hammers it flat he stops
his attention is drawn to the window
he opens the shutter and peers out nothing but fog
almost without noticing he reaches for a boarding axe hanging on the wall
takes it down it has a satisfying weight in his hands
close on a mutt of a dog holding a ring of keys in his mouth
three seedy looking prisoners try to coax the dog to their cell door
one holds a loop of rope another waggles a bone
the dog just sits and cocks its head
come here boy
want a nice juicy bone
in an adjoining cell jack lies on a pile of straw
you can keep doing that forever that dogs never going to move
excuse us if we aint resigned ourselves to the gallows just yet
a noose hangs from a gallows in the courtyard
norrington and swann walk along the far wall
has my daughter given you an answer yet
well she had a taxing day
ghastly weather tonight
from the distance there is a boom what was that
and then the whistle of an incoming ball cannon fire
he tackles swann as the wall of the parapet explodes jack sits up
there are more booms i know those guns
he peers out through the bars of the window
the other prisoners crowd around their window as well
its the black pearl
frightened the black pearl
ive heard stories
shes been preying on ships and settlements for near ten years
and never leaves any survivors
there are a lot of stories about the black pearl
the black pearl still cannot be seen but the fog lights up around her with each boom of her guns
shes firing on both sides now hammering both the fort and the town
streets buildings docks and ships shatter and explode beneath the onslaught
villagers panic run for cover dodge flying debris as best they can
if this is not hell on earth then its about to be long boats emerge out of the fog carrying armed pirates
they swarm from the boats striking down villagers indiscriminately and setting fires
will slips the boarding axe into his belt at the small of his back
he puts a dirk in his belt then a second and a third
he picks up a second axe and a sword
will slides back the doors of the forge a woman runs past chased by a one armed pirate wearing a yellow bandeau
will backhands the axe square into his chest a deadly blow
will heads out up the street the moon is obscured by smoke rising from the burning gallows and wooden roofs
cannon fire continues to rain down but the forts own cannons now return fire
barricade yourself in my office
swann hesitates thats an order
swann turns to go but finds himself face to face with a pirate koehler a handsome blond man with gold earrings
beyond koehler more pirates come up over the far wall
koehler grins and raises a cutlass norringtons sword blocks koehlers slash
theyve flanked us
swords and pistols
the battle is joined int
governors mansion elizabeth f s bedroom night elizabeth looks out a window at the scene below even through the fog multiple fires are visible and ships burn in the harbor
shouts and cries of pain
cannon fire she notices movement directly below her window two shadowy figures approaching the house pirates
elizabeth bolts from her room she reaches the railing overlooking the foyer and cries out just as the butler opens the door too late there is the boom of a
gun and the butler crumples
elizabeth ducks down in horror peering through the balusters
the pirates scan the foyer searching
the leader is pintel a sallow looking pirate with a bald head
suddenly pintel looks up and locks eyes with elizabeth
how could he know she was there
the pirates rush for the stairs
elizabeth scrambles back into the nearest room elizabeth shuts the door locks it listens as the pirates pound up the stairs miss elizabeth
estrella is right behind her terrified
they whisper are they come to kidnap you miss
the daughter of the governor would be very valuable
elizabeth realizes shes right
there is the slam of a body against the door
listen estrella they havent seen you
hide and first chance run for the fort
another slam at the door it gives a bit elizabeth shoves estrella into the corner between a tall wardrobe and the wall
dashes for the side door
when the door smashes inward it slams into the wardrobe and the maid cannot be seen
the pirates run in spot the open side door and run for it pintel is the first through and gets the pan of the bed warmer in the face for
his trouble he staggers back holding his nose estrella breaks cover runs for the hall unnoticed
elizabeth swings the bed warmer at the second pirate but he catches it by the handle elizabeth cant jerk it free so she wrenches it over the pan lid swings
down banging the second pirate hot coals spill on his head sizzling
elizabeth dashes for the hallway stairs the pirates burst from the bedroom pintel goes for the stairs but the second pirate vaults the handrail estrella registers the butlers body but
continues out the still open front door at a dead run
elizabeth follows the second pirate lands between elizabeth and the front door
his face is burned his hair smolders he reaches elizabeth pulls up short runs the other way pintel on the stairs grabs her by the hair elizabeth doesnt slow she
spins grabs pintels arm with both hands and pulls him hard belly first into the cap of the newel post he lets go of her hair elizabeth keeps going elizabeth slams the double doors shut throws the bolts
the interior shutters are closed over the windows
above the fireplace are two crossed swords
elizabeth climbs on the firebox she grabs one of the swords by the hilt and pulls but it wont come free
both swords are securely attached to the wall
a smash from the doors the pirates are relentless on the table is a platter with fruit cheese and bread
elizabeth grabs the knife from the platter like any bread knife it has a round point
elizabeth jabs it into her palm its useless as a weapon
the blade of a boarding axe breaches the door the pirates will be through soon elizabeth looks around the doors give way the pirates charge through empty
elizabeth nowhere to be seen
pintel and smoldering pirate search under the table behind draperies
we know youre here poppet
come out and we promise we wont hurt you
smoldering pirate gives him look he wants to hurt her plenty
pintel shakes his head dont worry im lying
we will find you poppet
youve got something of ours and it calls to us
elizabeth hides in the dumbwaiter box wrapped around the double pulley ropes that go through the center
the gold calls to us
elizabeth registers that she pulls out the medallion rubs the gold with her thumb
this is their objective
light spills into the box through gaps in the top as the door above is slid open elizabeth looks up through the gaps pintel leers down at her
elizabeth works the ropes to lower the box
pintel pulls the other way hes stronger and the box rises
elizabeth tries to stop it wraps her left forearm through the rope and lets it jam against the top of the box
elizabeth gasps at the pain but the box stops
she saws at the rope with the bread knife
smoldering pirate helps pull the rope crushing elizabeths forearm
tears of pain on her face she keeps sawing the rope parts and the dumbwaiter box plummets from behind the door of the dumbwaiter comes a crash and a cloud
the door slides open and elizabeth clambers out
her head is cut she is streaked with dirt and can barely stand
she leans over the table trying to recover
the sound of running footsteps gets louder
elizabeth touches the chain of the medallion
and a desperate idea occurs to her
the pirates burst through the door
elizabeth backs away holds the bread knife out to ward them off
they come around either side of the table stalking her gasps it out par
pintel cant believe his ears
i invoke the right of parlay
according to the code of the brethren set down by the pirates morgan and bartholomew you must take me to your captain
i know the code
if an adversary demands parley you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete
it would appear so do you
to blazes with the code
he steps forward dirk drawn pintel stops him
she wants to be taken to the captain and shell go without a fuss
he looks to elizabeth right
we must honor the code
smoldering pirate concedes the point sheaths his dirk
he grabs elizabeth roughly by the arm will races along momentarily free of the pirates
he spots the governors mansion in the distance
there are figures moving away from it elizabeth forced by the two pirates
will hurries forward suddenly a pirate jumps out from the shadows slashes will defends himself
the pirate has one arm and wears a yellow bandana
will hesitates didnt he already kill this guy
the hesitation is just enough for another pirate swinging a flaming torch to slam will in the head from behind
the pirate lights a second torch hands it to one arm they hoot with delight and head off setting fires as they go
on the ground will doesnt move
the wall of the cells explodes inward
jack pulls himself out from under rubble
moonlight spills in through the gaping hole created by the cannon ball
beyond it freedom
but it is centered on the other cell
the part of jacks cell that is gone is too small for a man to slip through
he and the other two scramble through
back to jack my sympathies friend youve no manner of luck at all
the three descend the rocks beyond disappearing from view
jack is alone
cannon fire continues occasional hits shaking the fort
the dog cowers under a long bench key ring still in his mouth
jack sighs resigned he picks up the bone from the other cell and tries coax the dog forward
its all right doggie
come here boy
come here spot
to his surprise the dog crawls out from under the bench
jack continues to coax him closer
the key ring is nearly within jacks reach suddenly the dogs attention goes to the door into the cell block
he bristles growls
he backs away from the door whining
whats the matter boy
the dog bolts through the bars into the cell then out through the breached wall taking the keys with him
the door to the cell block bursts open
a pair of pirates step in koehler and twigg
this isnt the armory
he turns to go but koehler has spotted jack
dutch accent well well
look what we have here twigg
last time i saw you you were all alone on a god forsaken island shrinking into the distance
id heard youd gotten off but i didnt believe it
did you sprout little wings and flyaway
his fortunes arent improved much
the two laugh
he steps forward close to the bars
this puts him in a spill of moonlight
he is tight with fury
worry about your own fortunes
the lowest circle of hell is reserved for betrayers
koehler and twigg dont like hearing that
koehler lashes out grabs jack by the throat through the bars
jack clutches the pirates wrist looks down where they enter the moonlight koehlers wrists and hands are skeletal
jacks eyes go wide he is holding a skeleton arm
you are cursed
koehler sneers shoves jack backwards hard
now out of the moonlight his hand is normal
jack stares realizing the stories are true
koehler ushers twigg toward the door
you know nothing of hell
and then theyre gone
amid the thunder of cannon fire a longboat slips through the fog
elizabeth sits in the prow
columns of water from cannon balls geyser up around the boat
the fog parts
elizabeth looks up to see the black pearl a tall galleon its black sails looming high above her
at the bow is an ornately carved figurehead of a beautiful woman arm held high a small bird taking wing from her outstretched hand
the longboat makes for a pair of lines dangling from a winch
lit by lanterns no moon is visible beneath the fog
smoke hangs heavy above the deck
elizabeths longboat is raised above the deck rail pirates spot her and stare
one polite fellow steps forward to offer his hand
she takes it and steps down
she huddles self conscious in her nightgown and dressing robe
i didnt know we was taking captives
shes invoked the right of parlay
with captain barbossa
on the poop deck an imposing figure in silhouette stands by the wheel too far away to have heard pintels words
but his head turns at the mention of his name
the silhouetted figure moves toward the stairs
a cloud of smoke obscures him and then as if he skipped the stairs he strides out of the smoke on the main deck this is barbossa
despite the bright colors of clothing definitely not a man youd want to meet in a dark alley or anywhere for that matter
elizabeth more terrified than ever cannot look away from his eyes
but she musters her courage i am here to the bosun slaps her
youll speak when spoken to
his wrist is grabbed painfully by barbossa
and youll not lay a hand on those under the protection of parlay
barbossa releases him
turns to elizabeth smiles it shows both silver and gold teeth
my apologies miss
as you were saying before you were so rudely interrupted
i have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against port royal
barbossa is both impressed and amused
there was a lot of long words in there miss and were not but humble pirates
what is it you want
i want you to leave
and never come back
barbossa and the pirates laugh
i am disinclined to acquiesce to your request
helpfully means no
she quickly slips the medallion off darts to the side rail dangles it over the side of the ship
the pirates go quiet
ill drop it
my holds are bursting with swag
that bit of shine matters to me why
because its what youre searching for
youve been searching for it for years
i recognize this ship
i saw it eight years ago when we made the crossing from england
interested did you now
elizabeth glares at him
shes getting nowhere
i suppose if this is worthless theres no reason to keep it
she flips the medallion up off her finger she catches it by the chain smiles at him triumphantly
you have a name missy
elizabeth stops herself from saying swann then turner
embroidering im a maid in the governors household
curtsies barbossa reacts to the name turner it confirms what he has suspected
the other pirates surreptitiously exchange glances and nods
youve got sand for a maid
curtsies again thank you sir
and how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that
a family heirloom perhaps
offended i didnt steal it if thats what you mean
no no nothing like that
comes to a decision very well
you hand that over well put your town to our rudder and neer return
can i trust you
its you who invoked the parlay
believe me miss youd best hand it over now
or these be the last friendly words youll hear
elizabeth hesitates but she has no choice
she holds out the medallion
he grabs it clutches it in his fist like hope
barbossa grins devilishly but then nods to the bosun
still the guns and stow em
signal the men set the flags and make good to clear port
for the first time since the attack began the booming of the guns ceases
elizabeth is surprised and relieved
the pirates hustle to follow orders
barbossa turns away
you must return me to shore
according to the rules of the order of the brethren barbossa wheels on her
your return to shore was not part of our negotiations nor our agreement and so i must do nothing
secondly you must be a pirate for the pirates code to apply
and youre not
the code is more what youd call guidelines than actual rules
grins gold and silver welcome aboard the black pearl miss turner
elizabeth stares in speechless terror as the black pearl turns out to sea elizabeth is led back along the deck to the captains cabin
the fog starts to dissipate turning to a light mist through it the black pearl makes for the scarlet glow of dawn
will comes to still where he fell gets to his feet
he takes in the devastation of port royal the harbor is dotted with burning and sunken ships buildings are razed and still smolder
the aftermath of hell on earth
will turns and runs for the governors mansion
will races past the smashed doors into the foyer
calls out miss swann
a terrible silence answers him
he spots an overturned chair fallen bookshelf will bursts in still armed with sword and boarding axe
theyve taken her
theyve taken elizabeth
a group stares at him swann norrington and gillette among others gathered around a map
the map is so large it drapes over the governors desk the far end supported by a chair
were aware of the situation
we have to hunt them down and save her
swanns worry has made him short tempered
where do you propose we start
if you have any information that concerns my daughter then share it
if anyone does tell me
will is silent leave mr
murtogg has remembered something
he ventures it warily that jack sparrow
he talked about the black pearl
mentioned it is more what he did
still we can ask him where it is maybe he can lead us to it
that pirate tried to kill my daughter
we could never trust a word he said
we could strike a bargain no
the pirates who invaded this fort left sparrow locked in his cell
ergo he is not their ally and therefore of no value
through with will we will determine their most likely course and launch a search mission that sails with the tide
will slams the boarding axe into the desk through the map
thats not good enough
this is elizabeths life
norrington is quick to react he throws a strong arm across wills back and guides him roughly to the door
turner this is not the time for rash actions
low do not make the mistake of thinking you are the only man here who loves elizabeth
firm now go home
he opens the door and then turns away
will watches him walk back to the desk
wills face sets in resolve and he leaves
jack strains trying to budge one of the bars
even with the damage from the cannon ball it wont move
he hears the sound of the door latch the door opens and will slips in
jack lounges on the floor of his cell apparently relaxed and unconcerned
will marches straight up to the bars
are you familiar with that ship
the black pearl
where does it make berth
surely youve heard the stories
the black pearl sails from the dreaded isla de mureta
an island that cannot be found except by those who already know where it is
the ships real enough
so its anchorage must be a real place
where is it
why ask me
because youre a pirate
and you want to turn pirate yourself
beat they took miss swann
he was right so it is that you found a girl
well if youre intending to brave all and hasten to her rescue and so win fair ladys heart youll have to do it alone
i see no profit in it for me
will slams his fist against the bars in frustration
jack is surprised at the outburst
makes a decision
i can get you out of here
the keys run off
examines the cell i helped build these cells
those are hook and ring hinges
the proper application of strength the doorll lift free
just calls for the right lever and fulcrum
jack watches will as he speaks and it dawns on him will is the spitting image of someone hes known in the past
your name is turner
will gives him a puzzled look
he stands ill tell you what mr
ive changed my mind
you spring me from this cell and on pain of death ill you to the black pearl
sticks out his hand do we have an accord
will gives him a suspicious look
the deal seems too good
jack keeps his hand out still smiling
will shakes it
will looks around figures out what he needs
he makes a chair his fulcrum and levers the long bench under the door
pushes down its hard work but the cell door rises and then falls forward crashing down on the bench and chair
jack is impressed
he steps out of the cell
someone will have heard that
will heads for the door
jack searches the desk cupboards
not without my effects
we need to go
jack finds his pistol sword belt and compass
straps on the belt checks the shot in his pistol
why are you bothering with that
my business will
as for your business one question or theres no use going
joins will at the door this girl what does she mean to you
how far are you willing to go to save her
no hesitation id die for her
the jolly mon four inches of water in the bottom squats low in the water heeled to one side creaking on its lines
ah now theres a lovely sight
jack hops down into the boat
prepares to make way
i knew the harbormaster wouldnt report her
honest men are slaves to their conscience and theres no predicting em
but you can always trust a dishonest man to stay that way
jack notices that will is standing frozen on the dock staring at the boat in dismay
i havent set foot off dry land i was twelve when the ship i was on exploded
regards the boat its been a sound policy
no worries there
shes far more likely to rot out from under us
will steels himself steps into the boat as if its going to capsize with the slightest movement
jack hoists the sail
besides we are about to better our prospects considerably
he nods toward the h
dauntless looming in the harbor
will whiteknuckles the gunwales
were going to steal a ship
were going to commandeer a ship
its still against the law
sos breaking a man out of jail
face it will you may say youll never be a pirate but youre off to a rip roaring start
smiling my advice smile and enjoy it
the jolly mon bobs its way across the bay dwarfed against the h
will holds a stay line with iron fists
this is either crazy or brilliant
remarkable how often those two traits coincide
the jolly man nears the rudder of the much larger ship theres been a breakdown in discipline about a dozen navy sailors are gathered together on the main deck playing
murtogg and mullroy among them
suddenly jack and will jump out into the open brandishing pistols
everybody stay calm
were taking over the ship
a beat aye
jack gives him a look shakes his head dont do that
the sailors all look at them and then burst out laughing
they grin shake their heads
jack stands there grinning with them but his gun is still level
the lieutenant gillette steps forward
youre serious about this
jack moves his pistol across points it at gillette
you understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men
youll never make it out of the bay
well see about that
more guffaws from the crew
a couple sailors move forward hands on swords gillette holds up a hand
sir ill not see any of my men killed or wounded in this foolish enterprise
fine by me
we brought you a nice little boat so you can all get back to shore safe and sound
a curt nod agreed
you have the momentary advantage sir
but i will see you smile from the yard arm sir
as likely as not
calling will short up the anchor weve got ourselves a ship
sailors make their way down a rope ladder crowd onto the jolly mon
will pushes hard against the windlass to no avail
the anchor is too heavy for one man
a little help
gillette shrugs gestures to murtogg and mullroy
the three men throw their weight into the windlass and it turns
jacks pistol is on them the whole time
i cant believe hes doing this
the windless turns bringing mullroy into view
you didnt believe he was telling the truth either
the windless turns some more and theres gillette
over his shoulder to will do you have any idea boy what youre doing
another quarter turn no
jack and will crank a capstan raising the forward jib sail
it luffs and billows out
the huge ship inches forward slowly pulled by just the one sail
lookee there mate
norrington moves along concentrating on a manifest
alongside him is governor swann who glances over sees the tiny jolly mon headed toward them riding low in the water overloaded with sailors
beyond that the dauntless sails albeit slowly for open waters
commodore a moment
dammit man it appears someone is stealing your ship
norrington glances out at the bay
sure enough the dauntless is on the move
norrington takes a brass telescope from his belt opens it trains it on the main deck
he picks out will rash turner too rash
then spots jack at the wheel
lowers the telescope
that is without doubt the worst pirate i have ever seen
out in the open sea jack leans on the wheel relaxed not much sailing to do with a following wind
will looks back theyre coming
he points the sails of the interceptor fill out and the ship cuts through the water toward them norringtons smaller ship quickly comes alongside the slowmoving dauntless
its decks appear empty
grappling hooks are thrown and sailors draw the two ships together
norringtons men swarm across
search every cabin every hold down to the bilges
pull back away from the dauntless and past the railing of the interceptor where a single sentry stands watch and we find a soaked jack and will as they climb
up over the side of the smaller ship unseen
jack tackles the sentry from behind covers hi rmouth
can you swim
the man struggles can
jack removes his hand
of course sir
like a fish
i grew up summers living in dover with my uncle good
jack lifts the man up throws him overboard
quickly unties the ropes to the grappling hooks
will cranks the capstan bars raising the foresail norrington emerges from a gangway and sees his other ship moving away
back to the interceptor
but the distance is already too great
one brave sailor tries to swing across on a rope errol flynn style but falls short with a splash
jack waves and shouts across the distance thank you commodore for getting our ship ready to make way
wedve had a hard time of it by ourselves
norrington seethes but his order to gillette is measured raise the sails
the wind is quarter from astern by the time were underway well never catch them
we need only to come about to put them in range of the long nines
gillette looks surprised at the order but relays it
jackets off the cannons
to norrington we are to fire on our own ship
better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate
the steersman turns the wheel
the dauntless course does not change one whit
captain theres a problem
the steersman spins the wheel
it goes round and round with no signs of slowing
hes disabled the rudder chain sir
so it would seem
the interceptor dwindles with distance
gillette watches it go with some degree of admiration
hes got to be the best pirate ive ever seen
norrington reaches out stops the spinning ships wheel
so it would seem
the interceptor makes for the horizon line
a slow dissolve and with the time passage the ship is gone the sky turns a deep twilight blue with the fat white moon riding just above the horizon
suddenly the edge of a black sail cuts into the foreground accompanied by the roar of the wind and the snap of canvas elizabeth stalks the cabin
pintel enters carrying a black silk dress
youll be dining with the captain and he requests you wear this
tell the captain that i am disinclined to acquiesce to his request
happy he said you say that
he also said if that be the case youll be dining with the crew and youll be naked
angry elizabeth holds out her hand
pintels grin fades
hands it over fine
he exits pouting
elizabeth examines the dress barbossa enters followed by pirates carrying trays of food wine table setting etc
elizabeth stands at the small table in the dress lovely
maid or not it fits you
dare i ask the fate of its previous owner
now none of that
please dig in
the table is set
elizabeth sits cuts a tiny piece of meat eats it daintily
no need to stand on ceremony and no call to impress anyone
you must be hungry
elizabeth drops the pretense shes starving and begins to eat like it
barbossa watches her intently
try the wine
elizabeth does a huge swig she tears off a hunk of bread devours it
and the apples one of those next
she starts to bite into the apple stops
she is suddenly aware of barbossas gaze and that he is not eating
she shoves her plate away and takes the opportunity to palm her knife
oh there would be no sense in killing you miss turner
then why arent you eating
would that i could
he produces the medallion lets it dangle from his fingers
do you not know what this is then
its a pirate medallion
its a piece of the treasure of isla de muerta
elizabeth gives an infinitesimal shrug intrigued despite herself
ah so you dont know as much as you pretend
back when cortes was cutting a great bloody swath through the new world a high priest gave
him all the gold they had with one condition that he spare the peoples lives
of course cortes being cortes he didnt
nods hedve made a great pirate that one
barbossa stands moves to a shelf
puts a key to a medium sized polished wooden box the captains chest
so the priest with his dying breath called on the power of the blood of his people and put on the gold a curse
if anyone took so much as a single piece as he was compelled by greed by greed he would be consumed
inside the chest are charts some gold a sextant and a few pages of a mayan codex pieces of tree bark inscribed with mayan glyphs
barbossa removes them carefully sets them on the table
pours over them
within a day of leaving port for spain the treasure ship carrying the gold
something went wrong
the ship run aground every man aboard dead save one
he survived long enough to hide the gold ashore
beat over time the dark magic of the curse seeped into the place making it a cursed island
an island of death
isla de muerta
he looks up
elizabeth has been rapt involved in the story but feigns a dismissive attitude
thats all very interesting but i hardly believe in ghost stories any more
barbossa is angry
he stands sweeps the food off the table
you idiot girl
its no make believe
my crew and i we found the gold and we did more than take one piece we took it all
rich men we were and we spent it and traded it and gave it away in exchange for drink and food and pleasant company
but we found out the drink could not sate us and the food turned to ashes in our mouths and no amount of pleasant company could ease our torment
regains his composure we are cursed men miss turner condemned to be forever consumed by our own greed
gold calls to ub always and we are driven always to find more and add it to the treasure
barbossa picks up the priceless codex
crushes them in his fist
there is but one way to remove the curse
all of the scattered pieces of the treasure must be restored in full and the blood repaid
he throws the pages aside weve recovered every piece save for this
holds up the medallion and as for the blood
thats what we have you for
pleasant finally getting to his point and thats why theres no sense in killing you
elizabeth stares at him horrified
using the toe of his boot barbossa flips an apple up off the floor catches it extends it to elizabeth
elizabeth slowly reaches for the apple and then comes up out of her chair trying to run around barbossa they struggle briefly and then suddenly he shoves her away elizabeths
stolen knife is buried in barbossas chest to the hilt barbossa is completely unaffected
he opens his shirt to get a better look at the knife pulls it out with little effort
there is blood on the blade but none anywhere else
im curious after killing me what is it you were planning to do next
elizabeth backs away whirls and barrels out the door elizabeth comes to dead stop
she stares her jaw working trying to scream but unable to the pirate crew works at their stations coiling lines navigating the ship swabbing decks but where the moonlight falls
across their bodies they are nauqht but elizabeth turns away from the sight barbossa stands just inside the doorway out of the moonlight
he grabs her roughly by the shoulders and jerks her back around elizabeth shuts her eyes look
shakes her look
the moonlight shows us for what we really are
we are not among the living and so we cannot die he spins her back around to face him he leans forward putting his face in the moonlight turning it
into a gleaming skull with gold and silver teeth but neither are we dead
we have all the desires of the living but cannot satisfy them
ten years i have been parched of thirst and unable to quench it
ten years i have been starving to death and havent died
raises his hand and i have not felt anything for ten years
not the wind on my face nor the spray of the sea
reaches toward elizabeth nor the flesh of a woman
elizabeth flinches away from the skeletal hand
it drops away he takes a bottle of wine from the opened case beside the cabin door uncorks it with his teeth raises it youd best start believing in ghost
stories miss turner
because now youre in one
he tilts the bottle and drinks it runs over his jaw through his rib cage drenching his clothes
elizabeth darts around him back into the cabin and shuts the door
barbossa hurls the bottle away
elizabeth huddles in the far corner of the cabin terrified
the interceptor cuts across the waves
jack at the wheel will tightens a line moves back astern
will sharpens his sword with a whetstone shhhk shhhk for a man whose made an industry of avoiding boats youre a quick study
i worked passage from england as a cabin boy
an attempt at guile after my mother passed i came out here
looking for my father
is that so
jack says nothing
will has lost the patience for guile
im not a simpleton
at the jail it was only after you learned my name that you agreed to help
a smile since thats what i wanted i didnt press the matter
but now an accusation you knew my father
jack considers his reply settles on truth
i knew him
probably one of the few who knew him as william turner
most everyone just called him bill or bootstrap bill
and clever i never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him
when you were puzzling out that cell door it was like seeing his twin
angry thats not true
i swear you look just like him
its not true that my father was a pirate
figured you wouldnt want to hear it
he was a merchant marine
he was a respectable man who obeyed the law and followed the rules laughs you think your father is the only man who ever lived the glasgow life telling folk
one thing and then going off to do another
theres quite a few who come here hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life
and theyre all merchant marines
my father did not think of my mother his family as a burden
sure because he could always go pirating
my father was not a pirate
wills sword is out levelled at jack
jack gives him a disbelieving look sighs
put it away will
its not worth getting beat again
you didnt beat me
you ignored the rules of engagement
in a fair fight id kill you
then thats not much incentive for me to fight fair is it
he kicks a lever on a wench
the sail boom whips around and slams will in the chest sweeping him off the ship
his sword clatters onto the deck
will dangles above the water
jack slips a loop of rope around the wheel to hold the course
picks up the sword and pokes at will with it
will hand over hands away from the blade to the end of the boom
as long as youre just hanging there pay attention
must should do dont shall shall not those are just suggestions
there are only two absolute rules
ticks them off on his fingers what a man can do
and what a man can i t do
will looks away not interested
for instance you can accept that your father was a pirate and still a good man
or you cant
now me i can sail this ship to tortuga by myself
will looks alarmed but i cant just let you drown
jack swings the boom back in
will drops to the deck
jack holds the hilt of the sword out
will takes it
glares at jack considers what hell do next
jack watches him coolly
will turns and strides to his spot on the deck sits down and resumes sharpening his sword shhhk shhhk shhhk jack breathes silent sigh of relief
notices his hand is shaking he takes the wheel
oh did i forget to mention that
a dank and dirty port where the tides seem to have swept together the scum of the caribbean pirates privateers prostitutes thieves and drunkards
with its cantered rotting docks weatherbeaten buildings and odd assortment of livestock running free a donkey chickens etc
it is far less civilized than port royal
jack and will move through the crowd
a redheaded woman turns her head she has noticed jack
we need a crew
we can manage the ship between islands but the open sea thats another matter suddenly the redhead slaps jack hard
satisfied she turns and strides off
will ignores her
just do it quickly
rubbing his jaw dont worry
ive already got my quartermaster there
jack leads will toward a pub the faithful bride the emblem over the door a politically incorrect painting of a smiling woman holding a bouquet in her chained and manacled
jack pulls open the door will goes inside passing a pretty asian women coming out she sees jack and immediately slaps him cursing something in chinese
jack backs away jack closes the door on the woman joins will
they take in the place it is populated with a slightly higher class of scum
jack spots a bartender smiles moves forward and is suddenly decked by a waitress
this is anamaria tall strong tough she didnt spill a drink off her tray
you stole my boat
have you seen gibbs
i need to put together she slaps him again
will shakes his head heads for the bar
jack gets up
borrowed your boat
off her look without permission
anamaria charges jack backs away puts a table between them
she chases him around the table still carrying the tray
the jolly mon
where is it
at port royal
with the royal navy
that boat is my livelihood
youll get it back
or one better
a threat i will
away from them a patron calls for his food
anamaria scowls at jack moves away comes back for
one more jack
at the bar will has spoken to the bartender
jack arrives rubbing his chin
he knows gibbs
the bartender nods yes
then nods out back
then produces a water bucket from behind the bar
jack and will exchange a look and jack takes the bucket
a drunken man lays in the mud having a friendly conversation with two pigs
he wears an old tattered navy jacket
a sudden spray of water splashes across his face revealing this is old joshamee gibbs the man who told pirate stories to elizabeth when she was a child
he sputters and roars curse you for breathing you slack jawed idiot recognizes jack mothers love jack you know better than to wake a man when hes sleeping
its bad luck
well fortunately i know how to counter it
the man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition
aye thatll about do it
jack helps gibbs to his feet and then gibbs is hit with a second wave of water
will stands there with the bucket
blast it im already awake
that was for the smell
jack and gibbs sit at a table in the shadows a single candle illumining them speaking in hushed voices
will is away from them at the door hand on sword keeping a look out
a tankard is set down
gibbs lifts it to take a swig just the one
he takes a dainty sip
make it ast then
now whats the nature of this venture of yours
first have you found me a crew
oh theres a hard tale jack
most of the decent pirates in town wont sail with you seem to think youre a jinx
now where i wonder would they have gotten that idea
gibbs evades answering by taking a long sip
jack leans forward
gibbs leans forward
im going after the black pearl
gibbs straightens up like hes been hit
he reaches for the drink as if to down it but then sets it back down
he leans forwards again
jack has not moved
ilm going after the black pearl
i know where its going to be and im going to take it
jack its a fools errand youve heard the tales they tell about the pearl
aye and thats why i know where its going to be and thats why i know what barbossa is up to
all i need is a crew
shakes his head a fools errand
not if the fool has something barbossa wants
something he needs
and youve got that have you
angle on jack as he smiles enigmatically and shifts his eyes behind him will still on guard glares a sailor away from the table
back there guarding the door is the son of old bootstrap bill turner
gibbs eyes widen over the edge of the tankard
peers at will
then smiles with more missing teeth than good ones
well lookee there
ill allow you may be onto something jack
considers nods theres bound to be sailors on this rock crazy as you
ill find some men
gibbs downs the drink slams the tankard on the table
will reacts to the sound draws both sword and dagger kicks over a table for cover and whirls on anyone who moves
kids a bit of a stick isnt he
that he is
on the docks a disheveled motley and weatherbeaten group of about a dozen swabs stand in a ragged line up
feast your eyes capn
all of em good sea faring men faithful hands before the mast every one worth his salt sotto making his point and crazy to boot
jack holds up a hand enough
he moves down the line gibbs at his side
then he notices anamaria in line dressed like a man he raises an eyebrow
you owe me a boat
jack nods continues
one sailor is quite fat another thin and sickly
jack is not happy with his choices
he stops in front of cotton a short sailor with a large colorful parrot on his shoulder
jack raises an eyebrow
cotton here is mute sir
poor devil had his tongue cut out cotton opens his mouth to show this jack grimaces
so he went and trained the parrot to do the talking for him nobody knows how
nobody knows the parrots name neither so we just call it cottons parrot
jack decides to test this
do you have the courage and fortitude to follow orders and stay true in the face danger and almost certain death
cotton lifts the parrot off his shoulder raises it wind in your sails
wind in your sails
mostly that seem to mean yes
cotton nods vigorously lowers the parrot and it goes silent
jack shakes his head
that goes for the rest of you
danger and near certain death
turns away for we are to sail for the isla de muerta to rescue the daughter of governor swann
an equal share of the reward shall be jack hears movement looks back several potential crew members back away in fright first one then another turn and run followed by
soon just a half dozen are left including cotton with parrot and anamaria
shut up before you lose them all
these are the only ones worth having
glances at the sky and were going to need them a flash of lightening and the crack of thunder
the canvas of every sail is stretched taut
the ship rocks as it drops into the valley of huge swell climbs up the other side
on board the new crew members scurry about their tasks pulling lines and trimming sails
excellent sailors it takes everything they have to keep the ship afloat
anamaria is at the helm
gibbs staggers along the deck
that fool will have us lose the canvas and the masts besides
on jack a roaring wind blowing back his hair eyes intent on their course
gibbs climbs the tilted deck toward him
werd best drop canvas sirl she can hold a bit longer
the wind picks up howling
shouts whats in your head to put you in such a fine mood
shouts were catching up
jack turns back to the sea enjoying himself
gibbs stares at him like hes a crazy man
the sound of rain pounds down on the deck above then suddenly stops
elizabeth moves to the stern windows looks out at the rolling sea below no escape there
she hears the sound of a vqice calling gazes up wondering high on the main mast twigg cups his hands to his face calls down isla de muerta
isla de muerta off the port bow
on deck barbossa moves to the rail
the storm clouds are breaking up
on the horizon is a dark ominous shape isla de muerta
mostly sheer unfriendly cliffs that shoot straight into the water
it is surrounded by a slate grey sea
barbossa grasps the rail with both hands his expression a mixture of loathing and fear
jacoby approaches hesitant
bring her in not too close
i wont brave the reef not until high tide
we lay anchor before dark
jacoby nods backs away
barbossa continues to stare that is if it first doesnt sink back down to hell from where it came
the interceptor on open waters glorious her white sails set wing to wing
close on jacks compass cradled in both hands
jack leans over and studies it almost like hes praying
on the compass the face shows old fashioned rose petal style direction markers below a quivering indicator that settles on southeast
bear three points starboard
anamaria turns the wheel adjusting course
the ship leans into the new direction
jack looks down on the compass where the indicator spins reverses settles on northeast
six points port
anamaria frowns but follows the order turns the wheel back and the ship responds
will works on deck coiling a rope but he watches jack and anamaria clearly not happy
gibbs hobbles up
left handed ropes are coiled against the sun or its bad luck
twirls a finger anty clockwise
gibbs takes over the task
the ship shifts course again
will has had enough
how do we expect to find an island no one can find with a compass that doesnt work
now lad just because it dont point north dont mean it dont work
voice low that compass gives bearings to the isla de muerta wherever it may lie
moves closer so
whats the story on the pistol
gibbs settles in happy to have a willing listener
ill tell lee
now jack sparrow has an honest streak in him and thats where the whole problem starts
this was when he was captain of the black pearl what
he never told me that
ah hes learned then
plays things more close to the vest
see jack was a cartographer back in old england
somehow i he came by the money to commission the pearl
hired himself a crew promised each man an equal share
lowers his voice so theyre forty days out and the first mate says everythings an equal share that should mean the location of the island too
so jack gave up the bearings
shakes his head that night there was mutiny
gibbs voice is a whisper now so will has to lean closer
jack gave hisself up for the sake of his loyal crewmen
he was marooned on an island left there to die
how did he get off the island
loud i didnt
will and gibbs jump
jack is right there beside them
my bodys still there rotting away and i am but a ghost
will and gibbs arent sure what to make of that
how did you get off the island
ah thats a dark and unpleasant tale best left untold
he starts off
wait what about the pistol
when a pirate is marooned will hes given a pistol with a single shot
no good for hunting or surviving really
but after three weeks of starvation and thirst the option of that pistol begins to look good
jack lets this sink in
he pulls out the pistol raises it
but i survived
and i still have that single shot
its meant for one man
my mutinous first mate barbossa
jack shoots a glance at will nods and moves away
on barbossa face upturned
no expression in his eyes
around him a group of pirates elizabeth among them stand as still as stones in front of a dark cave opening
their faces look upward their total lack of movement disconcerting
above the cave on a hillock the pirate koehler gazes out toward the horizon
slowly he transforms head to toe from pirate to skeleton the moon has climbed free of the storm clouds rising large
and full on the horizon
the skeleton turns moonrise captain
first night of full
to the pirates be mindful of pits and crevasses
he takes a torch
moves into the cave
the pirates follow
the group keeps together under the firelight
the path leads between boulders on a slope downhill
from the echoes and shadows its clear the cave system must be huge
elizabeth glances over the torches illumine caverns off to the side and just the edge of a mound of coins
clearly there is more but the rest is lost in darkness
twigg gazing upward in wonder moves a few feet away from the group
barbossa grabs him as he nears a chasm
fall down there youd die and miss judgement day for not even the lord himselfll come look for you here
barbossa lets go and moves on descending down twisting and turning but always down cotton pulls a sail line looks out sees something
he lifts the parrot off his shoulder strokes it along the back
indeed the faint outline of isla de muerta is in the distance on the port side
will stands excited jumps onto the rigging for a better look
but anamaria at the helm stares at cotton and the parrot
how does he do that
theyll be anchored on the lee side
haul your wind and keep to the weather of the island flickering torchlight
pirates stoop low to enter a cavern and revealed is the spectacular treasure of isla de muerta overflowing chests of coins gold and silver ingots jewelry objects d art jade
and ivory brightly colored silks furniture jewels and pearls mirrors and swords anything and everything of value that might be carried by ship is here
the pirates move through elizabeth cant help but gaze in wonder
the curse drove you to gather this
and not a bit of it any use to us only hoarded
but it will drive us no longer
elizabeth pauses staring at herself in a jewel encrusted mirror and then is pushed along by the pirates
the interceptor lies at anchor in the distance
closer jack and will row away from the larger vessel in a small longboat toward the rocky shore
the rush of a waterfall grows louder
will looks ahead of them is a black cave mouth right at water level
on whether the stories are all true
if they are thats a waterfall that spills over at high tide with a short drop to an underground lagoon
if not by now the moving water tugs on the longboat and they are sucked in well too late
the boat rushes forward plunges into the darkness the longboat takes a harrowing drop over a short waterfall
but then lands safely in a gorgeous underwater lagoon floats lazily toward a sandy shore
chalk one up for the stories
will leaps out into the water pulls the boat ashore the pirate group reaches the end of a small chamber of mostly jewels and pearl piled around a large bed
and then emerge into the largest cavern of all also crammed with treasure including several mountains of gold coins that reach the ceiling
treasure everywhere except for one spot in the center
a hole in the ceiling lets in a column of moonlight which illumines a stone chest lid pushed back decorated with carved aztec glyphs filled with gold coins identical to
a sharp stone knife lies on top
in front of it buried in the sand is a skeleton and this one doesnt look like its going to move ever again judging by the sword in its back
a crab scurries away from it as the group approaches
here we stand before the cursed treasure of cortez himself
won by blood it demands blood in return
all eyes turn onto elizabeth
pintle takes the stone knife from the chest approaches her
elizabeth shrinks back but is held by two other pirates
grabs her by the wrist
she turns her head away shuts her eyes
pintle raises the knife
and then very carefully daintily uses just the sharp tip of the knife to just prick
one tiny red drop of blood appears and drips down onto the medallion
elizabeth opens her eyes surprised
what did you expect
were all gentlemen here right and proper
the pirates laugh
barbossa takes the medallion grins at elizabeth
you know the first thing im going to do after the curse is lifted
grins eat a whole bushel of apples
barbossa approaches the chest shining in the beam of moonlight
what was begun by blood let blood now end
he tosses the gold medallion onto the others
the pirates tense waiting expectant
a long beat
they all look at each other look at themselves
did it work
i dont feel no different
how do we tell
barbossa frowns draws his pistol and shoots the pirate next to him jacoby square in the chest
jacoby reacts in shock grabs his chest
but doesnt die
youre not dead
realizes he shot me
it didnt work
the curse is still upon us
barbossa searches his mind for an answer
turns to elizabeth
what was his name
grabs her roughly was your father william turner
elizabeth takes time to smile before answering no
the pirates cry out in alarm
barbossa gathers himself getting his rage under steely control
wheres his child
the child that sailed from england eight years ago the child who is the real owner of that medallion the child in whose veins flows the blood of william turner
barbossa slaps her hard across the face sending her sprawling
to pintel you brought us the wrong person
she had the medallion
shes the right age
she said her name was turner
to barbossa you brought us here for nothing
barbossa whirls on him if you had sailed with morgan for ten years like i have youd know not to question me
elizabeth sits up watching the pirates argue for a moment unnoticed
suddenly a scabbard comes down right above her
startled elizabeth looks up will is at the top of a mound of coins reaching down with his scabbard for her to grab onto
elizabeth quickly leans forward takes the bloodied medallion from the pile
reaches back grabs the scabbard
will pulls her up if any coward here dare challenge me let him speak
any more talk ill chain ye to a cannon and send ye to the watery depths
a sound catches his attention coins falling
he looks up sees will and elizabeth at the top of the treasure stack
atop the stack will grabs a large shield flings them forward the two ride down the mountain of coins on the far side slide through a small opening behind them
loose coins from their slide come down in an avalanche sealing the entrance
elizabeth jumps up silver platter in hand ready to swing jack catches her before she can do any damage
they recognize each other
youre in league with barbossa
no im rescuing you
elizabeth cant comprehend that one
will gains his footing in the rubble
were here to rescue you
sounds of pursuit approaching its going badly
they race off toward a bit of moonlight the three climb up a dark crevasse that leads out onto the island
will takes elizabeths hand helps her
im glad we got here in time
truthfully you were a bit late
the trick isnt getting here its getting away
as if on cue they hear the yells of pirates coming closer
they take off the three race through the rocks the sounds of pursuit close behind
suddenly jack stops
this wont work
a quick decision ill stay behind and fight them
you go on
will and elizabeth stare at him
ill lead them away
the sounds are closer
go to the opposite end of the island and signal the ship
ill keep em busy
are you sure
jack this is not something you have to do
when youve led the kind of life i have there are debts that must be paid
maybe i can balance the scales a little
will nods hesitates
gives jack his sword now jack has two
one for each hand
elizabeth gives him a quick kiss
will and elizabeth race away and are gone
jack watches them for a moment turns to face the pirates
he sticks the two swords in the ground crossed
leans casually against a rock
a group of pirates round a corner cutlasses drawn ready to fight but jack raises his hand
i invoke the right of parlay according to the code of the brethren set down by the pirates morgan and bartholomew
jack stands before barbossa surrounded by pirates
jack has a wide smile on his face and barbossa doesnt like it
im inclined to kill you now jack sparrow without so much as a word if you dont lose that grin from your face
jacks smile remains
barbossa puts a hand to his cutlass the womans blood didnt work did it
i know whos blood you need to end the curse
say the name or i slit your throat
no you wont
pintel steps forward puts a blade to jacks throat
jacks smile widens
pintel grins no dont kill him
surprised pintel lowers his cutlass
jacks expression hasnt changed
allow me the humor of listening to your terms
i have something you want more than anything
the way to free you from the curse of the treasure
you have something i want more than anything
laughs oh thats fine
and just how do you expect this to work
you give me the pearl
then i tell you who you need
barbossa stares at him incredulous
thats your offer
you sailing away nice and pretty with the black pearl and all i have is a name
im supposed to
the pirates laugh
im a man of my word
the pirates laugh louder
you see ive got this honest streak in me in its own way a sort of curse
oh and theres the fact that you have no choice
ill torture it out of you
you left me on a desert island what worse can you do
jack is still smiling intentionally smug now
barbossa sees his options dwindling begins to pace
ill throw you in prison
wait as long as you like
youre setting me up for a double cross you with the ship and me with nothing more than your word
lets say i tell you the wrong person
what would you do
track you down and he sees where jack is headed
and if i tell you the truth you become mortal and you wont come near me because you know id kill you
the pirates are amazed at how the tide has turned barbossa has gone past considering the idea and might even do it
jack i dont trust you and thats a fact
never trust a smiling man you can lay to that
see thats where were different
i trust you
to do what it takes to get what you want
youre playing this as close to the edge as any man ill give you that
decides smiles we might just have to sign articles you and i
jack youre a pirate at heart thats certain
if this fool plan is to work well need the medallion and that means catching the ship which brought em here
jack is caught completely off guard
for the first time his smile fades
what you dont have the medallion
that fool woman took it
you be careful around her jack shes pretty enough shell steal your heart but pure evil inside
ill watch my back
set up mr
sparrows quarters nice and fine
in the brig
to jack a smile meaning no disrespect of course
jack nods and is taken away
barbossa stares after him not hiding his mistrust
at full sail headed out to sea
gibbs glances at elizabeth and will talking alone on the forecastle shakes his head
two women on board
a man dont have to be superstitious to know thats trouble
elizabeth holds the medallion and finishes her tale you were in danger
so i took the medallion
and ive kept it ever since
they thought i was you that they needed my blood
and it didnt work
she hands him the medallion
why would my father send this to me
to keep it away from them
no pirate would sail to london for fear of execution dock
if i had known anticipating him then we never would have met
they hold each others gaze a moment
will turns away first leans on the rail
looks out to sea back the direction they came
i cant believe he would make such a sacrifice for us
i guess you can never truly know someone elses heart
will glances at her and nods
at the helm gibbs peers forward scanning the horizon
there is a tiny island in front of them
shift your heading steer clear of that island
fifteen degrees starboard
on the aft deck cotton concentrates on his work securing a halyard
suddenly cottons parrot flaps its wings takes off lands on the starboard bulwark squawking dead men tell no tales
dead men tell no tales
dead men tell no tales
cotton looks up on the horizon following black sails
gibbs and anamaria appear and see the ship
can we outrun them
not a chance
make for the reef
miles of blue water
the interceptor tacks leaving a long white wake
the black pearl matches it gaining
barbossa and pintel eye the interceptor two hounds chasing the fox
whats he doing
is he going to run her aground
the black pearl is now close behind the interceptor and the interceptor is headed for the island
drop the forward anchor
a sailor at the stern of the ship pulls a release and the ships anchor races down into the water the metal chain jumping and twisting on deck
the chain stops and the sailor locks it with its forward momentum and the anchor down the interceptor to turn quickly pivoting around the anchor
barbossa and pintel watch as the huge ship brings its cannons to bear right in front of them
prepare to come about
but for now the interceptor has the advantage and takes it its cannons boom and cannonballs rain down
jack sees what he can out the porthole
in the cell with him is twigg acting as a guard
dont hit my ship
i mean kill the lying scoundrel to twigg im a little conflicted here
twigg just stares
elizabeth watches as the black pearl comes about and then there is the low loud rumble of two dozen cannons firing as one
the interceptor is hit
a barrage of shots follow most find their mark
sailors dive for cover leaving their cannons clearly they are overmatched
strike your colors you bloody cockroaches
another round of fire barbossa shows no mercy
looks like they mean to send us under
there shes raised the jolly roger upside down
anamaria gibbs cotton even elizabeth all know what this means
he looks to gibbs for an explanation its a signal
if we resist it wont just be death
therell be torture as well
were not going to just surrender
gibbs that we are
the black pearl fires again a double ball shot with a chain connecting the two
it hits the main mast dead ani a cracking splinting sound as it breaks falls to the deck
barbossa moves his ship alongside preparing to board
we can at least fight we might be able to kill a few will itll go worse for us for elizabeth especially if we fight
will stares and nods
but his expression is still defiant
the deck slants the ship is sinking
pirates swarm across on ropes and take control of the interceptor
the top masts of the h
interceptor sink into the smooth crystal waters of the caribbean as will and elizabeth held by pirates are brought before barbossa and see that jack stands beside him manacled
gibbs anamaria and cotton and the other crewmembers huddle together
barbossas wrath falls on elizabeth
welcome back miss
last time on board you played me right clever make pretending and all
i hope your stay this time is more pleasant
boys show her some hospitality
he shoves her into a group of pirates they yell their approval
she is pushed from one to another
this goads will to action
he head butts the pirate behind him grabs a pistol waves it at the pirates
she goes free
will leaps onto the ships rail
he steadies himself with a hand on the rigging
points the pistol at barbossa
whats in your head boy
youve got one shot and we cant die
he leans out over the ocean
jack pushes forward
will dont do anything stupid
dont say anything stupid my name is will turner the son of bootstrap bill turner
his blood runs in my veins
raises the gun to his head you need my blood
and on my word i will pull this trigger and sink all the way down to davy jones locker
pintel squints at will the pirates murmur surprise
its true hes the spittin image of old bootstrap
even talks the same
jack drops his head
barbossa grins at him
looks like youre back to having nothing to offer
and hers got old bills courage
a curse on him and you
barbossa steps forward
enough of that
to will name your terms
elizabeth goes free
we got that part
and the crew
free and unharmed
i f you agree
i will remain with you
barbossa considers his crew waits
you have my word as a gentleman of fortune will you cant trust him
you must swear by the holy bible
you have my word then on the good book i do swear and the lord spare my worthless soul
barbossa crosses himself as do many of his men
will lowers the gun
steps down the pirates surround him
they snatch away the pistol
take your captives belowdecks
chain them in the galley and teach em how to row
gibbs anamaria cotton and the rest are led away under guard
barbossa looks out to sea toward the islet
thats the very same island we made jack governor of on our last trip
nods when you sail the open sea as long as i you learn to trust the signs fate sends your way
dejected amen to that
im a man of my word and youre to be set free right quick
loudly men break out the plank
a cheer goes up from the pirates
will realizes what barbossa intends to do struggles with his captors
you gave your word
quiet boy or youll lose your tongue
those as know me know i wouldnt cross my word and bring down bad luck on the ship
nods i agreed to set them free
i didnt say when
the black pearl lies at anchor closer now to the islet
jack wrists still bound stands in the classic walking the plank pose
elizabeth is next in line
pirates crowd the ships rail to watch
its pure evil to make a captain walk the plank of his own ship twice in one lifetime
no good can come of it
that reef is less than a league distant
its a square deal all around and you cant hope for better
someone needs to cut these bonds then
barbossa smiles shows a pistol
points it at jack
youd best take a swim jack
the last time you did this you left me a pistol with one shot
the pirates mutter agreement
thats proper sir according to the code
by the powers youre right
turns around wheres jacks pistol
whos got it
bring it forward
a gentleman might give us two pistols seeing as there are two of us this time
a pirate hands jacks pistol to barbossa
tell you what
ill give you one pistol and let you be the gentleman an shoot the lady and starve to death yourself
grins that is presuming youre not both drownded
the pirates laugh
barbossa tosses jack the pistol but over his head and down into the water with a splash
so how did you get off that island anyway
you can go to your grave not knowing
jack glares at barbossa
then hes prodded with a cutlass takes a step out
reaches the end of the plank steps off
jack plunges down into the water
appears on the surface floundering struggles to stay afloat
will and elizabeth exchange helpless looks there is nothing they can do
the ladys next
but first ill be wanting that dress back if you please
then strips it off leaving her in a silk slip
she throws it at him
here it will go well with your black heart
barbossa indicates the plank
i will not walk into the ocean
youll have to throw me in
barbossa raises an eyebrow grins nods
have at her lads
the pirates rush to comply
lift her up toss her over the rail with a scream she falls we follow elizabeth amid foam and bubbles as she plunges down through the water
blue and clear with streaks of sunlight cutting down bright coral and tropical fish and a lovely young woman in a silk dress
if it werent for the mortal danger the scene could be described as gorgeous
elizabeth spots jack below her now sinking struggling
she swims down
unties his bonds
elizabeth starts for the surface
inexplicably jack swims the other way further down into the depths
elizabeth breaks the surface looks around
and then finally jack appears sucking in air
he shows what he went after his pistol
he tucks it into his shirt
you went back for that
we need to head for the reef
she starts swimming
the black pearl is already underway he stares at it
thats the second time ive had to watch that man sail away with my ship
he turns away and swims after elizabeth
close on the surf line
elizabeths feet leave prints in the sand
and then meet up with matching footprints she made earlier going in the same direction
she has walked all the way around the island
not all that big is it
jack lays on the beach
he has dismantled his pistol the parts ball and powder dry on his scarf
has it changed since the last time you were here
the trees are taller
jack checks to see if the pistol parts are dry they are
he sets about re assembling and loading his pistol
i hope you have no intention of using that
jack has finished putting his pistol back together
he shoves it in his belt walks off
ask me again in a few weeks
elizabeth cant believe it
we have to get off this island immediately
dont be thinking im not already working on it
he climbs up toward a clump of palm trees
digs for something beneath the sand
he finds it a large iron ring
what is that
is there a boat under there
jack heaves the trap door up and over revealing a pit
inside are barrels and bottles of rum
all covered with dust and cobwebs long abandoned
jacks face falls
how will this help us get off the island
it wont and so we wont
he jumps down into the pit cracks open a bottle of rum
takes a swig
you did it before
last time last time i was here a grand total of three days
last time the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by and i bartered passage off
but from the looks of this theyve long beenout of business and so that wont be happening again
takes another swig we probably have your friend norrington to thank for that
so thats it
thats the secret grand adventure of the infamous jack sparrow
you spent three days on the beach drinking rum
welcome to the caribbean love
he gathers up a few bottles heads for the beach
you should look at our contretemps this way weve got shade trees thank the lord
weve got some food on the trees thank the lord again
and weve got rum praise the lord
we can stay alive a month maybe more
keep a weather eye open for passing ships and our chances are fair
will doesnt have a month
weve got to do something to help him
hoists the bottle heres luck to you will turner
he drinks and defiantly returns elizabeths angry gaze
but then turns away sits down
dont be thinking im happy about this elizabeth
but i see no use in wailing and gnashing my teeth over that which i can do nothing about
not when you can drink instead at least
jack tosses her a bottle
it goes down rough but it goes down and the second swig goes down easier
comes to a decision
she unseals the bottle takes a swig
they sit in silence for a bit
and you will call me miss swann
jack toasts her you got it
elizabeth studies her bottle
gives jack a sidelong glance
back to her bottle under her breath drink up me hearties yo ho
what was that
elizabeth smiles something funny miss swann
im reminded of a song i learned as a child
a song about pirates
i know a lot of songs about pirates but none id teach a child
lets hear it
back in england we didnt know a thing about pirates really
they seemed so romantic and daring jack likes the way that sounds
looks at him that was before i met one of course
now i must hear this song
an authentic pirate song
have at it
with a bit more to drink i might
more to drink
he gathers two more bottles tosses one to her
she drops her half finished bottle to catch it
opens it takes a sip
elizabeth clears her throat begins to sing self consciously becoming stronger as she goes on
we pillage we plunder we rifle we loot drink up me hearties yo ho
she gestures for him to drink
we kidnap and ravage and we dont give a hoot drink up me hearties yo ho the middle of the night
a fire blazes
jack and elizabeth are roaring drunk arm in arm singing the song all the way up to the stars yo ho yo ho a pirates life for me
yo ho yo ho its a pirates life for me
i love this song
sings yo ho yo ho a pirates life for me
were beggars and blighters neer do well cads drink up me hearties yo ho
gives it a touch of irish ballad aye but were loved by our mums and our dads
drink up me hearties yo ho
they hoist their bottles but only jack drinks
he drains the bottle then tosses it away
when i get the black pearl back im going to teach it to the whole crew and well sing it all the time
youll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the spanish main
elizabeth salutes the idea with her bottle
jack doesnt have a bottle to salute back
she hands him hers
he drinks then settles shakily to the ground
elizabeth sits beside him
not just the spanish main
the whole ocean
the whole world
wherever we want to go we go
thats what a ship is you know
not just a keel and a hull and a deck and sails
thats what a ship need
but what a ship is what the black pearl really is
elizabeth lays her head on his shoulder
jack it must be so terrible for you to be trapped here on this island all over again
the company is better than last time
and the scenery has definitely improved
im not sure ive had enough rum to allow that kind of talk
weve got a few bottles left
and weve yet to tap the kegs
elizabeth shrugs with a sleight but promising smile
she picks up the empty bottle from the ground holds it up
to the black pearl
they tap the bottles together
elizabeth feigns a drink as he chugs
he taps his bottle against her again
she laughs feigns another drink close on jacks face dead asleep lying in the sunlight
his nose twitches
a bit of smoke drifts by
his nose twitches again
his eyes open
jack groans and sits up
he rubs his head looks over all of the foliage in the middle of the island is on fire
smoke rises high up into the clear blue sky
jack leaps to his feet
he sees elizabeth as she pours out the last of the rum dowsing a scrub brush at the base of a palm tree
it goes up in flames
she rolls the barrel forward it starts to burn merrily
jack cant believe his eyes
what are you doing
youve burned our food the shade the rum
yes the rum is gone
she wipes her hands together
one of the rum barrels in the fire explodes
one because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men into scoundrels
two she points to the sky
that signal is over a thousand feet high which means it can be seen for two hundred leagues in every direction
the entire royal navy is out to sea looking for me do you think there is even a chance they could mass it
you you burned up the island for a one time chance at being spotted
elizabeth turns toward the sea
just you wait captain
in an hour maybe two keep a weather eye open and youll be seeing white sails on that horizon
she sits down determined
shields her eyes scans the water waiting searching
jack is speechless
he throws up his hands stalks up the sand dune just to get away from her
at the crest of the dune jack stops and stares incredulous
we come around to see what he is looking at past jack anchored the other side of the island white sails glorious against the turquoise waters is the h
a longboat is already being rowed toward them
jack shakes his head
theyll be no living with her after this
norrington gives elizabeth a hand disembarking from the raised long boat
elizabeth im relieved youre safe
re jack clap him in irons
and behind his back this time
commodore you cant do that
youre speaking up for him again
he can locate isla de muerta but i doubt hell be willing to help us from the brig
shes right we had time to get to know each other
we are bound for port royal not isla de muerta
the pirates have taken will your father is frantic with worry
our mission was to rescue you and return home
that is what we shall do
turners fate is regrettable
but so was his decision to engage in piracy
norrington think about it
the black pearl its captain and crew
the last pirate threat in the caribbean
how can you pass that up
by remembering that i serve others not only myself
commodore i beg you please do this
as a wedding gift
i am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition i rescue mr
not as a condition a request
to gillette free mister sparrow and prepare to come about
hell give you our heading
gillette unlocks jacks manacles
jack raises an eyebrow
crew men lead jack toward the bridge
sailors go about their tasks and the ship begins its slow turn
elizabeth i hereby withdraw my proposal
i know now where your heart truly lies
elizabeth looks at norrington seeing him in a new light
and now i know
where yours does as well
they gaze at each other for a moment
norrington looks away
you may seclude yourself in my cabin
im afraid we do not have any ladies clothing aboard
then i can wear mens clothing
that would hardly be proper
well i am not going to stay hidden in a some cabin i suppose its going to be heaving bosoms and bare ankles for the remainder of the voyage
norrington is exasperated but then cant help but grin this is exactly why he loves her
she grins back at him shes not going to change
murtogg take our guest below and find her some trousers and a shirt
elizabeth smiles allows herself to be escorted away
norrington watches her go
then turns his gaze to the sea
pintel enters the cell
it appears empty but thats because will is hanging from the rafters trying to shove up the ceiling planks with his legs
that aint going to work
thats the gun deck above yea will drops lightly to the deck
suddenly what happened to william turner
ah william turner
he threw in with us after we relieved jack sparrow of his captaincy but turned out it never sat well with him particularly after we found cortes treasure and its
he thought we deserved to be cursed for leaving ol jack to the fate we did
thats why he sent off a piece of the treasure to you as it were so it would never be recovered and so cursed we remain
and then he ran
and hes hiding out someplace where you havent been able to find him
thats a nice thought to be sure and i wager your da wishes hed thought it hisself
see what hed done didnt sit too well with captain barbossa
so he chained a cannon to his legs and dumped him over
will reacts with shock at the account of his fathers fate
yep last i saw of bootstrap bill was his face looking up as he sank down to the crushing black oblivion of davy jones locker
sighs it was only after we found out we needed his blood to solve the curse
thats what you call ironic
barbossa appears behind pintel flanked by several other pirates
he regards will for a moment then bring him
jack goes to the rail and waits pretending to look out at the sea
elizabeth dressed in sailors clothes to excellent effect joins him
you didnt tell commodore norrington everything
nor did you i noticed
he might delay the rescue
and that would be too late
these men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed
i have a plan
if it succeeds then any battle will be decidedly brief
and one sided
whats your plan
isla de muerta lay dark and menacing on the horizon
elizabeth below decks
i will not compromise your safety
she starts to speak he turns away
lieutenant escort elizabeth to my quarters and make sure she stays there
norrington gazes through his spyglass at the island
jack watches with some amusement as elizabeth is escorted away
i dont like the situation mister sparrow
the island is riddled with caves
i will not put my men at a disadvantage
funny i was thinking along those lines
how about you let me go in alone and while youre setting up an ambush ill trick the pirates out to you
you would do that
they left me stranded
what have you got to lose
looks at him nothing i wouldnt be please to be rid of
smiles i knew youd listen to reason
torches are lit
barbossa leads will guarded by pintel and a band of pirates into the caves
a long boat is prepared to be lowered over the side
jack wraps his pistol securely in an oilskin pouch
that chart i drew up get you past the reefs
if youre steersmans good enough that is
ill be at the wheel myself
ill slip in talk them into to come out and youll be free to blow holy high heaven the whole lot of them
the crewmen release the lines and the boat drops the pirate group moves deeper into the caves
will moves along unwillingly
no reason to fret
its just a prick of the finger and a few drops of blood
turner blood doesnt flow pure in his veins
grins best play it safe and spill it all
i guess there is a reason to fret
the dauntless drifts into the lagoon
norrington and his men prepare to go ashore
h lit by torchlight
will notices a crack runs between the floor and the wall of the cave widening into a ravine
you could fall in and still be wondern when youll hit dirt
will makes a decision
he intentionally stumbles
pintel shoves him forward will continues forward grabs the pirate in front of him swings him into the wall of the cave
catches the pirates torch and uses it to ward off the others
you deserve to be cursed and remain cursed
he steps to one side and drops into the ravine
the wall of the ravine becomes a loose gravel slope will hits it and tumbles down disappears into black
a pox on him and his father and the whole damnable line
elizabeth looks out the captains small porthole sees boats laden with navy men headed for shore
she turns away from the porthole wishing there was something she could do
suddenly there is a flutter at the window cottons parrot is there
drink up me hearties yo ho
drink up me hearties yo ho
the bird flutters off elizabeth races to the porthole and then to the stern window to see it flyaway
she looks down and there fastened to the stern of the ship is a small rowboat
will races forward turning this way and that
he sees a light ahead heads for it turns a corner and runs straight into jack
do you have any idea where youre going
these caves magnify sound
just follow me
norrington and men land on the beach and spread out
they silently take up positions around the main cave entrance
jack leads will out of a narrow passage and stops staring
will is a few steps behind
are you certain this is the right way
its the right way
will join him and see what jack is staring at treasure piled on treasure sparkling glowing seemingly endless
at the center is the moonlit clearing and the stone aztec chest
thank you jack sparrow
the jump barbossa is standing right behind them flanked by his men
the trio whirl to run more pirates emerge from hiding
nearly the entire crew of the black pearl is there
the pirates grab will and jack
will struggles but jack does not fight at all
you couldnt have led him back more directly if you knew exactly where you were going
he laughs and moves toward the stone chest
the pirates follow dragging will and jack with them
you did know where you were going
you did lead us directly to them
jacks silence confirms it why
jack looks away as will is manhandled toward the chest
barbo sa steps up to him becoming skeletal in the moonlight and puts the medallion around wills neck
he picks up the stone knife
what was begun by blood let blood now end
he raises the knife to wills throat you dont want to be doing that
barbossa pretends to think about his words
no i really think i do
shrugs all right then
that makes barbossa pause
he steps out of the moonlight
why dont i want to do this
because right about now the h
dauntless is lying in wait in the harbor
and its guns and crew will cut you and your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves
a buzz of apprehension sweeps through the pirates
do you believe him
indicates will but him i believe
he is genuinely angry
youve no hope of surviving norringtons attack
that is if youre mortal
whatre you suggesting
jack shakes off the hands holding him strolls toward barbossa will and the chest of coins
dont kill the boy yet
wait for a more opportune moment
will glares listening to every word he says
jack scoops up a handful of coins from the chest
drops the coins one by one back into the chest like after youve killed
of norringtons men
i cant help wondering jack why youre being so helpful and all
last time you did that it didnt end well for you
the situation has changed
see after youre done with the royal navy youll have a bit of a problem the h
there youll be with two lovely ships on your hands and what to do
of course youll decide you deserve the bigger one and whos to argue
the dauntless a first rate ship of line and with it you can rule the seas
beat but if youre captain of the dauntless whos left for the black pearl
jack smiles and spreads his hands me
i sail for you as part of your fleet i give you fifteen percent of my plunder and you get to introduce yourself at tea parties and brothels as commodore
sticks out his hand do we have an accord
barbossa licks his lips
now you can take care of the dauntless right
are you up for it
the pirates yell to the affirmative
pintel select five men to stay here
take the rest of the men out
not through the caves
jacks expression falters this he hadnt planned for
aye for us there is
moonlight shines down into the shallow waters brightening coral sparkling over the rippled sand floor
suddenly all the fish scatter
briefly the waters are empty
and then figures appear in the distance seeming to waver in the shifting current
they scuffle forward kicking up clouds of sand the figures resolve into the skeleton pirates moving silently across the lagoon floor swords glinting
the tatters of their clothing drift in the water
their skull heads are fixed in an endless grin
the lead pirate glides forward and stops next to a huge iron anchor twice his height even buried halfway into the sand
a heavy chain with barrel sized links climbs up toward the surface a shadow falls across the lead pirate he transforms and we see that it is pintel
he looks up above the heavy chain leads to the giant bottom hull of the h
dauntless silhouetted by moonlight
the huge shift drifts again spilling moonlight below and the pirates gathered around the anchor are once again skeletons staring with upturned faces
the pintel skeleton puts a knife between his teeth starts to crawl up the iron rings
other pirates crowd forward and soon the anchor chain is clustered with skeletons elizabeth has the small boat out and rows away from the dauntless looking ahead over her shoulder
cottons parrot is nowhere to be seen
in the distance pintel breaks the surface near the dauntless intent on climbing the anchor he looks over just as elizabeth rounds the point and rocks obscure the small longboat
more skeleton pirates appear and pintel continues his climb
two sailors alert and vigilant stare out toward shore
the island reveals nothing but blackness
there is a scurrying sound bones scraping against wood and the sailors jump
they listen intently nothing
nods hate those things
they turn back toward the island continue their vigil
a long pause
taste all right though
that they do
from behind the two sailors at the rail are well lit by a lantern
suddenly shadows appear skeletons climbing up the sailors backs
move closer and then the skeletons appear reaching the two sailors are grabbed from behind two bodies are tossed out over the rail hit the water with a splash
pintel looks down into the water satisfied
puts away his knife
notices pulls out a long piece of seaweed from his rib cage
turns to the others
be quick now
train the starboard guns on the beach and set your aim
wait for my signal we dont want to spook them
the pirates hurry to comply elizabeth rounds the point further and sees the black pearl anchored in the neighboring cove
a fleck of color cottons parrot as it darts in through a porthole
elizabeth slows her efforts silently approaching the ship
four pirates who really ought to be keeping watch instead have gathered wine bottles and rum casts into a pile along apples biscuits all the food on the ship
they act out a mock feast in anticipation of the curse being lifted
a skinny skeleton offers two bottles big skeleton
which would you prefer first good sir rum or wine
i believe ill have a spot o rum if you dont mind and thankee kind sir
they burst out laughing a hideous sound that wheezes through their bones
behind them unnoticed elizabeth peeks cautiously around a corner
she picks her moment and sneaks past quickly down a gangway disappearing into the blackness of the ship
gillette crouches running low behind a line of rocks
he reports to norrington all the men in place sir
ready to fire
wait for my order what the blazes is that
its the sound of cannon fire coming from the dauntless
cannonballs hit the shore men cry out in anguish
the sailors scramble to find refuge will guarded by pirates glares at jack
youve been planning this from the beginning
since you learned my name
jack takes the opportunity to move toward him
oh please do i really seem that clever
before will can answer jack smoothly slips the sword from a pirates scabbard tosses it to will who catches it despite his surprise
use it well
he draws his own sword and clobbers the pirate
barbossa and the other pirates stare in shock confound it jack i was actually beginning to like you
swords are drawn and the pirates attack
jack and will take on multiple opponents each with his own style will parries glissades and disarms with lightning fast and perfect form while jack uses his blade fists acrobatics
and anything within reach to survive
the sailors charge
the moon emerges from behind a cloud suddenly army of skeleton pirates rise up from the sea and charge the stunned sailors several men are struck down steady men
remember were the navy
the sailors recover their nerve and engage the enemy
its a full on battle royal navy against skeleton pirates the navy men are driven back surrounded suddenly there is a massive boom of cannon fire
norrington in the midst of a swordfight tries to see what is happening out there
its the black pearl manned by gibbs anamaria and cotton and captained by elizabeth coming around the point cannons blazing
the pirates on the ship are caught by surprise try to turn their cannons to this new foe gillette sees the black pearl firing on the dauntless
theyre on our side
take heart men
the royal navy stand their ground and fight only two pirates left barbossa and jacoby
jacoby rounds on will barbossa faces off against jack
just so you know jack i dont think youre that clever
i think youre a fool
a mortal fool
remarkable how often those two traits coincide
jack drives him back making barbossa laugh
you cant beat me jack
to prove his point he drops his own sword and catches jacks sword with both hands
jack cant free it
barbossa twists the sword from jacks grip reverses it will battling jacoby sees it he smashes jacoby in the jaw crumpling him jack
jack stares down at the sword jutting from his chest
he takes a few steps backward toward the aztec gold when he steps into the moonlight jack become skeletal
well isnt that interesting
skeleton jack pulls the sword from his chest
he pulls something from his pocket one of the aztec coins
theyre so pretty i just couldnt resist stealing one
its a curse i guess
barbossa grabs up his sword and rushes jack
both men are in moonlight now two skeletons in pitched battle
so what now jack sparrow
are we to be two immortals locked in epic battle until the trumpets of judgment day
or you could surrender
he shoves barbossa back out of the moonlight
barbossa stalks the room his attention focused on jack
or i could chain you to a cannonball and drop you in the deepest part of the ocean where you can contemplate your folly forever
barbossa charges jack stands out of the moonlight flesh and blood again holding his smoking pistol still aimed at barbossa
ten years you carried that pistol and you end up wasting your shot
he didnt waste it
will stands over the aztec chest holding a bloody sword his left hand in a fist
he opens the fist the medallion blood covering it drops from his hand revealing the cut in his palm
barbossa stares then looks down at his chest
blood blossoms on his shirt around the bullet hole
it spreads quickly
barbossa clutches his chest his face registering pain for the first time in years
barbossa falls heavily to the ground dead
jack blows the smoke from the barrel of his pistol
tosses it away
murtogg fires a pistol at a pirate
the pirate is hit screams in pain and crumples to the ground
mullroy runs through another with his sword
the pirates react to the sight and quickly realize their peril
they set their weapons down in surrender
the black pearl comes alongside the dauntless and jacks crew swarm across overwhelming the pirates
the sailors on the beach see it and cheer
will wraps a cloth around his palm jack joins him near the chest
well youre the worst pirate ive ever heard of
smiles youre a man who can be trusted who can be counted on and who can it betray his friends
what kind of pirate is that
admits it the worst
beat on the other hand maybe im a man who cant pass up a chance for revenge against the black hearted bastard who stole my ship and left me to
die in the middle of the ocean twice
and who knows how to get what he wants
now thats a great pirate
jack cuts his palm grips the coin he stole above the chest and then hesitates
will looks at him
jack releases the coin
it lands in the chest beside the other bloody coin
suddenly the lid of the chest all on its own slams shut
elizabeth stares at it
lets get out of here
jack will and norrington gather together on the beach
elizabeth calls out youre all right
the three men turn as one
an awkward moment which of them does she mean
elizabeth races across the sand toward them and straight to will
she throws her arms around his neck in a hug
miss swann are you wearing trousers
and how did you get off the island
elizabeth cant believe thats what he noticed
indignant she steps away from him
yes i am wearing trousers
and as for how we got off the island ah thats a grand adventure but now is not the time to talk about it
she reaches a hand behind his neck decisively kisses him
and dont you dare tell me that wasnt a proper kiss
elizabeth i think it doesnt matter that we are of a different class it doesnt
but that was not a proper kiss
pure consternation on elizabeths face this is a proper kiss
will sweeps her in his arms leans her back and kisses her long and well jack puts a hand on norringtons shoulder
i was rooting for you
close on wills face stoic staring forward
he stands straight and unmoving
around him are members of the royal navy standing before for a group of witnesses from town
it is the courtyard on the top of fort charles
a trial is underway with will as the defendant
and though i do say so with regret the law is clear
the penalty for piracy is death by hanging
in the crowd elizabeth squeezes the hand of her father swann
she lets go as swann stands
by your leave i wish to speak on behalf of the boy
a glance at elizabeth it is clear that these deeds were performed out of a sincere desire to do good at great personal risk
it seems to me that in the rare occasion where the right course is committing an act of piracy then an act of piracy is the right course
cheers of approval so in my capacity as governor i intend to grant a pardon to sir
all eyes turn
gillette stands at the top of a stairway
jack and his crew have escaped
gasps from the crowd there was no damage to the cell
they must have been set free
will and elizabeth exchange looks
not me you
no not me either
swann notices something the parapet points the black pearl
people rush to the parapet
sure enough below in the bay are the distinctive black sails of the pearl
the ship cuts through the waters very close to the point where the gallows of the pirates are
suddenly jack appears on the point he swings off the one empty gallows across and down onto the ships rigging as it passes
shall i break out the cannons
i dont think that will be necessary
norrington raises his hand
twirls a key on his finger
a days head start
thats all he gets
will elizabeth and swann look out toward ocean jack monkeys down the rigging
anamaria is at the wheel
captain sparrow the black pearl is yours
jack runs a hand lovingly along the rail then takes the wheel
it feels good right in his hands
he enjoys it and then shifts to captain mode
anamaria trim the mainsail
aye aye sir
gibbs organize a cleaning detail you and cotton
i want every inch of the pearl spic and span and ship shape
gibbs actually stomps the deck executes a salute
jack stands at the wheel hes got his ship back and all is right with the world
he begins to unconsciously hum yo ho yo ho a pirates life for me
he realizes what hes doing and smiles the orchestra takes over as the black pearl sails for uncharted waters
