written by lisa cholodenko stuart blumberg august the humming stillness of an american suburb on a summers day nannies push strollers joggers jog mailmen deliver dogs are walked kids shoot
hoop in wide open driveways
on a quiet tree lined street we pick up two young athletic looking boys riding bikes
laser allgood and his friend clay
like bats out of hell they pass block after block of charming evenly spaced houses until they round a corner and drop their bikes in front of a large ranch
they walk inside
we hear a baseball game on tv in another room
clay pounds on blue pills with a hammer reducing them to powder
i dont know dude
clay cuts the powder into lines with a school id card
b minus in geometry yo
this shits the bomb
clay rolls up a dollar bill and takes a snort
then hands the rolled up bill to laser
add it up son
laser takes the bill bends over and snorts a line
part oxford reading room part teenage girls lair
leaning against the bed we see joni allgood
its her room
she pours over a game of scrabble
sitting next to joni is her best girl friend sasha
sashas checking out jonis facebook page
jonis best guy friend jai sits across from her calculating his next scrabble move
oh my god joni there are so many hotties in your class
you are so gonna hook up the first week
just cause youre a hour drive thru doesnt mean everyone else has to be
hey she worked her ass off
she deserves some hot jock sausage
jai looks repulsed and hurt
why dont you guys just do it and get it over with
joni and jai blush
theyre both too scared to admit their crush on each other
im just asking
uh maybe because were friends
sasha turns to joni like an agent provocateur
laser and clay wrestle on the floor while clays dad watches a baseball game on tv
they bump into the couch
clays dad looks back menacing
take it down a notch
the boys keep wrestling wired from the pills
again they knock into the couch
clays dad spins around pissed
what did i just say
the dad grabs clay pulls him off of laser and over the couch
he gets his son in a headlock forcing the boys face into his big fat sweaty armpit
both dad and clay enjoy the brutal play
clay laughs manically
let me go
dont do the crime if you cant do the time
dad your pits smell like burnt ass
get off me
as laser observes this male bonding between father and son we note a trace of longing on his face
joni laser and jules allgood s fair skinned attractive sit before well prepared dinner
still buzzing laser taps his fingers incessantly on the table
knock it off
im not doing anything
nic allgood late s pulls up into the driveway beside a beat up white truck covered in aa slogan bumper stickers
drops her bag and heads for the table
sorry im late
we just started
all in the lining
she kisses jules
honey thats disgusting
did you do that laparoscopically
thats right smart girl
and we got em all
as nic settles in
hey whose truck is that
for the business
getting edgy the gardening
protective isnt it landscaping
yes thank you very much
then do we have any cabarnet left
i didnt look honey
nic gets up and goes to the kitchen for wine
lasers cell phone rings
he answers it
hey whats up
jules puts her hand on lasers arm
laser no phone calls at the table
into phone lemme hit you back
laser hangs up
nic re enters with a large glass of red
sitting down who was that
jules and nic share a look
jules starts making maternal windshield wiper strokes with her thumb on lasers arm
can i ask you something
what do you get from your relationship with clay
what do you mean get
laser looks down at jules thumb on his arm
do you feel like hes the kind of person who will help you grow
mom youre windshield wiping me
hey did you start on those thank you notes for your birthday gifts
but i will
i just think its easier to knock them out when its fresh
yeah i know ill do them tonight
i mean you dont want to have to start with an apology
then its embarrassing
she got it
let it go
okay ill let it go
then i mean if it was up to you our kids wouldnt even write thank you notes theyd just send out good vibes
nic takes another swig of vino and smiles at joni through increasingly plum stained teeth
i cant believe my babys
devolving into baby talk big girl
youre a big girl
joni mimes wiping her teeth
embarrassed nic starts licking at her stained teeth
as joni cranks out thank you notes laser enters
laser looks nervous
have you thought any more about you know making that call
i dont want to
i was just wondering if you changed your mind
he starts to leave but her answer bugs him
he turns back
how can you not even be curious
i just dont want to okay
im leaving soon and i dont want to deal with that right now
co dependent leak and also that could really hurt moms feelings
god why do you worry about them so much
they dont even have to know about it
look you can do it when you turn okay
i never ask you for anything
laser walks out of the room
joni feels horrible
nic and jules lay in bed watching tv unwinding from the day
i just dont understand why you bought the truck now
because if im starting this business i need something to haul my equipment in
it just seems a little cart before the horse
what does that mean
sweetie you dont even have any clients yet
well youre the one whos always telling me to act as if
back peddling thats true
the women settle back
nic sees jules feels bad
look im sorry
its good you bought the truck
nic caresses jules arm wanting to make it better
jules doesnt look at nic
she keeps her eyes on the t
wanna watch a movie
jules perks up
nic immediately regrets her suggestion
a movie movie
we havent done that in a while
are cozied up side by side facing the tv
the volume is turned low on two naked men lying on a chaise longue
one guy fellating the other
joni tiptoes up a dark staircase and enters an office off the moms bedroom
she heads for the desk and stealthy opens a drawer
she rummages though with clear intention
she pulls out a folder and studies the cover
we see the words pacific cryo clinic bringing your dreams to life
we now only see nic
jules has slipped under the blanket and is now between nics legs
we see nic trying to get into it but having a hard time
i dont like the guys in this one
theyre too shaved
dont focus on it
how about the one with the biker gang
we left it in hawaii
jules wrestles with the blankets
wants them out of her way
pulling them back up im cold honey
i couldnt breathe
jules wrangles the blankets trying to cover her partner
the transition is awkward and jules gets caught in the top sheet
as nic repositions herself she leans on the volume control button and suddenly the porn is blasting at full volume
suck that fat cock mother fucker
wheres the remote
im gonna fuck that tight ass
jules and nic both dive for the remote
its lost under the mass of bedding
they struggle to find it as the grunting and s disco music blares
joni turns to the wall confused
she hears the porno music pulsing though
nic finally recovers the remote and hits mute
nic flops back traumatized
the whole neighborhood heard that
no they didnt
well that was a vibe kill
jules looks defeated
joni turns back to the file on the desk
she flips though some pages of documents and stops
close on a photo of a year old boy standing in a sandbox looking straight into a camera with a big open grin
we see that boy years later carrying a box of tomatoes and putting them in the back of a truck
this is paul joni and lasers biological father
paul walks in carrying the box of tomatoes
he approaches tanya s the restaurants super sexy hostess
how you doing foxy
mm flapjack youre smelling ripe
no i like it
what can i say
ive just been out there you know
looking at the seating chart hows it looking tonight
they stand close to each other peering at the chart
gonna be tight
pauls cell rings
he gives tanya a hand squeeze and heads for the kitchen answering
hi is this paul hatfield
my name is wendy minter
im calling from the pacific cryobank
what can i do for you
i just need to confirm that you donated sperm with us between and
at the mention of the word sperm paul goes pale
i did a little bit of that back then
the kitchen is humming with cooks prepping for the dinner rush
he looks around for a quiet spot
as you know the cryobank has a confidentiality policy which prohibits us from releasing your identity without your consent
a cook margo approaches paul to speak with him
paul nods cant talk
hands her the box of tomatoes
paul heads to the back of the kitchen searching for privacy
paul moves into the pantry finds the farthest corner
well weve been contacted by a young woman conceived using your semen and shes asked if youd be open to having contact with her
paul and tanya enjoy a hot sweaty fuck
paul gets dressed while tanya lays on her messy bed
you must of figured youd get a call at some point
i mean i was when i did it
it was so long ago
i just figured no one actually used my stuff
tanya moves closer to him flirty
id use it
ignoring the innuendo this is so weird
i mean a part of mes really curious
so what are you gonna do
i dont know
joni and jules play scrabble at the table
jonis cell rings
she grabs it off the counter and answers
paul anxiously paces his overgrown back yard on his cell phone
he picks weeds as he talks
hi im looking for joni allgood
this is she
this is paul
clearing his throat uh your donor
joni shoots up out of her chair and starts leaving the room to get some privacy away from her mom
is this a good time to talk
where are you going
its your turn
joni doesnt answer
she just walks out to her backyard
doesnt know what to say how are you
how are you
im well thanks
banal awkward pause
paul jumps in to fill the void
so wendy at the cryobank said you call joni cuts in nervous and businesslike
actually my brother asked if id call you because im and hes only which is too young to call anyway hed like to meet you
if you want to
thrown your brother
well technically my half brother
each of my moms had a kid you know with your sperm
i didnt know
both of them
like in two
like in gay
i love lesbians
paul cringes at his lameness
joni doesnt know what to say
joni and laser get out of the car and head to the restaurant to meet paul
theyre both clearly nervous
i just dont want you to have big expectations
will you quit saying that
i dont have any expectations
im just saying he might be weird
i mean he donated sperm
well if he hadnt done it you wouldnt be here
so respect yo
paul sits alone at a table facing the entrance
he nervously checks the door as customers enter
joni and laser enter the restaurant
they look nervous too
he studies them for a beat sees them looking around
figures they must be his kids
they look in his direction spot him
he raises his hand stands
they walk over
the moment is rife
paul holds out his hand to joni
nice to meet you
nice to meet you too
paul holds out a hand to laser
and laser right
very cool name
thanks for making the trek all the way over here
no one knows what comes next
cool i got a table set up for us out here
paul turns and leads them out to the outdoor dining area
they all sit eating
paul cant help but study their faces
listen feel free and ask me anything you want okay
off their stares or we can just hang out
thats fine too
whatever you guys want
paul presses on trying to break the ice
anything you want to ask me laser
i didnt really have any specific questions
helping him out thats fine
id love to know about you guys
what about you joni
what are you up to
uh well i just graduated high school
im starting college in the fall
jonis the brains in the family
she won a national merit scholarship
shut the front door
and she got like an on her verbal sat
im just saying youre really smart
no i just work harder than you
dont stress it laze
school wasnt my thing either and i turned out okay
re his name laser
beat so tell me about you laser
what are you into
so his sister jumps in
lasers an amazing athlete
did you play any sports in school
i played a little basketball in junior high
the whole team thing got on my nerves you know like hey lets go kick some ass man
what about you
i play some soccer
you know team sports
paul realizes hes put his foot in his mouth
hey i wasnt bagging teams in general
teams are great
im just weird like that
yeah i like teams
we can tell laser is growing frustrated at his inability to connect with paul
joni jumps in
so this is your place
yeah ive been working on it for a while
i also have this organic co op farm down the road
we use a lot of the stuff we grow there for the restaurant
excited thats so cool
im totally into local
busting her you are
uh yeah laser
ive been like trying to get moms to buy local for forever
laser tries again to reconnect
so like do you raise pigs and stuff
beat but its a great spot
you guys should come check it out sometime
excited joni turns to laser
he seems uninterested
the kids and paul exit the restaurant
paul walks to a classic bmw motorcycle
lasers tries to hide his awe
is that yours
you like motorcycles
our moms are kind of anti motorcycle
and by kind of he means theyd kill us if we ever rode one
thats too bad
time to say goodbye
again no one knows the protocol here
after an awkward beat paul holds out his arms for hugs
well it was great to meet you guys
he and joni hug
i hope this was okay
now paul and laser share a somewhat awkward man hug
really nice to meet you laser
joni gives a quick wave to paul
she turns to go and laser follows
paul watches them walk away
he looks stirred up by the meeting
joni and laser head back home
i just never pictured him that way
i dont know
he was so cool and interesting
i cant believe that was him
he was so nice you know
youre the one that wanted to meet him so bad
well what did you think of him
i dont know
he seemed kind of into himself
nic and jules are cuddled up affectionately on the couch watching cable
they see laser on his way out of the house
hey bug come here
were watching locked up abroad uganda
i saw it
it was gnarly
where are you going
jules and nic shoot each other a concerned look
dont be back late okay
can i have a hug before you go
just a quick one
thats what shes there for
nic hits mute on the tv looks at jules
maybe we should just sit him down and ask him already
are you and clay fucking
exploring is the word id use
and what if he is exploring
this is the age for that
why should we care
then i just dont understand why hes exploring with that loser
look we dont even know what the deal is
were jumping to conclusions
i feel like he has so much potential and hes just wasting it
nics comment hits a nerve in jules
what are you trying to say
what do you mean what am i trying to say
it feels like theres some subtext here
what are you talking about
i dont know like mother like son
is that it
both of us aimless wandering in the darkness wasting our potential
nic wont go there
okay honey youre on a whole other tangent and i have no idea what youre talking about
well maybe it hasnt risen to the plane of consciousness for you yet
nic clicks the volume back on freezing jules out
paul and tanya sit at the bar eating family meal
so what were they like
they were really good kids
the boys kind of a sensitive jock and the girls kind of innocent but whip smart and super cute
sounds like you connected
yeah we kinda did
whered you leave it
we didnt really leave it anywhere
brooke the sexy wiccan volunteer comes up to paul bearing a basket of freshly picked fruits
paul leans over the basket
first strawberries of the season
dont they look awesome
i thought you should have the first taste
and with that she smiles hands him the basket and leaves
mimicking brooke i thought you should have the first taste
of my pussy
paul cant help smiling at the nasty talk
clay rummages through the top drawer of jules dresser
laser stands behind him uncomfortable
dude i dont think they smoke pot
close on a row of sex toys including a fancy pink japanese all in one dildo and a few dvds
clay turns on the dildo
it starts to gyrate
yo its alive
dude put it back
laughing clay throws the dildo back in the drawer
then he grabs one of the dvds and spins back around
dude were watching this
laser and clay sit on the bed
they look at each other
then laser hits play
we see a cop giving a young man a blow job
laser and clay sit motionless shocked disgusted riveted
think the whole things like this
want me to fast forward
clay doesnt answer
they just keep watching
jules pulls her truck into the driveway almost running over lasers bike
laser and clay are still watching the porn
as jules walks in the room
laser you left your bike out
laser reflexively grabs for the remote
as he fumbles for it jules sees what theyre watching
she looks mortified
we enter a family conference already in progress
nic and jules act calm but are inwardly mortified that their year old son found their porn
laser your mom and i accept you and love you unconditionally
you know that right
and you know you can be open with us about anything
yeah i know
jules steels herself for a frank discussion
laser is there anything you want to talk about
anything on your mind
laser cracks his knuckles
well there is something
nic and jules share a look
here we go
its more of a question really
we wont judge you
laser looks at his moms
nic and jules brace themselves
why do you guys watch gay man porn
nic and jules look at each other thrown
well first i have to say we rarely watch that movie jules touches nics arm
and secondly i really dont appreciate you snooping around our room
was that clays idea
i have to say again i dont like him
he seems untended
honey thats not what he asked snapping fine
do you want to answer his question
well sweetie human sexuality is complicated
and sometimes peoples desires can be
soldiering on for instance since womens sexual responsiveness is mostly internal sometimes its exciting for us to see sexual responsiveness more you know
laser looks at them still baffled
like with a penis
but like wouldnt you rather watch two women doing it
you would think that
but in most of those movies theyve hired two straight women to pretend and the inauthenticity is just unbeara okay thats enough
laser your mom and i have a sense theres some other stuff going on in your life and we just want to be let in
what do you mean
are you having a relationship with someone
you could tell us honey
wed understand and support you
laser looks confused
how did they find out about paul
i just met him once
nic and jules share a worried look
what do you mean once
did he find you on line
who did you meet once
i met him with joni
why was joni there
she set it up
forget the set up
who is paul
our sperm donor
jules and nic go white
wait did you guys think i was gay
joni has been pulled into the family conference
nic and jules are trying to remain as calm as possible
nic slugs a gulp of wine
look guys we understand why youd be curious about your biological father
thats totally natural
but why didnt you tell us
because we knew youd be upset
jules calms her riled up partner
to joni expressing her upset more calmly we just wish youd have included us in your thinking
but whats done is done
you met him and now you guys can move on sheepish actually
beat i want to see him again
to laser yeah
i was gonna tell you
regaining dominance nobody is seeing anyone until we meet him
joni looks at laser
they knew this would happen
nic and jules do a post mortem as they floss
yeah i get it
hes their biological father and all that crap but it still feels really shitty
like were not enough or something you know
of course i know
i dont want to time share our kids with someone
especially when its jonis last summer home
when jules leaves the room nic pulls a clump of long wet red hair out of the sink
the plumber was just here
nic throws the clump of hair in the trash
getting tactical look we need to be smart about this
if we act like grubby bitches were just gonna make it worse
lets just kill him with kindness and put it to bed
im with you honey
then were gonna get through this okay
she loves when jules shows confidence
i love you chicken
the women bump fists
they have a plan
i love you too pony
paul rides slowly down the street checking addresses
he pulls over and cuts his engine in front of the allgood house
paul rings the bell
the door opens and nic and jules are there smiling with kill him with kindness faces
it is so great to meet you
this is jules
paul shakes their hands
hi great to meet you two
i hope the traffic wasnt too bad
no ive got my bike so
i just sort of weave through
nic clocks the motorcycle stifles the impulse to judge
well come on in
as they enter paul holds out a bottle of wine
this is for you
i dont know if you guys like wine
nic takes it
are you kidding
we love it
checking the label and a petit syrah
what a treat
let me get some glasses
nic leaves paul by the stairs with jules
jules steals a look at him unable to contain her curiosity
how long you guys lived here
almost ten years
wait has it been that long
rambling nervously we moved right after laser broke his leg i remember that because we had a ramp for a while so that would have been
ten no nine
no ten years this fall
paul nods smiling at her nervousness
laser and joni enter
joni lights up when she sees paul
jules watches paul hug her
uncomfortable she heads for jules finds nics pouring herself a sizable glass of wine
not okay yeah
jules feels her inner co dependent swelling in her chest
go easy on the wine hon
its day time
and same goes for the micro managing
everyone sits at the picnic table
i hope the foods okay
joni told us you own a restaurant
the foods great
cant go wrong with salmon and corn
nic finishes a glass of wine as jules takes note
so paul did you always know you wanted to be in food services industry
paul smiles at nic trying to disarm her
well i always liked food
no i was asking because i remember reading in your file back when we were looking for you know sperm anyway you said you were studying international relations
wow that was a long time ago
yeah i was considering it but then i dropped out of school
you dropped out of college
yeah it wasnt my thing
it just seemed like a massive waste of money after a while
i mean i wasnt doing anything
i was just sitting on my ass listening to people spout off ideas i couldve just as easily learned reading a book
paul sees that his little rant may be alienating the moms
im not saying higher learning uniformly sucks
i mean college is great for some people
joni im sure youre gonna love it
thats just me
im just weird that way
beat which is probably why i ended up in the food services industry
see what he did there mom
you said food services industry then he said food services industry
yeah i got it laser
apropos of nothing so paul what about your social life
my social life
you know are you married divorced seeing anyone
were getting to know paul
no never been married or divorced
i date a little but im just kind of focused on my work right now
paul wants a break from the heat
so howd you guys meet
jules smiles embarrassed
nic jumps in
we met at ucla
i was a resident in the er and jules had an emergency
my tongue went numb
we turn to see laser pounding his head on the table
laser thats not nice
whats not nice is subjecting your kids to the same story times
ignoring laser what happened to your tongue
i dont know
i just lost all the feeling in my face and tongue and i thought i might gag and then you know
well it was pretty clear to me she was just having an anxiety attack and shed be fine
so whatd you do for her
gave her a vallium
tried to get her to relax talk move her tongue around
mom thats gross
ignoring laser to nic actually she started teasing me and that really helped
i was trying to distract you
and it worked
you were really funny
you were really pretty
nic reaches over and caresses jules hand
joni rolls her eyes embarrassed
so thats it
my tongue started working again
and weve been glued at the hip ever since
thats a great story
beaming we like it
laser and joni share a look
so nic i know youre a doctor
how bout you jules
what do you do
jules never likes this question
well i you know i studied architecture in college
but im not an architect
i mean i was on my way to becoming one
but i quit before the kids were born
well that happens
when they got a little older i started a balinese furniture import business
but that didnt work out
well business arent easy actually im in the process of starting a new business
good for you
before he can respond but not like a gardener
i mean yes theres a gardening component to it but the real work is to create unique eco friendly outdoor spaces that harmonize with the surrounding environment
do you know what i mean
in nics mind jules is drowning in verbiage
so she jumps in to save her
hey paul did joni tell you about her graduation speech
no she didnt
it was incredible
so full of wisdom and hope
turning to her joni hon go get it
im sure hed love to hear it
blushing no mom im sure he wouldnt
sure he would
go get it
getting upset no its okay
sweetie dont be embarrassed
im not embarrassed
give it a rest already
this outburst stuns nic into silence
her daughter has never spoken to her like this
laser stands up
ill get the ice cream
standing up ill help you
joni and laser leave the room
nic pours herself the last of pauls petit syrah
jules smiles covering her anxiety
softly honey thats your forth glass
actually its my third
but thanks for counting
paul turns to jules trying to revive the mood
hey i was just thinking
you know i bought this place last year and the backyards a wreck
would you be interested in working on it
insecure oh thats okay
i dont have time to work on it myself
thats really sweet
why dont you think about it
i just did
then i mean if youre not up for it thats okay jumping on it no
getting excited im up for it
jules smiles at nic isnt this great
my first client
nic looks less than pleased
nic pushes a cart piled high with gardening supplies
jules grabs a couple bags of fertilizer throws them on top
im just saying the plan was to limit his involvement youre unbelievable
youre all over me about getting clients i finally get one and youre hes not just a client jules
hes our sperm donor
have you ever heard the phrase dont shit where you eat
yes and i think its disgusting
the two separate go down separate isles
when they rejoin nic is contrite
he just seemed sort of
self satisfied to me
jules grabs the olive branch
yeah he was working the whole alternative thing pretty hard
mimicking i just need to get outside and do things not sit on my ass and learn
but thats just me
im weird that way
they both laugh
nics funny sometimes
jules drives slowly up the hill looking for pauls address
she sees the house and pulls in the driveway next to an old truck and a motorcycle
jules and paul walk through pauls backyard evaluating
we could do a kind of a secret garden thing with trellises and topiary
clocking his face or something more asian minimal with a rock garden feel
its up to you
what do you think
personally im tired of minimal
im into more is more
lets not try to tame the space
i think it would look great all lush and overgrown and fecund
im sorry you know fertile
no i love that word
you just dont hear it that often
thinking more is more
lets do that
jules is staring at paul
sorry i just keep seeing my kids in your expressions
jules looks more intensely at pauls face
you and laser have the same mouth
you think so
the observation strikes paul
suddenly hes feeling a kind of fast tracked intimacy with jules he hadnt expected
jules and laser play ping pong as nic gets home with chinese take out for the family dinner
whats the score
laser cranks a forehand that whizzes past jules
so howd it go today
we settled on a concept
what is it
its hard to explain
you have to kind of see the space to get it
to laser laser did you write pup pup a get well card
off his silence laser
what do i have to do
i bought you a card
i left it on your desk
all you had to do was mom settle
dont tell me to settle mister
and if its not in the mail by tomorrow morning were not going to the dodger game saturday
whatever i have other plans anyway
what other plans
off his silence im asking you a quest i said id do something with paul
laser serves a rocket whizzing past a flailing jules
he tosses the racquet on the table and leaves
nic yells you used to be so cute
we cut onto paul and laser looking out at something
laser is holding a digital video camera
this may not be a good idea
are you filming
we cut to clay on a skateboard on the ledge of a brick wall
hes preparing to ride the ledge jump a dumpster and land his board on the ground
to laser hes not gonna make it
calling to clay clay youre not gonna make it
i think he may be right dude
maybe this isnt such a good idea
will you quit being a man gina and run the camera
im only doing this once so keep my shit in frame
laser sighs then holds up the camera
paul looks at laser wondering why he puts up with this guy
video cameras pov we watch as clay psychs himself up with an assortment of deep breaths and head slaps
finally he starts down the ledge
he starts his jump catches air and hits the edge of the dumpster and falls
we see him go into the dumpster and land with a nauseating thud
paul and laser rush up and look over the edge
theres clay his arm bent at a disturbing angle in agony
did you get that
seriously dude are you okay
im fucking fine
did you fucking get it
paul and laser walk over to pauls truck
maybe next time we can hang out just you and me
hes just gets a little amped sometimes
thats not amped
thats being a dick
hes not a dick thats just his way
i just didnt like the way he was talking to you
defensive well you dont know him
back peddling youre right
hey can i ask you a question
whyd you donate sperm
well its a lot more fun then donating blood
laser doesnt laugh
paul realizes hes gonna have to give a non joke answer
i dont know i guess i thought you know if i can help somebody in need somebody who wants a baby
lasers not really buying that
so you did it to help people
it was a long time ago
how much did you get paid
why do you want to know
im just curious
i dont know like bucks a pop
it was worth more back then
off lasers look hey im glad i did it
laser doesnt quite buy pauls altruism
he looks over at him then away
jai and joni and sasha play scrabble
sasha checks out the photos of paul on jonis phone
stone cold fox
must you take everything beautiful and make it dirty
im just saying
spermsters a hottie
is he single
okay first of all ewww
second hes a really good person and id prefer it if you didnt taint him with your whore juice
sasha hops up energized by the banter
fair enough hairy muff
im outta here
you love birds can split my letters
sasha splits and suddenly the room is thick with nervous tension
you want to keep playing
as jai incorporates sashas tiles into his own we see joni gathering her nerve to make a move
jai probably feels it but in his nervousness he cant look at joni
sometimes i feel sorry for sasha you know
joni starts to move in her face draws closer to jais inch by inch
somehow deep down jai can sense her moving towards him which exhilarates and freaks the shit out of him at the same time
to the point where he lets slip
its like she has to sexualize every experience you know
its just sad
that stops joni in her tracks
yeah it is
its really sad
jais sabotaged the mood and they both know it
jules walks in to find nic in sexy satin man pjs sitting at the rim of a running bath
there are candles burning
jules takes a seat beside her
nic holds her hand
im sorry ive been such a bitch lately
i know im not being my highest self
youve been really patient with me
i just want you to know that hasnt gone unrecognized
nic gives her a long sweet kiss
jules is warming up
in the tub revelling in the warm bubbly water
nic is sitting on the ledge massaging her feet
oh god chicken thats the spot
hows the water
you wanna come in
in a bit
you enjoy it first
nic goes deeper with the massage
jules eyes roll back
oh i forgot the lavender salts
nic starts to get up
jules grabs her hand
no dont stop
no i meant to put em in
nic gets up and sashays to the door
jules sinks back wishing nic had stayed
getting impatient and upset
nic is on her cell with a patient a glass of wine in her hand
jules walks in wearing a bathrobe
raises a finger and mouths sorry
no were planning on being here through mid august so
beat no i promise im not going anywhere
jules face drops she turns and leaves
paul watches jules work in his backyard
luis hauls shrubs
paul and jules stand at the kitchen table looking over her sketch for the yard
look im gonna go to the nursery in the morning so we should probably make sure youre signed off on the bougainvillea
jules looks over at a pan on the kitchen counter
strawberry rhubarb pie
fresh from my garden
paul hands her a fork and she takes a big bite
her eyes roll back in her head
oh my god
that is criminal
no please just take it away
you had one bite
i have another you may as well just tape it to my ass cause thats where itll end up
hey now dont go negative on your ass
jules blushes at all this talk of her ass
youre good with the plants
off his silence look we dont have to do that
we could do go in a totally different direction if you no im just thinking
covers his eyes yeah im good with the plants
sometimes i mistake silence for criticism
i wasnt criticizing you
no i know
beat sometimes nic can be a little critical you know
shes a perfectionist
that doesnt mean you have to be negative
jules looks away
we hear a knock from the back
excuse me senora
jules turns sees luis standing at the glass door
jules wants luis to leave her alone
but hes not going
same time tomorrow
jules turns back to paul laughs nervously
im gonna take off too
in luiss accent same time tomorrow
jules pushes paul laughing
paul hands her a tupperware with some of the pie in it
here take this
just give it to the kids
god youre such a pusher
jules grabs the pie and gives him a kiss on the mouth almost as a mistake
before they know it theyre making out
jules snaps back freaked
i dont know where that came from
freaked himself its okay
im gonna go now
jules starts backing away acting as if nothing happened
overcompensating but i shall return
jules bolts for the door clutching her pie
paul watches her go stunned by what just happened
nics in bed reading a magazine
jules gets in bed paranoid
nic puts her magazine down
so howd it go with paul
jumpy what do you mean
i dont know
did you break ground
did you dig in
i dont know the terms
no we just talked
oh so it was less of a doing day huh
was he okay with that
you know maybe we should lay off the paul digs a little
chastened nic looks back at her magazine
jules rolls over
and i also think we should start composting
sweating and dirty joni and paul pull radishes from the ground
theyre in a zone together
paul takes off his sun hat and put it on jonis head
you got your moms fair skin
you didnt get my mediterranean genes
jonis cell rings
rolls her eyes
joni hits the ignore button puts her cell away
my mom nic
shes making me insane
whats she doing
shes treating me like im
its like she doesnt want to admit im an adult
shes your mom
thats her job
to smother me to death
thats not her job
well if you want things to be different youve got to make that happen
thats your job
laser walks with clay
clay sports a homemade arm cast for the skateboard mishap we witnessed earlier
that jump was cake dude
i so couldve made it
you were like feet short dude
there was no way
yeah well if paul wasnt there i could have landed it
that guy creeps me out
hes kind of a fag dude
tryin to act all like your dad and shit
laser doesnt know how to respond so he ignores the comment
a stray dog comes up to them
laser stops to pet it
laser sees the dog has no tags
he looks around for an owner
the dog nuzzles laser for affection
ive seen this dog around
i wonder if hes lost
lets pee on his head
clay unzips his fly
its difficult with the plaster cast
dude dont do that
clay yanks the dog by his scruff
dude quit it
mocking duuude quit it
suddenly laser gets it
his friend is the tool
he grabs the dog and smacks him to get him to run away
get out of here
the dog takes off
clay shoves laser
why are you such a fag
laser shoves clay back hard
why are you such a dick
clay hits laser in the mouth
laser touches his lip
sees blood and walks away
paul and joni walk to his motorcycle parked in the dirt lot behind them
paul grabs his helmet off the bike hands it to joni
here put this on
joni takes the helmet and puts it on
paul fastens the buckle for her
they get on the bike and take off down the hill
paul takes joni home on his motorcycle via sunset boulevard
she holds paul tightly
the ladies sit in the living room watching tv
shell get home when she gets home
quit telling me to relax
they go back to watching tv
after a beat we hear a motorcycle pull up
what the fuck
paul and joni climb off the bike
nic storms out of the house to intercept them by the sidewalk
funny how someone conveniently forgot to tell me they were driving home on a motorcycle
you know how many people ive seen come into the hospital paralyzed from motorcycle accidents
im a very safe rider
that is so not the point im making
joni knows this is something id never allow
mom im years old
i wont even be living here in like next month
yeah well youre living here now
yeah well why dont you get a jump on it and pretend like im not
joni storms off
nic glowers at paul
shes never talked to me like that
trying to soften it you know nic
if you eased up on the restrictions maybe thered be less tension
marinated in sarcasm really
you think so paul
is that how it works
jules walks up to intervene
whats going on
pauls just giving me child rearing lessons
i was just saying
listen when youve been a parent for years come talk to me
i was just making an observation
yeah and i need your observations like i need a dick in my ass
nic storms off
paul watches shell shocked
nic knocks on the door
gets no response
silence i was just upset
you know how i feel about motorcycles
joni opens the door
patronizing i know how you feel about them
but im an adult now and you have to respect that
joni closes the door on her
from his house paul watches jules working on her knees in the garden
close on jules thong peaking out of her jeans
luis walks across pauls field of vision interrupting his reverie
jules steps tentatively into pauls house
jules walks further into the house
she looks anxious
paul opens his office door and sees jules in the hall
look im sorry about last night
im really embarrassed
shes the one who wigged out
i know shes just going through a lot of stuff right now
jules its okay
you dont have to defend her
they stare at each other unsure how to act
and look i just want you to know about the other day the kiss thats not something i
yeah i sensed that
she takes a step toward him feverish
i just wanted to clear the air
they stare at each other
its like watching two magnets
the air is clear
jules grabs paul and starts smothering him with kisses
it takes a second for paul to get his bearings but when he does he starts kissing her back with equal fervor pushing her up against the wall wedging his
hand between her legs
paul i cant
you dont want to
no i do
urgent whisper i have a guy outside
overcome with lust jules wraps her legs around his waist and paul walks her into
quick cuts of their awkward ravenous gropings
somewhere between slapstick and animal
he pulls her hair back hard
she loves it
she pulls his hair back harder
she pulls down his underwear
her eyes widen
its been decades since shes seen a hard cock in the flesh
cut to them fucking
its gawky and passionate
somewhere in the middle of it jules starts laughing
paul flips her on her hands and knees and they go at it some more
she keeps laughing
paul goes harder to make her stop
the paces grows quicker
theyre getting closer
excuse me senora allgood
they stop mid thrust
you gotta be fucking kidding me
she dislodges from paul and starts dressing furiously
jules runs out to meet luis waiting patiently at the door
where do you want the stones
catching her breath the stones
over by the fence
luis stares at his employer
she looks totally disheveled
jules starts feeling her hair smoothing it into shape
i was using the bathroom
then do you need to use the bathroom
luis stares at her feet
she looks down
paul and laser shoot hoop
theres a tense ness to their patter
laser takes the ball and steps to the top of the key and shoots
laser steps up to left side of the basket calls his shot
hey dont take it easy on me cause youre winning laser does a trick behind the back lay up
then tosses the ball to paul
nobody likes a show off
hey can i ask you a question
when you die do you want to be buried or cremated
thats your question
i want to be cremated
i think id rather be buried
thats just taking up more space in the earth
i dont know something about the idea of being burned into this chalky powder and sprinkled what do you care
you wont even be conscious
i guess i just want to be in a place where people can visit me
growing animated but why
youll be dead
you wont even know theyre there
joni and sasha are at a table eating dinner
tanya has temporarily joined them
sasha checks out tanyas oversized african bead necklace
joni watches paul charm customers
god i love your necklace
whered you get it
i dont know some flea market
no more like pasadena
well its really awesome
paul saunters up to the table and stands behind sasha
he mindlessly places his hand on sashas shoulder
sorry guys i need to steal tanya back now
sasha clocks pauls hand
she carefully and without looking back places her hand on top of his
thats okay paul
getting up well ladies it was fun talking with you
paul pulls his hand away from sashas and walks off with tanya
sasha turns to joni
okay im sorry but your donor daddy is giving me the sex vibe
no hes not
he wouldnt do that
hes not my dad
god sasha thats totally gross
not everybody wants to have sex with you okay
especially when you act like a slut
well it makes you seem insecure and desperate
im not insecure and desperate
im just a normal sexual person
and maybe youd get that if you werent so uptight
im not uptight
nic and jules dine with their friends joel and stella
nics drinking like a fish
oh my god these heirloom tomatoes are insane
joni brought some home from pauls garden the other day
they were huge
nic tightens at the mention of paul
so the kids have been spending time with him
oh yeah theyre spending all kinds of quality time together
senses the sarcasm well its great they like him so much
you know you hear these stories about kids meeting their donors and the guys end up being nothing like they were on paper
no everyones getting along famously
apparently paul can do no wrong
nic grabs a passing waiter by the arm
can we get another bottle of the seavey cabernet
jules gives nic a look
joel and stella feel the tension between them
hey have you guys tried those acai fruit packs
no but theyre pushing them like crack at whole foods
what i do is i throw one in the blender with some bananas frozen strawberries and hemp milk and ill tell you its sensational
nic slaps her forehead
oh just fucking kill me
jules is embarrassed
im sorry guys but i just cant with the fucking hemp milk and the organic farming and heirloom tomatoes
mocking voice oh no dont throw that in the trash no man you gotta throw that into the composting bin so the fucking worms can shit all over it and
turn it into glorious multch and we can all feel better about ourselves
what a bunch of bullshit
nic takes a big swallow from her glass
jules windshield wipes nics forearm
sotto how about some green tea honey
nic slams her glass on the table
you know what jules
i like my wine
so fucking sue me
and fyi red wine has a chemical called resveratrol in it which has been proven to significantly extend human lifespan
yeah if you drink a thousand bottles a day
nic storms off
jules turns to joel and stella ashen
jules walks over to the bar
nic is sitting in the corner
what the hell is going on with you
this whole paul thing is driving me crazy
i feel like hes taking over my family
jules tries to bring it down
she yells in hushed tones
nerves fraying okay
im just exhausted
maybe you need to take some time off and recharge
self pitying sure and whos gonna pay for that
jules looks pissed off and hurt
look im sorry i just feel like im carrying the whole load here
because thats the way you like it
thats the way you keep control
this is jules break point
what are you talking about
oh come on
you hated it when i worked
you wanted me at home taking care of the kids
you wanted a wife
that is just not true
you didnt trust any of those nannies
and you sure as hell didnt back my career
what are you talking about
i just helped you start another business
yeah so you can feel better about yourself
no so you can feel better about yourself
are you even attracted to me anymore
the bartender holds out the bottle of cabernet
do you still want this
just the check please
fucking again in his bedroom
jules writhes beneath him her eyes closed
paul seems to be in some kind of zone
he stares at her enthralled
jules and paul lie naked in the bed
jules slithers around the covers stoned on post coital endorphins
god i feel so drugular right now
sitting up quickly i really want a cigarette
do you have any
i havent had a cigarette since laser was born
do you smoke
but i dont have any here
want me to run to the store
bouncing off the walls yeah
jules pops up on her knees getting in his face
do you think im just like some sad sack middle aged lesbian
god thats it
i was trying to figure out how to describe you to my friends
jules punches his arm mock hurt
they start rough housing
then the phone rings
you want to get that
i want to get this
paul grabs a handful of jules ass
jules throws her leg over paul and climbs up for another round
suddenly jonis voice echoes through the machine
i just wanted to apologize for my friend sasha
i was really embarrassed when she put her hand on your paul grabs the receiver
jules visibly recoils
listen dont worry about your friend
she mouths what are you doing
paul gesticulates im sorry
i didnt even notice
jules throws on her clothes and starts to leave
can you hold on a second
paul grabs jules wrist and mouths wait
jules rips her arm free and walks out
walks outside and is stunned to find luis already back from home depot sneezing and wiping his nose
did you go to home depot
i just got back
that was fast
yeah no lines
his look of confusion trips off her paranoia
shes convinced he knows everything
whats that look
the look youre giving me right now
thats no look
that just my face
look im not gonna play this game with you
you need to keep your judgements to yourself
senora i didnt give no looks
i dont ask you why you keep blowing your nose constantly
i mean if you have a drug problem thats your business
i dont have no drug problem
i have the allergies
then why are you a gardener
luis stares at jules innocent
cause i love the flowers
look this isnt gonna work
ill pay you through the end of the day and then were done
jules walks past a totally confused luis
jules lies on her side
nic shuffles to get to close to her
jules moves away still pissed at her
nic realizes she needs to make amends
the family sits in silence having breakfast
nic looks around the table feeling like a pariah
look i know youve all been enjoying your time with paul
and i know i havent been as open to him as everyone else and this has caused some
but id like to try and change that
everyone keeps eating uncommitted
so i was thinking
maybe it would be nice if we all had dinner at his house sometime
that way i could get to know him a little better and i could see all the good work moms been doing with his backyard
nic looks at jules and smiles
they recognize this is a big step for nic
paul walks out to check on jules
shes sweating her ass off shlepping stacks of heavy mulch across the yard
hows it going
here let me help
paul takes some of her load and together they transport the sod to the other side of the yard
neither know what to say
paul stares at her waiting for her lead
we cant be doing this
and the kids
yeah and i love nic
they stare at each other and we cut to
paul and jules lie in bed
jules looks nauseated
paul offers her a pack of smokes
i got you some cigarettes
ignoring him jesus whats wrong with me
i shouldnt have fired luis like that
that was totally wrong
dont be so hard on yourself
things get messy sometimes
that wasnt messy
that was fucked up
im totally fucked up
i think im really falling for you
jules takes a shower washing off the evidence
she looks nauseated by her lack of willpower
tanya walks over to paul whos on his computer
she flops on the couch next to him
he doesnt look up
pretty good night
that table had like bottles of wine
shes got some of your genes
i think she looks more like her mom actually
but thank you
its cute seeing you in dad mode
lowering voice it makes me want to fuck you
uncomfortable oh yeah
tanya moves imperceptibly closer
ive been missing our sleep overs
paul finally stops what hes doing
yeah its been a while
you want to meet up later
he doesnt know how to say no
tanya youre so sexy and beautiful but i dont think we should do that anymore
tanyas face drops
you know our thing is really fun and easy but
i dont want to be and still hanging out
if i really want a family then i have to stop getting in these situations that dont go anywhere
paul just looks at her
tanya gets it
welling up oh
paul knows enough to say nothing
tanya gets up and walks off
paul sits there feeling like an asshole
the family packs into the volvo to head to pauls
paul gets dinner ready with joni and laser as his sous chefs
both kids seem really jazzed to be cooking with him
jules tours nic around the backyard looking a little freaked out as she shows her the work shes been doing
im gonna do some planting over there so it wont look so bare
it looks great honey
im so proud of you
nic kisses jules spontaneously
jules looks nauseous again
they head back up the stairs toward pauls house
hey so hows that guy luis working out
oh i had to fire him
yeah he had a drug problem
what kind of drugs
blow i think
nic flips through pauls album collection including joni mitchells blue
everyone digs into the meal enjoying themselves
especially nic whos committed to redeeming herself
hey nic i think youre gonna love this screaming eagle
you know what i think im gonna stick with water tonight
but thank you so much
the allgoods look at nic this is a first
god paul this steak is delicious
whats the seasoning
i just mist it with a little truffle oil
nic looks at jules and smiles in full overcompensation mode
what a good idea
we should try that
taken aback by nics cheerfulness mmm hmmm
and its done to perfection
so its not too rare
no its perfect
exactly what rares supposed to be
a lot of people in the restaurant order a steak rare and they freak out at the slightest sight of red
ugh isnt that annoying
that happens to me all the time when im grilling
dont people know that rare means red
it means bloody
they should see what rare looks like in argentina
the cows practically still mooing
laser chuckles at pauls joke then reigns it in
joni tries to insert herself in the conversation
i really want to go to argentina
buenos aires is supposed to be interrupting so paul i was checking out your album collection over there
quite the eclectic mix
you dont meet too many straight guys who love joni mitchell
joni glares at nic stop being such a paul hog
oh yeah you a joni mitchell fan
smug not really
we just named our daughter after her
whats your favorite joni album
i think i have to go with blue
nic raises her hand in a testify
they high five across the table
oh god i probably spent half of high school in my room crying to that album
that record kills me
i know it never lets up you got river california
a case of you
all i want
nic pulls her hands to her chest shuts her eyes
and starts to sing
i am on a lonely road and i am traveling traveling traveling traveling looking for something what can it be oh i hate you some i hate you some i
love you some oh i love you when i forget about me
jules paul and the kids watch open mouthed as nic soldiers on skipping ahead to another verse
i want to talk to you i want to shampoo you i want to renew you again and again applause applause life is our cause when i think of your
kisses my mind see saws
nic takes a breath
just as pauls about to say something nic resumes her unfortunate solo
do you see do you see do you see how you hu urt me baby so i hurt you too then we both get soo ooo ooo blue
nic stops eyes still closed
shes connected to a part of herself she rarely lets herself visit
the moment is punctured by her smart ass year old son
dont quit your day job mom
its hard enough to open your heart in this world
dont make it harder
to nic contrite im sorry mom
nic looks at paul
then looks at jules and points to paul
i like this guy
paul looks at joni
you didnt tell me you were named after joni m
its just so dorky
i dont really like to bring it up
i think its cool
getting up hey paul
wheres your bathroom
just around there
on her way to the loo nic turns back to paul
you know what
i think i will try some of that screaming eagle
nic washes her hands at the sink
something catches her eye
she lifts pauls hairbrush from the shelf in front of her and examines it
she reaches into the bristles and pulls out
a few strands of long red hair
nic on her knees in pauls shower pulling a clump of tell tale red hair from the drain
nic skulks out of the bathroom
she looks out and b lines for the bedroom
nic pulling pillows off pauls bed
her look tells us shes found hair here as well
nic sitting back down at the table
she looks drained
the sound drops out
paul and jules talking comfortably
joni and laser chiming in smiling one big happy family
she wants to scream but it feels like shes trapped in cement
things slow way down
nic and jules perform their nightly ablutions
jules is sonic caring her teeth
through the sonic buzz well you and paul seemed to get on like gang busters
youre sleeping with him arent you
nic turns to her eyes red with anger
just be honest with me
dont make me feel crazier than i feel right now
where is this coming from
i found your hair in his drain
i was working
i got dirty so i took a shower
you take a nap too
jules pauses a second too long
the jig is up
the truth has come out
nic is so angry shes calm
are you in love with him
what are you straight now
it has nothing to do with that
beat ive just felt so cut off from you lately
oh right so its my fault
who said anything about fault
just listen to me
i just needed
to be fucked
its always what im not doing for you isnt it
well heres what i dont to you
i dont work out my issues by fucking other people
nic starts heading for the door
hes not just other people
no you had to go fuck our sperm donor
you couldnt have picked a more painful way to hurt me
where are you going
i need water
my mouth is dry
nic opens the door
theres joni and laser looking devastated
theyve been listening to the whole thing
jules wakes up looking crusty from a rough night on the couch
she looks like she hasnt slept at all
jules enters and walks over to her sleeping son
she gently nudges him awake
laser turns over semi conscious
she sits down on his bed
listen i know you and joni heard whats going on
i just want you to know that what happened with paul and me is over
theres nothing going on now
i know you might need some time to process your feelings around this but i just want you to know that im here for you if you want to talk
beat is there anything you want to talk about
leave my room not really
fighting the impulse to push it okay then
go back to sleep
jules pats her son and leaves
jules enters and touches jonis shoulder
i dont want to talk to you
can we just i said i dont want to talk to you
jules slowly retreats to the door
jules drinks coffee at the table
nic walks in dressed for work
jules looks at her wanting to process
but nic isnt in the mood
she grabs a banana from a bowl and walks out
jules feels like a leper
we can tell jonis been crying and downloading the whole thing to sasha
hows nic doing
shes a wreck
ive never seen her like this before
jonis cell rings
she gets off the bed looks at the phone
its a picture of paul
is it him
joni nods gravely answers
pauls walking through rows of swiss chard cell phone to his ear
hey joni how you doing
youre such a phony
you act like youre so groovy and together but youre not
youre a shitty person
with my mom
listen can i just come and talk with you whats wrong with you
dont call me anymore
joni hangs up and start crying
sasha hugs her
sweaty nauseous with remorse paul turns around to find fetching young brooke waiting for him with a wicker basket of huge cucumbers
hey paul look at these cukes
paul holds up his hand at her
this girl symbolizes every bad choice hes ever made
he gives her the universal leave me alone gesture
brooke looks embarrassed
jules sits on a lawn chair smoking a cigarette
her cell rings
paul walks down the street wigging out
hey its me
i just talked to joni
oh my god im so sorry
i should have called you
jules sucks a big anxious drag off a cigarette
nic saw my hair in your bathroom
the other night
listen its all out in the open now
lets make this happen
no im serious
lets get the kids together and do this thing
paul come on
im sick of this life
i want a family
im ready eye rolling jesus paul
jules tosses the phone away from her
joni and sasha stand at the makeshift bar
jonis downs several tequila shots quickly
slow down tiger
across the room joni spots jai chatting with a waify girl in a sundress
joni drops one more tequila shot and walks up to jai and waify girl interrupting them
i like the scruff
waify girl juts out her hip territorially
uh scuuuse me
then back to jai hey can i talk to you
joni leads jai to a private corner
she leans in and kisses jai
and jai actually returns the kiss
and its completely sweet and intimate
but then the kiss starts to morph as jonis energy turns manic intense less romantic than emotionally needy
we see jai start to pull away
but joni keeps holding him wanting more
finally jai breaks off the kiss
joni looks pained embarrassed
jai keeps holding her hands
are you okay
yeah im fine
joni pulls free and escapes leaving a confused jai in her wake
jules walks in to find nic awake in bed
just getting another pillow
the couch is kind of saggy
is your back okay
jules perks up is this an invitation to share the bed again
its a little ache y
you should take some advil
suddenly they hear bumping and loud footsteps downstairs
jules walks downstairs to find joni stumbling toward her bedroom
how was the party
joni tries to avert her moms questioning gaze
how big was it
i dont know
jules takes in the glassy look in her daughters eyes
are you drunk
nic enters from the stairs having caught the last piece
i hope you had a designated driver
im not drunk
well you seem drunk to me
yeah well you should know
furious incredulous what did you just say to me
im going to bed
joni starts to leave
nic grabs her
no youre not
im not done talking to you
laser opens his door and watches the scene progress
what do you want from me
i did everything you wanted
i got all as
i got in everywhere i applied
now you can show everybody what a perfect family you have
dont talk to your mom like that
joni spins to face jules
youre really gonna tell me how to act
hey im still your mother
jules reaches out and joni backs away sickened
dont touch me
joni heads for her room
im so sick of both of you
the sun rises on this formerly happy home
jules wakes up on the couch
rubs her aching back
joni packs for college
the room is littered with half filled packing boxes
she picks up a pile of clothes from the corner and sees the farmers hat paul gave her
she puts it aside not sure what to do with it
paul looks around his newly landscaped yard
it looks more abandoned than revived
the family has their last supper before joni leaves
did you pack that lamp i gave you
well we can always get stuff up there too if you need it i mean if the rooms dark or you need extra bedding
im not going to siberia mom
jules looks at the family unit misty
i cant believe this is our last dinner together
oh god are you gonna cry
jules looks at her son fed up
i wish you were gay
youd be so much more sensitive
the doorbell rings
its probably sasha
ill get it
joni runs to the door
its not sasha
shocked what are you doing here
i needed to talk to you before you left
theres nothing to talk about
i just want to apologize again for what happened
i cant tell you how much i regret it
joni walks out for privacy closes the door behind her
so like everything that happened between us
what was that
was that just bullshit
no it wasnt bullshit at all
i know i dont seem credible right now but i really care about you
paul struggles to keep his emotions in check
and i just hope someday well be able to see each other again
do you think that could maybe happen
i dont know
joni looks down welling up
i just wish you couldve been
joni chokes back tears
paul and joni look up at each other when the door suddenly flings open
nic is there fuming
youve got some balls mister
nic hold on
nic walks toward he and joni
joni ducks back inside
no you hold on
let me tell you something you really hurt my kids
well theyre kinda my
cutting him off no
this is not your family
this is my family
youre just a fucking interloper
jules joins nic concerned things are getting out of hand
i didnt mean to hurt anyone
paul and jules share a look as nic deals the coup de grace
if you want a family so much go out and make one of your own
nic heads back inside and slams the door behind her
paul stand alone spinning
after a moment he spontaneously looks back into the house
laser is staring at him through the window
their eyes lock and paul give laser a contrite smile
thats the final straw for laser
he grabs his plate and walks out of view
reeling paul heads for his motorcycle
he gets on the bike helmet in hand
turns on the ignition
he picks up the helmet and pauses shaking in the hell of his own making
losing it he hurls the helmet at the motorcycle
laser joni and nic watch locked up abroad jules walks in front of them picks up the remote and turns off the tv
i need to say something
everyone sits up
jules acts stoic but shes wrecked
look its no big secret your mom and are in hell right now
marriage is hard
really fucking hard
just two people slogging through the shit year after year getting older changing
its a fucking marathon okay
everyone is silenced by the outpouring
jules soldiers on
so sometimes youre together so long you just stop seeing the other person
you just see weird projections of your own junk
and instead of talking to each other you go off the rails and act grubby and make stupid choices
which is what i did
and i feel sick about it because i love you guys and i love your mom and thats the truth
sometimes you hurt the ones you love the most
i dont know why
maybe if i read more russian novels i would
nic looks down overwhelmed by it all
anyway i just wanted to say how sorry i am about what i did and that i hope youll forgive me eventually
awkward thank you
and without further ado jules hands the remote back to laser and departs the field
everyones silenced by jules rambling apologia especially nic
joni wakes up
she looks around her room
theres nothing on the walls
the floor is covered with boxes taped and labeled
its time to go
nic and jules stuff the last of jonis things in the back of their station wagon
laser and joni bring the last of the boxes out of the house
the allgoods are on the road heading to college
the station wagon passes through the campus
as they drive past buildings and dorms joni sees students swarming the campus
she takes it all in nervous excited
nic and jules steal looks back at joni feeling her nervousness wishing they could take it away
the allgoods pull up to the curb get out
laser piles jonis boxes on his skateboard
laser dollies jonis boxes though the corridor and while joni and the moms follow behind
nic and jules follow joni to the door
they all jam up at the threshold
guys its okay
i got it
nic and jules get the hint
they move back and joni enters the room alone
nic and jules quietly turn and leave
joni stands among her bags and boxes looking around
she goes into her suitcase and pulls out her linens
she starts making her bed but suddenly stops mid way
she stares out toward the hallway
finally she moves to the doorway and looks out
she realizes her family isnt there
joni exits looking around to find her family
the station wagon is gone
she looks panicked
her pace quickens as she makes her way down a hill toward the road
finally joni sees the volvo heading towards her
the car pulls over to the curb and everyone gets out
joni looks vulnerable
she tries to cover it
whered you go
we had to move the car
i thought you left
we wouldnt leave without saying goodbye
give us some credit
and suddenly everyone realizes
this is it
its time to say goodbye
first laser comes up and hugs joni
its gonna be weird not having you at home
sorry to leave you alone with them
i can handle it
laser backs up
then the moms both come up and hug joni tears streaming down their faces
guys come on
beat look ill talk to you soon
joni tries to detach from the hug
but her moms wont let go
they keep holding her and crying
slowly their tears begin to break joni down
trapped in their loving embrace jonis feelings rise up unbidden overpowering her
she starts crying
the moms hold her tighter which makes her cry even harder
soon shes sobbing in her mothers arms as all the pressure resentment and anger shes felt starts seeping out of her
nic and jules feel their daughter letting go
they hold her tight to comfort her
they keep holding her until a calm sets in
the hug breaks apart
nic pushes the hair from jonis face
joni gives her moms one last smile
laser jules and nic get back in the car
joni stands watching as they drive off and her new life begins
the family drives home
jules is at the wheel
nics in the passenger seat eyes red and puffy
lasers in the back
no one speaks everyones lost in their own worlds
finally laser breaks the spell
i dont think you guys should break up
a long beat
i think youre too old
both nic and jules crack smiles
their sons rudeness is unsurpassed
but then his words have an unexpected gravity
jules disarmed and slightly smiling reaches over and puts her hand on nics leg
she gives it a gentle squeeze and doesnt let go
nic looks over to jules finally disarmed
nic reaches for jules hand and holds it tight
nic and jules look at each other and then away
laser watches his moms holding hands from the back seat
their small gesture is what he needed
he smiles to himself grateful for a sign
