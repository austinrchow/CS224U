href b b hannah and her sisters by woody allen as the last credit appears the song ends in a crescendo and the screen fades to total black
immediately a new melody begins an uptempo jazz number as a title appears on the screen
god shes beautiful
a full face of lee wearing a gray sweater and leaning against the dining room doorway
she gazes into the camera with a half smile on her face as elliot speaks over the screen
god shes beautiful
lee glances over her shoulder then turns from the doorway and walks away
the camera follows her moving across a book and photograph filled bookshelf that obscures her from view as she walks into a crowded comfortable vestibule
people some holding drinks some just entering the apartment surround her
everyone is talking at once carrying on easy familiar conversation
shes got the prettiest eyes and she looks so sexy in that sweater
lee smiles at the various people exchanging greetings
hi how are you
two more guests enter the apartment the vestibule is full now
still walking lee lightly hugs one of the children as she continues on her way towards the living room
elliots voice as well as the jazzy music is heard
i just want to be alone with her and hold her and kiss her
lee walks into the living room turning her head back for a moment to talk to the child she has just hugged
and tell her how much i love her and take care of her
stop it you idiot
shes your wifes sister
but i cant help it
the camera is still moving with lee as she smiles and stops to chat with her mother
elliots voice as well as the music continues over the low din of warm conversation
im consumed by her

sighing what am i gonna do
lee starts to walk off again finishing her conversation with her mother
she passes several other guests then turns to greet april giving her a warm brief hug

elliots voice over continues as he is actually seen standing in a doorway having a conversation with a gesturing rotund man
both are holding drinks as lee carrying a tray of hors doeuvres and two drinks walks between them
the space is very tight the men hold up their drinks to make room for her
squeezed past me in the doorway and i smelled that perfume on the back of her neck
elliot watches lee walk off the other man oblivious continues to talk
elliot reluctantly returns to the conversation but he cant help turning his head to gaze at the offscreen lee as the other man chatters on
jesus i i thought i was gonna swoon
the camera resumes following a smiling lee
she has just put down the tray and drinks near april and briskly and obliviously she walks past a doorway where elliot still ruminating watches her entranced
youre a dignified financial advisor

the camera stays with elliot who is still watching the offscreen lee
in the background guests continue to chatter warmly with each other
hannah carrying a tray of hors doeuvres walks up behind the distracted elliot

the film shows the doctorss hands turning the dials on a sonometer
mickey sits on a nearby high stool large earphones on his head
he listens with such concentration that he squints his eyes
he holds up a finger in response to the sounds he hears in his headset

abel hitting a large turning fork with his finger
he puts the vibrating fork to mickeys ear
mickey looking up at the offscreen doctors face nods
the music stops as the film cuts back to dr
abels consultation room

he talks to the offscreen mickey as he walks
well im sorry to say you have had a significant drop in the high decibel range of your right ear

a contemporary red building designed by david is seen squeezed in between two older buildings
holly april and david talk offscreen

the film moves down from the buildings to reveal the trio sitting in davids jaguar across the street
david and april sit in the front seat holly sits scrunched up in back her head slightly forward
gesturing looking back and forth from the buildings to holly and april the designs deliberately noncontextural
but i wanted to

pausing as he watches holly and aprils reaction oh
overlapping oh is that what it is
starting to speak uh interrupting nodding at holly i i it has an o organic quality you know

almost uhhh entirely wholly interdependent if you know what i mean

turning to april emphatically you know april people pass by vital structures in this city all the time and they never take the time to appreciate them
i get the feeling you tune in to your environment

david turns and briefly glances at holly he then turns back to april
looking only at david what are your favorite buildings david
you want to see some
nodding oh yeah
well lets do it
looking at david great
david starts the car and the movie cuts to an unfolding visual excursion through new york citys landmark buildings as seen from the trios point of view in the moving
inspiring classical music plays in the background
the series of shots includes the dakota complete with surrounding winter trees the graybar building on lexington avenue an incredibly ornate building on seventh avenue and fifty eighth street a
red stone church an old building with embellished bulging windows on west forty fourth street the art deco chrysler building a red brick building abigail adamss old stone house and the pomander walk nestled off broadway on the upper west side
the group can be seen walking down the path between the old fashioned row houses and shrubbery
a lamppost sits in the foreground
it is now dark
the music continues to play as the film cuts to the facade of a rococo style building complete with french doors and ornate windows
the admiring group is heard offscreen
offscreen oh its just so romantic

offscreen overlapping yes
offscreen continuing and open the french doors and go on the balcony offscreen interrupting its french though

the music stops
the screen which has been exploring the rococo buildings facade now shows the equally elegant building alongside it
offscreen and its got a handsome partner sitting right beside it
offscreen overlapping they fit right in together
and your eye goes along lulled into complacency and then
the film moves from the two elegant facade to show an ugly ultra modern structure covered with tiny diamond shaped motifs
offscreen thats just offscreen interrupting look at this
offscreen thats disgusting
offscreen continuing a monstrosity
who would do that
offscreen overlapping its really terrible
offscreen emphatically its really sad
offscreen and it ruins everything else

the film moves from the ugly facade to the buildings equally ugly entrance
a large car is parked right in front of the building
we have seen a lot of stuff today though
offscreen chuckling yeah
offscreen overlapping yeah

the group is now seen walking down the canopied entrance stairs of an apartment house on the other side of the street where theyd been gazing at both the lovely
and ugly facades across the way
david is in the lead the women follow holly slightly behind april

overlapping nodding great
they get into the car
once again hollys in the backseat
the classical music begins anew
the movie cuts briefly to cut to the traffic and lights of a manhattan avenue as seen from the moving jaguar
it then moves to a close up of holly sitting in the backseat her head near the window
she is staring straight ahead
naturally i get taken home first
well obviously he prefers april
of course i was so tongue tied all night
i cant believe i said that about the guggenheim
my stupid little roller skating joke

glaring at the offscreen aprils back where did april come up with that stuff about adolph loos and terms like organic form
looking out the side window pausing for a moment well naturally
she went to brandeis
the movie cuts to hollys point of view the front seat where david and april sit the jaguars windshield and the passing lights and traffic of the street
holly continues her ruminations as april leans over to say something to david
but i dont think she knows what shes talking about
could you believe the way she was calling him david
i feel that way too david
what a marvelous space david
emphatically i hate april
the film moves back to holly in the backseat still lost in thought

sighing looking out the side window and i really like him a lot
oh screw it
im not gonna get all upset
ive got reading to do tonight
you know maybe ill get into bed early
ill turn to a movie and take an extra seconal
the classical music stops and some uptempo jazz begins
the screen cuts to black and a title appears
nobody not even the rain has such small hands
the movie briefly holds on a ripped red paint splattered door as elliot wearing a raincoat appears nearby
he looks down the street and the film cuts to his point of view fredericks loft building
the movie goes back to the impatient elliot hes looking around him
he glances at his watch as the film cuts back once again to the loft building where lee finally appears walking down the street away from elliot
a truck passes down the street
lee doesnt see him
she walks further and further away she turns a corner
elliot frantically looks around again then in a burst of decision he runs around a garbage dump crossing the street and still running he moves down an adjacent street past
the canal lumber company and several other buildings as the film cuts back to lee walking down a different street oblivious
the jazz plays on as the movie cuts back and forth between the fast moving elliot rushing down the soho streets past a truck waiting for a light to change
past some pedestrians some garbage cans turning corners and the strolling lee walking up different streets past different buildings
lee eventually crosses a street lost in thought looking right and left as elliot pretending nonchalance waits on the corner looking at his watch
she looks up in surprise the music stops
trying not to sound out of breath oh my goodness
overlapping smiling in surprise oh elliot
smiling what are you doing here

chuckling thank you
they begin to walk again as the movie cuts to the interior of the pageant book print shop an old serious bookstore
a nude print hangs at the end of one of the library shelf like bookcases which are packed row after row with books
an unseen elliot and lee carry on a conversation as the camera moves down an aisle past the rows of books
a piano playing bewitched is heard
pictures hang on the aisle ends of the shelves
offscreen isnt this great

stepping closer to the curb and hailing a cab i know you would
pointing to the book and uh d dont forget the poem on page a hundred and twelve

a taxi pulls over to the curb they walk over to it
elliot opens the rear door for lee
she laughs as she gets in
leaning down to talk to lee in the cab page a hundred and twelve
closing the taxi door for lee bye
he watches the taxi pull away
lee in slacks and shirt is curled up on the bed her back to the camera as she reads the e
cummings poem in the glow of a night table lamp
the piano music is still heard
reading your slightest look easily will unclose me though i have closed myself as fingers you open always petal by petal myself
as lee continues to read aloud the movie cuts to elliots darkened den lit by a light in the hallway
elliot enters wearing a robe crossing the room in the dark
as spring opens touching skillfully mysteriously her first rose i do not know what it is about you that closes and opens only something in me understands the voice of
your eyes is deeper than all roses
elliot turns on a light
the camera stays on his face as he looks off into the distance mouthing indistinctly the line of poetry lee next reads
continuing reading nobody not even the rain has such small hands
the film leaves elliots face and cuts back to the loft where lee having finished the poem sits up in the bed staring pensively lost in her thoughts
the anxiety of the man in the booth
upbeat jazz begins to play and the film cuts to the facade of mount sinai hospital
it is day
a few cars whiz by as the film moves inside to various scenes depicting mickeys comprehensive exam
first is a hearing test and the movie cuts to a darkened hearing test room
a light goes on revealing a slouched over mickey sitting in a glass booth
he is wearing a set of headphones
the camera moves back revealing a technician at the console on the other side of the booth
mickey signals with his finger when he hears a sound on his headset
the jazz continues
next is an electronystagmography eng
graph paper rolls out of a machine and after a brief glimpse of the rolling paper the camera moves over to show mickey lying terrified without his glasses on a
couch with electrodes stuck all over his head
the film then cuts to a bser test room where mickey sitting in a corner chair wears another set of headphones
an electrode is attached to his forehead a nearby technician sits at a computer video screen looking at a monitoring graph
last but not least is the tomography
over the shoulders of a technician in a booth a large window displays a huge white rotating machine
it makes a whooshing noise as it turns
the camera moves down the giant cranelike device to reveal mickey once again lying down this time on a table his eyes closed underneath it
a sitting dr
grey his back to the camera is examining a group of x rays clipped to the light board behind his desk
i wasnt too happy with the results of your eng or your bser either
the doctor turns his chair around to face a tense mickey sitting on the other side of his desk
uh which is why i sent you to tomography which was all that stuff you saw rolling around
pointing to a spot on one of the x rays you see this little gray area here
mickey stares at the x ray horrified
that gray areas what i had hoped that we wouldnt run into
id like you to come in monday morning for uh a cat scan
reacting a brain scan
sachs lets take one step at a time
we wont make any decisions until we have all the information in front of us all right
mickey is seen leaving the hospital
he strides slowly his shoulders slouched his hands in his pockets
his voice is heard over the screen as he crosses the street continuing his self absorbed walk on the opposite side
occasional traffic goes by
take it easy
he didnt say you had anything
he just doesnt like the spot on your x ray thats all
it doesnt mean you have anything
dont jump to conclusions
sighing nothings gonna happen to you
youre in the middle of new york city
this is your town
youre surrounded by people and traffic and restaurants
mickey brushes against a heavyset man who gives him a nasty look
mickey is so dazed he doesnt even notice
i mean god how can you how can you just one day
youre gonna be okay
the dark bedroom is abruptly lit as mickey lying in his bed wakes up with a start and turns on his night table lamp
i know it
theres a spot on my lungs
sitting up putting on his glasses all right now take it easy will you
its not on your lungs
its on your ear
no its the same thing isnt it
pulling the sheets off and sitting on the edge of his bed oh jeez i cant sleep
oh god theres a tumor in my head the size of a basketball
putting on his slippers n now i keep thinking i can feel it every time i blink
he he he wants me to do a brain scan to confirm what he already suspects
mickey still ruminating stands up
fixing his pants he walks out of his bedroom loft into a dark upper hallway
running his hand along a banister look
ill make a deal with god
let it just be my ear okay
ill go deaf
ill go deaf and blind in one eye maybe
but i dont want a brain operation
once they go into my skull ill ill wind up like the guy with the with the wool cap who delivers for the florist
he walks down a spiral staircase into the dark living room
oh relax will ya
your whole life you run to doctors
the news is always fine
pausing at the bottom of the stairs thats not true
what about years ago
the film cuts to a flashback of mickeys past
smith sitting behind his desk faces the camera
rows of periodicals line the wall behind him
gesturing with one hand im sorry to say mr
sachs that you cannot have children
the camera moves to dr
smiths point of view hannah and mickey sitting on the opposite side of the desk
they look stunned
reacting putting his hands across his chest gee
reacting is there no chance
getting up from his desk well naturally this doesnt mean that you cant have a normal sex life
walking over to the opened office door and closing it but mr
sachss tests indicate that he is infertile
small sperm volume and infertile
the camera moves back to the stunned mickey and hannah following dr
smith with their eyes
gesturing looking up at an offscreen dr
smith isnt there anything i can do
push ups or hormones
offscreen im afraid not
well i gotta get a second opinion
turning to mickey this is the second opinion
shrugging well then a third opinion
smith walks back to his high backed leather chair behind the desk and sits down
as he talks the camera moves closer and closer to his face
i realize this is a blow
my experience is that many very fine marriages become unstable and are destroyed by an inability to deal with this sort of problem
i hope you wont make too much of it
one can adopt children and there are various artificial methods of fertilization
mickey and hannah walk on the sidewalk oblivious of the passing pedestrians
hannah crying blows her nose
gesturing im so humiliated
i dont know what to say
i mean interrupting wiping her eyes with her tissue could you have ruined yourself somehow
gesturing how could i ruin myself
what do you mean ruin myself
overlapping looking at mickey i dont know
hey you gonna start knocking my hobbies
hannah sobs clutching her tissue to her face
maybe maybe we can adopt a child
he said you could adopt one interrupting well what about artificial insemination
gesturing what are you talking about
overlapping you know where i i i would get implanted from a a donor
reacting what by a st stranger
deep in conversation they cross a tree lined street
they pass a yellow wood frame house bordered by a wrought iron fence
yeah they have these banks you know where they keep them frozen
you want a a defrosted kid

they walk offscreen and the film cuts to hannah and mickeys living room
the room is brightly lit its cluttered with pillows and plants
norman and carol his wife sit on the couch drinking coffee
putting down her cup oh that was a wonderful show
i think thats the best show you two ever wrote
holding his cup pointing emphatically no the funniest show that mickey and i ever did was the one we won the emmy for
mickey walks from the kitchen into the living room holding a half eaten chocolate cake on a serving plate
the sun pours through the windows he passes
hannah is briefly seen in the background preparing more coffee in the kitchen
i i think as i think as far as laughs i mean just plain laughs you know that was probably the best thing that we ever did
mickey puts the cake down on the coffee table which is already crowded with assorted plants plates and a bamboo tray holding utensils and napkins
agreeing mm hm
overlapping her hands over her crossed knees and nodding yeah it was funny it was very funny
but the show was about the two frenchmen now that was funny and it was warm
mickey sighs and flops down on an adjoining couch
he rubs his forehead
to carol gesturing with his cup we got that idea on that trip to paris
to the offscreen hannah do you remember that summer in france
hannah you had jet lag for six straight weeks
sighing almost mumbling yeah but it was you know i guess we had fun when we were there and you know its just i overlapping nodding mm hm
hannah walks over to the group holding a pot of coffee
she awkwardly steps past mickey to pour coffee for norman and carol
to mickey sorry

holding out his cup mmm
refilling normans cup we we
we had something we we really wanted to discuss with you

she puts the pot down on the coffee table and sits down next to mickey
standing up and gesturing jeez this is this is this is very delicate and and i only bring this up amongst friends you know
he starts to pace
hannah her hands clasped near her face glances briefly at carol
turning to the group as he paces behind the couch i mean
grunting this is uh
this should not go any further than this room
sipping his coffee im all ears
mickey pauses for a moment collecting his thoughts
gesturing and pacing hannah and i
cant have any children
now i i i dont want to get into whose fault it gesturing its my fault that we cant and and and the details are too embarrassing to interrupting nervously
picking at her fingers w w we weve decided after a lot of discussion that we wed try with artificial insemination
mickey stops his pacing and looks at the group
putting his hands on his hips yeah im not so sure that i that i like that idea myself anyway he starts to pace behind the couch anew
overlapping um i i didnt really want to you know go to a sperm bank or something have some anonymous donor
gesturing at norman and carol i i just you know i i i wouldnt want that
we felt that if we were gonna do it that we would like somebody who we knew and who we liked and who was warm and bright and
norman and carol remain silent
and you can say no
feel free to say no
w we realize it has all kinds of implications
mickey stops pacing and leans on the couch behind norman
yeah but the the point that uh that were making here is that we need some sperm
mickey rubbing his hands on his knees leans back against the wall
norman and carol turn to each other reacting
my first reaction after the initial shock is uh flattered that you would ask me
chuckling nervously carol glances at norman
pointing at himself yeah well i would be the father
pointing to norman you would just have to masturbate into a little cup
shrugging i can handle that
scooting closer to carol and norman on the couch gesturing obviously we wou wouldnt have intercourse
she chuckles nervously
to hannah chuckling nervously briefly gosh listen
rubbing her nose ive gotta tell you the truth here
im a little uneasy about this
putting her hand on carols shoulder carol i know its a lot to ask

holding his coffee cup thoughtful i gave blood before and uh
clothing to the poor
to norman scratching her ear okay norman listen i really want to talk about this at home
nodding as hannah looks briefly offscreen at mickey i think its a matter for your analyst
emphatically and maybe my lawyer
he takes a sip of coffee
gesturing you know we we understand completely if you know if you feel youd youd rather not
chuckling nervously i didnt mean to spoil the evening
rubbing her hands now lets move on to another topic
hannah reaches for the cake as carol and norman exchange glances reacting
the flashback ends
mickey is back in the present in his darkened living room illuminated by a glow from a window behind the couch
a coffee table sits in front of the couch
papers are scattered on the floor
mickey gets up from the couch where hed been sitting
he paces back and forth as he talks over the screen
so you had my ex partners baby
maybe that did cause some trouble but sighing i think we were drifting apart anyhow
now instead of man and wife were just good friends
boy love is really unpredictable
manon lescaut is being performed
onstage the soprano in the title role sings a mournful aria as she kneels by the ruins of a wagon
the background is dark
the film moves up to the private boxes in the upper loge
david and holly can be seen from a distance sitting in one of the boxes
david glances at her he reaches down for a bottle of wine
the movie briefly cuts back to the stage
the soprano is leaning on a wagon wheel her voice soars
then its back to a closer look at holly and david in their box
the aria continues as david hands a smiling holly a glass
he uncorks the wine and pours some in both their glasses
holly mouths a thank you glancing around
they look at each other and raise their glasses in a toast
dusty bought this huge house in southampton
the opera audience is heard cheering applauding and sounding their bravos
the clapping stops as the movie cuts to fredericks loft
it is day
lee wearing a baggy plaid shirt and jeans has opened the door for elliot and his client wealthy rock star dusty frye
leading the way into the loft gesturing lee frederick
say hello to dusty frye
lee closes the door behind the men and walks over to dusty
shaking dustys hand hi dusty
lee chuckles as she looks at him he is wearing sunglasses a red imprinted t shirt and a baggy coat
she turns and walks with frederick elliot and dusty farther into the loft her hands clasped behind her back
as he walks dustys just bought a huge house in southampton and hes in the process of decorating it
its kind of a weird place actually
a lotta wall space
they walk into the living room area of the loft where frederick his hands in his pockets neatly attired in vest sweater and white shirt stands waiting
to frederick giving him a hip handshake how ya doin man
to a less than enthusiastic frederick i told him about your work and hes very excited
yeah i got an andy warhol
and i got a frank stella too
oh its very beautiful
gesturing big weird
chuckling as he crosses his arms on his chest if you stare at that stella too long the colors just seem to float
its kinda weird
frederick covers his face to hide his disgust
chuckling her arms crossed are you excited about becoming a collector
shrugging i got a lot more to learn though
i really wasnt into art when i was a kid
nodding uh huh
addressing but not looking at dusty do you appreciate drawings
chuckling as he notices and points to some offscreen drawings frederick has set up oh
pointing to an offscreen nude drawing shes beautiful
but uh really i i i i need something
im looking for something big
as dusty talks the camera follows elliot who walks past the others to examine the drawings more closely
two framed nude drawings of lee are propped up on an easel
elliot glances admiringly at the drawings then surreptitiously at lee admiring her body as she converses with an offscreen dusty and frederick
looking at an offscreen frederick gesturing big
frederick show him the oils
offscreen theyre in the basement
the camera leaves elliot to follow the enthusiastic lee as she takes dusty by the arm and starts leading him to the door
frederick follows at a distance
to dusty fredericks done this whole new series that im sure you would really love
overlapping muttering well are
are they big
some of them
yeah some of them are very big
cause i got a lot of wall space there
chuckling angrily stopping in his tracks i dont sell my work by the yard
chuckling reacting oh frederick
the camera now moves back to elliot still staring at the nude drawings as the sounds of fredericks and dustys footsteps are heard leaving the loft
he turns and hesitantly smiles to an offscreen lee
chuckling softly hows everything
walking onscreen towards elliot oh you know
i talked to hannah this morning on the phone and she said that you two might be going to the country for the weekend
yeah she loves to go out in the woods
nodding her arms clasped around her chest oh yeah
chuckling but i go nuts
its a conflict
lee uneasy looks down
i have to get my teeth cleaned this week
oh thats nice
theres an awkward moment of silence
breaking the silence pointing in the direction of the door i figured id get uh frederick and dusty together
looking in the same direction gesturing oh yeah thats really nice of you
this kid hes earned a trillion dollars
nodding wrapping her arms around her chest again oh
hes got like six gold records
gesturing relieved that shes found something to say oh speaking of records
i bought that mozart trio you recommended
the camera follows lee as she walks quickly to the stereo unit pulling a record off the shelf
continuing and the man in the record shop showed me another one that i think youd love
another bach second movement
she pulls the record out of its jacket and puts it on the turntable
offscreen oh you you have that one
working at the stereo turning her head towards elliot yeah
offscreen oh i would love to hear it
bachs concerto for harpsichord fills the room
putting the turntable cover in place oh and holly met a wonderful man who loves opera
offscreen oh thats nice
id love to see her wind up settled
shes a tense one
chuckling the record in place lee turns and leans back against the stereo unit
she listens to the music her eyes closed
the record plays for a few moments in the quiet room as elliot walks over to lee and leans against the shelf near her
intently isnt that beautiful
looking at lee his hands clasped in front of him i know this
f minor concerto
its one of my favorites
lee smiling continues to listen to the music her head down elliot stares at her
after a pause uh
did you ever get around to e
wrapping her arms around her chest and looking away from elliot for a moment yes hes just adorable
awkwardly they have a very large gay clientele you know where i get my teeth cleaned and
all the hygienists now wear gloves because theyre afraid of aids
taking a breath oh right
there is another moment of silence
elliot stares at lee who continues to look down her arms around her chest
the harpsichord plays on
softly did you ever get around to the poem on page a hundred and twelve
yes it made me cry tentatively looking at elliot it was so beautiful
lee looks down again the music plays softly and elliot continues to stare at her thinking
i want so badly to kiss her
not here you idiot
youve got to get her alone someplace
as elliots thoughts are heard over the scene lee glances around the loft then begins to walk away
the camera follows her as she goes past the nude drawings which become the focus of attention as lee walks offscreen
but ive got to proceed cautiously
this is a very delicate situation
ask her if you can see her for lunch or a drink tomorrow
lee walks back onscreen to the bookshelf behind the drawings
she takes the e
cummings book from the shelf and flips through it as she walks back to elliot who is still leaning by the stereo still ruminating
and be ready to make light of the offer if shes unresponsive
this has to be done very skillfully very diplomatically
showing elliot a poem in her book did you ever read this one
elliot leaps up grabs lee and kisses her passionately
lee surprised pushes him away
lee im in love with you
he kisses lee again
he clumsily turns around she humps against the stereo unit
as lee pulls away she smashes into the turntable
the needle scratches loudly
lee shocked is gasping
the record pushed to a different part of the concerto now plays a more complicated faster fugue
breathing hard oh
gasping what are you doing
im im im im sorry
i have to talk to you for
theres so much that i want to tell you
lee stares at elliot in shock
still gasping elliot
gesturing desperately i have been in love with you for so long
frederick and dustys indistinct voices raised in argument are suddenly heard
elliot quickly turns away from lee
she tries to compose herself and the film cuts to the loft entranceway
frederick enters the loft first followed by a confused dusty
they stride across the loft past lee who is standing by the stereo
elliot standing near the nude drawings is looking through a book
angrily please forget it
i dont have any interest in selling anything
gesturing i ask you if you have something with a little puce in it you gotta fly off the handle
in a slightly higher pitched voice whats the problem
pulling the nude drawings off his easel angrily im not interested in what your interior decorator would think okay
overlapping gesturing well i cant commit to anything without consulting her first
thats what i have her for okay
carrying the drawings off this is degrading
you dont buy paintings to blend in with the sofa
looking after frederick its not a sofa its an ottoman
touching his forehead turning to elliot god forget it
lets just get outta here elliot
putting down the book well go
the film moves outside the loft building
dusty and elliot emerge and walk to dustys waiting limousine
elliot is rubbing his forehead anguished
angrily getting into the car what a weirdo that guy is
noticing elliots anguished face whats the matter with you
gesturing look i i ill be okay

overlapping its not that big a deal
we just didnt hit it off
gesturing now look you you you go on ahead

overlapping nervously yeah

ill ill walk

dusty settles down in the backseat and closes the door
elliot leans down to the chauffeurs window signaling for him to start driving
continuing gesturing you go
the limousine drives off
elliot runs to a phone booth across the street
he picks up the phone and dials
the film cuts to frederick in his loft standing near the phone
frederick picks it up
into the telephone hello
when no one answers frederick reacting hangs up and the film moves back outside to the phone booth where elliot the phone receiver to his ear listens for a moment
then hangs up
he walks out of the booth reacting then walks down the sidewalk where he bumps into a frantic lee just turning the corner
gesturing in relief oh
there you are
elliot mumbles relieved and confused
i was looking for you
gesturing i i must apologize
i im i im sorry
im so mixed up
gesturing well how do you expect me to react to such a thing
elliot uneasy glances up in the direction of fredericks loft
he leads lee a few yards up the street away from any prying eyes
taking lees arm wh uh i know i know but i am in love with you
oh dont say those words
overlapping shaking his head i i im sorry
i know its terrible
pushing back her hair shaking her head hopelessly why you know the situation
looking away for a moment i know

hannah and i are in the last stages
shaking her head wh shes never said anything and were very close
shed tell me such a thing
wh it it it it its so sad
shes crazy about me but somewhere on the along the line ive fallen out of love with her
not because of me i hope

oh i cant be the cause of anything between you and hannah
i jus overlapping shaking his head oh no no no

tch w well for a million reasons
gesturing but not over me
we were we were both going in different directions
looking down poor hannah
but but but how about you
do you do you share any of my feelings
or is this just an unpleasant embarrassment to you
reacting uneasily i cant say anything
w well please be candid
i i i dont want you to feel bad
putting her hand to her head yes
i have certain feelings for you but dont make me say anything more all right
lee looks at him
gesturing o o o okay lee

shaking her head i live with frederick and hannah and i are close
yes but you you do care about me
reacting oh elliot please
i cant be a party to this
im suddenly wracked with guilt just standing her talking to you on the street
emphatically your guilt is because you feel the same
reacting oh please i have to go
i have to get my teeth cleaned
she walks off
elliot stares after her grinning
happily i have my answer
i have my answer
im walking on air
a taxi turns a west side street corner and stops in front of evan and normas building which is decorated with a long metal awning
its an overcast day
a station wagon on the opposite side of the street pulls away as hannah a white scarf fluttering over her shoulder gets out of the cab
she runs into the building the taxi drives away
a piano plays bewitched over the screen
evan his back to the camera walks to the front door and opens it to hannah
hows she doing
overlapping i am glad to see you
hannah takes off her shoulder bag and her coat as her aggravated father walks past her towards the kitchen
he passes a wall with an ornate mirror and some framed photographs
shes in the kitchen there
its the same thing
she promises promises
gesturing but its all lies
through a doorway norma can be seen sitting on a chair in the kitchen
she wears a robe over a slip and stockings shes drinking
evan stands in the doorway looking at her he doesnt go in
offscreen patiently dont make it worse dad
hannah hurriedly passes her father and enters the kitchen her mother takes a sip of her drink
how you doing
here let me get you some coffee
thats enough of that
taking away her mothers drink to evan what triggered it
gesturing as norma turns her head and watches him we were making a commercial down at the mayors office and there was this young good looking salesman
norma reacts turning to her daughter
hannah however has her back turned
she is busy taking charge in the kitchen as evan speaks
she takes some pills out of a cupboard and hands them to her mother with a glass of water
continuing and your mother was throwing herself at him in a disgusting way and when she found she was too old to seduce him that he was just embarrassed by
her angrily interrupting turning her head liar
the camera moves to evan who continues to tell his story ignoring his wifes outburst as he walks away from the kitchen doorway into the den
then at lunch she got drunker and drunker shouting over his shoulder and finally she became joan collins
evan walks over to the piano where several framed family photographs sit in a line on its top
he picks one up as norma speaks offscreen in the kitchen
offscreen all my life ive had to put up with insults
the camera moves back to the kitchen as norma talks
she is still glaring offscreen at the doorway where evan stood moments before
she holds the water glass and the pills
continuing dramatically from this non person this th th this haircut that passes for a man
turning to look at the offscreen hannah he could never support us
its a good thing we had a talented daughter
evan is back in the doorway listening to norma getting more and more angry
as he makes a retort he starts to walk back to the den and his piano
i can only hope that she was mine
with you as her mother gesturing his voice getting louder her father could be anybody in actors equity
so its not likely shes yours
taking a sip of water walking over to the doorway to speak to evan whos already fuming in the den dad could you just please stay in the other room
and let me take care of her
hannah goes back to norma she takes the glass of water away
offscreen choosing to ignore hannahs suggestion you never know when shes going to fall off the wagon and humiliate everybody
hannah choosing to ignore evans remark hands her mother a cup of coffee she puts her mothers hands on the cup
leaning against a kitchen counter you know youre awful
you probably were flirting
sipping her coffee no
i like to joke around and have fun and he gets angry because i get the attention
hes gotten sourer as hes gotten older and ive tried to stay young
you promised to stay on the wagon
shaking her head the sacrifices ive made because of that man
inhaling hes ruined me with his ego his philandering his gesturing his his his his mediocrity
okay stop being so dramatic
shouting to the offscreen evan hes the one thats made every ingenue in stock
quietly okay okay
touching hannahs arm gasping th th they they wanted me for a screen test
patiently yeah i know mom
gesturing but i i knew that hed get up there and hed flounder around with his expensive haircuts and hairdos and clothes
hes all show
touching hannahs arm again then touching her chest now how can you act when theres nothing inside to come out
norma sips her coffee softly sobbing
hannah reacting walks away from the counter and capping the bottle of pills puts them back in the cupboard
evan plays the piano offscreen
the camera moves in on hannahs face as she reflects her voice heard over the screen
she was so beautiful at one time and he was so dashing
both of them just full of promise and hopes that never materialized
the camera leaves hannahs face as she continues to reflect it moves to the den to the row of family photos on the piano one of a present day evan
and norma others where both norma and evan are young beautiful hopeful
the music plays on
and the fights and the constant infidelities to prove themselves
and blaming each other
its s sad
they loved the idea of having us kids but raising us didnt interest them much
but its impossible to hold it against them
they didnt know anything else
the film cuts back to the kitchen
norma stands up hannah takes her coffee cup and sets it on the counter
you know of all of us in the family you were the one blessed with the true gift
she puts her arm around hannahs shoulder
mother and daughter walk out of the kitchen
holding the hand her mother had placed on her shoulder ohhh my true gift is luck mom
overlapping i just had a lot of luck
from my first show you know
ive always thought lee was the one destined for great things
yes shes lovely but she doesnt have your spark
gesturing and chuckling she knows it
she worships you
she wouldnt dare get up there on the stage
looking at her mother now hollys not shy
they stop at the entrance to the den
evan can be seen playing the piano as they continue their conversation
no hollys game for anything
holly takes after me
shaking her head id have been a great dope addict
hannah laughs touching her mother
they walk over to evan at the piano
looking up remember this hannah
evan plays a few bars of you are too beautiful as mother and daughter their backs to the camera listen
norma leans over the piano hannah looks off into the distance deep in reflection
the piano music continues in the background as the movie cuts to lee walking along a wharf by the waterfront
the wind blows her hair she hugs the e
cummings book to her chest
she too is deep in thought
she stops at the edge of the wharf the camera continues to move to a group of wooden pilings nearby lapped by the water
the piano piece ends and the film is quiet
the quiet continues as the film cuts to a close up of a large circular cat scan module in an antiseptic hospital room
a slowly moving stretcher bearing mickeys strapped prone body begins to enter the round opening of the module
as the camera pulls back from mickey his taped head under the scan two technicians can be seen through the window separating the scanner from the control room
one of them sitting down taps information into a computer while the other technician stands nearby looking from mickey to the computer screen
the movie then cuts briefly to the computer screen showing an image of mickeys skull
scan lines bleep over the skull
the camera moves up from the screen to reveal mickey once again as seen through the window silent and serious under the cat scan module
from mickeys prone form the film moves to the two technicians as seen through the window in the scanner room
they examine the computer screen and talk indistinctly to each other
one of the men nodding taps more information into the computer
while theyre studying the cat scan picture the camera cuts to a back view of mickey under the module
there is a science fiction feel to this scene as if mickey is lying in the center of a huge white futuristic circle
the stretcher bearing mickey slowly moves out of the module
brooks holding mickeys x rays walks past a row of bookshelves to his light panel
he props up the x rays
sachs sighing im afraid the news is not good
brooks turns to an offscreen mickey
continuing taking a pencil out of his pocket if i can show you exactly where the tumor is and why we feel that surgery would be of no use
the film quickly cuts to a close up of mickeys face reacting in total despair
he closes his eyes he covers his face with his hand
im face to face with eternity
offscreen grown quite large without being detected
trailing off indistinctly as mickey continues his anguished ramblings not later but now
im so frightened i cant move speak or breathe
as mickey finishes his speech the real dr
brooks is seen walking into the office
the previous scene had been a figment of mickeys imagination a nightmare fantasy only
holding mickeys x rays the real dr
brooks walks past the same row of books to the light panel
well youre just fine
theres absolutely nothing here at all
and your tests are all fine
switching on the light on the panel and propping up the x rays i must admit i was concerned given your symptoms
turning to look at the offscreen mickey what caused this hearing loss in one ear i guess well never really know for sure
but whatever it was its certainly not anything serious at all
nodding im very relieved
once again mickey is seen leaving the building but this time he bounds down the steps jumping for joy
he runs swirling down the street clapping his hands happy with relief
upbeat uptempo jazz plays in the background
several cars pass as mickey joyfully runs
suddenly he stops his hand to his mouth reflecting
gail sits in a chair in front of a bookshelf
a sofa a coffee table holding periodicals and an endtable with a lamp complete the tableau
gails hands are clasped on her lap
what do you mean youre quitting
the news is good
you dont have canc the thing
mickey standing behind his desk his back to the camera his coat still on looks out at the manhattan skyline
do you realize what a thread were all hanging by
offscreen mickey youre off the hook
you should be celebrating
walking around to the front of his desk gesturing can you understand how meaningless everything is
im talking about nnnn our lives the show
the whole world its meaningless
but youre not dying
no im not dying now but but gesturing you know when i ran out of the hospital i i was so thrilled because they told me i was going to
be all right
and im running down the street and suddenly i stop cause it hit me all right so you know im not going to go today
im not going to go tomorrow
pointing but eventually im going to be in that position
gail gets up from her chair
she walks past mickey to a nearby cabinet
she opens a drawer rummaging around for something
the camera follows her leaving mickey briefly
youre just realizing this now
offscreen well i dont realize it now i know it all the time but but i managed to stick it in the back of my mind
as mickey continues to talk offscreen gail closes the cabinet drawer and walks to a file cabinet behind mickeys desk
because it its a very horrible thing to
gail opens the file cabinet and takes out a pack of gum
she slams it closed distracted
turning to gail can i tell you something
can i tell you a secret
nodding impatiently as she walks around the desk yes please
pointing a week ago i bought a rifle
sitting on the arm of a chair near mickey no
overlapping nodding and gesturing i went into a store i bought a rifle
i was gonna
you know if they told me that i had a tumor i was going to kill myself
the only thing that mighta stopped me mightve is my parents would be devastated
i would i woulda had to shoot them also first
and then i have an aunt and uncle i would have
you know it would have been a bloodbath
shrugging unwrapping a stick of gum tch well you know eventually it it is going to happen to all of us
yes but doesnt that ruin everything for you
that makes everything
she pops a piece of gum into her mouth as mickey continues to speak
continuing you know it it just takes the pleasure out of everything
gesturing pointing i mean youre gonna die im gonna die the audience is gonna die the networks gonna the sponsor
chewing i know i know and your hamster
nodding emphatically yes
chewing and pointing to mickey listen kid i think you snapped your cap
continuing chewing loudly maybe you need a few weeks in bermuda or something
or go to a whorehouse
shaking his head his hand to his chest i cant stay on this show
i gotta get some answers
otherwise pausing and holding his head im telling you im going to do something drastic
the entrance to the st
regis hotel elegant and warmly lit in the night
baroque harpsichord music plays over the scene
the camera moves up the hotels facade past its welcoming flags to its ornate windows several floors up
as the harpsichord continues to play the film moves inside to one of the hotel rooms
elliot his back to the camera is opening the door to lee
elliot closes the door behind her as she enters
they stand very close to each other framed by the door and a stark subtly striped wallpapered wall
looking intensely at lee his hands in his pockets i thought you werent coming
i almost didnt
putting his hand on her shoulder wanting to kiss her lee
i didnt sleep all night
taking his hand away gesturing to the room no no no no im sure
they walk towards the camera further into the room
elliot puts his arm around lee
what are we doing meeting in a hotel room
its terrible isnt it
the music stops
the camera follows lee as she walks towards the curtained windows past a fireplace a mirror some innocuous pictures a delicate table holding a lamp the foot of the bed
offscreen i i couldnt think where to invite you without taking risks
i promised myself i wouldnt let this happen till you were living alone
i was so torn when you called
she parts a corner of the curtains looking out the window turning when elliot speaks
offscreen ive wanted to call you everyday since i first told you how i felt
he walks over to lee by the curtained windows
i resisted so many times
pausing dont think badly of me
he takes lee into his arms
this is not an easy situation
whispering i know it isnt
they kiss their figures almost silhouetted in the warm glow of the room
elliot takes lees coat off without breaking the kiss
they kiss each other lightly then stronger more passionately their embrace much tighter
and its later that night
the harpsichord music begins to play again as the camera moves over the bed covers to reveal lee lying contentedly under the sheets her hair fanned out on the pillows
one arm near her head
that was just perfect
youve ruined me for anyone else
offscreen i dont want anyone else ever to have you
sighing i was so worried i wouldnt compare with hannah
offscreen laughing oh my god
he enters the screen sitting down on the edge of the bed next to lee
he holds a cigarette
you really do have those thoughts dont you
chuckling touching elliots arm oh all the time
elliot chuckles they hold hands
i know she must be a really passionate person
looking at their clasped hands yes shes shes very warm but but it its me that wants to be giving to you
i i i want to do things for you
hannah doesnt need me as much
chuckling as lee laughs im being presumptuous
not that you need me
nodding i want you to take care of me
and i love when you do things to me
elliot leans down to lee they begin to kiss passionately
lee walks along the sidewalk in the rain shes bareheaded
the streets are dark
a car drives by a pedestrian passes holding an umbrella
lee passes a restaurant well lit inside by hanging lamps
the baroque music continues as she enters the loft her head soaked
she closes the door touching her soaking hair
offscreen youre late
lee walks through the lofts living room area unbelting her coat towards the bathroom
she passes frederick who sits at a table in the kitchen area drinking a cup of coffee and reading the paper
a plate with a half eaten sandwich sits in front of him
the music stops
opening the bathroom door lucy and i kept talking and i didnt realize how late it had gotten
barely glancing up from his paper you missed a very dull tv show about auschwitz
more gruesome film clips
and more puzzled intellectuals declaring their mystification over the systematic murder of millions
as he talks lee is seen turning on the bathroom light
she takes off her coat hanging it on a hook then begins to dry her hair with a towel
turning his head slightly in lees direction and gesturing the reason why they could never answer the question how could it possibly happen
is that its the wrong question
given what people are the question is swallowing why doesnt it happen more often

she starts to take off her wet clothes by the bed
frederick takes off his glasses

lee fraught with emotion briefly puts her outstretched hands on the refrigerator door then turns around and leans against it hugging herself her blouse still unbuttoned her hair still wet

laying her head against his shoulder sighing deeply its not sexual anymore
its certainly not intellectual
i mean youre so superior to me in every way that frederick furiously shakes lee away
he pounds his fist against a cupboard
lee gasping moves away
please dont patronize me
he puts his hand on his forehead then turns to the offscreen lee
i should have married you years ago when you wanted to
i should have agreed
he walks over to lee in another area of the kitchen
sighing oh god dont you know it never would have worked
frederick turns away from lee
he begins to pace near the counter
i told you one day you would leave me
leaning on the counter for a younger man
i he loudly pounds his fist on the counter in despair and frustration then covers his eyes with his hands in sorrow
hannah wearing a plaid shirt sits up in bed a book propped up on her knees
a cupboard with some bric a brac is mounted behind the night table which holds a small white warm glowing lamp and some photographs
she turns the page as elliot in pajamas and silk bathrobe enters
she continues to read her book as he sits down at the edge of the bed and muses
his voice is heard over the screen
what passion today with lee
shes a volcano
it was a totally fulfilling experience
just as i dreamed it would be
nodding slightly as he takes off his slippers thats what it was
it was like living out a dream
a great dream
taking off his bathrobe now i feel very good and cozy being here next to hannah
theres something very lovely and real about hannah
tossing his bathrobe aside and lying down on the bed next to hannah his hands crossed over his stomach she gives me a very deep feeling of being part of
shes a wonderful woman
and i betrayed her
she came into my empty life and changed it
and i paid her back by banging her sister in a hotel room

sitting up i have to call her now and tell her what we did was crazy
anxiously it cant ever happen again

elliot walks quickly into the darkened hallway
muttering what if he answers
turning into the doorway leading to the living room ill hang up
walking into the darkened living room ill tell her we cant communicate until i terminate my marriage
whispering its immoral
elliot switches on the light
he paces back and forth in front of the piano and an accompanying music stand
the top of the piano is filled with family photos the lamp he turned on illuminates some framed pictures on the wall and the piece of sheet music open on
gesturing and whispering then time will pass
i wont call and shell get the idea
i gotta stop this before i get in too deep
id rather hurt lee a little than destroy hannah
elliot stops pacing and checks his wristwatch

the phone rings
loudly to the offscreen hannah gasping ive got it

the movie cuts to lee standing in the dark in fredericks loft
she talks softly into the telephone
into the telephone i would have hung up if you hadnt answered and i promise i wont ever do this again but i just had to tell you i feel
very close to you tonight
very very close
pausing good night
lee hangs up the phone and the movie cuts back to elliot standing in his living room
stunned he slowly lowers the phone receiver
the only absolute knowledge attainable by man is that life is meaningless
tolstoy jazz is heard as the movie cuts to the outside of a university library the camera focused on a huge replica of rodins thinker before moving to the front
mickey can be seen emerging from its depths
he wears his raincoat his hands are in his pockets
he ponders the scene as he walks past the statue and a small front garden and down the sidewalk
passersby some holding books are seen
millions of books written on every conceivable subject by all these great minds and and in the end none of em knows anything more about the big questions of life
than i do
ss i read socrates
you know n n n this guy used to kn knock off little greek boys
what the hells he got to teach me
and and nietzsche with his with his theory of eternal recurrence
he said that the life we live were gonna live over and over again the exact same way for eternity
that means i uh ill have to sit through the ice capades again
its not worth it
the movie next cuts to a sunny day in central park
a male jogger seen through some tree branches runs by
the camera moves past him revealing a pondering mickey walking by the reservoir
he continues to talk over the screen
and and freud another great pessimist
jeez i was in analysis for years
my poor analyst got so frustrated
the guy finally put in a salad bar
several joggers pass mickey he continues to ruminate
look at all these people jogging
trying to stave off the inevitable decay of the body
boy smacking his lips its so sad what people go through with their their stationary bike and their exercise and their
glancing at a fat woman jogger in a red sweatsuit who runs by oh
look at this one
my god she has to tote all that fat around
maybe the poets are right
maybe love is the only answer
mickey goes over to the chain link fence encircling the reservoir
he stops walking and looks out over the water
shh of course i was in love with hannah
that didnt work out too well
sighing i even took her sister out
mickey continues to look through the fence at the water and the distant skyline
a jogger crosses in front of him
its very quiet the soft jazz continues
remember years ago when hannah and i got divorced and she fixed me up with her sister holly
the film cuts abruptly to mickeys flashback of his date with holly beginning with a rock club performance
the soft jazz becomes loud pulsating rock
three punkers a girl with pink hair a girl with a spiked mohawk and a guy with stevie wonder braids and sunglasses watch and bop their heads to the sounds
of the offscreen rock band the steps
the camera moves to the stage revealing a sleazy looking rock band in the midst of their number
singing i want to be like you i said im going to fit into your group
as the band loudly plays on the camera moves across the spellbound audience sitting at crowded smoky small tables to reveal a stricken mickey and a mesmerized holly squeezed together
at one of them
a nearby member of the audience swills beer from a bottle
holly beating time to the music and enjoying herself takes a puff of her cigarette
she wears a wristful of silver bracelets
she glances at mickey impatiently
hes the only one in the place wearing a suit
singing i dont wanna be different said im gonna be just like you because im gonna buy the records that they play on radio
holly turns back to the band who are still in full swing
the camera moves down the body of the lead singer singing into a microphone from his longish curly red hair through his cut off red shirt and sweaty torso to
he wears several silver bracelets on his wrists and gold bracelets on his upper arm
the microphone screeches feedback
singing im gonna dance at clubs gonna do just what im told because im bleedin now and im bleedin now i wanna slip slip slip slip slip into the crowd
i wanna slip slip slip slip slip into the crowd
the camera moves back to holly and the even more stricken looking mickey
they are crowded in with people
in the background a waitress holds up a tray
a man drinks from a glass mug people chatter indistinctly over the loud band
the club is noisy smoky and thick with people
holly glances at mickey once again this time unable to contain her annoyance
oh why are you making those faces
leaning over to holly gesturing i cant hear you
i cant hear anything
im im im im gonna lose hearing in my ear
im interrupting gesturing to the offscreen band listen you are witnessing genius
pointing to his ears i i my ears are experiencing a meltdown

while mickey pleads with her holly puts her cocaine vial into her purse
she holds a finger against one nostril and sniffs
she then picks up her lit cigarette and continues to smoke
can we can we go
looking at the offscreen hand bopping her head to the music and smoking no
touching his ear in pain my uh
the camera leaves the crowded tables and moves back to the band
the lead singers continues to sing with his band swaying his body to the music
gonna buy the records that they play on the radio
as the film cuts abruptly to outside the rock club
the music has stopped
mickey and holly almost in dark silhouette are walking at a fast clip along the sidewalk arguing
they pass some lighted clothing store windows a few cars go by in the dark street
enthusiastically i love songs about extraterrestrial life dont you
not when theyre sung by extraterrestrials
impatiently with annoyance oh well i cannot communicate with you
i you know i never realized you were such a tightass
i cant understand you

i dont know where you went went wrong
gesturing do you mind

they stop briefly at a street corner and look for oncoming cars before crossing
mickey takes hollys arm as they walk across the street towards the camera
angrily im not angry

its like im dating cardinal cooke
bobby short is playing im in love again on the piano accompanied by a bass player
an art deco mural fills the wall behind him
singing why am i just as reckless as a child
why am i like a racehorse running wild
why am i in a state of ecstasy
the reason is cause somethings happened to me im in love again and the spring is comin
as the camera leaves the musicians and moves to the conversatively dressed audience
a far cry from the rock club atmosphere the carlyle is quiet except for bobby shorts singing
the audience at their tables watch him some with smiles of pleasure
a man has his arm around a woman
jewels sparkle in another womans hair
the men wear suits
mickey and holly sit at one of the tables a candle burns in its holder on the tabletop
holly takes a cigarette from her purse as she holds her hand to her nose sniffing
mickey keeps shooting glances at holly she cant sit still
bobby short continues to sing
singing im in love again hear my heart strings strummin im in love again and the hymn theyre hummin is those cuddle up huddle up blues im in love again
and i cant rise above it
as holly lights her cigarette dropping her matchbook on the floor
she bends down to pick it up then starts to fidget in her chair
she gulps her wine she sniffs
mickey tries to watch the offscreen bobby short he crosses his arms across his chest
the film cuts back briefly to bobby short playing the piano
singing continuing im in love again and i love love love it
then abruptly cuts to a taxi pulls away from the curb as mickey and holly walk out of the hotel through its revolving doors
holly stays under the awning mickey walks to the curb and looks angrily back at her
people pass by as mickey walks back and forth from the curb to holly growing angrier and angrier
thanks for a swell time
gesturing well if you didnt like it you didnt like it but you didnt have to talk while the guy was singing
i was so bored
gesturing yeah thats tough
you dont deserve cole porter
you should stay with those groups that look like theyre gonna stab their mother
at least im open to new concepts
and you dont have to snort cocaine at the table all the time

gesturing this crowd wouldnt know the difference
waving his arm and whistling for a taxi im glad hannah got us together

a taxi pulls up to the curb
mickey and holly walk up to its rear door
oh look im sorry it didnt work out

mickey starts to walk along the sidewalk as the taxi drives off he passes the hotel and several evening lit store windows
im in love again begins to play in the background as mickeys voice is heard
yeah it was quite an evening
holly with her cocaine
chuckling she should have been wearing a gold shovel around her neck
tch she was polymorphously insensitive i think
smacking his lips too bad too
cause you know i always had a little crush on her
both a bus and a taxi drive down the street blocking mickey from view
the music stops and the film cuts to afternoons
a big band rendition of you made me love you begins as the film cuts to a hotel room
elliot and lee can be seen dancing cheek to cheek in the reflection of a mirror over a dresser
a tv sits in the corner
a lamp is on one side of the dresser on the other side is a bucket with champagne
two half full glasses sit nearby
elliot and lee dance into view
without missing a beat elliot picks up one of the glasses of champagne and hands it to lee
elliot sips then puts it back down on the dresser

mickey starts pounding the door again as the movie cuts to a beautiful snow covered church downtown complete with courtyard and wrought iron fence
a pedestrian walks by with an umbrella
a church choir sings a soaring hymn over the scene
the music continues as the film moves inside where the choir is seen singing behind an altar glowing warm gold
a fairly large congregation sits in darkened pews as the film cuts to the back where mickey his arms crossed stands underneath some stained glass windows watching and listening to
the inspiring music
the choir continues to sing as the movie cuts to father flynn in his office
he picks up some large heavy books from a shelf near his window and he walks over to mickey whos standing near his desk already holding several tomes
father flynn puts the books on top of mickeys pile mickey flipping through the top one awkwardly carries his bundle to the door
next is seen a close up of a painting of jesus christ on the cross complete with crown of thorns and holy expression
his eyes especially designed to blink as the lights hit them open and close repeatedly
the hymn plays on loudly as the camera moves back revealing mickey standing outside a barber shop window looking at the christ playing and shuffling from side to side to
gets its eyes d effect
smaller inspirational pictures border the bigger blinking christ
a barber pole with moving stripes stands nearby passing traffic is reflected in the window
mickey turns from the window shrugging and starts to walk down the street past a fruit and vegetable store with open air displayed flowers past several briskly moving pedestrians
with the hymn still playing the screen goes black briefly
mickey opens the door the light from a hallway illuminating him
hes just entered his apartment
he closes the door and walks through his dark foyer he carries a brown bag
he switches on the light and walking past his spiral staircase past several framed pictures on the wall he makes his way to his living room coffee table
mickey pulls a crucifix out of the bag he looks at it then puts it on the table near a pile of books and some objets dart
he then takes out a copy of the new testament putting it on top of the crucifix
then out comes a framed picture of a saint
it too gets put on the growing pile
but the bag is not yet empty
next comes a large loaf of wonder bread and a large jar of hellmans mayonnaise
mickey sets them on top of the saint

elliot continues to talk over the scene
lee has no direction
shes taking courses at columbia
but just randomly
as lee stops on a portico and turns to greet doug a professor who is running over to her calling her name
they mouth hello smiling and begin to walk off together
i try not to call her but then she calls me and then
i call and
we try to resist meeting but
once in a while we meet
sometimes we argue because i cant break up my marriage
sometimes we wind up making love and
we both feel terrible
the film cuts back to elliot in his analysts office

elliot takes a last drag on his cigarette
the camera follows his hand as he crushes it out in a nearby ashtray
face offscreen for all my education accomplishments and so called wisdom
i cant fathom my own heart

some guests sip their drinks smiling as the camera moves back to the piano and the book laden wall
evan is playing the piano with exuberance
norma still standing behind him has a poignant wistful expression on her face
she mouths the words to the song evan is playing it could happen to you
the woman next to her smiles enjoying the music as the camera continues its exploration moving to a man standing in the doorway with a group of children
mavis the maid walks by with a tray of hors doeuvres
the man takes one mouthing his thanks as the camera travels past the open bookshelf past two boys in suits who are drinking soda and munching to reveal lee
she is leaning against another doorway a faraway look on her face as she listens to the music
mavis passes in the hall beyond the doorway
several people deep in conversation stand nearby as elliot holding a drink walks up behind her
sipping his drink youve been very cold to me tonight
glancing back at elliot then turning away no

turning oh not here
touching elliots arm there are too many people around
lee slips past elliot and walks away
elliot looks back at her briefly then sipping his drink he turns and looks offscreen at the crowd in the living room
holly is standing in the pantry preparing some offscreen food
near her is a restaurantlike swinging door with a glass porthole
in the foreground the kitchen table is crowded with bowls and plates of food
an open cupboard separates holly from the rest of the room
looking offscreen hey hannah
you know i think lee is really serious about her new boyfriend
yeah eh from what i understand he sounds really nice
hannah walks into view headed for the refrigerator
she carries two tomatoes
im so happy for her
i think shes in love
hannah opens the refrigerator totally ignoring holly
reacting hey whats the matter
taking a bunch of celery out and slamming the refrigerator door im real upset about what you wrote
hannah walks over to the table gathering up more food
its obviously based on elliot and me
oh so loosely
angrily no not oh so loosely
is that how you see us
shrugging walking out of the pantry area well interrupting can i can i not accept gestures and feelings from people
do i do i put people off
holly walks over to the sink and washes her hands
reacting well its a made up story
she dries her hands as hannah her arms laden with vegetables strides over to her sister
yelling no its real exact
the the situations the dialogue everything
its its full of intimate details between elliot and me
which i dont i dont see how you could even possibly know about
a conversation we once had about adoption
hannah storms out a nearby door as holly turns away from the sink
gesturing the towel still in her hand as she speaks to her offscreen sister well lee mentioned that to me so obviously you discussed it with her
pacing around the table i just took the essence and i blew it up into drama
holly wipes her hand on the towel as hannah reenters the kitchen carrying even more vegetables
i dont see how lee could know about these things
i dont tell her everything
hannah strides into the pantry area and flops the vegetables down on the counter
holly puts the dishtowel down and absently straightens some things on the food laden table
reacting wow i guess i hit a nerve
turning to look at holly you make it sound like you know i have no needs or something
you think im too self sufficient
stopping her mindless straightening at the table reacting now hannah thats not what i meant you know
walking offscreen to the sink area uh yeah everybody relies on you for so much
youre so giving
its not a criticism
we love you
walking out of the pantry to the food laden table youre grateful but you resent me
offscreen oh wow
i dont want to have this conversation
i didnt do anything wrong
hannah angrily gathers up some spices from the table holly walks back onscreen holding a silver ice bucket
she stops at the corner of the table and faces hannah
onscreen y you mentioned to me yourself that you and elliot were having some problems
gesturing yeah were having some problems but problems that are my business
which i dont see how you could know about in such detail
how does lee know about these things
hannah picks up a large bowl and carries it as well as her armload of spices into the pantry area
turning to look at her sister as she walks past well why dont you share them with us
with her back to the camera i dont
i dont want to bother everyone
facing her sisters back thats the point
id like to be bothered
turning to look at holly i dont see how you could know about these things unless elliots been talking to you
shaking her head no he hasnt
if i offended you im sorry
hannah reacting puts the spices down on the pantry counter
holly turns away
the film cuts to the dining room doorway
guests can be seen mingling and talking and helping themselves at a buffet table in the living room
lee and elliot can be heard offscreen as the camera slowly moves from the doorway across the empty dining room to reveal them in the midst of an intense conversation
the piano as well as soft chatter is heard in the background
offscreen its over elliot
i dont know how to make it any clearer
i cant see you anymore
offscreen overlapping uh

i told you i wasnt going to wait forever
lee goes over to an open door and closes it quickly
offscreen but it hasnt been forever
walking over to lee at the just closed door gesturing its been nearly a year since our first time and youre still married to my sister which
i now realize is fine because youre probably much more in love with her than you know
shaking his head yeah but we we made so many plans
overlapping gesturing yeah
uh well sure we did
an an and in a way you led me on because i truly believed you were unhappy with hannah
otherwise i would never have let myself be drawn in
i was very weak
so were you
now ive met someone else
the door opens and mavis appears holding a set of candlesticks
she walks over to the dining room table which is already decked out with a floral centerpiece glassware and china
she puts them down as lee and elliot stand awkwardly near the door waiting for her to leave
to mavis dinner soon
about fifteen minutes
nodding uh huh
both lee and elliot quickly close the door behind her and immediately pick up where theyd left off
and youre in love overnight
i care a great deal about him yes
trying to put his arm around lee lee
pulling back flinging her hands ah its over
elliot i mean it
they look at each other reacting as the film cuts back to hannahs kitchen
normas face can be seen in the porthole window on the other side of the pantrys swinging door
she looks around the kitchen then opens the door and steps inside
holly stands nearby working in the pantry area
holding the door half in and half out of the kitchen sweetheart i loved your script
i thought it was so clever
turning to norma smiling and holding a glass of wine well youre my mother
not everybodys gonna be such a sucker
gesturing i particularly liked the character of the mother
just a boozy old flirt with a filthy mouth
im so proud
oh mom thanks
norma steps back out of the kitchen the door swinging shut behind her
holly looks at the door sipping her wine as the movie cuts back to hannahs living room
a chubby friendly uncle sits on a sofa one child on his lap and several others gathered cross legged around him on the floor
they lean on the coffee table which is covered with glasses and a bowl of chips
other guests mingle in the background one couple enters the living room smiling at the scene on the sofa
mavis crosses the well lit foyer in the background and opens the door to more guests
the piano plays on
raising his bottle of beer to the children now heres a toast to thanksgiving all right
the children mutter their enthusiastic agreement picking up their illicit glasses of beer
are we supposed to have beer
the uncle pours more beer from his bottle into the kids outstretched glasses
they cry indistinctly with excitement
overlapping the childrens squeals of delight let me at it
to one of the little boys hows that fletcher
laughing he turns to the little girl sitting on his lap he clinks his bottle against the bottle she is holding which is almost as big as she is
to the little girl doll
heres a little toast doll
clinking glasses come on
the uncle and the children happily drink their beer as the movie cuts to a wall with subtly patterned wallpaper in hannahs bedroom
her face moves on to the screen
to the offscreen elliot have you been talking to holly or lee about us
about our our personal life
of course not
theres things holly wrote about in her script about us that are so
personal they could only have come from you
offscreen look ive got a splitting headache and i dont like being accused
hannah walks towards elliot hes in the bathroom standing over the sink
gesturing im not accusing
do you find me too
closing the door of the bathroom slightly so only she is seen on the screen too too too competent
too too i dont know disgustingly perfect or something
elliot walks from behind the partially closed door to an offscreen medicine cabinet
following elliot and gesturing talking to his back well what is it then
eh whats come between us
how have i alienated you
taking a bottle of aspirin from the cabinet and walking back to the sink gesturing hannah my head is throbbing
gesturing you never want to talk about it
i every time i bring it up you you change the subject
what is it
do you were communicating less and less
you sleep with me less and less
angrily turning to hannah and pointing as she shouts hannah i am very mixed up
elliot turns back to the sink once again obscured by the partially closed door
reacting her voice trembling slightly and gesturing do you talk to holly or lee behind my back
they they seem to know so much about us
walking towards a towel rack and gesturing well maybe ive asked advice once or twice or or made a joke
he dries his hands as hannah standing behind him continues to talk
gesturing well what do you do
do do do you talk to holly or lee or what
do you do you do you phone them
whirling around to face hannah snapping leave me alone can you
he closes the door briefly obscuring hannah and himself from view
continuing in a lower tone jesus ive told you
i need someone i can matter to
the camera moves behind the closed door into the bathroom
reacting near tears you matter to me
pausing his voice rising again its hard to be around someone who gives so much and and needs so little in return
he opens the medicine cabinet and puts the aspirin bottle back
gesturing pleading but look
i i have enormous needs
elliot slams the medicine cabinet shut
shouting well i cant see them and neither can lee or holly
hannah watches him go reacting
she is stunned
the dark hallway is illuminated by light coming from the offscreen foyer pictures line the wall
piano music is still heard very softly in the background as hannah hugging herself walks slowly down the hallway into the living room
she briefly looks around lost in thought
she sits down heavily tiredly on the arm of the couch as the movie cuts to several framed photographs on the mantel
one shows hannah and elliot on their wedding day
another shows elliot obscured in the shadows
yet another has captured norma as a young girl
the camera however moves closer and closer to a photograph showing hannah lee and holly the three sisters smiling into the camera
there is no sound
the film shows the bedroom night table holding a small lamp a wooden box a cast iron fire truck an ashtray and glasses
elliots pajama clad arm moves into view
he turns off the lamp the room is now pitch black
offscreen its so pitch black tonight
i feel lost
offscreen youre not lost
elliot turns the lamp back on then turns to hannah she is lying on her side of the bed partially in shadow
he leans over and kisses her
i love you so much
they begin to kiss passionately as bewitched starts to play in the background
lucky i ran into you
bewitched continues as the film cuts to a busy nighttime new york city street
mickey his hands in his pockets walks along the sidewalk one person among many other pedestrians
he pulls his coat tighter around him as he walks
bewitched continues to play as he passes tower records neon lit window
he glances inside
and sees holly her jacket flung over her shoulders looking at some records
mickey walks through the revolving doors of tower records up a few stairs to the selling floor proper and stops right in front of holly
gesturing mmm i dont know if you remember me but we had the worst night of my life together
laughing holding some records i remember you
overlapping yes you do recall right
overlapping smiling and nodding i recall you

touching his nose again overlapping laughing id never do that

smiling glancing away for a moment oh well that was a long time ago
overlapping you look wonderful

there is a brief pause and the movie cuts to the screen shows a chaise in mickeys apartment an ashtray on a stand sits nearby
the camera moves down the chaise past several piles of books to mickeys coffee table
he sits picking at his fingers and listening on the edge of the table in front of holly who is sitting cross legged on the floor propped up with a
pillow reading her script aloud
offscreen as the camera moves across the room towards her and mickey reading we all go through life playing the hand were dealt

pausing grinning god you really liked it
you made me love you starts to play as the movie cuts to the street outside mickeys apartment house an old building complete with a red entrance door and a
gray weather beaten facade
trees line the sidewalk
holly and mickey emerge from the door and walk up the street revealing a whole row of similar apartment buildings
they pass a few other people as they walk
the film then moves to the outside of a charming glass and stainedwood cafe
through the window holly and mickey can be seen having lunch
holly is talking animatedly mickey takes a sip of coffee
some people pass by
next the film cuts to an almost isolated path in central park complete with old fashioned streetlamps and scattered leaves
holly and mickey stroll into view deep in conversation
gesturing gosh you really went through a crisis you know that
h how did you get over it
i mean when i ran into you you seemed you seemed just perfectly fine
well you seem fine now
chuckling ill tell you
sighing one day about a month ago
the film abruptly cuts to mickeys flashback a visual counterpoint to the story he is telling holly
a close up of a nervous perspiring and panting mickey alone in his apartment appears on the screen as his voice is heard
i really hit bottom
you know i just felt that in a godless universe i didnt want to go on living
now i happen to own this rifle
coughing mickey raises the barrel of a rifle to his forehead
he shuts his eyes tightly
which i loaded believe it or not and pressed it to my forehead
and i remember thinking at the time im gonna kill myself
then i thought
what if im wrong
what if there is a god
i mean after all nobody really knows that
the camera moves past the desperate mickey to a mirror on the wall behind him
its reflection shows his spiral staircase and some standing lamps
a clock faintly ticks
but then i thought no
you know maybe is not good enough
i want certainty or nothing
and i remember very clearly the clock was ticking and i was sitting there frozen with the gun to my head debating whether to shoot
the gun goes off with a loud bang
the mirror shatters
all of a sudden the gun went off
mickey holding the rifle is seen running over to the shattered mirror
the sounds of his excited neighbors their shouting a knocking door are heard as he continues his tale
i had been so tense my finger had squeezed the trigger inadvertently
offscreen overlapping whats happening
wh wh whats going on
continuing but i was perspiring so much the gun had slid off my forehead and missed me
offscreen overlapping i dont know
i heard a gun
is everything all right
mickey still brandishing the rifle runs into his sunlit living room
he looks around frantically his shirt loose
finally he throws the rifle down between the sofa and the coffee table
the gun goes off a second time
mickey standing nearby jumps his hands flying to his head
the doorbell rings the neighbors begin pounding at the door
and suddenly neighbors were were pounding on the door and and i dont know the whole scene was just pandemonium
and uh you know and i i i i i ran to the door
mickey runs offscreen briefly to answer the door
i i i i didnt know what to say
you know i was i was embarrassed and confused and my my my mind was r r racing a mile a minute
he returns onscreen panting he looks frantically once again around the living room
and i i jus knew one thing
the film cuts to a west side street
its an overcast day
mickey walking slowly along the sidewalk passes several other pedestrians and numerous storefronts including kleins pharmacy and a bar b q take out
occasionally he is obscured by a tree trunk on the opposite side of the street a few taxis go by as he talks over the scene
i i i i had to get out of that house
i had to just get out in the fresh air and and clear my head
and i remember very clearly
i walked the streets
i walked and i walked
i i didnt know what was going through my mind
it all seemed so violent and un unreal to me
and i wandered
the movie cuts to the exterior of the metro movie theater with its smoked glass entrance doors and its art deco feel
an old publicity photo hangs inside
mickeys reflection is seen at the almost transparent doors as well as the reflection of the street and various cars whizzing by
his reflection walks towards the theater entrance he continues his story
for a long time on the upper west side you know an and it must have been hours
you know my my feet hurt
my head was was pounding and and i had to sit down
i went into a movie house
i i didnt know what was playing or anything
mickey walks into the movie house
he is seen through the glass doors which still reflect the street and traffic outside
he makes his way through the lobby into the actual theater
i just i just needed a moment to gather my thoughts and and be logical and and put the world back into rational perspective
the film abruptly cuts to the theaters black and white screen where the marx brothers in duck soup play the helmets of several soldiers standing in a line like a
the sounds of the xylophone are heard as the movie cuts to the darkened theater where mickey slowly sits down in a balcony seat
the xylophone music stops and changes to hidee hidee hidee hidee hidee hidee ho as sung by the marx brothers and ensemble in the movie
the singing continues faintly in the background as mickey continues his tale and i went upstairs to the balcony and i sat down sighing and you know the movie was
a a a film that id seen many times in my life since i was a kid an and i always u uh loved it
and you know im im watching these people up on the screen and i started getting hooked o on the film you know
the film cuts back to the black and white movie screen as mickey continues to talk
the marx brothers as well as the hundred odd other cast members in duck soup are kneeling and bowing as they sing hidee hidee ho
they kick their heels up in the air
they sway back and forth hands clasped singing oh h h h h h
and i started to feel how can you even think of killing yourself
i mean isnt it so stupid
i mean l look at all the people up there on the screen
you know theyre real funny and and what if the worst is true
the movie cuts back to mickey sitting almost obscured in the dark theater
the oh h h h h hs coming from the offscreen movie are heard as he continues to speak
what if theres no god and you only go around once and thats it
well you know dont you want to be part of the experience
you know what the hell it i its not all a drag
and im thinking to myself geez i should stop ruining my life
as mickey talks the film cuts back to the antics of the marx brothers on the black and white theater screen
the four brothers are now swaying and singing and strutting their voices indistinct over mickeys narration
searching for answers im never gonna get and just enjoy it while it lasts
the film is back on mickeys dark form in the audience
after who knows
i mean you know maybe there is something
nobody really knows
i know i know maybe is a very slim reed to hang your whole life on but thats the best we have
then i started to sit back and i actually began to enjoy myself
as mickey continues the film cuts back to duck soup on the black and white screen
the marx brothers are sitting on a judges bench playing banjos and singing with the other cast members
they jump down from the bench still singing
their voices swell
oh freedonia oh dont you cry for me theyll be coming around the mountain
the marx brothers kneel strumming their banjos and the movie cuts back to central park
the flashback is over
mickey and holly continue their stroll as you made me love you begins to play in the background
they pass some people a cluster of buildings that look like castles and the manhattan skyline as seen through the trees as the camera moves back farther and farther away
from them showing a beautiful central park frozen in time
look theres something ive uh thats been bothering me for a long time and i just thought id just tell you what it was and just sort of clear the
deck here and chuckling thats this

a large perfectly roasted turkey on a serving plate briefly fills the screen as the camera moves across the food laden table in hannahs kitchen past an electric mixer several
bowls spices tomatoes and parsley to reveal evan walking through the doorway
holding a drink i want ice
whos got some pointing to an ice bucket on the table oh there it is
offscreen overlapping its on the table dad

lee walks off drying her wet hands in the air
hannah in a silk dress moves onscreen going to the table and pouring herself a glass of wine as norma enters the kitchen

norma unscrews the liquor bottle and pours some into her empty glass as hannah stops her mashing reacting
gasping and laughing oh mom
overlapping reacting oh honey
the movie leaves the kitchen and cuts to the doorway between the dining room and the living room
upbeat jazz plays over the low din of the party
two women stand by the partially set dining room table chatting and arranging some plates as elliot strolls into view sipping a drink
he passes the women and walks through the doorway into the living room nodding hello to a guest who is walking the other way
he enters the living room smiling
it is crowded with guests hannahs children play in their midst
one of hannahs boys grabs elliots arm
they playfully spar for a moment before elliot laughingly shakes him off continuing on his way into a connecting room
he stops at the doorway looking at the crowd
the camera shows his point of view guests stand in clusters enjoying themselves one woman chats with a little boy another woman carrying a drink walks over to a group
of other guests
the film then cuts back briefly to elliot holding his drink and looking straight ahead as it shows his point of view once more
this time he sees a smiling lee and doug talking animatedly a few guests are seen in the background
elliots voice is heard over a close up of the couple
oh lee you are something
lee and doug kiss each other
they continue talking
you look very beautiful
marriage agrees with you
everything that happened between us pausing seems more and more hazy
as lee takes a sip of her drink the movie cuts back to elliot standing in the doorway and still staring straight ahead
the camera moves in closer to his face as he talks over the scene
i acted like such a fool
i dont know what came over me
that complete conviction that i couldnt live without you
the film quickly cuts to a brief look at lee and doug still talking animatedly and smiling
lee gently pushes back dougs hair
what did i put us both through
the camera moves back to elliot
continuing who as you once said i love much more than i realized
after pausing for a moment on elliots face the film cuts to the foyer where two boys and a girl gather by the door
one boy opens it revealing holly
she joyfully enters the apartment greeting each child with an enthusiastic kiss
kissing the children hi
how are you
kissing happy thanksgiving
i didnt miss dinner did i
overlapping talking at once no
the jazz ends as the record scratches and stops
evans rendition of isnt it romantic is heard on the piano as holly shrugging the strap of her pocketbook off her shoulder walks towards the living room
she is stopped by three guests two women one of them wearing glasses and a man who are coming out of the room
overlapping you look lovely
overlapping hugging holly hello darling
overlapping good to see you

hugging the man hello
the movie cuts to hannah leaning contentedly against a doorway into the living room and listening to the offscreen evan play the piano
elliot holding his drink walks over to her
they look at each other for a beat elliot then hugs hannah pulling her towards him
she leans her head on his shoulder fingering his jacket lapel
they look offscreen together happily intimately at the offscreen guests as the camera moves across the room past a few guests to reveal evan sitting at the piano
norma sits at his side one arm resting on the piano
she holds a drink and looks off in the distance mouthing the words to isnt it romantic
the camera then moves to the doorway in the living room where a man holding a drink enters and joins the happy crowd
evan can be seen in the background playing his song
a child plays near the coffee table
the camera continues to move past the doorway past a huge grandfather clock to a second doorway leading to the den
here more guests are gathered a child sits in a small chair by the sofa
he sips a soda as female guest enters the room and crouches down next to him smiling
she waves to him
he waves back as the camera continues to move past the doorway to reveal holly standing in front of a hallway mirror fixing her earrings
mavis can be seen in the background through the doorway into the dining room lighting the candles on the table
she dims the lights darkening the room and the hallway where holly stands in a warm candlelit glow
mavis leaves the dining room and passes holly
still fixing her earrings to mavis its beautiful
mavis walks off
holly reflected in the mirror begins fluffing her hair as mickey enters and wraps his arms around her from behind
the camera stays focused on the mirror both holly and mickey are now seen in its reflection
