written by brad copeland angle on billy matthews ravenously eating a plate of hashbrowns runny fried eggs and syrupy waffles
we see doug matthews s sitting across the table staring at his son billy
doug is handsome in that honest sincere way
a guy you would call to help you move a couch
he watches billy scoop up his hashbrowns with a frosted pop tart
billy catches his dads look and grins with his mouth full
doug smiles back then looks down at his own plate
he has scrambled egg whites and sliced tomatoes
his smile fades away
doug snaps out of it and looks up at his wife kelly matthews
shes attractive with a patient smile
ive got some stuff to do for the party tomorrow
can you take billy to school
this party isnt going to be fancy is it
just some friends and a wing platter from costco
its a our th anniversary doug

wild hogs writers first draft

doug looks a little insulted
doug can you take billy or not

one beep from that thing and bam
like a cheetah
billy now pouring lucky charms into a bowl looks up
the battery ith gone in that thing

doug gives billy a look
i did do that
i forgot about that
i need to get some batteries in there
because dentists do have emergencies
we are doctors you know
we take the same oath
the oath of saving lives
doug goes to take some of billys discarded lucky charms
billy swats his hand away
doug nods defeated as billy hops up and dumps the remaining lucky charms in the trash

doug drives a volvo station wagon along the streets of cincinnati
billy is next to him in the passenger seat looking bored
you know i use to race a car like this
put a hemi under the hood
nobody saw me coming
it could really
smoke some ass
billy raises his eyebrows impressed
this was a good time to break the no saying ass rule
they called it the dragon wagon
youre lucky to be in here without a helmet pal
we both are
doug downshifts a gear and the tame engine roars artificially
billy is impressed
hey can i jam the radio
heck yeah you can jam the radio
doug tussles billys hair and smiles
the volvo pulls up to a red light
radio disney blares mickey loves mambo from the stereo
billy bobs his head along with the music
doug looks out the window and sees a mid twenties guy in a porsche staring at him
doug nods hello then awkwardly faces forward

bob levenstein s is working at his computer
bob is good enough looking but with a gawky wimpishness and burdened eyes
he tries to ignore the speakerphone
bob cringes at the shrill female voice
you need to come tell haley she cant go to a party tonight
into speaker phone well im technically at the office right now so
the door behind him flings open and karen levenstein attractive and harsh looking steps in holding a phone
are you kidding me
you work in our guest bedroom not an office
i know i was just trying to make this yeah and i have to go to a job that actually makes us money bob
so get out here and tell haley shes not going anywhere
bob nods obediently and hurries out of the room
bob enters the kitchen
his five year old daughter claire wearing a dance leotard walks up to him and smiles
wild hogs writers first draft
screams at the top of her bob winces and looks around for his other daughter
bob reaches for it but his other teenage daughter haley runs in wearing a denim mini skirt and ugg boots
dont touch that
haley snatches the phone away from bob
actually i need to talk to you hey julien
ill probably just drop by and chill
if thats about the party you dad
im talking here
haley storms out of the room
bob goes to say something but claire enters and looks up at him
bob just stares at her as karen enters the kitchen
yelling above claire did you talk to her
tell me you talked to her
i have to do everything
just get claire to ballet
well i really have to finish my your little article for the web magazine bob
wild hogs writers first draft
i have a shareholder meeting
and we agreed that my career would be the priority and you would work out of the house
you might not like it but my job is higher paying
and i dont see you complaining about that hundred dollar shirt youre wearing
bob looks down at his too hip dress shirt
you bought this shirt for me
i was fine with my t shirts oh you dont like the shirt now

bob sighs and takes the shirt off
karen snatches it from him
now take claire to her ballet class
its starts in five minutes
well i have to get another go
karen pushes bob out the door with claire skipping happily behind him
bob sits in the car shirtless next to claire
he looks over at her and notices a pink hoodie in her lap

for five dollars im not
bob sighs and reaches for his wallet
wild hogs writers first draft
a bunch of kids in dance leotards are starting a class
claire comes running into the group as bob enters behind her wearing the pink hoodie
its way too small and doesnt quite cover his belly
he sits with the parents and nods awkwardly to them
we see the pristine living room of an expensive architectural house
we see woody stevens s handsome but with shifty eyes and a michael keaton hairline walk through the stylish house speaking into a cordless headset
no you listen to me
youre not going to push me around
we agreed on a price and thats the price ill pay
if you dont like it walk away
but you can kiss your business good bye because thats what happens when you screw with woody stevens
you go down
as woody talks he passes by framed magazine covers of a beautiful model claudia as well as some pictures of his wedding day with her their exotic vacations and one
blownup glamour shot of woody shirtless oiled and holding a greasy wrench
no moneys not the problem laughs moneys never a problem
you just need to honor the correct price
woody gets his answer and angrily throws the headset down on a stack of moving boxes
he marches to the front door and throws it open
wild hogs writers first draft
woody yells out the front door
then go home toby
you make me sick
angle on the front yard
a ten year old boy is standing with a rake surrounded by leaves
he clicks off his cellphone and shrugs
i cant do this many leaves for ten bucks
itll take two hours
well you should have thought of that before you put the any yard for ten bucks flyer on the telephone pole
youre done on this block now
and that goes for your band fund raisers too
im not buying any candy bars no matter what parade you dorks have to get to
woody slams the door closed
toby kicks at a pile of leaves then starts home
we see an office crowded with disassembled apple computers motherboards and abandoned monitors
angle on dudley frank late s an odd looking curly haired guy with black plastic glasses that are slightly too big for his face
he stares at a computer in front of him
yeah hey mac
hows it go it is now nine oclock am
wild hogs writers first draft
open internet okay
it is now nine oclock am
ill show you
dudley clicks a few keys and nods satisfactorily
dudley laughs good naturedly
right because i just opened it
i guess i need to research alternative specs
searching alternative sex
dudley jumps forward and starts hitting the keys
two million websites found
i didnt want to search that
i said specs
all the data to be compiled
searching sex all the day with child
wild hogs writers first draft
dudley frantically starts ripping the power wires out of the computer
the monitor goes dark
dudley touches it sadly then looks over at a cat sitting on the edge of the desk
looks like its still just you and me icat
dudley reaches out to pet the cat
it hisses at him angrily and he quickly pulls his hand back
doug now in his lab coat sits at his desk playing with a model of a mouth
the phone rings and doug answers it
intercut with kelly on the phone at home
ive got a mouth right here in front of me
doug takes a dental tool and hammers on the plastic mouth
dont they mind you being on the phone
well its not attached to a head really
doug hits the mouth too hard and all the teeth fall out
he fumbles to stop them from scattering everywhere
wild hogs writers first draft
well i just wanted to tell you i found a great rate for the ritz carlton tomorrow night
i thought it might be romantic
mom can stay here with billy
i dont know
do you think we really need to stay at a hotel
i mean billy has his own room
why dont we just buy new sheets
like hotel colored ones
itll be like the ritz but we wont have to pay to make phone calls
im just saying suddenly the speaker comes on overhead
patient emergency in room eight
doug snaps to attention
ive got to go
doug jumps out of his seat and scrambles over his desk and out the door
doug flies into an exam room where a hygienist dana is looking into a male patients mouth
take a look at this
doug looks in the mans mouth and nods
acute molar abscess
thats going to need emergency surgery
wild hogs writers first draft
thats what i thought
thank god you got here
well lets send him over to an orthopedic surgeon
he looks around for something else to do but theres nothing
he moves a dental tool away from the edge of a tray smiles politely and exits
doug looking depressed pulls into the driveway
he looks over and sees billy and three of his friends shooting baskets
he smiles gets out of the car and struts over
matthews is open
billy looks up and cringes a little bit but passes the ball to doug
doug dribbles it under his leg and charges the basket
taking it into the paint
whos got the d
whoop too late dudes
doug jumps up to slam the ball but only hammers it into the rim
the rim clangs loudly and the ball goes flying backwards
billys friends laugh a little
well thats not really my shot
i usually hit from downtown you know
doug grabs the ball out of the bushes and dribbles back to the three point line
wild hogs writers first draft
thats where the big games get won
back here from the three doug swivels jumps up and releases the ball
it heads towards the basket then falls down five feet before it
it looks more like a pass than a shot
billy hangs his head humiliated
that was a pass dudes
doug nods with false confidence to the kids stands there awkwardly for a moment then quietly heads inside
doug enters and finds kelly
she smiles and kisses him
kelly hands doug a sandwich bag of celery
he looks over to the table where kelly has laid out ritz crackers covered in cheez whiz for the kids
doug puts the bag of celery down
i think im just going to go meet the guys for a beer
lite beer if you want to stick to that diet
just delicious beer
doug smiles and heads upstairs
kelly looks concerned
doug enters his bedroom and shuts the door behind him
he sits down on the bed and lets out a long sigh
wild hogs writers first draft
after a moment he gets up and walks over to the closet
he opens it and we see a leather biker jacket leather chaps boots gloves a black half helmet etc
for the first time we see a genuine smile come over dougs face
the garage door on dougs house rolls open like a theater curtain and doug wearing the full leather biker getup idles out of the garage on a gleaming chromed out
harley davidson fatboy
he looks around the neighborhood cockily smiles then kicks the bike into gear and rides into the street
the camera rotates around him and comes to rest on the back of his jacket where we see a large patch that reads wild hogs
the camera zooms in on this and it becomes bob creeps through the living room
from the kitchen we can hear karen haley and claire screaming things at him about him etc
he just tip toes to the hall closet and opens the door
we dont see whats in it but see bob smile the same way doug did and
bob in leather biker gear rolls out of his garage on another shimmering harley davidson
he looks around through his mirrored aviator sunglasses like a complete bad ass
he looks down the street and spots doug riding towards him
bob rides down the driveway and joins alongside doug
they nod silently to each other and tap fists like the toughest guys in the world
we see bob is also wearing a wild hogs jacket
woody walks through the courtyard and into a pristine garage
wild hogs writers first draft
he passes by a bmw several stacks of labelled moving boxes and finally a beautiful harley davidson softail anniversary edition
a minute later woody pulls onto the street on his harley
doug and bob turn the corner and nod to him
woody nods back revs his engine and joins alongside them
we see a garage crowded with disassembled apple computers printers and a harley davidson sportster
out walks dudley whos biker outfit doesnt quite mesh with his thick lensed eyeglasses
dudley cockily pulls on a wild hogs jacket kick starts the motorcycle presses a button to open the garage door and rides the motorcycle out
however as he gets halfway out of the garage the garage door catches on something and snaps back down
it clotheslines dudley off the bike which rolls down the driveway and into some garbage cans
dudley lays in the driveway staring up at the sky with a pained look on his face
doug bob and woody ride towards dudleys house but find dudley sitting in his driveway with his arms around his knees
he shrugs and motions to his motorcycle which he has stood back up but has a bent wheel and smashed headlight
doug and bob take in the situation and then look at woody
woody rolls his eyes
doug bob and woody ride along
we see dudley is riding bitch on woodys bike and woody doesnt seem thrilled about it
the camera pans around and we see they are all wearing wild hogs jackets
and on this we the guys pull up at a biker theme bar with a motorcycle mounted above the entrance
wild hogs writers first draft
woody is obviously humiliated to have dudley behind him as they park the bikes among a crowd of other bikers
dudley climbs off the back of woodys bike and pats him on the shoulder
i feel really safe with you
i noticed that
and if you ever lay your head on my back when youre riding bitch again im going to throw you into traffic
i was trying to keep my face out of the wind
i felt you smell my hair
lets go get a brew
doug heads into the bar
youre cool with the carbs
doug pauses without turning around
i can have a light
doug continues into the bar but now with less swagger
the guys are sitting at a worn table
the place is crowded with curiously gentle looking bikers
woody looks around the bar with a smirk
man i wish we could find a place that wasnt so freaking lame
what are you talking about
this place is cool
were with other bikers
wild hogs writers first draft
suddenly a large bald biker comes up and slams a beer down on their table
wild hogs arent welcome here
the guys all look at him for a beat then the bald guy cracks a smile
paul laughs at his joke
woody your tax return is almost done but i want to talk to you next week about incorporating
a lot of my executive clients have been yeah paul
ill talk to you about it on the trip
yeah well talk about in daytona
angrily to group what the hell are you staring at
paul glares at the other guys for a beat then cracks up
see you guys
woody shakes his head
this place sucks
why are we going to daytona with these posers
because its bike week
thats our annual trip woody

thats a patch your wife made and we all had to sew it on our jackets so she didnt feel bad
wild hogs writers first draft
she took an embroidery class for those
what has your wife ever made us
dont tell her
its not a big secret bob
shes a swimsuit model
i mean so is my kelly
shes very hot
even after ten years
not that im not still good looking
doug looks at the guys
they dont respond
were not going to say youre hot man
because its gay or because im not
theres no non gay response to that
if i were a girl id be attracted to you
well kelly must still think youre hot
ten years man
hows that feel
i dont know
good i guess

no thats the th
ten is aluminum
wild hogs writers first draft
considers then yeah that feels about right
aluminum is sturdy lightweight
woody smiles and puts a map down on the table
and ready for the trip of a lifetime
the guys look at the map puzzled
we dont need a map for daytona
we just follow the group
woody takes a drink from his beer then looks at the group with a mischievous fire behind his eyes
not if we dont go on the daytona trip
guys listen to me
its time for a change
lets go on our own trip this year
just us like it was in college
forget these guys
forget daytona beach
bike week is just corporate white guys playing dress up
this bar is too
and we didnt get into this to play dress up we got in this to live
be cool and ride free
thats the wild hog creed
no its not
its the slogan for the downtown trolley
but it works as our creed too
so lets live it
but i boogie board in daytona
cant our creed be be cool and boogie board
wild hogs writers first draft
thats dumb dudley
let the big people talk
well what kind of trip are you suggesting
another bike week somewhere
thats the best part
we dont do some planned out trip
we follow the open road
the backbone of america
we take a week and go all the way to san francisco
think about it guys
camping out stopping wherever we want whenever we want
when was the last time we had that
the guys consider this but look sceptical
i dont know man
youre afraid to ask your wife
what do you think
well daytona isnt the backbone of america but it is a tradition
weve been riding with this club for years
do we really want to miss out on that
one of the bikers kent approaches carrying a box
check these out
kent holds up a sleeveless t shirt with a big cartoon guy on a motorcycle with the words born to be wild
were all going to wear these on the trip
wild hogs writers first draft
that way everyone will know were from the cincinnati chapter
itll also get you ten percent off at t
born to be wild
dudley grabs a shirt and starts to pull it over the t shirt he already has on
woody gives a look to bob and doug
look well talk about it tomorrow
but we dont need some trip to go live
we are living
free and wild
the anniversary party is in full swing
doug is watching several guests dish steaming pasta and cream sauce out of a chaffing dish
he looks down at his plate of field greens and skinless chicken breast
free and wild
doug looks around the party
several middle aged couples are dancing on the living room floor
others mingle laughing
everyone is having a great time except doug who stands there listless
kelly walks up and kisses him on the cheek
its getting pretty late though
maybe we should kill the music
drop a hint
its eight oclock
it started at seven
still thats late
we should just flicker the lights on and off
people will get it
wild hogs writers first draft
people are having fun
look at the miltons
angle on the living room
a happy looking couple the miltons are dancing around to princes
there should be laws against that
is fred having a seizure
no freds having a good time
with his wife
remember what that was like
hey we have fun all the time
but im not going to let myself look like that
he wears dress socks with shorts too
ive seen it
do you want me to do that
i dont care
why do you
doug searches for a response as roger kellys dad clinks his wine glass at the front of the room
excuse me everybody
i have a little toast
for my daughter and her husband
roger winks at doug and kelly
doug smiles weakly
sotto to kelly hes drunk
we should do something
i want to start by saying how proud i am of my son in law
sotto to kelly no hes fine
let him talk
now i have to make an admission
ten years ago when doug and kelly got married
i was worried
doug was a little wild
the guests laugh
doug gives an unsure chuckle
wild hogs writers first draft
i mean he had that old trans am with the huge engine
remember how hed peel out of anywhere
even the grocery parking lot after buying baby formula
the guests laugh again
now doug isnt
or the way hed just grab kelly and run off to some crazy island to snorkel with something that thinks youre lunch
the guests continue to laugh
kelly looks at doug now
she sees this is landing on him
hes getting upset
but not anymore
hes now become the son in law i would have always hoped for
responsible reliable and a great husband to my daughter
so cheers to no no
no cheers because that wasnt an accurate toast
im still the same shitty son in law i used to be
the guests laugh
they think hes joking
come on doug
you should be proud
youve grown up
the guests nod and clink their glasses
doug shakes his head
no i havent
im still young
doug stop it
youre being rude
well tell them im the same as i used to be kelly
tell your dad not to like me
youre not the same doug
the old doug wouldnt have made fun of fred milton for dancing because he would have been out there dancing himself
wild hogs writers first draft
so what are you saying
im saying you have changed
and frankly i dont like it
i like you the way you were
i liked it when you werent afraid of looking stupid
i liked it when we laughed
i liked it when we danced
hey ill dance
its just this music is lame
people like me need a fresh beat
doug walks over to the stereo and changes the station
cand sho h y cent starts playing
doug nods along with the beat as the guests all now stare at him
yelling over music awwww yeah
this is the shit
it aint anymore man
i take you to the
andy shop doug tries to confidently sing along but struggles awkwardly as hes obviously never heard the song before
urging to doug honey stop it
youre being an ass
i thought this was what you wanted
doug starts grinding and shimmying to the beat
kelly grits her teeth
come on baby
just because were married ten years doesnt mea n were old people
it fee ls goooood
doug makes another spastic dance move then suddenly grimaces and grabs his chest
nope that feels bad doug
are you okay
wild hogs writers first draft
im just ow thats yeah i should go to the hospital doug staggers across the carpet as people run to help him
doug is in a bed with kelly next to him
a doctor enters with a chart
then i can say this a lot easier
you had a hypertensive myocardial seizure
doug nods confidently then after a moment im a dentist actually
i have no idea what you just said
it looks like you had a stress induced panic attack
im not stressed
well its probably been pretty buried
i actually see it a lot with middle aged men
work family it can take a toll on you
im not middle aged
wild hogs writers first draft
yeah i see that a lot too
we should have you out of here soon
the doctor smiles and exits the room
kelly looks at doug
i am middle aged arent i
doug takes this in
doug let me ask you a question
when was the last time you sang a bon jovi song
you used to sing bon jovi songs at the top of your lungs
like you didnt care who heard you or how dopey it sounded
then one day you just stopped
thats how its been with everything
romance sense of humor the way you used to give me that cocky little wink when you took off your shirt
its all faded away leaving just a shell of what you used to be
why no more bon jovi songs
i dont know
theres just a lot weighing me down these days you know
you have a great career a perfect family
money is fine
the only thing that could be weighing you down is me
is it me
are you tired of me
of course not
i could never be doug stops himself as it dawns on him
you can see the horror of realization creep across his face
he looks at kelly wide eyed
wild hogs writers first draft
im weighing me down
im not a guy id hang out with anymore im
whats cool about me
i dont even eat carbs
then eat them
id rather have you sing than have a thirty four waist
i still have a thirty no you dont doug
i buy your pants
weve been married ten years
and personally id like to be married fifty more but if you stay like this
i dont know
we are going to be married fifty more years kelly
im going to find old doug
i just have to figure out where to look
kelly takes a breath and pulls out a map
she hands it to doug who looks at it
i took it away from him at the party
he wouldnt stop waving it at bob and dudley
i thought you agreed it was a bad idea
it might be
but im desperate doug
i want us to be happy again
so go on it
its my anniversary present to you
considers then i only got you an ankle bracelet
wild hogs writers first draft
all i want is old doug back
this marriage cant survive without him
doug takes this in and smiles at her
shes a good wife and he knows it
suddenly bob enters the room
are you okay
yeah im okay
oh shes waiting in the parking sfx a loud honk from the parking lot
bob looks out the window nervously
kelly looks at doug
you all need this trip
doug gives her a knowing nod then turns to bob
lets forget about daytona bike week
lets ride across u
are you sure
i mean well be leaving behind everything were used to
sfx the horn honks again from outside
yelling from parking lot bob
you said two minutes
im not circling
doug shares a look with kelly then to bob wild hogs writers first draft
i think that might be okay
doug is riding his harley which is loaded with gear sleeping bag spare gas tank saddle bags
he approaches a freeway entrance ramp where woody and dudley and bob are waiting on their bikes next to an entrance ramp sign that reads u
the guys all tap fists then notice dudley is grinning ear to ear
whats wrong with you
i got a tat
you got a tattoo
im a biker dude
i got a tat
dudley yanks his jacket down to his elbows and we see he is wearing a sleeveless shirt underneath
on his bicep is a tattoo of the macintosh apple
the guys nod trying to look impressed
trademarked i know
but what are they going to do
its in my skin bitch
dudley laughs and pulls on his jacket as woody ties a bandana skull cap on his head
the guys look at woody
youre not wearing a helmet
i dont want anything between me and the road man
you will if your head falls on it
wild hogs writers first draft
woody shrugs and starts his bike
look the only rule on this trip is to have no plan
were riding to san francisco and nothing else is planned
just riding free
well if were going to make it in five days well should probably get to illinois by tonight
yeah the way i mapped it out we should be a hundred miles past st
louis by sundown
its the open road
who knows where well be
i have this little gps system
doug shows them a handheld gps system
woody grabs it and throws it into a storm drain
what the hell man
that was expensive
i did it for the good of the trip doug
you dont need gps to discover america
we just need the wind our bikes and freedom
and if we have an emergency i always have a cell phone woody takes out a cellphone
doug grabs it and throws it in the storm drain
hows that feel
woody gives doug a long look then slowly smiles
it felt good
it felt damn good
no cell phones
wild hogs writers first draft
hes right doug
bob takes his cellphone and throws it in the storm drain
you just did that so karen wouldnt call
bob starts his bike
so were not even going to talk about this
i mean shouldnt we at least yeeeeaaah
dudley throws his cellphone but instead of going into the storm drain it goes flying into traffic and smashes against an oncoming pickup truck
we hear the truck screech to a stop after it passes them
okay lets ride
the guys all hastily start their bikes and take off up the freeway ramp
we hear the truck driver screaming profanities as they guiltily ride away
music cue blue oyster cults dont fear the reaper
the four guys ride along the highway through the hills of indiana smiling and nodding to each other
its the easy rider moment
the camera rotates around and pulls overhead
its beautiful country and the guys are in heaven
dudley wears a clunky helmet from the eighties as well as world war ii motorcycle goggles
wild hogs writers first draft
a family in a station wagon pulls up to next to them
two kids press their faces against the windows looking at the bikers in awe
bob looks over at the kids in his mirrored sunglasses and gives them a badass nod
the kids are amazed
bob looks to doug
they love this
bob gives a signal to the other guys and guns his engine
the others nod gun their engines and speed away from the station wagon
the kids watch with their mouths open
the guys are cruising along as before but now we see the sky has gotten very cloudy and overcast
the guys look up at the sky apprehensively
its now pouring rain
the guys ride along in misery getting soaked
after a moment the station wagon from before pulls back up to them
the kids are still pressed against the window staring at the drenched bikers
bob looks over and tries to give them another cocky nod but now its just embarrassing
the sun has gone down and the guys have found a deserted area off the highway to set up camp
doug woody and bob lounge by a fire with a tent set up behind them
doug is roasting marshmallows and bob is straining to blow up an air mattress
why didnt you just bring a sleeping bag like us
this is more comfortable
blows a breath into it i wish karen would have let me buy the foot pump though
wild hogs writers first draft
bob continues to inflate the mattress as dudley approaches with a knotted plastic grocery bag
this is poop
dont eat it
dudley sets the bag aside and has a seat by the fire
youre supposed to bury that
go bury it
its in a plastic bag
i cant put that in the earth
ill find a trash bin tomorrow
the guys shake their heads and look back into the fire
after a moment doug smiles
this is really nice you know
chilling by the fire with your best friends
just relaxing and enjoying im sorry
dudley you have to get rid of that bag or im going to vomit in your lap
each others company
dudley grabs the bag and heads off
ill just hang it on a tree
yells after him dont hang it on a tree
these are the times well remember
after a minute doug turns to woody and bob
wild hogs writers first draft
hey when was the last time you guys heard me sing bon jovi
thank god that stopped
its been awhile
youre not as obnoxious as you used to be
you used to eat a lot more buffalo wings too
yeah i know
turns out theres carbs in the batter
hey you know what
maybe carbs are what i need to get old doug back
youve lost your dad
i think ive lost me
its this thing kelly said
you know what it is
i think im tame
im like a lion that used to be wild but now im in some disney park where tourists come by and take pictures of me like im a lion but
after they leave i go into my kennel and eat antelope nuggets or something
ones without carbs
i know what youre talking about
i lost old bob too
i think my wife and daughters killed him
im surrounded by women every minute of my life
and its made me you know
i was going to say miserable
you think im a wimp
i just thought that was what you were
i thought you wanted us to guess and i didnt have a guess so i said wimp
knowing it was wrong
wild hogs writers first draft
youre a wimp bob
ill say it
youre afraid of girls
dudley comes up and sits back down
im afraid of girls
youre afraid to talk to one
bob is afraid theyll kill him in his sleep
now i really dont want to talk to one
you know its not always so bad
like when karen sleeps she still crawls over and pushes up against me
just snuggles right up like she needs me
i like that
i like that a lot
then sobering then the sun comes up and turns her into a raging she demon
yeah i guess life just isnt as simple as it was when we were in college
well except for you woody
youre still living the fairy tale
swimsuit model wife
big job at an investment firm
youve got the good life
woody doesnt respond
he just stares vacantly into the fire for a beat
the good life
im a lucky man
my life blows
i dont have a family
or a wife
i have a cat that doesnt like me
she wouldnt even stick around if she knew how to use a can opener
the guys all look at dudley

theres a surprise
doug pulls a flaming marshmallow out of the fire
all right who wants their marshmallow well done
the guys just look at it
yeah i left that one on too long
doug flips the stick and the marshmallow goes flying behind him
the guys dont notice but we see the marshmallow land on the tent and continue to burn
bob continues to huff on the air mattress
he stops and looks at it
out of breath i think im half way there
wild hogs writers first draft
in just one hour
you sure you dont want us to spread out a sleeping bag
we have three in the doug turns around and sees a foot wide flame now burning on the tent
the tent doug and the guys jump up and hurry over to the tent
dudley get the water jug off my bike
dudley hurries over to dougs bike as doug and bob try to smother the flame with sand
it should be okay
its fire retardant
the guys try and extinguish the flame as dudley comes running with a jug
he quickly takes off the cap
doug notices him
thats its too late
dudley is already throwing it on the fire
the liquid hits the tent and it explodes into flames
the guys shield themselves
thats the spare gas tank dudley
dudley doesnt know what to say
the fire quickly disentergrates the tent
doug bob and woody just watch knowing theres nothing they can do
after a moment dudley runs back up with the correct water jug and empties it on what is now a flaming pile of ash
it does nothing
we need more water
that was all of it dudley
that was all the water we had
wild hogs writers first draft
dudley takes this in for a moment
is anybody else thirsty
the guys just look at him
bob doug woody and dudley are all sleeping on bobs air mattress like four sardines
doug opens his eyes to see a large figure standing at the foot of the air mattress
its a stern looking highway patrolman
you guys all right
yeah just on a road trip
just making sure
looks pretty comfortable actually
we see the highway patrolman has started rubbing his thigh
doug quickly jumps up waking the others
thanks for stopping
have a nice day officer
the highway patrolman laughs
all right i get it
fives a crowd
doug is mortified
the officer looks them over for a moment
you guys are lucky to have each other
looks at them hungrily damn lucky
wild hogs writers first draft
thats what i always say
dudley gets up and puts his arm around doug
we see hes wearing a saggy pair of briefs and nothing else
have a good one
the patrolman walks off
dudley looks at doug and grins
please put your pants on
the guys cruise through the rolling prairies of missouri
its another beautiful day
they ride in formation until woodys bandana doo rag blows off
woody goes back to get it
the other guys stop and wait for him to return
the guys are still riding but now the heat of the missouri plains is taking its toll
they look boiling and have sweated through their clothes
bob takes a drink of water from a bottle of water then pours the water over his head
he breathes a sigh of relief until he hears an angry yell behind him
he looks back and sees woody is now drenched from the water
bob smiles sheepishly as woody burns
the guys ride through the forested ozark uplands looking even hotter than before
doug spots a waterfall pouring into a crystal clear spring and points to it
the guys nod in agreement
wild hogs writers first draft
doug woody and dudley wade into the spring water in their boxers
you can see on their faces that its like dipping into heaven
after a moment bob walks up
thanks for waiting for me jerks
the guys look up to see that bob is naked
he smiles and cannonballs into the water
thats c c cold he sees doug woody and dudley are just staring at him
why are you naked
you guys kept on your skivies
what are you a newsie
i kept mine on because i didnt want everyone to see my crank
that and being naked with a bunch of guys is gay
whats wrong with you
i dont know
we took showers and stuff together in college
i thought this was kind of
you know the same
i guess i get that
i mean we would have been naked in college
why are we
we are tamed

wild hogs writers first draft
no were not

doug wiggles his boxers off and holds them in the air
i will find old doug
doug smiles and throws his shorts on the shore
dudley smiles takes off his briefs and holds them up
do what doug does
dudley throws the briefs to shore
they all look at woody
he rolls his eyes and takes off his boxers
i will be naked with my gay friends and if they look at my jock i will kill them
woody throws the boxers to shore
the guys all look at each other and smile
its a nice moment
until a family approaches
doug looks at the other guys wide eyed as a family with three young kids walks up with a picnic basket
the young kids run and jump into the water
the dad of the family laughs and shakes his head
hope you guys dont mind a little company
the mini van was getting a the dad stops talking as he sees into the water
he realizes then looks at his kids concerned
well were just taking a dip
i theres a shallower spring up the path
the kids might like that even more
the mom lays down a blanket and turns to the guys
the dad is still staring not sure what to do
wild hogs writers first draft
these little squirts like to the mom sees a glimmer of something through the water and realizes
she suddenly looks very uncomfortable
janey kyle holland
out of the water
were going to find a new spot
this place has little rocks get out of the damn water
the kids climb out of the water and the parents hurry off with them down the path
after a moment of awkward silence doug looks at the guys
we should go
theyre gone now
yeah we could stay another few whhheeeeew
the guys look to the other side of the spring to see the highway patrolman cannonball naked into the spring
they stare horrified as he pops up and smiles at them
saw youre bikes out there
you guys ever chicken fight
the guys look at each other for a moment then ahhhh
they frantically sprint out of the water grab their clothes and hurry away
wild hogs writers first draft
the guys are back on their bikes cruising along the wheat fields of kansas
theyre looking tired once again but suddenly doug smiles
on the horizon a bar comes into view
out front are several rows of harley davidsons
doug points it out to the guys and they all smile
its like an oasis
the pull into the parking lot and climb off their bikes
bob immediately falls to the ground
the guys go to help bob up as dudley gets off his bike and falls to the ground
you guys have to shift every once in awhile
blood has to circulate
a moment later
dudley and bob are up and wiggling their sleeping limbs as woody looks up at the bar
now this is the best part of any road trip
seeing our brothers on wheels
look at this place
the guys look at it and nod
it is a cool looking shack of a bar
doug admires the row of motorcycles out front
look at these bikes
theyre all classics
check it out
you know how rare this thing is
the guys all crowd around the bike
yeah but why didnt he customize it
you have a panhead and you dont chrome out the exhaust
or airbrush an eagle on the gas tank
what a waste
wild hogs writers first draft
probably no good custom stores out here in hick land
well leave em a catalog
the guys push open the door and step into the bar
the bar is full of bikers but not the kind we saw before
these guys are greasy tattooed and menacing
we see their jackets say hells angels
the bikers turn and stare at woody doug bob and dudley
hows it going
hells angels huh
you guys are legends
im surprised weve never seen you in daytona
the bikers kind of chuckle to themselves
the leader of the gang jack steps forward
hes in his late s and looks like he could break you into bite size pieces
yeah how do we keep missing that
the bikers all laugh
doug and the guys join in though they dont quite get whats so funny
so you re wild hogs huh
thats your gang
well not a gang
friends that ride
so its like a little hobby for you guys
doug smiles but is now sensing the hostility
he looks back for the exit
yeah just a little hobby for us
wild hogs writers first draft
were all successful professionals in real life
but on tuesday and sunday afternoons
dudley spins around and shows them the back of his jacket
can i try that on
hell yeah brother
dudley whips his jacket off and hands it to jack who pulls it on his massive frame
he shows it to the gang who laugh again
dudley does too
so whos panhead is that
woody has a catalog so you can make it cool
no i dont
i think its great the way it is
doug glares at woody incredulously
well if you like my we should trade
i just have a sportster
its worth like half of yours
thats what i grew up on
ive been wanting another sportster
its a deal
dudley maybe you should wild hogs writers first draft
doug dont worry
yeah ill have a cooler bike than you but that doesnt mean ill get all cocky
hey i dont care what you say
i ride a panhead now
im better than you
come on dud
lets go see how you look on it
jack smiles and leads dudley outside
doug bob and woody share an uncertain look
anybody else got that pre rape feeling
everyone is standing out front
dudley starts to get on the classic motorcycle
jack stops him
oh no no
thats oilcans ride
my panhead is right over there
jack points to a pile of abandoned rusty motorcycles
among it is the junked carcass of a panhead next to an old rusty sidecar
dudley looks confused
thats a piece of junk
your piece of junk
woody doug and bob look at each other
this isnt good
doug tries to laugh it off
all right guys
we get the joke
anyway we actually should get moving along
wild hogs writers first draft
oh its no joke
you want to know the joke
suburban assholes that buy leather outfits and think theyre bikers
and its a joke im damn sick of
so im keeping your friends bike im keeping this jacket and you guys are going to turn the hell around and go back to wherever you came from because the
next hundred miles of this highway belongs to the hells angels
the color drains from the wild hogs faces
like an adopt a highway thing
like a go home or were going to split your skulls open thing
bob makes an audible whimper
doug elbows him and tries to look brave
we respect that this is your turf and were sorry for bothering you
but we cant head back without my friends bike
so clearly were going to have to work something out here
jack looks back at the hells angels and nods
were going to have to work something out
we see doug bob and woody riding away from the bar looking very glum
the camera pulls out to reveal the rusty sidecar is now attached to woodys bike
dudley sits in it looking miserable and cold having lost his jacket and now in his sleeveless shirt
the guys get a good distance away from the bar and woody waves for them to stop
they do and woody looks back to the bar
wild hogs writers first draft
lets just give them a few minutes to get back inside then shoot right past them
are you nuts
the trips over woody
lets just head back home
were going to turn back after all these miles
just because some fat bullys pushed us around
woody shakes his head and looks at dudley
i go wherever you go
dudleys got some balls
no my sidecars just attached to your bike
id prefer to turn back but i could only roll so far
i cant believe you guys
what a bunch of pussies
the whole point of this trip is to live man
thats the point woody
our lives arent on this highway
theyre back home
we have families jobs wives
were not going to piss off a biker gang
were going back
woody takes this in gritting his teeth in disappointment
come on woody
you dont want to take this risk
you have claudia and your job
you have a great life back home
wild hogs writers first draft
woody looks up at him
something about this has sparked something in woodys eyes but he covers it up with a calm smile
youre right i do
but maybe i should talk to those guys one more time
i mean im an executive at an investment firm
ive made a career out of convincing people and these are just people
you guys wait here
woody starts up his bike
doug and bob look at each other and shrug
dudley hurries out of the sidecar
ill wait here too
youll get better gas mileage
dudley gets out and falls to the ground
woody shakes his head and starts back to the bar
woody rides up to the bar and looks back to make sure hes out of doug bob and dudleys sight
he sees that he is and kneels next to the line of hells angels motorcycles
he takes out an army knife and slices through one of the motorcycles gas line
gas starts leaking out onto the ground and woody nods
come after us now assholes
woody goes along to each bike smiling with a weird recklessness as he slices through each gas line
woody pulls up on his bike where doug bob and dudley are waiting
theyre cool with it
we can press on
wild hogs writers first draft
i tried to be polite
i tried to reason
i told them dudley was dying
well technically were all dying dudley
just very slowly
dudley looks concerned
oh my god youre right
im slowly dying
anyway none of that worked
so i laid it out for them
i said hey go ahead and assault us
because we might be not be real bikers but we know real lawyers
and the moment you touch us is the moment you get your ass sued
because this is the real world with real laws and real consequences
and they backed down
the guys are impressed
you really said that
and i think theyll give us dudleys bike on the way back so lets go
before they change their mind
woody quickly starts his bike and rides on
the guys shrug impressed and follow him
after a moment we see them all speed by the bar
jack is playing darts with the other bikers
he goes to throw a dart and hears engines roar past the bar outside
wild hogs writers first draft
he quickly turns which makes the dart he was throwing fly off target and stick into the shoulder of one of the bikers oilcan
jack listens as the engines pass the bar and fade away
jack shakes his head enraged
saddle up boys
somebody doesnt listen
the guys nod and head outside
oilcan pulls the dart out of his shoulder and stops by jack on the way out
try and watch the throws okay jack
jack glares at oilcan for a beat then jabs a dart into his peck
off jacks icy glare sorry
the hells angels roar away from the bar on their motorcycles
they get to the end of the driveway and the bikes sputter and choke to a stop
angle on jack
hes on his hog with a cigarette dangling out of his mouth
he looks down in confusion at the suddenly stalled bike
what the f sees cut gas line youve gotta be kidding me
suddenly the cigarette falls out of jacks mouth and onto the ground
a puddle of gas from the sliced line catches on fire
the flames quickly follow the line of leaked gas like a fuse back towards the bar
wild hogs writers first draft
almost as quickly as the bikers can turn to look the flame has reached the parking area and ignited all the puddles of gas
they all watch in horror as the fire ravenously engulfs the old wooden porch of the bar then the roof
the guys happily cruise along the highway
we see woody look in his side view mirror and notice a large black plume of smoke back in the distance
a look of worry creeps over his face
the guys pull up to a small motel as the sun sets behind the wheat fields of kansas
no were not stopping here
riding at night is half the fun
lets just keep i cant feel my nuts woody
and kelly still wants another kid
doug bob and dudley head inside the motel office
calling after doug so adopt a kid
you already have two white ones anyway
the guys ignore him
woody looks back down the highway uneasily then heads inside the motel office
jack and the other bikers stand by the smoldering pile of wood that was once their bar
oilcan approaches jack
i got my old lady bringing some gas
we can get moving by nightfall
those guys are long gone
wild hogs writers first draft
theyre not stupid enough to stop until theyre five hundred miles from here
doug bob and dudley are in their motel room
woody stands at the window nervously looking outside
i just think its just stupid to stop this soon you know
we can keep riding under the stars
woody your headlight doesnt even work
you think i wont ride without light
i can feel the road
ill even race somebody
whos racing me
did you inhale exhaust fumes
because something is happening to your brain
i think it might be retardation
i just want to ride
doug shrugs woody off and dials his cell phone
woody glares at doug
youre calling kelly
youre not aloud to call wives on a road trip
i can call my wife whenever i want
wild hogs writers first draft
yeah im having a great time
no old doug yet but i havent gotten sun burned
woody looks at bob
you agree with me right
yeah i actually agree with you on this one
lets not call wives
yeah bob agreed with him
good guess again
man i really miss you
are you kidding me
i have to leave
let me know when lame hour is over
woody you can call claudia when im done if you want
you can use my cell
no im not calling claudia
i mean yes i want to but i wont
because im on a road trip with my pals
and cell phones arent even allowed
woody storms out
doug hears something on the phone and lights up
hows it then into phone whered he go
he thought you were ordering pizza
well tell him i said hi
doug bob woody and dudley ride along the highway as the sun burns the morning fog off of the wheat fields
doug looks over to woody and yells above the motorcycle engines
wild hogs writers first draft
i cant believe you made us leave so early
you really wanted to see the sun rise
it warms my heart with its
doug gives him a curious look as they pass a sign that says lucas kansas
population yelling over engines hey
lets stop for breakfast im starving
were not hungry yet
i just said i was youre not
bob looks hurt
doug gives woody a stern look
come on woody
it looks like a neat town
and dudleys got another bag of poop to throw away
woody grits his teeth as they enter the town
its a quiet one stop light town with an old fashioned main street and town square
we see a banner over the street advertising a block party that night
its a postcard version of small town america
the owner bud is pressed up against the glass watching the motorcycles come down main street
he shakes his head
oh dont tell me theyre here again already
i just got the window replaced
wild hogs writers first draft
bud walks back to the bar past his daughter and diner waitress maggie pretty in that cute small town way
just stay calm dad
at least its not all of them this time
the guys pull up to the diner and we see the local pedestrians hustle away
the street is soon deserted but the guys dont notice
they go to park their bikes but theres not enough space
theres a police car in the parking spot next to them and the town sheriff charley comes running towards it from across the street
ill move it
hold on ill move it
charley jumps into the car and backs it out of its spot
the guys look at each other surprised
lucas is a polite town
thats how these little towns are
its unspoiled america
its a shithole
lets keep moving
the guys ignore woody and enter the diner
okay well get it to go then
we can ride and eat if its wrapped in a tortilla
woody gets no response
he looks back down the road uneasily then follows the guys in
bob doug woody and dudley enter with their motorcycle boots thunking on the wood floor announcing to the entire diner that there are bikers there
wild hogs writers first draft everyone freezes and the place goes silent
the only sound is a single fork dropping onto a plate
bud is pulsing with anger but he swallows it down
good morning gentleman
how nice of you to join us this afternoon
well how could we pass through this town without stopping
everything looks so perfect
but youll change that huh
maggie runs up and guides her dad away from the guys
ill take care of them daddy
to guys extra polite good morning
she has a radiant sweetness even though shes scared to death
dudley stares at her captivated
hes in love
where would you gentleman like to sit
are there any booths open
all the people quickly jump out of their booths
everyone is so nice here
the guys sit in one of the booths
dudley hangs back and struggles to talk to maggie
dudley tries to think of something else to say but cant
he nods awkwardly then heads over to the booth
he sits down with the guys
wild hogs writers first draft
you like the waitress huh
i wanted to say something funny to her but i could only think of black jokes
maggie still very skittish approaches the table
and what would you gentleman like today
doug looks to the next table where a man is enjoying french toast
ill have what hes having
maggie nods obediently and takes the mans plate
she slides it in front of doug
ill take a new one
he can keep his
im so sorry
maggie quickly puts it back on the mans table
hey its okay
not a big deal
yeah just dont let it happen again
bob hammers his fist on the table and laughs at his joke but maggie starts to cry
the guys suddenly look confused as she runs to the kitchen in tears
bob looks back to the guys
that wasnt funny
wild hogs writers first draft
its hard to be funny without being racist
doug is looking at the towns local paper and smiles
this block party tonight looks cool
music grilled corn dollar beers funnel cakes
lets stay here tonight
no no no no
we have a schedule
san francisco is waiting
you said were taking this trip to live
lets stick around and live a little
have some small town fun
woody goes to protest again but dudley stands up
lets party all night in lucas
from kitchen area god dammit
whatd we do to deserve this
we angle to see maggie rush over to calm bud down
bud calms down then hears another motorcycle engine roaring down the street
he looks out the window and shakes his head
not another one of these assholes
a moment later murdock a fat grungy hells angel enters the diner with a cocky swagger and has a seat at the bar
get me a beer old man
and if its not good im going to smash it across your face
wild hogs writers first draft
angle on the wild hogs watching from the table behind murdock
sotto to the guys not another one of these assholes
murdock hears this and whips around to see the wild hogs
whatd you say
oh i was actually referring to some guys we met at a bar about two hundred miles east of here
youre probably not thats my gang
im on my way there now
loudly to doug so he is one of those assholes doug
murdock puts his beer down and stares angrily at doug
and who the hell are you freaks
doug starts to answer but woody looking nervous cuts him off
oh were just a group of friends
no big deal
your guys gave us permission to pass by so its all good
hells angels dont give permission
especially to a bunch of ball less wimps like you
bob hammers the table and stands up his face red with long suppressed rage
im not a wimp pal
im a man
you got that
you got that
wild hogs writers first draft
the guys look at bob wide eyed
woody looks worried
bob lets not get carried away no you know what
this guy needs a talking to just like his friends did woody
i dont think let me do this woody
you stood up to them last time and i just sat there like i always do
well not this time
turns to murdock listen you piece of shit
you think you can just walk around and bully perfectly nice people
you think thats how it works
well guess what
this is the real world
with real laws and real consequences
you hear me
bob swats murdocks beer out of his hand
it spills all over him
murdock is too filled with rage to speak
now get out of here
and if that gang of inbred assholes needs things explained to them again tell em the wild hogs will be right here in lucas tonight
woody puts his face into his hands
murdock just stares daggers at him
bob kicks the stool out from under murdock
he almost falls but catches himself on a stool
he glares at the guys but hes outnumbered
he grits his teeth and storms out the door
woody winces to himself as he watches murdock go
this isnt good
after a moment bud comes running out from behind the bar
wild hogs writers first draft
you guys arent hells angels
were from cincinnati
bud calls out to the kitchen
they aint the bad ones
charley the sheriff from before stands up from behind a countertop in the kitchen
you guys arent hells angels
were wild hogs
thats our gang
and our rotary club softball team
my wife had extra patches
well sweet mary joseph
welcome to lucas
im the sheriff charley baskins
i keep the peace here
werent you just hiding in the kitchen
a non confrontation approach sometimes is the best method to keep aggression
yeah i was hiding in the kitchen
charley looks at them for a moment then starts to tear up
im an embarrassment
charley hurries off to the bathroom
the guys look at each other
well now he is
wild hogs writers first draft
charley walks through the town square with doug bob woody and dudley
theres a stage and booths set up around the park in the center ready for the block party
as the news spreads that the wild hogs are friendly the townspeople start to take to the streets again
sorry about all the confusion when you arrived
those guys are pretty rough
youre the first people to ever stand up to them
well woody is the one who really hey we should probably share the credit
i mean i just basically kicked that guys ass
you know how good that felt
bob punches a handicapped parking sign which rattles against its post then falls to the ground
bob immediately looks regretful
now the paraplegics can park down the block and get more exercise
suddenly meek again should i fix it
i didnt mean to forget about it
we only have one cripple and he gets pulled around in a wagon
come on i want to show you guys something
charley leads the guys off
charley flips on the light in a neatly organized police garage
in the middle sits a sparkling unridden harley davidson police bike
wild hogs writers first draft
you ride this
the hells angels would take it to pieces if they ever saw me on it
i just keep it in here
polish it and so forth
but id never let them see it
those guys are that big of a problem huh
they ride into town a few times a month and get drunk damage property
basically turn the place upside down
and the police dont do anything
well its a small town and me and the dooble brothers are the only law
and theyre still pretty green
cant you call a bigger town or something for backup
yeah ive done that a few times
but the gang is always gone by the time they get here
weve also tried wearing riot gear which does protect you from being hit but not from being dragged
also one of the dooble brothers tried to throw tear gas but the bottle exploded and blew off his ear
yeah hes hard to look at
anyway we want you guys to stay at our hotel tonight on us
seeing as youre the new town heroes and all
wild hogs writers first draft
the guys look flattered
oh thanks but were actually moving on wed be honored to stay
woodys looks at doug in protest
doug gives him a stern glare
and if youre not in a rush to leave in the morning weve got a great trout stream you might want to check out
lets do it
no im putting my foot down here
i still get a vote on what we do you know
and i want my vote
of course you get a vote
woody nods and looks at bob and dudley
they clearly intend to stay
i actually get three votes
because i planned the trip
but you didnt plan the voting system
so you only get one
doug bob and dudley walk off
you know what
old doug wasnt such a douchebag
wild hogs writers first draft
murdock has arrived at the bar which is just a burned shack at this point
the hells angels are gathered around watching jack beat the crap out of a remaining wall with a pipe
he finally stops when the wall has crumbled
those assholes think they can cross the hells angels
do you know how bad theyve made us all look
the gang nods
they all look pissed
those guys have some balls
balls i will put in my mouth and chew on
the gang looks at jack with a slight smile
youre going to put balls in your mouth
the gang laughs
jack realizes what the joke is
im not im going to put my foot up their asses
hell im going to stick anything i can in their asses and im going to enlov it
the guys start laughing again
jack boils red
i didnt mean just get on your damn bikes
were riding to lucas
the guys start towards their bikes
oilcan sidles up next to jack
sometimes it helps if you say things in your mind first then say it out loud you know
jack looks at oilcan for a beat then bends down picks a dart up out of the ash and jabs it into his shoulder
wild hogs writers first draft
i did that in my mind first
jack smiles calmly and walks off
doug bob woody and dudley exit out of an old fashioned hotel next to the diner
they cross to the town square where the block party is in full swing
townspeople mingle around eating corn on the cob and hotdogs
up on the stage a plump middle aged man with a goatee and a polo shirt tucked into dockers sings justin timberlakes rock your body
so you grab your girls and you grab a couple more
and you all come meet me in the middle of the floor
gonna rock your body
till the break of the man drops to his knees at the edge of stage and reaches his hand out to the audience like the star of a boy band
however its clearly making the people on the dance floor uncomfortable
meanwhile doug bob woody and dudley walk through the square and are instantly greeted patted on the back and thanked by each townsperson they pass
the word is out that these guys are heroes
doug gives a can you believe this
look to the other guys who are just as thrilled as him
theyre eating it up
these people love us
this is nuts
they think were bad asses
well lets not get too carried away with it
the truth is were just regular guys
lets not forget that
yeah the best thing is to keep a low profile
dont cause any waves
then if somebody pushes us too far boom
we go billy jack upside their heads
wild hogs writers first draft
youre going to go billy jack
im just minding my own business
i dont want to cause any trouble
dudley turns to woody and stares at him
woody looks confused
hes waiting for you to say something else then hes going to kick you
dudley gets a deflated look and backs off of woody
doug just saved you a world of hurt
youre afraid of your cat
he once bit me on the sack
dudley walks off towards the beer tent
woody looks to the other guys with a puzzled look
he was unclogging his bathtub drain and the cat thought it was a ball of yarn
doug and woody wince
angle on dudley at the beer tent
he gets in line and realizes hes behind maggie
she smiles at him
dudley is wide eyed
i uh what do you call a mercedes in harlem
wild hogs writers first draft
maggie looks confused
maggie notices the tattoo on dudleys shoulder
you like macs too huh
ive got a vintage apple e
restored it from scratch
dudleys jaw drops
i have a cookie jar made out of a e
for fig newtons
i like fig newtons
dudley collects himself and tries to speak
theyre like fried chicken at a no thats not
this is hard
maggie smiles sweetly as dudley fumbles
you want to dance
dudley goes to respond then decides to just give an emphatic nod
doug bob and woody are sitting at a picnic table drinking beer out of plastic cups
they lean back and soak up the small town celebration around them
its a great night
it doesnt get any better than this huh
bob notices doug getting ready to chomp down on a piece of garlic bread
wild hogs writers first draft
thats a lot of carbs
doug stops mid bite and puts the bread down
you saved me from all that
buttery garlicky flavor
no he didnt
woody takes the garlic bread and crams it in his mouth
i hope you choke on it
charley approaches with his two deputies earl dooble and buck dooble
they are chubby thirty year old twins identical in every way except for the fact that buck is missing an ear on the right side of his head
which the skin has scarred back over
it doesnt look good
welcome to the block party
these are my deputies earl and buck dooble
earl shakes the guys hands
im earl and hes buck
just remember the brother with the word ear in his name has both on his head
i can only say that because im on his right side
which as you can see is blown off
earl laughs again as buck extends his hand oblivious
im buck and this is earl
good luck telling us apart
buck laughs and turns to charley exposing his missing ear to the guys
they draw back a little
wild hogs writers first draft
well its nice to meet you guys
youve got a great town here
yeah we got everything here
good people good fishing
we do have convicted child molesters though
we have to disclose that
not if they dont have kids earl
just to be safe though
yells at crowd of people hey
a bookish man with a tweed jacket turns around and looks
convicted child molester
thomas milborn nods glumly and pulls his hands out of his pockets
the guys look at each other uneasily
still a nice town
if youre not a kid
or thomas milborn
dudley is on the dance floor with maggie
the middle aged guy on stage is letting loose with a rendition of ushers yeah
maggie and dudley dance conservatively for a moment but as the beat gets ahold of dudley he starts getting into it
he starts spinning around at a rapid pace then drops to his knees slaps the ground and shakes his head to the music
maggie watches curiously as dudley pulls himself along the ground by his elbows then springs up to his feet and starts a move that resembles a sprinkler
maggie grins actually amused by dudleys rhythmic passion
wild hogs writers first draft
angle on the wild hogs table
the guys sit with charley buck and earl watching dudley with a curious look
looks like your friend and maggie are hitting it off
i think he really likes that girl
well maggies a great woman
big cans too
buck liked her but you know
hes a deformed freak
buck on earls left stares out at maggie and dudley deaf to the conversation
i used to like that girl
but then i realized i can do better
the guys look at buck
so why are you guys taking this road trip anyway
ahh just to escape for a bit
hey were not escaping anything man
were on this trip to live
i know what you mean
sometimes things in life can bother you and sometimes nothing in life can bother you
either way youve got take a break from it
happiness is somewhere between boredom and stress
doug is surprised at charleys insight
so is woody
which is why we need to keep riding until we figure out where that happiness is
you dont get old doug back by just staying put
wild hogs writers first draft
apparently ive lost him
i dont sing bon jovi anymore
you did lose him doug
you know why
youre too comfortable
youve got to snap out of it
doug nods halfheartedly
he knows woody might be right
woodys got a point there
comfortable can be a bad thing
you have to wake up and slap the bull once in a while
slap the bull
then to charley what
slapping the bull is kind of the local test of manhood
its a way to prove you arent controlled by fear
weve all done it
even torn open head here
he nods at buck on his left
you know i slapped the bull once
woody smiles slyly
doug looks concerned
were slapping the bull
i dont think we need to
i mean we can have our own test of manhood
lets see how many ears of corn we can eat or something
doug grabs an ear of corn and takes a bite but woody just grins with that reckless look in his eyes
wild hogs writers first draft
we are slapping the bull
doug knows its no use
he nods defeated
doug bob woody charley buck and earl approach a fence surrounding a pasture
here we are
the lucas test of manhood
slap the bull
charley gestures to a lone bull grazing in the pasture
hes a frighteningly large bull with enormous horns
so its literally slapping a bull
right on the ass
then high tail it out of there because he can kill ya
this was your idea so
im going in
im gonna slap the shit out of that bull
like pimp style
the guys look at him surprised and somewhat impressed
woody takes a breath and climbs over the fence
he approaches the bull very quietly and cautiously
he gets within three feet of it leans in and slaps the bull hard on the ass
the bull makes an annoyed sound and turns around but woody is already hightailing it back to the fence with an exhilarated look on his face
wild hogs writers first draft
woody gets to the fence and hurls himself over
the guys all applaud
that felt so good
i just slapped a big fat bull right on his ass
did you hear how pissed he was
i just pissed of a bull
back to bull bitch
woody high fives all the guys
im slapping that bull
the guys cheer as doug climbs over the fence and starts heading towards the bull
the group all leans on the fence watching
thanks for bringing us out here
doug really needs this
this is good for him
glad we could help
yeah and weve never seen it done twice in a row
itll be interesting to see how the bull takes being slapped now that hes alert
woody and bob look at each other then to the bull which doug is about to slap
its too late
doug slaps the bull hard and turns to run
wild hogs writers first draft
doug runs across the field but the bull now fully alert swivels with magnificent agility and breaks into an angry charge towards doug
the guys all watch in horror as the bull quickly gains on doug
doug sees the fear on the guys faces and looks back over his shoulder
his smile quickly turns to terror
its too late
the bull catches doug and bucks him into the air
doug flies ten feet and comes crashing down on the muddy grass
the bull takes a few steps back and starts lining up another charge at him
oh no you dont
woody jumps over the fence and runs into the field
come get me bull
the bull notices woody and starts to charge him
doug climbs to his feet and sees the bull charging woody
woody realizes hes in trouble and starts to run again
the bull quickly catches him and rams him into the air
woody lands hard with a grunt
the bull turns back to charge at woody again and bob jumps over the fence
leave him alone
you want some of this
come get this
bob sprints out into the field
the bull snorts and starts towards him
the bull closes on bob quick but at the last moment bob dives of the way
the bull goes flying past him
missed me you fat bastard
wild hogs writers first draft
doug and woody look impressed as bob helps them hurry towards the fence
charley and buck hold a gate open for them as the bull makes a turn and lines the group up but theyve already made it to the gate
they go through and charley shuts it behind them
they lean back on the fence trying to gather their bearings except bob who is thrilled
did you see me
i dodged him
i dodged that stupid cow
how cool am suddenly the bull charges into the fence which bobs butt is sticking through
bob goes flying and lands face down in the dirt
he scrambles back up furious
you son of a bitch
you want to keep it going
you want to take cheap shots
bob tries to climb back into the pasture but the guys restrain him
give me your gun
give me the gun
he deserves it
ill kill you
doug and woody hold on to bob until he calms down
doug and woody start to laugh
bob cools off for another moment then starts laughing as well
no this is living
we just slapped the bull
the group high fives each other in congratulations and starts away bruised muddy and laughing
angle on the bull
he pushes on the gate that charley was holding open
the gate swings open
angle on woody bob and doug
they walk with charley and the dooble brothers laughing and carrying on
wild hogs writers first draft
bob does an impression of how he dodged it and goes for some more high fives but suddenly the bull charges into frame and nails him
as bob goes flying we the block party is winding down
dudley is sitting by himself at a picnic table in post maggie bliss
doug woody and bob approach dirty and beaten from the bull but carrying on happily
man did you see the look on bobs face when he got up
didnt dodge him that time
woody and doug laugh
bob looks pissed
im going to go back there with a rifle tomorrow and shoot one of his legs off
then well see whos tough
why just one leg
because i want to kick him in the face
doug and woody laugh again
bob just steams
they spot dudley and head over to him
you look happy
i danced with her
and she likes macs
you know what that means
you have a sister
i have a soulmate
i thought you said the color ipod was your soulmate
wild hogs writers first draft
i thought it was
but now i realize that ipod was just a well designed whore
the guys smile
its been a good night for all of them
lets go back to the hotel
weve got to get up early to do some fishing
the guys start walking towards the main street hotel
but after fishing we hit the open road and keep moving okay
open road baby
wild hogs ride
the guys continue with enthusiastic cheers as we hear the off screen rumble of engines
doug looks down the street and sees the hells angels
all forty of them are riding into town and the guys will be in their view any second
woody is frozen with fear
are you kidding me
woody youre going to have to talk to these guys again
get them to leave this town alone hiiiiiiiidee
doug bob and dudley look confused
woody looks around desperately for somewhere to hide but the hells angels are too close
theres no time
woody spots a port o potty from the block party and starts corralling doug bob and dudley into it
woody pushes his puzzled friends into the port o potty then gets in with them and shuts the door just as the hells angels cruise by them
wild hogs writers first draft
all four guys are squished inside the port o potty like sardines
what the hell is wrong with shhhh
theyll hear you
dont make a sound
the hells angels park their bikes
we see all the townspeople have stopped enjoying themselves and just stand there scared
jack gets off his bike and looks around
good evening lucas
now as hurt as i am that youre having a party and didnt invite us
were only here for one reason
the wild hogs
where the hell are they
doug looks at woody
hes starting to figure it out
woody guiltily avoids dougs glare and watches the hells angels through a vent in the port o potty
the townspeople arent saying a word
jack continues to pace in front of the diner
come on now
you shouldnt be protecting them
these wild hogs not only passed us when we specifically told them not to they drained out all our gas and burned down our bar
like the little cowards they are
now where are they
wild hogs writers first draft
upon hearing this bob dudley and doug all look at woody who shrugs sheepishly
bob is enraged
you son of a bitch
bob lunges at woody but the sudden shifting of weight is too much for the port o potty
the port o potty tips over
all the hells angels turn and look as it crashes over on its side
they continue to stare at it curiously
the guys now on their side freeze as they see through the vent that the hells angels are staring at them
its a very tense moment as they wait to see if theyve been discovered
after a moment we hear a glup glup glup and the guys smell something curious
what is that
its that blue port o potty juice
its coming out of the can
the guys all cringe in disgust but know they cant move
jack finally turns away from the pot o potty and smirks
now thats a port o potty that aint worth shit
the hells angels all laugh and turn back to the diner
wild hogs writers first draft
all right then
nobody wants to tell me where they are
maybe thisll jar your memory
jack takes a garbage can and tosses it into the diner window
the crowd gasps as the hells angels laugh
charley steps out of the crowd
i think theyre out at mckinleys pasture
something about slapping a bull
its up past the lake a ways
to hells angels saddle up boys
the guys get on their bikes
and if they aint there
well be back reeeal soon
because i dont let any man get away from me
the gang snickers
jack realizes shut the hell up
i didnt you know what i meant
jack starts his bike and roars out of the town
the others follow him gunning their bikes and leaving skid marks and smoke in their trail
a kid yells at the hells angels as they ride out of sight
go ahead and come back
the wild hogs arent afraid you
the wild hogs arent afraid of anything
suddenly the door pops open on the port o potty and the wild hogs topple out of it in a heap
we see theyre soaked in blue port o potty juice
they scramble to their feet and run towards the large fountain in the middle of the town square
wild hogs writers first draft
im going to vomit
the townspeople watch in silence as the guys jump into the fountain and try to rinse off
bob puts his head under a water spouting marble fish
it got in my hair
the guys desperately try to rinse off the juice then drenched from head to toe turn their glare to woody
you lied didnt you
you stood there and lied to us
youre a stinking liar
i did it for you guys
i wanted you to live
were going to die woody
you burned down their bar
we are dead men
i thought it was going to happen slowly
i thought i had time
dudley sits on the fountain edge and starts to tear up
im sorry okay
yes im sorry
i just didnt want us to go back
its just a stupid vacation
wild hogs writers first draft
because i dont have anything to go back to okay
doug and bob go silent
woody looks away trying to collect himself
after a moment he faces them
ive lost everything
the firm fired me claudia left me
its all gone
my whole life is gone
i dont even have enough money to get my lawn raked anymore
doug bob and dudley are stupefied
woody takes a deep breath and continues
thats why i couldnt go back
this isnt a vacation for me its the only thing i have left
theres nothing more in my life but you guys
so i lied about the hells angels
i lied because i wanted to have one thing in my life that wasnt a complete failure
a real trip with my best friends
youre all i got
woody lowers his head
the guys take this in for a minute
woody looks at them waiting for their sympathy
finally doug speaks
realizing to woody this trip is just you running from your life
your miserable screwed up life
and you knew you couldnt go back to it so instead you screwed up our lives too
woodys puppy dog face dissolves
i see how important i am to you guys
thats just fine
i just thought being a wild hog meant something
woody takes off his wild hogs jacket and throws it at their feet
he hops out of the fountain and storms off down the street
wild hogs writers first draft
it doesnt mean anything
its just a patch my wife made
doug bob and dudley look at each other
after a moment they look over to the sidewalk and see all the townspeople staring at them in disappointed silence
slowly the townspeople turn and quietly head back to their homes
doug bob and dudley lower their heads in disgrace
so much for being heroes
doug stands in the darkened police station with dudley charley buck and earl
charley looks out the window with doug
looks like theyre winding down some
the hells angels have returned and set up shop in the diner but are also flowing out onto the street
jack stumbles into the middle of the road with a bottle of tequila in his hand
alright wild hogs
we know youre in town somewhere cause you havent checked out of the hotel
were a little smarter than you thought huh
hell yeah we are
oilcan smashes a beer can against his own head
so were going to wait right here till you show up
weeks if we have to
hell we might just make ourselves the lucas angels
that has a nice ring to it doesnt it
wild hogs writers first draft
the guys watch the commotion through the window
i was thinking of that for us
you guys just stay in the station tonight
no one needs to go out there and be a hero and end up getting hurt
charley and the dooble brothers look a little surprised
youre not going out there
doug sighs in irritation
well youre the cop
why dont you go out there
charley is visibly hurt
his lip starts to tremble
thats not cool man
charley runs out the back door of the station
earl shakes his head and looks at doug
you know people have feelings
sure i make comments about chum face here
but thats because every time i look at him i see parts of his brain
but nobody has the right to hurt charley like that
he has both sides of his head
earl storms off leaving buck who was standing on his left and hasnt heard or seen any of them leave
he stands there looking at doug and dudley
wild hogs writers first draft
buck turns and sees earl and charley have gone
son of a bitch
buck hurries out the door after charley and earl
doug wakes up on a cot in an open jail cell
he walks out of the cell and over to the window
angle on the main street diner the hells angels bikes are still parked outside and the bikers appear to be passed out in various booths chairs and the street out
back on the police station
dudley and bob approach the window
theyre still out there
well i talked to karen
she going to fly out here rent a mini van and pick us up
well just ship the bikes back later
bob we cant leave
theyll just stay here and keep terrorizing this town
they can call the national guard or something
to be stationed here permanently
because these guys will just come back when theyre gone
and itll be even worse
wild hogs writers first draft
weve created this problem bob
weve got to think of a way to solve it
well karen is really insistent she come drive us back
tell her no bob
bob looks uncomfortable at this thought
i cant do that
well youre going to have to bob
were not going to screw over an entire town because youre afraid of women
bob stands up insulted
oh sorry im not brave like you doug
the guy who gets injections in his scalp so he wont go bald
bob storms out the back door of the police station
dudley looks to doug curiously
doug shrugs weakly
you know you can storm out too if you want
i mean i thought about going to see maggie while those guys are asleep but you need me right now
doug smiles and gives dudley a squeeze on the shoulder
dudley is clearly disappointed having assumed doug would tell him to go see maggie
dudley just stands there silent
wild hogs writers first draft
youre always asking me if im okay
dudley quickly storms out of the police station
doug nods to himself and slumps down on an office chair
doug exits and looks around the corner of the building making sure the hells angels are still sleeping then starts walking towards a wooded park behind the town
doug walks through the park looking depressed
he passes through a small playground and has a seat on a bench
he watches all the children play and his eyes fall on four young boys happily riding their bicycles together
they have cards in their spokes making engine sounds as they ride around having a great time together
doug smiles and watches them play together
thought you might be out here
doug turns and sees bud the owner of the diner bud has a seat next to him
look im sorry we got your town in all this trouble
this trip was supposed to fix problems not cause them
well maybe its trying to and you just wont let it
what do you mean
bud smiles and looks out at the kids playing
wild hogs writers first draft
its the funny thing about life
it has to be an adventure to feel right
but when you become a husband and a dad you realize adventure is risk and a family man has no place in his life for risk
doug takes this in then realizes
thats why i stopped singing bon jovi
life used to be a risk
that was old doug
and now its gone
ive taken away all the risk
and if you try to make livin too safe then its not livin at all
and i have a will now
so i only have so much livin left
and somehow ive lost the best part of it
well maybe these will help you find it
bud puts a styrofoam container on dougs lap
doug looks into it
these are worms
to fish with
i dont get it
friends that screw up
thats not something you should be avoiding
thats something you need
doug takes this in
whats that have to do with worms
go down to the lake and find out
wild hogs writers first draft
bud smiles and walks off
doug looks down at the worms considering
doug walks up to the shore and sees woody trying to push a canoe towards the water
woody notices doug
woody gets the canoe to the water and looks back at doug
ive got worms
i mean in here
doug holds up the styrofoam cup
doug helps woody shove the boat out into the water
they both hop in as it floats away from the shore
they sit there staring off in silence
im sorry about claudia
and the job
but you shouldnt have lied to us you know what
i screwed up
maybe from now on im better off just doing things on my own
woody starts to get up but then looks at the water around him and sits
wild hogs writers first draft
you would have stormed off right then huh
doug nods and looks out at the water
they sit there in silence for another moment
i didnt want to lose doug
ive lost everything else and i didnt want to lose this trip with you guys
when were together its like were all college kids still
im not a guy with a broken marriage and failed career
im just with my best friends being happy
and to keep it going i forgot about what made it so great
that friends never let each other down
i screwed up the last thing i had left
you guys deserve better
im sorry woody eyes water a little and he quickly turns away from doug
they sit there for another moment
well whats the point of being in a motorcycle gang if we cant ourselves in a little trouble
woody looks back at him
doug smiles a little bit
itll be okay man
woody smiles a little as well
they wont kill us right
really bad beating
we wont die
i dont think
and how much could a punch really hurt
not much probably
wild hogs writers first draft
well the good thing is well be able to know for sure
thatll be cool
lets go find the bob and dudley
doug looks around the canoe for a paddle
did you bring the paddles
i wasnt even going to take this thing out but i didnt want you to think i was just standing at the lake waiting for you
why were you here
bud told me to stand at the lake and wait for you
bob walks up on the shore holding a styrofoam cup
bob looks at the styrofoam cup and nods
are we all good
were all good
woody smiles at doug
throw us that paddle
bob nods and picks up a paddle
he throws it toward the canoe but it lands ten yards short and sinks
wild hogs writers first draft
bob grabs another paddle and throws it
this time it lands even shorter
bob looks around for another paddle
were those the only two paddles
bob sits down on the grass
you guysll drift in
woody and doug look around at the water
its as still as glass
they sit there awkwardly as bob waits on shore
a cook from the diner is at the kitchen stove making something in a big pot as a crowd of townspeople eat in the kitchen and dining room
maggie and dudley cross through the kitchen and out to the front porch
maggie sits on the porch swing and takes a breath
well we cant seat many people in there but at least were back in business
sorry those jerks are in your diner
ah were used to them costing us money
last year we spent more on window glass than pancake batter
all because of them
wild hogs writers first draft
it makes me sick
thinking theyre too good for pancakes
no i meant
they damage the diner a lot
they damage the whole town
im just sorry you guys got dragged into it
you were just out to have a good vacation
dudley looks at maggie sincerely
this has been the best vacation of my life
i met you
you bikers probably tell all the girls that
this hits dudley
he suddenly looks troubled
maggie i have to tell you something
im not really a cool biker or a cool
im a computer programmer
my cat doesnt even like me
she watches me sleep and i dont know why
i think shes waiting for me to stop breathing
im just a
im sorry if you thought i was somebody im not
maggie takes this in
after a moment she smiles and kisses dudley
youre not a geek dudley
youre sweet and your honest and
youre the coolest guy i know
your cat is crazy if it doesnt like you as much as i do
he has completely fallen for her
well i better get back inside
ive got to set some chairs up in the family room for the lunch rush
people gotta eat
wild hogs writers first draft
maggie smiles and heads inside
dudley watches her go then grits his teeth
oh people will eat
dont you worry maggie
people will eat
dudley kicks open the front door
jack and the other hells angels are inside drinking and carrying on
alright lets end this
the hells angels dont even notice him
dudley bites his lip in frustration
dudley takes a table full of empty beer glasses and flips it over
everyone in the diner goes silent and looks at him
jack stands up and smiles
one of you came to face the music huh
the hells angels laugh
dudley takes a deep breath and walks up to jack
im not here to face any music
im here to make you a deal
a deal i think youd be smart to take
you leave the town of lucas and my friends alone and i do something for you
something you cant live without
jack looks interested
dudley confidently sets a laptop on the counter and punches a few keys
he swivels it around to show the gang
wild hogs writers first draft
see where that says domain for sale
guess what that means
your gang doesnt have a website
no way to tell people about your history post photos sell shirts
you guys are living in the complete dark ages
laughs cockily then so they way i see it i need a favor from you and you need a favor from me
jack walks over to the computer and looks at dudley for a moment
he then picks the computer up and smashes it down on the ground
it breaks into a hundred pieces
jack smiles at dudley and puts his foot through whats left of it
the hells angels stifle laughter
dudley is starting to look a little nervous
thanks for hearing me out
dudley starts for the door but several hells angels move over and block his path
dudley stops and collects himself for a moment then breaks into a panicked sprint for the other exit
the hells angels quickly spring into action and tackle him to the ground
the hells angels pull off him confused
you have to take me to a church and leave me alone
the hells angels look at each other and shrug
no we dont
wild hogs writers first draft
the hells angels move back in on him
dudley closes his eyes and rolls into a ball
doug bob and woody are walking back from the lake and pass by maggies house
bud standing on the porch sees them and smiles
if youre heading back to town i wouldnt go on an empty stomach
the guys see bud and smile
come have lunch
this is kind of our fallout diner
smaller kitchen but less piss on the bathroom floor
well we can change that
bud laughs as the guys enter the house
doug bob and woody are sitting at one of many card tables arranged in the family room eating lunch
charley enters through the front door
having your final meal
doug bob and woody dont
where are buck and earl
bucks ear is giving him some equilibrium problems
wild hogs writers first draft
earl enters holding the door open for buck who walks through slowly
just keep your eyes forward and head up
buck walks a few more steps then starts to tilt left
he quickly loses his balance and falls sideways taking out a card table full of food and the old man sitting at it
earl helps buck up and they join the guys at their table
having your final meal
buck and earl laugh
nobody else does
sternly to buck and earl thats out of line guys
buck looks around the table
hey isnt one of you missing
yeah dudleys with maggie somewhere
maggie comes out of the kitchen and approaches the table
hes with you isnt he
i thought he went to find you guys
doug shares a worried glance with bob and woody
wild hogs writers first draft
charley can i borrow your phone
charley hands it to him and doug starts to dial
dudley has mine
ill just call him
he has a phone
what happened to freedom
he needed to call his answering machine so his cat could hear his voice
here we go
he probably snuck off somewhere to buy you some romantic gift or something
no big deal
hes never had a girlfriend so hes probably getting carried away
he once drank eighteen mocha lattes because the starbucks clerk was smiling at him
i remember that
his pee turned brown and he started crying
and the girl wasnt even smiling she just had a cleft lip
jack stands next to dudley who is duct taped to a chair with so much tape that it looks like hes in a cocoon
only his head is uncovered
jack holds dudleys cellphone
try again asshole
wild hogs writers first draft
knowingly to group nope
the hells angels have him
doug gives a look to the other guys
they mouth shit damn right the hells angels
your friend paid us a little visit
and now hes hurting reeeeal bad
no i actually feel pretty jack kicks dudleys chair with his foot
it tips over and lands on its side with dudley in it
dudley looks out at the floor helpless
hey a peanut
dudley tries to stick his tongue out to get the peanut
jack notices and kicks it away
so heres what were going to do now
you guys are going to pay us a visit
and youre going to bring a disobedience fee of ten thousand dollars
and dont even think about calling any cops
just you guys and ten grand
and if you dont show up in an hour well then well just take the fine out of your friends legs
which were going to break with a tire iron
yelling to phone dont bring the money guys
wild hogs writers first draft
im a computer programmer
i dont need my legs
jack considers this and turns back to the phone
well break his hands
yelling to phone bring the money
doug shakes his head at dudleys stupidity
well bring the money
just dont touch our friend
oh i wont touch him if you bring that money
but if you dont ill be touching him all night long
and ill be enjoying it
the other bikers suddenly stifle laughter
there was nothing wrong with that one
that was tough
those guys are afraid of me now
they know how much i want em
the gang laughs again
the gang stops laughing off jacks warning glare
dudley looks up from the floor
hey can we call my cat now
she needs to hear my voice
wild hogs writers first draft
jack looks down at dudley then to the other bikers
get me more duct tape
a biker nods and grabs another role of duct tape
he heads over to dudley
doug sits in a chair deep in thought
bob woody earl buck and bud stand with other members of the town
maggie is on a couch sobbing into her hands
he went there to save everybody and now theyre going to break his hands
no they arent
were going to get him back
we sure are
im going to call the highway patrol
theyll be there in no way
they said no law
we cant risk them doing anything to dudley
we can call the highway patrol after we get dud back but we shouldnt piss these guys off while hes still in their hands
im going to call karen and have the cash wired out of our savings
this is my fault
all this is my fault
i have some money in my severance package
were using it
wild hogs writers first draft
wait he did this because of me
i have a thousand dollars in tip money i want to put in
i have a couple thousand in the diner emergency fund ill put in too
doug who has been thinking all this over stands up from his chair
nobody is paying anything
everyone stops and gives doug a puzzled look
he has a new fire behind his eyes
his suburban quietude has transformed into something more
were not calling the highway patrol
were not gathering ten thousand dollars
were going over there and getting our friend back
i dont think thats the safest plan
but sometimes you have to do the things that arent safe to create a world that youre happy being in
these hells angels dont want our ten thousand dollars
they want our dignity
they want us to be afraid of them just like this town is
and once they know were afraid they can do whatever they want
thats how these guys exist
thats how they ride into this town and tear it to pieces
because people want to keep their lives safe so badly they give up the best part about it
doug takes his wild hogs jacket and pulls it on
doug looks at woody and bob
woody smiles and pulls on his jacket
wild hogs writers first draft
and the friends
woody steps over to doug
bob looks at them for a moment then finally smiles and pulls on his jacket
lets go slap the bull
doug smiles and taps fists with bob and woody
doug bob and woody walk along main street shoulder to shoulder
they look to each other with a smile
even though theyre walking into the mouth of the beast theyre finally who they were in college again
they approach the diner and stand out on the street like gunslingers in the old west calling their enemy out of the saloon
the front door of the bar opens and the hells angels swagger out
after a moment the gang parts and jack steps out in front of them
the wild hogs
im glad to see youre finally showing us a little respect
jack turns back and nods at one of the hells angels
they push dudley forward
we see he is now completely cocooned in duct tape like a mummy
there is only a small slit for his mouth and eyes
muffled from tape hey guyth
doug shakes his head
just hold tight dudley
wild hogs writers first draft
dudley tries to nod but cant
he leans his torso back and forth to signal yes
hand him over
wheres the cash
doug looks to bob and woody
they nod encouragingly
doug gathers his courage and turns back to jack
were not giving you any money
jack looks surprised
were not going to play your games
were all adults here
its not highschool
im sorry your bar got burned down and well be glad to help you get it rebuilt but were done being bullied by you
now give us back dudley and get out of this town
the hells angels start to laugh
jack turns back to them and smiles can you believe these guys
doug is starting to lose his cool
yells to jack give us back our friend asshole
the hells angels are suddenly silent
jack turns back and looks at doug in disbelief then rage
doug starts to look a little worried
what did you just call me
losing some confidence ass
you know what
i was just going to pulverize your friend here
wild hogs writers first draft
but now im pissed off
youre all going to get hurt
hells angels style
the hells angles nod and pick up various weapons crowbars tire irons bats
they start moving towards doug woody and bob
bob looks to doug
i thought theyd back down
we can still outrun them
woody turns around to see hells angles have now closed in behind them blocking their escape
hear that guys
he called you all fat
to hells angels i meant full figured
the hells angels close to within a few feet of the wild hogs and raise their weapons to strike
wait a minute
the hells angels stop
you want to beat the shit out of us
but you outnumber us forty to three
you think theres honor in that
why dont we make it fair if you guys are so freaking tough
the leader of our gang against the leader of yours
hes twice as big as doug
me against you
but not just for dudley
if you win well give you ten grand and go back home
youll never see us again
if i win you let dudley go and you never set foot in lucas again
this town is off limits to the hells angels
wild hogs writers first draft
jack looks back to the hells angels who chuckle
this will be a quick fight
you in or are you too much of a bitch
the hells angels freeze
jack grits his teeth in rage and turns back to doug
lets party tough guy
doug nods trying to look confidant but its quickly fading away
doug and jack are standing in their corners opposite each other in the dirt parking lot
theyre surrounded by a circle of hells angels rowdily waiting for the fight to commence
woody and bob coach doug in his corner
just stay clear of the big punches
youve got more stamina than this guy
when do i hit back
just try and get him tired
i dont think punches will do much to him
doug gives woody a concerned look
jack steps into the circle and throws off his jacket
time for your beating yuppie
wild hogs writers first draft tell my wife i won then got hit by a truck
doug takes a deep breath and starts into the circle
lets do this doug doesnt even finish his sentence as jack lands a punch on the side of his head
doug is stunned as jack sends his other fist crashing into dougs forehead
doug goes flying backwards and falls down in the dirt
the hells angels cheer
jack high fives them as doug struggles back to his feet and looks back at woody and bob cradling his face
dammit jesus that hurt
it really hurts
jack comes back over to doug
jack throws another right but this time doug ducks still cradling his jaw
but doug is instantly punched in the stomach by jacks other fist
doug winces as he doubles over in agony
drool drips out of his mouth
this isnt pretty
jack takes him by the back of the shirt and lifts him into the air
the hells angels cheer as jack tosses doug five yards into the dirt
dont get tired yet
the hurt is just beginning
doug tries to stand back up but its getting harder
he slyly grabs a handful of sand as he starts to stand
doug whips around and throws the sand towards jacks face however his aim is off
the sand hits jack in the chest and falls away
jack looks at doug and shakes his head
wild hogs writers first draft
jack punches doug square in the face again
doug crumples to the ground in pain
jack turns back to the hells angels
man this isnt even a workout
jack laughs and puts his aviator sunglasses back on as doug quickly stands up and whips around at him
doug throws another handful of sand
this time he aims carefully but jack now has sunglasses on
the sand bounces harmlessly off the lenses
doug cringes and waits for the punch which comes like a freight train into his stomach
doug doubles over again as jack lines up another punch
this ones gonna break bone
wait doug straightens up and looks curiously at jacks mouth
your tooth thats an acute periodontal abscess
look i really hate you but i dont want to feel responsible for a death
im a dentist
i took an oath
same one as doctors
if the infection in that tooth gets to the root it could seep into your nervous system
just let me look doug slowly reaches towards jacks mouth
jack doesnt move
youre a dentist
wild hogs writers first draft
one of the best
and i know when your gums are that swollen and your and wham
doug punches jack square in the mouth
jack goes down hard
woody and bob cheer
start kicking him
dont let him get up
doug nods and goes to kick jack but jack grabs the foot and pushes him backwards
doug falls back to the dirt
jack stands up and dusts himself off
now youre going to die
jack approaches doug who closes his eyes and waits for the end
jack turns around as woody walks into the circle
dougs not the leader of this gang
i jack instantly punches woody in the face
woody falls down next to doug
doug turns his head to woody
theyre both bleeding from their noses and lips
jack looks at bob
anybody else the leader of this gang
bob takes a deep breath and bends down an grabs a long lead pipe
he starts towards jack
wild hogs writers first draft
alright mother f bob suddenly trips on the lead pipe and hits the ground
doug shakes his head
just stay down
well i guess thats all of you dudley still covered in tape comes running into the circle from the other side
dudley charges jack but his limited mobility results not in a tackle but in him leaning on jack
after a moment jack takes a step back and dudley falls to the ground
jack cracks his knuckles and looks to oilcan
give me the crowbar
oilcan nods and hands it to jack
jack smiles at the four fallen wild hogs
guess you guys are wishing youd listened now huh
jack smiles as we hear jack and the hells angels look up the road
angle on down street
charley is riding his shiny harley davidson police bike
behind him are buck and earl driving a police cruiser
behind the cruiser is a large group of people carrying rakes hedge clippers brooms
its all the citizens of lucas
angle on hells angels
wild hogs writers first draft
charley pulls up to the group and gets off his motorcycle
all right jack
thatll be enough of that
are you kidding
and what makes you think you can ride a motorcycle without our permission
ill ride whatever i want from now on
im the sheriff of lucas and im not tolerating any more lawlessness
bob helps doug woody and dudley to their feet as jack takes a step towards charley
id stop right there jack
earl and buck get out of the cruiser with two shotguns
they cock the guns and walk to charleys side
jack looks concerned
youre going to shoot us
not unless you want to do something stupid like ignoring buck grabs his missing ear as he starts to loose his balance
he tips over and falls
as he hits the ground the shotgun fires and hits oilcan in the leg
oilcan falls to the ground
he shot me
i just got shot
charley looks over at buck then back to jack
yeah i guess were going to shoot you
the hells angels suddenly look nervous and back up a few steps
charley steps towards jack
wild hogs writers first draft
were not going to live in fear of your gang anymore jack
if the wild hogs can stand up to you so can everyone of us
the crowd of townspeople gathers behind charley and nods
you mess up our town well do the same to you
the crowd cheers as thomas milborn the guy earl pointed out as a child molester steps forward
people like you are the scum of the earth
the crowd is silent for a moment then hesitantly gives a uncomfortable cheer
charley turns back to the hells angels
the point is from now on you need to treat lucas with kindness and respect
and when you do youll be treated the same
and if you dont
charley looks over at oilcan whos tending to the bullet wound in his thigh
then i guess well keep
jack looks at all the townspeople
he knows hes beaten
he nods bitterly
now id like you to untape our friend dudley
jack signals to one of the hells angels
he grabs dudleys tape and spins him around to untape him
after a painful minute dudley is untaped
charley looks at jacks jacket
wild hogs writers first draft
and i believe thats his jacket
jack begrudgingly takes off dudleys wild hogs jacket and tosses it to him
dudley proudly puts it on
and as i recall that panhead was traded to dudley
jack looks over at the mint condition motorcycle and shakes his head
he can have his sportster back
a deals a deal jack
jack grits his teeth and throws a set of keys at dudley
the crowd chatters in approval as dudley gets on the panhead and starts the engine
he revs it a few times and jack shoots doug an infuriated glare
hope youre happy
you suburban posers are a disease
you need to learn some damn respect for real bikers
you still dont get it do you jack
we are the real bikers
as doug says this dudley kicks the panhead into gear and shoots forward out of control
he instantly crashes into a steel light post
everyone in the crowd cringes as the bike falls over in a crumpled heap
up from the ground
yeah ill take the sportster back i guess
wild hogs writers first draft
jack just stares at the trashed motorcycle mortified
its later that afternoon in lucas
doug bob and woody walk to their motorcycles with charley earl and buck
well i wish you guys would stay longer
ahh we should be heading back
i think weve had enough excitement for one trip
earl steps forward and shakes dougs hand
you guys were a blessing to this place
im not going to get all emotional like hamburger head here always does
earl laughs and looks to his left
buck isnt there
he quickly looks to the right where buck is staring at him in disbelief
whatd you just call me
its just a little scar
im still better looking than you
buck goes to storm off but after a few steps tilts left and falls over
doug shakes his head then turns to woody and bob
to woody and bob you guys ready to head back
wild hogs writers first draft
woody takes a deep breath and shakes his head
you know what
i think im going to press on

i feel good about my life again
and id like to see what san franciscos all about
doug nods and looks to bob
you can tell he wants to go

lets ride to san suddenly a mini van pulls up
karen and kelly hop out
i told you i was coming bob
kelly kisses doug
he smiles glad to see her
what are you doing here
karen said you guys were in trouble
i kept calling your cell but somebody programmed it to not receive calls from our house
doug shoots woody a look
woody hurries over to his bike
karen turns to bob
wild hogs writers first draft

he cant take it anymore
karen stops talking shocked by bob raising his voice
listen to me
this is my vacation and if i want to ride on with my friends well thats what im going to do
and if you have a problem with that well
theres a moment of silence as karen absorbs this
the guys all look at bob proudly
after a few seconds karens face softens
karen shyly kisses bob on the cheek
bob cant believe it
i love you
bob smiles at her and gets on his bike
angle on doug and kelly
kelly looks at doug

wild hogs writers first draft
i even got beaten up
doug winks cockily
kelly lights up

doug smiles and gets onto his motorcycle
kelly looks concerned

doug shrugs like he hasnt a care in the world
we can risk it
kelly smiles and kisses him proudly
doug grabs her face and kisses her back
then turns to woody and bob
i think so
what do you think
the camera pulls out to reveal dudley sitting on his motorcycle
next to him is maggie sitting in the rusty sidecar now attached to dudleys bike
shes wearing dudleys goggles and nods to him encouragingly
dudley looks back over to doug bob and woody
they start their motorcycles
the engines roar to life
the four motorcycles and one sidecar cruise down the open highway
the guys smile as the wind blows in their faces
wild hogs writers first draft
its freedom joy and friendship all wrapped up in one expression
the camera pans around them and finally zooms in on doug
we see his eyes sparkle a little bit and he opens his mouth i walk these streets a loaded six string on my back
i play for keeps cause i might not make it back
im a cowboy on a steel horse i ride
the other guys smile and join in dead or alive
they all look at each other as they continue to sing over the roar of the engines ohh im a cowboy i got the night on my side
wante ee ed

the camera slowly pulls out to an aerial shot as the guys joyfully ride along the sunlit highway
its a good day to be a wild hog
