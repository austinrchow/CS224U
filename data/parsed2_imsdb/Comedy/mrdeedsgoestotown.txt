written by robert previous hit riskin based on a story by clarence budington kelland
quick shots of a car speeding around curves in a mountainous region
the car jumps a bridge hurtles into space crashes in a fireball
followed by newsboys hawking special editions people on streetcorners buying and reading newspapers with a succession of banner headlines and finally semple heir as yet unknown of mac the editor
at his desk barking into the telephone
say listen corny who do you think youre talking to
if the semple attorneys dont know who the heir is who does
listens aw come on corny ive done you a lot of favors
what do you say whos getting the semple dough
of cornelius cobb a hardened ex newspaperman customarily impatient grouchy and nervous victim of the new york tempo
his friends call him corny
on the phone youre asking the wrong guy mac
im only a press agent
a plush law office leather chairs and shelves of books
arthur cedar attorney briskly enters scene and seats himself at his desk
cedar is in the neighborhood of fifty grey templed dignified sharp
cobb is using the phone on his desk
cedar glances at him
covering mouthpiece confidentially wants to know who the heir is
firmly hang up
returning to the phone sorry mac i cant
sure but i aint the attorney
more firmly hang up
another attorney at one end of the desk reviewing a pile of papers
cedar is and i havent seen him in two days
hangs up the phone listen cedar weve got to do something about the newspapers
barely glancing up im not interested in the newspapers
but its a great story
somewhere in this country a guy is walking into twenty million bucks
yes i know
my first concern is to locate the lucky man
when i do its your job to keep the newspapers away from him
resignedly its okay with me as long as my weekly stipend keeps coming in
as two men rush in with a flurry of excitement
one of them is anderson an obsequious employee of cedars
with him is another lawyer one of the cedar brothers
we located him mr
we found out where he is
yes john we got him
heres the report longfellow deeds single lives in mandrake falls vermont
glancing at the report thank heaven
better wire him right away john
ill do no such thing
im going there myself
youre going with me too anderson and you too cobb
he pushes a button on the intercom
make three reservations on the first train out to mandrake falls vermont
begins to spell as scene fades it is a pleasantly rural scene with just a handful of local characters scattered about
at one end of the platform some mail newspapers and a few pieces of freight are being loaded
cedar cobb and anderson stand in front of a welcome sign
the three obviously are out of their element here obviously city folks
over their shoulders
we hear cobbs voice as he reads welcome to mandrake falls where the scenery enthralls where no hardship eer befalls welcome to mandrake falls
cobb and cedar exchange glances
are you sure this is the town he lives in
yes sir mr
this is the town all right
well i dropped everything at the office i hope its not a wild goose chase
we checked it thoroughly
he lives here all right
i spy a native
lets ask him
camera moves with them as they cross to a small one story old brick building covered with ivy
this is the ticket and freight office combined
in front of it is a very old man a stoop
shouldered rail agent with a face of a million wrinkles puttering around some packages
as they approach good morning
glances up morning neighbors
he picks up a package and disappears into the building
cedar and cobb look at each other
thats an excellent start
at least weve broken the ice
the old man returns to his pile of packages
i say my friend do you know a fellow by the name of longfellow deeds
everyone knows deeds
yes i he again disappears
must be a game hes playing
the old man shows up again
wed like to get in touch with him
its very important
who do you think im talking about
oh yes deeds
you wont have no trouble at all
talk to anybody
whereupon the old man carries another package inside
cobb is properly exasperated now
i guess wed better try somebody else
no we wont
the next time that jumping jack comes out ill straddle him while you ask him your questions
the old man emerges from the building and looks up at them as if hes never seen them before
cobb grabs the old man as he turns to head back into the building
were the fellows who were here a minute ago
i never forget a face
he turns again but cobb holds him by the arm and sets him down on a small packing case
listen pop weve come all the way from new york to look up a fellow by the name of deeds
its important very important
releasing his arm you dont have to get rough neighbor
all you got to do is ask
then please pretend for just one fleeting moment that im asking
where does he reside
cobb turns away in disgust
anderson steps forward
longfellow deeds where does he live
oh thats what you want
well why didnt you say so in the first place instead of beating around the bush
those other fellows dont know what theyre talking about
as he exits scene come on ill take you there in my car
if theyd only explained to me what they wanted there would be no trouble
he leaves cobb and cedar staring after him killingly
a little old lady mrs
meredith answers a knock at the door
cedar cobb and anderson stand there with the old man at their heels
meredith is a sweet soft voiced timid and fluttery little creature
oh will you come in please gentlemen
no hes over to the park arranging for the bazaar sos to raise money for the fire engine
to old man mal you shoulda knowed he was in the park
knew it all the time
but these men said they wanted to see the house
mumbling as he exits cant read their minds if they dont say what they want
cobb glares after him exasperatedly
meredith turns to cobb and cedar
come in please
can i get you a cup of tea
sure i couldnt get you a glass of lemonade or something
thats very kind of you
are you related to him
no im his housekeeper
well wed like to find out something about him
what does he do for a living
he and jim mason own the tallow works
but thats not where he makes his money
he makes most of it from his poetry
skeptically he writes poetry
oh my goodness yes
he writes all those things on postcards
you know for christmas and easter and birthdays
sit down please
she reaches over to a desk and picks one up
heres one he got for this one
as she reads with feeling when youve nowhere to turn and youre filled with doubt dont stand in midstream hesitating for you know that your mothers heart cries out im
waiting my boy im waiting
she looks up isnt that beautiful
his eyes open unbelievingly
isnt it a lovely sentiment
a dog enters racing toward the door scratching at it and whining
as she heads toward the door here he is now
she opens the door and goes out with the dog racing ahead
to cedar sotto voce i suggest you break it to him gently
hes liable to keel over from the shock
meredith re appears
we hear her voice as she comes through the doorway
theyve been waiting a long while
longfellow deeds trails behind her
who are they
i dont know
standing formally mr
how do you do
shaking hands how do you do
extending card im john cedar of the new york firm of cedar cedar cedar and budington
he watches longfellow who is glancing at the card
reads to himself cedar cedar cedar and budington
looks up smiles budington must feel like an awful stranger hmm
cobbs eyes pop at the nifty
cornelius cobb and mr
they exchange greetings
longfellow gestures to chairs
you gentlemen make yourselves comfortable
longfellow crosses to his tuba near a chair
he takes a mouthpiece out of his pocket
been waiting two weeks for this
kids keep swiping them all the time
they use em for bean shooters
he blows a note what can i do for you gentlemen
you gentlemen going to stay for lunch
right to the point ignoring her id like to ask you a few questions
longfellow looks at them strangely and sits down beside his tuba
deeds are you the son of dr
joseph and mary deeds
are your parents living
deeds does the name of martin w
semple mean anything to you
hes an uncle of mine i think
i never saw him but my mothers name was semple you know
well he passed on
he was killed in a motor accident in italy
gee thats too bad
if theres anything i can do to while he speaks he has been adjusting the tuba between his legs and now sucks on the mouthpiece preparatory to playing
i have good news for you sir
semple left a large fortune when he died
he left it all to you mr
deducting the taxes it amounts to something in the neighborhood of
his lips are over the mouthpiece of the tuba
his only reaction to the startling news is to lift his eyes in cedars direction
how about lunch
are the gentlemen going to stay or not
of course theyre going to stay
to the gentlemen shes got some fresh orange layer cake
you know with the thick stuff on the top
meredith sure they dont want to go to the hotel
cobb and cedar have watched this by play open mouthed and are now even more astounded to see longfellow blow into his tuba
over the noise of the tuba perhaps you didnt hear what i said mr
the whole semple fortune goes to you
oh yes i heard you all right
thats quite a lot isnt it
oh itll do in a pinch
impressed yes indeed
i wonder why he left me all that money
i dont need it
he resumes his oom pahs
the three men sit around a table having lunch
by longfellows side is as expected the tuba
cobb here is an ex newspaperman associated with your uncle for many years as a sort of buffer
a glorified doormat
you see rich people need someone to keep the crowds away
the worlds full of pests
then theres the newspapers to handle
one must know when to seek publicity and when to avoid it
during cedars speech longfellow seems to have been lost in his own thoughts
cedar cedar cedar and budington
funny i cant think of a rhyme for budington
why should you
well whenever i run across a funny name i always like to poke around for a rhyme
ive got one for cobb there once was a man named cobb who kept semple away from the mob
came the turn of the tide and semple he died and now poor cobbs out of a job
sounds like a two weeks notice to me
ive gotten the sackaroo in many ways but never in rhyme
oh i dont mean that
im sure im going to need your help
oh thats different if its just poetry
meredith enters with coffee which she pours
are you a married man mr
no hes too fussy for that
thats whats the matter with him
there are lots of nice girls right here in mandrake falls whore dying to be married dont pay any attention to her
hes got a lot of foolish notions about saving a lady in distress
now you keep out of this
diplomatically saving a lady in distress eh
well i suppose we all have dreams like that when we are young
rising incidentally wed better get started
youll have to pack
youre going to new york with us
this afternoon at four oclock
i dont think weve got any suitcases
well we could borrow a couple from mrs
you know she went to niagara falls last year
im kind of nervous
ive never been away from mandrake falls in my life
kind of like to see grants tomb though
all business i can understand that
rises to go well take a walk around town meet you at the train at four oclock
shakes his hand congratulations mr
youre one of the richest men in the country
well see you later
meredith goodbye and thank you
see you later kid
as he too exits good day sir
hear what he said
you know how much twenty million is
i dont care how much it is
you sit right there and eat your lunch
you havent touched a thing
longfellow nibbles at some food staring into space thoughtfully
the whole town is out
the band is playing hes a jolly good fellow the crowd sings
its a festive occasion
a large awkwardly painted sign looms over everyones head
it reads they peer anxiously around looking for someone when cobb dashes in
breathlessly i cant find him
i looked everywhere
i even went to his house
its locked up
he probably had a change of heart
he wasnt very anxious to come in the first place
looking on here comes the train
cedar glances off
of train approaching
the band has already begun and is now in the midst of for hes a jolly good fellow
at this moment as he looks off a startled expression comes into cobbs eyes
he grabs cedar by the arm who glances in the direction he points
that tuba player
with longfellow in his customary position blowing on his tuba
cedar and cobb stare wide eyed as the song is finished
well now ive seen everything
in the b
is the train with longfellow standing on the observation platform clutching his tuba
on either side of him is cedar and cobb
in the f
the crowd yells its farewell
several of them stuff baskets of fruit into his hands
the band plays auld lang syne
over longfellow and cobbs shoulders
as the train begins pulling out
longfellow smiles wanly and waves
a pause gosh ive got a lot of friends
cobb looks up into longfellows face affected by the scene
longfellow is slumped in his seat his legs sprawled out his eyes ceilingward in deep thought
cobb sits across from him
cedar enters hangs up his coat hat and cane
opening a snifter generously have a drink
distractedly no thanks
cobb and cedar exchange a look
will you have a cigar
no thank you
cedar sits down
breaking the silence i wouldnt worry if i were you
of course a large fortune like this entails a great responsibility but youll have a good deal of help
so dont worry
leave everything to me
oh i wasnt worried about that
i was wondering where theyre going to get another tuba player for the band
cobb has just finished taking a drink and cant help but nearly spit it out
the th century crossing the harlem river
of the th century going under the street level on park avenue
upon which we read cedar cedar back to take in cedar who opens the door and walks through
with cedar as he strides across the room in business like fashion
he comes to a door marked private offices
he pushes this door opens and disappears
as cedar passes by hello john
where have you been
as he walks briskly ive been fishing
in the background is typical office hub bub
to a secretary as he passes good morning celia
good morning mr
a chorus of good morning mr
issues from the clerks
a secretary looks up
with cedar as he passes through the room arriving at a door marked john cedar private
he goes through the door
cedar breezes in and speaks to a secretary
where are they
waiting for you in the other office
he strides across the room to still another door marked private and he disappears
a group of associates sit around in large leather chairs as cedar barges in
beaming good morning
the men come to life
some rise others lean forward
two of them are brothers of cedar tall and athletic
the third is a small frightened looking man
he is budington
ad lib hello john
well whats he like
weve got nothing to worry about
hes as naive as a child
john close that door
into dictograph will you get mrs
cedar on the phone please
come on john
to associates the smartest thing i ever did was to make that trip
anxiously john did you get the uh
interrupting no budington i didnt get the power of attorney
but dont worry i will
beaming to his brothers i asked him last night what he was going to do with the money and what do you suppose he said
gathering around him what
i cant imagine
he said he guessed hed give it away
laughing give it away
the boy must be a nit wit
budington hasnt enjoyed the joke his mind still on their problem
well john you had the right hunch
john if you dont mind my saying so we cant afford to irascibly i know budington
we cant afford to have the books investigated right now
you must have said that a thousand times already
but what if they fall into somebody elses hands why uh well it hasnt happened yet has it
wailing but a half million dollars
my goodness where are we going to get exploding will you stop worrying
it was i who got old man semple to turn everything over to us wasnt it
and who got the power of attorney from him
all right and ill get it again
pause change of tone ill take it easy
those booksll never leave this office
george semple a neer do well prominent for the pouches under his eyes and a perpetual nose twitch is sprawled out in a chair reading a newspaper
a nagging wife walks around him
nothing but a yokel
your uncle must have been mad to leave all that money to him
youre as closely related to him as he is and what did you get
she storms around the room
george merely twitches his nose but says nothing
slaps the paper george is reading i say what did you get
can i help it if my uncle didnt like me
i told you to be nice to him
ten years weve been waiting for that old man to kick off
and then we were going to be on easy street
yeah on easy street
oh shut up
its too late now and youre a nuisance
thats just what im going to be a nuisance
im going to be a nuisance until i get hold of some of that money
the editor stands in front of his desk
four of five reporters in front of him several photographers
in the b
leaning against the wall near the door apparently indifferent is babe bennett
the editor mac is haranguing them
as he blows his nose hes news
every time he blows his nose its news
a corn fed bohunk like that falling into the semple fortune is hot copy
but its got to be personal
its got to have an angle
what does he think about
how does it feel to be a millionaire
is he going to get married
what does he think of new york
is he smart
is he dumb
a million angles
she has a string in her hand which she keeps flicking trying to get a knot into it in the manner of cowboys with a rope
macs voice continues over scene
of them all as mac continues hes been here three days and what have you numbskulls brought in
any halfwit novice could have done better
yeah we tried too am i talking too loud
or annoying anybody
you know corny cobb
hes keeping him under lock and key
never mind about cobb
use what little brains youve got
find out something yourselves you imbecilic stupes
now get out of here before i really tell you what i think of you
come on get out
they scramble to their feet
one of the reporters mumbles something as he passes mac on the way to the door
alert what was that
thinking fast covering up huh
i said you had dirty plaster
as babe is still flicking her string trying to get a knot
the reporters file past her on their way out
just as the last one is approaching she succeeds in doing the trick
as mac turns to babe
thought i could depend on you but youre getting as bad as the rest of them
he grabs up a handful of papers and starts out
flicking the string look i can do it
whats gotten into you babe
i remember the time when youd blast this town wide open before youd let cobb get away with a thing like this
oh hes not getting away with anything
excited listen babe get me some stuff on this guy and you can have can i have a months vacation
casually as she starts away leave four columns open on the front page tomorrow
as babe crosses to door
now youre talking babe
ill keep the whole front page open
what are you going to do
at door have lunch
macs face lights up happily
of a large imposing looking residence
longfellow stands awkwardly between two tailors who chalk and pin a suit on him
after a few seconds of silence its the first time i ever had a suit made on purpose
the tailors smile accommodatingly as camera pulls back and we discover that both cedar and cobb are present
cobb is slumped in a chair and cedar is carefully putting some papers away in a portfolio
its merely a suggestion
i dont wish to press the point mr
deeds but if youll give me your power of attorney well take care of everything
itll save you a lot of petty annoyances
every shark in town will be trying to sell you something
oh yes thereve been a lot of them around here already
strangest kind of people
salesmen politicians moochers all want something
i havent had a minute to myself
havent seen grants tomb yet
well you see your uncle didnt bother with that sort of thing
he left everything to us
he traveled most of the time and enjoyed himself
you should do the same thing mr
besides wanting to be my lawyer you also want to handle my investments too
that is to say well outside of your regular fee how much extra will it cost
too quickly oh nothing
no extra charge
that involves a lot of extra work doesnt it
generously yes but thats an added service a firm like cedar cedar cedar and budington usually donates
funny i cant think of a rhyme for budington yet
as a butler stands in the doorway
the gentlemen from the opera are still waiting in the board room sir
theyre getting a trifle impatient sir
i forgot all about them
to cobb what do you think they want
well your uncle was chairman of the board of directors
they probably expect you to carry on
rising ill tell those mugs to keep their shirts on that youll be right down
thanks suddenly oh did you send that telegram to jim mason
no i didnt send it
ive got it written out though
here it is
reaches into his pocket and reads arthurs been with the tallow works too long
dont think we should fire him
send it right away
i dont want him to fire arthur
we dont want to fire arthur
he was the last baby my father delivered arthur was
i think you ought to give this matter some thought mr
i mean about the power of attorney
yes i will
cobb has stalled long enough to hear longfellows decision before he goes out of the room
ill give it a lot of thought
there was a fellow named winslow here a little while ago wanted to handle my affairs for nothing too
it puzzles me why these people all want to work for nothing
it isnt natural
so i guess id better think about it some more
longfellow cedar and the two tailors
you go to an awful lot of work to keep a fellow warm dont you
a butler enters again
hallor to see you sir
quickly did you say hallor
well dont let him in
who is he
a lawyer representing some woman with a claim against the estate
to butler tell him to see me at my office
well if he has a claim wed better see him
to butler send him in
the butler disappears
hes capable of causing you a lot of trouble mr
how can he make any trouble for me
i havent done anything
the butler reappears followed by hallor
the minute he appears cedar speaks up belligerently
i thought i told you to take up this matter with me hallor
im a little tired of being pushed around by you mr
cedar i dont care how important you are
to longfellow mr
deeds i represent mrs
eyebrows raised mrs
your uncles common law wife
she has a legal claim on the estate
well let the courts decide what her legal position is
you wouldnt dare go into court with a case like this and you know it
he turns to longfellow who has listened to them studyingly
i leave it to you mr
can you conceive of any court not being in sympathy with any woman who gave up the best years of her life for an old man like your uncle
what kind of wife did you say she was
common law wife
on top of that theres a child
the poor woman should be taken care of immediately
pleased im glad to see youre willing to be reasonable mr
if she was his wife she should have all the money
thats only fair
i dont want a penny of it
he yanks his trousers off and hands them to the tailor
dont make any rash promises as the tailors exit cobb returns
youd better get right down there
that opera mob is about to break into the mad song from lucia
to hallor oh i dont want to keep them waiting any longer
theyre important people
to cobb i wish youd go along with me cobb
theyre all strangers to me
well what about it mr
getting into robe to hallor youll excuse me wont you
ill be right back
he exits with cobb
as longfellow and cobb come out and start down corridor
gee im busy
did the opera people always come here for their meetings
why is that
wisely why do mice go where theres cheese
a group of eight distinguished looking men sit around a long table awaiting longfellows arrival
at the head of the table is a mr
from what im led to believe the young mans quite childish
i dont think well have any difficulty in getting him to put up the entire amount
after all its only a matter of
a drop in the bucket for him
an excellent idea
slyly you know gentlemen were really very fortunate the young man is so sympathetic toward music
winking he plays the tuba in the town band
who has been watching at door here he comes
there is a shuffle of preparation
with longfellow and cobb present
longfellow looks around completely awed
now gentlemen the first order of business will be the election of a new chairman of the board
rising as a sentimental gesture toward the best friend opera ever had the late mr
semple i think it only fitting that his nephew mr
longfellow deeds should be made our next chairman
i therefore nominate him
all those in favor
rises my congratulations mr
self consciously im chairman
humoring a child oh yes of course youve just been elected
to cobb im chairman
dryly happy voyage
right here mr
as longfellow is led to the presidents chair
douglas sits next to him
now the next order of business is the reading of the secretarys minutes
move we dispense with it
all in favor
longfellow looks his surprise
i think they can be dispensed with
were ready now for the reading of the treasurers report
move we dispense with it
all in favor
now gentlemen the next business will be featuring longfellow as he interrupts wait a minute
what does the chairman do
why the chairman presides at the meetings
thats what i thought
if you dont mind im rather interested in the treasurers report
id like to hear it
there is an uncomfortable shuffle
for a few minutes no one speaks
from the rear a tall man rises
the treasurer reports a deficit of for the current year
he is stunned
you mean weve lost that much
to include all at table
you see mr
deeds the opera is not conducted for profit
what is it conducted for
why its an artistic institution we own an opera house dont we
and we give shows
we provide opera
but you charge
i mean you sell tickets
and it doesnt pay
the opera has never paid
conclusively well then we must give the wrong kind of shows
the directors are stumped
featuring douglas and longfellow
the wrong kind
there isnt any wrong or right kind
opera is opera
i guess it is
but i personally wouldnt care to be head of a business that kept losing money
that wouldnt be common sense
incidentally where is the coming from
well we were rather expecting it to come from you
excuse me gentlemen theres nothing natural about that
he is suddenly startled
his ears prick up
they all stare at longfellow
over scene comes the low wailing cry of a siren which increases in volume as it gets closer to the building
longfellow jumps up
hey a fire engine
he rushes to the window and peers out
the others stare unbelievably
the shriek of the siren finally dies down
longfellow turns back
admiringly gee that was a pip
as he goes back to his seat we expect were going to have one like that in mandrake falls pretty soon with a siren too
there is a pause while he gets seated
now where were we
you see mr
deeds the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business
because it just isnt a business thats all
well maybe it isnt to you but it certainly is a business to me if i have to make up a loss of
if its losing that much money there must be something wrong
maybe you charge too much
maybe youre selling bad merchandise
maybe lots of things
i dont know
you see i expect to do a lot of good with that money
and i cant afford to put it into anything that i dont look into
thats my decision for the time being gentlemen
goodbye and thank you for making me chairman
he exits followed by cobb whose eyes shriek his admiration
the directors watch them leave flabbergasted
cobbs head reappears in doorway
gentlemen youll find the smelling salts in the medicine chest
the board of directors stare in dumb stupefaction at the door
as longfellow enters
hallor and cedar rise
sorry to keep you waiting so long
those opera people are funny
they wanted me to put up
what about it mr
why i turned them down naturally
no i mean about my client
oh well have to do something about the common wife
longfellows valet walter enters and holds up a full dress suit
tails tonight sir
turns and sees it why thats a monkey suit
do you want people to laugh at me
i never wore one of those things in my life
the tailors are leaving
shaking hands with longfellow goodbye and thank you sir
turning to the others wants me to wear a monkey suit
cedar and hallor smile accommodatingly
walter hands him a pair of trousers
as longfellow starts getting into the trousers
of course we dont want to appear greedy mr
i say we dont want to appear greedy
walter has gotten down on his knees and holds the ends of the pants
what do you think youre doing
why im assisting you sir
get up from there
i dont want anybody holding the ends of my pants
get up from there
rising yes sir
to others imagine that holding the ends of my pants
hallor smiles feebly his impatience growing
semple is entitled by law to one third of the estate
to walter and dont ever get down on your knees again understand
to hallor excuse me
what did you say
semple is entitled to one third of the estate
thats about isnt it
quietly well we didnt expect that much
im sure i can get her to settle quietly for one million
if theres any talk of settlement hallor take it up with me at the office
ill do no such thing thats right
dont you go to his office
theres only one place youre going and thats out the door
hallor looks up surprised
youre making a mistake mr
oh no im not
i dont like your face
besides theres something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million
im surprised that mr
cedar whos supposed to be a smart man couldnt see through that
now wait a minute buddy longfellow crosses to bell cord and pulls it
theres one nice thing about being rich you ring a bell and things happen
when the servant comes in mr
hallor im going to ask him to show you to the door
many people dont know where it is
no use in getting tough
thatll get you nowhere mr
strongly you know weve got letters
as a butler enters longfellow turns to him
will you show mr
hallor to the front door
as hallor gets to it
longfellow grabs him by the shirt front and half lifts him off the floor
and listen there isnt any wife there arent any letters and i think youre a crook
so you better watch your step
he shoves hallor violently and he stumbles out of scene
cobb enters to longfellow his hand extended
i cant hold out on you any longer
lamb bites wolf
shakes his head beautiful
only common sense
cedar has been most uncomfortable through the scene but now suavely assumes an admiring attitude
a forced smile i cant hold out any longer either mr
holds out his hand being an attorney for you will be a very simple affair
youre not my attorney yet mr
not till i find out whats on your mind
suppose you get the books straightened out quick so i can have a look at them
yes of course if you wish
but you must be prepared
this sort of thing will be daily routine
picks up his hat if it becomes annoying you let me know
longfellow shakes his hand
longfellow stares after him disgustedly wiping his hands with his handkerchief
even his hands are oily
walter has entered and holds up a coat for longfellow
well how about tonight
what would you like in the way of entertainment
your uncle had a weakness for dark ones tall and stately
how would you like yours
dark or fair tall or short fat or thin tough or tender
whatre you talking about
ever heard of em
name your poison and ill supply it
some other time cobb
some other time
okay youre the boss
as he goes when your blood begins to boil yell out
ill be seeing you
as cobb exits
longfellow turns to walter the valet
he talks about women as if they were cattle
every man to his taste sir
tell me walter are all those stories i hear about my uncle true
well sir he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time
what did he do with them
that was something i was never able to find out sir
longfellow exiting his bedroom wearing a coat and hat
he comes to the top of a grand staircase looks around slyly and sees that no one is watching
he slides down the bannister and touches the statue at the bottom for good luck
he starts for the door
when he gets there he finds his way barred by two husky looking mugs
he looks up surprised
hey you going out
isnt that all right
dont ever want to go out without telling us
who are you
were your bodyguards
cobb said stick to your tail no matter what
thats very nice of mr
cobb but i dont want anybody sticking to my tail no matter what
orders is orders
is that so
we gotta get you up in the morning and we gotta put you to bed at night
only its all right
no matter what we see we dont see nuttin see
smiling thats going to be fun
some people like it
longfellow glances around the room thoughtfully then continues uh will you do something for me before we go out
the first bodyguard eagerly takes out a pistol
the second bodyguard slaps it away
to first bodyguard put that away slug
to longfellow at your service
i got a trunk in that room
will you get it out for me
the two bodyguards accommodatingly enter a closet
the moment they are gone longfellow closes the door calmly and turns the key
ad lib hey hey
were your bodyguards
you cant do this
longfellow whistles as he exits
longfellow comes out glances over the horizon
the air is filled with a slight drizzle and he sighs happily
babe and two photographers bob and frank are huddled conspiratorially in the back seat of a taxi cab
pointing there he is
yep thats him
get the cameras ready and follow me
what are you going to do
follow me and grab whatever you can get
i suppose its going to be the same old thing
i tell you that dames nuts
longfellow is exiting front gate
from his angle
out of the shadows a girl comes into view and staggers forward
she reaches a tree and clutches it weakly
then her strength failing she crumples to the ground
longfellows eyes widen in apprehension as he starts forward camera following him
he reaches the girl and bending down lifts her head
we see it is babe bennett
her eyes are closed apparently in a dead faint
longfellow studies her face for a moment then starts to lift her
as he does so her eyes open and she looks up at him feigning bewilderment
feebly oh did i
she struggles to get to her feet
longfellow tries to assist her
can i help you
no thank you
ill be all right
look this is my house
id like to oh no really ill be all right
well i guess i walked too much
ive been looking for a job all day
i found one too
i start tomorrow
backing away youve been awfully kind
thank you very much
as she leaves him longfellow watches her full of sympathy
she takes a few steps and again feigning weakness falls against the iron fence clutching it
longfellow rushes to her assistance
looking around hey taxi
to driver hey stupe
follow that cab they just got into will you
step on it
come on come on
a corner table surrounded by ferns at which longfellow and babe sit
shes still eating
feel better now
mmm it tastes so good
deeds i dont know how i can ever thank you
tell me more about yourself
well i guess ive told you almost everything there is to tell
my folks live in a small town near hartford
im down here alone trying to make a living
hanging her head oh im really just a nobody
longfellow spots a strolling violinist
he furtively beckons the fellow over
the musician leans into them with romantic strains
as the musician finishes and strolls away oh that was so lovely
you were a lady in distress werent you
looks up what
oh uh nothing
as a waiter enters the scene and begins removing dishes
has anybody come in yet
be sure and point em out to me wont you
im a writer myself you know
the waiter throws longfellow a sidelong glance of complete boredom
i write poetry
youve been having quite an exciting time here havent you
all those meetings and business deals and society people havent you been having fun
that is i didnt pause while he looks at her until i met you
i like talking to you though moodily imagine my finding you right on my doorstep
the waiter enters again
brookfield just came in
oh the poet
over at that big round table
the one that looks like a poodle
longfellow stares off scene his eyes full of worship
to babe look theres brookfield the poet
looks also really
from their angle to show people at a table engaged in conversation
at longfellows table
he stares off at them awed
babe watches his face
a group of five men drinking as the waiter enters
confidentially indicating longfellow pardon
longfellow deeds who just inherited the semple fortune wants to meet you
i read about him
he writes poetry on postcards
lets invite him over
might get a couple of laughs
getting rather dull around here
its always dull here
rising ill get him
at which they are all seated now
babe sits next to longfellow who is the center of attraction
brookfield is just finishing introductions
morrow bill this is mr
deeds and his fiancee from mandrake falls
ad lib how do
nice to meet you
nice of you to ask us to come and sit with you
back home we never get a chance to meet famous people
calling waiter waiter
a little service here
ad lib yes
deeds is a distinguished poet
a drink for mr
hes a poet
have a drink
no i dont want it thank you
why you must drink
all poets drink
tell us mr
how do you go about writing your poems
we craftsmen are very interested in one anothers methods
do you have to wait for an inspiration or do you just dash it off
self consciously well i dont know
morrow over there for instance just dashes them off
thats what my publishers have been complaining about
they all laugh superficially
babe glances up at longfellow to see if hes aware that he is being laughed at
but he apparently isnt
laughing feebly your readers dont complain mr
how about you mr
well i write mine on order
the people i work for just tell me what they want and then i go to work and write it
why thats true genius
have you any peculiar characteristics when you are creating
well i play the tuba
they all laugh
ive been playing the harmonica for forty years didnt do me a bit of good
you wouldnt have one in your pocket would you mr
they all laugh
no a postcard with one of your poems on it
longfellow is beginning to sense he is being kidded
his face sober no
you mean to tell me you dont carry a pocketful around with you
i was hoping youd autograph one for me
i was too
as they keep on
longfellow has his eyes levelled on each speaker in turn obviously cognizant of their ill concealed jibes
wait a minute boys
deeds would recite one for us
ad lib yes
thats a very good idea
nothing like a poet reciting his own stuff
how about a mothers day poem mr
give us one that wrings the great american heart
ad lib yes
babe has been watching longfellow interested
now when their voices die down and they wait expectantly he speaks quietly
deeply hurt i guess i get the idea
i guess i know why i was invited here
to make fun of me
ad lib oh come now
i wouldnt say that
look hes temperamental
levelling off at him yeah what if i am
what about it
henaberrys face sobers
simply its easy to make fun of somebody if you dont care how much you hurt em
to brookfield i think your poems are swell mr
brookfield but im disappointed in you
i know i must look funny to you but maybe if you went to mandrake falls youd look just as funny to us
only nobody would laugh at you and make you feel ridiculous cause that wouldnt be good manners
as he rises continuing i guess maybe it is comical to write poems for postcards but a lot of people think theyre good
anyway its the best i can do
so if youll excuse me well be leaving
i guess i found out that all famous people arent big people
the group watches him silently as he leaves the table accompanied by babe
for a moment they are nonplussed then they break into raucous laughter all but morrow
with longfellow and babe as they take several steps
then he abruptly stops
turning to them theres just one thing more
if it werent for miss dawson being here with me id probably bump your heads together
quickly oh i dont mind
longfellow stares at her for a moment
then i guess maybe i will
he starts back toward the table
protectively brookfield and henaberry rise from their chairs
but they are too late for longfellow clips brookfield on the chin first with his left fist and with his right catches henaberry on the jaw
the punches are almost simultaneous
the surprise attack catches the men off guard and they fall backward
a waiter rushes forward to escort longfellow and babe out
calling out manager
morrow who never budged from his chair and who has watched longfellow with great admiration now rises to catch up to him
an outcry eureka
as morrow catches up to longfellow and babe who are on their way out
the waiter is shooing people away
step aside step aside
morrow barges forward
longfellow and babe turn
obviously groggy with drink say fellow you neglected me and i feel very put out
points to his chin look sock it right there will you
lay one right on the button but sock it hard
thats all right
i got it off my chest
the difference between them and me is i know when ive been a skunk
you take me to the nearest news stand and ill eat a pack of your postcards raw
longfellow and babe smile
as morrow continues to speak he sways drunkenly and would fall over backwards a couple of times in midsentence if the alert longfellow didnt have a clutch on his collar
oh what a magnificent deflation of smugness
pal youve added ten years to my life
a poet with a straight left and a right hook delicious
youre my guest from now on forever and a day even unto eternity
thanks but miss dawson and i are going out to see the sights
swell you just showed me a sight lovely to behold and id like to reciprocate
listen you hop aboard my magic carpet longfellow catches him before he falls backward in his enthusiasm thanks and ill show you sights that youve never seen before
id kind of like to see grants tomb and the statue of liberty
well youll not only see those but before the evenings half through youll be leaning against the leaning tower of pisa youll mount mt
ill show you the pyramids and all the little pyramiddes leaping from sphinx to sphinx
pal how would you like to go on a real old fashioned binge
i mean the real mccoy
listen you play saloon with me and ill introduce you to every wit every nit wit and every half wit in new york
well go on a twister thatll make omar the soused philosopher of persia look like an anemic on a goats milk diet
longfellow saves him once again from crashing over
vaguely that ought to be fun
say listen ill take you on a bender that will live in your memory as a thing of beauty and joy forever
to someone off boy
he exits from the scene
camera following to the world in general oh tempora
he bumps into a woman who glares at him
oh youre drunk
unmindful oh youre right
to babe i guess if we go with him well see things huh
she looks up at his face amazed at his innocence
yes i guess we will
mac is reading the story eyes sparkling
babe is sprawled in a chair doing tricks with a coin
reads i play the tuba to help me think
this is one of the many startling statements made by longfellow deeds new yorks new cinderella man who went out last night to prove that his uncle the late m
semple from whom he inherited was a rank amateur in the art of standing the town on its cauliflower ear
he looks up
thats sensational babe
it took some high powered acting believe me
i was the worlds sweetest ingenue
is he really that big a sap
hes the original
there are no carbon copies of that one
babe you stuck a tag on that hick thatll stick to him the rest of his life
can you imagine cobbs face when he reads this
if we could sell tickets wed make a fortune
she covers the coin with palm of other hand and the coin disappears
but mac is too excited to pay any attention
howd you get the picture
had the boys follow us
reads again at two oclock this morning mr
deeds tied up traffic while he fed a bagful of doughnuts to a horse
when asked why he was doing it he replied i just wanted to see how many doughnuts this horse would eat before hed ask for a cup of coffee
what happened after that
i dont know
i had to duck to get the story out
he was so far along he never even missed me
whenre you going to see him again
looks at her watch ill phone him at noon
explaining oh my lunch hour
im a stenographer you know
laughing youre a genius babe a genius
i even moved into mabel dawsons apartment in case old snoopy cobb might start looking around
all excited good

ill tell everybody youre on your vacation
theyll never know where the stories are coming from
stick close to him babe you can get an exclusive story out of him every day for a month
well have the other papers crazy
starts for her babe i could kiss you
sidestepping oh no
our deal was for a months vacation with pay
she is out the door
yelling after her youll get it babe

walter leans over the bed violently shaking longfellow who is lost in drunken sleep
deeds sir you really must get up
without budging without opening his eyes youre walter arent you
i just wanted to make sure
if youll permit me to say so sir you were out on quite a bender last night sir
longfellow opens one eye and then the other blinking
as consciousness returns to him he glances around the room as if to get his bearings
youre wrong walter
we started out to a binge but we never got to it
walter offers him a drink on a tray
humoring him yes sir
a prairie oyster sir
slow to comprehend anything prairie
it makes the head feel smaller
longfellow takes it and downs it in one swig
his face finally reacting oh
remembering has miss dawson called yet
miss dawson sir
no miss dawson has called sir
she was a lady in distress
she wouldnt let me help her
got a lot of pride
i like that
oh i do too sir
id better call her up and apologize
i dont remember taking her home last night
id venture to say sir you dont remember much of anything that happened last night sir
what do you mean
i remember everything
hand me my pants i wrote her phone number on a piece of paper
you have no pants sir
longfellow looks up slowly
walter goes on you came home last night without them
after a double take i did what
as a matter of fact you came home without any clothes
you were in your uh shorts
oh dont be silly walter
i couldnt walk around in the streets without any clothes
id be arrested
thats what the two policemen said sir
what two policemen
the ones who brought you home sir
they said you and another gentleman kept walking up and down the streets shouting back to nature
clothes are a blight on civilization
back to nature
longfellow watches his face fascinated
slowly it is all coming back to him
listen walter if a man named morrow calls up tell him im not in
he may be a great author but i think hes crazy
the mans crazy walter
by the way did you longfellow slowly swings out of bed into a sitting position
walter kneels to put on longfellows slippers
longfellow balks points silently reminding walter that he has broken his promise not to kneel down in front of him
but howll i put on the slipper sir
longfellows expression begs no disagreement
walter stands fumbling with the shoes from a stooped posture
continuing yes sir
i beg pardon sir but did you ever find what you were looking for sir
you kept searching me last night sir
going through my pockets
you said you were looking for a rhyme for budington
flatly better bring me some coffee walter
very good sir
remembering oh i beg pardon
a telegram came for you sir
he hands the telegram to longfellow ill get you some black coffee sir
following walters exit
longfellow quickly opens the telegram
his face clouds
at this moment cobb comes bursting into the room a newspaper in his hand
wildly did you see all this stuff in the papers
holding out telegram arthur wants to quit
hes the shipping clerk at the tallow works
wants a raise or hell quit
he goes crazy what do i care about arthur
did you see this stuff in the paper
howd it get in there
whatd you do last night
who were you talking to
he flings the paper on the bed
longfellow glances at it and his face clouds
while longfellow reads and whatd you do to those bodyguards
they quit this morning
said you locked them up
oh they insisted on following me
wildly what do you think bodyguards are for
glances up what do they mean by this cinderella man
are those stories true
longfellow has his eyes glued on the paper
i dont remember
what do they mean by that
theyd call you anything if you gave them half a chance
theyve got you down as a sap
calmly i think ill go down and punch this editor on the nose
quickly no you dont
get this clear socking people is no solution for anything
sometimes its the only solution
take my word for it
if theyre going to poke fun at me im going to bends over earnestly listen
youve got brains kid
youll get along swell if youll only curb your homicidal instincts and keep your trap shut
dont talk to anybody
these newshounds are out gunning for you
referring to paper but what about this cinderella man
thats my job
ill take care of that
ill keep that stuff out of the papers if youll help me
but i cant do anything if you go around talking to people
will you promise me to be careful from now on
yes i guess ill have to
mopping his brow thank you
as he goes if you feel the building rock itll be me blasting into this editor
during the scene walter has entered with a tray which he has adjusted on longfellows knee
i mustnt talk to anybody
entering miss dawson on the phone sir
ill talk to her
give me the phone quick
shes the only one im going to talk to from now on
as the butler scurries around for the phone longfellow looks around absorbed
babe watches him
its awfully nice of you to show me around like this
i enjoy it
the aquarium was swell
if i lived in new york id go there every day
ill bet you do
well id like to but i have a job to think of
directly behind the bus
a mans head is stuck out of taxi window
we recognize it as one of the photographers bob
to driver hey flap ears
you better keep following that bus
keep your shirt on
two photographers with their equipment
they keep their eyes glued on the bus in front
they return to their seats
it dont look as though were gonna get any pictures tonight
babe ought to get him drunk again
got any news catches herself i mean has anything exciting been happening lately
i met you
whats happening about the opera
oh that well we had another meeting
i told them id go on being chairman if explaining im chairman you know
yes i know

what did they say
gosh you look pretty tonight
what did they say
they said i was crazy
said i wanted to run it like a grocery store
what are they going to do
leans over close to her do you always wear your hair like that
at this point two girls pass by chattering
one girl has a paper open
isnt it a scream cinderella man
id like to get my hooks into that guy
somebodys probably taking him for plenty
they are gone
longfellow glares after them
babe is afraid to look up
quietly if they were men id knock their heads together
babe is silent
longfellow watches her for a moment
have you seen the papers
thats what i like about you
you think about a mans feelings
id like to go down to that newspaper and punch the fellow in the nose thats writing that stuff she looks up startled
i guess pretty soon everybody will be calling me cinderella man
babe has had an uncomfortable time of it and quickly changes the subject
would you like to walk the rest of the way
its so nice out
she jumps up from her seat and longfellow follows
favoring the taxi driver
hey wise guys
hes getting off
this sets off a mad scramble
ad lib hey come on
pull over to the curb
he stands across the street from grants tomb looking solemn
his eyes moist
she is unaware of his emotion
come on dont you want to see it
feast your eyes
is that it
to driver hey beetle puss
as they approach the monument
there you are
i hope youre not disappointed
throatily its wonderful
to most people its an awful letdown
in awe huh
i say to most people its a washout
that depends on what they see
looks up at him now what do you see
oh i see a small ohio farm boy becoming a great soldier
i see thousands of marching men
i see general lee with a broken heart surrendering and i can see the beginning of a new nation like abraham lincoln said
and i can see that ohio boy being inaugurated as president dreamily things like that can only happen in a country like america
to intercut with above speech
during his recital she watches his face fascinated
her impulse is to laugh but she finds that she cant
overcome he almost chokes on his final words excuse me
a switchboard operator fielding calls
cedar wont answer his phone
passing by say whats going on in the bosss office
the three cs and little b have been in there for over an hour
cedar paces the floor
his brothers look worried
budington is enthroned at cedars desk
i dont want to be critical john but here it is pouncing on him yes i know
a weeks gone by and we havent got the power of attorney yet
yes but you said walking way from him i dont care what i said
i cant strangle him can i
its ridiculous for us to have to worry about a boy like that
crosses to desk look at these articles about him
why hes carrying on like an idiot
exactly what i was saying to my wife when this who cares what you were saying to your wife
there is a moments awkward silence
the silence is broken by the buzzing of the dictograph
cedar crosses to it and snaps the button
as secretarys voice comes over dictograph yes
semple are still waiting
irritated i cant help it
let them wait
he snaps the dictograph off
those people have been in to see me every day this week
who are they
dismissing it relatives of old man semple
they keep insisting they should have some nuisance value
they say if it hadnt been for deeds theyd have gotten all the money
suddenly nuisance value
thinks a minutes crosses to door maybe they have
maybe they have
maybe they have
opens door mr
how do you do
the others all stand around as the semples enter
weve been trying to smoothly cutting her off im so sorry to have kept you waiting
how are you sir
i dont know what my secretary could
have been thinking to keep you waiting this long
to one of his brothers will you bring the chairs
will you have a cigar mr
semple takes the cigar rather flabbergasted at all the sudden attention showered upon him
from over their shoulders looking down on the lights and teeming activity of times square
theres times square
you can almost spit on it cant you
why dont you try
he does try
the wind blows it back on him
she laughs takes out a handkerchief and wipes it off his coat
as she wipes oh
its breezy up here
he doesnt say anything right away
youre worried about those articles theyre writing about you arent you
im not worrying any more
i suppose theyll go on writing them till they get tired
you dont believe all that stuff do you
a guilty look spreads over babes face
oh they just do it to sell the newspapers you know
yeah i guess so
what puzzles me is why people seem to get so much pleasure out of hurting each other
why dont they try liking each other once in a while
an awkward pause
shall we go
as babe and longfellow walk
spotting a park bench heres a nice place
anyway there arent any photographers around
bob and frank sneaking around in the bushes
you know you said something to me when you first met me that ive thought about a great deal
you said i was a lady in distress
oh that what did you mean by that
nothing there is a pause
have you got a are you uh engaged or anything
the corners of her mouth go up in sympathetic amusement
you dont go out with girls very much do you
oh i dont know
you must have met a lot of swell society girls since youve been here
dont you like them
i havent met anybody here that i like particularly
they all seem to have the st
awkwardly except you of course
a pause people here are funny
they work so hard at living they forget how to live thoughtfully leans back last night after i left you i was walking along and looking at the tall buildings
and i got to thinking about what thoreau said
they created a lot of grand palaces here but they forgot to create the noblemen to put in them
she stares at him curiously
id rather have mandrake falls
im from a small town too you know
probably as small as mandrake falls
finding a kindred soul gosh
what do you know about that
babe leans her head back in a reminiscent mood
we get a feeling that for the moment she has forgotten she is babe bennett out on a story
ah its a beautiful little town too
a row of poplar trees right along main street
always smelled as if it just had a bath
longfellow watches her face intently
ive often thought about going back
i used to have a lot of fun there when i was a little girl
i used to love to go fishing with my father
he was a lot like you my father was
talked like you too
sometimes hed let me hold the line while he smoked and wed just sit there for hours
and after awhile for no reason id go over and kiss him and sit in his lap
he never said very much but once i remember him saying no matter what happens honey dont complain
he sounds like a person worth while knowing
there is a pause while longfellow watches her and she is lost in thought
continuing he played in the town band too
i play the tuba yeah i know
what did he play
he taught me to play some
i can do swanee river
would you like to hear me
she picks up a couple of branches
with the two sticks she drums on the bench seat and sings swanee river
when she is finished though clearly delighted he shows her a long face of mock disappointment
oh i suppose you could do better
i can sing humoresque
ill bet you dont even know how it goes
you sing it over again and ill do humoresque with you
it had better be good
she starts again and he sings humoresque in counterpoint to her drumming
they wait with their camera
when they hear the singing they look up and then at each other in surprise
i wonder if theyd want to make it a quartet
longfellow and babe
they are having a grand time with their singing
a policeman saunters into the scene and stands watching them for a few seconds without their being conscious of his presence
he smiles shakes his head and passes on out of scene
over the shot we hear the low moan of a siren in the distance
they reach the climax of their song and laugh joyously
at this moment the shrieking of the siren is nearer and louder
longfellow looks up quickly
excited he jumps up and runs toward street
babe looks up surprised
as he runs off fire engine
i want to see how they do it
wait for me will you
frank grabs the camera
looks like the evening is not going to be wasted
they dash by the policeman who looks up startled
as the fire engine slows down and people are beginning to gather
we see longfellow running toward the truck and hopping aboard
as longfellow jumps on
hello what do you want
short salute captain deeds fire volunteer mandrake falls
amused hi cap
boys meet the captain
bob and frank running with their cameras toward longfellow
of typewriter carriage
it contains a paper upon which the following is typed longfellow deeds the cinderella man last night threw a defy into the teeth of the new york fire department that
when it comes to extinguishing conflagrations they had better look to their laurels camera pulls back and we find babe staring at the sheet of paper in front of her
her eyes have a distant look
several feet away from her mabel dawson stands in front of an easel working silently on a painting
she dabs at it and turning pauses a moment to watch babe who at the moment rests her forehead on the typewriter carriage
softly whats the matter hon
babe is too much absorbed to hear this
getting no response mabel turns and studies her for a few seconds
whats up babe
somethings eating you
my unfailing instinct tells me somethings gone wrong with the stew
murmuring dont be ridiculous
she again resumes her typing
mabel crosses to her and looks over her shoulder
you havent gotten very far have you
thats where you were an hour ago
come on lets knock off and go down to joes
the gangs waiting for us
jumping up i cant write it mabel
i dont know whats the matter with me
babe lights a cigarette

madame pomponi famous opera singer to launch deeds on social career longfellow is in bed in his pajamas playing the tuba

longfellow stops looking daggers at him
madame pomponi is on the telephone sir
she says everything is all set for the reception
what do you mean by coming in here when im playing
but shes on the telephone get out
pointing the evil fingers on you
walter hurries out
longfellow jumps up and chases him down the grand staircase
longfellow stops at the top of the stairs struck by an idea
showing walter at the bottom of the stairs and longfellow at the top
longfellow gives a shout from the top of the stairs
there is a discernible echo
hey did you hear that
longfellow gives another shout
there is another echo
he tries it again louder
it is all very satisfactory
pleased why thats an echo sir
you try it
timidly me sir
an order yeah
walter gives a bird like hoot
there is an echo
walter gives a louder hoot
each time an echo
a butler in a bathrobe emerges to see what all the hullabaloo is about
longfellow spots him
to butler you try it
but the butler clearly relishes the opportunity
he gives a little high pitched squeak
the butler tries it again much better
another man servant has emerged
longfellow points to him
you try it
the man servant tries it very raspy another tone altogether
waving like a conductor all together
a symphony of hoots shrieks barks and echoes
the household staff do it again
surveying the scene then dramatically let that be a lesson to you
with that longfellow spins on his heel and returns to his bedroom
there is a pause
the butler takes command of the other two
gesturing imperiously go back to your room both of you
walter and the man servant hasten to exit
the butler waits until nobody is looking then gives one final hoot
he murmurs to himself with satisfaction as he exits
limousines arriving from which guests emerge in full evening dress
madame pomponi greets a group of guests
ad lib chatter is heard
from inside music emanates
oh hello darling
so good of you to come
sweet of you to ask me
where is he
im just dying to see the cinderella man
camera moves swiftly among groups of people picking out vignettes of conversation
longfellow is the hot topic
a husband and a wife whispering shh
he may hear you
even if he heard you he wouldnt understand
a man and a woman gossiping i hear he still believes in santa claus
will he be santa claus
thats what i want to know
another man holding forth to two elegantly dressed women have you all got your slippers ready for the cinderella man
ad lib yes i have
with he doesnt have to have looks
he wont have it long with that pomponi woman hanging around him
two women in evening dress twittering like birds to other woman my dear i hear he cant think unless he plays his tuba
babe is listlessly packing her few things in a small handbag
she slowly and meticulously folds a silken undergarment wrapping it in tissue
her eyes have a distant look
mabel watches her concerned
there is a long pause before either of them speaks
breaking the silence youre a fool babe
i just couldnt stand seeing him again
running away is no solution
babe is unresponsive
after a pause whatll i tell him if he calls up
tell him i had to leave suddenly
i got a job in china some place
youre acting like a school girl
suddenly tensely what else can i do
keeping this up is no good
hes bound to find out sometime
softly at least i can save him that
they are suddenly startled by the boisterous entrance of bob and frank whose voices are heard as they barge in
babe not wishing to explain to them hides her bag and follows mabel to greet them in the living room
the boys cross to a table and drop their cameras
say where is everybody
come on babe the artillerys ready
babe stands in doorway
by way of greeting its those two sore spots again
you shoulda been down to the office today babe
mac threw cobb out again
boy was he burning
reaching for a bottle just one little drink and then were ready to shoot
grabbing it away just a minute
no you dont
were not going out tonight
thought you had a date with him
hes having a party at his house
frank bob and mabel
say whats the matter with her now you wouldnt know if i drew you a diagram
now run along and peddle your little tin types
what is this
throwing us out of heres getting to be a regular habit
there is a knock on the door
they all look up
as mabel opens the door slightly
we see longfellow
mabels eyes open in surprise
is mary dawson here
im longfellow deeds
they stand stupefied
she waves her hand back of her for them to hide
loud for the boys oh
oh yes of course
step in please
they duck behind the sofa camera panning longfellow enters
mabel closes the door behind him watching him speculatively
longfellow turns to mabel
youre mabel her sister arent you
oh yes yes of course
yes ive been her sister for a long time
is she home
is mary home
they look at each other stupidly smiling feebly
featuring the camera
a hand comes in from behind the sofa and yanks the camera out of sight
mabel and longfellow still standing looking at each other
yes of course
well i dont know whether shes home or not
as she turns babe appears in doorway
why there she is
of course shes home
feebly stupid of me
i waited in the park for you over an hour
i thought maybe youd forgotten
mabel in b
i didnt think you could come with the party and everything
oh i wouldnt let them stop me from seeing you
so i threw them out
you threw them out
you mean gesturing with hands by the neck or something
they got on my nerves so i threw em out
mabel raises her eyebrows
i guess thatll be in the papers tomorrow
it will give em something else to laugh at
her face clouds miserably
lightly i dont mind though
i had a lot of fun doing it
quickly would you like to go for a walk
yes if it isnt too late
going to bedroom ill get my hat
she disappears leaving mabel and longfellow again staring at each other self consciously
mabel smiles ill at ease
nice day out er nice night wasnt it
tremulously yes lovely
weve had a lot of nice weather lately
after a pause it would be a nice night to go for a walk dont you think
oh yes i think itd be a swell night to go for a walk
a nice long one
bob and frank holding their breaths
babe comes out of bedroom
gosh she looks better every time i see her
vaguely thank you
she crosses to the door
to mabel goodnight
i wont keep her out late
thank you so much
mabel sighs relievedly
the boys jump from their crouching positions
wobbling forward ow
my foots asleep
grabbing camera come on lets go
frank grabs his camera and both bolt toward the door
mabel gets there one step ahead of them and blocks their path
no you dont
just a minute
no more photographs
as they walk slowly down the front steps
the reason why i wanted to take a walk mary is cause i wanted to talk to you
lets just walk okay
as they walk along a foggy street on their faces
mary im going home
in a day or so i think
i dont blame you
continuing on them as they slowly walk around the block
a man ought to know where he fits in
i just dont fit in around here
i once had an idea i could do something with the money but they kept me so busy here i havent had time to figure it out
i guess ill wait till i get back home
there is a long pause
both lost in their own thoughts
do you mind if i talk to you mary
you dont have to pay any attention to me
no i dont mind
all my life ive wanted somebody to talk to
back in mandrake falls i always used to talk to a girl
oh an imaginary one
i used to hike a lot through the woods and id always take this girl
with me so i could talk to her
id show her my pet trees and things
sounds kind of silly but we had a lot of fun doing it
smiling she was beautiful
then moodily i havent married cause ive been kinda waiting
you know my mother and father were a great couple
i thought i might have the same kind of luck
ive always hoped that some day that imaginary girl would turn out to be real
they have arrived back at the front steps of babes home
well here we are again
yes here we are again
after a pause good night
then quickly his voice faltering mary i excuse me favoring babe
she cuts him off her voice shaking
dont let anybody hurt you again ever
they cant anyway
youre much too real
you go back to mandrake falls
thats where you belong goodbye
she runs up the steps
mary she stops and turns
he walks up close to her
you know the poem i told you about
his hand goes to his breast pocket and then slowly is withdrawn without bringing out the poem
would you like to read it
its to you
scarcely audible yes of course
he now takes the poem out
the paper is folded
he hands it to her and she slowly unfolds it
just as she is about to read longfellow lays a hand on her arm
a little frightened you dont have to say anything mary
you can tell me tomorrow what you think
she looks into his eyes but does not respond
then she holds the paper up and begins reading
longfellow watches her anxiously
reading softly i tramped the earth with hopeless beat searching in vain for a glimpse of you
then heaven thrust you at my very feet a lovely angel too lovely to woo
the last words come with difficulty
babes eyes are slowly welling up
babe continues reading my dream has been answered but my lifes just as bleak im handcuffed and speechless in your presence divine for my heart longs to cry out if
it only would speak i love you my angel be mine be mine
her voice is choked when she finishes
she does not look up until she refolds the paper
he stands close to her waiting expectantly
finally she glances up
her cheeks are moist and her face clouded
impulsively she throws her arms around his neck kissing him
longfellows arms encircle her and for a few moments they remain in an emotional embrace
huskily you dont have to say anything now
ill wait till tomorrow till i hear from you
her eyes are beset with fears
she loves him but knows how hopeless it all is
she slowly starts freeing herself from his embrace
as babe weeping softly frees herself from his embrace
longfellow gives a yelp of joy and leaps down the steps
he trips over a garbage pail and bumps into passersby making a racket as he zigzags down the street and out of scene
shouting hey whats the big idea
behind his desk
stop it babe
what do you mean youre quitting
you might as well tell me im quitting
as he speaks camera draws back to reveal babe near a window peering out moodily
mac crosses over to her side
whats bothering you huh
after a pause last night he proposed to me
proposed to you
you mean he asked you to marry him
alert why babe thats terrific
sees it in print cinderella man woos mystery girl
who is the mysterious girl that print one line of that and ill blow your place up
it would have made a swell story
i just got carried away
thats too bad
so he proposed to you huh
intrigued what a twist
you set out to nail him and he bitterly yeah
funny twist isnt it
suddenly say you havent gone and fallen for that mug have you
babes silence is eloquent
well ill be he places an arm tenderly around her shoulder
thats tough babe
babe smiles wryly
interested whatre you going to do
walking away im going to tell him the truth
tell him youre babe bennett
tell him youve been making a stooge out of him
im having lunch with him today
he expects an answer
its going to be pretty
you cant do that
over their shoulders from behind as mac comforts her
hell probably kick me right down the stairs
i only hope he does
ill put you on another job
you need never see him again eh
thats the rub
oh as bad as that huh
far away telling him is the long shot im going to take it
he watches her sympathetically
babe sighs resignedly
looking around well it was fun while it lasted mac
ill clean out my desk
she leaves him
mac is deeply moved by her problem
as longfellow in a buoyant mood emerges from his room and slides down the bannister of the grand staircase
table is set for two
two butlers putter around
longfellow enters full of expectant enthusiasm
he is in his shirt sleeves
he hovers over them checking their preparations
hows it going
yes quite all right
thank you sir
picking up a salt shaker and examining it gold eh
as he continues his puttering yes sir
is that the best youve got
oh yes sir
seizing on another detail those flowers are too high
wont be able to see her
lifts a bowl of flowers off get a smaller bowl will you
repeating his command as he hands the bowl to the other butler a smaller bowl of flowers
exiting with flowers yes sir
a smaller bowl of flowers
to butler did you get that stuff i was telling you about
that stuff that tastes like soap
oh yes sir
here it is sir
the pate de fois gras sir
yeah thats fine
have a lot of it because she likes it
the other butler returns with a small bowl of flowers which he places in the center of the table
now you got the idea
he sits in one of the chairs and leans forward in an imaginary conversation with babe his lips move but we hear nothing
motions to butler sit over there will you
the butler sits
youre too tall
slink lower will you
the butler does it
they are practically nose to nose over the flowers
seriously how is this sir
i wish you luck sir
now dont touch a thing
leave everything as it is
he hurries toward his bedroom
walter where are you
walter enters panic stricken
what is it sir
anything happened anything happened
ive got to get dressed
i cant meet her like this
but she isnt due for an hour sir
whats an hour
you know how time flies walter
very good sir
here it is right here sir
while putting it on he sings humoresque loudly and gaily
at this moment cobb bursts in his face grim just as i suspected wise guy
i dont mind you making a sap out of yourself but you made one out of me too
to walter merrily will you tell the gentleman im not in
mary dawson huh
mary dawson my eye
that dame took you for a sleigh ride that new york will laugh about for years
shes the slickest two timing double crossing at the mention of the name longfellow turns for the first time
his face goes livid as cobbs voice continues between clenched teeth what are you talking about
longfellow has started out toward him
in two long strides longfellow has grabbed cobb by the shirt front ready to strangle him
sock away and then try to laugh this off
with his free hand he reaches into his coat pocket
he unrolls a newspaper
longfellow shifts his glance over to the photograph in the newspaper cobb holds up and slowly his grip on cobb relaxes
he takes the newspaper
as he looks at the picture
under which is the following louise babe bennett wins pulitzer prize for reportorial job on macklyn love triange
longfellow stares long and unbelievingly at the picture
adjusting his clothes shes the star reporter on the mail
every time you opened your kisser you gave her another story
shes the dame who slapped that monicker on you cinderella man
youve been making love to a double dose of cyanide
an outcry shut up
longfellow stunned crosses to the bed camera panning with him
he slumps down and continues staring at picture
cobb crosses to phone and picks up receiver
babe is at her desk
she has just finished rummaging through her desk
many articles are on top
mac is by her side
babe flicks the pages of a small loose leaf book and hands it to mac
this is for you mac
the names of all the headwaiters in town
you can always buy a bit of choice scandal from them at reasonable prices
aw listen babe i cant let you quit now
youre not going through with this thing are you
babe shakes her head with finality as the phone bell rings
picking up receiver ive seen em get in a rut like you before but they always come back
into phone hello
just a minute
he holds the receiver out to her
its for you
in a couple weeks youll get the itch so bad youll be working for nothing
into phone hello
cobb is at the phone
just a minute
he listens and hands phone to longfellow
into phone hello mary
at phone oh hello darling
her face goes dead as she realizes she is speaking to longfellow
at phone strained is it you whos been writing those articles about me
why uh i was just leaving ill be up there in a minute listens look uh yes i did but i was just coming up to explain the words die
in her throat
she looks dully at the receiver
coming over phone oh listen darling wait a minute
listen he hangs up
his face is a dead mask every illusion shattered
slowly a wry smile appears on his face and rising he wanders around the room in deep abstraction
cobb and walter watch him sympathetically
longfellow is silent a long time
as a butler enters
i beg pardon sir
shall i serve the wine with the squab sir
longfellow doesnt hear him
tries again i beg pardon sir
his face softens
if i knew you were going to take it so hard i woulda kept my mouth shut
as finally longfellow speaks without turning
quietly pack my things walter
im going home
he immediately busies himself
longfellow emerges from his bedroom walking briskly toward the staircase immediately followed by cobb and walter
walter is loaded down with suitcases
longfellow is wearing coat and hat
trying to keep up with longfellow you shouldnt be running away like this
whats going to happen to the estate
they can have the estate
as they approach the staircase a commotion is heard from stairs
cobb hurries ahead to see what is going on
two butlers are struggling with a wild eyed man of middle age
they shout in unison
simultaneously you cant come up here
let me go
i wanna see him
hes not home i tell you
i wanna see that guy
well send for the police
let me go
they continue to struggle as cobb reaches them
whats going on here
the man yanks himself free
there he is
i just wanted to get a look at him
he sees longfellow over cobbs shoulder
there you are
i just wanted to see what kind of a man you were
he struggles to thrust cobb aside
favoring longfellow who has reached the bottom of the staircase and watches the man warily
wildly i just wanted to see what a man looks like that can spend thousands of dollars on a party while people around him are hungry
the cinderella man huh
did you ever stop to think how many families could have been fed on the money you pay out to get on the front pages
cobb forcibly restrains the man
take him out of here
let me go
an order let him alone
let me alone
threateningly if you know whats good for you youll let me get this off my chest
to longfellow how did you feel feeding doughnuts to a horse
get a kick out of it huh
got a big laugh
sarcastically did you ever think of feeding doughnuts to human beings
longfellow stares at him
quietly shall i call the police sir
to man what do you want
yeah thats all thats worrying you
what do i want
a chance to feed a wife and kids
im a farmer
thats what i want
a farmer eh
youre a moocher thats what you are
i wouldnt believe you or anybody else on a stack of bibles
youre a moocher like all the rest of them around here so get out of here
sure everybodys a moocher to you
a mongrel dog eating out of a garbage pail is a moocher to you
starting to push him towards the door this wont do you any good the man shoves him away suddenly whips out a gun and levels it at him
stay where you are young feller
get over there
cobb backs away and the man points the gun at longfellow who remains staring at him immobilely
tensely youre about to get some more publicity mr
youre about to get on the front page again
see how youre going to like it this time
voice rises see what good your moneys going to do when youre six feet under ground
you never thought of that did you
all you ever thought of was pinching pennies you money grabbing hick
you never gave a thought to all of those starving people
his voice wavers standing in the bread lines huskily not knowing where their next meal was coming from
not able to feed their wife and kids
voice breaks not able to he cant go on
a sob escapes
he reaches up and brushes away a tear with a rough hand
it seems to bring him to his senses
he glances down and seeing the gun in his hand stares at it in surprise
he realizes what he was about to do
scarcely audible oh
the man slumps into a chair and the gun drops to the floor
cobb bends quickly and picks it up
longfellow never moves
dead voice staring into space im glad i didnt hurt nobody
he turns his head slowly and peers at them with non seeing eyes then suddenly he hides his face in his hands and sobs
you get all kinds of crazy ideas
longfellow watches him pityingly
i didnt know what i was doing
the rest of it seems to come out of him effortfully his voice breaking
losing your farm after twenty years work seeing your kids go hungry a game little wife saying everythings going to be all right
stridently standing there in the bread lines
it killed me to take a handout
pathetically i aint used to it
resigned go ahead and do what you want with me mister
scarcely audible i guess im at the end of my rope
he sobs openly
while he was speaking longfellow was peering into the mans face intently
as the man finishes at the table that was all set for babe
the man sits eating
he seriously bends over his food
longfellow sits opposite him his eyes glued on the man absorbed in profound thought
tentatively can i take some of this home with me
huge farming district to be divided into ten acre farms fully equipped at a cost of eighteen million dollars
a mob of shouting men and women clamor at the gates being jostled around by the police
it has been transformed into an office
longfellow sits at one end of the room
clerks are at several desks
on one side and leading out into the hall is a long line of men waiting to be interviewed
at longfellows desk
he has a two days growth of beard and looks worn
next to him is a clerk
in front of him is an applicant
as the camera moves in on him are you married
no no children
all right mr
i think youll qualify
he hands him a form take this to that desk over there for further instructions
gratefully exiting thank you very much
a man steps forward and stands in front of his desk
longfellow clerk and applicant
to clerk how many does that make
wearily is that all
its going awfully slow
we need more
phone rings hello
the water development seems okay but i dont like the road layout yet
come up tonight about ten and bring the maps
he hangs up
as the farmer in previous sequence approaches
heres the order for the plows
we got a good price on them
ill look em over later
deeds longfellow looks up
farmer goes on
my wife wanted me to tell you she hesitates she prays for you every night
embarrassed well thanks i uh to applicant in front of him how do you do
what is your name
george rankin sir
while longfellow writes cobb is on the phone
into phone no
were not buying any bulls
listen fellow bulls what ive been selling all my life
he slams down the receiver
cedar behind his desk
in front of him is henry semple and his nagging wife
cedar shoves a paper in front of semple
we have very little time
hes ordered me to turn everything over to him immediately
we have to work fast before he disposes of every penny
i told you something could be done
i knew it all the time
sign it dear
hesitating we may get into trouble
oh dont be so squeamish
there are millions involved
after all you have your legal rights
youre his only living relatives
as semple picks up the paper
whats it say
thats your agreement with mr
cedar if we win
you see my end is going to be rather expensive
i have a lot of important people to take care of
i have the legal machinery all set and ready to go
ive been working on nothing else for the last week
you say the word and well stop this yokel dead in his tracks
oh all right
with the perturbed expression still on his face semple reaches over to sign the document
simultaneously cedar flicks a button on his dictagraph
into dictagraph charlie were off
papers all set
go to it
afterthought and charlie yeah
find out who wrote those newspaper articles and subpoena them right away
a large raw boned swede stands before longfellow
what is your name
where is your farm
south dakota north
south dakota north
south dakota but on the top
cobb enters very businesslike
what about your knocking off for lunch
i want to get through this work in a hurry and then i want to go home
what price did you get on those trucks
come on come on
what are you trying to do kid
you havent been out of this house in two weeks
tired well maybe i will have a sandwich
to swede do you mind waiting a few minutes
undoing paper package oh sure sure
if you like to have a sandwich i can give you one please
he brings out two huge sandwiches and hands one to longfellow
never mind cobb
he takes it and he and the swede silently eat
longfellow looks up
the swede smiles
longfellow nibbles his sandwich then glances around the room
his gaze rests on of the long line of applicants waiting for an audience
calls to cobb cobb
get lunch for the rest of them
there must be of them out there
well that doesnt make em any less hungry
okay santa claus
longfellow glances over at the line smiling
in front of the line there is a slight scuffle as a man is being pushed forward by some others
he mumbles a protest tries to get back into position but the men push him forward again
ad lib go on say something
he looks up inquiringly
the man finally is resigned and stands shifting ill at ease his head hanging bashfully
deeds the boys here wanted me to say a little something
they just wanted me to say that clears his throat well they wanted me to say that quickly gets it out we think youre swell and thats no baloney
say something more
he smiles self consciously
the spokesman apparently has not finished yet
directly behind the line three officious looking men have made their appearance and wait for him to conclude
give me a chance fellas
were all down and out but when a fellow like you comes along kinda gives us a little hope and they just wanted me to say its as far as
he gets as the three strangers break their way through the line and approach longfellows desk
ad lib break it up
pointing to longfellow thats him
are you longfellow deeds
looks up yes
shows paper weve got a warrant to take you into custody
without moving a what
a warrant for your arrest
youll have to come along with us
what do you mugs want
i dont know nothing buddy
all i know is the sheriff gives me an insanity warrant to execute
whos says hes insane
they all turn to charlie who comes forward
the complainant is a relative of the late martin semple
the charges are that mr
deeds is insane and incapable of handling the estate
oh somebody got panic stricken about his giving his dough away eh
to sheriff where do you think youre going to take him
to the county hospital
of course thats only temporary
a hearing will follow immediately
as he speaks quietly
just because i want to give this money to people who need it they think im crazy
cynically thats marvelous
that makes everything complete
to include group
lets get going
wait a minute
not so fast
were going to get a lawyer
ill call cedar
thoroughly disillusioned no dont bother
as a matter of fact im from mr
he represents the complainant
longfellow glances up at him and smiles bitterly
well lets go
were wasting a lot of time
he goes to one side of longfellow and his partner to the other
they take longfellow by the arms
he glances down casually and suddenly violently pushes the deputies away from him
they are thrown backward their eyes widen in surprise
calmly rising all right ill go
but get your hands off me
longfellow starts to walk forward accompanied by cobb and the two deputies and charlie fall in behind them
ad lib make way
to be intercut with above scene
they stare petrified and mumble to each other
of the farmers and other applicants
the line has fallen out and they stand in a bunch staring pathetically and hopelessly at the departing group
who stands in f
what is taking place has slowly penetrated his befuddled brain
the disappointment he feared is here
his body imperceptibly sags his eyes dim all hope having gone out of them
insert sign reading county hospital
a guard sits at a desk near a door talking on the telephone
on phone yes most everybody in town has been here to see him
goodbye babe rounds the corner quickly heading for the door
the guard hurriedly hangs up and stands to block her
sorry lady recognizes her oh its you again
ive got to see him
now listen sister for the fourteenth and last time he dont want to see nobody
pleading will you just give him my name
confidentially listen toots just between us there aint a thing in the world the matter with that guy till i mention your name then he goes haywire
babe winces under the blow
longfellow is seated by the far wall peering moodily out the window
cobb paces about
suddenly he wheels on longfellow
what are you going to do just sit back and let them railroad you
its as pretty a frameup as ever hit this rotten town
if youd just let me get you a lawyer
longfellow pays no attention to him
as cobb continues
raises his voice you cant walk into that courtroom without being ready to protect yourself in the clinches
cedars too smart
with the array of talent hes got lined up against you youre cooked
longfellow is still unresponsive
cobb thinks a moment watching him studiously then pleading tenderly listen pal i know just how you feel
a blonde in syracuse put me through the same paces
i came out with a sour puss but full of fight
come on you dont want to lay down now
longfellow is still unresponsive
do you realize whats happening
theyre trying to prove that youre nuts
if they win the case theyll shove you in the bughouse
the moment they accuse you of it they have you half licked
youve got to fight
longfellow disregards him and cobb sighs resignedly
the guard is reading his paper
babe is still waiting pacing
go on sit down wont you
as cobb comes out
the guard gets up to check the door is locked
so long mr
cobb in a troubled frame of mind doesnt respond and starts down corridor camera trucks with him
babe catches up with him
cobb doesnt stop
babe grabs his arm corny
cobb glares at babe belligerently
ive got to see him
ive got to talk to him
havent you done enough damage already
ignoring his attack somebodys got to help him
he hasnt got a chance against cedar
look ive been all over town talking to everybody
ive got mac all lined up and the papers behind him
and i can get him livingston too
with a lawyer like livingston hes got a fighting chance
coldly youre wasting your time
he doesnt want any lawyers
hes sunk so low he doesnt want help from anybody
bitterly you can take a bow for that
huskily as swell a guy as ever hit this town and you crucified him
for a couple of stinking headlines
youve done your bit now stay out of his way
he exits abruptly leaving babe staring despairingly at his disappearing back his brutal diatribe ringing harshly in her ears
semple heir charged with incompetency
should be confined to an institution declares cedar
longfellow deeds refuses counsel remains incommunicado
farmers aroused at efforts to balk their benefactor
police surround courthouse in anticipation of outbreak
of an unruly mob being jostled by the police
the corridor is jammed with curious public endeavoring to gain entrance
perspiring police fight to keep them back
it is practically full
the few empty seats are being quickly filled
people stumble over each other to find a seat
the judge is not yet at his bench
there is a general chatter of excitement and anticipation
among the spectators babe sits beside mac
she stares expression less
mac glances at her sympathetically
featuring the farmer who broke into longfellows house
near him is the swede we saw and others
cedar and his assistants arrange their papers
two dignified gentlemen psychiatrists await action arms folded
near them is henry semple the complainant his nose twitching nervously
by his side is his wife sparkling expectantly
at which sit a dozen newspaper reporters
from a side door longfellow enters accompanied by his guard
immediately the place is astir
as he advances to a chair in front of a table necks crane for a glimpse
whispered conversations take place
he looks guilty nose twitching more violently than ever
to cedar here he is
babe sits up her eyes riveted on longfellow
impulsively she starts to rise but mac puts a restraining hand on her
longfellow turns neither to left nor right
he is slumped low in his chair staring solemnly into space
cobb breaks into scene and sits down beside him
full of excitement cedar just sent for me
wants to make a settlement
heres your chance to get out of the whole mess
what do you say
he gets no response from longfellow
there is a stir in the courtroom
the bailiff calls out as the judge proceeds to his bench
the supreme court of the state of new york county of new york is now in session the honorable john may judge presiding
to include judge and longfellow
the court wishes to warn those present that it will tolerate no disturbances
to longfellow regarding the sanity hearing of longfellow deeds are you represented by counsel mr
almost imperceptibly longfellow shakes his head no
the judge looks troubled
there is a stir in the courtroom
i understand that you have no counsel mr
in fact that you have no intention of defending any of these charges
now if you wish to change your mind the hearing can be postponed
getting no response from longfellow the judge shrugs his shoulders
cedar is on his feet
addressing the court and in the interests of my client the only other living relative of the late martin w
semple we cannot permit a fortune so huge to be dissipated by a person whose incompetency and abnormality we shall prove beyond any reasonable doubt
i have before me a series of articles written by a newspaper woman who was an eye witness to his conduct ever since he came to new york
camera stops on babe and mac
cedars voice goes on she tells how in the midst of a normal conversation he would suddenly begin playing his tuba
she tells of his attacks upon several of our eminent writers for no apparent reason
in fact there are many instances not recorded in these articles in which mr
deeds satisfied an unnatural desire to smash people up without provocation
i myself unable to keep pace with his mental quirks and constantly fearful of assault turned down an opportunity to represent him as his attorney
this newspaper woman whom we have subpoenaed to testify tells how he tied up traffic for an hour feeding doughnuts to a poor horse
and by his own statement waiting for that horse to ask for a cup of coffee
there is laughter in the courtroom which quickly subsides when the judge pounds his gavel
we have photographs to substantiate this little episode and other photographs showing mr
deeds jumping upon a fire engine
this scarcely sounds like the action of a man in whom the disposition of twenty million dollars may safely be entrusted
this writer of these articles a woman whose intelligence and integrity in the newspaper world is unquestioned held him in such contempt that she quite aptly named him the cinderella
we have witnesses here from mandrake falls his own home town who will tell of his conduct throughout his lifetime proving that his derangement is neither recent nor a temporary
longfellows interest is only slightly aroused
he lifts his eyes in a casual glance around him
we have others who will tell of his unusual behavior when he invited the great leaders of the musical world to his home and then proceeded to forcibly eject them
only recently when he was in the county hospital for observation he not only refused to be examined by these gentlemen the state psychiatrists but he actually made a violent
attack upon them
as cedar continues talking camera pulls back to wider shot
in these times with the country incapacitated by economic ailments and endangered with an undercurrent of social unrest the promulgation of such a weird fantastic and impractical plan as contemplated
by the defendant is capable of fomenting a disturbance from which the country may not soon recover
it is our duty to stop it
our government is fully aware of its difficulties and can pull itself out of its economic rut without the assistance of mr
deeds or any other crackpot
of farmers the swede and others
his attempted action must therefore be attributed to a diseased mind afflicted with hallucinations of grandeur and obsessed with an insane desire to become a public benefactor
suddenly your honor at this time we would like to call our first witness miss louise babe bennett
there is a mild stir and all wait expectantly for babe to appear
miss bennett please
babe eyes on longfellow slowly walks to the stand
he has his face averted and doesnt look at her
babe continues to rivet her eyes on longfellow as she is sworn in
raise your right hand please
she does so
do you solemnly swear the testimony you may give before this court to be the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you god
state your right name please
take the stand
as cedar steps up to question babe
judge in f
miss bennett are you employed by the morning mail
there is no answer
babe continues to stare off at longfellow hoping he will look up
cedar speaks to her again i must ask you to direct your attention to me
but babes attention remains focused on longfellow
appealing to judge your honor this is ridiculous
please answer the questions
wildly the whole hearings ridiculous
that mans no more insane than you are
the suddenness of her outbreak is startling
the judge pounds his gavel
the judge pounding his gavel
miss bennett please
this is outrageous
rising to stand its obviously a frameup
theyre trying to railroad this man for the money they can get out of him
the judge pounds his gavel throughout her speech
highly young lady another outburst like that and i shall hold you in contempt
were not interested in your opinion of the merits of this case
youre here to testify
sit down and answer the questions
cedar beams victoriously
thank you your honor
are you employed by the morning mail
cedars eyes widen in surprise
there is a light stir
threateningly you are under oath miss bennett
i ask you again are you employed by the morning mail
i resigned last week
as cedar proceeds without interruption
well prior to that time were you employed by the morning mail
were you given an assignment to follow the activities of longfellow deeds
did you subsequently write a series of articles about him
holding them up are these the articles
were you present when all these things took place
are they true
but they did take place
just to make him look silly
and you saw them happen
yes but i preemptorily thats all miss bennett
half shrieking it isnt all
id like to explain
brusquely thats all miss bennett
a bailiff takes babe by the arm
come on miss come on
simultaneously to judge your honor id like to submit these articles as evidence
babe struggles away from the bailiff
frantically let go of me
steps up to judge wildly what kind of hearing is this
what are you trying to do persecute the man
hes not defending himself
somebodys got to do it
throughout her tirade the judge has been angrily pounding his gavel
miss bennett please
featuring babe and judge
ive got a right to be heard
ive attended dozens of cases like this
theyre usually conducted without any formality at all
anybody can be heard
my opinion is as good as these quack psychiatrists
i know him better than they do
miss bennett if you have quite finished i should like to inform you that one more utterance from you and i shall place you under arrest
leans back im willing to hear anything anyone has to say but i insist on it being done in an orderly fashion
when you have learned to show some respect for this court you may return
dismissing her until then youd better go back to your seat and calm down
this way miss
as babe is led away there is another courtroom stir
order in the court
when babe is out of sight the judge turns to longfellow
deeds have you anything to say in defense of these articles
longfellow shakes his head
cobb glances to him helplessly
again no reply mark these exhibit a for the plaintiff
yes your honor
as she sits down beside mac who places an affectionate arm around her shoulders
two old ladies are being led to the witness stand
their eyelids flutter excitedly as they go
he looks up sees the old ladies and smiles at them friendily
against the drone of the clerk who swears witnesses in the falkner sisters are rather timid your honor and wish to be together
if the court pleases i will only have one of them testify
lets get on with it
cedar turns to them
as cedar addresses one of the old ladies
what is your name please
this is my sister amy
agreeing yes amy
ill direct my questions to you miss jane
you can answer for both
do you know the defendant mr
the two old ladies look at each other then in the direction in which cedar points
oh yes yes of course we know him
a little nervously how long have you known him
jane turns to her sister and they whisper to each other
turns to cedar since he was born
elsie taggart was the midwife
he was a seven months baby
thank you thats fine
do you see him very often
the two old ladies have their whispered conference again
most every day
irascibly must we have the echo
suppose you just answer miss jane
now will you tell the court what everybody at home thinks of longfellow deeds
the two old ladies consult each other once more
they think hes pixilated
oh yes pixilated
leaning forward hes what
concerned what was that you said he was
patiently now thats a rather strange word to use miss jane
can you tell the court exactly what it means
while the two ladies go into a huddle as one of them speaks up
perhaps i can explain your honor
the word pixilated is an early american expression derived from the word pixies meaning elves
they would say the pixies had got him as we nowadays would say a man is balmy
the judge nods his understanding
the falkner sisters nod in pleasant agreement
cedar sighs victoriously
is that correct
now tell me why does everyone think hes uh pixilated
does he do peculiar things
after conferring with amy he walks in the rain without his hat and talks to himself
sometimes he whistles
recently he gave chuck dillon a thumping
blacked his eye
for no reason i guess
he always does it
we always run into the house when we see him coming
never can tell what hes going to do
he sure is pixilated
oh yes hes pixilated all right
thank you ladies
the old ladies leave to resume their seats
a policeman in uniform
they kept hollering back to nature
back to nature
i thought they looked harmless enough so i took them home
i never thought he was cracked
the waiter at tullios
im a waiter
he kept pressing me to point out the celebrities and so help me hannah im coming out of the kitchen a coupla minutes later and there he is moppin up
the floors with them
i never figured he was a guy looking for trouble
expostulating he threw us out bodily
of one of the bodyguards on witness stand
we was hired as his bodyguard see
well the first crack out of the box he throws us in a room and locks the door see
now if a thing like that gets around in our profession wed get the bird see
so i says to my partner lets quit this guy hes nuts
a cockney cabman
im very fond of clara sir
shes a nice orse
and when this bloke ere started feedin er doughnuts i yelled down to him mind what youre doin down there
mind what youre doing
of course i wouldnt mind sir but clara wont eat nothin but doughnuts now
of one of the photographers bob and enlarged photographs of longfellows antics
come to order
your honor i wish to call your attention to these exhibits
davis do you recognize these reproductions
sure theyre good enlargements
whered you have them made
did you make the originals of them
i took the originals
taking pictures is my business
i photograph a lot of nuts
as cedar speaks
and now your honor if the court pleases i shall call upon dr
emil von holler if he will be good enough to give us his opinion
von holler as you know is the eminent austrian psychiatrist probably the greatest authority on the subject in the world
at present he is in this country on a lecture tour and has graciously volunteered his services
while he is still speaking dr
as the clerk finishes swearing dr
von holler in
do you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give in the cause now pending before this court shall be the truth the whole truth and nothing but the
truth so help you god
state your right name please
a slight austrian accent emil von holler
take the stand
on von holler and cedar
von holler will you kindly tell the court what your opinion is on this case
this is purely a case of manic depression
in cases of this kind patients sometimes go on for years before being detected
he turns to one of the psychiatrists sitting with the judge
you remember dr
fosdick in my last book there are some very fine examples
nodding uh huh
especially the one of the young nobleman you remember
yes of course dr
it reminds me very much of this one
it takes so long to detect them to judge because their mood changes so often and so quickly
now your honor may i show you
may i use the chart
by all means
he moves to a blackboard
there are chalk marks on it
a straight line runs diagonally across the center
other lines run zig zag over and below this center line
indicating chart below here they are extremely depressed melancholy impossible to live with and often become violent
running a line up from this mood the manic depressive might gradually change until they reach this state
he reaches the center line here is lucidity
here they are perfectly normal
as normal as you or i smiling assuming of course that we are normal
he starts up with chalk then the mood changes again until chalk reaches top they reach this state a state of highest exaltation
here everything is fine
here the world is beautiful
here they are so elated how do you express it
quickly as it comes to him they would give you the shirt off their backs
von holler how would you say that applied to mr
the symptoms are obvious
points to top line when he was here on top of the wave he felt nothing but kindliness and warmth toward his fellow men
he wanted them around him
so he decided he would give a big reception
but in the meantime his mood has changed
chalk goes down he is now at the bottom of the wave depressed melancholy
so when his guests arrive he throws them out
they are now his imaginary enemies
as von hollers voice continues other instances of high elation are when he plays his tuba when he writes his poetry when he chases fire engines in his desire to
this is contrasted with his present mood which is so low that even the instinct for self preservation is lacking
von holler still continues oh the man is verrukt
your honor this is decidedly a case of a manic depressive
thank you dr
von holler returns to his seat
your honor we rest
there is a shifting of bodies and a renewed interest as they wait for the next move
the judge and his own two experts go into an inaudible huddle
longfellow is slumped in his seat head down
come on whatre you going to do
let them get away with it
they got you cooked
longfellow does not budge
there is an expectant stir in the courtroom among the spectators and rows of reporters
judge comes out of his huddle and glances at longfellow
leaning forward mr
deeds before the court arrives at a decision isnt there anything you wish to say
longfellow shakes his head slightly
whispering come on dont be a sap
the judge watches him a few moments hesitatingly and then turns to his experts
they smirk confidently
she stares panic stricken
of the swede the farmer and others
their faces show their resentment
to the two experts you both concur
ad lib oh positively
the judge emerges from his consultation with his experts and addresses longfellow
deeds in view of the extensive testimony and your continued silence and upon recommendation of the doctors the court considers it advisable for your own safety that you be committed
to an institution as prescribed by law
you need medical attention mr
shrugs perhaps in a little while suddenly the air is rent with the shrill voice of babe
wait a minute
all are startled and look up
babe runs right to the judge
you cant do it
youve got to make him talk
your honor i object
she turns directly to longfellow leaning over close to him
pleading softly oh darling please
i know everything ive done
i know how horrible ive been
no matter what happens if you never see me again do this for me
miss bennett please
frantically you said i could speak
you said i could have my say if i were rational
please let me take the witness chair
he must be made to defend himself before you arrive at a decision
take the stand
babe goes up to the witness stand and sits down
oh thank you
shouting your honor what she is saying has no bearing on the case
let her speak
i know why he wont defend himself
that has a bearing on the case hasnt it
hes been hurt
hes been hurt by everybodys he met since he came here principally by me
hes been the victim of every conniving crook in town
the newspapers pounced on him made him a target for their feeble humor
i was smarter than the rest of them
i got closer to him so i could laugh louder
why shouldnt he keep quiet
every time he said anything it was twisted around to sound imbecilic
as she continues
he can thank me for it
i handed the gang a grand laugh
this is a fitting climax to my sense of humor
as cedar protests
but your honor this is preposterous
the judge waves him down with a dismissing gesture of his hand
certainly i wrote those articles
i was going to get a raise and a months vacation
but i stopped writing them when i found out what he was all about
when i realized how real he was
as babes voice continues he could never fit in with our distorted viewpoint because hes honest and sincere and good
if that man is crazy your honor the rest of us belong in straight jackets
cedar jumps up
your honor this is absurd
the womans obviously in love with him
whats that got to do with it
shouting well you are in love with him arent you
shouting back whats that got to do with it
louder you are arent you
just as loud yes
to be intercut during her speech
at first he merely glances up at her speculatively
finally he begins to show some interest
cedar turns to the judge
your honor her testimony is of no value
why shouldnt she defend him
its a tribute to american womanhood the instinct to protect the weak
im not saying that nobody likes the boy
i cherish a fond affection for him myself
but that doesnt mean to say in the middle of his speech mac the editor appears at his elbow
when the windbag here gets through your honor id like to verify what miss bennett said
im her editor
when she quit her job she told me what a swell fellow this man was
and anything babe bennett says is okay with me
if you have anything to say you will take the stand
ive already said it your honor
i just thought id like to get my two cents in
as he starts to go camera panning with him he passes longfellow
he nudges him
dont be a sucker pal
stand up and speak your piece
he disappears to his seat
your honor ive got a couple of cents id like to put in
ive been with this man ever since he came to new york shooting toward the judge
he pounds his gavel interrupting cobb
there will be no further interruptions
almost simultaneously with the judges speech the farmer somewhere in the audience rises to his feet
how about us mr
shooting toward audience
as the farmer finishes a dozen others are on their feet
ad lib yes
what about us mr
youre not going to leave us out in the cold
theyre trying to frame you mr
the turmoil is general with bailiffs running to quiet them
the judge pounding his gavel incensed
when quiet reigns in the interest of mr
deeds i have tolerated a great deal of informality
but if there is one more outburst i shall have the courtroom cleared
your honor surprised yes
id like to get in my two cents worth
take the stand
there is a general stir of excitement and whispering
her eyes sparkle happily
the clients look up at cedar concerned
cedar comforts them with a confident grimace
to include longfellow judge and others around them
well i dont know where to begin
theres been so many things said about me that longfellow continues about my playing the tuba
seems like a lot of fuss has been made about that
if a mans crazy just cause he plays the tuba then somebody better look into it cause there are a lot of tuba players running around loose
of course i dont see any harm in it
i play mine whenever i want to concentrate
that may sound funny to some people but everybody does something silly when theyre thinking
for instance the judge here is an o filler
front of courtroom
an o filler
you fill in all the spaces in the os with your pencil
points to desk i was watching you
the judge looks down at a paper in front of him
of some sort
all the os and ps and rs have the white spaces pencilled in
as he looks up from the document
he is a trifle self conscious
laughter comes from the courtroom
that may make you look a little crazy your honor just sitting around filling in os but i dont see anything wrong cause that helps you to think
other people are doodlers
thats a name we made up back home for people who make foolish designs on paper when theyre thinking
its called doodling
almost everybodys a doodler
did you ever see a scratch pad in a telephone booth
people draw the most idiotic pictures when theyre thinking
von holler here could probably think up a long name for it because he doodles all the time
von holler who is in the middle of some doodling flinches
a roar of laughter comes from the spectators
longfellow reaches over to where dr
von holler sits and picks up a piece of paper
von holler thank you
returning to the stand this is a piece of paper he was scribbling on
scrutinizes it i cant figure it out
one minute it looks like a chimpanzee and the next minute it looks like a picture of mr
hands it to him you look at it judge
the judge with a serious mien takes the paper
it is a doodle face
von holler is somewhat uncomfortable
exhibit a for the defense
after a pause looks kind of stupid doesnt it your honor
but i guess thats all right if dr
von holler has to doodle to help him think
thats his business
everybody does something different
some people are demonstrates ear pullers some are nail biters pointing that mr
semple over there is a nose twitcher
he looks up startled his nose twitching more violently than ever
the courtroom rocks with laughter
his wife in her nervousness pulls at her fingers
and the lady next to him is a knuckle cracker
semple quickly drops her hands in her lap as the courtroom again fills with laughter
he swings a key ring around his forefinger
suddenly he realizes longfellow might get to him and he hastily palms the keys and shoves them in his pocket
one is leaning forward listening intently biting the end of his pencil
the one next to him nudges him and silently points to the pencil in his mouth
the reporter gets the idea and smiling sheepishly yanks it out of his mouth
so you see everybody does silly things to help them think
in conclusion well i play the tuba
as he bursts forth
nice work toots
the crowd echoes him with shouts and laughter
he glares off scene at mac reprimandingly
she is amused at the embarassment longfellow has caused them all
they squirm uncomfortably
longfellow in chair judge at bench b
deeds do you recall forcibly ejecting people from your home
about my throwing those people out of my house
pomponi told the truth
i did throw them out because i didnt want the party in the first place
i didnt invite anybody
pomponi did all that
they just came to see what kind of a freak the cinderella man was
i dont know how people like that are supposed to act your honor but if that pomponi woman is an example ill stick to simple folks
she just came in talked my ear off and took charge of everything
if i were a friend of hers id have her examined
cedar who cannot stand it any longer jumps to his feet
your honor this is becoming farcical
i demand that mr
deeds dispense with side remarks and confine himself to facts
let him explain his wanderings around the streets in underclothes his feeding doughnuts to horses
those things do look kind of bad dont they
but to tell the truth your honor i dont remember them
i guess they happened all right because i dont think a policeman would lie about a thing like that but i was drunk
it was the first time i was ever drunk in my life
its probably happened to you some time
i mean when you were younger of course
the judge clears his throat in embarrassment
several women giggle
the judge sternly pounds his gavel
its likely to happen to anybody
just the other morning i read in the paper about mr
cedars own son about how he got drunk and insisted on driving a taxi cab while the driver sat inside
isnt that so mr
isnt that so mr
all eyes have turned to cedar
his eyes are beginning to blaze angrily
your honor i object
now about the falkner sisters
thats kind of funny
i mean about mr
cedar going all the way to mandrake falls to bring them here
do you mind if i talk to them
not at all
everybody stretches to get a better look at them
jane who owns the house you live in
the girls consult with each other
why you own it longfellow
yes you own it
do you pay any rent
after conferring with amy no we dont pay any rent
good heavens no
we never pay rent
as longfellow continues questioning are you happy there
now jane a little while ago you said i was pixilated
do you still think so
after the usual conference why youve always been pixilated longfellow
smiling thats fine
i guess maybe i am
seriously now tell me something jane
who else in mandrake falls is pixilated
jane turns to her sister and this time they go into a prolonged huddle
it is apparently a difficult thing to figure out
finally they come out of it
why everybody in mandrake falls in pixilated except us
there is an outburst of laughter which the judge quickly quells with his gavel
now just one more question
do you see the judge here
hes a nice man isnt he
do you think hes pixilated
quickly oh yes
there is more laughter
more pounding of the judiciary gavel
he feels his case slowly crumbling
she can scarcely conceal her elation
deeds you havent yet touched upon a most important thing
this rather fantastic idea of yours to want to give away your entire fortune
it is to say the least most uncommon
oh yes i was getting to that your honor
camera moves to closer shot featuring longfellow and judge as former continues suppose you were living in a small town and getting along fine and suddenly somebody dropped in your
supposing you discovered that all that money was messing up your life was bringing a lot of vultures around your neck and making you lose faith in everybody
youd be a little worried wouldnt you
youd feel that you had a hot potato in your hand and youd want to drop it
i guess dr
von holler would say you were riding on points to chart those bottom waves cause you wanted to drop something that was burning your fingers
cedar springs to his feet
shouting if this man is permitted to carry out his plan repercussions will be felt that will rock the foundations of our entire governmental system
the judge has pounded him into silence
to longfellow proceed
personally i dont know what mr
cedars raving about
from what i can see no matter what system of government we have there will always be leaders and always be followers
farmers in audience as longfellows voice continues its like the road out in front of my house
its on a steep hill
every day i watch the cars climbing up
some go lickety split up that hill on high some have to shift into second and some sputter and shake and slip back to the bottom again
same cars same gasoline yet some make it and some dont
and i say the fellows who can make the hill on high should stop once in a while and help those who cant
making his point thats all im trying to do with this money
help the fellows who cant make the hill on high
hotly what does mr
cedar expect me to do with it
give it to him and a lot of other people who dont need it
rising sarcastically if you dont mind your honor ill ride on those top waves for a minute
calls out hey all you fellows out there
all those who applied for a farm stand up
showing most of the audience struggling to their feet
see all those fellows
theyre the ones im trying to help
they need it
cedar and that mr
semple dont need anything
theyve got plenty
its like im out in a big boat and i see one fellow in a rowboat whos tired of rowing and wants a free ride and another fellow whos drowning
who would you expect me to rescue
cedar who just got tired of rowing and wants a free ride
or those men out there who are drowning
any ten year old child will give you the answer to that
to farmers etc
in courtroom all right fellows
now my plan is very simple
i was going to give each family ten acres a horse a cow and some seed
and if they work the farm for three years its theirs
now if thats crazy maybe i ought to be sent to an institution
but i dont think it is
and whats more mr
cedar doesnt either
vehemently just before the hearing started he offered to call the whole thing off if i made a settlement with him
so you see he wouldnt think i was crazy if he got paid off
he jumps to his feet highly incensed
its a lie
deeds is drawing on his warped imagination
as he listens to cedar watching him antagonistically
ive never heard anything so colossally stupid in my life
longfellows eyes narrow resentfully
to include longfellow cedar and judge
its an insult to our intelligence to sit here and listen to his childish ravings
throughout his speech the judge has been pounding his gavel
longfellow has his eyes levelled off on cedar
when quiet reigns you will please permit mr
deeds to finish
but your honor mr
cedar grumblingly remains standing
judge asks longfellow anything else mr
eyes still on cedar no
changes his mind turns to judge yes
theres just one more thing id like to get off my chest before i finish
thank you your honor
he rises to his feet takes one step forward and clouts cedar flush on the jaw
as cedar falls into the arms of an associate pandemonium breaks loose
order in the court
the judge pounds his gavel
there are cries of approval from the spectators
in the midst of the commotion showing spectators waiting breathlessly for a decision
all eyes are on the judge
the judge holds a whispered conversation with his experts
she is apprehensive
he glances furtively at babe off scene
their entire future hangs in the balance
the judge comes out of the huddle his face is very stern
remain seated and come to order
the court is again in session
before the court announces its decision i want to warn all who are here that the police have orders to arrest anyone creating a disturbance
of babe cobb longfellow mac the farmers
the judges preface augurs ill
his mouth curls up in a contented grimace
all eyes are upon the judge who clears his throat
serious mien mr
deeds there has been a great deal of damaging testimony against you
your behavior to say the least has been most strange
an audible gasp is heard from audience
judge goes on but in the opinion of the court you are not only sane but you are the sanest man that ever walked into this courtroom
the shout that greets this is tumultuous
the judge smiles warmly and clasps longfellows hand
immediately longfellow is surrounded by a crowd of people who come running down the aisles
they sit stunned disappointed
semple turns to her husband and slaps him
you nose twitcher
budington rises to confront cedar
oh i knew it
i knew it
you you cedar disgustedly pushes him in the face aside
she smiles ecstatically too excited to move
suddenly she rises
as babe tries to get to longfellow but finds herself on the fringe of a jubilant crowd in the center of which is longfellow
she tries to break through but finds it impossible
desperately she jumps on a chair and tries frantically to get a glimpse of him
at that moment several farmers have lifted longfellow on their shoulders
as jubilantly longfellow is carried out on the shoulders of the excited crowd
as babe frantically tries to reach longfellow but is jostled aside
the parade envelops her
the shouting mob is heading for the door at end of courtroom
everyone crowds forward
babe is left helplessly out
empty except for the falkner sisters still whispering to each other and babe sitting helpless and forlorn
her eyes are filled
dismally she starts forward
we hear a rising commotion from the outside at this moment
longfellow running toward camera with the mob shouting back of him
he reaches courtroom slams the doors shut behind him
babe attracted by the noise looks up
he runs toward her and swoops her up in his arms
hes still pixilated
he sure is
she kisses him over and over again
he looks around and over his shoulder at the mob a little dazed
finally he notices her effort and gives her one passionately back
all that is heard is the cheering of the crowd outside and the columbia music
