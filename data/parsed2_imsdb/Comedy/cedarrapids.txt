written by phil johnston june the ad depicts videotaped scenes from wisconsins north country a farmer and a cow a woman waterskiing a guy mowing his lawn
a flat nasally v
accompanies the images
the brown river valley its where we work
its where we play
its where we live
but even here in paradise accidents can happen
the ad wipes to an inappropriately gruesome photo of an obviously fatal car wreck
the narrator is chroma keyed over the image
he is roger lemke blandly charismatic with a blonde moustache that evokes a low rent tom selleck
at northlands insurance our goal is to provide high quality insurance services and related products to businesses and individuals in wisconsins northlands
im roger lemke
not only do i care about you we also endeavor to give you the coverage you need at the best prices around
its that reason northlands has been awarded the prestigious two diamond award from the american society of mutual insurers three years running
because at northlands insurance we insure your dreams
the car accident photo dissolves into a sunset
the treacly music crescendos and we the ad has been playing on a inch tv in a small wood paneled office
a handful of employees and family members applaud wildly
the proud owner of northlands bill krogstad embraces the man of the hour roger lemke
ho lee christmas knocked her outta the park roger
out of the g d park you sonofagun
cedar rapids hell im just a pretty face bill
that copy was all you
do got one little gripe though boss if youd waited until after cedar rapids we couldve said winner of the two diamonds four years running
the men roughhouse playfully
rogers comely wife gwen holding their milk fed twin toddlers gives roger a kiss
so proud of you roggie
god you rock
doesnt your dad rock boys
an elvis impersonation thank you
thank you very much
more laughter and backslapping
after a bit an as yet unseen man hesitantly approaches
he gently touches rogers arm not wanting to interrupt the revelry
didnt even know you were here
you see it bud
earnest deeply admiring oh heck yeah
you were awesome
despite appearances to the contrary this is our hero tim lippe pronounced lippy wholesome and positive though undercurrents of desperation lurk just behind his kind eyes
yknow what tim i want people to see the insurance game for what it really is its a noble field
i believe that
like i say were not just insuring vehicles and homes and that
were insuring peoples dreams
i say that too
cedar rapids well shit you do dont you
by god i stole your line
knew id heard that somewhere
oh no biggie
bummer they cut your little deal outta the ad though
got left on the ol
a female co worker interrupts accosts roger and ignores tim
look out brad pitt
the ol cutting room floor right
upon being ignored brad pitt
then with forced nonchalance whoa
tim goes to the cake table
he smiles at the cake impressed
the icing on the cake a frosted visage of roger lemke smiles back
a beige buick skylark splashes through a puddle of snow melt in the glum isolated hamlet of brown valley wi pop
tim bops his head and sings along as a parliament song plays on a good times great oldies radio station
a dour old lady shoveling her driveway stares as he passes by
the skylark pulls into the driveway of a tidy umber colored rambler with a nature scene painted on the garage door
cedar rapids flowered wallpaper
a spoon collection
the room looks like someones grandmother designed it
he opens the fridge grabs an a w root beer
he opens a cupboard removes a box of hostess cupcakes
he sits at the formica kitchen table meticulously eats the cupcake sips the soda pop and stares out the window at a bird feeder
tims bedroom looks like that of a fastidious teenager
milwaukee brewers poster circa
tim removes his penny loafers pleated khakis and northlands insurance polo shirt
he puts on a different pair of pleated khakis a maroon turtleneck and some top siders
tim enters another bedroom
this one has a four poster bed clearly a parents room clearly unused
he opens the closet
a label reads gift closet
each shelf is neatly organized toys knickknacks occasion specific greeting cards
he selects a get well card and a beanie baby duck quackers
a doorbell rings
tim hurriedly signs the card
he licks the envelope as he hustles to the door
tim opens the door to millie vanderhei a thick depressive woman dressed like a th grade science teacher
there she is
how you feeling
oh its no big whoop
tim pulls the card and beanie baby duck from behind his back
the stuffed duck quack quack
dyou already have this guy
cedar rapids gayle syrstad gave me a quackers for secret santa last year
i can probably trade with nan though
millie sits on tims paisley sofa
she opens the card
on the front a rottweiler in a nurses outfit
inside get well or you deal with me
then in tims writing love tim
chuckles at the card cute
brandy would never sit still long enough for me to dress her up like that
tell you that right now
you didnt have to do this whole rigmarole tim
i told you its just a little diarrhea
but for you to miss a day of school millie
i cant remember you ever calling in sick when i had you
well i wasnt going through menopause when you were in middle school now was i
not to my knowledge
not to my knowledge
she nods somberly
they sit there silently for a bit
does your tummy feel good enough to
they exchange a look
millie rides tim
tim palms her breasts
he still has on the maroon turtleneck
and one brown sock
their bodies make a sound like two soft thick hands apathetically applauding clap pfft clop pfft clap ffft
the twin bed squeaks disapprovingly
cedar rapids i can try and
hold it mil
bring it home
bring it home
she waggles her hips with a bit more gusto
im bringing it
that worked out well
millie and tim watch american idol
a woman sings queens youre my best friend
ooh you make me live
youre my best friend
cmon tim i cant hear
but you are babygirl
youre my best friend
the song ends
they sit quietly for a bit
yknow galen and dar krause just did a cruise to the bahamas
pretty reasonable they said price wise
mediocre jamaican accent ya mon bahama mama
its a little different i suppose a cruise
a beat then millie removes a cruise brochure from her purse
cedar rapids look im not gonna shilly shally around here tim
i found a river cruise through germany viking line real grade a
its what i want
for the honeymoon
whoa whoa whoa whoa
wheres this coming from
we agreed on wisconsin dells for the honeymoon
its what we agreed on
youve been to the dells two dozen times
roger and gwen lemke go to the dells every year
because they have children
water parks are for children
hello tommy bartletts ski sky and stage show
its not just a water park
youve never even left the state of wisconsin
barely left brown valley
whats so great about
youre missing the
we agreed on the dells
he avoids eye contact
millie takes tims chin in her hands forcing him to look at her
god rest her
your mom was my best friend
but its going on years now
you gotta grow up
you gotta let go
you gotta live a life here
im living a perfectly fine life
i dont know why youd want to
cedar rapids rock the waters or whatever
tim looks away again pouting
millie gives him a motherly hug
over her shoulder tim watches a teenager belting out que sera sera on american idol
then almost inaudibly we agreed on the dells
in black a phone rings
tim sleeps alone in his twin bed
the phone rings again
tim wakes with a start
he flips on the lamp picks up the phone hello
oh hey bill
a look of profound anguish appears on tims face
oh my gosh
the sound of a church organ playing on eagles wings fades in
in back of a packed church millie whispers with wade brodt a bald bullet shaped man
the conversation is discreet
guy had it all
everything youd ever want
yknow he flew a cessna
in his spare time
i always say people like that who live fast
they die hard
look at river phoenix
everything youd ever want
i just dont know
to do those things to yourself
who ever heard of such a thing
cedar rapids roger lemke looks peaceful in death although its hard to miss the marks on his neck left behind by the belt
tim is at the front of a long line of uneasy mourners
tim holds back tears as he gently touches the marks on lemkes neck
tim steps aside to greet the widow gwen lemke in a receiving line
the grief has left her gaunt
she appears medicated
gwen im so sorry
roger is was is a personal hero to me
he had it all
he is interrupted by bill krogstads sobs
tim reaches out to put a comforting hand on gwens shoulder but somehow ends up touching her breast instead
tim nods sadly as he removes his hand
he walks away
the drab office is brightened with week old funeral flowers and flaccid mylar sympathy balloons
tim sits across from a young couple kurt pam gambsky s in a small glassed in conference room
the couple is tense
you just dont get it kurt
aw christ pammy
hang on guys hows this sound you can both be right
pause for effect i know youre probably thinking oh an umbrella policys only for rich people
you know what i say to that
the gambskys smile comforted
tim is good at his job
cedar rapids pam kurt ive known you guys since you were little kids
so lets dont think of me as an insurance salesman
think of me as your friend who just wants to help you protect your dreams
tim glances up and sees bill krogstad staring longingly at northlands three two diamond award plaques
a beat then krogstad slams his fist through the wood paneled wall
the couple reels around upon hearing the sound
excuse me a sec
tim exits the conference room and approaches krogstad whose hand is now bleeding
dyou can i get you a napkin or something bill
know how roger used to get down there to cedar rapids
to the asmi convention
im with kurt and pam gambsky
in a cessna
a mournful beat it was all worked out
i was going to ease into retirement in july while roger transitioned into his ownership role
wait roger was going to buy northlands
all worked out
shit dione already put the down payment on a time share
branson black hills
units all over the place
cedar rapids yeah whole deal
now i got my back up against christ knows what
no lemke no buyer the wifes spending like we won the goddamn powerball
and whats worse because of the way yknow the way roger passed
krogstad chokes up
his grief is very real
so is tims
belt and the lederhosen
a nod a sigh quote unquote perverted theyre saying
like northlands has some kind of stain
oh im so goddamned tired
can i do anything to help or
krogstad hands tim a manila folder bloodying it in the process
tim gestures for his customers to hold tight
tim opens the folder reading aloud from a cover page
innovations in hog farm risk mitigation
rogers two diamond presentation for the asmi convention
i helped prepare it
we need those two diamonds more than ever tim
if im going to sell this company we need people to feel ok about the northlands brand
not getting it mm
id go myself but my daughter kayla the heavy one
she unearthed some polack to marry her
im locked into that wedding over in gladstone
cedar rapids whoa whoa wait
what are you saying
im not asking you to fill roger lemkes shoes
not gonna happen
im asking you to deliver his presentation to bring me home those two diamonds
i cant go to asmi
to cedar rapids iowa
why cant lila do it
lilas about as charismatic as a bag of hair
bill ive never
i mean ive dabbled in hog farm risk mitigation but im no pro
tim is really starting to panic
you were what when i gave you that filing job
right after your mom passed
raising yourself pretty much living all alone
and im thinking now heres a kid
heres a kid whos gonna go places
a hand on tims shoulder and then somehow you kind of just didnt
now i guess it makes some sense a child loses both parents at an early age becomes what you might call stunted
but cripes almighty do you want to just sit there in your folks old house just rot away in brown valley dating that
woman the rest of your life
millie and i are getting married
tss maybe threell be a charm
cedar rapids point is im not exactly dancing in the streets here tim but its a perception thing
you go down there to cedar rapids wholesome and pie eyed and all that
you show them that northlands is a good outfit an upstanding christian outfit
tim considers the gravity of this moment
aw cripes say youll do it
krogstad starts crying again
he hugs tim his bloody hand staining tims canary yellow v neck sweater
tim looks up to see the gambskys in the conference room staring at him
a melancholic yet uplifting song leonard cohens hallelujah perhaps plays as tim puts birdseed in his backyard feeder
he looks at the barren trees as he considers his fate
tim googles cedar rapids
he looks at photos crime statistics a chamber of commerce youtube video
he closes his eyes exhales
tim practices the presentation in front of a mirror
he works late
he power points
tim laminates maps of cedar rapids and area attractions
tim pulls a dusty american tourister suitcase from the attic
it looks about years old
tim looks pensive as he drives
hes wearing a new suit
its a little too big
a greeting card and a beanie baby rooster bounce along on the passengers seat
tim pulls up to a split level house
a pick up truck with the words brodt heating cooling is parked in the driveway
tim pokes his head into a living room surprised to see wade the ish bald guy from church reclining on a lazy boy
cedar rapids wades boots are off
his socks are dirty
hes watching espn on a tv with an olan mills portrait of tim millie atop it
oh hiya tim
millie enters in a terry cloth robe
a yorkshire terrier follows her
millie acts nonchalant
so does the dog
wades presence wades cables down
its six am
mike mike in the morning
finally to millie well i just wanted to
he displays the beanie baby and the card
she takes them with a cold smile
tim notices an identical stuffed rooster on an oak bookshelf home to over other beanie babies
you already have a strut the rooster
so this is it then
tims jetting off to cedar rapids this morning wade
big deal insurance convention
its only four days
cedar rapids wont go to germany for our honeymoon but for work you can just gallivant around like tom petty or one of them
we agreed on the dells
then to millie should we maybe talk in the
oh it dont bother me
tim tries to proceed as if wade werent sitting there
if i dont try to do this its not just my job mil
there are four other employees whose lives are on the line
plus carol who does part time seasonal work
its not for certain a new owner would even keep you guys on
no bill said hed make that part of any deal
believe you me bill krogstad is looking out for one guy
and thats bill krogstad
tim shoots wade a look
oh who am i kidding im a little scared here
a lot scared
but not about us
what weve got were like lightning in a bottle babygirl
i love you so much mil
he hugs her
millie melts just a little yet remains stern
i want you to be very careful
cedar rapids i know
i mean cedar rapids there were only four homicides last year
for a city of thousand thats pretty darn good
the forcible rape numbers are admittedly a bit higher but
she fidgets with his tie
a bitter tear skulks down her cheek
i want you to check in with me
i will every day
twice a day
make it three times
ok three times
and ill send a stinkin telegram too
tim kisses the warm tears from millies ruddy cheeks
millie licks her finger and smooths tims cowlick
wade just sits there watching
tim walks up to the tiny municipal airport
he tries the door
a retarded man shoveling snow spots tim
airport dont open for two hours
just wanna be sure i make my flight
going down to cedar rapids
the big asmi convention
the retarded man nods vacantly and goes back to shoveling
tim is the first and only person in the security line
an apathetic tsa agent awaits him
tim has a nervous energy
cedar rapids cold enough for you
im heading to cedar rapids
supposed to be up in the mid s down there
any liquids gels or aerosols must be placed in a quart size zip lock
laptop computers must be taken out of the case and placed in
whats all this now
any liquids gels or aerosols
praise christ you havent left yet
bill krogstad runs up to tim
hes out of breath
hey bill whats going on
cant believe i forgot to get this to you
hang on lemme
krogstad puts his hands on his knees takes a few deep breaths
then he hands tim a detailed handwritten checklist
its basically an asmi convention bible
its going to tell you who to talk to who to avoid how best to fellowship and network
tim glances at the list reads the only name under avoid
dean ziegler stevens point
ziegler is a cancer
sonofabitch called one of lemkes biggest clients joyce armbruster
smeared rogers name and the northlands name
avoid ziegler like the plague
the fella i got you rooming with ronald wilkes thats who you stick by
cedar rapids by zieglers name tim frantically writes poacher and armbruster making sure not to forget the umlaut
you got the presentation right
tim untucks his shirt revealing a zippered cummerbund like money belt
on me at all times
plus three back up discs
that kind of prep is pure lemke
didnt know any better id say rogers spirit had kind of climbed into you just planted its seed inside you there
high praise indeed
is now the right time
i have to ask
lets say one of these big dogs your allstates your prudentials does decide to go and buy northlands
said it before ill say it again your job the office in brown valley all safe
what you need to worry about is getting down there and representing us the best you can
thats all you need to worry about
tim swallows hard
bill brings it in for a hug and inhales tims hair
tim has a window seat
he reads the safety card
hes sweaty anxious
a vaguely swarthy man indian
hard to tell
s sits next to him
a perky flight attendant approaches
you lucky ducks are obviously seated in an exit row
cedar rapids just gotta make sure youre willing and able to assist crew members in the event of an emergency evacuation
the man smiles nonchalantly
tim tries to play it cool
youre talking what water landing
looks around whispers terror type deal
its really just a formality
believe it or not i have actually never been on an airplane before
oh well youll do awesome
takes a moment ok
if you need any help im in
the flight attendant smiles politely if confusedly
tim looks out the window watching nervously as the dairy farms and frozen lakes of northern wisconsin recede
he instinctively turns to his neighbor
they shake hands
great to meet you dave
wondering what kind of name is marinakis
cedar rapids as in dont you get lippy with me mister
my grandma used to say that
before she passed
lot of people pronounce it lip
course the high germans probably more like lipp uh
david marinakis nods goes back to his book seemingly shutting down the conversation
tim settles in
tim hesitates before stepping onto the jetway one small step for man and just like that hes in iowa
tim helps david marinakis take his bag off the carousel
like i say dave its not life insurance so much as it is dream insurance
its a good way of looking at it
i think so
tim hands david his card who takes it with a genuine smile
let me know how things go with your alltel deal dave
e mail me
will do tim
tim stands there waving
tim emerges from an elevator on the roof of a parking garage
he inhales the chilly iowa air
he glances at his rental agreement and spots his car a red chevy cobalt
as he approaches the car he stops
he chuckles in awe
cedar rapids holy crap
in the distance the cedar rapids skyline looms its tallest building the alliant tower stretching stories into the cloudy sky
tim snaps a photo with his cell phone
the holidome sign reads welcome asmi participants
tim gets out of the rental car
he looks around not too shabby
but upon spotting a sikh cabbie in a turban tim straightens up and cautiously adjusts his money cummerbund
as he walks toward the entrance a pretty but gaunt young woman in a short denim skirt bree approaches him
hey man can i bum a heater
whats that now
oh im like this gal wants to borrow my heater
but no sorry cant help you there
you here for the convention
how bout yourself
they shake hands
well bree its nice to meet you
but let me give you a trade secret
keep smoking and your premiums will go through the roof
they laugh then
cedar rapids if you want to party tim let me know
ill be around
nice chatting with you bree
people are so friendly
tim enters the hotel
tim walks in
he strolls atop the velvety green carpet past a fountain beneath a golden colored chandelier and makes his way to the front desk blown away
an apple cheeked clerk whose name tag reads trent greets him
checking in with us sir
you tell me
never done the hotel deal before
ill just need to see a credit card for the incidentals
reads the name tag trent i was given the impression that you honored travelers checks
yes we just need an imprint of your card
for the incidentals
travelers check is a fully insured method of yknow
im aware of that sir
we wont charge the card unless you rent a movie or take something from the mini bar
im a non drinker
its standard sir
cedar rapids tim eyes trent cautiously as he unzips his cummerbund money belt
he removes a credit card and reluctantly hands it over
cell phone to his ear tim struggles with his bag as he walks to his room
have you seen the pool yet
not yet but i can smell it
its a super top notch place mil
youd be blown away
im at mi casa
lemme see how this deal works
he examines the card key
he slides it in
it doesnt work
each time he fails it beeps
keys like a stinkin credit card
suddenly the door opens
and standing before tim is a black man
tim gasps drops his suitcase backs away
to the man oh jeez
turns whispers into phone theres an afro american gentleman in this room
well get the heck outta there
tim turns back and smiles frightened
the man looks confused
run like hell tim
are you tim
tim just smiles a wide deer in headlights smile
im ronald wilkes
bill krogstad said we were gonna be roommates
cedar rapids ronald wilkes is conservative in dress and demeanor
let me call you back mil
tim clicks off his phone just stares at ronald
you are tim
for a minute there i was like whoa im gonna be robbed here or
tim laughs loudly
ronald just looks at tim
just super great to meet you ronald
tim shakes ronalds hand holds onto it for at least two seconds too long
you want to check out the room then
ronald leads tim into the room a junior suite with two beds a kitchenette and a couch in the separate living room area
check out these digs
yeah you could do a lot worse
a serious beat look tim i gotta put the cards on the table here
the reason we got the junior suite upgrade is because the hotel overbooked wedding or some such
point being they were asking folks to take on a third roommate to consolidate space
now to me being an independent owner the savings of adding a third guy sounded like a real positive
cedar rapids but if youve got any qualms i hear you l c thats loud clear
ronald has undoubtedly been called a nerd more than once
to tim however he is the embodiment of cool and hilarity
down with that
any idea who were gonna be chilling with roommate wise
just hope he doesnt snore
can you imagine
or someone who has terrible gas
like pull my finger
hello no thanks
tim is giddy like a kid away at camp for the first time
this isnt woodstock tim
its a regional insurance convention
whoever it is im sure hell be a straight shooter
a pair of massive scuffed wing tips walk determinedly down the hall
we dont see the man they belong to but we most definitely hear him as he passes various convention goers
hey taco bill am i gonna see you at horizons tonight
i hear they got their all you care to eat pussy buffet going
a booming laugh follows as the feet continue down the hall
tim admires ronalds laptop
the screen saver is a photo of a billboard advertising ronald wilkes insurance
a picture of a stoic looking ronald is the centerpiece of the billboard along with the slogan your insurance professional
cedar rapids so far its just the one billboard north of st
course the traffic load would get me more eyeballs in the twin cities corridor but at the end of the day its n t s
not too shabby
n t s
id love to own my own agency
the door bursts open
we boom up from the scuffed wing tips to reveal dean ziegler whose massive personality just barely hides an undercurrent of sadness and insecurity
baroo baroo lets get this party started you mother rubbers
ronald deflates upon seeing dean
he clearly knows him
no fucking way
gimme some love uh my soul broth uh
dean gives ronald a bear hug lifts him off the ground
turn down the volume ziegler
you just got here for petes sake
tim looks like someone deciding which direction to run from an oncoming tornado
dean notices tims look
whats the matter friend never seen a chocolate vanilla love sandwich
wait until later when we get to the buttfucking
nah im having fun
stevens point wisconsin
tim discreetly looks at the checklist krogstad gave him
under avoid it says dean ziegler
dont worry i wont bite
but i should be
so whats your handle pal
cedar rapids we drew the short straw with this pitiful reprobate tim
dean this is tim lippe
call me deanzie
where you hail from tim lippe
i do not
im down from brown valley wisconsin
bill krogstads outfit
beat dials it way down aw shit
i was sorry as hell to hear about lemkes passing up there
that guy was tits as a rep
course he thought i was a big loud asshole spose he wasnt too far off there
no boy a real tragedy
roger was just a super great man
hell be in my prayers
his family too
all three nod
a moment of solemn silence
i dont know about you wingnuts but the deanzie could use a drinkzie
what say we blow off the welcome hoo ha and hit horizons for happy hour
two for one cocktails cent wings and an all you care to eat pussy buffet
that line was unappealing last year dean
it remains so now
im planning to watch president helgessons opening remarks
cedar rapids oh dont get me started on that smug fuck
orin helgesson is a pardon my french a cunt
just a steaming wet dog cunt
tim stands there slack jawed this man is evil
no ones buying the potty mouth nonsense youre selling dean
tim youll learn to ignore this degenerate before too long
lets go hear what orin has to say
have fun ladies
tim and ronald exit
dean cant handle the momentary silence
as he lugs his suitcase into the bedroom party time
orin helgesson a gentle avuncular man with a mr
rogers persona addresses a crowd
a banner reading asmi lets build a bridge to the nd century
hangs above the podium
im orin helgesson your asmi midwest region chapter president
but im not going to make you play hail to the chief
not yet anyhow
polite laughter from the or so mostly male insurance workers congregated in the sunset terrace ballroom which has neither a terrace nor a window through which to view a sunset
seriously weve got a great line up for asmi with our forward looking theme lets build a bridge to the nd century
just so many innovations our newsletter the asmi teer is now fully digital
so a lot of our breakout sessions will be dealing with this kind of e commerce sort of thing
pause for polite applause
cedar rapids if you didnt pick up your welcome kits be sure and see mike pyle the gentleman in the what colors that sweater vest mike
mike pyle a round milky skinned man who favors sweater vests raises his hand
hes seated near tim and ronald
in the beige sweater vest
orin continues o
but we stay with tim and ronald
im worried about this deanzie guy
bill krogstad told me specifically to stay the heck away from him
oh dean ran for president against orin last year only got four votes
hes running again this year
hes just full of bluster
tim looks deeply concerned
back on orin
the two diamonds are given every year to the agency that best exemplifies the asmi decree to provide high quality insurance services and related products while maintaining commitment to community
country and god
we have a record number of entries this year over agencies competing
good luck to you all
tim eyes go wide did he say over agencies
did he say over agencies
yeah its gonna be brutal this year
i brought my a game though
cedar rapids heck yeah
its the first year ive ever had a real shot
but the guy you really have to worry about is mike pyle
he owns the sixth largest allstate agency in the upper midwest
the guys a shark
tim looks at mike pyle the bland looking man in the sweater vest
tims confidence is waning
back on orin moment of silence for the man many considered to be the michael jordan of mutual insurance agents
orin places a x foot poster of roger lemke on an easel
a period of mournful reflection follows
until orin breaks out in song were you there
a somber hymn
were you there when they crucified my lord
were you there when they crucified my lord
tim looks around nervously as the entire room joins in song
tim paces cell phone to his ear
i need to talk to you mil
im in over my head here
i feel like i cant even swim
it was fun at first but now its like i dunno
i need you so bad babygirl
a mans voice picks up on the other end
millies in the john
cedar rapids are
youre at millies still
badger hockeys on
my cables out
you want her to give you a ring when shes off the john
and just would you tell her i love her very much
you got it bud
tim shuts his eyes for a moment be strong
tim in shorts tube socks and a very old milwaukee bucks tank top reads the diagram for the chest press machine
he gives it a try lifting about pounds
the only other person in the room is a woman on a treadmill
tim glances her way and by chance they make eye contact in the mirror
he immediately looks at the floor
we stay on tim lifting weights eyes to the ground
but we hear the treadmill stop
finally tim looks up to find you were checking me out
mortified tim drops the weights
they crash to their base
im gonna have to tell the hotel theres a pervo in the fitness center hitting on innocent women
im sorry if you
i have a fiance
that poor woman should know what youre up to
no no no please
the woman cant keep it in
she starts laughing
cedar rapids i am so sorry
im totally messing with you
god im a jerk
that was different
yes you are
im so sorry
joan ostrowski fox
joan ostrowski fox middle management sexy if slightly too tan puts out her hand
tim shakes it
dont get lippy with me mister
tim is taken aback by this
joan notices tims outfit
so do you play professional basketball tim
because thats a pretty updated uniform there
no i dont
im actually in town for the asmi convention
oh is that where a bunch of guys sit around a table looking up the word gullible in a dictionary
no its an association of insur
youre screwing with me again
indeed i am
im here for asmi too
in from oh my god nebraska
just kidding omaha
wipes off some sweat ugh i am gross so im going to bid you farewell tim lippe
see you at horizons tonight
cedar rapids unless you were planning on spying on me in the shower
tim reddens once again going into panic mode
god i am evil
i need help
tim tries to think of something clever to say but just sits there with his mouth open
hes never met a woman like this
tim finishes showering
he steps out of the shower to find orin helgesson completely naked
orin has just exited another shower
he smiles pleasantly at tim also naked
how ya doin
i really enjoyed your speech president helgesson
you were in there
did you like the part about e commerce
very much sir
its the future yknow
anyhow i dont think weve
down from brown valley wisconsin
a flash of emotion maybe even anxiety on orins face
tim what can i say
i just were all feeling it
im so sorry for the loss
orin puts a supportive hand on tims shoulder
cedar rapids um well its rough
like you said in your remarks roger wasnt just a great rep he was a good father and
and a pilot
flew a cessna
its just rough
come here son
orin gives tim a hug
tim juts his butt out so that their penises dont touch
a janitor enters the locker room sees this odd embrace pauses a beat and hurriedly exits
the embrace runs its course
tim isnt sure where to look
tim i know bills looking to retire and from the sound of it hes on the hook for a pretty sweet time share
yeah it sounds pretty top notch
i want to help him find a buyer and god knows ill try my darnedest
but and it pains me to say this theres a petition going around trying to rescind all of northlands two diamond awards
but lets be honest one of the core tenets of the two diamonds is commitment to god
and the way roger passed on
well some folks are saying that type of activity isnt entirely godly
tim shakes his head disbelieving
cedar rapids you have to understand this isnt some namby pamby local event
this is a regional convention tim
now i want to help you but youre going to have to help yourself too
orin goes to his locker removes a folder

let em see the good side of northlands insurance the wholesome side ok
thank you president helgesson
and if you need anything tim i mean anything im up in the tiffany suite
balcony overlooks the pool
tim accepts the stack of drink tickets
hes scared shitless
tim with taupe turtleneck tucked in to pleated corduroys hesitates at the threshold of horizons a brightly lit aeronautically themed establishment
the cavernous bar is largely empty
tim considers his drink coupons

dean sits alone at the bar
tim reluctantly goes to him

view of the pool
leans in conspiratorial cocksuckers buying your vote pal
cedar rapids tim shudders
dean gestures for tim to act natural as ronald enters with a taciturn latino man bill hernandez
i call him taco bill
lubricated insurance workers are now singing karaoke
orin and mike pyle the sweater vest guy sit at a table in back
orin looks at tim with concern as dean regales him
so big time tim whatre you looking for pussy wise here in cedar crapids
ah that would be nothing
tim displays a photo of millie a portrait from the junior high where she teaches in his wallet
that your mom
no it is not
millie and i are engaged
to be married
youre married yourself ziegler

my moral compass is pointing true north if you read me

taco bill sighs and wanders off to get a drink
and by the way ronimal i was married
you and patti split
sorry to hear that
barely covering the pain ah shes a fucking asshole
cedar rapids together years
lucky if one of em was decent
its a weird moment
dean takes a drink laughs it off
what i was talking about anyway ronimal is that from what i can deduce young timbo lippe here has led a shall i say sheltered existence
and i think we oughta help him yknow aroo aroo
dean raises his drink heroically
no one else joins him
asmi isnt a vacation for everybody dean
end of the day tims here to work and to win
for his agency
and p s i would never ever have relations or whatever with another woman
as fate that wily minx would have it
hubba hubba check out these studs
its joan ostrowski fox the woman tim met in the gym
dean and ronald get up greet her warmly
tim looks at his soda
joan ostrowski fox
the o fox
joan does an ironic flirtatious curtsy

ronald giggles more animated than weve seen him
cedar rapids no not really

tim stares ahead wishing for invisibility

from the fitness center

im sorry about that tim

the peer pressure
tim scans the liquor behind the bar settles on a bottle that looks impressive
cedar rapids ah
joan ronald and dean wince as they slam their shots
tim sips the thick red syrup surprised by its sweetness
careful you dont get too loaded lippe or i might have to take advantage of you
joan squeezes tims thigh
tim bolts off of his stool
its been a super long day
i ah better
tim awkwardly leaves the bar
dean nudges joan
sings hall oates whoa o here she comes shes a man eater
as tim hurries out of the bar bree the woman in the denim skirt who tim met outside enters
shes locking arms with a stout insurer
tim pauses long enough to say hi
with that tim is gone
millie is on the phone in her bathrobe
her dog sits with her
marlenes brothers back in the hospital so bridge got canceled
so we just watched hockey
cedar rapids wade is still there watching tv
hes drinking a beer
me and wade
tim sits on a roll away bed in his pajamas
hes on his cell
he says hey
tell him hey
tim says hey
a beat of silence
tim looks irritated
i picked up that diet wet food for brandy today
i have to do some work before bed so
well i should let you go
no its i love you so bad babygirl
its so hard here
i just miss you
i miss you too tim
but this was your decision
you have to act like a big boy now
keep reminding me
youll be fine
just be careful
i love you
cedar rapids tim hangs up world weary
tim sits on the toilet
his laptop sits on the counter the two diamond presentation on the screen
he practices for the full length mirror on back of the bathroom door
current risk mitigation mechanisms available to hog farm operations include futures and options to
the bathroom door opens
im in here
this needs to be private
something didnt agree with you did it
second thought meet me in the stairwell after you wrap things up in here
deanzie sips from a mini bar bottle of rum as tim now in a flannel bathrobe and slippers enters the dingy stairwell
what the heck is going on here
you sound like my fuckin wife timbo
ex i should say
dean sits heavily on the cement stairs
he hiccups burps
tim looks at dean with a feeling that borders pity
are you drunk
calms himself whispers fuck yeah
but we didnt get to finish our little confab back at the bar
i figured some shit out
cedar rapids like i told you no shocker helgessons buttering you up to get you in his camp because he knows you and me are close
were not close
youre voting for me for president right
no im not
well anyway theres a petition going around trying to take away your companys two diamond awards
well hear this after you left the bar mike pyle comes up to me pyle of shit i call him and he asks do i want to sign this thing
and i go lemke might have been a class a deviant but the guy was tits as a rep
pardon my french dean but thats a bunch of bull roar
my boss bill krogstad
he told me how you called up joyce armbruster and smeared rogers name all over town
oh no no no whoa whoa whoa that old whore called me
harping about lemke being a pervert and how she wants to take her business elsewhere
so i says ok ill run some numbers
well she calls back later that same day says she got krogstad to lower her premium
which is all the greasy twat wanted in the first place
so wait you didnt call her
cedar rapids i may be a lot of things but poacher aint one of em
tim lets this sink in
dean hiccups and burps again
so whats with this petition
i think mike pyle of shit started the thing as a way to drive down the price of your agency
dollars to donuts he wants to swoop in and pick up northlands at a bargain basement price
and you know what else i think
i think orins in on the deal somehow
i cant quite figure it myself but i know what i know
and what i know is youre wading into some duvious er dubious shit
just be careful
tim looks shell shocked
what a long long day its been
in joan ostrowski foxs room joan is bent over her tub applying a clairol nice n easy home hair color kit
she gets up puts on a shower cap
she applies cold cream to her face
she looks tired and decidedly middle aged
in the hallway bree drunkenly escorts a different insurer back to his room
in the junior suite bedroom ronald sleeps soundly gently snoring
tim tosses and turns in his cot
he looks out into the living room where he sees deanzie at the desk chair gently masturbating
we move in to see what hes looking at a photo of a woman in a bikini
shes attractive enough carrying a few too many pounds
certainly no supermodel
pull out to reveal
cedar rapids the woman is the subject of a christmas photo card
the typed script reads happy holidays from dean patti ziegler
christmas panama city beach fla
next to the woman stands a younger slimmer deanzie
tim holds hands with ronald and a doughy man at a round table in a room full of people holding hands
orin says a prayer
in your name we pray lord jesus son of god author of our salvation our redeemer our truth
the gathered insurers head to the breakfast buffet
orin knows how to lead a prayer breakfast tell you what
hello thank you
i feel like my head is gonna like
makes explosion face yknow
oh i hear ya l c
loud and clear
i was the same way when i first came to asmi
the deciding which break out sessions to attend plus the politics the pressure the not knowing who to trust
orin catches tims eye gives him a friendly wink
just then tims phone rings
he looks at the caller id
excuse me ronald
its my boss
this is tim
cedar rapids bill krogstad talks on the phone as he drives
his wife dione crochets in the passengers seat
got a call from orin helgesson
tells me hes worried about you
tells me youre palling around with dean ziegler
laughing at his jokes buying him drinks
whats the one thing i told you to do
the one thing tim
steer clear of dean ziegler
goddamnit youre lousing the whole thing up
not now dione
tim tries to get a word in
that dean ziegler he was trying to warn me about orin
warn you about orin
orin helgesson has been asmi midwest region president for years
he is a legend
and what do you do
you go and pal around with his sworn enemy who p
is a drunken loser
bill im sorry
krogstad punches the car roof
cedar rapids i sent you to asmi to restore our image tim
one day into the deal youre lousing the whole thing up
see how far gladstone is from cedar rapids dione
look in the atlas
youre not driving to iowa bill
this is your daughters wedding
oh cripes you know as well as i do that polacks gonna head for the hills the second he gets his papers
but no you want to end up in the poor house dione well go
lets just keep on cashing checks we dont have
we are going to our daughters wedding bill
tim deflates actually fighting back tears
i didnt know i did anything wrong
well you better try doing something right lippe
because if you keep lousing up we all by god starve
and dont you tell me to calm down dione
krogstad hangs up
rattled tim hurries for the exit
he gets in the revolving door when he spots joan ostrowski fox outside having a cigarette
rather than face her tim keeps going in the revolving door
but she sees him and waves
tim does one more turn in the revolving door and steps out
im a very bad girl
but i swear i only smoke in cedar rapids
care for a virginia slim lippe
cedar rapids tim just shakes his head unable to hide his despondence
whoa whats wrong
mm i dont know
joan gives him a kind gentle smile
tim and joan swing on a swing set in a dreary little park overlooking the cedar river
it is a cold gray day
he didnt have to yell at me
i didnt do anything wrong
im trying my hardest
dyou want me to kick his butt
i know krogstad
i could take him
sides im a ninja
a nin jette actually
so lippe howd you end up in the insurance game
god that sounded dorky insurance game
does s style cagney look here see howd you end up in the insurance game see
you are freaky
laughs then no its kind of weird how i got interested in insurance actually
when i was six my dad got killed in a sawmill accident
oh my god
cedar rapids yeah
but after he died our insurance agent fought like a tiger against the sawmill to make sure me and my mom were taken care of
and we were
the crazy thing our agent was actually bill krogstad
he had just opened northlands
anyway i remember thinking this guys a hero
a real hero
so even if he doesnt always treat me like yknow
whatever now ill never forget that
tim jumps off the swing taking care not to slip in the snow
joan jumps off
they walk toward the river silent for a bit
this river the cedar river
it flooded the whole city a couple years ago
i remember that
people talk about the firemen and policemen and that
but think about all the claims in a disaster like that how hard those agents worked to make sure peoples lives werent left in the lurch
were talking billions of dollars in damages literally
and claim by claim dream by dream those agents helped rebuild this city
im telling you its a noble calling
i really believe that
you realize you just made it sound cool to be an insurance salesman
you are a hero lippe
cedar rapids no i can tell
youre the superman type
kind of dweeby on the surface but a real frickin stud underneath
theyd call you insurance man put a big red i on your chest
well even if youre being full of it thanks for saying that anyway
well youre welcome
so can you fly me back to the hotel insurance man
im freezing my arse off
he laughs sufficiently cheered up
she snaps her fingers and starts heading back
dean and orin argue
ronald tries to stay out of it
im saying a bridge to the nd century is a stupid theme helgesson
not a goddamn one of us is even going to be alive in the nd century
oh and i suppose under a dean ziegler administration wed just abandon e commerce and all that huh
whats your take ronald
end of the day you know im a big supporter of yours orin
stab me in the fucking back why dont you wilkes
why would i stab you in the back dean when im telling you to your face that i think youd be a lousy president
cedar rapids that deflates the tension
the three men are laughing as tim approaches
dean spots him first
sorry about that gigantic boner i got while we were spooning
tim freezes looks at orin
we didnt spoon orin
to each his own tim
gives tim a kind wink im teasing of course
well i gotta run to an executive council meeting
you fellas really ought to check out mike pyles prop cas seminar
pyle of shit
mikes a dynamite orator
i think youd enjoy it
well see ya
orin walks away
then to tim ronald so whos ready for a drink
its in the morning
its in the morning
can you believe this guy
cmon timbo lets get the flock outta here
you need to leave me alone
dean and ronald watch curiously as tim practically runs away
cedar rapids tim ronald and joan sit on folding chairs in the front row
mike pyle his creamy skin offset by an aquamarine sweater vest speaks with subdued energy to the half full room
id like to share a humorous anecdote
a gentleman is drowning in a lake or pond and hes feet offshore
well along comes an actuary
and this actuary sees the drowning gentleman and throws him an foot rope
and the gentleman says but im feet offshore
and the actuary says well im meeting you more than halfway
the room busts up laughing
tim takes notes
so property casualty insurance or prop cas its one of the most dynamic areas of our industry
mike pyle pauses as a hotel clerk enters whispers something to him and hands him a note
mike reads the note
ah is there a tim lip in here
theres an emergency call
tim looks concerned as he rises
tim takes the phone from the desk clerk
tim my name chin chang
there bad news about your fiance
ah you wise man mr
she die in horrible car accident
cedar rapids tims stomach drops
but her dying wish for you mr
tim to get shit face with deanzie
whip pan to reveal dean on another house phone
tim turns sees dean
a torrent of anger rises
tim charges at dean
he shoves him
dean is a much larger man and is therefore impervious to tims inelegant girlish assault
despite the low key nature of the melee it draws the attention of trent the desk clerk
i will call security
he gives dean one more shove
what the h did i ever do to you you a hole
tim walks away
dean calls after him
come on bud i was having fun
tim sits on his cot
he is on his cell phone
i just wanted to hear your voice
sorry shes giving me grief over this new wet food
what did you need now tim
well i for one feel like i ought to be on the fire department im putting out so many fires
lucy kofnetka asked me to do altar guild for her
cedar rapids oh
patti told me lucys seeing some guy who doesnt even go to church so she apparently feels no need to maintain her responsibil
shes going number two on the floor
you get outside
ill call you later tim
he hangs up
he looks out the window an applebees
a super target
traffic on the distant interstate
something is bubbling in tim maybe not cauldron of lava more like a cup of soup left in the microwave a bit too long
but still theres a boiling churning glow behind his eyes
tim determinedly enters a banquet room where vendors have set up booths
he approaches a woman at a table with a sign that says met life scavenger hunt
id like to sign up for the scavenger hunt
teaming with a co worker or are you in need of a partner
off tims look this is a team event like the amazing race
but instead of going around the world you look for stuff in cedar rapids
and instead of a million dollars the winning team gets a gift card for westdale which is
eastern iowas largest two story mall
a thought a moment and yes i do have a teammate
ronald and joan exit the seminar
they spot tim
cedar rapids everything ok
yeah what was that call
say joan you have something on your blouse
joan looks down at her blouse
tim flicks her chin
you are very weird
bad elvis impersonation thank you
thank you very much
so ah i signed you up for the scavenger hunt
to be my teammate
in the scavenger hunt
uh well i
because ronald already had a teammate
and i thought youd wed be yknow a decent team
then firm i think you should do it
i get to be insurance mans sidekick
were going to kick some ass
a few people look curiously at joan
tim stands up a bit straighter
this is good
this is good
cedar rapids orin in a theme appropriate safari hat addresses the teams
among them tim joan ronald taco bill mike pyle a frizzy haired woman
dean is absent
like last year therell be a few physical challenges
i am super pumped
course this should be considered a fun event in the spirit of team building
you can find your first clue under the sea
by which i mean in the pool area
so ready set race
as the teams take off for the pool dean enters
tim pauses long enough to say youre going down a hole
just then deans partner a man in an electric wheelchair perry kuhn rolls in
they high five and whoo hoo
lets roll perry perry plegic
get it like paraplegic
good one dean tard
like retard but dean tard
dean laughs as he and perry follow the other contestants
the pool is large and reasonably impressive with a slide lawn furniture a whirlpool and a video arcade nearby
the contestants rush in
tim spots something on the bottom of the pool
a series of bricks spell out planet x
cedar rapids check it out planet x
tim unzips his hidden cummerbund money belt
he pulls out a small laminated packet held together with metal rings
i compiled a ton of info on cedar rapids
ive got a sweet laminator in my basement
ooh thats hot
flips through his packet maps area attractions crime stats local customs
look at you
right here planet x family fun center
joan cracks up
they walk out casually
for good measure what a gyp
there are no stinkin clues in here
tim and joan laugh as he peels out of the parking lot
ok i think were going to want to take blairs ferry road to avenue c then probably east on
why would you possibly know that
i memorized the major thoroughfares and landmarks in the metro area
rather than say anything joan just shakes her head and turns on the radio
groove is in the heart kicks in providing a
cedar rapids tim joan and the other teams bound through a huge martian themed ball pit
they start digging through the balls
perry sits dejectedly off to the side in his wheelchair
tim and ronald shove past mike pyle knocking him down
tim is the first to discover a foam moon rock amid the balls
the rock reads asmi rocks
taped to the bottom a message youve seen the future now czech out cedar rapids past
but its czech like czechoslovakia
at the national czech museum a traditionally costumed czech woman shows tim and joan how to paint an egg
the egg is lovely with intricate patterns and vibrant colors
in the car joan reads through tims laminated booklet as he drives
shes really getting into it too
tims phone keeps ringing
he ignores it
in a gymnasium ronald awkwardly tries to make a basket becomes upset when he misses
joan swishes a pointer
at a dairy farm the teams milk cows
mike pyle is particularly proficient
dean cant help himself
know what that cows thinking pyle
shes thinking quit pulling on my tits and fuck me already
in a parking lot dean loads perry into a handicap accessible van as mike pyle and his partner blow past them
at the iowa pork shrine joan gobbles down hot dogs in a speed eating contest
tim cheers her on
im gonna puke
no youre doing great joan
and you look super awesome with a wiener in your mouth
cedar rapids stunned mouth full oh my god did you just make a dick joke lippe
giggles with pride maybe
joan bites seductively into her hot dog
the others are close behind
except ronalds partner taco bill who is vomiting
the sun is low
long phallic shadows are cast by a series of foot silos which are covered with thick sheets of ice
tim and joan run up to orin who is waiting by the silos
ok guys this is it
first team to complete this challenge wins the whole shootin match
unfurls a scroll reads asmis past is behind us but our future looks nice lets build a bridge to the nd century
by scaling this silo of ice
some dudes with ice climbing equipment ropes picks etc
tim looks petrified
joan shakes her head
that doesnt even
theres no such thing as silo ice climbing
no its actually a big thing in iowa
abc news did a story about it
i saw it on youtube
of course you did
well you can do it then
uh uh absolutely not
im scared crapless of heights
you need to get over it lippe cuz im not climbing jack
cedar rapids come on insurance man leap tall buildings in a single bound and all that
tims nostrils flair
just then mike pyle and his partner arrive
tim looks to the top of the silo
it is dizzyingly high
he shuts his eyes for a moment exhales
lets do this thing
orin turns on a boom box which blasts some triumphant music whitesnakes here i go again perhaps
quick cuts the dudes get tim and mike pyle into their climbing gear harnesses helmets crampons
and they start climbing
tim jams his pick into the ice
he tries to pull himself up but cant
mike fares worse
he cant even get his pick to stick in the ice
little help here
the dudes shout instructions
tim and mike try again
to no avail
neither could do a pull up if his life depended on it
all the contestants have shown up
but not a damn one of them can get more than a foot off the ground
this is frickin hard
i think i just shit my pants
orin looks to the dudes who shrug
orin talks on his cell phone conferring
the contestants wait in a field shivering
the sun is getting lower
orin hangs up sighs shuts off the uplifting music
cedar rapids ok gang that was rick martini with the national chapter
heres the deal
since no one could do the final task and since joan and tim were the first team to get here were just gonna go ahead and award them the first
unless anyones got a problem with that
ronald mutters to himself frustrated with his performance
you couldve done better wilkes
wait we won
so here you guys go
your gift card for the westdale mall
orin hands joan the gift card
despite the anticlimax tim is overjoyed
he picks up joan and spins her around
everyone else just wanders away
tim is ebullient
joan rides shotgun
the screen on tims phone says that hes missed calls
it rings again
i have been trying to reach you for the last eight hours timothy
i was going to call the police
where have you been
im sorry mil
i signed up for this scavenger hunt and check it out we won
my teammate and i that is
cedar rapids that was joan saying hi
beat to joan millie says hi
i did not say hi
i didnt say anything
if you had asked i would have told you that ive been at the vet half the day because brandy swallowed a pencil eraser
something dawns on tim who gives a shit
he glances at joan and her skirt and her exposed knee
lucky for us it came out naturally or wed have been looking at surgery
tim pulls into a spot in the westdale mall parking lot
he gestures for joan to wait a second
ill just meet you inside
sorry mil go ahead
millie looks wounded
so whos this joan
tim gets out of the car
just some gal from omaha they paired me up with
between you and me shes a little different
real hyper one of these types who kind of overdoes it
but for a dollar gift card im not going to complain
cedar rapids you promised youd check in with me
im very disappointed
its as though a profound revelation has just slipped out
as if in an instant everything has changed
millies heart sinks
she looks at her beanie babies
you obviously have more important things to do than talk to me
my brother and i were just getting ready to go for fish at the eagles anyhow
reveal wade is sitting in his rightful throne watching an aerobics show on tv
millie snaps at him
go warm up the car wade
mil i didnt
youll call me some time when its convenient for you tim
millie hangs up
wade gives her a supportive shrug
tim snaps his phone shut
what just happened
he considers his options for a moment
joan window shops at a lenscrafters
tim approaches her
what say we just use the gift certificate to get a nice supper here
at the mall
cedar rapids joan smiles at him and we tim approaches the olive garden maitre d
we have a gift card
but i didnt make a reservation
is that ok
save for three tables of elderly people the place is empty
right this way sir
tim raises his eyebrows to joan not too shabby
tim and joan are seated in a candlelit booth
opera muzak tinkles
if you didnt know this to be a mall based chain you might think it a romantic italian restaurant
an acne scarred waiter approaches with a tray
coors lite for the madam
a cream sherry for monsieur
and here are some bottomless bread sticks
the waiter exits
tim raises his glass for a toast
to new friends
and all the joys of living it
thats really nice
they clink glasses
tim takes a dainty sip of his sherry
mm it does taste a lot like communion wine
cedar rapids joan feeds tim a bite of her lasagna
a bit sticks to his chin
she wipes it off semi seductively
so lippe im trying to figure you out
hopes dreams aspirations blah blah blah
i would love some day to put a little greenhouse in my backyard
dream the impossible dream
no ive actually seen some fairly decent portable ones at fleet farm that wont break the bank
i mean fantasy land stuff
what do you really want
he takes a sip of sherry shrugs
i always hoped i could take over northlands when bill retired
but that obviously isnt going to happen now
oh screw him
he wants to sell why dont you just buy northlands
you could get a loan
you know the business
you know the clients
you actually care about your job
youd be perfect
cedar rapids grrrr
what id really like is a family
to be a dad
so kids i guess thats what i really want
yeah well you can have mine
youve got kids
joan takes out her blackberry
the screensaver is a family portrait joan a man with a goatee and two cute kids
all of them are dressed in denim
ashleyll be eight next month
my little squirrels
we met when we were both rotary exchange students in high school
lived in norway for a semester
i was such a spaz
band geek total ugly duckling braces acne the whole nine
i didnt even get boobs until college
anyway we ended up getting married sophomore year
then blah blah blah and here we are
richies a supervisor in the parks department now
for the county
tim doesnt hide his shock well
joan sees it
i know its effed up
and if i had it all to do over again i dont know what id choose
cedar rapids but i dont have that option
so this is my fantasy land tim
i come here and for a few days im someone else
an ironic growl sometimes a gal just needs a vacation from who she really is know what i mean lippe
tim nods but looks more confused than ever
the olive garden doggie bag sits in joans lap
silence other than the radio
after a bit ok
i thought of another one
or dream or whatever
its still small potatoes compared to
no lets hear it
to all youve done norway and all that but
do you watch american idol ever
you wanna be on american idol
no no no
but i do enjoy watching it quite a bit
randys always like thats awesome dawg
and simons such a mediocre british accent oh im so superior
anyhow i was thinking of maybe trying trying to get a solo in my choir
i mean its all super political
but im a fair to middlin baritone so
cedar rapids he shrugs
joan fights her instinct to tease him
thats great tim
youll do it
i know you will
he shrugs again but now hes grinning from ear to ear
tim yawns as he and joan enter the lobby
wanna get one for the road stud
oh no i have to practice my two diamond presentation
itll loosen you up
tim looks at the ground
he looks up tries to make a joke
kneecap more like
she looks at him oddly as he charges ahead to the bar
taco bill sings dont stop believing on the karaoke stage
bree wearing a new denim skirt grinds on the dance floor with yet another insurer
dean watches the action
timbo and the o fox
wondered when you crazy kids were gonna show up
he ushers them to the bar where ronald is seated
can i buy the big shot winners a drink
coors lite for joan
and tim you want a pop
cedar rapids actually do they have cream sherry
jeez guess that victory really did go to your head
coors lites good for me thanks

dean laughs heartily
its a deeply uncomfortable moment

cedar rapids to tim the young rookie comes in takes the scavenger hunt

tim has finished his sherry
the bartender pours a second glass
tim wears the shit eating grin of a first time drunk
would you rather toss a bums salad yknow eat out his butthole or
give your dad a b j
come on ziegler this is supposed to be a clean game

tim laughs hysterically
which makes everyone else laugh

joan passes tim the shot
he slams it
the room applauds as tim nervously makes his way to the stage
tim confers with the dj
the dj nods cues up the song
tim gives joan a look of mock anger as he takes the mic
i um ive met some really just super neat people here
but this song id like to dedicate to the first african american person ive ever met
i mean ive seen guys at the oneida mall in rhinelander said hello and that
anyway i just think youre one of the most awesome guys around
tim gives ronald a thumbs up
ronald returns the gesture as the opening bars of clarence carters patches kick in
note patches is an extremely sentimental soul song about a poor black kid named patches
the first verse is spoken word
reading off the screen i was born and raised down in alabama
on a farm way back up in the woods
i was so ragged that folks used to call me patches
papa used to tease me about it
but deep down inside he was hurt cause hed done all he could
joan and dean whoo hoo
breaks into song very soulful my papa was a great old man
i can see him with a shovel in his hands
see education he never had he did wonders when the times got bad
the little money from the crops he raised barely paid the bills we made
joan and dean rush to the dance floor
ronald remains on his bar stool but bops his head politely
tim tears it up
patches continues creating a
cedar rapids tim drinks more sherry
the gang laughs having a blast
ronald tries to excuse himself
the presentations in hours
i cant afford to be off my game
frankly neither can you tim
tim responds by giving ronald a noogie
joan dean and ronald roam the holidome halls
tim jumps out from behind a corner whips some ice machine ice at dean
dean takes off running after tim
joan and ronald follow
the song fades out as the four of them approach the pool area
the sign on the pool door says hours am pm
this is ridiculous you guys
told you it closed an hour ago
tim tries the door
dean and joan go in
tim and ronald stay in the hall
this isnt you
who is it then
you know what i mean
weve both worked our tails off
why poop it away on
check this out captain nemo
dean has placed the top of a garbage can on his head
it looks like an old time scuba apparatus
dean slides down the kiddie slide into the pool fully clothed
tim busts up
it looks like too much fun
cedar rapids no frickin way
tim goes through the door
ronald shakes his head
tim turns back sees ronald walking away
tim thinks a beat then keeps on
other than deans splashing its quiet and peaceful in the semi darkness
joan sits on a lawn chair
whaddaya say lippe
take a dippy
ich can nicht schwimmen
thats i cant swim
and i cant
sides i didnt bring a bathing suit
so we stay in the shallow end
starts removing clothes and neither did i
now in her bra and thong joan jumps in
dean bobs around with the trash can on his head
tim slowly starts to undress
he carefully places his money belt on a table
he gets down to his t shirt and tightie whities
he eases himself into the shallow end
joan back strokes over to tim
he tries to look elsewhere
joan undoes her bra
cedar rapids she removes the bra revealing her breasts lovely soft bright white orbs surrounded by very tan skin
you have tan
you have a
joan gets close to tim
his arms remain at his side
i have a fian
she kisses him on the mouth moves his hands to her breasts
tim gives in
they make out
in the deep end dean takes the garbage can off his head and watches
joan pulls off tims t shirt flings it aside
theyre really going to town
off screen we hear a sliding door open
high angle specifically four floors up from this pov it looks like tim and joan are having sex
dean meanwhile has moved closer and may or may not be masturbating as he watches them
reveal whose pov this is orin has come out onto his balcony
he looks aghast
what the hecks going on down there
tim looks up makes fleeting eye contact with orin
tim scrambles to get out of the pool
joan is a half step behind him
dean decides that now would be a good time to moon orin
suck my ass helgesson
im calling security
tim grabs his money belt as he and joan run out of the pool area
note tim has a conspicuous erection
cedar rapids joan still topless leads tim by the hand as they sprint toward her room
they run past a security guard along the way
note tim still has a conspicuous erection
they burst into joans room laughing to the point of tears
were so dead
then joan mauls tim
she tackles him to her bed
he rolls on top of her
a primal guttural howl erupts from tim
then i want to make love
dean pounds on the door to the junior suite
come on ronimal
my key got wet
wake up man
ah fuck it
dean lumbers away leaving puddles of water in his wake
tim lies in bed beatific
joan now wearing glasses and conservative pjs comes out of the bathroom
your bodys just so
firm and pretty
making love to you was just super
joan just smiles as she gets into bed
cedar rapids i love to cuddle
youre special joan
joan awkwardly pats tim on the head as he drifts to sleep
joan is talking on the phone with her son
her demeanor is entirely different a tone and physicality weve not seen
no baby you guys are playing at papillion la vista
ralston is next week
calm down tyler
youre not gonna miss it
its not that far
put your dad on
tim wakes up
the morning light hurts his hung over eyes
did you not look at the schedule on the fridge
did we not have this conversation minutes before i left
listens sighs no no no
the playoffs are in ralston
this is the last regular season game
he actually has a chance to play richie
tim staggers out of bed smiles
joan holds up a finger
fine but watch your speed on th by giles road
chris beelers gotten busted twice right there
by that golf course
yeah tara hills
love you too
oh tell ty to kick some butt for me
she hangs up
tim does a theatrical stretch and yawn
cedar rapids crisis on the home front
sorry if i woke you up
tim sees that joans computer is open and his two diamond presentation is up on the screen
were you looking at my two diamond presentation
your cell phone kept ringing in your little fanny pack thing so i shut it off
when i saw the discs i figured id take a look
its a solid presentation
it was roger lemkes
yeah i see that
you know we were together right
you and roger you mean
its so stupid but everyone basically treated us like the brangelina of asmi for a while there
it ended two years ago
he was getting into some pretty weird stuff
as we all know now
tim is livid
he ejects his disc from joans computer
come on lippe
it doesnt matter
you knew didnt you
my foot i knew
no i did not
and yes it most certainly does matter
man this ts me off
cedar rapids tell me youre not jealous
you cant be jealous
the guys dead
every stinkin place i go people remind me youre no roger lemke
youre not as good as roger lemke
here we go again
tim roger was a small minded egotistical jerk
youre an infinitely better man than he was
this stops tim in his tracks
better than roger lemke
why were you with him then
this stops joan in her tracks
her inner pain percolates
i dont know
i dont know
i guess i probably maybe dont like myself very much
i dont know
youre pretty and smart and just super awesome
i like you
she allows a chuckle
tim rubs her shoulders supportive
im so frickin confused
last thing i thought was that id come to cedar rapids and fall in love
joan shakes him off
what are you talking about
what are you talking about
theres no this
theres no us
i have a family
cedar rapids what about
what about it
i told you what i do here
in cedar rapids
it stays here
tim gets up even more pissed off than he was before
where the heck are my clothes
come on tim
were adults here
youre acting like a child
well youre acting like a fricking
he wraps up in a towel grabs his money cummerbund and goes
joan looks at the rumpled bed sheets starts making the bed
as she does she sees the clairol nice n easy hair dye box in the garbage
joan smiles a what has become of my life smile
she sits on the bed and stares out the window
a maid looks up from her cart smiles
tim wearing only the towel mumbles as he walks by
i lost my slacks somewhere
tims clothes remain where he left them the night before
we drift off his clothes to a chubby kid with floaties bobbing in the pool
the kid is staring at something dean is asleep in a chaise lounge chair in his underpants
tim approaches the junior suite just as ronald exits
tim self consciously tightens the towel
cedar rapids im really really sorry ronald
if i said anything or
hey its not ronald wilkess job to judge you tim
end of the day the lords got that covered
but am i disappointed
you bet i am
heck im all for having fun
but i didnt think you were one of these guys who comes down here only to get loaded and act like a derelict
no im not
dean still in his underpants approaches
you should have stuck around last night ronimal
watching timbo and the o fox get it on in the pool shit i was harder than chinese arithmetic
what a couple of class acts
im running late for the prayer breakfast
oh and tim bill krogstads been trying to reach you all morning
ronald walks off
bill krogstad paces in a church talking on his phone
tim bill krogstad again
orin helgesson told me about your little hootenanny in the pool there
clear violation of asmis morals code meaning we lose our asmi certification we lose our two diamond rating we lose our customers and i lose any chance of anyone buying
my goddamn business
cedar rapids i may as well just commit suicide
father of the bride
reveal an obese bride and her greasy mustached groom pose for a photographer
to photographer despondent yah
be there in a
call me when you get this tim
because unless you pull off a miracle were done
youve let me down hard
shaping up to be the worst day of my life
krogstad hangs up
he walks over to his large beaming daughter
he puts on a fake smile as she gives him a hug
you look real beautiful kayla
like a flower
the photographer snaps a photo
krogstad chokes back tears
tim stares at his cell phone
he looks in the mirror
he picks up a hairbrush and tries to break it
but it wont break
that time of the month
off tims look cmon man its gonna be ok
no its not
nothing is ok
my job my fiance
dawns on him god im a philanderer
ive let bill down
ive let everybody down
cedar rapids dean leads tim out of the bathroom
tim sits on a desk chair
dean sits on the edge of the desk
he looks fatherly
my ex patti
well established fact that this broad is a serious fucking cuntstain right
but like i say shes made it pretty much so the kids hate my guts im the bad guy
cept when our year old daughter comes home pregnant oh yeah happy day in the ziegler household lemme tell ya whos the one so depressed that she cant get out
from under the afghan on the goddamn couch
and whos the one planning the baby showers and taking meg to the gyno all that shit
the fucking deanzie
tim stares at dean for an incredulous moment
why is this all of a sudden about you dean
im telling you this buddy because it shows to go ya even if youre a fucking waste of space jerk off like myself theres always opportunities to do the right
if this two diamond bullshit and that matters so much youll find a way to make it right
if not fuck it
lifes way too short to lose sleep over shit that dont matter
tim slowly nods surprised to find himself moved
orin enthusiastically introduces a woman in a smart pantsuit
without any more ado our keynote speaker iowa insurance commissioner mrs
the room goes nuts
as orin leaves the stage he spots tim waiting in the wings
tim gestures for orin to come outside
cedar rapids orin stone faced approaches tim
president helgesson please let me stay in the two diamond contest
this isnt for me its for bill krogstad
i cant let him down
please just let me compete
orin nods almost imperceptibly
tim and orin silently ride the elevator to the fourth floor
orin opens the door to the tiffany suite a slightly larger version of the junior suite
he ushers tim inside
self deprecating but proud tiffany suite
perks of the presidency guess youd say
have a seat on the davenport
orin goes to the mini fridge takes out a sprite
orin opens the sprite drinks
he reaches into a briefcase
he hands tim a document with dozens of signatures on it
this is the petition
tim shakes his head as he reads the names
between you and me this was a ploy by mike pyle
trying to drive down the value of northlands so he could get it on the cheap
cedar rapids just as deanzie predicted
orin snatches back the petition
he rips it in two
i just made that happen
makes rain gesture northlands keeps its three previous two diamond awards
oh my gosh really
orin sits next to tim on the couch closer than he needs to
one thing roger lemke knew tim
he knew that when you get all dolled up go to the prom the big dance that you gotta be prepared to put out
to show a little teat
off tims confused look you ever hear of paypal tim
ive used it to pay for beanie babies on e bay
for my fiance
thing you gotta ask yourself now is this am i ready to dance
am i ready to show a little teat
i dont understand what you mean
calm down orin
please lets talk e commerce for a minute
tim hesitantly follows orin to the desk
a laptop sits open
four years ago the brain trust at asmi national mandated we go on line for everything
billing newsletter the whole shebang
now im almost years old is about as likely to figure this deal out as i was to learn chinese
well as you know roger lemke was a real whiz on the computer
cedar rapids you bet
so rogers up here looking over this new system and he gets one of these lightbulb going off kinda looks the way he did
and he says orin with that newsletter going digital youre saving almost four grand a year in printing costs alone
you see where this is going tim
i cant say that i do
what has asmi ever given orin helgesson
not dime one
sure as shoot not an opportunity to serve on the national board
have i not been a good president
do i not deserve a little something
youre an awesome president
youre goddamn right i am
orin pounds his fist on the desk
tim swallows hard
but i dont know the first blessed thing about this paypal deal
roger had the on line know how not me
im still not reading you here
there arent printing costs anymore see
the asmi teers digital
dont you get it tim
all that money almost hundred dollars a year that goes into a paypal account now
my paypal account
but ive got no idea how to use it
cedar rapids do you literally mean you just need help like getting on line or
your performance in that scavenger hunt was first rate
then i see you in the pool making love to that floozy i realize maybe youve got a bit of lemkes shall we say moral ambiguity
i need that
youre talking about stealing
pontoon boats dont pay for themselves tim
roger lemke came to the prom
he showed me a little teat
i rewarded him with the two diamonds three years running
im prepared to do the same for you
what do you say
you take home those those two diamonds northlands value skyrockets bill krogstad retires to his time share
we push in on tim at the crossroads of all crossroads
outside a clap of thunder booms ominously
id be doing it for northlands to keep it in brown valley and help my co workers
to help bill
tim looks away avoiding eye contact
then what would you need me to do exactly
orin claps once smiles like a proud grandparent
dean has dozens of hello my name is stickers with deanzie for president
written on them
he forces one on a woman
cedar rapids vote for deanzie
vote for change
im good thanks
well fuck you very much carla
the woman shakes her head and walks away
i can count on your vote tomorrow right ronimal
not a snowballs chance in hades
youre all a bunch of dicks
spots tim o
hey there hangover harry
hours and counting
got your guns loaded for the two diamonds partner
tims guilt is apparent in his awkward demeanor
i dont know about that
dont be nervous
youll do fine
theres a prayer circle tonight before the entertainment program might help ease your mind
im sorry about
tim abruptly walks away
dean and ronald look at each other perplexed as tim exits the hotel into the pouring rain
a cold hard rain falls as tim walks from the holidome toward an applebees across the busy street
cedar rapids tim enters and walks to the bar
hes soaking wet and looks despondent
a cheery female bartender kay greets him
a large cream sherry please
as she pours a healthy glass of sherry looks like you could use some cheering up
what do you call it when it rains chickens and ducks
thats pretty hilarious
tim slams the sherry in one gulp to kays dismay
i have to use the little boys room
kay watches as tim heads for the bathroom
he leaves his cell phone on the bar
tim pees at the urinal
he zips up goes to wash his hands
in the mirror hes shocked to see a squinty drugged out man exit the stall followed by
a moment of recognition
off her confused look its tim lippe
from the asmi convention
we met out in front of the holidome across the street
bree coughs a hacking phlegmy cough
shes very out of it
cedar rapids thats what you get from smoking all those whatd you call em heaters
he removes a few hard candies from his pocket
she takes one
small world huh
you wanna party
ooh thats really awesome of you to ask
but i have a super important presentation in the morning unfortunately so
the squinty eyed man gary who has been drinking out of the sink looks up at tim
i gotta work in the morning too
cant be productive or whatever without occasionally taking a little ride on the good times express
its like fuck that shit yo
i hear that
were going to this thing at my uncle kens later after his shifts done
bree examines tim standing stiffly hands in his pockets
you look like youre in serious need of some relaxation dude
bree nonchalantly pinches his nose
tim looks oddly touched
i have had a pretty messed up day actually
might not hurt to forget about it for a little while
cedar rapids mike pyle in a bold chartreuse sweater vest quietly confers with orin outside a conference room
my advice mike
pull the trigger
ive pretty well convinced him that his companys in the crapper
thousand is as low as i could possibly get him
hes said nothing to indicate id have to hang onto his employees or the office up there right
bill was real clear about that
youre buying his clients not his brand
youve done this before mike
the northlands policies will simply roll over into your allstate office in milwaukee
unless you want to keep a satellite branch up there in north palookaville
lets pull the trigger
oh and mike were square on my consultants fee
ten percent as agreed
now just give me a second here
orin enters the conference room alone
he un mutes a speakerphone
the chicken dance polka blares from the other end
were all systems go over here bill
cedar rapids praise christ
this is super orin
i was able to get pyle up to thousand for you bill which is pretty amazing given all the
the tribulations and that
of course that number doesnt include my percent consultants fee
wedding guests do the chicken dance
krogstad strains to be heard over the music
yknow what orin its only a seven hour drive to cedar rapids
if i leave right now i can be there first thing in the a m and we can lock this sonofagun down
i wouldnt want to put you out bill but it would be nice to put pen to paper on a contract sooner than later
its no problem
ill be there in time to see the two diamond presentations not that that matters to me anymore
thanks a million orin
krogstad clicks off his phone pumps his fist overjoyed
he approaches his wife
dione the deals going through
were getting this albatross off our backs after all
im going to cedar rapids
goddamnit dione not now
this is happening
no flex on this one
cedar rapids krogstad hustles out of the reception hall
the fleshy bride and her oily groom watch him go
on stage a jack nicholson impersonator does a lame routine
you cant handle the truth
joan and ronald are in the back of the room
we used to get bands ronald
remember reo let me get on stage and play tambourine
ill go ahead and admit this is an odd choice for an asmi headliner
budget crunch i guess
danny isnt here mrs
dean urgently approaches joan and ronald
are you ready for this
mike pyle of shit just bought northlands
word is the cocksuckers liquidating timbo and the whole brown valley operation
does tim know
dont look at me
i dont think tim likes me very much anymore
cry me a fucking river honey
this isnt about you for once
fuck off dean
come on you guys
cut it out
the crowd guffaws as faux jack does his thing
cedar rapids i said im not gonna hurt ya
im just going to bash your brains in
a pall overtakes the room this used to be fun
now its just kind of sad
you two are a couple of serious fucking downers man
timbo left here in a huff a few hours ago you saw him ronimal
maybe he already knew
shit the kids one of my best friends
you met him two days ago ziegler
know what blow me ronald
its not my fault youre too goddamn afraid to open up and tell another man you love him
do what you want but the deanzies gonna make sure his friend is doing ok
bostons more than a feeling blares on the radio of a pick up truck
tim politely rocks out sandwiched between bree and gary in the front seat
a violent looking wire thin man in an applebees uniform uncle ken drives
after a bit that must be pretty all right ken getting half off at applebees all the time
id only weigh like thousand pounds
pass me that cube skeet
gary opens the glove box passes ken a glass pipe
ken lights up takes a hit passes it to bree
bree follows suit then passes the pipe to tim
tim looks at it pauses
this would be marijuana im guessing
then they all laugh like crazy
so tim laughs too
bree puts the pipe in tims mouth
he looks frightened
cedar rapids suck the glass dick dude
bree lights the pipe
tim inhales and instantly oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck
tims eyes bulge his teeth grind
then he shakes his head like a wet dog and violently coughs
oh jeez oh jeez oh jeez
a butterscotch might help
dean has his phone to his ear
ronald and joan watch
trying to reach tim lippe
who am i talking to
this is kay over at the applebees
your friend left his phone here
is he there now
no hes not
be honest i was kinda worried about the little guy
a series of shots as tim sweaty high and extremely hyper dances with bree to the deafening death metal
the party is a volatile mix of biker types and speed freaks
even though his salmon colored oxford shirt has come untucked from his casual slacks tim still looks a tad out of place
the following conversation is shouted because of the music
cedar rapids not sure he heard right tim pauses
then what the heck
he unzips his money belt
dean ronald and joan look worried as they listen to kay the friendly applebees bartender
like i say he was pretty ripped from all that sherry
he left with ken and them for some party
kens our cook
we all think he deals dope though
i get along good with everyone
hes just real different
dyou know where they were going
you could try kens place
its way out in the boonies
bree snorts a line in a disgusting fetid bathroom
tim sits on the counter
hes jacked up sweaty and very chatty
cedar rapids my mom became real protective of me after my dad passed
she didnt really let me play sports or any of that
fact if i think about it i never really did much of anything
except gardening which i do enjoy
well youre livin now
she offers tim a line
i bought some pills too
thesell make you feel better
she gives him a couple pills
he pops them without thinking
its funny though because my job is all about protecting other peoples dreams
but what about my dreams
it could be like maybe
does another line whoa shits tight
like maybe it has to do with your parents both dying
like maybe by protecting other people its like youre trying to save your parents
like somehow you feel like its your fault
like in your sub conscience
something struck a nerve with tim
he chokes up
and so youre not really like living your own life fully
but dude let me tell you this the only real insurance in this life is love
that did it
now tim is weeping
oh baby cmere
you can fuck my ass if you want
cedar rapids before tim can respond to that the door bursts open
its uncle ken and he is not happy
krogstad chugs coffee as he drives through the night
orin and mike pyle laugh as they raise a glass for a toast
deans minivan pulls into the gravel driveway of the dilapidated isolated farmhouse
we can tell its the party house by the music blasting and the degenerates on the porch
dean and joan climb out of the minivan
the rain is falling harder
ronald slides open the back door and climbs out
he has on a long black rain coat
he nearly slips on some ice
this place is bad news
uncle ken grabs tim and shoves him out into the hall
tim trips over a wasted teen girl and stumbles against the wall
bree looks legitimately worried for tim
dean joan and ronald formulate a plan
ill be standing by case things get squirrelly in there
getaway vehicle type scenario
cedar rapids so youre sending me into that shithole
how chivalrous dean
you and me can go in joan
itll be fine im sure
uncle ken drags tim into a kitchen full of partygoers gathered around a keg of natural ice
he shoves tim face first against the wall
tim takes this opportunity to notice the peeling wallpaper which surprisingly has the same floral pattern as his own kitchen wallpaper
ronald and joan approach the front door
judging from the looks on the faces of the dudes on the porch black folks are not a common sight at this residence
gary the squinty eyed guy tim met in the bathroom with bree ogles joan
not missing a beat thanks
we dont want any trouble guys
were just looking for our friend
the dudes let joan and ronald pass into the house
dean sits silently in the drivers seat
the quiet gets to him
he starts humming then mumble sings to himself and drums the steering wheel
mm mow mow
two tickets to paradise
hmm hmm pack your bags well leave tonight
cedar rapids joan and ronald make their way through the house clocking the aggressively angry looks as they go
joan sees something oh shit
in the kitchen uncle ken is choking tim
the partygoers cheer
uncle ken punches tim in the stomach
tim falls to the filthy linoleum
but he paid for it uncle ken
you cant let some dude pay for crystal meth and an ass fuck with a travelers check bree
that shit can be traced
its fully insured
and we didnt make love
shut the fuck up
he kicks tim hard
its looking bad when all of a sudden hey
they all turn to see ronald
in the black trench coat he actually looks bad ass
he has one hand in the coat pocket
hard core gangsta speak i may look like some suit wearin businessman to yall
truth is im straight up gangsta
and i always keeps one in the chamber
indicates the bulge in his pocket in case you ponderin
so i suggest for the time being that you let my nigga be
uncle ken blinks a few times
then he lets tim get up
cedar rapids ronald takes tims arm
joan joins them
the three of them walk backwards toward the door
dean is outside the minivan taking a leak on a tree
he looks toward the house
ronald tim and joan exit the house
they run for deans minivan
tim slips sliding across the snow and mud
ronald drags him halfway across the lawn before tim finally gets to his feet
dean meanwhile tries to finish peeing as he makes his way back to the van doing a sort of crab walk to avoid pissing on himself
tim ronald and joan dive into the minivan
dean climbs back into the drivers seat
bree and gang exit the house and watch as dean peels out tossing up bits of gravel as he speeds away
dean looks nervously in the rearview mirror all clear
ronald tries to calm tim down in the backseat
what the fuck happened
oh my god tim
are you ok
i dont know
i dont know
all i know is i was getting kicked and then ronald was there talking like a ghetto person
dean looks at joan and ronald what
cedar rapids in order to extricate tim from what was clearly a volatile situation i did in fact rely on my community theater training
i dont like to brag but i do a pretty convincing omar from the hbo program the wire
beat as a gangsta least them crackers back yonder seemed to buy it
the minivan speeds through the dark rainy night
tim sits on the couch bouncing his legs still messed up
joan sits with him
dean and ronald watch worried
i cant believe bill would do this to me
he was like a father
wasnt just krogstad timbo
orins the real devil in this deal
joan shoots dean a look shut the fuck up
youll find another job lippe
maybe even move to a new town
shoot you could come work for me if you wanted
for some reason tim finds this funny
he laughs hysterically
i love you joan
to dean ronald get some sleep you guys
ill stay up with him make sure he doesnt chew his arm off
ronald sighs nods
dean kisses tims sweaty forehead
cedar rapids sleep good little friend
dean and ronald head for the bedroom
tim looks at joan
i didnt make love to bree joan
it doesnt matter
here lie down lippe
tim rests his head on joans lap
his eyes are still on fire
oh dear what can the matter be johnnys so long at the fair
he promised to bring me a pocket of posies
tim shuts his eyes
joan must be a good mom
a knocking sound fades in providing a orin stirs in his king size bed
the knocking is at his door
he gets out of bed puts on a robe and goes to the door
he peeks through the eyehole
just a sec
orin glances in the mirror smooths his hair
he undoes the chain and opens the door
tim bursts in and attacks
orin being relatively frail immediately tumbles to the carpet
this cant be good
krogstad yawns but drives with determination as his car passes a sign that reads cedar rapids miles
cedar rapids dean and ronald sleep soundly in their beds
we drift off of them to the couch where joan has fallen asleep
she wakes realizes that tim is no longer there
the first hints of daylight illuminate the eastern sky
kenny loggins whenever i call you friend plays on the radio
tim still hopped up drives
he enthusiastically sings along
sweet love showin us a heavenly light
i never seen such a beautiful sight
see love glowin on us every night i know forever well be doin it right
tim drives past a farm and sees dozens of hogs foraging around in a sloppy pen
he stomps the brakes sliding dangerously onto the muddy shoulder
tim gets out of the car
the peppy song is still playing
tim sings along as he dances to the back of the car
i always wanna call you friend
sweet love showin us a heavenly
tim opens up the trunk
thats when we see inside the trunk orin in his pajamas bound and gagged by holiday inn bedsheets
his shouts are muffled by the gag
tim pulls orin from the trunk
orins feet are tied together so he has to hop as tim leads him toward the hog farm
its super slippery
orin falls face first into the muddy ditch
cedar rapids tim helps orin to his feet
several enormous hogs rush toward them on the other side of a barbed wire fence
terrified through gag nmmmmmmmmm
i did a ton of research on hog farm risk mitigation
dont worry they might bite you a little if they think youre a food source
but theres never been a recorded hog bite death
with great difficulty tim picks up orin
then he awkwardly hurls him over the barbed wire fence
orin lands on his back in a deep pile of mud and hog shit
the hogs descend
the two diamonds may be meaningless to you and bill
but there are people who care about this stuff
honest good people
ill come back for you after the two diamonds have been handed out to a legitimate winner
im really sorry about this orin but the insurance industry deserves better than you
tim goes to his car leaving orin wriggling with the hogs
a husband and wife sleep
their phone rings
the clock says am
the woman rolls over
who the hecks calling at this hour on a sunday morning
the man answers the phone
note we should now recognize the couple as the clients tim dealt with in the northlands conference room
kurt gambsky tim lippe your insurance agent
hows pam and the girls
cedar rapids whispers to wife tim lippe
um fine tim
everything ok by you
tim talks on his cell as he drives
well i think everythings ok
hope it is anyway
listen kurt heres why im calling
an eagle soars on a large video screen
a patriotic anthem plays
we boom down from the screen to find ronald
hes on stage finishing up his two diamond presentation
people sometimes say that promises are cheap
you know what ronald wilkes says to that
n s f
not so fast
at the end of the day a mans word is a sacred creed
and the word i give you at ronald wilkes insurance is i will work for you
the words ronald wilkes insurance working for you appear on screen
ronalds face dissolves over the eagle
the crowd goes nuts applauding wildly
dean and joan start a standing ovation
ronald though exhausted beams on stage
tim is nowhere to be found
an executive council member addresses the crowd
once again folks president helgesson left a note under my door this morning saying he had to leave asmi early due to a family emergency
i havent been able to reach him on his mobile but obviously our thoughts and prayers go out to orin and his family
cedar rapids a moment of silence now
were set to hear our final two diamond presenter
tim lip from northlands insurance
joan dean and ronald exchange worried looks
hey travis i dont think tim
just then tim appears
he is filthy covered in mud sweat hog shit and tears
he futilely smooths his hair and tries to tuck in his shirt as he takes the stage to sparse applause
tim goes to the computer set up on stage for power point
he puts in his disc
his presentation appears on the screen
im tim lippe
hog farm risk mitigation
tim knocks a folder off the podium
papers fly everywhere
smooth move ex lax
a few chuckles so hog
this girl i met sorry woman i guess
she takes drugs and i think might be some kind of prostitute
a collective gasp but shes super insightful
yknow what she said to me last night
said the only real insurance is love
thats fricking intense isnt it
at this moment a very pleased bill krogstad walks in with mike pyle
krogstad tenses however when he sees tims state
our only true safety net
i believe in insurance
i believe in love
he looks up and sees bill
my former boss everybody
cedar rapids whatre you doing lippe
whyd you do this bill
i dont understand
krogstad chuckles preferring to avoid any public drama
whyd you do it bill
whyd you do it
whyd you lie bill
to the audience sorry folks
guess its against the law now for a business owner to sell his own business
mustve missed that constitutional amendment
this draws chuckles from the crowd
insurance isnt just a business bill
insurance is personal
ive got some savings
i couldve gotten a loan
we couldve worked something out
still playing to the crowd yeah theres a guy you want running an agency isnt it
come on tim youre tired
youre looking foolish here
you couldnt run an agency if your life depended on it
tims lip starts to quiver and with great effort screw you bill
thats a bunch of dog crap
you and lemke that
you stole my ideas and called them your own for years
and i didnt say squat because i figured we were like a family
i may not have quite as many clients as roger had
but my people are loyal bill
cedar rapids i care about them
and guess what they care about me
fact ive called more than half of them already this morning

and before the day is out ill have called all my clients
all of them
to mike pyle so hey congratulations pyle of shit you just bought a company thats losing half its business
fuck yeah timbo
mike pyle blinks several times
before tim can fully bask in the glow of his triumph right there officer
orin still in his pajamas and caked in hog shit points two cedar rapids cops in tims direction
tactful pandemonium ensues
dean ronald and joan rush to tims side
jesus lippe what did you do
this is no good
whats the fucking charge
before the cops get to him tim hands dean a crumpled piece of paper
cedar rapids whats this
youll figure it out
a cop cuffs tim and leads him out of the ballroom
tim sits on a metal bench in a dank holding cell
i know what youre thinking thinking this wiseacres full of baloney
am i right
reveal hes chatting with a massive black man reginald
but im telling you reginald youre actually a perfect candidate for term life
a guard opens the cell door
he pronounce it like lippy
well youre outta here lippe
tim hands reginald a business card
call any time on the mobile or home phone though
the office numbers no good anymore
reginald gives tim a warm hug
youre all right
cedar rapids tim walks out of the jail into the bright sunlight
dean is there waiting for him
they walk toward deans minivan
dont even say it deanzie no one butt rammed me or whatever in there
i love it
dean gives tim a hug
he then pulls a crumpled piece of paper from his pocket its the sheet tim gave him earlier

when i saw it at first i was like shit am i supposed to take money out of the account or what
nah it was more fun watching the smug fuck sweat
i told him id rat his pathetic ass out if he didnt drop the charges against you
a genuine smile sweet
dean tosses the paper into the trash
we now see what it says
on holiday inn stationary in tims scrawl www
ronald rides shotgun
tim and joan are in back
the minivan cruises past downtown cedar rapids
tim looks up at the buildings
ronald considers his two diamond plaque
cedar rapids its not as cool as i thought itd be
i dont think this is even real wood
lacking his usual energy ill show you some real wood
ronald starts giggling
it turns into a laugh
the laugh becomes infectious
before long tim joan ronald and dean are all laughing their asses off
dean ronald and joan accompany tim now cleaned up to the airport
tim sets down his old american tourister
punches his arm i told you you were a hero lippe
insurance man saves the day

ronald gives tim a more subdued hug

mutual of omahas wild kingdom

he puts out his hand
she laughs and hugs him instead
tim closes his eyes
she feels so good
smells so good
joans eyes are wide open
she swallows hard
she will not cry
keep telling yourself everything will be ok
cedar rapids tim looks out the window watching the city lights of cedar rapids fade away
he catches his reflection in the window
he smiles a little
tim relaxes in his seat
he looks at his seat mate a pleasant looking woman in her mid s
so did you do anything fun in cedar rapids
superscript one day later tim loads a plate with macaroni meatloaf peas and mashed potatoes
millie selects fish potatoes rice and corn
they wordlessly walk from the buffet to a booth
they sit and start eating in silence
after a bit hows the walleye
meatloafs on the dry side
tim tries to smile at millie
he is surprised to see that her eyes are filling with tears
without saying a word millie struggles to pry the small diamond engagement ring from her sausage like finger
finally she gets it off and hands it to tim
he thinks of protesting
instead he takes the ring and puts it in his pocket
millie sniffles a bit composes herself
tim opens his mouth to say something
before he can think of anything to say
cedar rapids wade sits down with a ridiculously full plate of food
shit where were they hidin the meatloaf
tim dumps birdseed in the feeder
sunlight filters through the tree branches
the snow is starting to melt
youre just gonna attract red squirrels with that junk tim
tim smiles at his old gnarled neighbor leslie
how ya doin there leslie
ach im too old to give a shit
they take off their gloves to shake hands
leslie wont let go of tims hand the way old men sometimes do
bill krogstad told me hes switching our policy to some fella down in milwaukee
says i wont notice a bit of difference in coverage or nothin
no you probably wont
anyhow i told the cocksucker to go fuck himself
says im going with tim lippe
a man i can trust
its a good thing youre doin keepin work in brown valley
leslie pats tim on the shoulder
as he heads back inside
cedar rapids let me know when them red squirrels show up at your feeder
ill borrow you my
he goes back to his yard
at his feeder a robin
a sure sign of spring
an uplifting song fades in along with the chances we take in life are called risks
on a lake tim is pulled behind a boat on waterskis
he falls face first skipping across the lake
we pay insurance companies premiums as a way of hedging our bets in case those risks we take cause us or our property harm
at a ball diamond tim playing in a summer softball league slides headfirst into third base
thats the point of insurance so we can live and love life to the fullest
at a strip mall a couple walks past a discount shoe store and into tim lippe insurance
the camera follows them into the cramped decidedly unimpressive office
tim seated at a desk looks directly at the camera and stiffly addresses it
at tim lippe insurance we cant guarantee that youll live your life without devastating losses
but we can give you peace of mind knowing that if something awful or unfortunate does happen well have you covered
tim lippe insurance
insuring your home and your hopes
cedar rapids a fanciful unicorn prances across the screen and we reveal tim dean and ronald have been watching tims ad on a tv at a lakeside cabin
tim looks proudly at his friends
can i be honest here tim
what was with the fuckin unicorn
it represented hope
alls im saying is you mightve wanted to hire an actor with some professional training
jesus a retarded kid just sitting there yelling wouldve been better than you
aw youre both a couple of a holes
tim whips an empty beer can at dean
the three friends laugh living life in the moment
as it should be
