b if window
href b b little nicky by tim herlihy adam sandler steven brill a beautiful late summer night
crickets chirping sprinklers sprinkling
we pan across one particular lawn up one particular tree where we see the peeper jon lovitz sitting on a limb
he has a bottle of wine some sandwiches a walkman
suddenly the lights turn on
we see a young mother walk into the room outside the peepers window
she is wearing business attire
rough day at the office mrs
takes bite of sandwich well youll feel better once you slip off those work clothes and get into some sweats
the mother sits on the bed and pulls off her shoes rubbing her feet
oh my g d yes
i wish you would let me rub those feet
of course i wouldnt use my hands
heh heh heh heh
he sips some wine
the mother starts to unbutton her blouse
she takes it off revealing a nice bra
looks like victoria just told me her secret
the peeper frantically writes in a dirty notebook
mouthing the words as he goes
thursday the ninth eight thirty p
first brassiere sighting
stops writing i will pleasure myself to this image for months
months i tell you
the mother starts to unbutton her pants
her young son walks in wearing a scouts uniform
young scottie dunleavy
what unfortunate timing
you mother was just getting comfy
the son talks to his mother excitedly
yes yes im sure you tied many great knots today or whatever
now get out
the son not going anywhere sits in a chair
this simply wont do
the peeper takes out a cell phone and dials
the son answers
why dont you go downstairs like a good boy and let your mother freshen up
who is this
just a little birdie
a birdie who wants to see if your mothers panties match her bra
oh my g d scottie
is there a man up our tree
the peeper gets nervous
tell her no
tell her its just a big bird
the peeper starts flapping his arms and making bird noises
we see scottie with his sling shot
the mother nods yes
he shoots it
it hits the peeper square in the head
he falls to the ground with a thud
dunleavy please come help me
and wear your bikini
the peeper looks up
he sees scottie pushing a television out the window
it lands on top of the peeper
the peeper is zooming down a hole walls of dirt racing by on all sides
the peeper is falling down down down
the whole way screaming like a five year old girl
we see the tunnel turn into more of a slide now and the peeper races towards the opening which is lit by fire
he we see the gate wall of flames
we hear screaming
we see the peeper come flying through the flames and land in a heap in a shallow pit of coals
dazed he stands and we see other people shooting through the fire wall at different levels
note all the arrivals clothes are now burned shredded
the peeper looks left to see the gatekeeper standing at his station greeting the new souls with mock cheer
am i in hell
what do you think
a giant bird appears and bites the peepers crotch area
we leave the peeper in the pit and tilt up to
the vast and insane kingdom of hell
a road leads toward it like the yellow brick road only with fire and coals
we see the black castle in the distance
the camera zooms into the castle to one particular window
looks like an american teenagers room models a dresser heavy metal posters tons of ozzy stuff everywhere but no bed devils dont sleep
nicky is air guitaring to the song
over at the stereo we see the cassette playing titled the head demon jimmy the demon opens the door scaring nicky who falls backward into the table breaking it
your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room
okay but jimmy when the house is rockin dont forget the knockin
adrian and cassius are playing darts
theyre aiming for peoples faces that are coming through the wall
i knew it
hes finally retiring
ive been waiting on this day for ten thousand years
he throws a dart that hits one of the heads in the forehead
if the old man picks me to take over hell ill keep the torture going twenty four seven
well dad says its the breaks that make the torture
you have to let people feel a sense of relief
cassius whips a dart which hits one of the human dartboards in the eye
then again the beauty of dad retiring is what he says doesnt matter anymore
cassius pulls out the dart
the eye comes with it
ill take that
cassius throws the eye on the ground and stomps it
it splatters like a grape
was that really necessary
nicky enters sheepishly
hey hows daddys little girl doing today
cassius snaps his fingers in nickys face
wanna mind wrestle
cassius eyes start glowing red
actually ill take a rain check on nicky is slammed into a nearby desk as if by an invisible force
picking up his head yes you got me
nickys head slams back down again
got ya again
picking head up got me for sure yes
he grabs a lamp off the desk and cracks himself over the head
now heres the big finish
nicky frowns as he finds his own right hand heading for his own crotch
nickys hand is being possessed
it gets closer and closer until it latches on to nickys crotch
cassius concentrates even harder making nicky twist his own hand
nicky screams even louder
they dont notice that dad wearing a sweatsuit and with very small devil horns enters behind them
what are you boys doing
cassius releases nickys hand
just re arranging the furniture
cassius didnt i tell you to stay out of your brothers mind
maybe this will help you remember
dads eyes flash red and cassius punches himself hard in the nose sending him back against the wall and down to the floor
dad gives nicky a wink
dad has an air of confidence and power
now everybody sit down
hey dad im almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape
i really think its a masterpiece
okay kid well listen to it later
he leads the boys to the throne area
we see outside the window the peeper staring in sexily
dad looks shakes his head
just then the bird appears and attacks him
dad closes the curtains
nicky adrian and cassius sit on little stools at the foot of his throne
dad lights a cigarette with his finger the tip of which glows red like a cigarette lighter and looks down at his three sons
my dad your granddad lucifer was thrown out of heaven by g d and rules here in hell for ten thousand years
and after this ten thousand years had passed he decided to abdicate his throne
confused nicky sheepishly raises his hand
to step aside
nicky lowers his hand and let me become the ruler of hell
this as some of you might know is my ten thousandth year as prince of darkness
so i think the time has come to discuss who will succeed me
jimmy the demon walks in
he whispers in dads ear
no no thats not what i said
he can keep his thumbs but the fingers gotta go
turning to leave oh and dont forget youre shoving a pineapple up hitlers ass at four oclock
dad nods and jimmy shuffles out
dad turns his attention back to his sons
this was a very difficult decision because i have three wonderful sons
i mean adrian so smart so ruthless
and cassius so strong so tough
and nicky so
dont worry about coming up with anything
such a sweet boy
but after much thought and careful consideration ive decided that the ruler for the next ten thousand years is going to have to be
they all look at nicky
the important thing for the stability of our rule is to maintain the balance between good and evil
and i dont think any of you are ready for that responsibility yet
you need the wisdom that comes only with the passage of time
this is hoyashit
cassius goes flying back
one of the human dartboards laughs
cassius whips a dart and hits him in the tongue
jimmy enters and points at his watch
send him in
to the boys im sorry boys
ive got to get back to work
nicky cassius and adrian start filing out
you sure about this decision dad
im telling you pal its the right thing to do
hitler in a french maids outfit is being brought in by jimmy
they head towards the closet
inside the closet is a crate of pineapples
hitler picks out a relatively small one
dad shakes his head no
dad walks over to the closet
hitler picks out a really big pineapple
dad nods yes
hitler sadly hands it to dad
jimmy bends hitler over and as dad raises the fruit
as the pineapples jammed up his ass
cassius and adrian are standing by the road still flowing with souls
both are pissed
theres a big ugly bigfoot looking monster hanging out with them kind of nodding along
you work your ass off for ten thousand years hurting people helping others hurt people then you get a decision like that
and hes dead serious
its just such a slap in the face
adrian turns to the monster
um excuse me were having a private conversation here
yeah get out of here
cassius insanely snaps his fingers in the monsters face
the monster shrugs and walks off
twenty thousand years ago grandpa lucifer said it is better to rule in hell than serve in heaven
well im getting tired of serving in hell
we need a place where we can rule
cassius throws a rock at the monster
he yelps then turns around motioning like hes thinking about coming back
cassius sees this and gets enraged
oh you wanna be a big man
bring it on
lets see what you got
the monster upon further reflection throws his hands up in an aw phooey gesture and continues walking away
thats what i thought
to cassius could you concentrate for five seconds
i am concentrating
where can we rule
what do you think about
cassius seems to think this isnt a bad idea
we could create our own hell there
you saying we go up there and kill everyone
but first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them
their damned souls will be ours
its our time brother
the two look at each other
they start running toward the fire wall
knocking souls out of their way
hey what are you doing
they get closer to the fire
you cant go through there
the fire flows in not out
they dive through the fire wall
you know something
you guys suck
you really suck
sirens go off
dogs start barking
and we hear the sound of damned souls hitting the back of the firewall hard
dad and nicky are listening to one of nickys metal mix tapes
we hear the end of pink floyds comfortably numb
now that was an experience
you are only coming through in waves
that line blows my mind every time
i dont care what kind of mood youre in at the start of that song
when its over that mood has been altered
well i thought that after messing with your head id give you a little kick in the keester
hits the tape player
enter sandman blasts
who is this metal lick a
i was just playing with you
dad and nicky dance to the song
after careful consideration i regretfully have to decline
cmon man im just asking for one superbowl ring
in exchange for eternal damnation of your soul
youre too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you mr
you did it for namath
yeah but joe was coming here anyways
just go back to earth and enjoy your records and the hall of fame and the beautiful family and all that
this is bullshit man
gets up to leave im gonna win the superbowl this year with or without you
now youre talking
youre a good devil dad
and i also happen to be a jets fan
nicky and dad share a laugh which is interrupted by faint sirens
the gatekeeper enters in a hurry and falls to his knees
your highness cassius and adrian have escaped from hell
they went through the fire and they broke it
i think they took the new york tunnel
i tried to stop them but they overpowered me sir
get off your knees
the gatekeeper stands up
thanks for being so understanding your worship
youre the man
youve always been the man
dads eyes glow red as the gatekeeper stands up
two huge boobs grow out of either side of the gatekeepers head
we only see them from the front for a second
from behind the gatekeeper we see the boobs but not the nipples as he talks to nicky
to nicky im lucky to get away with just the head boobs right
coulda been much worse
thats what im thinkin
dad is staring off
he looks shaken
this is bad nicky
im gonna die nicky
if the gates are broken no new souls can get in which means ill start to deteriorate into nothing
grandpa lucifer enters
whats with all the whoo whoo noises
everythings fine pop
last time you said that the renaissance happened
please pop just go back to your room
regarding gateskeeper can i take him with me and have sex with his head
whatever you want
the gatekeeper walks towards lucifer
oh this is gonna be a whole new lifestyle for me isnt it
we see the coals are cooling down on the road and the damned souls in hell are sneaking off
the demons are baffled and dont quite know what to do
dad jimmy and nicky walk to the frozen fire
whats going on
where are we
we keep hearing people hit behind the frozen fire with loud thuds
nothings getting through that
the fire is solid as a rock
we gotta get this bad boy burning again
to do that cassius and adrian have to come back through the other way
so go get em dad
im too weak
the process has already begun
dad holds up his hand
his pink is hanging by a thread
we see the bigfoot monster grunt disgusted by the sight
so go get em jimmy
im just a demon nicky
i dont got devil blood in me
id last two minutes up there with your brothers
youre not saying its up to me
the monster puts his hands over his eyes shaking his head as if to say oh no
ive never been to earth
ive never even slept over at some other dudes house
youre the spawn of satan
you got it in you
nicky the worst thing that could happen on earth is you get killed in which case boom you end up back here
are you telling me i have to go to earth and kill my brothers
they left together at the exact same time
they gotta come back together at the exact same time
dad takes an ornate flask from his robe
get them drunk from this
one sip and theyll be trapped inside
once youve got both of them you bring the flask back through the gate
dads pinky is hanging
jimmy pulls it off and examines it
the monster gags
your ol mans got less than a week
nicky looks petrified
this cant be happening
son just do your best
nicky looks teary eyed
the moment is broken by the monster who runs in and pushes nicky through the fire
nicky goes through the solid fire wall
the monster taps his own wrist and looks at dad as if to say gotta get a move on
pan down to the darkened bowels of the old station between two tracks to a putrid puddle
nicky breaks through the surface sputtering
we hear a rumbling in the near distance
the blue marble
this doesnt look too bad
nicky sees a fast approaching light furrows his brow and nicky comes shooting through the solid fire wall and lands in the coal pit
his dad limps back to him
you were gone ten seconds
i got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal
thats a train son
dont stand in front of them
well i guess im going to have to take a mulligan on this one
please nicky get back up there
his ear falls off try to hurry
nicky climbs up and heads back toward the fire wall
nicky makes it back through the hole
looks both ways and hops out of the hole
he carefully crosses the tracks and is stopped by the sight of a bulldog beefy on the other side
in his mouth is one of those signs car service drivers use to identify their passengers at the airport
on the sign is scrawled nicky
nicky and beefy stare at each other a beat
beefy drops the sign from his mouth
voice of sandy wernick hey terrific
now get off the track and come with me shitstains
the throng of commuters making their way through the terminal are giving a wide berth to the filthy man whos looking around suspiciously talking to the dog
my names beefy
im an old friend of your fathers
hes asked me to help you out
i just need to find my brothers and be on my way beefy
its not gonna be easy
your brothers can possess people
so they probably wont look like themselves
you have to be suspicious of everyone
nicky looks at beefy warily for a beat
okay bro this jig is up
pulling out the flask just get in the bottle
just slide right on in there
its not me moron
a blind preacher rants outside the entrance
people put money in his pot
oh how the lord loves you
all his children
passerby puts in money he thanks you for your kindness
another woman puts in money god bless maam
the lord loves you
the lord loves you
we see nicky and beefy walk up from behind
the preacher sniffs
the lord does not love you
thrusts his cross in nickys face you make the lord very nervous
feeling hot im burning
running away the devil walks among us
he runs off screaming wildly bumping into people
oh lord save us from hells beast
he gets off course and runs right into a subway entrance
beefy turns to nicky
makin friends already
shivering a little its freezing up here beefy
youre on earth now kid
gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has
well stop by k mart
get you some warm clothes
i also have this odd pain in my mid section
kind of a hollow feeling
that pain is hunger
k mart bag is next to a bench
pan up to see nicky wearing an extra warm ski outfit
sitting next to him on the bench is beefy
between them is a big bucket of popeyes fried chicken
nicky takes out a drumstick
so far so good
put it in your mouth
nicky puts it in his mouth
holds it there
move your teeth up and down
he chews for a long time
now you gotta swallow it
tilt your head back and let the meat slide down your throat hole
he gets a looks of complete joy on his face
popeyes chicken is ass kickin
it sure is
now eat it up
youre gonna need your energy
i got energy up the ying ying
lets get cracking
nicky stands with a drumstick and jogs off the curb right into the path of a moving bus
the monster is rubbing the gatekeepers boobs
the gatekeeper is wearing a modified bra
he seems to be enjoying it
we hear a thud
they look down to see nicky on the ground
we didnt see him flying through this time
the monster and gatekeeper immediately stop
kind of embarrassed
thats a pretty brassiere
could you maybe not tell anyone about this
you got it
could you maybe not tell anyone about this
you got it
nicky turns and walks toward the firewall
as soon as his back is turned the monster pantomimes to the gatekeeper i love your boobs
the gatekeeper gives a flirtatious laugh we dont see him morph back through the wall here
beefy is walking with him down the street
nicky is crazy cautious
from now on
im just going to avoid all moving metal objects
now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the upper east side
but i misplaced it
beefy is sitting on a bench booth at a strip club
champagne is on the table
bills in his mouth
we see three dancers dancing for him
nicky and beefy
so i found this other joint for you
but youre gonna have a roommate
a scruffy thirtyish buy todd allen covert is on the phone in his small bohemian apartment in the village
on phone i know exactly how you feel
the night reagan was elected i said to my mother is this man going to blow up the world mommy
then we both cried for like an hour
knock at the door somebodys here
call you later
todd gets up and opens the door
its nicky with beefy by his side
nicky is nervous and his speech sounds practiced
hello friend my name is nicky
i understand youre seeking a roommate as per your advertisement in the village voice
would it be possible for me to fill the slot
uh dont you want to know what the rent is
nicky looks down at beefy
beefy looks up at nicky
both nod imperceptibly
what is rent
eight hundred split down the middle
tuesdays and thursdays i rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits
and as far as household items we can share the soap but well split the cost
cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldnt have to pay as much as the other guy
looks at nicky arent you boiling in that outfit
its like eighty degrees in this hallway
you from the south
the deep south
nicky laughs a little too hard
why is that funny
i dont know
and sorry man but no dogs allowed
todd turns and goes into the apartment
youll be alright
big day tomorrow
dont forget to do that sleep thing i told you about
to todd is it okay if i do the sleep thing
yeah your bedroom is right over there
the door closes
beefy looks down at the welcome mat
it reads i heart method acting
beefy raises his leg over it
nicky is sleeping on top of the hissing radiator fully clothed
when he inhales through his nose we hear that familiar snoring snorting sound
but when he exhales we hear disturbing speaking in tongues exorcist style voices
slow pan across the room to the doorway where todd stands looking concerned
we hear the bells toll
we see the beautiful exterior of a large church
close on an elderly kind looking cardinal
he ascends the steps to the pulpit and looks out on his large congregation
we see that tv cameras are covering the sunday service
he gins his homily
in todays gospel the lord tells us who we are to live if we wish to attain the splendor of heaven
or something like that
jesus sure says a lot of stuff in the bible
abraham hit me with a whiffle ball bat
the crowd stares dumbfounded
we see that the cardinal is standing on a steaming hot pizza which is still in the box with the top open
yep the lord sure did say a bunch of hibbity jibbity
but has he ever really done anything for us
has he ever put a jaguar xjr in my driveway
has he ever given any of my enemies the herpes
he hasnt done a damn thing for any of us
a middle aged woman stands up
the lord gave my son the strength to get off drugs
maam i know your son and believe me he was better off on drugs
hes a bore
at least when he was smoking hashish he made me laugh occasionally
a young man and his pregnant wife stand up
after we tried for many years the lord finally helped my wife conceive a baby
no your best friend fitzie helped your wife conceive a baby
he helped her conceive it all night long
fitzie whos sitting on the other side of the wife starts to raise the roof
then thinks better of it
the cardinal points to a well dressed man in the front pew
how about you mr
the lord ever do anything for you
the mayor has tinfoil on his feet
standing well i wish i could think of something cardinal but to be honest with you i cant
kind of makes you wonder if there even is a lord
if there is any ultimate punishment for our so called sins
maybe we should all just have fun and do whatever the hell we want
a hubbub is raised by the crowd
fitzie raises the roof again this time energetically
amen to that
let the sin begin
the hubbub grows to a roar
several people start fighting over the money in the collection plate
the cardinal smiles knowingly at the mayor
we hear the cardinals thoughts in adrians voice
oh this is delicious
we hear his telepathic response
laughing let the sin begins that was a good one
well we must get people sinning if we want to fill up our new hell
how are things going down at city hall
i lowered the drinking age to ten
this is so much fun
i never want it to end
why should it end
whos gonna stop us
the mayor cassius laughs
as he does his eyes slowly cross
beefy is taking a dump on the sidewalk
pan over to nicky his pants around his ankles
hes trying to do the same
this is intense
and it happens every day
i gotta tip my hat to you people
look its okay for me to shit the street
but you gotta use a toilet
pulling up pants okay just point me in the right direction next time
come on theres like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking
well lets rock and roll
nicky looks at the next person walking by
its a chinese delivery guy on a bicycle
nicky clotheslines him taking him off the bike in a sleeperhold headlock
get in the bottle
dads falling apart
you froze the gate and youre killing him
nicky puts the flask to the chinese guys lips
im not thirsty
im not thirsty
just get in the flask
the chinese guy breaks loose gives nicky a roundhouse kick to the head and runs away
nicky gets up
adrian and cassius
you think a kick to the head is gonna make me throw in the towel
well in the immortal words of judas priest you got another thing comin
beefy shakes his dog head and sighs as we see nicky hold the bottle up to a few more pedestrians
nicky approaches various people as they pass
to be shot long lense real people real reactions
nicky gets to the front of the line and tries to get the cashier to drink
the cashier yanks his head away and gives nicky a dirty look
nicky shrugs and points to the menu ordering some chicken
nicky walks up to a homeless man
he thrusts the bottle in his face
to nickys surprise the homeless man gladly takes it and drinks
nicky is baffled
he tries to take the flask back but the man wont let go
finally he grabs it away from him
the man starts throwing garbage at nicky as he walks away
beefy is looking around for nicky
he spots him inside the polar bear cage
nicky approaches the bear holding the flask
nicky shoots through the firewall having been killed again
the gatekeeper is wearing tassels on his boobs
the monster laughs
to monster you like that
you think thats funny
the gatekeeper swirls his tassels
how about that
you like that
the monster howls with delight
nicky sits on the rocks beaten and exhausted eating a popeyes drumstick
all that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early
i think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects
now im going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown
beefy hears nickys strange terrible snores
kids got a lot of evil in him just begging to come out
beefy walks away
masses of birds fly out of the trees
squirrels run out of trees
staring at nicky who continues to snore
two heavy metal guys john and peter are listening to danzig and doing a goofy dance
they hear something and turn the music down its the distant sound of nickys snore
sounds like our devil dance actually worked this time
it sounds like i will eat your hearts
the worried people run away
children on the carousel going real fast upset
peter and john walk over to a position near nickys bench
theres our man
sleepyhead must have some major ties to the dark side
a sleazy street vendor shuffles over towards nicky
he eyes the flask which is half hanging out of nickys pocket
whats with that guy
gotta be one of his disciples or something
suddenly the vendor grabs the flask and nickys half eaten drumstick and runs off
yo man i think that devil guy just got ripped off
should we wake him up
you do it
peter gets up and shakes nicky who comes to with a loud rise and shine devil guy
some dude just stole your shit
nicky feels for the flask
fire shoots out of nickys mouth
which way did he go
nicky is about to run off
looks at johns shirt
iron maiden live double disc is simply phenomenal
he runs off
did you check out the dragon mouth
the dark prince is here
nicky is searching the street for his flask
he walks past several street vendors who have set up their wares on the sidewalk
nicky comes walking back into frame as he sees his flask and half eaten drumstick laying on the blanket of the vendor
see something you like my man
i would like my flask back
the street vendor stands very angry
you callin me a thief my man
no im just calling you
a guy who has my flask
and if that is your so called flask how would i have it unless i was in fact a thief
not sure what the answer is i dont know
a yuppie jogger is checking out the flask
yeah how much for the silver flask there
well thats a very special item
the cap itself is one hundred percent plappium
its a value is over three thousand dollars
wheres it from
it was handcrafted in hell by satan himself and is only to be used for the capture and containment of my blood brothers so that the firefall of hades will
burn brightly once again
i think well let you keep it then
he walks away
okay now you gone and done it
you done messed with my business bitch
sir i would prefer if you didnt raise your voice
its making my muscles tighten
we see that nickys eyes are starting to glow red
oh you gonna go all crazy eyes on me
ill show you some crazy eyes
lets get busy
the vendor makes an even crazier face at nicky and starts swinging his fists around
nearby valerie an unsure sweetly unstylish young woman is selling clothes off a spread out blanket
she notices whats going on
nickys eyes widen in panic
just then valerie steps in
excuse me does that flask belong to this man
frustrated now you callin me a thief
look i know you come out here and sell stolen stuff all the time
but today the guy you stole from just happened to walk by and bust you
so why dont you admit todays not your day and give him his flask back
or whatre you gonna do about it
ugly me to death
no but maybe that cop over there might have something to say
valerie points to a cop across the street
the street vendor ponders this for a second then
aw take your dumb ass canteen goofy
looking at valerie and you take your raggedy ass clothes and find a new corner
before i show you what real crazy is
the vendor does crazy eyes again
nicky picks up the flask and the drumstick
ill be seeing you in a few years
valerie gathers her blanket starts walking away and nicky follows her
that was amazing
thanks so much
you didnt have to do that
i get messed with all the time and when i saw him doing that to you i just lost it
i hate when people take advantage of tourists
it ruins it for the rest of us
you think im a tourist
i just assumed
your accent maybe
where are you from
laughs hard she laughs along with him not sure why
why are you laughing
i dont know but i like it
your glasses are nice
they make your eyes look sparkly and big
its fun to look at them
my dads an optometrist
my dads in hell and hes falling apart
its really tough when your parents get older
if i dont save him i dont know what im gonna do
well im sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out
nicky is experiencing new sensations as he looks at her
he hands her the half eaten drumstick
here have a popeyes
this drumstick aint for beatin its for eatin
i already ate lunch
i actually wouldnt mind getting a gelati
could i come with you to getting a gelati
if you want to
a million angry octopus people couldnt hold me back
uh its a deep south expression
they exit the ice cream store eating gelati
its freezing my hands
its not that cold
here let me wrap it
valerie takes a few napkins and wraps it for nicky
just then the preacher walks by
he quickly turns his head sensing nicky
why do you taunt me with your darkness
your evil is stinking up our streets
were all gonna die
he takes off running right into a lamp post
this town is really going to hell lately
nicky nods so what part of the city do you live in
i have an apartment
i dont remember exactly where
my dog knows though
laughs you have a dog
im not sure
id ask him but hes uptown talking to his contacts
beefy is screwing a female dog from behind
remember its not the size of the boat its the motion of the ocean
id love to have a dog
but i go to school full time
it wouldnt be fair to the dog
parsons school of design
i knew growing up i wasnt much to look at so i put my energy into making things that are pretty
whats that pleasant smell coming from your skin
he takes her wrist to his nose
he stares at it licks it
laughs its called comptoir sud pacific
which i think is the french word for coconuts
nicky stops and looks at her
valerie it feels like theres a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach
is that normal
i was concerned
the gatekeeper is near the frozen fall
we hear loud wailing moaning etc
coming from the other side
doesnt sound very good behind there
i hope nickys kicking some ass on earth
the monster is smoking a cigarette and wearing a leather bikers hat
he nods along in agreement
whos sitting over by a rock fishing in a small pool of fire pond
you know i was the one who created hell
i know your wickedness
i started slow though
for years i was just giving people hot foots
actually you can give all the credit for hell to my first wife she was the inspiration
she was an ugly one too
one day she asked me if i wanted super sex
i said ill take the soup
the monster laughs really hard

i cant enjoy anything
i go fishing
i catch nothing

we hear the monster laughing again as we pan down grandpas fishing line to we see a miniature peeper squirming on the fish hook
a giant fanged fish engulfs the peepers body
only his head is sticking out
i deserve this
several eleven year olds stumble out drunk
i just stole twenty five bucks off the bar
how many beers did you have
i had five
im so wasted
they both high five throw up and fall
pan over to adrian sitting on top of a mailbox laughing as he sips from a bottle of peppermint schnapps
when an adult goes to hell thats terrific
but when a child goes
thats why im in this business
adrian looks across the street and sees nicky walking with valerie
valerie is holding up a pair of drawstring pants from her collection
so youre saying make all pants with a drawstring then heavier set gals dont have to feel humiliated by telling their waist size in front of the whole store
maybe you should make drawstring socks for gals with fat ankles
you know whats nice about you
you just seem happy being yourself
you dont try to act cool
you know whats nice about you valerie
up the street adrians eyes redden
nicky looks like hes been stunned by something
your juicy heart shaped ass
what was that
shocked and confused i
i dont know why i just said that
i meant to say that
adrians eyes flashing
ive always wanted to have sex with a gross pig
what do you say we go behind that dumpster pull our pants down and see what happens
valeries very hurt
youre a jerk
she turns and walks away
nicky looks over and sees adrian
his inner voice speaks to him
you shouldnt have come here
please get out of my mind
adrians eyes flash
she stops and turns
nicky raises his fist to resist adrians force
its too much
his middle finger comes up giving her the finger
what the hells your problem
she runs away crying
nicky turns to adrian whos still across the street
adrian you gotta come back to hell
yeah he needs souls to live
when you guys left you broke the gates
we gotta get the gates burning again before he dies
adrian processes this
he should have thought of that before he denied me my birthright
well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him
how about this
i stay here enjoying my schnapps and you go back
nickys body jerks around
nicky fighting control over his body walks slowly and crazily into the middle of the street where he sees a large truck bearing down on him
john and peter get blood splattered on them
peter looks down to see the forms in blood on their clothes
check this out
the number of the beast
they laugh and hi five
dan rather speaks to the camera
over his shoulder we see a graphic of the arch decons face
note arch decon is a made up religious figure that appeared earlier in the script
reverberations from arch decon donnellys shocking speech are still being felt throughout the city
today some disgruntled cast members of the play cats broke the fourth wall in a most hostile manner
a few cats are down in the aisle physically pushing around shocked audience members
but even that does not come close to what happened today on live with regis and kathy lee
the set of regis and kathy lee
so i was driving to work today and some bozo in a cadillac cut me off
oh thats terrible reege
so i followed him
you followed him
i followed him all the way downtown and when he gets out of the car i reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat
you keep a bat under your seat
so i run up behind this guy and start bashing his brains in with this bat and it made me feel happy
did you ever see the yes great movie
i was deniro
the blue haired lady audience is crying
the tv turns off
we pull back to see that we are in
beefy turns to nicky
your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil
what can i do about it
you cant do jack shit
unless you learn your evil powers
nobodys as evil as my brothers
those dudes put the wick in wicked
go get a soda out of the fridge
but those are my roommates sodas
high pitched mocking but those are my roommates sodas
does that sound like a statement the son of the devil would make
nicky ashamed gets a coke out of the fridge and places it on the coffee table
he and beefy sit on the couch and stare at the coke
you have the power to change the cola in that can into any other liquid engine oil bats blood moose piss
you just have to release the evil within you
release the evil
im just saying theres wickedness in you
i can tell from your snores
nicky stares at the can
release your evil
nicky frowns and bites his lip
the can rattles a little
what are you doing
todd is standing in the doorway
beefy runs to the fire escape
i know its your living room night
but can i finish watching the globetrotters game out here
to me its classic comedia dellarte
the tv clicks on
we see todd sit down and look at the tv
nickys behind him
what an odd game folks
the powerhouse harlem globetrotters who normal run circles around the nationals seem to be struggling to find their groove in front of their hometown fans
a globetrotter makes a fancy pass to another player who makes a fancy pass to cornrows who starts doing some vintage globetrotters fancy dribbling
the ref blows the whistle and makes the travelling signal
hes walking get him a bus
oh another awful call
there is no way that was travelling
ref takes ball from cornrows who gets in the refs face
whats with all these crazy calls
you gotta watch that shit we havent lost a game in years
ref snaps just like cassius in the players face
that guy in the striped shirt snaps his fingers like someone i know
the ref mind wrestles four globetrotters to simultaneously slam their heads on the scorers table again and again
it looks like the work of a brother
a black guy
if its cassius yes
nicky races for the door
as the ref taunts the crowd a fan wearing a globetrotters shirt yells out
get your head out your ass ref
the kids came to see the globetrotters win
oh so you wanna lip off to me
unsportsmanlike conduct on the big mouth in the globetrotters shirt
take ten points off for the globetrotters
the globetrotters score on the board goes from to
the kids are crying
the halftime buzzer sounds
the globetrotters walk off the court
the crowd boos
in all my years of basketball i was never so happy to hear a halftime buzzer
folk im afraid if the second half doesnt get any better i expect a full scale riot
a spotlight points to an announcer at mid court
its time for the globetrotters halftime half court heave throw where one lucky fan will have a shot at ten thousand dollars
a brick lands at the announcers feet
and if he makes it everyone in attendance today will receive a free pizza
miguel wearing a big basketball jersey looks nervous
he has a pass on
i aint goin out there and taking the shot
these people have gone crazy
ill take the shot
as nicky runs out on the court peter turns to john
look whos back from the dead
six six six pick up sticks
they high five
the only happy fans in their section
todds baffled looking at his roommate on tv
beefy is watching from the fire escape
whats nicky doing down there
trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on earth
todd looks over suspicious
did you just talk
the court announcer covers his mic and whispers to nicky
you better win these people some free pizza
looks like theyre about to start killing each other
a businessman pushes a very old soda guy down an aisle of stairs
the court announcer hands nicky the ball
he looks at it
release the evil
his eyes get red
staring at the ball it explodes
okay too much evil
bill waltons hair is on fire
i think that ball just blew up
and yes my hair is aflame
turning to sideline could i get another ball
the court announcer throws out another ball
nicky stares at it again with red eyes
i command you not to blow up and go into that metal circle
nicky throws an underhand shot
the ball arcs through the air and is about to go in when the ref comes out of nowhere and swats it away
get that crap outta here
the crowd boos
nicky and the ref stare at each other
i know youre having fun cassius but you gotta come back to hell
look around you nicky
were in hell
the new hell
we see fitzie sitting between two pregnant women raising the roof
as the crowd boos nicky runs over and grabs the microphone
listen up new york
your souls are in great danger
nicky gets hit by a hot dog
alright how about this
i get one more shot
the ref will cover me
i miss it the globetrotters forfeit the game
i make it he doesnt ref the second half and we all start conducting ourselves like decent human beings again
the crowd is silent
and we get free pizza
the crowd roars
bill waltons hair is now burnt looking
i think its safe to say were all rooting for this bizarre and hideous looking man
bill walton reaches over to an old lady sitting near him
he takes off her wig leaving behind her bald head and puts her wig on his head in order to cover his burnt hair
the crowd starts yelling
john and peter are yelling the loudest
the ref walks to half court and hands nicky the ball
you know dad got very sick when you left
im glad hes dying
its my turn now
nickys eyes get red he starts dribbling
beefy is watching transfixed
take him to the hole nicky
todd stares i mean woof
todd looks at beefy terrified
we see cornrows and some other globetrotters are coming back from the locker room
they stop to watch
nicky pushes the ball up the court while the ref plays extremely tight defense
nicky fakes one way then heads toward the basket
the ref stays tight
nickys eyes are redder than ever
he fakes left he fakes right
he dribbles behind the back dribbles between the legs then takes his momentum up toward the basket
he jumps from the foul line and flies through the air
he emits a crazy blood curdling devil yell
popcorn and sodas explode
cornrows cornrows pop open into a giant afro
nickys head starts turning and does a like the exorcist
he ends his flight by slamming down a thunderous dunk cracking the backboards glass into pieces
he hits the ref on the way down
the crowd cheers finally happy again
never doubt my skills
damn i gotta learn how to do that
nicky sees the ref is lying on the basketball arena floor covered in glass
he gets up slowly thats nuts
whend you learn that shit
maybe it was the super devil juice dad gave me
he thought i might need it for just such an occasion
super devil juice
give it over
lets go best two out of three
pulls out the flask no
dad said it was only for me
the ref rips the flask from nicky and drinks
cassius screams like bloody hell as he is sucked out of the refs mouth and into the bottle
the ref slumps to the floor
still quiet until john and peter rush to nicky and bow
nicky peers into the flask
damn you nicky
there aint no super devil juice in here
nicky caps the flask
nicky waves to the stunned but appreciative crowd
a homemade cake is laid out
it reads congratulations nicky
john todd peter and beefy are there
so your fathers the devil youre a talking dog sent from hell and you guys are who
just a couple of big fans of nicky and the work his dad does
by the way nicky

he spins his black sabbath backwards
whats ozzy trying to say there
the blizzard always came straight with his messages
but wrap your minds around this one
nicky gets up and we see his is sitting on a hibachi
he pus on a james taylor album and plays it backwards
i command you in the name of the lucifer to spread the blood of the innocent
john and peter look at each other shocked
no wonder your uncles so weird

nicky takes a big bite of cake

nicky loosens up his neck and makes his head go around degrees
everyone cracks up high fives

im afraid i wouldnt be able to give ozzy the focus he deserves
whoa that chick must be the real deal then
see ya fellas
you better snap out of it soon kid
cause were going after adrian tomorrow
he falls asleep and starts snoring
we hear the sound of three little girls singing ring around the rosie as he exhales
that is the most frightening thing i have ever seen
nicky stands and moves to the window
he looks out longingly over the sleeping city
rack focus behind him we see todd nodding encouragingly in the reflection
which way to the parsons school of design
nicky walks around the corner
sign reads parsons school student housing nicky is standing in front of the dorm rooms
he looks up
scanning the windows he picks up a scent
he sniffs coconuts
nicky goes to the fire escape and starts to climb
his nose leads him
he reaches the window sniffing heavily
a student is standing in the window draped in silks feeling his nipples with his legs crossed like the guy in silence of the lambs
the student is startled
you smell like coconuts
its comptoir sud pacific
makes me feel like a hula girl
which is kinda what im going for
wanna come in
im looking for a girl named valerie who also smells like coconuts
two floors up one window over
good luck with the genital tucking
i dont need luck
nicky floats away
a few seconds later he floats back holding up the flask
nicky nods and floats off
nicky crouches outside her window and peers in
she is up late
working by candlelight on a fantastic design
somethings not working
she drapes a beautiful fabric over another
she smiles at the combination
she is happy being creative
nicky feels his heart swell as he watches her
hes so enraptured he leans forward trying to kiss her
his head bumps the window
she turns startled
she sees the beaming nicky
oh my g d
stay right there
valerie opens the window and sprays a can of mace right in nickys face
oh that stings
my eyes are on fire
nicky stands up and stumbles around
what were you thinking coming here
im not sure but it didnt involve getting blinded with poison
he bounces off the front rail stumbles backward and goes flying over the back rail
we see nicky hurtling toward the street
holding his eyes
oh my g d im so sorry
suddenly he stops
suspended above ground
valerie doesnt hear the expected thud
he floats up but he cant see
are you dead
what are you doing
i think im floating
why would you be floating
i dont know
maybe its because of your sweet voice
am i supposed to not be freaked out right now
because i am
hes floating up
he slows down
i cant see you but i can smell you
and you make me feel alive in a way ive never felt before
cut to reveal hes floating outside the students window
the students dripping candle wax on his belly
you got the wrong window again man
nicky resumes floating up
im over here nicky
to the left
nicky is parallel with her
he hovers in front of her eyes still watering
she punches nicky in the face and he flies back ten feet
look just because youre floating doesnt mean im gonna forget about you giving me the finger
that wasnt me
i was being possessed by my brother adrian
hes the one who call you a gross pig
what do you mean possessed
remember when i told you my dad was in hell
well thats because hes the devil
and he wants to keep his throne for another ten thousand years
which is fine with me but not with my brothers so they broke out of hell causing my dad
and i love my dad very much
so i came to earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and i met you and
well my dog tells me i just might be in love with you
his vision is clearing and he can start to see her
she is totally in shock but still here
okay now i get that deep south joke
valerie joins in
i dont know if i should believe you
nicky starts to drop
you gotta believe me
you gotta believe in the butterflies
okay i do
get back up here
he floats up to her holding out his hand
nervously she takes his hand and suddenly she is lifting off and they are flying
they fly past the empire state building
this is amazing
they soar past some more buildings
the preacher sense something
he looks to the sky then holds the cross from around his neck as high as he can
the hellbeast is above us
hes invading our skies
were all gonna die
were all gonna die
hes kind of ruining the mood
let me take care of that
the preacher is still angrily shouting towards the sky
were all gonna die
a fire hydrant cap turns and comes off
a powerful blast of water shoots out and hits the preacher knocking him across the street into a plate glass window
can we go fly over central park
tonight i want to share the most beautiful thing i could possibly imagine
they fly over it away from nyc
were going to jersey
they float high above the meadowlands
there is an outdoor concert going on
we hear the ozz on stage in his encore
he is singing mr
nicky turns to valerie
i never thought id ever see ozzy live until he was dead
he looks at her please tell me you like metal
sings along to song mister crowley whats inside of your head
nickys jaw drops as he stares at her
my dog was right
im in love with you
they slow dance tighter
the music swells
john and peter look up from their seats far below
nicky sees them while hes holding her tight
they give thumbs up
spring in his step we see nicky walking down the street
he stops and smells some flowers at a korean tommet
the koreans point and seem agitated by him
nicky gives them a friendly wave
in korean moo ya san jie bay
the koreans just glare
a dissonant nervous score accompanies the rest of the sequence
a nut vendor leaves his cart and starts following
nicky looks back a little unnerved
a taxi screeches in front of him
the driver gets out and goes after him
a group of school girls in uniform break loose from their teacher and start chasing nicky
a gigantically fat guy sees nicky run by
he thinks about going after him but decides not to and takes a big bite of a candy bar instead
ten guys playing wheelchair basketball see nicky
they point and start wheeling after him
nicky is putting some distance between him and the mob
whats going on here
but when he heads downhill the guys in wheelchairs start to catch up
they get closer and closer until
nicky makes a last second right turn into an alley
the wheelchairs cant slow down and crash into a double decker tourist bus at the bottom of the street
the tourist on the top level look over the edge to see the crash
nicky is panicking out of breath
a bum radioman rises up out of his cardboard box
the bum raises his bottle and thunks nicky on the head
it doesnt break
what was that for
fifty million dollars
the bum holds up a new york post
it reads monster wanted
and has a picture of nicky
nicky is shocked
nicky turns to run out of the alley but the mob is there blocking the entrance
they start running right at him
he closes his eyes
release the evil
nickys body splits into about five hundred horrifying insects all with a miniature nicky head
the nickysects run right at the crowd and the crows immediately starts running the other way completely freaked out
beefy and todd are watching tv
they look over to see the insects scurry under the front door and morph back into one exhausted nicky
i seem to be in trouble beefy
the shit has hit the fan kid
take a look
been breaking all morning
we see dan rather addressing the camera
at a news conference earlier today chief of police andy shaifer gave this beleaguered city its latest dose of bad news
he revealed that the man who caused a sensation at basketball arena last night is no hero
he is in fact a mass murderer
we see the chief of police behind a bunch of mics
hes holding up a picture of nicky taken at the basketball arena
i didnt murder anybody look
you were really high
i was with valerie i swear
this is adrians work
ive got to find him
i think youre looking at him
we reveal that the chief is standing on a grilled cheese press to keep him warm
on tv this video shows what he did after he left the basketball arena yesterday
scarface shooting his ak
nickys face has been crudely superimposed over his
adrians voice my names nicky and im gonna kill all you suckers for no reason
cut to footage on scarface the chief shakes his head
difficult to watch i know
in response to this vicious crime i am authorizing the largest reward in law enforcement history fifty million dollars to the person or persons who bring this man to me
nicky stands outraged
this is baloney
he superimposed your head onto scarface
which is by far depalmas best work
the pounding increases
im not nicky
im not home
i dont live here
dude its us
let us in
nicky opens the door
peter and john stumble in
theres like a total mob scene coming this way
we hear voices of an approaching crowd coming outside
i thought for sure i gave em the slip
todd i s looking out the window
looks like theyre following a giant trail of bug shit
whatll we do now beefy
i dont know this is a little out of my league
lets get em
what would your dad do nicky
ill meet you at grand central at noon
i command you
john takes nickys head and slams it hard into the kitchen counter
nicky is dazed
that just hurt a lot
ive always wanted to kill someone
can i do it
look at queen latifah steppin up
nicky is in the bathtub being angrily drowned by todd
john and peter watch happily
die grandma die
nickys arm comes out with a thumbs up
the hand drops back in
start on a close up of lucifer
hes holding cards looking at his hand
royal flush you lose
off with the bra
the demons and gatekeeper are sitting around playing strip poker
the gatekeeper takes off his bra
from behind we see his breasts flop out
last time i saw a pair of jugs that big two hillbillies were blowing on them
the gatekeeper throws his hand down and storms out
the monster laughs uproariously
nicky enters and moves to whats left of his dad
arms torso and a head with one ear
dad adrians got the whole city after me
hes always a step ahead

nicky looks very upset
we see john and peter enter frame
looking very nervous
you sure youre down with this
they approach the cops guarding the door
looking for the chief
we know where to find nicky
cops grab john peter and drag them inside
surrounded by prostitutes and criminals in a very hot room the chief of police puts down his bottle of peppermint schnapps stands up and looks at the two idiots
you have what i want
you got what we want
fifty million bones bro
he nods to a deputy who gives them a briefcase of money
thats half of it
you get the rest when i get nicky
but i gotta warn you man
hes not human
we think hes the son of satan
the chief laughs then everyone else does
he walks over and picks them up by their throats
well then i guess ill have to be extra careful
now where is he
we see the big clock on the wall
five minutes til noon
we see john and peter with the briefcase walking into grand central with the chief and twenty five nyc cops
the chief bumps into a filthy bag lady drinking out of paper sack
hey watch it
who do you think you are
never stopping emperor of the new hell
they march through onto the platform for track
we see beefy and todd waiting by the place where nicky usually comes up
it is hot down there
steam and smoke comes out of the tunnels
todd is nervous
where is he
hell be here
just keep your cool kid
they hear footsteps
they turn and see the chief of police backed up by the huge police force
weve been ratted out
beefy and todd turn to see john and peter looking sheepish
that was so uncool
we thought the son of satan would understand a move like this
peter and john high five
okay take these two outside
i can handle this
the police grab todd and put a leash on beefy
the cops lead their prisoners away down the tunnel leaving john and peter alone with the chief
wanna see something cool
the chief inserts a finger into his nostril
then he fits his hand up there
soon his whole arm is up his nostril as he searches for something
john and peter are impressed
the chief grabs something and starts to pull
then out of his nose comes adrian who fully forms as the shell of the chiefs body slumps to the ground
so what time is my brother expected back
they look at the clock
peter is sweating kinda nervous
so even though youre not really the chief we still get the rest of the cash right bro
you know what youll get
an indescribably horrific torture administered by demons for the rest of eternity
but what about the cash
can we keep it or what
sure why not
they high five
adrian smiles and waits
it is real hot down there
we hear a train coming in the distance
a fan circles slowly
they all wait for him
mumbling to herself food stamps
they should call em dude stamps
cause ever time i get one some dude takes it away
we see the homeless lady down the platform stumbling her way towards them drunk
adrian scowls at her
ill let you make out with me for a dollar
but well take that bottle of booze
grabs the bottle laughs hey
peter pushes her away
beat it ya freak
john and peter high five and john swigs from the bag
takes the bag swigs peppermint
adrian raises his eyebrows
we see that the homeless lady is actually valerie in disguise
she looks back tense
john offers adrian the flask
hands it to him
he takes it
heres to fifty million clams
to the defilement of earth and the corruption of its people
knock it back grab nicky and lets get outta this hell hole
adrian smiles at john then raises the bag
he stops just before it hits his lips
he looks at john curiously
it is awfully hot down here
how do you manage to stay so cool
weed lowers the body temperature
stuttering i read that
er science magazine
adrian stares at john
he raises the bag again
this liquid will probably quench my thirst
cool me off
and give you a good buzz
or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity
no it wont
john starts to tremble a bit
oh nicky ive missed you
come on out and say hello
eyes getting red im calling you out brother
adrian is mentally pulling nicky out of john
nicky john wages an epic battle with himself as adrian smiles
as nicky oww
adrian this is very painful
nicky comes flying out
johns body slumps to the floor next to the chiefs
adrian looks in the schnapps bottle to see the flask wrapped in paper
he peeks inside
let me out
you know new hell really only needs one new satan
adrian hands nicky the flask
but cassius could use some company for the rest of eternity
so get in the flask
he puts the flask in nickys hands
the police are escorting beefy and todd through the terminal
beefy starts whining and stops
the cops look down
beefy raises his leg
oh hes gotta pee
a thick yellow smoke shoots out of beefy enveloping the group
beefy escapes and bolts back down stairs
adrian stares down nicky
i wont drink
you cant make me
adrian looks over at valerie
suddenly she comes flying over to him
he grabs her by the throat
we hear a train coming in the distance
of course i can
drink or she dies
nicky is scared unlike you she wont come back from where shes going
let her go
i hear a train coming
the train sound is coming closer
valerie looks at nicky
nicky raises the flash to drink
dont do it
i have to valerie
we see beefy skid to a stop raise his leg and a full size archery arrow shoots out of his penis and tracks right into ahhh
now that hurt the both of us
valerie is able to escape momentarily
adrian reaches for her grabbing her
they both spin and fall down onto the tracks
right into the oncoming train
nicky leaps down onto the tracks wrestles valerie away from adrian and tosses her off the tracks
adrian looks at nicky
see you in hell
the train comes by hitting both adrian and nicky
adrian comes flying through the solid firefall into hell
he looks around
confused theres no nicky
nicky is lying in a huge field of tall very green grass
he sits up and feels his face to make sure its all there
nicky looks around alarmed
he seems to be in a mountain vale maybe in the foothills of the alps
off in the distance floating in the air is a giant birthday cake
nicky stands up and the cottage seems to be floating down to him
the cake lands softly in front of him the door ajar
after a moments hesitation nicky goes in
nicky enters the cake to find angel and two friends jenna and christa
they are doing arts and crafts sort of things on a glass table in front of them
they stare at him
i cant believe youre here
can i just tell you i am so excited right now
she really is
now could you ladies point me to the black palace
i should check in with my dad
nicky trails off as he sees the angels laughing at him
im sorry youre just so cute
do you have any idea where you are right now
the home of eternal damnation house of hades h
maybe try the opposite of that
the angel and two friends laugh and high five
okay can i just ask you something
what do you know about your mom
my brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat
which would explain my chronic halitosis
annoyed a mountain goat
thats really sweet
my mom wasnt a goat
try an angel
which would make you half angel
nicky is floored
what did she look like
well she was about six three only spoke portuguese and had really long grey hair
the girls start laughing
im sorry im totally busting on you
im your mom
nicky is even more floored
jenna has taken a picture of nicky
im sorry but you just had the sweetest look on your face
youre gonna be so happy she did that
stunned how come youre not older
angels dont get any older son
i cant believe you just called him son
oh my g d
this is so wild
nicky is quite baffled
dad is just a pair of lips with ears on either side held up by two forearms with hands attached lying on the throne
gatekeeper lucifer jimmy and a few other demons stand around
i cant see shit
youre all still here right
they all cheer
youll be back to normal in a jiffy sir
i cant believe little nicky came through
he came with you and cassius right
i came through that gate alone
sorry sir false alarm
somebody explain whats going on
puts the gatekeeper in a headlock
youll get nothing out of me
perhaps a titty twister will loosen your lips
he twists a breast
the gatekeeper babbles out the information immediately
the only way to save your dad is for you and your brothers to pass through the gates at the same time before he deteriorates completely
how much time does dad have before that happens
adrian twists hard
and then whoever claims his throne will have unimaginable power
adrian throws him down
all boobs and no balls
i hope you dont mind if i take a seat while i wait for you
he moves to the throne and throws the lips off
he pushes lucifer out of the way
i dont get no respect
ten thousand years
and i never once got to sit here
he sits on the throne and it starts to shake a little
he grins as two horns grow out of his forehead
and this is just a little taste of my power
hells gonna bust wide open
demons get him out of the chair
the demons approach
not so fast demons
there are a couple of million evil souls on earth ready to be harvested
the demons stop
now loyal to adrian
all except jimmy
everyone is sitting around drinking diet cokes
are you adrian and cassius mom too
no their mothers werent angels
i think they were hookers or strippers or something really porno like
theres a knock on the door
it opens and in comes carl weathers dressed as chubbs from happy gilmore
holly jenna christa
time for your mambo lesson
i totally spaced
im so sorry
i have company
its my son nicky
can you believe it
wow thats terrific
nicky this is chubbs
he used to be a golf pro but up here hes the dopest dance instructor
i dont think so
remember its all in the hips
its all in the hips
chubbs dances as he leaves
where did you meet my father
it was a long time ago at some heaven and hell mixer
i remember that night you had like four daiquiris
try four and a half
at first i totally didnt like him
he was really conceited
but i dont know he was funny he made me laugh and i hate to say it but he had a really nice body
and that made you want to make a baby with him
the angels laugh
well i really wasnt thinking about making a baby at the time
her cell phone rings
she answers it
yes hes here with me now
i dont know if hes hot hes my son you perv
ill call you back
laughs oh my g d i will call you back goodbye
hangs up that was my friend michelle she says hi
well tell her i said hi back
angel makes a motion towards the phone then stops
ill call her later
you know we saw you save your girlfriends life
that was so cool
thats why you came up to heaven instead of hell
self sacrifice automatically gets you here
how did you see me
we can see whats going on anywhere on earth
angel and the girls clear the junk from the glass table in front of them
angel touches the glass and it turns into a reflection of earth below
people are rioting in the streets
looting appliance stores
all these good people have totally been led astray
show him central park
people are drinking and smoking and burning things
a large circle has formed around two old ladies who are fist fighting
one old lady knocks the other to the ground then jumps on her and starts wailing away
the spectators exchange money
theres like a three day rave goin on down there
no on is going to work anymore
then suddenly we see the ground start to break up and adrian on his throne start to be thrust upwards
demons swarm around him
welcome to the party
its so nice to see all of you here
hey thats dads throne
how did adrian get that
is dad okay
dad lips are morosely talking to the gatekeeper and jimmy
i was a good devil wasnt i
you were the best devil boss the best devil
i tried to do some interesting stuff
you did amazing stuff
i dont know how you came up with some of it
that means a lot to me
oh my g d
he looks gross
i cant believe i did it with him
she touches the pool again and the reflection changes to adrian steps off his throne onto a small stage flanked by six hero demons
he begins addressing the crowd
im very proud of you
youve taken to sin with minimal prompting
the crowd cheers
youre acting as if there is no heaven or hell
the crowd cheers
we see john peter beefy valerie and todd hanging on flagpoles by their underwear
beefy is in a special fitted harness that looks like underwear
well i have some news
adrian morphs into the cardinal from earlier
there is most definitely a hell
and youre all going there when you die
which will happen in about fifteen minutes
the bad people realize theyve been tricked into being bad and they get scared
the preacher who is now more battered from his fall through the plate glass window ask steve yells out
we really are gonna die
this kicks off a frenzy of the scared bad people trying to run away
but they are stopped and herded back by demons
this dont look good
cant beefy use his penis powers to get us out of this
they castrated him
he cant shoot arrows he cant piss smoke
i cant screw
whimpers i cant screw
nicky is shocked
shes so nice
she goes to parsons right
i would totally love to go there
but i hear its really hard to get in
i gotta help her
i gotta help dad
i gotta help everybody
yeah you do
adrian is looking at a clock tower that reads
at the stroke of midnight my father will be completely deteriorated
and all of your souls will be mine
soon you will see things more horrible than you can even imagine
adrian scans the crowd
the parsons student in the kimono dancing sexily
adrian is thrown
not that horrible but still pretty bad
adrian motions to some of his guards
so while we wait for your enjoyment i bring you a dear sweet man and an international icon
a frightened henry winkler is lead onto the stage prodded by two demons
the scared bad people finally smile
covered in bees
we see henry winkler is suddenly covered head to in a swarm of bees
the crowd gasps
nicky is starting to panic
but how can i win
adrian is stronger and smarter than me
but you have something he doesnt have
a speech impediment
the girls laugh
no you have the inner light
you can totally use it
its the best power of all
he smiles and in case you get in real bad trouble g d told me to give you this
she gives him an ornate jewelled ball
what is it
im not a hundred percent on that
g d said when the time comes youll know what to do
g ds so smart
looks at his face can i just do this
she licks her finger and wipes some dirt off his forehead
that was such a mom thing wasnt it
well nice meeting you jenna christa
to angel would it be okay if i called you mommy
it would be so okay
nicky hugs his mom
well mommy get me to the big apple cause im gonna rock that town like a hurricane
youre already there
nicky dissolves into walking
he checks his pocket to see the ball
he looks up to see fifteen demons marching towards him ready to attack
nicky closes his eyes and concentrates
when he opens them beautiful butterflies are floating around the head of five of the demons
they stop approaching
their eyes turn from white back to normal
and their facial expression changes to happiness
they wave at the butterflies
more demons keep closing
release the good
five more are stopped by something
they look down and see fluffy white bunny rabbits at their feet
they start petting them
the remaining demons advance on nicky
release the awesome
then stop their path blocked by a very large bucket of popeyes fried chicken
the demons consider the bucket of chicken
one demon takes out a piece
put it in your mouth and let it slide down your throat hole
the demon bites into it
he cant help but grin a little
popeyes chicken is ass kickin
the other souls dig into the bucket
only ten minutes left
the dudes on the flagpoles are chatting nervously
one thing i really regret is never having experimented sexually
you mean like experiment with a bunsen burner
what are you talking about
he means getting it on with someone like that freak
the student dancing for a mesmerized demon
back on peter todd and john his name is andrew
i know that guy
of course you do tommy tune
nicky leads his small army of reformed demons followed by butterflies bunnies and carrying the chicken bucket down the path toward the rally
we see they have a golden light haze of good around them
adrian is underneath valerie
you know from this angle youre kind of cute
you think so
why dont you come a little closer and ill show you a better angle
he moves a little closer and she spits on him
opens his mouth and catches her spit
everyone is grossed out
oh my g d he just opened his mouth and swallowed that spit
that turn you on there rupaul
keep it up and i just might make you my queen for a night or two
you want a queen
got one right here
john points at todd
adrian gets closer to valerie
just then a big butterfly appears on his shoulder
he looks down to see nicky standing there with his army
adrian im asking you nicely in the name of all that is good release my friends and get in the flask
is this a joke
its the inner light
and with it we can defeat anything youve got
eating popeyes chicken its true
adrian glares down at the reformed demon
his eyes shoot out an evil ray
the reformed demon explodes into a million pieces
his golden insides splatter on the crowd
the army of good is shaken
another demon lowers his chicken
its not true
the bucket of chicken sprouts legs and runs away
nicky steps forward bravely
okay adrian youve left me with no choice
nicky leaves frame and he flies up towards adrian
nicky lands on both feet standing before adrian
love lifts me up where i belong
demons are ready to attack
adrian waves them off
not bad little brother
lets see what youve got
nicky thinks holds out his hands
a rainbow shoots out onto the stage between them
we see that a cute little chipmunk is standing on its hindlegs eating a nut
the army of good and scared bad people applaud as they see this
adrian nods holds out his arms and a red stream shoots out
he has made a terrible python that comes over and eats the baffled chipmunk in one bite
nicky raises his hand and turns the snake into a row of flowers
adrian raises his hand and a crazed mexican gardner with a lawn mower comes by and mows them down
nicky turns the gardner and his lawn mower into a mother pushing a new born baby in a carriage
adrian turns the baby in the carriage into an evil dwarf who leaps out and starts beating up on the mother
nicky turns the mother into a hot girl dwarf
the evil dwarf stops beating her up and holds her hand
im going to kill you with my bare hands
adrian punches nicky hard in the jaw
he goes flying off the platform
nickys body falls towards the ground
its about to hit when a soft bed of posts and fluffy pillows break his fall
we now see angel jenna christa and seven other girls watching the action on the table
i totally had to do that
yah you did
chubbs is there too
nicky looks up to see adrian flying down towards him
nicky rolls away at the last second
adrian hits the bed hard and bounces up
nicky grabs him mid bounce and slams him back down into the golden brass headboard of the bed
nicky holds out the flask
now im asking you nicely get in the flas
adrian grabs a pillow and hits nicky hard in the face sending him flying off the bed
oh you wanna a pillow fight do you
nicky is an expert pillow fighter
he lands a series of awesome almost matrix like pillow moves
adrian is dazed
nicky finishes him off by tossing the pillow high in the air to him
adrian looks up to catch it and just before it lands nicky steps up and pops him in the face
adrian goes down hard
nicky towers over him
now will you get in the flask
adrian turns to his demons
a little help over here
a bunch of demons advance
we see henry winkler swollen with bee stings valiantly run over and lowers the five from the flagpoles
he looks up and glares at henry
henrys eyes widen
he is covered in bees again
he turns his attention back to nicky who is grabbed by demons
adrian brings the flask to his lips but he wont open his mouth
adrian pinches nickys nose closed so he has to open his mouth
we hear cassius banging against the walls
come on in bro
nicky cant hold his breath and opens his mouth
adrian jams the flask in his mouth and nicky starts to get sucked in
but just before nicky is gone he manages to grab adrians coat tail and yank him into the flask with him
as the flask hits the ground we hear thank you nicky
cause now im gonna bust adrians head wide open
i was going to let you out eventually cassius
sole ruler of hell and earth is what i heard him keep saying
we hear the sounds of a struggle
all the demons and all the people of new york form a large circle around the flask
valerie and the gang make it down off the stage
we hear crazy sounds as the flask starts to jump
the crowd reacts
a big dent pops out from the inside followed by a horrible thud
that was cassius
the flask starts rolling over and over on the road
people get out of the way as if it were real people fighting in the street
they root for their side
kill him adrian
john and peter start beating up the demon
the angel and the friend are praying
we hear banging and beating and yelling from inside and then the flask stops bouncing
everybody outside holds their breath
slowly out of the spout crawls nicky
valerie john todd and beefy and all the living people cheer
the student very happy opens his kimono
the people and demons near him are grossed out
valerie goes tot he very beaten up nicky and hugs him
whered a sweet southern boy learn to fight like that
from my dads side of the family
she laughs and kisses him on the mouth
the crowd cheers
but nicky wont stop kissing her
she starts to struggle for air
nicky presses harder and starts to laugh
the crowd stops cheering
valerie is waving her arms for help
nicky turns into adrian during the kiss
adrian lets her go
and we hear adrians familiar laugh
adrian pulls his head back his tongue is huge and he turns into a giant bat
he lets out a huge roar then flies around laughing scaring people
valerie runs over and picks up the flask
she looks inside
you gotta fly out
i know you can do it
still no response do it for the butterflies
a long beat then butterflies
and nicky shoots right out of the top of the flask and lands on his feet
adrian lands and stares down nicky
the clock is one minute from midnight
adrian swoops down
nicky thinks quick and pulls out the ball his mom gave him and smashes it on the ground
out of it forms metal g d ozzy osborne
hello new york
the bats eyes go wide in fear
ozzy grabs the bat his mouth grows big and he bites the bats head off
valerie hands ozzy the flask
put him in ozzy
ozzy spits the bat head into the flask
the clock reads seconds left
dad is just a very thin pair of lips and one finger
the finger is going up and down on the lips making silly sounds
the gatekeeper the monster jimmy the demon and lucifer are on their backs crying like babies
grand central nicky
hell never make it
you gotta kill yourself
ill just go to heaven
no if you do something bad right before you die
everyone looks around
nicky spots henry winkler
aw man not again
focuses release the evil
henry is covered in bees once again
nicky picks up a big rock and hands it to valerie
i love you
i love you
valerie smashes the rock on nickys head killing him
six seconds left
the lips and finger are slowing down
nicky triumphantly passes through the wall of fire and it starts burning again behind him
and now all the backed up souls fall out on top of nicky
the gatekeeper applauds
the stage the demons and everything that raised from hell now descends quickly into the ground
dads lips form a body around it
dad fills in
the good people of new york cheer
we see john peter todd valerie beefy and the student who of course is dancing seductively
angel is so proud
okay you just saw my son save the universe
dad and nicky are hugging
you came through nicky
i came through for you mom and the butterflies dad
youre back in hell now kid
theres no butterflies here
if you want butterflies you need to be on earth
what about you and grandpa and everyone in hell
nicky i let my butterflies die once upon a time and its never stopped hurting
dad looks up thats right you heard me holly
im still in love with you
angel is shocked
oh my g d
hes totally talking about me
and dont think i forgot about how crazy you get after a few daiquiris
that guy is still a horn dog
dad turns to nicky
listen i got down low
your moms got up high
you take care of the middle
i will dad
but in the words of motley crue this will always be my
home sweet home
he pats him on the back
sorry to interrupt guys but its time for hitlers punishment
let me handle that
lucifer walks over to the closet
and im not using a pineapple this time
he pulls out the flask
dont do it
he shoves the flask up hitlers ass
hitlers face tightens
freeze frame then over the skyline of manhattan
pan up from a moving baby stroller to reveal nicky and valerie both pushing it
we see beefy walking with them
a nice old lady bends down to the stroller
what an uncommonly beautiful baby
such a little angel
only a quarter maam
she tickles the baby
it giggles and a small stream of fire shoots out of his mouth and singes the old ladys eyebrows
zachariah say youre sorry
sounds like nicky sorry
the lady scurries away
nicky and valerie laugh and continue walking in absolute bliss
they pass the preacher who runs towards us
he has spilled his seed
he is multiplying
beware the progeny of the unholy union
were all gonna die
the preacher runs straight into the camera
