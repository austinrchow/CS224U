annie stands at the closed driveway gate waiting as ted repeatedly presses the button
she smiles at a neighbor
sometimes it sticks

the gate starts to open
annie sits in her old shitty car
she lets out an exasperated sigh then sees the clock
the brakes squeak as she very slowly drives away
annie gets out her phone and speed dials lillian
lillian is getting dressed
upscale professional clothes
what the hell does that mean

but i gave him a blow job
well he kept putting it in my face
lillians boyfriend dougie enters the bedroom eating a luna bar in his sweats
hes stretching and flexing his muscles trying to make her laugh
well at least he was honest with you so you dont waste your time with him

annie pulls into an alleyway behind harringtos jewelry store and starts changing into her work uniform in the car
a white blouse and navy skirt

listen im out here with a whole bunch of girls and we had a little miscommunication and our reservation appointment wasnt made
is there any way to fit us in
say no more
the girls happily enter
sotto wow thanks helen
a occasionz bridal shop
whitney and helen are leading the girls down the hall
lillian and annie tail the group
ann dont worry about it
we got in
annie sees racks of wedding dresses
hey you want to sneak off and look at the wedding dresses
oh my god
annie i didnt tell you
guess who helen is friends with
lady lavonia jean st
that famous wedding dress designer thas in all those wedding magazines
as a favor to helen shes going to design my dress for almost nothing
normally theyre like twenty grand
i have to send my measurements to france
annie is a little disappointed
they all stand in a room stuffed bridesmaids dresses
lillians cell phone rings
its my mom
can you hold on a second
she covers the phone and talks to the girls
start looking at dresses
ill be right back
i think maybe you guys should decide anyway and pick out something you like since youre the ones wearing it
nodding have fun
whats up mom
lillian leaves talking to her mom
ok ladies start your french engines
shots of dresses being pulled off of the racks
fighting for the same dress shirts coming off dresses zipped up the back and dresses not fitting etc
annie loves the dress she has on
she talks to herself in the mirror
hi im annie
can i get a martini
what you mean you need to see i
annie in the dress is talking to the bartender
well with that dress on you look about
and turns away right into a gorgeous male model in a tuxedo
excuse me you dropped an earring
an underwear model appears in his underwear
ill get it for her
no i will
ill get it
im a lifeguard
tons of men begin to yell and fight over her
the chaos forces annie to make a dramatic exit from the castle
she runs down the stairs like cinderella into the forest
they men begin to chase her
she runs through the trees out of breath she is face to face with a sexy sweaty lumberjack whs chopping wood
its christian bale
im christian bale
im just chopping some wood i like to do that between movies
they hear the voices of the men from the party screaming for her
i need a place to hide
quick get inside my muscles
i love this sash
they look into each others eyes just about to kiss and hi annie
helen has flung open annies dressing room curtain putting an abrupt end to her fantasy
she is wearing cream colored lingerie showing off her totally amazing body
annie is uncomfortable
look at your cute little boobies
ooh is that the dress you like
i think it will look good on everybody it has a sash a sash
annie this isnt the sound of music tryouts
i told you becca i cant wear strapless
annie and helen come out to see all the bridesmaids arguing
why dont you two shut your traps
no ones going to be looking at us
les just get the one with the shawl m always freezing at these things anyway
i gotta say im still leaning towards the one that i found
it is a very ugly
well what about this one
everybody stops and looks at annie
i think it would be flattering on everyone and we could totally wear it again
the sash comes in different colors not just this one
we cant all have the dress that we want
ive been in a lot of weddings and when choosing a bridesmaid dress you must ask yourself aif invited would i wear this a dress to
the academy awards
a ooo i never thought of it that way
all the girls agree
with that in mind i say we wear this one
helen holds up a dress
the girls like it
or this one
people wear sashes to the academy awards all the time
only if theyre nominated for the sound of music
i think lillian would like this one
well i think lillian would like this one
lillian walks in
im hearing lots of excitement in here
she touches helens dress
oooo i like this one
what about you guys
i love it
the girls all agree
helen dumps the dress in annies arms and follows lillian
i think it might look best in cream
ooh good idea
well that was easy
the girls head back to change
this dress is almost
thats not too bad that sounds about right
no thats what im saying
thats a great price
a occasionz restaurant bridal themed cafe
andrea bocceli music playing
waiters in tuxes etc
the girls sit at a beautiful table looking at mens
this place is kind of amazing
i didt even know it existed
the southwestern cobb is really good
i come here and eat sometimes
great theres a fly that really likes me
they only have salads
so annie whats your deal
are you dating anyone
not right now
i had a boyfriend for three years but we broke up like six months ago
oh i hate to hear stuff like that
it just didnt work out
is that the guy who stole a bunch of money from you and gave you an std
lillian told me
annie shoots lillian a look
im sorry i was just talking about you cause i was worried about you and
no its fine
but he didnt steal the money i loaned it to him
and hpv is really common right now
everyone looks around
around fifty percent of sexually active men and women acquire hpv at some point in their lives and by age fifty eighty percent of women will be infected with a
genital hpv infection
million new cases of hpv affect americans each year
ew its on the butter you guys
the flys on the butter
well i dont have it
very few hpv infections show any signs or symptoms
therefore a lot of infected people dont even know they have it yet they transmit the virus to their sexual partner
everyone is a little grossed out
anyway its fine the past is the past
we werent meant to be
my last pap smear came back normal so thats cule
but you know im dating here and there
do you have anyone in mind to bring to the wedding
oh i didnt even think about that
who needs a date
just go stag and make out with someone there
if you wanna meet a nice man annie you should come to karaoke night at my church
we sing hymns to rock beats
i have the perfect guy for you annie
he went to school with kevin
mike from the fourth of july last year
ooh ive seen him ann
and kevin said he just sold his company for an embarrassing amount of money
but hes totally down to earth
you guys have to meet
im texting kevin right now
i know mike too
megan is digging a dead fly out of the butter
the fly just committed suicide
death by butter
oh my gosh if you guys got married you could live out here and see us all the time
yeah and then pop out a couple kids sit around and talk about nothing while your vagina flaps in the wind like a wet paper towel
sotto oooh i didnt know we were going to hear that word at lunch today
i was set up with ernie
as soon as i met him i knew
yeah annie you never know
annie is lost in thought
she pulls over
officer rhodes approaches
well look who it is
i see your still driving around with busted tail lights
im sorry moneys been tight and
i forgot laughing
youre not gonna give me another ticket for that are you
the reason i pulled you over today is that searching you were driving too slow
backing up traffic
you were going ten miles under the speed limit
thats a moving violation
its in the books
but im just going to give you a warning this time but i do have to um
write some stuff down on a piece of paper
he begins to write
man im hungry
im doing the master cleanse
you ever heard of it

i have finished writing down the things i need to write on this paper
he hands her a business card

she drives off
rhodes wishes he had been more suave
trust me ive been in the jewelry business for a long time
nothing says aim sorry for your loss like a sterling silver money clip
an old woman customer looks at her stone faced
we also have yo yos you can engrave

the old woman walks away as sandy approaches
here you go annie
she and sandy open their checks

petsois juju about my dress

lillian hangs up
steve walks in

i told her you were at the tailors
listen im going on a date
holds up a dress or this
what shes wearing i dont like those pants
whats wrong withem
they give you four corners
annies not following
its when a girls butt looks like it has four corners
its not a good thing
these are my only clean pants
do you have a tube skirt
if you stand like you are right now facing that angle it looks good
she looks in the mirror again grabs her bag and leaves
annie sits next to mike donahue
he is tall dark and handsome
they have cocktails
im not an expert in corporate real estate but ive always been interested in it
so yeah i totally agree
mike smiles he is cute
i have to admit i told becca m not really keen on set ups

i can do that drive in my sleep these days
next time maybe ill come to you
you have got great teeth
i brushem every day
she flashes her teeth
the hostess comes up
your tables ready
mike guzzles down his cocktail as they read their menus
well i dont know about you but since were at a thai restaurant im gonna try the dog
mike laughs at his own joke and continues drinking
so becca tells me you play a lot of tennis
i try to squeeze in a game now and then
we should play sometime
oh yeah i havent rea yeah my games pretty solid
i did win a couple tournaments at the club
i tend to jesus christ
whispers it smells like b

i think its the people
a very effeminate waiter brings them their drinks
here ya go
ill be back to take your order in two secs
whoa get a load of our waiter
m surprised he didnt put pink umbrellas in our drinks
annie laughs but is a little uncomfortable
annie is horrified
mike swigs from his drink
seriously aids is crazy
you dot have it do you
singing neither do i
he raises his eyebrows up and down at her
annie hasnt touched her food
hes eating with his hands and drunk
other patrons are beginning to stare
so i started to get a little chub you know what that is
how could i not with those huge canteloupes waving in my face
anyway i looovee massages am i right
as hes laughing he lets out a huge burp
still laughing whoa ho
i got that from steve martin
still laughing he pats his pockets
i forgot my wallet
annies car pulls up
annie is on the phone looking at the herbal drinks
acalma afocusa asex appeala aleana
she finally picks acalma
rhodes appears holding a bag of mini carrots
hey its me i just had to tell you about my night
oh my god
i thought i heard your car out there
very funny officer
guess somebody thought he was a little more memorable than he was
im a little out of it
im not drunk
call me rhodes
notices her drink trying to get acalma
recovering from a date
finish your cleanse
yeah trying to wean myself back to the really bad foods i like eating
thanks for the drink
beat so are you one of those cops that sits in that same spot everyday and sneaks up on people
a lot of people get up to high speeds on this road
i tell people its better to pay for a ticket than have your family pay for a funeral
thats a very good point
want a carrot
they are leaning on the back of his car eating carrots
what is this
annie pulls out a very dry warped discolored carrot
oh you got the ugly carrot
theres one in every bag
you should eat it
i think you should eat it
there your carrots
he goes to eat it
she grabs it out of his hands
dont eat it
she throws it on the ground
he picks it up
i dont think ive ever wanted to get of out a restaurant faster in my life
yeah i dont go on blind dates
it seems unnatural
i have no idea what am i going to tell my friends who set us up
just tell her the truth
youre probably right
now rhodes and annie are driving in his police car
its an ok job
its commission so its unpredictable
i dont know i always wanted to finish my bachelors but thats kind of financially impossible right now
plus id feel like ninety around all those college students
you know my dad used to say that life is like a hallway of doors
you can stand at the same door forever if you want
or you can open a different door
and that one may not be the right door but ill open up a whole new hallway of doors
anyway it worked for me
i was kinda lost and i opened a door and the next thing i knew i was a cop
and i love my job
i think i get it
or you can always sell moon pies by the side of the road
its a joke
you had moon pies in your car the first time i pulled you over
they are waiting in line
when i get married i dont want the kind of wedding people have these days
i want it to be like a carnival
you know dunk tanks
people win prizes
yeah and you can have elephants trapeze artists and a big scale to guess the brides weight
ok first of all thats a circus wedding and im talking about a carnival wedding
to clerk yeah ill have the number four and can you make that super biggie
they are sitting in the restaurant mouths full of and then she moved to hawaii and now lives with a guy who sells shaved ice
and supposedly she has really long armpit hair now
thats pretty much the last girlfriend i had
well lets just say my last boyfriend that i lived with broke up with me over the phone
then come to find out he had borrowed in my name without telling me putting me in horrible debt that im still paying off
because i cant find him
annie in her car engine running
oh my gosh
its twelve thirty
i should probably
oh before you go
there is something i want to give you
i was gonna wait but i think youll want this now
he jokingly gives her the ugly carrot
well i know youve had a terrible night
he gives it to her
her phone rings
sorry one sec
oh my gosh
can you hold on a sec
she waves at rhodes and mouths
i guess ill see you around
dont forget about those taillights
theyre really starting to bug me
to ted so youre in town
he opens the front door leading annie out again
next time i wont call so late
no it was fine
like i said i mean i was just driving
its cool that we can just hookup and whatever
i love it
i feel good right now
annie pulls in her tank is way passed empty
she looks in her purse frantically
i left my fucking credit card at the restaurant
she picks up her phone and dials
hi donna its annie
um sorry but i just ran out of gas and im gonna be a little bit late
yes i know m really sorry
i will get there as soon as i can
i promise im so sor hello
annie comes running onto the floor putting her tie on
i almost left but they said that you were coming and that you were late
helen is standing there looking gorgeous
i had to come into milwaukee for a charity luncheon right down the street and i thought id come in and say hi
and as the leader of the bridesmaids i thought itd be fun to pick up some little gifts for all the girls
leader of the bridesmaids
um wouldnt that technically be me
well no sweetie youre the maid of honor and were all bridesmaids and out of all of us im the leader
anyway it doesnt matter
um i wanted to get something that we could wear to the rehearsal dinner or something
that would be fun
where are the diamonds
oh well what about a nice pen
or a tortoise shell handled sterling silver letter opener
ok let me get sandy
and annie we really need to start planning the bachelorette
im on it
got some ideas
so ill let you know
annie arrives home from work frazzled to find steve on the couch watching the same home improvement show
wow well i have never seen a transformation like this
this old tour bus is stunning
to annie you got another package from your mom
hey thanks for saving my butt today
like i said ill pay you back as soon as i can
she opens the package
and pulls out a red blazer
but you should always put gas in when it gets to a quarter tank
especially cause you have such a shitty car
can i ask you a question
what do you think of vegas
let me turn this off
vegas is a black hole but i must have it in my life
does that make sense
im just asking because some of the girls are talking about going for lillias bachelorette party and ive never been
now i dont know about weddings
when you go on a bachelorette does the bride pay
no everyone pays for themselves
and you pay for the bride
ok im gonna say no
you cannot afford that
vegas is not cheap
airfare hotels food cars drinks clubs show tickets
remember this morning
you cannot afford vegas
well i could save up for it
no you need to win a contest to go to vegas you had gum for lunch yesterday
ooh anight moves
a can i have this
a lightbulb goes off in annies head
steve holds the blazer out and reads the tag
told you id pay you back
annie runs into her room
she sits down at the computer and begins typing feverishly
we see these words adear bridal partya agreat ideaa abachelorette partya afloridaa asea world
a afree place to stay
she presses send and is very pleased
the phone immediately rings
helen is dressed in cream under a cream blanket
all around her is a ridiculous amount of white glowing candles
there are too many flames
i just got your e mail
well its not just sea world
its a weekend in florida
see when lillian and i were kids we went there and she loved it and has always talked about going back
i think it would really mean a lot to her
we could stay at my dads house he wont even be there
then we could go out at night and got to the beach and then sea world on one of the days
but a bachelorette at sea world
like i said sea world would just be a part of it
well i have been talking to the other girls and i was thinking we should go to las vegas
annies other line rings
oh can you hold on
thats my other line
she clicks over
becca in her shabby chic home office paints a front porch sign that says athe whitmansa
i was just looking at your e mail yore so cute
what about turkey
thats where we went for for my bachelorette
oh well turkeys really far away
its super old though
they have awesome restaurants
its very exotic
have you ever seen aladdin
it totally looks like that
annie clicks back over to helen
helen im sorry can i call you back
just a few minutes
ill call you back
annie clicks over
you know if you wanna go some place closer than turkey
helen just e mailed me about going to vegas
oh i dont know
everybody always goes to vegas
it seems just cliche to me
i never get sick of it
i love blackjack
i have a system
annies other line
oh my other lines ringing
can i call you back
annie clicks over
annie its dana
of course it is
dana is on her porch swing drinking lemonade
i love your idea about sea world
yeah but then helen just called me and said we should go to vegas
but vegas is so hot dont you think
its like hot and dry
people get sick there all the time
i havent had that experience
my skin always clears up there
yeah i just think its probably not hold on
clicks over hello
annie its megan
megan is at work in front of a wall of computer and television screens
it is a technical haven looks like
i cant talk right now but i was thinking for the bachelorette something more along the lines of a personal challenge weekend
have you ever heard of the nevada project
leslie in her sopranos style living room on a treadmill
her kids run around
i gotta be honest
ive been married for nine years this may be the last bachelorette party of my career and i want the sweaty nuggets of a gay man pounding me in the
face at some point during this trip
ill pay whatever i have to pay
to the kids tyler stop it put that back
vegas has these party busses that have flat screens in them and dance floors or we could take hummer limos around everywhere
that sounds really expensive
oh but its gonna be so much fun
besides money shouldnt be a problem if lillians our friend
oh no no i was just thinking about everyone else
thats all im saying
what im saying is they drop you off in the middle of the desert
you have to kill your own food and find your way back
not everyone makes it
i want balls in my face
so i think vegas is a good idea
i agree with helen
oh you know what else is in nevada
vegas it is
on the phone holy shit annie
were goin to vegas
eating a cookie no can do i need all my shifts
m trying to save up and take my lady to maui
please one day a week just for a little while
ive already asked everybody else
i really need the money
my hands are tied
sharitas got my dick in a chip clip
these are the best peanut butter titties you ever made
theyre called peanut butter kisses
thats not what they look like
the bridesmaids sit in first class
in the distance annies head pops up from her seat in row o of coach
the girls wait by the curb with their luggage
megan appears next to annie
here we are
the city of lust
annie do you know how many men are looking for trouble in this town right now
we are gonna nail it down
we should tell everybody were twins cause guys looking up with twins
yeah ive heard that

lillian walks up

oh its no big deal
i didnt want to blow all my money on a first class ticket
im here though right
im so excited
ok you guys gather around
welcome to lillians bachelorette party

waving her key girls get off the elevator giddy with excitement
annie gets back into the elevator
i left my sunglasses downstairs

annie sneaks out rolling her bag
she catches a cab
cab pulls up to a tiny broken down building
a sign reads ahotel rick
a an old man rides a bicycle in circles in the parking lot smiling
lobby is very outdated
wood panel walls etc
the hotel brochure is on the desk
it is probably the picture she saw online it does not look the same
the clerk enters
hi i have a reservation for walker
rick an east indian man stands behind the desk in front of a large portrait of himself posed exactly as he is now with the same outfit
he holds the pose smiling
okay two nights
rick waits for her to notice the painting but she never does
do you want towels
do you need sheets
no pillow though ok
annie just stares at him
the door opens to reveal a gorgeous huge feminine suite
gasp oh my god
annie opens her door holding unfolded sheets and towels
the room is very ugly bare mattress lots of brown
oh my god
megan and leslie stand in their grande bathroom
hot tub plush towels flat screen t
oh my gosh i cant believe this
he llo vegas
theres an old toothbrush and comb by the dirty sink a pair of athletic socks hanging over the shower rod where a curtain should be
there is a cat staring at her
dana and becca open their curtains revealing a spectacular view
they scream and jump up and down
annie opens up her curtains to a back lot
something is on fire
rick tries to put it out
the old man rides by
screams in shock annie stands outside room
she is dressed more preppy than shes ever looked
she knocks on the door
becca opens it
we see disco lights and hear rap music
there are shirtless male waiters penis balloons and a slide show of naked men
the room looks like a sex club
the girls are dressed like borderline prostitutes
oooh annies here

lillian runs over and hugs annie wearing a condom veil and drinking out of a penis straw

lillian pulls annie into the room
helen is getting off of the phone

im looking for a birthday gift for my best friend
your best friend
sip what do you mean
well whats gonna happen when you get older

girl stares annoyingly chewing and sipping
and they buy her facials and designer dresses for cheap and yore stuck selling jewelry to teenagers whs outfit cost more than your rent
you have no chin
youre gonna be a slut in high school
you are an old single loser who has no friends works in a jewelry store colors her own hair and will never know the feeling of owning a luxury car
she sips in victory slurps up the last drop noisily
the girls eyes widen
the camera pans to show that the girls dad and donna have been there the whole time
donna stands across from annie whs cleaning out her locker
she sadly starts to leave
you know i knew a girl once
she was really something
the life of the party a concert pianist she had naturally curly hair and skin black as night

the saxophone outside of a drug store
and im gonna say something to you i should have told her
dont waste your life

donna hugs annie then leaves her in the break room
annie arrives completely depressed
outside her doorstep is yet another package
annie takes it inside
ooh another package from your mom
it is a beautiful pink and white striped box with her name and address in calligraphy
when annie opens the lid acanon in da plays and a real butterfly flies out
she reads aa shower for lillian
a steve comes over to see

so you walk into that party knowing that
annie drives to helens
she sees a pink and white highway sign that looks like a traditional highway exit sign alillians shower rue
this exita oh my god
she turns into the gates of awhitewater estates
a there is a life size sculpture of a bride and groom
as she gets closer she sees they are real life models
they smile at annie wink at her and wave her by
at the next stop sign a butler appears with a tray
are you a guest of helen harris
the shower is one mile away
he hands her a pink lemonade
i dont have a cup holder
as shes driving little pink things start to fly beside her car
one flies in her car
theyre rose petals
annies shitty car drives down a road covered with rose petals
at the driveway she is greeted by a valet in a pink bow tie and beret
as she reaches for her gift from the passenger seat another valet opens that door and take it
this will be placed in the gift room for you madame
he reaches for the cookies she made and she stops him
ill take those
annie watches the valet drives her car away
when she turns back around there is a man with a white horse holding out his hand to her
would you like an assisted ride to the main house
do i have to
an annoyed annie arrives at the house on the horse with the man leading her on foot holding the cookies
the front door is swung open by two attendants
as she enters the mansion groups of girls pass by her
this is the most amazing shower ve ever been to can you believe this
what a lucky bride what a good friend
helens house is all cream and white with gold
couches are puffy etc
annie walks to the backyard
we hear french standards
beautiful tables are set
swans and bunnies milling about
attendants ready to serve
in the middle of everything stands an eight foot tall round asigna that says alillian and dougiea in puffy pink cursive
a waiter offers annie champagne
she takes it
they walk to her
do you believe this shit
annie is still staring at the sign
thats a big cookie huh
they point to the asigna
annie walks closer to see it is indeed a huge cookie
leslie takes a piece off eats it
its even better if you dip it in the chocolate
reveal a glorious four tiered chocolate fountain
girls are around it dipping strawberries and pieces of the big cookie laughing
helen is there taking their praise
annie is pissed and plops her tupperware of cookies on a nearby table
lillian runs to her
under her breath can you believe this
i gotta go say hi to my aunts
she leaves and helen appears out of nowhere again
oh its nothing
just make yourself at home
under her breath asshole
what did you say
i said i love this shower and is amazing
i said all that
two hip hop dancers wearing pink berets approach helen and jam out in her face
ok not me not me
hip hop dance with the guests
annie puts lotion her hands
she sees a magazine photo of face super imposed over them
on the counter is a framed photo of helen soft lit posed with her hand gently face
she also sees a photo of helen and lillian from vegas on the plane
as annie leaves she runs into her mom whs new hairstyle is a bit overdone
you look great
thank you sweetheart
to herself i wish barb could see me now
not today mom
well im happy to see you
ill see you out there
i need to wash the horse off my hands
mom goes into the bathroom
annie did you see the party favors
im sure theyre perfect and amazing
and theyre wrapped up like presents
they said we have to wait until we leave but i cant stop thinking about them
i gotta go tell lillian
annie now stands next to the chocolate fountain
she looks around drops her glass in it and unplugs it with her foot
it stops flowing
she looks around and throws some leaves in it and walks away
attention by microphone
french sentence yay
i am your host helen a bridesmaid in lillians wedding
i want you all to have a wonderful time
eat drink please have some cookie
she laughs and then becomes very serious
todays your day
id like to make a beautiful toast ayou are pretty fun sweet look at all of your friends
a everyone enjoy your lunch served along with the musical stylings of
a quartet all in pink and white and harmonize
a lillian lillian lillian lillian
when lillian was a little girl
a judy claps and enjoys the music
she leans over to annie
i dont know whats going on honey
the shower is a hit
everyone sits surrounded by decorations pictures of dougie and lillian as babies flowers fire in the fireplace
everyone its game time
please take your piece of paper put it on top of your head and with your other hand try to draw what lillian and dougies first baby is going to
everyone draws giggles looks at their stupid drawings laughing
annie cheats and draws it on her lap
and the winner is
dana holds up a perfectly realistic drawing of a baby
yeah thats mine
girls spin a blind folded year old ellie around times then they swing her holding her hands and feet
annie looks confused
they throw ellie onto a huge pile of pillows
this is a terrible game
find the veil
come on look
you can do it
its right there
ellie feels around in the huge pile of pillows
she finds the veil holds it up in victory and then falls down from dizziness
you did it
what is lillians favorite ice cream flavor
write it down
under her breath to the woman next to her ew
kinda smells funny in here
this house has a weird smell
ok last one
for the big prize
what is the craziest place lillian and dougie
helen strongly hints with a weird smile instead of saying a
a shower girls ooooh and ahhhh
under her breath wow looks like someones a pervert
its none of my business
very emotional im putting a blue bead on this aadvice necklacea to represent the ocean
it may not always be smooth sailing but you can ride the waves together
dana cries and takes a picture
everyone applauds to person near her the oceans are really polluted right now

lillian opens presents in front of huge photograph of herself

annie marches into the back yard
shouting we see her through the large did you honestly think women were gonna finish this

ll help you out
she tries to take down the cookie and struggles with it
we watch her from the house
fall over with the cookie she runs over to the chocolate fountain and tries to tip it over its obviously too heavy
she tries to empty it with her hands onto the ground
nothing says friendship like a thousand gallons of hot unsanitary chocolate
hello swan are you having fun
did you enjoy the hip hop dancers
everyone is watching annie
she is fighting and punching the air like a crazy person chasing a swan
a little girl starts crying
annie walks back through the house through the crowd holding her chocolate covered hands in the air
i actually thought i wanted to be like you
and you and you to be a part of this world
thats not who i am
i make bad choices
im broke i lost my stupid job im thirty two years old and i still answer booty calls
i dont like mike donahue cause he on our date
i have a single black hair that grows out of my chin and i cant wear white t shirts cause something about my sweat turns the pits yellow
and you know when we were in vegas
when you were all staying at your luxury hotel
i was staying at hotel rick where got body lice
so helen you can have the coveted maid of honor title
you can have it all wrapped up in a big pink obnoxious musical box
because all its brought me is a big pain in my ass
annie leaves and lillian runs after her
i dont know whats going on
well let me fill you in
ever since you got engaged my life has turned to shit
im sorry the the happiest time in my life has brought you so much misery
do you know how selfish that sounds
youre the one thats been so wrapped up in all this
designer dressed extravagant hotels this shower this is not you
this is my wedding and youve made it all about you
well at least my friendships not for sale
this hangs in the air
annie storms off
lillian storms back inside
do you think she still has body lice
anyone else have something they wanna say to me
dana cant contain herself
i got my chin done
becca stands up
kevin smokes pot
leslie stands up
megan stands up
i took two dogs already
there in the back of my van
annie is pissed
she sees a squirrel in the road close up of squirrels big eyes
she tries to avoid it slams on her breaks and boom
annie is rear ended
the driver behind her backs up peels out and drives away
her car wont start
trying to keep it together she grabs her running shoes from the back seat and storms down the highway trying not to cry
a cop car pulls next to her
rhodes is looking under her hood
well i cant say im surprised
you shouldve taken it to my friend i know
yes youre friend
but i didnt ok
i didnt get them fixed
i dont whoa
dont take it out on me
this is your fault
he hit me
you had no taillights
you didt get them fixed
you dont get to blame anyoe else
its your fault
annie starts to walk away
where you going
annie keeps walking
oh youre going to walk fifteen miles
another wise decision
what do you know
i know that you not taking responsibility is why were standing out here
you did not make an effort to fix that problem
this hits annie
rhodes is physically worked up
why are you yelling at me
youre putting your life and others in danger
he calms down
look all i know is that youre kinda crazy
youre always stressed out or late complaining about something and now youre yelling at me
and for some reason all ive ever wanted to do is ask you on a date
well save yourself the trouble and dont
yeah im not much of a hickey guy anyway
annie remembers her hickey
he saw it
well i have said anoa anyway
well then you have yourself a good night maam
annie regrets that
he drives away leaving her there
she is alone
annies car gets towed into the shop
bill enters with a clip board
he is a stocky milwaukee good guy
rhodes told me a while back you might be stopping in
im bill cozbi
i was beginning to think wed never see ya
yeah i know
nah no one likes taking care of that stuff
but you are going to have to leave your car here for a week or so
so you kind of had a bad time at the wedding shower
yes i did
she starts crying
steve hands her a tissue from the middle console
im sorry i just this has been a really shitty day
ok dont get mad at me but it seems like you have a lot of those
yes i do
have you considered the idea that maybe possibly perhaps its you that makes them shitty
annie stares at him
im just saying maybe its your attitude
this is not about attitude
its just the facts
my life hasnt turned it out the way i expected
i dont have any of those things that gives a person points in the world
i think that might be your problem
i think you read too many of those magazines
you dont need things to be someone
tyra said that
annie sits on the couch with steve in a daze watching lillian
she doesnt even know what to say so she doesnt answer
annie reads a shitty magazine at the counter
she turns to see the gray haired outdoorsy woman that she and lillian pointed out
is anyone sitting here
the lady sits next to annie and smiles at her
annie looks in the classifieds
a lot say acollege degree required
a she looks up and sees ted has walked in
oh hey ted
youre in town
listen im going out tonight but i should be home around you wanna come over
ted smiles at her
annie stops herself
i dont think i do
because answering your booty calls and having you kick me out after a night of no strings attached sex doesnt feel good
no girls feel good after that and if they say they do theyre lying
but its not your fault
have a great life
and you can keep the plant
annie grabs her stuff and leaves
she lies on her bed staring at the ceiling
she picks up the phone
lillians phone lights up its on silent
she is names cut out and being placed at different tables
her mom laurie helen and two women argue about the seating chart
lillian looks distraught
annie sadly hangs up
tim the owner is sitting with annie
well i cant think of anything else to tell you
did you have any questions
no i think weve covered everything
im really excited and thank you
annie gathers her things
ill see you next monday
what time do i start
annie is a little surprised
youll get used to it
annie smiles back
i wont be late
oh and i wanna try one of those moonpies
annie weaves through the crowded hallway approaches a window
hi im here to inquire about financial aid
her cell phone rings
take these to the second window
annies trying to find her phone
the second window
its too late she looks at her phone
it was lillian
she doesnt call her back
annie gets out of steves car
parts and labor were lookin at eight hundred dollars
but with your discount
rhodes and i worked out a deal way back when so this ones on the house
are you serious
i owe him big time
he runs background checks on all the guys my daughter dates
theres been a lot of em
if you see him would you thank him for me and tell him that im crazy and im sorry
hell know what you mean
annie drives past rhodes at his post flicking her brand new taillights
he sees her but doest respond
pull her over
she drives by him again and swerves all over the road
he really wants to pull her over but he doesnt
she goes back one more time throws a bunch of trash and diet coke cans out of the window
he still ignores her
she gives up and goes home
t get to this point until this morning
wanted to see if were going in the right direction with annie uniting bridesmaids and saving the day
annie and steve are in the kitchen shs cooking
steve reads out of the college brochure
ok you can take womens studies or spanish
oooh the history of wine
the phone rings

annie hangs up grabs her keys
she stops comes back and grabs a small paper bag and runs out the door
what about the science of jazz
annie pulls over
she puts the piece of paper in the small paper bag
she gets out of the car leaving it running
a few seconds later she comes back without the bag
takes a deep breath and drives away
maybe shes at the park
dont be stupid dana
jeez take it easy
well its closed is all im just saying
maybe she flew somewhere
everyone always hides in mexico

all the girls start yelling
helen loses control of the car for a split second and drives off the road hitting something
the girls scream
she pulls over
all the girls are wide eyed and speechless
what was that
did we hit something
was it a person
guys its just a flat
ive gotten tons of them
annie goes to get out of the car
annie dont get out
its pitch dark out
everybody calm down
you dont call for a flat tire
a huge truck drives by moving their car a little bit
the girls scream
helen put the hazards on
helen puts them on
im calling aaa
im calling kevin
helen do you have a jack
what if we get hit just sitting here
or kidnapped or chased by an animal
dana calm down
i dont have any service
oh my god
were gonna die
annie has had enough and gets out
the tire is definitely flat
she opens heles trunk lifts the bottom wherever the jack is in an escalade she goes up to the window
everyones gotta get out if you want me to fix this
they complain that its dangerous is cold but they do
annie puts the jack under car
so how can i help
hold the flashlight
leslie and megan watch as annie pumps the jack
she really does know what shes doing
the car is raising
megan hand me the wrench
megan hands it to her
annie starts to unscrew the lug nuts handing them to megan with leslie by her side
dana and becca stand with helen
thats pretty cool she knows how to do change a tire
i cant believe shes doing it
dana and becca move over to annie
helen waits alone
just dont scratch anything
the girls are all crouched down to watch annie in awe
so what are you doing now
im removing the lug nuts so we can take the tire off
how does that little thing lift the whole car
it uses hydraulic power
it gives a human being the lifting capacity of
to three tons
how do you know this stuff
i like cars
theres a real artistry to them
are you guys working or talking
we dot have all night
quickly annie is doing the best she can helen
so why dont you just stand over there and be quiet and wait
she has had it with helen
i said will you for once shut the fuck up
dana approaches helen
the other girls are standing now
lillian probably left because of you anyway
youre so bossy
youve been acting like youre in charge this whole time
dot you realize how much pressure shs under
you know lillian did not want to leave her reception in a unicorn drawn carriage
she said athats not me
a and you ordered it anyway
youve been pushing her this whole time
annie was right
helen glares at megan
what are you talking about
the only reason youre even in this wedding is because youre the grooms sister
id rather be the grooms sister than have cameltoe from my pants
we see that helen has cameltoe
megan has surprised them
why is everyone attacking me
i wasnt the one who caused a huge scene at lillians bridal shower and made her cry
everyone looks at annie
i hate to interrupt this riveting discussion but a really creepy guy in a trans am just pulled over
the guy gets out of the car
he is thirty ish wears at shirt with a cat on it and camouflage shorts
hey its pretty late
what are you ladies doing
becca and dana scramble into the woods
leslie gets behind the car
just changing the tire
you guys need some man hands for that
nope i think we got it
but thank you
he doesnt leave the girls worriedly look at each other
look if you guys get tired i live right up that hill
you ladies can just leave your car here come on up and let us all lay down together
he starts to walk toward them
the girls are scared
annie gives megan a look
megan tries to distract him
are those snowflake rims
the guy looks at megan
yeah found a em in a junk yard
restored a em myself
i bet you got a formula oo under there
someone knows her cars
im in the firebird club
you dont say
i never met a lady in the fbc before
he walks over to megan she gives annie a nod
annie rushes to the tire and quickly continues changing it
you ever make it up to the trans am nationals in dayton
becca dana leslie and helen are huddled together
they talk in a loud whisper
i can hear animals
the guy is moving closer to megan
remember smokey and the bandit
its my favorite movie
agive me a diablo sandwich and a dr
pepper and make it quick
im in a goddamn hurry
a he leans into her
why dont you show me whats under the hood
back at helens car
leslie sneaks over to annie
hows it comin
the guy has lifted up his hood and megas looking
he puts his hands on her ass
you wanna get in the backseat
he is really getting aggressive pushing against her
hey take it easy
hey what about me
he turns around to be hit with a huge piece of wood by helen
oh my god
annie is frantically releasing the jack
ok everybody in the car
megan helen lets go
all the girls scramble in the car helen starts it
annie is finishing
annie get in
im gonna get you bitches
he is coming towards annie
she turns towards him with the jack
or i will shove this jack so far down your throat you will shit out
i live up the hill though if you change your mind
annie backs up and jumps in the car
helen peels away
the girls drive away fast
the girls still driving
megans eating chips
megan i was freaked out when he leaned up against you
that was a pretty gutsy move
annies the one who tried to make him eat a car jack
helen hit him over the head with a tree
they all continue talking helen and annie smile
there it is turn left up here
go down the little hill
ok thats the driveway
its dark and very rustic
its lillians lake house from the flashback
where lillian and dougie met
god i havent been here in forever
the house is right up here
they pull up to a small cottage and get out of the car
her cars not here
doesnt look like any lights are on
shes not here
annie is sitting on the front step defeated
i thought shed be here
i really thought shed be here
annie its ok
no its not
i dont know what happened
i messed everything up
lillias not even talking to me
i think im so afraid to see whats really happening
lillians moving on to this great life and i feel left behind
and know matter how hard i try i dont fit in to her life now
everyone is silent
annie lillian loves you
beat i know i havent made things easy for you
i dont have a life and i am bored
perry is always away and im constantly alone and shes been there
and ive been a bridesmaid nine times and although i may have implied it i
ive never been a maid of honor
i wanted to make everything special for lillian because
i dont have a lot of friends
i wanted her to like me better and to impress her and everyone else
and im just good at throwing parties
i always have been
in fact sometimes i think people only ask me to be in their weddings because of that
lillian wouldnt do that
if she asked you to be in her wedding its because you are her friend
dana is crying and takes a picture
there both startled by the flash
im sorry about the sea world tickets
im sorry that when i left the shower i told your neighbors you were shooting a porn
oh i didnt know that you did that
oh well sorry
i deserved it
i must say you do put on some pretty spectacular events
well im really rich
it is getting pretty late
what should we do about lillian
shell come home when shes ready
annie enters exhausted to find lillian sitting against her door
annie walks up and slides down to sit next to her
after a minute
didnt mean to make anyone worry
i really am sorry
im sorry too
i didnt want things to turn out like this
i got so caught up in the frenzy of everything wanting this one day to be perfect
well its easy to get caught up
and it doesnt help that all my friends hate eachother
but its all good now
we all talked and everythings cool
yup helen and i are best friends now

shes really not so bad
i just wish the wedding hadnt become about everything and everyone else but me and dougie
and now its become this thing i never wanted
i did want simple
i wanted colored lanterns twinkly lights and food everywhere
i wanted a dj to play all those stupid wedding songs
its not too late to have those things
im sorry i didnt know all the stuff you were going through too
annie is clearly sad
i just feel really lost right lillian hugs her
nothings going to change
oh god dont say that
i mean between you and me

this could be your last chance as a single woman
the small paper bag sits on the side of the road
cop car pulls up

he picks it up and it says aofficer rhodesa
hes a little weary but opens it and pulls out a note

becca and kevin are slow dancing happily very much in love
leslie and paul dancing with two boys trying to join in

annie sees the hotel shuttle
oh i want to catch this shuttle back to the hotel

they hug goodbye
she runs down the stairs
i will see you in a couple weeks mrs
lillian waves goodbye and turns to go back inside
annie runs towards the shuttle
shes too late
the shuttle drives away without her
she just missed it
the shuttle is gone but theres something that was on the other side of it

its rhodes leaning against his car like jake in sixteen candles
annie is all smiles and walks up to him
how did you know i was here
it was really complicated
i remembered the name of this place i called them up told them i was a cop calling on official police business doing a very big investigation and uh made
them tell me all the weddings they had planned for the next two months with a bride named lillian

he opens his hand to reveal the ugly carrot
he stops the car and unlocks the passenger door
she gets in
they drive off into the sunset
