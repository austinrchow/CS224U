written by jeffrey scott richards a nervous leg shakes under the table
the appendage seems to be attached to someone who has a lot on their mind
louis a college student in his late twenties stares at a friend who is sitting off screen
louis is calm almost villainous in how collective he is
he stares at this unseen friend trying to assess the cause for his anxious state
smug something is bothering you
we finally see quinn also in his late twenties
he is obviously uneasy about being out in public with this person
i appreciate the faux concern but im fine
louis is taken aback
my concern is genuine
with our history can you honestly say you care about my well being
yes i can our connection is a product of destiny
i have no ill will against you
the stephen speilberg film
no there was that little french girl i liked
you violated her and torched her farm killing her family
actually you are jacking up the story i violated her father in front of her
then i torched the farm
that makes it ten times better
quinn that was war people do crazy things midst of wide spread conflict
i have gotten jaded over time
its not like the dark ages when i had style
when you would rape the horses and ride away on the women
yeah i was such a ham
beat quinn this is what we do
i have gotten carried away in the past but now im tired
i just want to get this over with
its our calling we help bring order and balance to the universe
beat maybe i would feel less removed if you would let me win just once
this isnt a s boxing match
if i take dive im not lining the pockets of some bookie
im bringing on the apocalypse
louis takes a drink of his coffee
see at least our obligation would be over
louis i might be nervous but i accept my role as savior of this world
beat we have been doing this for years centuries and in days we will do the same thing we have always done
beat well fight to the death
we pan across the cafe to the table of zoey and rick a young college aged couple
zoey is obviously trying to have a serious conversation while rick hides behind his laptop using it as a shield
im not saying this is an intervention
rick doesnt look up from his laptop screen
wouldnt there be more people here if it was an intervention
see and i dont want it to be disinterested thats because its not its just
are you gambling again
totally removed nope
the laptop and you never go anywhere with out it its my lifeline yeah well
i just know when i met you i saved you from that downhill spiral
the online poker
im not a project you know that right
of course not
i never said you were
because you act like it
i wonder if i didnt have this so called problem if you would have even been interested in me
of course i would
i just take it upon yourself to save people
honestly we have to save each other who else is going to do it
continued to be removed people could just save themselves
is that human nature
people rely on false deities self help books
rick the day i realized we were alone in the universe was the day i realized we have to be there for each other
beat plus dont you find it romantic that i want to save you
like a movie
so our relationship is like a romantic comedy
dreamy a cameron crowe romantic comedy
so do you want to see what im doing on the computer
zoey feels like she has broken down the wall
rick spins the computer around
check that out lloyd dobler
shocked is that
like you tube
but with porn
us having sex
rick reaches over and points at the laptop screen
i love the part coming up
beat you know where i put your legs behind your head and yell hump bunny
im not ok with this
im also breaking up with you
yeah not working any more for me what the hell
how is it not working
you are yelling
you know i dont like confrontational situations
im not trying to be confrontational
you are breaking up with me
can i have my laptop back now
zoey still confused slowly turns the laptop back toward rick
looking at the screen this part is fucking priceless
zoey is bewildered
louis kicks at the ground almost as if he was searching for something
his foot finally rests on a broken tree limb
he places his foot under it and kicks it up to his right hand
this will do
he throws it over to quinn who catches it in one swift move
so what are you wanting to do
louis searches around for a stick of his own
i figure we would train
louis finds what he is looking for as he spins his limb into attack position
because you dominate me every time beat ohh that sounded dirty so you want me to help you get an advantage
no i want you to help me put on a good show
everyone loves a good climax quinn
zoey sits on a bench beside her best friend anna
zoey is completely distant as annas words pass through her into thin air
you know i dont like interjecting myself into other peoples affairs but barley paying attention but youre going to you let rick do this to you
snapping to it how so
you think you can change the men you are with
you cant get into a relationship with someone in the hopes that you can mold them into the person you want them to be
rick needed someone stable rick needs castrated
thats slightly strong
he was an asshole
misunderstood ok ill meet you half way
beat you have been repeating the same cycle your whole entire life
now thats a little off base
a young boy is sitting on another little boys head
it looks like he is passing gas on him
remember billy who used to give kids the dirty bomb
you took it upon yourself to change this behavior the boy is now doing the same to zoey
this put you right in the cross hairs to be his next victim
zack a young teenager is selling drugs on the street corner
his bags of coke should be exaggerated as well as the customers coming up to buy from him
think if south park was crossed with hbos the wire
good old zack the neighbourhood drug dealer zoey takes zack into a room labeled rehab on the door
you took it upon yourself to be his personal savoir
what did it get you
zack is out with zoey when a few of his old gang friends show up looking to collect
zack opens his pockets to show he doesnt have any dough on him
well when zachs old business partners wanted to collect on a debt zack slowly pushes zoey toward them
a few days later we see zoey being used as a human coffee table as the gang uses her back to cut cocaine
they used you to replace their missing coffee table they broke during a drunken party
a gang member looks directly into the camera
he smiles showing his golden grille
and then you have toothpick
what kind of name is toothpick
it was his gang name
its prom night and toothpick is in his pimp tux
he takes a swig of his while he dances with zoey
we wont talk about prom night
needless to say it wasnt romantic
toothpick and zoey are in an hotel room
toothpick is standing over zoey who is facedown on the bed
it appears he is urinating on her
its hard to tell with the black censor bar
exaggerations accurate account of events
the story of your romantic life unfair
because these people need someone who is going to sacrifice their own needs for them
who else is going to do it
were alone in the universe
if we are going to make it through this crazy world we need to look out for each other
i think you use atheism and the whole we are alone in the universe jive to justify your actions
beat i regret taking you to see dawkins because you use that as a fall back to be codependent
first of all you are bitter about the whole dawkins thing because you flashed him your tits and got us kicked out you didnt even know the first thing about
the god delusion until i gave you a copy and someone who was huge supporter turns her back because richard dawkins didnt like her nipple piercing playful banter enjoy your suite in hell non believer more banter enjoy your delusional life there fence sitter
how about you pray to thor to hit me with a lighting bolt so i can be removed from this asinine conversation
youre hiding behind this religious debate because you dont want to admit you have always gravitated toward the wrong type of guy
zoey is staring off into space
detached i actually stopped listening to you
what are you staring at
zoey points at quinn and louis who are fighting with tree limbs in the distance
who are those guys
the one closest to us is quinn
very weird socially awkward type of guy
i dont know who his friend is
what are they doing
i dont know
looks like that stuff my ex rob was into oh that medieval rugby style game yeah the made up sport from blood of heroes
beat so quinn
what else do you know about him
oh no you dont
this is exactly what i was talking about
anna senses something in zoey that she is trying to hide
wait a second
youve already established contact with quinn
what is this mi
you have your sights on him already
no im just curious
zoey is overcome with emotion as she makes her way down to the riverside
she is holding something tight in her hand
as her hand opens a class ring was digging into her palm
it appears this might have belonged to rick
still teary eyed zoey angrily throws the ring toward the river
a gust of wind causes the ring to curve and it slams into the temple of a man sitting on a park bench
zoey walks over to apologize and meets quinn for the first time
making her way to the bench im so sorry quinn rubs his temple and then reaches down to pick up the ring
handing the ring back to her is this yours
she takes the ring and shoves it into her pocket
again im so sorry
no need to apologize
quinn scoots over and motions for her to sit
do you want to sit
unsure zoey sits still apprehensive
reaching her hand out im zoey
he returns the gesture quinn
yes most people have interesting stories behind their names
honestly i have nothing
not sure why my parents did that
smiles i suppose thats a compliment
so ive seen you around school but never really
i dont go to marshall i live near the campus though
oh well so what do you do
as in profession
i dont really have one
rent is insane around here
yeah my father provides for me
thats pretty cool
whats he into
so do you like coming down here
to the river
smiles yes where we are right now
i just needed to think
yeah me too
i just suffered a break up
no its ok
i mean im over it
laughs my head disagrees
its really ok
so what did you need to think about
i mean if im not prying of course
no i just have some problems
beat im not sure about my calling in life
im not sure anyone is
you know if you need a friend id be glad to
well you know
id appreciate that
i dont have many friends
trying to double back i mean
ive seen you around campus
you seem like a loner
i didnt mean you were a loser
loner is kind of sexy loser
well can kind of be too
no its ok
i agree it never hurts to have a friend
so we can maybe go out to dinner if you want
and i can pay you know
make up for the head
you really dont have to
no i want to
beat good lets meet up tonight
my place pm
jack a year old gay man who loves him a good cosby sweater is sitting at the computer desk surfing on the desktop
anna walks up from behind and runs her fingers through jacks hair
so when does ted bundy get here
we follow anna across the room where she plops herself down on the couch
i promised her we would behave
a knock is heard at the front door
although knocking right as i sat down doesnt endear him to me
jack gets up from the desk
you sit your pretty little ass down hooker
anna adjusts herself back down into the comfy couch
this is why i dont need a boyfriend
you are way to good to me
jack opens the door to reveal quinn
look at this mother fucker
he rudely motions him to come in and sit down
zoey is in the bathroom getting ready for a night of manipulation sit the fuck down
in almost the same beat zoey walks into the room
quinn is he being rude
looking at jack no quite pleasant
zoey reaches out her hand to help quinn off the couch
looking at quinn i will call the state police in a fucking heart beat if she isnt here by midnight
still confused anna grabs the remote trying to ignore the situation
anna you going to call the guard dog off
out of it david smiths candytakers is on tonight
im relaxing and not getting in the middle
to jack and anna nice meeting both of you
get the fuck out
to jack and anna dont wait up zoey and quinn leave the apartment as jack stares daggers
zoey shuts the door and then turns to stop quinn
sorry about jack
i like him
zoey and quinn are enjoying their meal at this fancy upscale establishment
quinn picks up his menu running his finger down though the menu items
zoey i would be more than happy to pay
no not at all
this is on me
i can cover dessert at least
listen quinn im an atheist so you dont want dessert
no i just wanted to get it out of the way
it bothers people i mean in this state especially
quinn puts down the menu
it doesnt bother me
i dont believe anyone is truly an atheist at the end
im pretty sure im really an atheist
because im a logical thinker
beat i dont mean to offend im guessing youre religious
one supports the business they are in i guess
oh my god you are in the ministry
smiles kind of
my father was a fire and damnation preacher
beat sorry i dont mean to rock your world
smiles you didnt
you poor thing
you are probably so desperate for friends laughs what
have you thought about st johns wort
you are a very cryptic speaker
no im thinking out loud mostly
i was just
you have some social awkwardness
well you are latching on to religion to make you feel whole
it doesnt make you feel whole or at least as whole as you thought it would you are kind of right on that one
so you are out with me
i represent everything you were brought up to combat
youre missing something and you are looking for help
i am looking for help
im out with you though because im interested in getting to know you
smiles see im good at reading people
rolls eyes smiles kind of
i dont know quinn you seem like a lost soul
i thought that when i saw you by the river
you like lost souls dont you
yeah i actually do
someone needs to save them
you going to save me
if you let me
i think you might be able to
endearing smile so what do you need quinn
jack is passed out drooling on the couch
anna and zoey are cross legged on the floor in the midst of girl talk
i dont know he seems fishy
he seems harmless
i have heard that a million times
hes in the ministry and you hate organized religion
i know and hes understanding of that
plus its to my understanding he didnt actually admit what he did
he just did a bunch of double talk
it was understood
not feeling confident in your choices
be careful this time
quinn is sleeping in his bed
his room is rather bare with the exception of the basic living necessities
it almost appears like a room at the y
a foot is seen kicking the bed startling quinn
quinn flies out of bed and sees louis leaning against the wall with his arms crossed
where were you last night
getting his bearings out
youve done a lot of mopping and thinking over the centuries
it kind of brings me down
so what do you need
louis and quinn walk out into a huge open field
louis is carrying a black tote bag that he drops on the ground
now this is a place for a climatic battle
quinn points at the bag whats in the bag
you will love this
louis goes to the tote bag and starts to unzip it
i went to the toy store last night and picked these up
he reaches into the bag and pulls out two nurf style swords out
nothing like our real stuff but it will do
louis throws one of the swords to quinn
catching it its kind of lightweight
louis comes over carrying his sword
come on give it a chance
louis comes at quinn and his instinct kicks in
the two begin their mock battle
from behind a tree we see ryan blood for the first time
he hides in the shadows taking pictures with his digital camera
quinn and louis continue to practice unaware of the unwanted attention
louis sips his coffee while quinn just stares out the front window
it almost as if he is searching for something
you have not been lively at all this go around
a lot on my mind
we only do this once every seventy years brother
you have to enjoy it while it lasts
louis our whole purpose here is to show up and over time establish a social base and then kill each other
you know and im very good at the social base part and you are not so good
thats because you find a way to screw it up every time
thats because i know this is news to you i represent evil
heres the thing though im tired quinn
i really want to stop being the ambassador for this
thats something we agree on
im tired too
i dont know if we can get off this train
its just a viscous cycle
letting you win is not an option
i wasnt going there
quinn is sitting on the couch as jack and anna make their way for the door
you guys leaving
zoey comes out of the kitchen with a bowl of popcorn
yeah we dont want to interrupt your date rape
anna hits jack
he cant do anything here anyway
too much exposure
witnesses my friend
we knew he was here
zoey sits down and hands the bowl to quinn
will you guys stop
i like your friends
anna walks over to the couch
zoey says you are in the ministry
you are or you arent
at some point you will have to explain it to zoey
i mean dont you agree
put out will you guys leave
jack grabs anna by the arm and leads her to the door
who is going too far now
date rape trying to make a point bye guys
anna and jack mumble as they head out the door
turning to quinn sorry about that
its really ok
jack puts his arm around anna as to stop her for a second
you know i hate him because its my nature but you think i hate him because of my distrust of men
tragedy changes people it effected zoey in one way
you in another
yeah beat smiles i became a fag hag zoey is curled up next to quinn on the couch
a popcorn bowl is squeezed in between them
she reaches over and picks up the remote
tonights feature presentation is i am curious yellow
probably not the best date movie but i always show this to ever guy in the beginning
its ok this will be my first film experience
yeah ive never seen a film before
i mean i know of films cant live in this world and not
ive just never seen one
this might be a little hard core for your first film
no its ok
zoey shakes her head
i feel like im stealing your virginity here
zoey slowly looks over at quinn
youre a virgin too arent you
quinn shrugs oh my god
im a bad girl
quinn puts his hand on her shoulder
smiles you are not
quinn motions to the tv
please play the film
i mean i usually play this for potential boyfriends
if they can handle this they can handle me
zoey hits play on the remote
i guess youre lucky i thought about they call her one eye
to herself i hope this doesnt jack you up
quinn is sitting cross legged in the middle of the field
he seems as though he is in the middle of a trance
monotone i am curious yellow
louis walks up and throws a toy sword on quinns lap
what the hell are you talking about
quinn stands up and grabs the sword
the two start to sword fight but quinn does not have his heart in it
you half asleep quinn
quinn stops for a second and drops his sword down to his side
louis pokes quinn in the chest with the tip of his sword
look at that ladies and gentleman the apocalypse has begun
quinn sits down
have you ever seen a movie
louis follows his lead
ive seen plenty of movies
yeah i watched the sorrow and the pity at marshal the other day
you know people here have yet to figure out we are not students
i think they have a pretty good idea
so in all the times we have been here you havent gone to the cinema
its not what we are here to do
in your bosses name what is wrong with you
youve got to enjoy yourself
you might be chosen but you have needs
we all do
i have to stay focused
youve also burned yourself out
youre not going to be any good to me
louis gets up and reaches out to help quinn unless you take some you time
quinn takes louis hand and gets to his feet
can we get back to the matter at hand
louis brings his sword back up into attack position
quinn is back to his swashbuckling self
the two battle it out on the field matching each other blow for blow
we creep upon ryan blood as he works at his computer
on closer inspection it appears he is editing video of quinn and louis mock fight earlier in the day
louis set up is more lavish than quinns
its obvious he indulges just a little too much
louis comes out of the bathroom with a towel around his waist
he starts singing motown songs to himself
he walks back off screen to the bedroom
we still hear him singing as we pan around the apartment
we swing back around to the entrance of louis bedroom
he finally comes out fully dressed
he uses the towel he was wearing to finish drying his hair
he walks up to a mirror and starts looking at himself
he starts to run his hands through his hair
he tries to straighten up the mess on his head
he picks up some gel and squirts a small amount in his hand
he runs it through his hair getting the desired look
to himself you are a handsome devil
louis spins around and grabs his keys off of the coffee table
he then dances right out the door
louis walks into quinns room and finds him not there
louis walks out into
ryan blood is standing in the doorway of his room across the hall
you looking for quinn
takes louis a second to register ryans question
nodding toward the exit door he just left
louis runs outside
he looks up and down the street
in the distance he finally spots them quinn and zoey holding hands
to himself what do we have here
louis stands across the street staring right into the window of the cafe
he clearly sees quinn and zoey on a date
his eyes widen as their hands touch
zoey and quinn walk holding hands through the apartment building parking lot
zoey stops for a second and turns to face quinn
why havent i seen your place
my place isnt very exciting
that doesnt surprise me
i cant imagine you having a vast blu ray collection
quinn you have to start enjoying the world around you
you know i realized today you are right about that
so youre saying you want to come up stairs and watch they call her one eye
im still trying to get i am curious yellow out of my head
sorry about that
smiles its ok
suddenly guided by instinct zoey kisses quinn on the lips
quinn is completely thrown
no dont be
i shouldnt have been that aggressive
i need to get back though
but i know
virgin and all well
that came out rude
i just mean
i wanted to do it
i should have taken it slower
ill be by tomorrow
yes of course
worried i hope so
quinn slowly turns around and walks away
zoey looks at him like she is unsure if she will see him again
meanwhile leaning against the dumpster louis watches the display unseen
ryan is working at his pc when a knock is heard
he gets up from his messy desk and makes his way over to the door
as he swings it open we see louis on the other side
ryan leans back in his desk chair
louis has cleared off a spot on a messy couch
the apartment simply put is a shithole youre here to learn more about his coming and goings
to find out what i have seen
so far you are dead on
its more than that louis you know who i am
i know pretty much everything
ive watched you studied you
i feel im expert on your little game every seventy years
ryan picks up a stack of documents and throws the papers one at a time at louis
you battled as mortals beat
you were a lamanite then beat quinn was a commander of the nephites last survivor of that nation beat the savoir spoke to him showed him his future
his destiny beat see after the death of christ there was some debate on what was going to bring on the end and signal his return beat it was decided
two great warriors had to fight
the winner would determine the start of the apocalypse
your boss of course needed someone to represent his interests
who better than quinns old adversary
louis brushes the pile of papers of his lap
where are you going with this you weird little man
you had strategy in the beginning
even world war ii
beat lets take a step back for a second
the old west
lack of faith corruption these things make quinn weak
the chink in his armor is his faith in people
you knew that and corrupting america
a young land
was the key
beat quinn was a step ahead of you and looked for a human ally
that ally was joseph smith and quinn
or i mean moroni
led joseph to the plates that later when into ryan picks a book up and throws it at louis
louis looks down at the book of mormon
his little plan didnt work but the book is a great coffee table discussion piece
this made him weak louis
you could have destroyed him
the problem is youve allowed yourself to become fond of him
you need to embrace your destiny
how do i do that
this girl is distracting him
get his mind focused on the matter at hand
at this point im afraid he isnt even going to fight you
im surprised this girl even likes quinn
he comes across creepy
maybe thats the key lightbulb make her think hes crazy
quinn opens the door to his room and spies a silhouette in the far corner
where have you been
the silhouette comes out of the darkness and into view
it should come to no surprise that louis is emerging from the darkness
youve been waiting long
no i figured you were on your way back because you are spying on me again
so i dont need to tell you where ive been
louis sits down on the edge of the bed
whos the girl
its started again
youre already jealous
you are going to do the same thing you did during the war
youre going to sabotage this
im insulted frankly
dont you play that game
you are being facetious
no im being serious
you care about the girl its obvious
not in a friendship or im curious about human behavior way
quinn sits down beside him
so why are you here
have you told her
who i am
of course not
quinn you only have a few days left and you care for this girl beat whats the harm in telling her
theres a lot of harm in telling her
if this is real and you really care for this girl you have to tell her
its only fair to her
she has a best friend who is very guarded of me
its odd she eluded to the same thing
you know the whole im hiding something and i need to come out into the open thing
sounds to me like she is right
quinn gets up and walks to the door
well i better do this now then
yeah you dont want to lose your nerve
can you let yourself out
quinn slowly opens the door and walks out
the door creeps shut behind him
louis smiles to himself feeling satisfaction
his face looks evil almost demonic
in almost a romantic movie way quinn runs toward zoeys apartment
when he reaches the door he knocks like his life depends on it
anna swings the door open shes obviously surprised to see quinn
what the hell
you can hear jack inside the apartment
what the fuck
i want to watch bring me the head of alfredo garcia in peace
i need to see zoey
what about tomorrow
or never is good
you hear zoey off screen
whats going on
zoey comes to the doorway and stands behind anna
i need to talk to you its important
quinn grabs her by the arm and pulls her outside pushing her right past anna
anna slams the door shut leaving zoey and quinn outside
i need to tell you everything
anna is so right
what are you talking about
anna is right
ive not been honest with you about what i do
or who i am
i need to come clean
i want you to trust me
i want your friends to trust me
nervous laugh ok quinn just spit it out
beat im an archangel named moroni and i basically represent light or everything thats good
louis my friend represents darkness
every seventy years we have to fight to the death
if i win everything stays the way it is
the world continues turning
if i lose louis takes on the role of the antichrist and the apocalypse will be unleashed
im talking book of revelations stuff here
so i only have a limited time left in this world
beat i want to spend that time with you
zoey is stunned silent
zoey touches his face
you must have a brain tumor or something
youre obviously mentally ill
zoey puts her finger up to his lips to quiet him
you need me more than ever
zoey reaches down and takes a confused quinns hand
she leads him to the door
like a sheep herder she takes quinn inside of the apartment
the last image we see is the apartment door slamming behind them
zoey roughly years old sits in the floor of her parents home playing
her dad only seen from the waist down walks in front of zoey with his bible in hand
he makes it to zoeys mom on the other side of the room youre not even helping me
i dont even know what you want
i cant run my congregation with this sickness
the sickness is in your head
youre too busy running around doing whatever you feel like
im going to fall apart and its all on you
zoey now is going through some boxes in the closet
her head bumps a shelf and a box falls on her
when she goes to pick up the box she finds a ton of vhs tapes
she goes through the box looking at the labels anna age anna age anna age
the glow of zoeys tv fills her face
we can neither see nor hear what she is watching
zoey looks like she is about to throw up
zoey jumps out of bed like she is waking from a nightmare
a startled quinn who was sleeping beside her starts to arouse
louis walks into quinns room with his black tote bag from earlier
its obvious he was meeting quinn to go train
he looks through out the room but quickly realizes quinn is probably with zoey
he slumps down on quinns bed
anger and hurt is portrayed upon his face
quinn and zoey are having coffee
its obvious zoey had a rough night
she takes a sip of coffee her mind is distant
based on how you are acting this morning i have my doubts
thats not what i meant though
you woke up screaming
it was nothing
i understand if you dont want to talk about it
im just concerned
its not a big deal
well wouldnt call it a nightmare
hell its not repressed
i think of it all the time
what is it
you dont want to hear about it
quinn touches her hand
zoey takes a deep breath
my father i mentioned him before was a baptist minister
he always said he had this sickness
he begged my mom for help it was more important though for her to having shopping and dinner dates with her girlfriends
anna my friend that loves you has been in my life since i was tiny
she used to come over all the time
my dad adored her
when i was around twelve i found something in the closet
my dad and anna from the time she was like seven
starts tearing up i showed my mom and dad
well he got out of prison when i was seventeen
i dont see him anymore
his church even though they knew he had a problem disowned him
he wouldnt have done that to anna if my mom would have supported him got him help
who do you think is to blame
he tried to get help quinn he reached out to my mom
i should have protected anna too
i mean none of this was your fault
i have to protect people
this was out of my control you quinn
whats going on with you
i have control of that
quinn looks at zoey
he loves her but a part of him pities her too
zoey is curled up under quinns arm as they sit on the same bench from earlier
quinn stares out toward the river
its obvious he is pondering over his choices
i love being with you
i cant renege on my responsibilities with louis though
zoey sits up
youre not actually going to fight your friend to the death are you
i know you dont understand this
we just need to make the most of our time
quinn in days things are going to be normal
this is just a delusion
i know you dont understand
i just need to go see louis today
i understand that
quinn leans his head back
he catches something out of the corner of his eye
quinn sees ryan blood hiding behind a tree
he is taking video of quinn and zoey with a smart phone
quinn jolts up
zoey is alarmed
what is it
quinn doesnt answer
he gets up and runs to the
quinn looks behind the tree but ryan is long gone
zoey comes up from behind she places her hand on quinns shoulder
what was wrong
my neighbor ryan blood
looks like hes spying on me
what are you talking about
i need to go see louis
louis is watching the video on the smart phone
hes seen enough he throws it back to ryan
louis tosses trash off the couch so he can sit down
sitting down i thought him admitting his true self would break them up
ryan plops down in his computer desk chair
instead he is still hot and heavy with her
beat he even did the bipty boom last night
the fight is pointless
its not pointless
the game has just changed is all
beat we have two levels here one is making sure we keep him engaged
beat honestly though thats an afterthought at this point so whats the next move
ryan reaches into his desk drawer
still searching well when he does become engaged
ryan throws something at louis
louis catches the item
he looks down to see a nine millimeter
we need to make sure you still have the advantage
zoey is pacing back and forth
jack rubs his face in frustration
he is tired of watching zoey tear herself up over this guy
anna tries to step into zoeys path attempting to get her attention what are you doing
zoey is jittery she cant handle anna blocking her way
i havent heard from quinn since he wigged out today
well honestly maybe thats a good thing
he needs me
he doesnt need you
not everyone needs you
frustrated this isnt about me and you this is about me and you
you think you can make up for what happened
the fact you didnt notice couldnt save me in time
you were a child
i was a child
you couldnt have saved your father either
your mother couldnt have no one could have
he was a fucking pedophile
zoey slaps anna across the face
hate me all you want but its impossible to redeem yourself for things you had no control over
jack is sick and tired of this display
just show her the fucking file
jack gets up
confused what fucking file
quinn runs toward louis apartment
his knocks sound like a jackhammer on the door
we have a problem
louis moves slightly and we see ryan blood in the background
louis slowly closes the door in a stunned quinns face
louis turns toward ryan
i thought coming here would give us some privacy from quinn
i think it worked out perfectly
jack walks into the room holding a file folder
zoey is sitting on the couch trying to get a grip
jack throws the file in her lap
so is the file folder for dramatic effect
no it was to keep everything organized
beat and for dramatic effect
suddenly zoeys cell phon rings
she sets the folder aside and answers
quinn is on a pay phone hes shaking
at this point he is lost on what his next move should be
you mentioned that earlier
what is going on
hes with louis
theyre planning to kill me
i thought that was the whole plan
this isnt like louis
i think he is trying to cheat his way to a win
why dont you come over here
come on quinn get a grip
just calm down and come over here
ok so just come on over and well talk
no i mean youre right
i need to get control of myself
i have a destiny
i need to figure out my next move
no wait quinn hangs up the phone
zoey slowly drops her cell phone to the floor
jack picks up the folder zoey set aside
what is it
i dont know
hes losing it
jack hands her the folder
you need to look at this
zoey takes the folder from him and starts reading
i spent a lot of time gathering that information
so what is all this
quinn wilson and louis marks were orphans
zoey is flipping through documents
quinn displayed some erratic behavior from the beginning
one of the staff members was mormon and they would read stories to quinn out of the book of mormon
that employee was later fired but a seed was planted in quinns head
he kept going on about how he and louis were meant to fight to the death
some of the children at the time claim louis would encourage this behavior
he probably thought this was quinns attempt at playing
beat as things continued the staff at the orphanage thought quinn needed help beyond what they could offer
they sent quinn to a hospital
zoey puts the folder down the documents fall to the floor
youre not telling me anything i didnt already know
that makes it worse
youre going to continue this now that you know for a fact that he is nuts
im too far into this now
i dont have a choice
zoey picks the documents up and places them in the folder
she then tosses the folder on the coffee table
why dont you let us save you
let me be guys
zoey walks to her bedroom leaving anna and jack exhausted
the apartment is quiet
anna no where in sight more than likely in her room sleeping
jack is passed out on the couch
zoey walks in its obvious she hasnt slept all night
she scoots jacks legs over and sits on the couch
she proceeds to pick up the file folder
she starts thumbing through the documents
after a few moments she finds one of interest
she reaches over and pushes jack
rousing up ehhh
you better be a hot bear of a man
jack looks up and sees zoey
what do you need hun
zoey hands jack a document from the folder
jacks eyes try to focus on the document
looks like a room list from the psych hospital
i gathered that
under quinns room
quinn and his roommate is listed
quinns roommate was ryan blood
looks that way
louis stares out into the open field
a gust of wind blows through his hair
ryan blood comes up from behind and pats louis on the back
we need to talk
louis turns around to face ryan
i have a method i have to hear this
a point system confused like steps
its a sure fire plan to throw quinn off of his game louis laughs
oh i am so all ears
well the first thing you need is a battle cry
a battle cry
yes a battle cry
every great warrior has one
and a battle cry is going to give me the advantage in battle
of course it will
why dont you try one out
yeah try one out right now
id rather not
extremely confused right here
here ill go first ryan lets out a scream that sounds as though he is being sodomized
beat your turn
louis looks around
so right now
louis inhales deeply and then lets out a scream
it comes out more like frightened little girl
oh come on
that sounds like you are scared of the battle
are you scared of quinn
you probably are louis lets out another scream this one is slightly better
louis lets out another one that actually causes ryan to jump back
yes thats what im talking about
out of nowhere quinn walks up to the two of them
noticing quinn quinn
good to see you
quinn grabs louis arm
we need to talk
to ryan excuse me for a second
louis walks with quinn to a spot that gives them some distance away from ryan
i know that guy and i dont trust him
i dont trust you anymore
your new friend is dangerous
so is yours
leave her out of this
you fighting tomorrow morning quinn
this whole thing is nuts
im walking away
let me walk away from you first then
louis starts to walk away from quinn
he turns around as he continues to walk backwards
im coming at you
you are in this game like it or not
zoeys car pulls up in front of an historic brick building
she slowly gets out and starts to look the structure over
its almost like she is trying to assess if she has the right place
a awkward young man jake is sorting through boxes
hes kneeled on the floor organizing a mess of files
zoey walks up and tries to attract his attention
jake comes out of his world of file sorting
he looks up at zoey
im looking for mrs
i believe the people here referred to her as mother
monotone people look for a lot of things
zoey is confused
im sure they do
looking at the boxes you guys shutting down
monotone we are ceasing operations
is there something wrong with you
rhodes a year old odd looking lady comes out of the back
you need to calm down and count to ten
i dont know what that means
rhodes starts waving her hands at zoey
she flaps them up and down in her face
you have to calm down and meditate
listen do you know quinn wilson and louis marks
they grew up here
rhodes steps back like a vampire who has just seen a cross
you need to leave
and give me your shirt
zoey turns around and starts to leave
rhodes starts screaming at the top of her lungs
you better make your peace with god girl
the end is coming those boys are ushering in a new era
zoey runs down the hallway toward the front door
zoey runs outside and makes it to her car
she hits the roof of her vehicle in anger what a fucking nut house
monotone excuse me
zoey jumps up and screams
she sees jake standing creepily behind her
monotone i know the young boys you speak of
doesnt care and
monotone i was here when quinn got sent to the mental hospital
it was like the other one set it up
you think louis made quinn appear crazy
monotone they both believed the same thing
louis was just smart enough to hide it
there is more to it than that
monotone i dont understand listen robot boy where did this whole belief come from
this isnt something two kids come up with on their own
monotone yes i believe a seed was planted
i heard there was an employee that got fired for sharing mormon mythology with the boys
hes not the right one
jack sits at the pc while chatting away on his cell phone
it appears he is looking up information for who ever is on the other end
zoey is parked in a parking lot while she chats on her cell phone with jack
you might be right sweetheart
the employee i was telling you about earlier was instrumental in getting appleridge orphanage shut down
rhodes was pretty well known in huntington
i think she felt this guy was getting in the way of her master plan
finally nearly years later he convinced the state what was really going on there
that girl you talked to was pants crapping nuts
she actually makes your boyfriend look sane
i guess she believes that lucifer came to her in a vision how is that different than a dream
just saying i dont know
i think you have to be awake for a vision
beat will you please pay attention
anyway he meaning lucifer gave her this jazz about
well you know the story
two angels fighting to the death
anyway he told her she needed to look after louis and get quinn out of there
i guess trying to stack the odds in louis favor
so she had quinn committed
to the same hospital where her nephew was a patient
all on the dark lords orders i guess
fucking ryan blood
your friends are fucking whack
so what are you going to do
im going to stop an apocalyptic battle
jack realizes zoey hung up on him
he slowly puts his phone down and steps away from the computer
he walks over to the couch and sits down
he lets out a sigh of exhaustion as he leans back on the couch
jack is now sprawled out on the couch
anna walks in the room and sets a beverage on the coffee table in front of him
she moves his legs and sits down beside of him
so where is she at now
jack sits up
i got a text about thirty minutes ago
im pretty sure she is going to head to quinns apartment
her christ complex is going to get her killed
trust me i know anna
beat i know
knocking is heard at the door
anna gets up to answer
maybe its quinn the jackass
anna just gets the door opened a crack when
ryan and louis burst into the room
louis restrains her against a wall
jack gets up from the couch but he meets a gun handle to the head from ryan
good afternoon boys and girls
i need your assistance
quinn walks into his room
to his surprise zoey is sitting on his bed
it appears she has been there for a while
how do people keep ending up in my room
laughs you need to learn to lock up
quinn walks over and sits on the bed beside her
im not fighting louis
why the change of heart
i think you might be right
i dont think its necessary
i think the world will keep turning one way or another
im not dependant on that
beat im not a savior
do you really believe
i do believe it
i know it actually
since i have been with you ive doubted what i know to be fact though
then it hit me it really doesnt matter
ill help you quinn
i dont want to do it for myself
i dont want to do it because i feel i have to
obligations or dark incidents from my past
thats not a reason to help anyone
it makes me fucking selfish actually
youre not selfish zoey
i care about you quinn
thats sincerely my reason for wanting to do this
thats a first for me you know
quinn hugs her and they slowly lay down on the bed together
quinn gets pistol whipped across the face
suddenly we see louis picking zoey up by the hair
in pain let her go
louis has a hold of zoey
quinn gets up and goes for ryan
louis drop kicks quinn and sends him flying across the room
louis throws zoey at ryan
ryan then holds her at gun point
looking at quinn let me pretty the girl up a bit ryan beats her repeatedly with the gun until she passes out cold from the trauma
quinn tries to get to his feet but louis kicks him back down
hold on sunshine
ryan throws louis the gun
we see louis with great force repeatedly hit quinn with the gun
everything goes fuzzy and then we
quinn slowly gets to his feet
he walks over to the doorway and kneels down
he sees a puddle of blood
he puts his fingers in it
he inspects his hand rubbing the blood between his index finger and thumb
he jumps up and screams in anger
that would be quinns version of a battle cry
a hand rips duct tape off of jacks mouth
he lets out a loud scream
quinn crouches down beside jack
jack and anna are both tied up anna still has duct tape across her mouth
you can hear her muffled screams as they fill the room
fuck you mother fucker
im going to call the fucking fuzz once you untie me
fucking nut bag ball sac like he is talking to a retarded child i
ass fuck salad quinn puts the duct tape back on jacks mouth
even though we cant make out what he is saying he is still running off at the mouth
that actually felt kind of good
quinn pats jack on the head
ill be back guys
quinn leaves the room
muffled cursing can be heard through out the apartment
a long black box is pulled out from under quinns bed
we see quinns hands unlatch and then open it
inside we see quinns katana
his hand grips the hilt
quinn gets up holding his katana and ready for a fight
hes dressed in a black biker jacket kind of looking like the bride from kill bill
he walks to the doorway
he stands still for a second
hes preparing his next move
bad ass comic book pose
the front doors to the church swing open
light fills the sanctuary
zoey walks through the doors
she heads toward the alter and sees a man in his s kneeling
it appears he might be praying
she places her hand on his shoulder
as he turns around she sees her dad
im not doing it anymore
you will not have redemption from me
he reaches for her she pulls away
she starts to back up
take ownership of what you did
dont rely on me to save you
i need to start saving myself
she slowly backs up and then turns to walk away
as she is turning goodbye
ryan slaps zoey in the face to wake her up
ryan pulls zoey up to her feet
he presses the gun against her head
louis walks out into the middle of the field
hes dressed in a full ninja outfit
he unsheathes his katana
what do you think zoey
im a ninja
struggling under ryans grip youre fucking crazy
thats not nice
i think i look good
i think youre a fucking nut bag
this is going to be fun
does that name ring a bell
she played a part in the game
tell us something we dont know
youre such a sexy nancy drew right now
go fuck yourself
or a foul mouthed velma
that gets me so hard
does that get you hard ryan
can we go back to my aunt please
what about her
other than she fucked you guys up
she taught you louis how to play it straight
then she has you fuck quinn over
she didnt fuck quinn over
she just helped him out
yeah by getting him in contact with you
she knew one day it was all going to catch up with her
she trained me to get into the game
she told me it was my destiny
is that why she placed you in that hospital
she was my caretaker
she told me she was sending me someone
someone i would have to guide on to the right path
guys i have let my parents fuck me up
there comes a time though where you have to go out on your own
take responsibility for your own life
there is a much bigger purpose
this whole thing was to carry out some delusional womans master plan
she doesnt even remember who she is at this point
i went to see her
she wanted me to take off my shirt
louis is irritated
will you shut up
you are ruining my climatic fight
louis spies quinn in the distance
quinn lowers his katana it brushes against the blades of grass
louis follows suit as he slowly walks to meet quinn in the middle
the two warriors stand on opposite sides of the battle field
quinn looks over and sees zoey
let her go
ryan grabs her tighter
to louis is this the game you want to play
im not going to lose this time
to quinn i thought you didnt believe this shit anymore
theres more going on than you realize zoey
this is fucked
quinn youre not years old
you were born in an orphanage
none of this makes sense
lady it would look weird if we roamed the earth for years without facing a mortal death
we keep getting reborn sometimes we even switch physical form
thanks for coming to the game late missy
that makes total fucking sense
color me stupid
to louis you dont get it do you
if you win
youre not becoming the antichrist
what are you talking about
its always been ryan
to ryan what is he talking about
hes pitting us against each other
im going to be honest with you louis
ive always been honest
yeah sometimes to a fault
we have always played this game as honest as we could
we never did anything to undermine the other
despite what you represent you have moral code
beat you are not acting with in that code today
im tired of losing
youre losing right now
your actions you cant win like this
not acting this way
im tired of you
im going to end it
louis goes over to ryan
he trades his sword in for ryans gun
ryan holds the katana to zoeys throat
louis points the gun dead at quinn
you going to shoot me
its the endgame
tense moment as louis aims the gun at quinn
suddenly he spins and shoots ryan dead in the head
ryan falls and zoey gets free
louis looks at quinn and then throws the gun far out into the field
i guess i do have some morals
zoey gets her bearings
what the fuck
zoey go home
we need to finish this
louis walks over to ryan and grabs his katana
no you dont
guys what are you doing
go home girl
are you being serious
quinn stops and turns toward zoey
i will always love you
you have to go though
if you dont walk away from this field right now you will lose me
i will not be in your corner
i will call for help
they will stop you
zoey walks over to ryans body
she searches till she finds her cell phone in his front pocket
i will call the police quinn
quinn looks at zoey dead in the eyes
quinn turns toward louis
he pulls his katana up to attack position and louis follows suit
tearing up wow
quinn and louis charge each other
zoey doesnt bother to stay to watch the battle
she slowly walks away
quinn and louis swords meet
the clang is triumphant
details of this climatic battle will be choreographed by the actors involved but think high flying shaw brothers film
we dont see a clear victor just the two boys going at it until we cant tell who is who
zoey starts to make a call on her cell phone
she starts to dial
her thumb moves in the position to hit send
she slowly puts her phone away
she looks back toward where the battle is going on
she starts to walk back
the walk turns into a jog
finally the jog turns into a full run
when she gets to the field quinn and louis are gone
all that can be seen is ryan bloods body two katanas and an empty ninja suit
zoey leans down and touches quinns katana
laughs to herself i am curious yellow beat goodbye boys
zoey stares out into the open field
she feels reborn
she knows there is a new world a new perspective for her beyond the horizon
the camera slowly pans toward an older ninety year old zoey
shes behind a podium there is a sign on the front that reads marshal university association of free thought
for years we have thought absence of the impossible indicated that we were exercising free thought
in my experience ladies and gentleman thats not the case
beat believing in hope my friends opening yourself up to accepting there might be more than the world around you
thats truly being a free thinker
the camera ends with a close shot on zoeys face
zoey sits on the same bench where she met quinn
her great granddaughter jennifer walks up
she sits down beside her grandmother
you look solemn
just sitting here
what are you thinking about
ive had a great life
a wonderful husband children grandchildren
motions to jennifer great grandchildren
i spent so much of my youth being angry
i wish i could relive my life now knowing what i know
you do have a lot of wisdom
ive tried to pass it on to you
youve taught me a lot
just remember you can believe what you want to believe jennifer
live by what ever moral code you want to live by
just make sure its yours
dont let it stem from anger or past tragedies
beat let it come from your heart
jennifer turns around
what is it
my new boyfriend
the one i wanted you to meet
zoey turns around to see the boyfriend walking toward them
it shouldnt come to a surprise that he looks a lot like quinn
jennifer gets up and grabs her boyfriend around the waist
he reaches his hand out to zoey
nervous nice to meet to maam
shakes his hand likewise
jennifer grabs his hand right after his handshake with zoey
we better get going
were going to grab something to eat
to the boyfriend i didnt catch your name
im so sorry
im being rude
laughs he can be like that
zoey is stunned
to zoey you ok
yeah im fine
snapping out of it enjoy dinner
see you later on
making eye contact with zoey smiling nice to meet you
returning contact and smiles likewise
the two lovebirds walk away
zoey stares at them for a second
a it cant be look crosses her face
zoey smiles almost to say to the camera that there is more out there
things that we dont fully understand
the smile then fades
her final look is that of content
and then as done and dusted plays we
