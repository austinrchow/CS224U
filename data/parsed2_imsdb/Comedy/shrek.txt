written by william steig ted elliott once upon a time there was a lovely princess
but she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by loves first kiss
she was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire breathing dragon
many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison but non prevailed
she waited in the dragons keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true loves first kiss
laughs like thats ever gonna happen
what a load of toilet flush allstar by smashmouth begins to play
shrek goes about his day
while in a nearby town the villagers get together to go after the ogre
think its in there
lets get it
do you know what that thing can do to you
yeah itll grind your bones for its bread
shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs
yes well actually that would be a giant
now ogres oh theyre much worse
theyll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin
theyll shave your liver
squeeze the jelly from your eyes
actually its quite good on toast
i warn ya
waves the torch at shrek
shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch
the men shrink back away from him
shrek roars very loudly and long and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the men are in the dark
this is the part where you run away
the men scramble to get away
and stay out
looks down and picks up a piece of paper
fairy tale creatures
he sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder
there is a line of fairy tale creatures
the head of the guard sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures to him
there are cages all around
some of the people in line are peter pan who is carrying tinkerbell in a cage gipetto whos carrying pinocchio and a farmer who is carrying the three little pigs
this ones full
take it away
move it along
taking the witchs broom give me that
your flying days are over
breaks the broom in half thats pieces of silver for the witch
crying this cage is too small
please dont turn me in
ill never be stubborn again
i can change
give me another chance
oh shut up
jerks his rope oh
what have you got
this little wooden puppet
im not a puppet
im a real boy
his nose grows five shillings for the possessed toy
take it away
dont let them do this
gipetto takes the money and walks off
the old woman steps up to the table
what have you got
well ive got a talking donkey
well thats good for ten shillings if you can prove it
oh go ahead little fella
donkey just looks up at her
oh oh hes just
hes just a little nervous
hes really quite a chatterbox
talk you boneheaded dolt
ive heard enough
no no he talks
pretends to be donkey i can talk
i love to talk
im the talkingest damn thing you ever saw
get her out of my sight
he can talk
the guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them
one of her legs flies out and kicks tinkerbell out of peter pans hands and her cage drops on donkeys head
he gets sprinkled with fairy dust and hes able to fly
i can fly
he can fly
he can fly
he can talk
thats right fool
now im a flying talking donkey
you might have seen a housefly maybe even a superfly but i bet you aint never seen a donkey fly
the pixie dust begins to wear off uh oh
he begins to sink to the ground
he hits the ground with a thud
donkey takes of running
hes getting away
donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into shrek
shrek turns around to see who bumped into him
donkey looks scared for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path
he quickly hides behind shrek
by the order of lord farquaad i am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility
you and what army
he looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well and we see that the other men have run off
the guard tucks tail and runs off
shrek laughs and goes back about his business and begins walking back to his cottage
can i say something to you
listen you was really really really somethin back here
are you talkin to
he turns around and donkey is gone me
he turns back around and donkey is right in front of him
i was talkin to you
can i tell you that you that you was great back here
they thought they was all of that
then you showed up and bam
they was trippin over themselves like babes in the woods
that really made me feel good to see that
oh thats great
man its good to be free
now why dont you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends
but uh i dont have any friends
and im not goin out there by myself
hey wait a minute
i got a great idea
ill stick with you
youre mean green fightin machine
together well scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us
shrek turns and regards donkey for a moment before roaring very loudly
that was really scary
if you dont mind me sayin if that dont work your breath certainly will get the job done cause you definitely need some tic tacs or something cause you breath
you almost burned the hair outta my nose just like the time
shrek covers his mouth but donkey continues to talk so shrek removes his hand
then i ate some rotten berries
i had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day
why are you following me
ill tell you why
singing cause im all alone theres no one here beside me my problems have all gone theres no one to deride me but you gotta have faith
its no wonder you dont have any friends
only a true friend would be that cruelly honest
listen little donkey
take a look at me

whod want to live in place like that
that would be my home
and it is lovely
you know you are quite a decorator
its amazing what youve done with such a modest budget
i like that boulder
that is a nice boulder
i guess you dont entertain much do you
i like my privacy

thats another thing we have in common
like i hate it when you got somebody in your face
youve trying to give them a hint and they wont leave
theres that awkward silence
awkward silence can i stay with you
can i stay with you please
sarcastically of course
i dont wanna go back there
you dont know what its like to be considered a freak
pause while he looks at shrek well maybe you do
but thats why we gotta stick together
you gotta let me stay
but one night only
he runs inside the cottage what are you
donkey hops up onto a chair
this is gonna be fun
we can stay up late swappin manly stories and in the mornin im makin waffles
where do uh i sleep
oh well i guess thats cool
i mean i dont know you and you dont know me so i guess outside is best you know

shrek slams the door
sigh i mean i do like the outdoors
im a donkey
i was born outside
ill just be sitting by myself outside i guess you know
by myself outside
im all alone
theres no one here beside me
shrek is getting ready for dinner
he sits himself down and lights a candle made out of earwax
he begins to eat when he hears a noise
he stands up with a huff
to donkey i thought i told you to stay outside
from the window i am outside
there is another noise and shrek turns to find the person that made the noise
he sees several shadows moving
he finally turns and spots blind mice on his table
well gents its a far cry from the farm but what choice do we have
its not home but itll do just fine
bouncing on a slug what a lovely bed
grabs a mouse but it escapes and lands on his shoulder
i found some cheese
bites shreks ear ow
is that you gordo
how did you know
he grabs the mice what are you doing in my house
he gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice
he turns and sees the seven dwarves with snow white on the table
oh no no no
dead broad off the table
where are we supposed to put her
the beds taken
shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain
the big bad wolf is sitting in the bed
the wolf just looks at him
shrek now has the big bad wolf by the collar and is dragging him to the front door
i live in a swamp
i put up signs
im a terrifying ogre
what do i have to do get a little privacy
he opens the front door to throw the wolf out and he sees that all the collected fairy tale creatures are on his land
the bears sit around the fire the pied piper is playing his pipe and the rats are all running to him some elves are directing flight traffic so that the
fairies and witches can land
what are you doing in my swamp
this echoes and everyone falls silent
gasps are heard all around
the good fairies hide inside a tent
all right get out of here
all of you move it
more dwarves run inside the house no no
they shut the door on him oh
turns to look at donkey hey dont look at me
i didnt invite them
oh gosh no one invited us
we were forced to come here
flabbergasted by who
he huffed and he puffed and he
signed an eviction notice
heavy sigh all right
who knows where this farquaad guy is
everyone looks around at each other but no one answers
oh i do
i know where he is
does anyone else know where to find him
anyone at all
oh pick me
oh i know
sigh okay fine
attention all fairy tale things
do not get comfortable
your welcome is officially worn out
in fact im gonna see this guy farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from
then the crowd goes wild
to donkey you

all right thats what i like to hear man
shrek and donkey two stalwart friends off on a whirlwind big city adventure
i love it
singing on the road again
sing it with me shrek
i cant wait to get on the road again
what did i say about singing

can i hum it
all right hum it
donkey begins to hum on the road again
a masked man is torturing the gingerbread man
hes continually dunking him in a glass of milk
lord farquaad walks in
hes ready to talk
the gingerbread man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down onto a cookie sheet
farquaad laughs as he walks over to the table
however when he reaches the table we see that it goes up to his eyes
he clears his throat and the table is lowered
he picks up the gingerbread mans legs and plays with them run run run as fast as you can
you cant catch me
im the gingerbread man
you are a monster
im not the monster here
you and the rest of that fairy tale trash poisoning my perfect world
now tell me
where are the others
he spits milk into farquaads eye
ive tried to be fair to you creatures

the door opens and the head guard walks in
we found it
then what are you waiting for
bring it in
more guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet
they hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet
it is the magic mirror
in awe ohhhh
dont tell him anything
farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid
mirror mirror on the wall
is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all
well technically youre not a king
thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist
you were saying
what i mean is youre not a king yet
but you can become one
all you have to do is marry a princess
chuckles nervously so just sit back and relax my lord because its time for you to meet todays eligible bachelorettes

the castle itself is about stories high
but thats it
thats it right there
i told ya id find it
so that must be lord farquaads castle
thats the place
do you think maybe hes compensating for something
he laughs but then groans as donkey doesnt get the joke
he continues walking through the parking lot
wait up shrek
the attendant who is wearing a giant head that looks like lord farquaad screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get
away from shrek
wait a second
look im not gonna eat you
i just i just he sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows
the attendant runs into a wall and falls down
shrek and donkey look at him then continue on into duloc
they look around but all is quiet
where is everybody
hey look at this
donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box marked information
the music winds up and then the box doors open up
there are little wooden people inside and they begin to sing
welcome to duloc such a perfect town here we have some rules let us lay them down dont make waves stay in line and well get along fine duloc is
perfect place please keep off of the grass shine your shoes wipe your
face duloc is duloc is duloc is perfect place
suddenly a camera takes donkey and shreks picture
lets do that again
makes ready to run over and pull the lever again grabs donkeys tail and holds him still no
no no no
they hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena
you are the best and brightest in all the land
today one of you shall prove himself
as shrek and donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena donkey is humming the duloc theme song
youre going the right way for a smacked bottom
sorry about that
that champion shall have the honor no no the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely princess fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon
if for any reason the winner is unsuccessful the first runner up will take his place and so on and so forth
some of you may die but its a sacrifice i am willing to make
cheers let the tournament begin
he notices shrek oh
what is that
turns to look at donkey and then back at farquaad ah thats not very nice
its just a donkey
knights new plan
the one who kills the ogre will be named champion
have it him
now come on
hang on now
bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer go ahead
holds up a mug of beer cant we just settle this over a pint
kill the beast
all right then
drinks the beer come on
he takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel of beer behind him
the beer comes rushing out drenching the other men and wetting the ground
its like mud now
shrek slides past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped
as shrek begins to fight donkey hops up onto one of the larger beer barrels
it breaks free of its ropes and begins to roll
donkey manages to squish two men into the mud
there is so much fighting going on here im not going to go into detail
suffice to say that shrek kicks butt
hey shrek tag me
shrek comes over and bangs a mans head up against donkeys
shrek gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd
a man tries to sneak up behind shrek but shrek turns in time and sees him
give him the chair
shrek smashes a chair over the guys back
finally all the men are down
donkey kicks one of them in the helmet and the ding sounds the end of the match
the audience goes wild
thank you very much
im here till thursday
try the veal
laughs the laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on shrek
shall i give the order sir
no i have a better idea
people of duloc i give you our champion
youre won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest
im already in a quest a quest to get my swamp back
yeah my swamp
where you dumped those fairy tale creatures
all right ogre
ill make you a deal
go on this quest for me and ill give you your swamp back
exactly the way it was
down to the last slime covered toadstool
and the squatters
as good as gone
what kind of quest
time lapse donkey and shrek are now walking through the field heading away from duloc
shrek is munching on an onion
let me get this straight
youre gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only dont have because he filled it full of
freaks in the first place
is that about right
you know maybe theres a good reason donkeys shouldnt talk
i dont get it
why dont you just pull some of that ogre stuff on him
throttle him lay siege to his fortress grinds his bones to make your bread the whole ogre trip
oh i know what
maybe i could have decapitated an entire village and put their heads on a pike gotten a knife cut open their spleen and drink their fluids
does that sound good to you
uh no not really no
for your information theres a lot more to ogres than people think
okay um ogres are like onions
he holds out his onion sniffs the onion they stink
they make you cry
you leave them in the sun they get all brown start sproutin little white hairs
onions have layers
ogres have layers
onions have layers
you get it
we both have layers
he heaves a sigh and then walks off trailing after shrek oh you both have layers
sniffs you know not everybody likes onions
everybody loves cakes
cakes have layers
i dont care
what everyone likes
ogres are not like cakes
you know what else everybody likes
have you ever met a person you say lets get some parfait they say hell no i dont like no parfait
parfaits are delicious
you dense irritating miniature beast of burden
ogres are like onions
and of story
see ya later
parfaits may be the most delicious thing on the whole damn planet
you know i think i preferred your humming
do you have a tissue or something
im making a mess
just the word parfait make me start slobbering
they head off
there is a montage of their journey
walking through a field at sunset
sleeping beneath a bright moon
shrek trying to put the campfire out the next day and having a bit of a problem so donkey pees on the fire to put it out
shrek and donkey are walking up to the keep thats supposed to house princess fiona
it appears to look like a giant volcano
did you do that
you gotta warn somebody before you just crack one off
my mouth was open and everything
believe me donkey if it was me youd be dead
sniffs its brimstone
we must be getting close
yeah right brimstone
dont be talking about its the brimstone
i know what i smell
it wasnt no brimstone
it didnt come off no stone neither
they climb up the side of the volcano keep and look down
there is a small piece of rock right in the center and that is where the castle is
it is surrounded by boiling lava
it looks very foreboding
sure its big enough but look at the location
then the laugh turns into a groan uh shrek
uh remember when you said ogres have layers
well i have a bit of a confession to make
donkeys dont have layers
we wear our fear right out there on our sleeves
wait a second
donkeys dont have sleeves
you know what i mean
you cant tell me youre afraid of heights
no im just a little uncomfortable about being on a rickety bridge over a boiling like of lava
come on donkey
im right here beside ya okay
for emotional support
well just tackle this thing together one little baby step at a time
okay that makes me feel so much better
just keep moving
and dont look down
okay dont look down
dont look down
dont look down
keep on moving
dont look down
he steps through a rotting board and ends up looking straight down into the lava shrek
im lookin down
oh god i cant do this
just let me off please
but youre already halfway
but i know that half is safe
i dont have time for this
you go back
just donkey lets have a dance then shall me
bounces and sways the bridge dont do that
oh im sorry
bounces the bridge again yes that
yes do it
continues to bounce and sway as he backs donkey across the bridge no shrek
you said do it
im doin it
im gonna die
im gonna die
shrek im gonna die
steps onto solid ground oh
thatll do donkey
walks towards the castle cool
so where is this fire breathing pain in the neck anyway
inside waiting for us to rescue her
chuckles i was talkin about the dragon shrek
sees a skeleton and gasps cause theres nothin wrong with bein afraid
fears a sensible response to an unfamiliar situation
unfamiliar dangerous situation i might add
with a dragon that breathes fire and eats knights and breathes fire it sure doesnt mean youre a coward if youre a little scared
i sure as heck aint no coward
i know that
donkey two things okay
now go over there and see if you can find any stairs
i thought we was lookin for the princess
putting on a helmet the princess will be up the stairs in the highest room in the tallest tower
what makes you think shell be there
i read it in a book once
walks off cool
you handle the dragon
ill handle the stairs
ill find those stairs
ill whip their butt too
those stairs wont know which way theyre goin
walks off donkey is still talking to himself as he looks around the room
im gonna take drastic steps
kick it to the curb
dont mess with me
im the stair master
ive mastered the stairs
i wish i had a step right here
id step all over it
shrek spots a light in the tallest tower window
well at least we know where the princess is but wheres the
donkey gasps and takes off running as the dragon roars again
shrek manages to grab donkey out of the way just as the dragon breathes fire
donkey look out
he manages to get a hold of the dragons tail and holds on got ya
the dragon gets irritated at this and flicks its tail and shrek goes flying through the air and crashes through the roof of the tallest tower
fiona wakes up with a jerk and looks at him lying on the floor
donkey get cornered as the dragon knocks away all but a small part of the bridge hes on
oh no no
the dragon roars oh what large teeth you have
the dragon growls i mean white sparkling teeth
i know you probably hear this all time from your food but you must bleach cause that is one dazzling smile you got there
do i detect a hint of minty freshness
and you know what else
youre youre a girl dragon
i mean of course youre a girl dragon
youre just reeking of feminine beauty
the dragon begins fluttering her eyes at him whats the matter with you
you got something in your eye
man id really love to stay but you know im uh
the dragon blows a smoke ring in the shape of a heart right at him and he coughs im an asthmatic and i dont know if itd work out if
youre gonna blow smoke rings
the dragon picks him up with her teeth and carries him off no
shrek groans as he gets up off the floor
his back is to fiona so she straightens her dress and lays back down on the bed
she then quickly reaches over and gets the bouquet of flowers off the side table
she then lays back down and appears to be asleep
shrek turns and goes over to her
he looks down at fiona for a moment and she puckers her lips
shrek takes her by the shoulders and shakes her away
are you princess fiona
i am awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue me
oh thats nice
now lets go
but wait sir knight
this be ith our first meeting
should it not be a wonderful romantic moment
yeah sorry lady
theres no time
what are you doing
you should sweep me off my feet out yonder window and down a rope onto your valiant steed
youve had a lot of time to plan this havent you
smiles mm hmm
shrek breaks the lock on her door and pulls her out and down the hallway
but we have to savor this moment
you could recite an epic poem for me
i dont think so
can i at least know the name of my champion
clears throat and holds out a handkerchief i pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude
suddenly they hear the dragon roar
surprised you didnt slay the dragon
its on my to do list
now come on
takes off running and drags fiona behind him
but this isnt right
you were meant to charge in sword drawn banner flying
thats what all the other knights did
yeah right before they burst into flame
thats not the point
shrek suddenly stops and she runs into him
shrek ignores her and heads for a wooden door off to the side
where are you going
the exits over there
well i have to save my ass
what kind of knight are you
one of a kind
opens the door into the throne room os slow down
slow down baby please
i believe its healthy to get to know someone over a long period of time
just call me old fashioned
laughs worriedly we see him up close and from a distance as shrek sneaks into the room i dont want to rush into a physical relationship
im not emotionally ready for a commitment of uh this magnitude really is the word im looking for
magnitude hey that is unwanted physical contact
hey what are you doing
lets just back up a little and take this one step at a time
we really should get to know each other first as friends or pen pals
im on the road a lot but i just love receiving cards id really love to stay but dont do that
thats my tail
thats my personal tail
youre gonna tear it off
i dont give permission what are you gonna do with that
no no no
shrek grabs a chain thats connected to the chandelier and swings toward the dragon
he misses and he swings back again
he looks up and spots that the chandelier is right above the dragons head
he pulls on the chain and it releases and he falls down and bumps donkey out of the way right as the dragon is about to kiss him
instead the dragon kisses shreks butt
she opens her eyes and roars
shrek lets go of the chain and the chandelier falls onto her head but its too big and it goes over her head and forms a sort of collar for
she roars again and shrek and donkey take off running
very matrix style
shrek grabs donkey and then grabs princess fiona as he runs past her
yeah its getting him to shut up thats the trick
they all start screaming as the dragon gains on them
shrek spots a descending slide and jumps on
but unfortunately there is a crack in the stone and it hits shrek right in the groin
his eyes cross and as he reaches the bottom of the slide he stumbles off and walks lightly
shrek gets them close to the exit and sets down donkey and fiona
okay you two heard for the exit
ill take care of the dragon
shrek grabs a sword and heads back toward the interior of the castle
he throws the sword down in between several overlapping chain links
the chain links are attached to the chandelier that is still around the dragons neck
they all take off running for the exit with the dragon in hot pursuit
they make it to the bridge and head across
the dragons breathes fire and the bridge begins to burn
they all hang on for dear life as the ropes holding the bridge up collapse
they are swung to the other side
as they hang upside down they look in horror as the dragon makes to fly over the boiling lava to get them
but suddenly the chandelier with the chain jerk the dragon back and shes unable to get to them
our gang climbs quickly to safety as the dragon looks angry and then gives a sad whimper as she watches donkey walk away
sliding down the volcano hill you did it
you rescued me
behind her donkey falls down the hill youre youre wonderful
turns and sees shrek fall down the hill and bump into donkey a little unorthodox ill admit
but thy deed is great and thy heart is pure
i am eternally in your debt
donkey clears his throat
and where would a brave knight be without his noble steed
i hope you heard that
she called me a noble steed
she think im a steed
the battle is won
you may remove your helmet good sir knight
i have helmet hair
i wouldst look upon the face of my rescuer
no no you wouldnt st
but how will you kiss me
to donkey that wasnt in the job description
maybe its a perk
no its destiny
oh you must know how it goes
a princess locked in a tower and beset by a dragon is rescued by a brave knight and then they share true loves first kiss
you think wait
you think that shrek is you true love
both donkey and shrek burst out laughing
you think shrek is your true love
what is so funny
lets just say im not your type okay
fiona of course you are
youre my rescuer
now now remove your helmet
i really dont think this is a good idea
just take off the helmet
im not going to
take it off
as you command
takes off his helmet you youre a an ogre
oh you were expecting prince charming
well yes actually
this is all wrong
youre not supposed to be an ogre
princess i was sent to rescue you by lord farquaad okay
he is the one who wants to marry you
then why didnt he come rescue me
you should ask him that when we get there
but i have to be rescued by my true love not by some ogre and his his pet
well so much for noble steed
youre not making my job any easier
im sorry but your job is not my problem
you can tell lord farquaad that if he wants to rescue me properly ill be waiting for him right here
im no ones messenger boy all right
ominous im a delivery boy
he swiftly picks her up and swings her over his shoulder like she was a sack of potatoes you wouldnt dare
put me down
ya comin donkey
im right behind ya
put me down or you will suffer the consequences
this is not dignified
put me down
a little time has passed and fiona has calmed down
she just hangs there limply while shrek carries her
okay so heres another question
say theres a woman that digs you right but you dont really like her that way
how do you let her down real easy so her feelings arent hurt but you dont get burned to a crisp and eaten
you just tell her shes not your true love
everyone knows what happens when you find your
shrek drops her on the ground hey
the sooner we get to duloc the better
youre gonna love it there princess
and what of my groom to be
whats he like
let me put it this way princess
men of farquaads stature are in short supply
he and donkey laugh shrek then proceeds to splash water onto his face to wash off the dust and grime
i dont know
there are those who think little of him
they laugh again fiona stop it
stop it both of you
youre just jealous you can never measure up to a great ruler like lord farquaad
yeah well maybe youre right princess
but ill let you do the measuring when you see him tomorrow
looks at the setting sun tomorrow
itll take that long
shouldnt we stop to make camp
no thatll take longer
we can keep going
but theres robbers in the woods
time out shrek
camp is starting to sound good
hey come on
im scarier than anything were going to see in this forest
i need to find somewhere to camp now
both donkey and shreks ears lower as they shrink away from her
shrek has found a cave that appears to be in good order
he shoves a stone boulder out of the way to reveal the cave
shrek we can do better than that
i dont think this is fit for a princess
no no its perfect
it just needs a few homey touches
he hears a tearing noise and looks over at fiona who has torn the bark off of a tree
well gentlemen i bid thee good night
goes into the cave and puts the bark door up behind her you want me to read you a bedtime story
os i said good night
shrek looks at donkey for a second and then goes to move the boulder back in front of the entrance to the cave with fiona still inside
shrek what are you doing
laughs i just you know oh come on
i was just kidding
shrek and donkey are sitting around a campfire
they are staring up into the sky as shrek points out certain star constellations to donkey
and uh that one thats throwback the only ogre to ever spit over three wheat fields
hey can you tell my future from these stars
the stars dont tell the future donkey
they tell stories
look theres bloodnut the flatulent
you can guess what hes famous for
i know youre making this up
there he is and theres the group of hunters running away from his stench
that aint nothin but a bunch of little dots
you know donkey sometimes things are more than they appear
heaves a big sigh hey shrek what we gonna do when we get our swamp anyway
you know when were through rescuing the princess
donkey theres no we
theres no our
theres just me and my swamp
the first thing im gonna do is build a ten foot wall around my land
you cut me deep shrek

why dont you want to talk about it
why do you want to talk about it
why are you blocking
im not blocking
oh yes you are
donkey im warning you
who you trying to keep out
pause oh now were gettin somewhere
grins at this point fiona pulls the door away from the entrance to the cave and peaks out
neither of the guys see her
for the love of pete
gets up and walks over to the edge of the cliff and sits down whats your problem
what you got against the whole world anyway
look im not the one with the problem okay
its the world that seems to have a problem with me
people take one look at me and go
a big stupid ugly ogre
they judge me before they even know me
thats why im better off alone
you know what
when we met i didnt think you was just a big stupid ugly ogre
yeah i know
so uh are there any donkeys up there
well theres um gabby the small and annoying
okay okay i see it now
the big shiny one right there
that one there
fiona puts the door back
thats the moon
duloc farquaads bedroom the camera pans over a lot of wedding stuff
soft music plays in the background
farquaad is in bed watching as the magic mirror shows him princess fiona
again show me again
mirror mirror show her to me
show me the princess
the mirror rewinds and begins to play again from the beginning
farquaad looks down at his bare chest and pulls the sheet up to cover himself as though fiona could see him as he gazes sheepishly at her image in the
fiona walks out of the cave
she glances at shrek and donkey who are still sleeping
she wanders off into the woods and comes across a blue bird
she begins to sing
the bird sings along with her
she hits higher and higher notes and the bird struggles to keep up with her
suddenly the pressure of the note is too big and the bird explodes
fiona looks a little sheepish but she eyes the eggs that the bird left behind
time lapse fiona is now cooking the eggs for breakfast
shrek and donkey are still sleeping
shrek wakes up and looks at fiona
donkeys talking in his sleep
quietly mmm yeah you know i like it like that
come on baby
i said i like it
donkey wake up
shakes him huh
stretches and yawns good morning
hm how do you like your eggs
oh good morning princess
fiona gets up and sets the eggs down in front of them
whats all this about
you know we kind of got off to a bad start yesterday
i wanted to make it up to you
i mean after all you did rescue me
donkey sniffs the eggs and licks his lips
well eat up
weve got a big day ahead of us
walks off they are once again on their way
they are walking through the forest
its a compliment
better out than in i always say
laughs well its no way to behave in front of a princess
fiona belches thanks
shes as nasty as you are
chuckles you know youre not exactly what i expected
well maybe you shouldnt judge people before you get to know them
she smiles and then continues walking singing softly
suddenly from out of nowhere a man swings down and swoops fiona up into a tree
to robin hood what are you doing
be still mon cherie for i am you savior
and i am rescuing you from this green
kisses up her arm while fiona pulls back in disgust
thats my princess
go find you own
cant you see im a little busy here
getting fed up look pal i dont know who you think you are
oh how rude
please let me introduce myself
oh merry men
laughs suddenly an accordion begins to play and the merry men pop out from the bushes
they begin to sing robins theme song
ta dah dah dah whoo
i steal from the rich and give to the needy
he takes a wee percentage but im not greedy
i rescue pretty damsels man im good
what a guy monsieur hood
break it down
i like an honest fight and a saucy little maid
what hes basically saying is he likes to get
when an ogre in the bush grabs a lady by the tush
when a beautys with a beast it makes me awfully mad
hes mad hes really really mad
ill take my blade and ram it through your heart keep your eyes on me boys cause im about to start
there is a grunt as fiona swings down from the tree limb and knocks robin hood unconscious
man that was annoying
shrek looks at her in admiration
oh you little shoots an arrow at fiona but she ducks out of the way the arrow flies toward donkey who jumps into shreks arms to get out of the
the arrow proceeds to just bounce off a tree
another fight sequence begins and fiona gives a karate yell and then proceeds to beat the crap out of the merry men
there is a very interesting matrix moment here when fiona pauses in mid air to fix her hair
finally all of the merry men are down and fiona begins walking away
uh shall we
hold the phone
drops donkey and begins walking after fiona oh
whoa whoa whoa
hold on now
where did that come from
that was amazing
where did you learn that
laughs when one lives alone uh one has to learn these things in case theres a
gasps and points theres an arrow in your butt
turns and looks oh would you look at that
he goes to pull it out but flinches because its tender oh no
this is all my fault
im so sorry
walking up why
oh no shreks gonna die
donkey im okay
you cant do this to me shrek
im too young for you to die

turn your head and cough

if you want to help shrek run into the woods and find me a blue flower with red thorns
blue flower red thorns

if you see a long tunnel stay away from the light
blue flower red thorns
runs off what are the flowers for
like its obvious for getting rid of donkey

gives the arrow a little pull jumps away ow
easy with the yankin
as they continue to talk fiona keeps going after the arrow and shrek keeps dodging her hands
im sorry but it has to come out
no its tender
now hold on
what youre doing is the opposite of help
look time out
grunts as shrek puts his hand over her face to stop her from getting at the arrow okay
what do you propose we do
donkey is still looking for the special flower
blue flower red thorns
blue flower red thorns
blue flower red thorns
this would be so much easier if i wasnt color blind
blue flower red thorns
hold on shrek
rips a flower off a nearby bush that just happens to be a blue flower with red thorns ow
i can nearly see the head
shrek grunts as she pulls its just about
he jerks and manages to fall over with fiona on top of him ahem
throwing fiona off of him nothing happend
we were just uh look if you wanted to be alone all you had to do was ask
oh come on
thats the last thing on my mind
the princess here was just fiona pulls the arrow out ugh
he turns to look at fiona who holds up the arrow with a smile ow
hey whats that
nervous chuckle thats
is that blood
shrek walks over and picks him up as they continue on their way
there is a montage of scenes as the group heads back to duloc
shrek crawling up to the top of a tree to make it fall over a small brook so that fiona wont get wet
shrek then gets up as donkey is just about to cross the tree and the tree swings back into its upright position and donkey flies off
shrek swatting and a bunch of flies and mosquitoes
fiona grabs a nearby spiderweb thats on a tree branch and runs through the field swinging it around to catch the bugs
she then hands it to shrek who begins eating like its a treat
as he walks off she licks her fingers
shrek catching a toad and blowing it up like a balloon and presenting it to fiona
fiona catching a snake blowing it up fashioning it into a balloon animal and presenting it to shrek
the group arriving at a windmill that is near duloc
there it is princess
your future awaits you
yeah i know

fiona goes inside the windmill and closes the door
donkey looks at shrek with a new eye

sighs donkey looks over at the large pile of firewood there already is
donkey opens the door to the windmill and walks in
fiona is nowhere to be seen
princess where are you
fiona looks at donkey from the shadows but we cant see her
its very spooky in here
i aint playing no games
suddenly fiona falls from the railing
she gets up only she doesnt look like herself
she looks like an ogre and donkey starts freaking out
no its okay
what did you do with the princess
donkey im the princess
its me in this body
oh my god
you ate the princess
to her stomach can you hear me

donkey looks into her eyes as she pets his muzzle and he quiets down
what happened to you

was it something you ate
cause i told shrek those rats was a bad idea
you are what you eat i said
i ive been this way as long as i can remember
what do you mean

by night one way by day another
this shall be the norm
until you find true loves first kiss
and then take loves true form
ah thats beautiful
i didnt know you wrote poetry
its a spell
sigh when i was a little girl a witch cast a spell on me
every night i become this
this horrible ugly beast
i was placed in a tower to await the day my true love would rescue me
thats why i have to marry lord farquaad tomorrow before the sun sets and he sees me like this
begins to cry all right all right
look its not that bad
youre not that ugly
well i aint gonna lie
you are ugly
but you only look like this at night

princess how bout if you dont marry farquaad

only my true loves kiss can break the spell
but you know um youre kind of an orge and shrek well you got a lot in common
shrek is walking towards the windmill with a sunflower in his hand
to himself princess i uh hows it going first of all
um good for me too
i saw this flower and thought of you because its pretty and well i dont really like it but i thought you might like it cause youre pretty
but i like you anyway

sighs im in trouble
okay here we go
he walks up to the door and pauses outside when he hears donkey and fiona talking
os i cant just marry whoever i want
take a good look at me donkey
i mean really who can ever love a beast so hideous and ugly
princess and ugly dont go together
thats why i cant stay here with shrek
shrek steps back in shock
os my only chance to live happily ever after is to marry my true love
shrek heaves a deep sigh
he throws the flower down and walks away
dont you see donkey
thats just how it has to be
its the only way to break the spell
you at least gotta tell shrek the truth
you cant breathe a word
no one must ever know
whats the point of being able to talk if you gotta keep secrets
promise you wont tell
all right all right
i wont tell him
but you should
goes outside i just know before this is over im gonna need a whole lot of serious therapy
look at my eye twitchin
fiona comes out the door and watches him walk away
she looks down and spots the sunflower
she picks it up before going back inside the windmill
donkey is asleep
shrek is nowhere to be seen
fiona is still awake
she is plucking petals from the sunflower
i tell him i tell him not
i tell him i tell him not
i tell him
she quickly runs to the door and goes outside shrek
shrek theres something i want
she looks and sees the rising sun and as the sun crests the sky she turns back into a human
just as she looks back at the sun she sees shrek stomping towards her
are you all right
never been better
i i dont theres something i have to tell you
you dont have to tell me anything princess
i heard enough last night
you heard what i said
i thought youd understand
oh i understand
like you said who could love a hideous ugly beast
but i thought that wouldnt matter to you
well it does
fiona looks at him in shock
he looks past her and spots a group approaching
ah right on time
princess ive brought you a little something
farquaad has arrived with a group of his men
he looks very regal sitting up on his horse
you would never guess that hes only like feet tall
donkey wakes up with a yawn as the soldiers march by
whatd i miss
whatd i miss
spots the soldiers muffled who said that
couldnt have been the donkey
now hand it over
very well ogre
holds out a piece of paper the deed to your swamp cleared out as agreed
take it and go before i change my mind
shrek takes the paper forgive me princess for startling you but you startled me for i have never seen such a radiant beauty before
im lord farquaad
oh no no
farquaad snaps his fingers forgive me my lord for i was just saying a short
watches as farquaad is lifted off his horse and set down in front of her
he comes to her waist
oh that is so sweet
you dont have to waste good manners on the ogre
its not like it has feelings
no youre right
donkey watches this exchange with a curious look on his face
princess fiona beautiful fair flawless fiona

montage of different scenes
shrek arriving back home
fiona being fitted for the wedding dress
donkey at a stream running into the dragon
shrek cleaning up his house
fiona eating dinner alone
shrek eating dinner alone
shrek is eating dinner when he hears a sound outside
he goes outside to investigate
donkey ignores him and continues with what hes doing
what are you doing
i would think of all people you would recognize a wall when you see one
but the walls supposed to go around my swamp not through it
it is around your half

so um what did fiona say about me
what are you asking me for
why dont you just go ask her
well never make it in time
ha ha ha
never fear for where theres a will theres a way and i have a way
whistles suddenly the dragon arrives overhead and flies low enough so they can climb on
i guess its just my animal magnetism
they both laugh
aw come here you
gives donkey a noogie all right all right
dont get all slobbery
no one likes a kiss ass
all right hop on and hold on tight
i havent had a chance to install the seat belts yet
they climb aboard the dragon and she takes off for duloc
fiona and farquaad are getting married
the whole town is there
the prompter card guy holds up a card that says revered silence
people of duloc we gather here today to bear witness to the union
eyeing the setting sun um of our new king
could we just skip ahead to the i dos
chuckles and then motions to the priest to indulge fiona go on
some guards are milling around
suddenly the dragon lands with a boom
the guards all take off running
to dragon go ahead have some fun
if we need you ill whistle
how about that
she nods and goes after the guards shrek wait wait
wait a minute
you wanna do this right dont you
at the church door what are you talking about
theres a line you gotta wait for
the preachers gonna say speak now or forever hold your peace
thats when you say i object
i dont have time for this
what are you doing
listen to me
look you love this woman dont you
you wanna hold her
singing james brown style then you got to got to try a little tenderness
normal the chicks love that romantic crap
cut it out
when does this guy say the line
we gotta check it out
as the priest talks we see donkeys shadow through one of the windows shrek tosses him up so he can see
and so by the power vested in me
outside what do you see
the whole towns in there
inside i now pronounce you husband and wife
outside theyre at the altar
inside king and queen
outside mother fletcher
he already said it
oh for the love of pete
he runs inside without catching donkey who hits the ground hard
running toward the alter i object
the whole congregation gasps as they see shrek
oh now what does he want
to congregation as he reaches the front of the church hi everyone
havin a good time are ya
i love duloc first of all
what are you doing here
really its rude enough being alive when no one wants you but showing up uninvited to a wedding
i need to talk to you
oh now you wanna talk
its a little late for that so if youll excuse me but you cant marry him
and why not
because because hes just marring you so he can be king
fiona dont listen to him
hes not your true love
and what do you know about true love
well i uh i mean oh this is precious
the ogee has fallen in love with the princess
oh good lord
laughs the prompter card guy holds up a card that says laugh
the whole congregation laughs
an ogre and a princess
shrek is this true
fiona my love were but a kiss away from our happily ever after
now kiss me
puckers his lips and leans toward her but she pulls back
looking at the setting sun by night one way by day another
to shrek i wanted to show you before
she backs up and as the sun sets she changes into her ogre self
she gives shrek a sheepish smile
well uh that explains a lot
fiona smiles ugh
i order you to get that out of my sight now
get them both
the guards run in and separate fiona and shrek
shrek fights them
this hocus pocus alters nothing
this marriage is binding and that makes me king
no let go of me
dont just stand there you morons
get out of my way
ill make you regret the day we met
ill see you drawn and quartered
youll beg for death to save you
hold a dagger to fionas throat and as for you my wife
ill have you locked back in that tower for the rest of your days
shrek manages to get a hand free and he whistles
i will have order
i will have perfection
i will have donkey and the dragon show up and the dragon leans down and eats farquaad aaaah
i got a dragon here and im not afraid to use it
the dragon roars
im a donkey on the edge
the dragon belches and farquaads crown flies out of her mouth and falls to the ground
they never last do they
the congregation cheers
go ahead shrek
i i love you
smiles i love you too
shrek and fiona kiss
thelonius takes one of the cards and writes awwww on the back and then shows it to the congregation
suddenly the magic of the spell pulls fiona away
shes lifted up into the air and she hovers there while the magic works around her
until you find true loves first kiss and then take loves true form
take loves true form
take loves true form
suddenly fionas eyes open wide
shes consumed by the spell and then is slowly lowered to the ground
going over to her fiona
are you all right
standing up shes still an ogre well yes
but i dont understand
im supposed to be beautiful
but you are beautiful
they smile at each other
chuckles i was hoping this would be a happy ending
shrek and fiona kiss
and the kiss fades into
their wedding kiss
shrek and fiona are now married
im a believer by smashmouth is played in the background
shrek and fiona break apart and run through the crowd to their awaiting carriage
which is made of a giant onion
fiona tosses her bouquet which both cinderella and snow white try to catch
but they end up getting into a cat fight and so the dragon catches the bouquet instead
the gingerbread man has been mended somewhat and now has one leg and walks with a candy cane cane
shrek and fiona walk off as the rest of the guests party and donkey takes over singing the song
god bless us every one
as hes done singing and we fade to black oh thats funny
i cant breathe
i cant breathe
