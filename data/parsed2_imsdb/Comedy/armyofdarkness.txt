shooting script this is ash mid twenties square jaw firmly set and a pair of haunted eyes which dart about quickly in fear
ash speaks to the camera with urgency why would you say that i am insane
i wouldnt say that ive lost my mind simply because ive heard the voices and seen the godless things moving in the woods
if anything i think more clearly now than ever before
i know now that there is such a thing as a living evil
a dark and shapeless thing that lives not in the spaces we know but between them
in the dark
in the night
and it wants the exact same thing as you and i a chance at warm life on this earth
it doesnt care that is already had that chance
now listen closely because there isnt much time
listen and believe because its all true
nestled in a dark forest
through the window we see the tiny figure of ash picking up a book from a desk
i first saw the damn thing at that blasted cabin
an ancient sumarrian text bound in human flesh and inked in human blood
it contained bizarre burial rites prophesies
and instruction for demon resurrection
it was never meant for the world of the living
ash flips through the pages from the book of the dead
the book awoke something dark in the woods
inscribed on the pages
illustrations of demonic faces with white eyes
we take the point of view of a wind like demon swooping low through the woods toward the cabin
camera rips through the cabin door and comes upon a screaming ash
it got into my hand and it went bad
twisting into a claw before the flashing thunder clouds
so i lopped it off at the wrist
ash severs his hand from his wrist with the chainsaw
sweep past the moon
in order to rid myself of the foul thing i read from a passage in the book that was supposed to open a hole
a hole in time that would send the evil back
and it worked
recites the incantation from the necronomicon
the time vortex is created
trees and a delta oldsmobile are sucked up into the funnel cloud
i just didnt plan on coming along
ash now armed with shotgun and chainsaw is swallowed by the funnel cloud of the time vortex
ash is rocketing through a funnel of swirling clouds
he is swept away from us hand over foot through the dark void of time
swirls through blackness as a chorus of womens voices build to eerie crescendo from a musical note to a scream
the smoke swirls pulls in upon itself like a thing alive and forms the words vs the smoke is wisked away then reforms as
the title billows past camera revealing
its hands winding backwards at an insane rate spins angrily past revealing other debris that has been swept up into this funnel cloud
tumbling weightless through this void we find
he screams but there is no sound
only the steady beating of his heart
he shields his eyes from a sudden bright light
the funnel cloud electrifies
rips at the fabric of time
all is quiet
then an electrical disturbance in the shape of a human body flashes briefly and is gone
a moment latter ash appears and tumbles from the sky falling past camera
ash falls to the dust
his double barrelled shotgun lands beside him
the oldsmobile comes crashing to the ground a moment later
looks up from the dust to behold
in th century armor ride up over a hill
they halt before ash
thrusts his longsword into the air shouting hail to him who has come from the sky to deliver us from the terror of the deadites
stares in confusion at the strange medieval figures
join in the chant and hail ash but suddenly stop as
the muscular commander of the group gallops his horse into frame followed by four horsemen who are his lieutenants
arthur lifts his iron visor and evaluates ash
the delta oldsmobile
the chainsaw strapped to ashs back
the handless stump of ashs right arm
waves a shaky hand
take is easy now chief
i dont know how i got here and im not lookin for any trouble
an elderly man in a long black cloak steps forward
my lord arthur i believe he is the promised one written of in the necronomicon
brings his sword down across ashs chest
ash cries out in pain as
a thin red gash
as a man bleeds
the one written of in the book would not bleed
and camera pans to four prisoners bound in iron shackles
likely he is one of henrys men
i say to the pit with him
if he is truly the promised one
he will emerge
the pits a fair test
to the pit with the blackard
charges his horse at ash
but he is met with the wooden stock of ashs shotgun as it swings into frame cracking against his jaw
he tumbles from the horse
leaps atop gold tooths horse and jerks the reigns
rears up kicking its hooves into the air
gallops off as warrior runs at him
ash kicks him in the face as he gallops past
the warrior is sent reeling
galloping over a hill
he is almost thrown by the horse but manages to hang on for dear life
where the hell they put the stirrups on this thing
grasping at the side of the horse hoping to find some purchase
he rides past camera almost falling from the horse
fetch me the blackard
unsheathe their broadswords and gallop after ash
the remaining warriors watch for sport
they are gaining an ash
glances behind him
they diverge to either side of camera
whips his horse
rides up alongside ash and swings his broadsword
ducks the blade
rides up alongside ashs other flank
he swings and lands the flat part of his blade along ashs back
ducks as the first horseman swings his blade again
ash looks left
winds up for another blow
yanks back upon his horses reigns
running side by side
ashs horse drops back suddenly
slams the first horseman across the face
is knocked from his steed
is moving fast when he hits the ground
his armored form tumbles end over end in the dust clanging to a halt against a rock
turns around and gallops back toward ash
ride at one another
swinging his broadsword
he inserts the stump of his right arm into the female end of his chainsaw arm bracket
he twists his stump and the chainsaw bracket locks into place
he thrusts his chainsaw arm outward pulling on the starter cord putt putt putt
the engine wont turn over
he curses and yanks again
he leans from his horse and swings his broadsword mightily
the flat portion of the blade connects
is knocked from his steed
he tumbles to the dust narrowly escaping his own horses hooves
rolls to his feet and spins to the sound of approaching hooves
charges and swings his broadsword
raises his chainsaw
he deflects the blow
ash swings the chainsaw in a roundhouse motion clipping the second horseman as he rides past
is knocked from his horse
bounces along the rocky ground kicking up dust
slams against the back of ashs skull
he looks up in pain to
the sun over his shoulder
gallop up dismount and surround ash with swords drawn
bring the prisoner
the warriors surge upon ash
his sawed off shotgun and chainsaw are taken from him
secure ash to a set of iron shackles that painfully extend his arms
a collar forces his neck upward
to the castle
prods ash along with a rod attached to his spiked iron collar
the warriors gallop off forcing ash and the other prisoners to run alongside them
picks up the chainsaw and sawed off shotgun from the dust
he is troubled by the strange objects
sunlight glints off the blade of the chainsaw blinding the camera
blazing in the sky above the wasteland
bound in his iron shackles whipped by gold tooth who rides alongside him
move along now
camera pans along the line of arthur and his horsemen to find a th century battle castle built on the edge of a great cliff
a drawbridge is lowered
arthurs warriors ride over it
shackled alongside other prisoners is prodded inside the castle walls
a striking blonde haired maiden rushes into frame
she searches the faces of arthurs warriors and grows concerned
she pushes through a crowd of villagers and calls up to arthur atop his horse
where is my brother
did he not ride with you
and fought valiantly
but last night fell in battle to duke henrys men
her face does not immediately register the grief
she attempts to step forward but stumbles
she steadies herself against the stone wall
her eyes harden as she sees the first of the shackled prisoners a semi conscious ash
she flushes with anger and races up to him
she spits and kicks at him as hes dragged along
a pox on your throat
thou art a murderer
a black murderer
cries as the village women attempt to soothe her
may you be consoled by their suffering in the pit
iron keys rattle
the shackles are unlocked
ash and the prisoners rub their reddened wrists
they are pushed at swordpoint towards a circular iron grate that sits atop the ground
this is the pit
looks to the jeering villagers that surround the pit wondering what they have in store for him
stares at him in hatred
eyes ash curiously
this is duke henry the red
you sir are not one of my vassals
who are you
who wants to know
i am henry the red
duke of shale
lord of the northlands and leader of its people
you aint leadin but two things now pal
jack and shit
and jack left town
address the doomed men there is an evil that has awakened in this land
and whilst my people fight for their very souls against it you duke henry the red wage war on us
your people are no better than the foul corruption that lies in the bowels of that pit
may god have mercy on your souls
crank a massive wench
chains tighten and the heavy iron lid slides back revealing a dark hole
a echoed wailing rises up
stiffen in fear
into the pit with the bloodthirsty sons of whores
she jams a meat pie into her mouth and cheers excitedly as as hes thrown down into the pit
he disappears into the blackness
watching with disbelief
we hear the warriors echoed cry of terror then a splash as he hits bottom
looking down into the blackness we hear i beg of you
by all thats holy
lower a rope
oh for the love of god
the sound of ripping and scratching
the shriek of terror is cut short as
erupts upward from the pit
is frozen in fear
jerks from the pit to
making a break for it
hes past the guards heading for the open drawbridge
spot him and fire arrows
they bounce off the warriors armor
hes makes it to the open drawbridge when
pulls back a iron arrow in his crossbow
he lets it fly
camera swish pans with arrow
the iron arrow punctures the warriors armor pegging him to a wooden post
he dies standing
they turn their attention to the remaining prisoners camera pans from their bloodthirsty faces to the next prisoner in line
turns to arthur and in a desperate cowardly plea hey i never even saw these assholes before
he spins to duke henry the red
you gotta tell em you dont know me
we never met
i do not believe that he shall listen
grab ash and shove him into the pit
tumbles down into the pit
he lands in a steaming pool of foul water at the pits bottom
he stands and coughs out a mouthful of the rancid water
he looks about
underground caverns disappear into the blackness
spins to a small sound
just the mist rising from the water
shifts his glance again
rounds a corner and disappears from sight
doesnt notice the misty water behind him beginning to stir
a hand emerges
silently a pair of bone white eyes break the surface
but theres nothing there
as he turns back around he is confronted by
its rotted corpse rockets up from the water inches from ashs face
putrid water drains from its empty eye sockets and mouth
it jerks like a marionette as it advances
and backs against the steep rock wall of the pit
he tries to scale the steep face
he gets one foot up
clutches ashs ankle and yanks him back down
he falls away from the wall his arms flailing
hoot and cheer for ash to be devoured
grabs ash and begins hammering him with her rotted fists
shouts for ashs death
the deadites fist enters frame slugging ash
is knocked back into a shallow pool of steaming water
races toward ash leaps into the air and comes down with a kneedrop onto ashs stomach
cries out in pain
cross to form a scissor lock around the deadites throat
he flips the beast
rides into the castle dismounts and pushes through the crowd with a bundle wrapped in cloth
grabs ash by the throat
is thrown against the rock wall of the pit
shouts down at ash
trying to hear what the wiseman is saying
his head jolts backward barely avoiding the beasts wild swing
ash squints to discern wiseman john throwing something down to him an object falling at him through the glare above
blinding beams of sunlight bouncing off its blade of steel
summons his strength and leaps upward
ascending his teeth gritted every muscle straining he soars past camera
ash rising up through frame to meet the falling saw
snags the chainsaw locking in onto his wrist bracket
he lands on his feet in the path of the approaching beast
come on you blasted piece of he thrusts out his chainsaw arm yanking the starter cord and
gasp at the roar of the chainsaw
blue exhaust billows up from the pit
lunges at ash
is splattered with black bile
flies upward past the face of the bewildered beast
as it ascends ash and the deadite grow smaller below
flies up into frame and latches onto the face of a drunken spectator
its fingers dig into the eyes and nose
he shrieks and flails about into the screaming crowd
a warrior tears the hand free from his face tossing it back down into the pit
raises the chainsaw blade and neatly bisects the falling deadite hand
he spins and with a roundhouse blow
ash decapitates the beast
stop cheering from the deadite
theyre starting to like this guys guts and style
of the beast sink beneath the murky waters of the pit
climbs the steep wall of the pit when a second deadite emerges from the earthen wall before him
slams the butt end of the chainsaw into the beast knocking it back into the water
comes up over the edge of the pit
ashs bloody hand
then his bruised face
covered in the black blood of the deadites
he crawls to his feet
ash tuns to the crowd his list clenched
all right now
who wants to be next
who wants some
look at ash stupidly
ash shoves him
you want some more
gold tooth and the others give him a wide berth
ash calls out to henry
now climb on those horses and get out of here
quickly mount horses
henry is my prisoners
he slaps henrys horse
to gallop off toward the open drawbridge and freedom
stares at ash with hatred
for that i shall see you dead
removes his sawed off shotgun from wiseman johns horse and turns to arthur then the crowd
this is my boomstick
its a twelve gauge double barreled remington pump
next one of you primitives touch me
pointing the barrel just past arthur
he but no one else has spotted the surviving second deadite crawling up from the pit on the forgotten chain
the crowds gasp is cut short by
the shotgun belches flame
the blast cuts the chain leaving the deadite teetering at the pits edge
the second shot blows the beast into a backflip sending it summersaulting down into the pit
echoes off the mountains like distant thunder
look to ash in reverence
twirls the shotgun about western style whoosh whoosh whoosh
and holsters it
bring me your hoo do man
fly from a barren tree
it prowls skimming the surface of the ground moving swiftly past rocks and over the crest of a hill revealing
a massive grouping of freestanding rectangular stones each twenty feet tall
the remains of an ancient temple
in the center of the ruins there burns a roaring bonfire
as old woman stirs a cauldron atop the flames
nearby arthur converses with his four lieutenants
opens his mouth to allow a spoonful of food to enter
no sooner has he swallowed then a piece of fruit is offered
he waves it away with a satisfied burp and turns to drink from a goblet on wine brought to his lips by a female hand
sits across the flames from arthur and his men
she bandages ashs wounds
is dresses in a revealing tunic
she looks good
i pray thee to forgive me
i believed thee one of henrys men
she touches ashs hand
ash turns away first you wanta kill me now ya wanna kiss me
he spits out a mouthful of grape seeds
lady just leave me alone
im sorry mlord
tis a cruel time for us
the wisemen say you are the promised one
our only hope against the darkness that has descended on this land
she stares deeply into his eyes
i think not
i feel that there is reason for your being here
it is no accident
they sit in tall stone chairs across the fire from ash
well what is it
can you send me back or not
only the necronomicon has the power
a power which we both require
it contains passages that can dispel the evil from this place and return you to your time
yeah thats the thing that got me here
it is in a place far from here
it can only be retrieved by the promised one
other warriors have tried
their widows grieve still
we have waited long years for you
out only hope is the necronomicon
thou must undertake to quest for it
alone must thou travel to a distant cemetery
there thou shalt find it
now way no day
only place im goin is home
a sudden gust of wind whips up the flames of the fire
around the fire begin to snarl and fight
turn to see
now standing too close to the fire
her robes ignites
she does not respond as flames sweep up her body
she continues to stir the caldron
his haw drops
he slowly stands as
spins sharply to him
her voice changes as she shrieks her eyes are bone white
she is possessed by the dark spirit
her burning body is violently jerked about in the air by invisible hands
her blackened lips pull back in a wild animal snarl
with two voice at once collapses
her face turned away from the wisemen as it lays in the dust
unseen by all her bone white eyes flare open
a nasty grin forms on her face as she lies in the dust
behind her the wisemen approach
kneels and reaches for her
clutches wiseman john not allowing him to touch her
its a trick
get an axe
awakens from her false slumber with a terrible bark
in a frenzy she hurls wiseman john into the bonfire
he screams and rolls in the dust extinguishing the flames
with her great strength the possessed woman pushes upon one of the giant stone archways
it topples over crushing two warriors beneath it
topples the next stone
which topples the next which sets off a chain reaction
like giant dominoes they fall
watches the spectacle in horror as he sees
the gigantic falling stones coming right at sheila
coming toward camera
does a flying leap and tackles sheila knocking her out of the stones deadly path
rolls across the dusty stone courtyard
rolls into frame and glances up to see
rushing through the air at him with a shriek
latches onto ash like an iron trap knocking them both to the ground
rolls the possessed woman over and into the path of
the falling gigantic domino like stones
shrieks in agony as
the multi ton stone crushes her legs to paste
her legs are pinned but still she battles on clutching ash about his throat
gasps for breath as he reaches behind him into the flames of the fire his fingers groping for a weapon
her blackened lips pull back and her mouth opens to an impossibly large size like a snake about to eat an egg
grasps a flaming log with his bare hands and rams it down the monsters oversized throat
grab the beast and pull it off of ash
arthur comes to meet them
he carries a double bladed battle axe
vomits out the flaming log taking off a mans head
the evil lives
slay me and ten will rise to take my place
all will die
all will is brought down upon her throat
the possessed body flails and spasm beneath the warriors grip
rolls and comes to a halt at ashs feet
its eyes pop open
grabs the laughing head and tosses it into the darkness
the head sails away as the laughter receded
will thou quest for the necronomicon
ash and the blacksmith step into the shop
points to the hand piece on a hanging suit of battle armor
pounds upon the hand armor modifying it
knits a grey woolen garment as she watches ash
attaches the shock absorber spring to the iron hand
tightens the tension on the shock absorber springs with a ratchet like device
extends his arm triggering the tightly wound spring
snaps open with great force
clenches closed with such great power that it bends a iron goblet
he studies his new hand
it will do nicely
stares over the castle wall to the foreboding wasteland with apprehension
the wind blows upon his hair
sheila appears behind him
she drapes a grey garment over ash
a magnificent cape
ash draws her body close to his
he wraps the cape around her
together they stare off into the night then turn to one another and kiss
arthurs castle in the distance
in the foreground five men on horseback appear over a ridge thundering toward us
their long wool capes billowing up behind them in the wind
arthur and wiseman john ride flanked by two of arthurs warriors
camera pulls back to reveal
he wears an iron breastplate with the insignia of arthurs army that compliments his new spring powered iron hand
his chainsaw juts from its saddle holster on the horses back
ashs cape billows as he rides
the horsemen wind down a trail
suddenly the horses rear up
the men gain control of the frightened steeds
whats going on
it disappears abruptly into a swirling wall of mist that emits an eerie whistling
this is the edge of the land ruled by the dark spirit
this path will lead you to an unholy place
there the necronomicon awaits
anxiously eyes the wall of swirling mist
finish placing saddlebags of water and food onto
which nervously pounds the earth with its hooves
lord arthur he is supplied
now i beg of you let us leave this foul place
moves close to ash
as thou removest the book from its cradle you must recite these words
clatoo verata nicto
clatto verata nicto
clatto verata nicto
i got it
i got it
i know your damn words
now you get this straight i get the book you send me back
thats the deal
after that im history
ash rears up on his horse and gallops into the mist watch as ash disappears
the sound of thunderous hoofs
a form materializes out of the fog it is ash
he whips the horse
he gallops past
camera pans as he disappears into the thick fog
rides out of the wall of mist
he finds himself on a trail leading into a thick forest
rides slowly on through the darkening woods
he hears a sound and look to
a branch scraping against the bark of a tree
hears a womans soft laughter
he glance to
and nothing more
powers through the woods toward ash
kick his steed and bolts
sweeps over the forest floor gaining velocity
frantically weaves his horse around storm felled trees which jut from the ground
rips through the trees splintering them to toothpicks
it burrows underground and resurfaces always closing upon ash
jerks upon the reins and his steed leaps a fallen tree
he gracefully leaps a second tree
but as he leaps over the third he is ripped off the horse by a low branch
he falls hard to the mud as the horse gallops off
he groggily stands and stumbles onward
follows ash down a wooded trail
a grain storage house in the clearing ahead
comes upon the sheds door
he heaves his body against it but it wont give
a log that serves as the doors bolt holds fast
emerges from over the ridge
unscrews his iron hand and holsters it
he slings the chainsaw from his shoulder and snaps it onto his stump bracket
he threads the chainsaw starter cord through the v shaped slot that extends from his breastplate
he thrusts out his arm and the chainsaw roars to life
the blade bites into the log that bolts the door
halfway through the log
the chainsaw dies
he jerks out his arm to restart it
blasted piece of junk
delivers a mighty kick to the door
the partially cut log gives way
ash tumbles into the storage shed
he slams the door shut and slides the remainder of the log across the latch re bolting it
hammers at the door of the shed
a terrified ash braces his back against the door
earth shaking in its intensity
the planks of the door shudder behind ash
presses himself against the door for all hes worth praying that whatever it out there wont get in
the crack widens
behind ash begins to buckle beneath the hammering blows
begins to scream
and the banging halts
all is quiet
ash hugs the door
shaking in the silence
and thats when it hits
like a locomotive
ash and the door he braces are blasted away from the wall of the shed as the evil force brings its tremendous power to bare
as they are swept up at super speed in the grip of the evil force
ash is seen rocketing through the long hallway of the shed spinning head over heels
ash rips through other doors taking them with him
ash is now sandwiched between two doors as he flies through the air
the roof of the shed ripples sending tiles and wood beams flying as the evil force surges through the shed like a tidal wave
it blows out from the place in a flying stack along with the other doors
the flying doors slam against a tree and fall to the ground in a stack
with ash out of sight glides forward into the woods
all is quiet
we hear the sound of a bolt moving
the doorknob turns slightly
the door swings upward and opens
revealing a somewhat flattened ash who picks his groggy and bruised self up
an empty place of stone and wood
driven by the wind the mills giant grinding wheel slowly turns with a squeak
enters the mill
the place is quiet
ash slumps down against a wall to catch his breath
this placell do for the night
get the book in the morning
shadows lengthen on the floor and stretch across the walls
peers through the window
a gigantic ball of fire as it sets behind the mill
the wind kicks up
listens as the cabin creaks like an old ship beneath the force of the gale
on the window quietly knock
ash shivers and rubs his arms for warmth
damn this cold
looks about the mill and spots an iron stove
pours out of ashs chainsaw over some logs in the stoves belly
lights the fire with his zippo lighter and huddles near the flame for warmth
least i wont freeze to death
he turns to a tiny sound
behind him through the window a large gnarled hand sweeps past
spins raises his shotgun and fires
the window is ripped away in a shower of glass
only the night woods
the gnarled hand comes back sweeping down in front of the broken window but its revealed to be just a tree branch swaying in the wind
he moves to the front door and peers out through a crack
through the crack in the door
camera pushes through the crack to the woods beyond
there is movement
the tiny figure of ash steps from the mill
he sweeps the barrel of the shotgun toward the sound of sticks breaking
it rears up on its hind legs
its front hoofs come down toward ash
leaps aside just in time
snags the horses reigns
the horse calms
ash ties it to a tree patting its head
a shadow passes behind him
he turns toward the mill
he sees am image of himself inside the mill
stares in disbelief then the wind slams the front door of the mill halting ashs view
ash races for the mill
races through the door and toward camera when
ashs reflection shatters
hes run into a mirror
shivering he picks himself up from the pile of broken glass
he moves to the fireplace and hunches before the flames camera pans to
each piece of mirror reflects an image of ash
from the eight pieces of mirror spring
two inch high versions of himself
they leap from the mirror fragments and land on the floor
is unaware of them as he kneels close to the fire
grab a discarded dinner fork
like men on a battering ram they race forward to jam it into ashs buttocks
screams in agony and jerks forward banging his head into the stove pipe
lift the barrel of the shotgun in ashs direction
another leaps upon the shotguns trigger
barely dives away from the blast the would have taken his head off
shriek with uncontrollable laughter
they jump away from the shotgun and scurry off across the floor
pulls the fork from his buttocks and heaves it
is running for his life as fast as his tiny legs will carry him
a giant projectile as it roars at camera
pan with it as it whooshes past
skewers tiny ash to the wooden wall of the mill
stumbles over a broom handle that has been thrust out in front of him by other tiny ashes
his head slams into a stove pipe
he lands with his cheek pressed against the hot stove
he pries his face loose with a spatula
is pushed off a high shelf
and spills slippery grease about the floor
with an upside down bucket on his head slips and falls back and forth on the grease
he stands and tries to dislodge the bucket
he trips over the broom handle again thrust in his path
he falls backward onto a crochet basket with knitting needles jutting from it
screams and jerks upward slamming his bucket head into the stove pipe
ash rips the bucket from his head then yanks the needles from his buttocks
he looks about for the little imps
crouching behind a log attempting to hide
has seen him
he accidentally elbows the log and tiny ash into the stoves fire
is burned alive
glances downward at the pitter patter sound of tiny feet
is dashing across the open expanse of floor
ashs gigantic foot comes down to crush the little man
tiny ash raises a rusty nail into the path of the descending foot
through ashs shoe
jerks his leg upward in pain
ash dances about the place hopping on one foot howling
he strays into the greasy area of the floor and stumbles over the broomstick again thrust in his path swung there by tiny ashes and
he almost regains his balance when he strays into the oil patch falls and hits his head on the stone floor
awakens on the floor of the mill like gulliver he is bound with tiny ropes
directly above him on the edge of a table
suspend tiny ash by his legs
stand atop ashs face
they push from either side of his nostrils plugging his nose
ashs mouth opens as he gasps for air
as he inhales
he free falls for a moment then the tiny body arcing to form a perfect swam dive plunges down into ashs opened throat
inhales the living beast whole
he chokes violently
he breaks his bonds an he hacks for breath
he puts his finger down his throat trying to make himself vomit up the little man to no avail
he looks about to crush some of the little ashes but they are gone
he places his hand on his stomach and dizzily stumbles to a chair
he goes pale
nasty little things inside me
he stands indignant but double over in sudden pain
well lets see how you like a little hot water
he grabs the hot kettle from the stove and pours the scalding contents painfully down his throat
he sets down the kettle and waits for a moment
a tiny scream emits from ashs stomach emits a bark of laughter
he clutches as his chest
then his arm
he rips back his shirt sleeve
we can see the outline of tiny ash s body squirming down ashs arm just beneath the skin
watches in horror as
squirms down his wrist and disappears into his iron hand
the iron hand snaps open and closes uncontrollably
the possessed iron hand swings at him
connects with an uppercut that knocks ash out of frame
lands next to an iron vice
he reaches for the evil hand
but the hand has grabbed a mallet that bonk bonks him on the head
ash is groggy as he is grabbed by the hair and yanked down into the opened vice
cranks the vices handle
tightens around ashs head
trapped he looks to
rummaging through a wooden toolbox
it comes upon a crude wooden punch
stabs rapidly at ashs good hand
but ash expertly dodges each stab with an opening of the fingers or a closing of the thumb is super fast motion
with is head still wedged in the vice
why you dirty little
has entered frame and clamps down upon ashs nose
he emits a nasal scream and shakes the pliers loose
soon as i get out of this thing dip into ashs mouth and clamps down upon a back molar
not the teeth
jerks his rear molar from his head and holds up the tooth for his inspection
it sets the tooth down nearly in front of him
the evil hand forms a fist and crushes the tooth to dust
it scurries from view
struggling in the grip of the vice
where the hell are ya
grabs a red hot fireplace poker from the fire
i cant see ya
raises a red hot fireplace poker and presses it against the right half of his body
no no not the poke sssssssssssss
jerks his head free from the vice with a scream
he holds up his iron hand
its back to normal
again under his control
but he halts abruptly as he feels a strange sensation his shoulder itches
he scratches it
the itch grows
it itches madly
he rips back his shirt
upon his shoulder
there it is the eyeball of evil ash
beneath it a mouth and nose begin to take shape on the surface of ashs back
shrieks and shrieks and races out of the mill
the camera follows him in docu horror style as he flees into the dark woods
staggers about in a frenzy stumbling over logs and through the brambles
he races up to the camera and cries out as this protrusion upon his shoulder becomes more pronounced
dear god its growing bigger
its taking the shape of a twin human head as it emerges from his shoulder
a head that looks similar to his own but is evil incarnate
he is now a man with two heads
staggers through the woods like a drunkard the two identical heads trading insults and sharply butting against one another
opens its mouth and bites the nose of the good ash head
retaliates by gouging the eyes of the bad ash head
collapses against a tree
under the light of the full moon we see a terrifying sight sprout from ashs body
rips out of his stomach
another foot pops out from his back
like a human spider he scurries about the forest floor propelled by his four arms and four legs
suddenly he stands and shrieks as the evil ash begins to pull away from the first
he literally splits into two
when its over there are two ashes
good ash and
they square off beneath the moonlight
circle one another like wolves
are you me
are goo me
you sound like a jerk
why are you doing this
cause the answers easy
its cause im the bad ash and yer
dances a funny jig around ash
he smacks ash across the face as he sings little goody two shoes little goody two shoes little good the shotgun barrel is suddenly shoved into his frame pointing at
the blast blows evil ash off his feet
blown backwards into a double backflip
slams against a tree upside down
then slides to the ground quite dead
clutching the smoldering shotgun
im the ash with the gun
staring down at the body of his evil self
i know better than to bury you whole
the giant blades of the mill are illuminated with bright flashes of lightning
the wind kicks up leaves as ash throws the body of his evil twin onto a workbench at the base of the windmill
the giant blades of the mill arc down into frame with a whoosh ashs hand light a torch
from the base of the windmill
across the body of evil ash to secure it
is switched on
it spews a plume of blue exhaust
falters for a moment as he stares down at the form of his evil twin
he grits his teeth
and lowers the saw to the grisly task
float past the moon
we hear the distant whine of the chainsaw
with shovel in hand drags a bloody burlap bag from the mill
grunting he pulls the remains of his evil twin to the base of an old oak tree in the graveyard
ash mumbles nervously to the bloodies burlap bag at his feet as he digs a grave
now you see whats what
mans body is his own personal property
dont anybody try to take that away from him
finishes digging and lifts the bloody burlap sack
as he heaves the bag into the grave the evil ash head spills out
its eyes pop open
it peers up at ash from the grave
it croaks youll never get that book
i will come back for you
hey whats that you got on your face
its eyes dart looking for something on its face when a shovelful of dirt is heaped atop it
as a shovelful of dirt is heaped atop the camera
buries it deep
he raises a crude burial marker high above his head muttering under his breath rest in pieces
backlit by the moon brings the burial maker swiftly into the grave
a flash of lightning reveals
in the distance
a burial place of evil
the old mill wheel groans in the gale
this must be it
moves toward the cemetery
in the center lies a massive slab of black stone
draws closer his teeth chattering as the wind blasts at him
he glances down to
sitting atop the ground leering up at camera with empty eye sockets
the wind whistles through the empty skull
the jaw bone drops open with a squeak
his hair is whipped up by the wind
he looks to
backlit by the rising moon creates eerie beams of light and shadow
arrives at the foot of the massive stone
atop it sits
the book of the dead
nobody said anything about that
that wiseman was so busy fillin me fulla his secret words and phrases and and his
bullshit he forgot to mention anything about that
like do i take all of em of one or em or what
he reaches for the first book and opens it
to reveal a black hole
screams erupt from the dark abyss of the book
it begins to suck things into it
dead leaves and mist are sucked into the book
wind hits ashs face as he feels the suction of the book growing stronger
is stretched as its pulled down into the book
ashs arms stretch down into the books black page
stretched and screaming is also pulled on by the book
a taffy stretched version of ash struggles against the pull of the black hole
he pulls free and snaps the book shut
his face vibrates like jello until it finally snaps back to normal
he turns to study
tries to decide between them
at first hes sure which one it is
then chiding himself for being so easily duped chooses the other
moves ever so slightly as he reaches for it
ash reaches for it again and the book bites him
rodent teeth have appeared on the surface of the book
the book flaps its pages and becomes airborne flying right at camera like a bat
swooping erratically around ashs head
shrieking chases ash around pecking at his neck
dear god help me
the batbook is pecking at his eyes
pulls it from his face and throws it
it lands back on its pedestal
faces the remaining book
he slowly reaches for it as the wind kicks up
ash gently lifts it and turns it over
its cover is bound in the dried skin of a mans face
two empty eye sockets stare out from it
this is the book of the dead
bristles in fear
say the words
he hesitates then calls out boldly
he deliberately muffles the last word that he cant remember
the wind stops
it seems to have worked
he looks about with growing confidence
but he loses his smile as
a low rumble is heard on the soundtrack
a tiny figure among the gravestones which tremble and one by one are thrust from the earth
hey wait a minute
i said the words
a violent storm in the distance
blows open revealing wiseman john
he looks at the gathering storm with foreboding
something is amiss
whinnie in hear
sheila steps into frame and stare fearfully out at the storm
ash runs for his horse clutching the necronomicon
rips up from a grave and grabs his leg
is knocked from ashs hand
reaches for it when a second skeleton hand rips from the ground and clutches his face
digs into ashs mouth
it jerks his face sideways to show him
that rip from the ground
toss ash to
grab ashs head and bang it on a rock
two of the six arms try to shake and slap some sense into him
a rotted fist is waved at him
another rotted arm backhands him
the arms thrust his face toward the skeleton hands
curl boney fingers clenching them into fists
the skeletal fists pepper ashs face with punches
leave me alone
leave me ahuuu
last out and snag ashs tongue between their boney pincers shutting ash up
with his tongue held he tries to speak again but the other skeletal hand slaps him shutting him up
both hands work double time at slapping him
his face has become a punching bag for the skeletal hands
they pull his ears and gouge his eyes
open his mouth wide with in a scream
the boney fist is thrust into ashs screaming mouth up to the skeletons boney elbow
they bulge as he swallow the arm
rips through the ground punching ash in the stomach
jerks backward vomiting out the skeletal arm
he tumbles to the ground
reach for him but he is too fast
he stamps on one of the skeletal arms pinning it to the ground
in a snarl keep you damn filthy bones outta my mouth
he breaks the boney arm in two and runs away from the sea of limbs
a bone arm rips from the grave and reaches for the book of the dead but ash scoops it up first
he leaps over another set of groping arms that rip from the ground
atop the horse
he glances back in fear to see
the burial site of evil ash
a bolt of lightning strikes the grave marker
is thrust from the ground
a hand breaks the surface of the earth
fly up from the grave and assemble themselves into a lopsided decayed version of evil ash
stares in horror at his evil self
all around skeletons rip from the earth and shriek as they come back to life
kicks the horse and rides off
galloping back the way he came
in the distance we see the cemetery
more bodies arise from the ground
now far from the danger but still he rides hard
im through bein their garbage boy
i did my part of the bargain
he pats the saddlebag where the book is and grins
now they owe me
like in the deal
i want back
he whips his horse
and rides off into the darkness
a tiny figure rides toward the castle
gold tooth and two guards stand atop a tower and shout down to the gatekeeper
open the gates
the promised one has returned
rides across the lowered bridge and into the torchlight of the castle
hold ashs horse as he dismounts
there are excited shouts from the villagers the stranger has returned
hes brought the book
is led to the three wisemen
pours a bucket of water over his head and begins drinking
did you bring the necronomicon
slurps down more of the water averting his eyes from the wiseman
its just that
here ash produces the necronomicon
now send be back
like in the deal
takes the book and suddenly goes pale
i sensed something had gone awry
the books power
murmurs at this bad news
suddenly looks very guilty
wiseman john turns to him
when you removed the necronomicon from its cradle did you speak the words
did you speak the exact words
well maybe not every single syllable no
but basically i said them
bows his head stung by this information
dung eating fool
thou hast doomed us
when thou misspoke the words the army of the dead was awoke
we had a deal
you told me you could clean this thing up once i got you the book
you said there was a passage in there that could get rid of this thing and send me back
the passage is useless to us as long as these evil dead walk
they have a terrible desire for this book
and they shall come here to get it
once in their possession the evil shall rule the earth for one thousand years
because of you
we are doomed
you wanted the damn book
you got yer book
i did my part of the deal
we did strike a bargain
i will return you to your own time as promised
that was the deal
when do you think we can
looks about at the condemned faces
camera pans past the doomed faces in the crowd
when can you send me
sees sheila but looks away consumed with the guilt that hes doomed her
the wisemen were fools to believe that you were the promised one
that one such as you could have saved us
and the others turn away in contempt
i still believe that thou wilt help us
i screwed up
i didnt come through for you and
im sorry for it
i still have faith in thee
in my heart i know thou wilt still succeed
its over for me
i dont belong here and im going home
i didnt have what it took
he bows his head and moves off
a high pitched shriek is heard
look to the sky
possessed women with bat like wings swoop down
scream as they flee from the winged beasts
like a delta winged f it banks towards sheila
races to intercept
he plants himself between sheila and the beast
as it swoops at ash
opens his steel hand then clamps it closed again on the handle of his sword
the immense shadow of the broad winged deadite falls over ash
swings his sword upward
severs the tip of the beasts rotted wing
shrieks in pain as it soars over ash
no longer aerodynamically sound it crashes to the ground
fire their arrows into the beast pegging it to a tree
the bone white eyes of the creature darken
spin to the sound of a womans scream
in the clutches of winged deadite
the beast flies off with the fair maiden soaring over the castle wall and into the distance
shakes his fist at the receding beast
come riding in through the castle doors
an army of the dead
they have gathered in the wilderness and come this way
how far from here
but two days ride
then these winged ones are only the first of them
perhaps we should go from this place while we can
we could be safe in the mountains
to the mountains
we must flee
theyll take our souls
all eyes look to
who stands on a high castle wall clutching his smoldering shotgun
go ahead and run
run home and cry to mama
im through runnin
i stay we stay and fight
takes a challenging step forward
how will we stop an army of the dead at out castle walls
how will you fight that
with more words
most of out people have already fled
we are but forty men
well get henry the red and his men to fight with us
we shall not stand in battle alongside the likes of him
our honor will not allow it
then youll die
honor and all
now whos with me
is silent as they consider ashs words
then from the rear the village blacksmith steps forward
ill stand by you
you may count on my steel
steps forward vowing their allegiance to the cause
reluctantly joins them
directs teams of skeletons to dig at the graves
i want every black hearted worm infested son of a bitch that ever died in battle
well storm their castle and take the book
then my lads eternal life shall by ours
hoist up a stone casket from the ground and with rusted swords pry it open releasing another skeleton who stands to join their ranks
push a bruised sheila to her knees before evil ash
looking up to evil ash in fear
his boney finger comes down into frame and strokes her lovely cheek
she pulls away in revulsion
looks down at her with lust
why aint you a sweet little thing
his boney digit caresses her lips
dont touch me
you foul thing
your gonna learn to live me missy
the promised one will come for you
yanks her to her feet
darlin im gonna save him the trouble
he clutches her squirming body in a boney embrace
silhouetted by the large full moon evil ash forces his kiss upon sheila
around them the skeletons sharpen their swords on tombstones
ash rides toward the castle of henry the red that can be seen in the distance
is suddenly intercepted by four of henrys horsemen
they surround him
he wears the insignia of arthur
the draw their swords when
rides up between his warriors and ash
stay your arms
henry turns to ash
tis the stranger who spared me from the pit
what brings you
the army of the dead
what of them
theyre headed towards arthurs castle
we need your help
fight with us
so you are a vassal of arthur now
you have taken up sides with him against me
the only side im takin is the one thats gonna stop those things
why should i endanger my people to save my enemy
because after they finish with arthur theyll come after you
together weve got a chance
besides you owe me
ride side by side on skeletal steeds
sheila lifts her black veil revealing bone white eyes set into a face now the texture of cracked leather
she looks with admiration to
he is general of the army of deadites
he thrusts a rusted sword into the air and shouts in a gritty voice who rules
raise their swords into the air with a shout
stand atop the castle wall and sound their trumpets
camera pans to reveal
being pulled by a team of men and horses inside the castle walls
ash is behind the steering wheel
look under the hood of the delta parked in the blacksmiths shop
pour molten iron into a large sand mold
is brushed away revealing gear wheels
beat upon red hot iron fashioning helicopter like rotor blades
is lowered into the deltas engine compartment
walks along inspecting a line of forty medieval warriors who stand at attention
he halts before a warrior and stares hard at him
the warrior glances towards ash
you eyeballin me boy
i cant hear you
you squeekin like a mouse
are you a mouse boy
where you from mouse
i hail from the village of perth
only two things come from perth steers and queers
which are you
takes charcoal from a dead fire and chips of dried cow dung
he mixes them with sulfur
is bound up in a small satchel and affixed to an arrow
lights the fuse with a torch
draws back and releases the arrow
imbeds in a wooden post and explodes
large pieces of wood are sent flying
watch in awe
is rung madly
the signal for battle stations
rides in through the castle gates screaming theyre coming
the deadites approach
a look of shock and fear on all the faces
ash comes into frame
camera cranes up with him as he scales the ladder to the lookout tower
he peers out to the darkening horizon
hears them before he sees them the sound of clicking bones
painful moans of tortured souls the clanging of approaching armor
fifty distant silhouettes of the evil dead appear on the horizon
then fifty more
play rotted bagpipes as they march toward the castle
a haunted battle melody
plays the drums upon a set of hollow skulls
takes a leg bone upon a third skeletons ribs
a bone xylophone
a bone o phone
blow into arm bones forming woodwind section
camera tracking with these helmeted skeletons as they march
they are clad in rusting suits of armor wielding swords and spears
nasty grins on their faces
one hobbles past on his wooden leg
ride their steeds to a halt atop a hill
ride alongside evil ash and salute him sharply
we are positioned on both fronts
where are they keeping my book
there in the castles keep
it would be the safest place
it is behind two walls that must be taken first
with a sweep of his arm he waves the army of rot
now pound the attack beat on their drums
advance toward the castle
some crouch behind wooden barricades which they roll before them
pull back arrows on their bow strings
each arrow has a small charge of black powder attached to it
runs behind the archers lighting the fuses on each of the powder charges
as the last arrow is lit
looks to the approaching army
rolls their wooden barricades closer
turns to ash for the signal
holds up a finger
strain their bows taut with the explosive arrows
the sound of the fuse burning is loud
about to disappear into the powder charges
waits one more beat
the turns to arthur
fire a volley of smoking arrows
rain down from the castle wall
are hit with the explosive arrows
are pierced by the explosive arrows
they burst apart in flames
roll on the ground unable to extinguish themselves
continues to advance only to collapse into a smoldering heap
cheer ash in sensurround
races up to ash
a second division approaching from the south
turns to the south
are wheeled into position
hoist large sacks of black powder onto spoons of the catapults
their fuses are lit
swords slice through lines which send giant sacks of black powder catapulting
three flaming projectiles whine as they hurl over the castle walls
camera craning down toward the skeletons as they look upward in horror
the first blast takes out a skeleton horse and rider
four deadites are obliterated
turns to the skeleton captain who rides alongside him
permission to regroup mlord
you neednt bother
slices off the head of skeleton captain
he turns to the mounted deadite next to him
you are now my captain
i will now allow anything to stop me from possessing the necronomicon
get me into that castle
gulps and races forward into the ranks shouting use trees as battering rams and batter the large wooden doors of the castle
begin to buckle beneath the hammering blows
wedge logs to buttress the buckling castle doors
fire a volley of arrows
as they reload
fire their arrows
pierce five warriors atop the castle wall
fall to the courtyard
villagers lift them away on stretchers
shouts to ash where is henry
hell be here
i think he will not
but know this
no matter how this battle fares i was wrong to think you a coward
the battering rams rips through the doors and the army of darkness pours into the courtyard
crawls in with a knife in its teeth
theyre coming in
he turns and runs from the castle entrance dropping his sword and hides in the blacksmiths shop pulling the door closed behind him
shocked at ashs cowardly desertion turns to his men and shouts fall back
man the parapet
protect the book or god save us all
retreat across the courtyard to rope ladders that scale the parapet
the rope ladders are hastily pulled up leaving no access
are stranded in the courtyard
they fight for their lives but are quickly overcome
takes out the last of the stranded warriors with her sword
smiles at sheila
he turns his attention to the guarded tower just beyond the parapet
the book shall be mine
he raises his rusty sword
storm the parapet with three crudely built wooden ladders as large rocks rain down upon them from above
push away ladder
swing away from the wall and crash to the ground
leap onto the parapet and battle the men with swords
knocks the deadite off the ledge and shouts back toward arthur
we cant hold this wall much longer
pierces his armor and he falls to his death
looks up as he hears
through the dust and smoke something appears
an iron beast
its angry iron blades whirling
the stripped chaise of the delta oldsmobile
a steam engine is mounted to its center to power the craft
at the front and rear are spinning helicopter like rotor blades
shovels coal into the deathcoasters furnace
is at the helm
he pulls a cord
screams to announce its birth
is cut to ribbons by swirling blades
at the base of the ladders look up in horror to see
slicing through two deadites at once
the cow catcher in front pushes aside the halved evil dead
operates a crude instrument panel with only two levers to steer the craft
its a bumpy ride
two more skeletons bite the dust
leathery hands pluck a screaming gold tooth from the craft
disappears beneath the squirming corpses
a moment later he re emerges as a skeleton himself except for the single gold tooth that shines against the white of the bone
he stands and joins the deadites
leaps onto the moving deathcoaster to face ash
thou didst find me beautiful once
you got real ugly
attacks with a shriek
spins out his double barreled shot gun and
blows her off the craft
she does a back flip into the other deadites
pulls hard on the steering stick and it tears loose from the craft
careens out of control
tumbles from the helm and hits the ground
flips crushes a group of deadites against a wall and explodes
picks himself up from the dust
he looks upward to
attempts to push the ladder away
a sword comes up into frame stabbing arthur
he is yanked to his death with a shriek
evil ash with his bloody sword leaps up from the ladder and onto the parapet
hes headed for the book of the dead
races to a set of ropes and pulley that ascend the parapet
two deadites come at him
he grabs the rope with his steel hand and slices one end of it with his sword
plummet down atop the two deadites crushing them
simultaneously ash is tanked upward by the rope to the parapet
approaching the necronomicon
kicks aside a hay bale and removes a mini crossbow with four flame tipped arrows loaded and ready
imbeds in evil ashs leg and ignites his body
another flaming dart hits his shoulder blade
the flames consume his body
he burns and shrieks
watches in horror as
revealing a bone white skeleton with mismatched eyes
skeletal evil ash
it races at ash with a shriek
bring their swords together with such great force that sparks fly
ash is forced back against the stone pedestal that holds the necronomicon
with a deft stroke ashs sword is flung from his hand
imbeds in a wooden beam
grabs the necronomicon then swings his sword at ash
grabs a burning iron torch from its mount
man and skeleton battle with flaming torch and sword
the torch is knocked from ashs hand
it falls over the edge of the wall and lands in the courtyard below
it ignites a fuse
the burning fuse leads to a sack of black powder
the sack sits upon the spoon of a catapult
swings his sword
ash leaps over the blade
the skeleton swings downward and ash side steps it
rabbit punches camera
ashs fist bursts out all its rotted teeth
delivers a right hook spinning the skeletons head around in a circle
gives ash a backwards roundhouse kick to the face
ash tumbles over the edge
falls to the courtyard below alongside the catapult
he glances at the burning fuse
leaps from the parapet and lands atop the catapult
the skeleton looks down at ash with a nasty grin of bone
he gestures to the evil dead that overrun the parapet and now battle the last twenty of arthurs warriors for control of the keep
he extends the necronomicon to taunt ash
i possess the necronomicon
ive crushed your pathetic army
now ill have my vengeance
he raises his sword for the death blow
duke henrys men
a jubilant cheer rises from the castle as
thunder down the hill across the drawbridge and into the castle courtyard to attack the deadites
turns back to ash and raises his sword for the kill
has grabbed a sword from a fallen warrior
with a single motion he slices the hand that holds the necronomicon from skeleton ash
snags the book with one hand and on the backswing slices through the rope springing the catapult
are flung over the castle wall
rockets up past camera waving its boney arms
the burning satchel follows
the skeleton is blown to bits in mid air
a cheer goes up within the castle courtyard as henrys warriors crush the last of the deadites
streak over the horizon
ash enters frame
he holds the necronomicon as he looks wearily out over the battlefield
smoking skeletons lay scattered
henry and arthurs warriors work together
they toss the deadite bones and armor into a bonfire
engulfed by flames crack in the heat
are dipped into the flame of a bonfire
form a row of archers
they fire their flaming arrows toward the sea
strike a wooden ship that holds the body of arthur
we said goodbye to arthur
sure we had our problems
but in the end he was all right
watch the funeral pyre sail off
its flickering flames play upon their faces
peace was made between the two peoples
and a new nation was formed
they offered my a chance to stay among them and teach them
a chance to lead them
to be king
but sheila was gone
besides i had places to go
mix a vat of liquid over a fire as they recite a passage from the necronomicon
a flask is dipped into the liquid
hands the flask of liquid to ash
the book tells us that each drop allows a man to sleep a century
swallow six drops and thou shalt awaken in thine own time
ash takes the flask and studies it
but what other choice did i have
i had to find a place to crash
for a very long time
with the aid of his horse drags the deathcoaster inside the cave
he sets the horse free
it gallops off
places a black powder charge at the mouth of the cave
he ignites the fuse and climbs into the car
i locked the door
the powder charge blows
the caves entrance is sealed shut with an avalanche of rock
the car headlights come on piercing the blackness
uncorks the flask filled with the wisemans brew
i closed my eyes
he lets six drops fall into his mouth
one for each century he must sleep
i took a drink
ash is unaware that an extra drop has fallen into his mouth
a th drop
ash swallows the liquid
i didnt know if it was day or night
to get drowsy
and i slept
falls into a deep slumber
now in a different position
time has passed
he needs a shave
wind faster and faster then halt and rust in time lapse photography
the leather band rots away and the watch falls from ashs wrist
rises then sets
forms along the surface of the aging rock wall
dreams last lasted centuries
sprouts buds they swell forming leaves which change to the brilliant colors of fall then drop
on the ceiling of the cave melt
the water drops down onto ashs face
awakens in a heap of rusted scrap which was once the deathcoaster
his clothes and armor having deteriorated he is buck ass naked as he staggers to the mouth of the cave
he digs at the rocks that block the caves entrance
sunlight streams into the hole he has created
climbs from the cave and steps into the sunlight
and when i awoke
after the next nuclear war a dead land
lays sprawled on its side
the time of mankinds death frozen on the cracked face of the clock
abruptly ends a third of the way across a river it once spanned
upon it rest heaps of futuristic yet rusted taxicabs piled eight deep in some places
camera pulls back from a stunned ash amidst the atomized pieces of iron and bone
i found that i had slept too long
is so small a dot now and so far away that we almost cant hear his terrified scream
