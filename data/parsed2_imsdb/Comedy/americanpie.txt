href b b east great falls high by adam herz pan across details in a bedroom
we see discarded shirts
and hear oooh yeah
oh baby youre so good
yeah im the best baby
now we see a tv
but the picture isnt clear
or more appropriately the picture is scrambled it phases in and out
bars scroll across it
and we get occasional glimpses of what looks like oh that was a tit tits
as most high school guys know but few will admit it is possible to watch the pay channels while theyre scrambled
you just need a decent imagination to fill in the rest of the picture
we pull back to see jim short horny
give it to me
oh yeah baby ill give it to you
jim is uh physically involved with the scrambled babe
we tilt down to see a small multimedia presentation next to jim on his bed
cosmopolitan is open to a sexy model
a yearbook is open to the girls swim team section
and a dictionary next to jim open to the vagina listing accompanied by a big vagina diagram
dont you love my sexy body
i do baby i do
he frantically looks around
and grabs a tube sock off the floor
youre so big
yeah thats right
deep macho voice ohhh tell me youre a nasty girl
jim is thrown off
yeahhh you been bad real bad
man shut up
suddenly theres a knock at the door immediately after which jims mom enters
jim scrambles and quickly covers himself and the dictionary with a pillow
shes oblivious to his doings
i just wanted to say sweet dreams
yep okay mom night
leans in to jim kiss goodnight
jim is revolted
very reluctantly he gives her a kiss
she turns to leave and notices the tv
is something wrong with the reception
theres this nature show that im trying to watch
he hurriedly tries to change the channel with the remote but instead the volume goes up
jim panics as his mom reacts shocked
jims dad enters
what the heck is this
i think hes trying to watch one of the illegal channels
theyre not illegal theyre pay channels
how could a television channel be illegal
god get a clue
james dont speak that way to your mother
play with my hairy balls
turn that garbage off
give me that
jims dad grabs for the remote which is sitting on the pillow thats been covering jim
the pillow gets brushed aside revealing the big vagina diagram jim with his shorts down and a very strategically placed tube sock
oh my god
honey why dont you let me handle this one
he ushers her out
jims dad is stuck there with his half naked son
horrible awful embarrassment
a long strained beat
hell son ill buy you some dirty magazines
jims dad exits shaking his head
jim sits agape humiliated
oooh spank me daddy spank me
we see a honda accord drive by a sign at the city limits welcome to east great falls michigan a great place to be the front of the school
kevin drives up in his accord
hes a good humored good enough looking high school senior
vicky rides shotgun pretty smart confident
shes holding a large thick envelope with a big vanderbilt return address on it
its a big thick envelope vicky
you got in
you think so
she tears it open
pulls out a course catalog various forms and a letter which she hands to kevin
were sorry but after keeping you on the wait list for the past couple months weve decided you are now rejected
enclosed is a page full color brochure on how rejected you are
kevin this is serious
you got in
vicky screams in excitement like a girl at a beatles concert
then she laughs and gives kevin a big kiss and hug
i love you
she hugs kevin tighter as he looks a little frazzled almost perfunctorily returning the hug
jim has met up with chris ostreicher oz a cocky senior with a football player build
he cradles a ball in a lacrosse stick
shit if theres any channel that should be illegal its whatever that womens channel is
lifetime supply of pantyhose or some shit
yeah hey did you see the little mermaid on tv the other night
that ariel whew
shes a mermaid dude
trumping him yeah oz but not when shes on land
shes a cartoon dude
is there anything you dont jerk off to
jim and oz now joined by kevin walk down the hall
oz bounces the lacrosse ball off a locker catching it again
kevin speaks a little distantly unnerved
then she said she loves me
oh shit dude the l word
and you said
nothing i just hugged her back
you think she was serious
i couldnt tell she couldve meant like i love you grandma or i love you vanderbilt
just dont bring it up hang low maybe she wont mention it again
the guys pass by a group of band dorks most notable of which is michelle who proudly polishes her flute
and what we should do today in band
instead of playing our instruments regularly
we should play them backwards
thatll be so funny
the band dorks laugh and agree hilariously attempting to play their instruments from the wrong end
the guys shudder
to jim you guys got the latin homework

i figured it out i can get a c minus in every class and its not gonna make a difference

kevin jim and oz are still walking down the hall
paul finch preppy eccentric is sitting on a bench

finch you got the latin homework
canis meus id comedit
the guys keep staring
someone is hollering down the hall
running towards oz is steve stifler very clean cut and preppy hes a maniac a jackass much worse than oz

stifler runs full force into oz grabbing him in a bear hug

oz musters a little laugh
half joking stifler youre such an asshole
meyers whats the deal with you and vicky anyway

do you commonly grasp warm pieces of stool
momentarily puzzled i do when im throwing them at your mom you damn freak
then alright then see you guys tonight
ill look for you in the no fucking section
the guys all take this little too seriously to have a comeback
stifler just laughs obnoxiously as he walks off
kevin is on the phone
hanging near his closet is a tuxedo
intercut with kevins older brother on his cell phone traveling down a california road
you called me to ask me how to get laid
what was i gonna do call dad
i dont even know his number
just dial asshole
yeah well anyway
i thought you might have some advice brother to brother
i mean i think tonight she might we might really theres a chance that you know
have you ever heard of the bible
not the bible
well thats not really the name but we always called it that
does it tell me how to get laid
you know what nevermind
youre not ready
ready for what
whoop youre fading out
good luck at that party
a small nostalgia themed dive
despite the theme classic rock plays
kevin oz jim and finch sit at a table
they munch on hot dogs piled high with condiments
you ever hear of something called the bible
once in church dude
jim is paging through great falls equivalent of the la weekly
ooh heres an easy one attractive swf fun loving and a youthful mind seeks outgoing companion
fun loving insane
unlisted age plus youthful mind equals old
no charming is old
older is really old
youthful mind is dead
perhaps you should consider actually answering an ad
finch you can be the one to date a nearly dead insane chick
eat your damn imitation hot dog
for the hundredth time this is no imitation
removing the hot dog from the ultradog yields a better dog
behold ultradog no dog
finch displays the cross section on his hot dog
its all condiments
the guys react with rehearsed offense
checks his watch alright
im shooting for a nine oclock eta
beer in hand by five after
you can crash at stiflers
its all good
he pulls out some gum breath check
he hands out a stick of gum to each guy automatically skipping finch who pulls out a small hotel bottle of scope
gargles with it
spits it into his drink cup
repulsed dude i wish you wouldnt do that
you got something up your sleeve for tonight finch
a foolproof plan my friend
you shall see
oz has tuned into the song in the background blinded by the light the original springsteen version not the manfred mann remake
sings along and little hurly burly came by in her curly wurly and asked me if i needed i ri hide how the hell do you know all these random
its early springsteen dude this is classic
this was before the cheesy remake
this was remade
chiming in as the chorus hits bli hinded by the light cut loose like a deuce another runner in the night blinded
at least now i know what the hell theyre saying
so does my hair look better flips a small lock of hair onto his forehead like this or
flips it back up like this
nadia does that czechoslovakian chick she might be there tonight
now do you think shed prefer flips hair down again cool hip jim
flips it back up or laid back jim
the difference is so phenomenal i cant decide
they exit the restaurant
what about you
youre the one with the girlfriend and youre still stranded on third base
you know ive never got that shit
what exactly constitutes third base
holds up a couple fingers contact dude
then where does a blowjob figure in
they ponder this for a moment
course you dont make it to third and youre out
so lets say you get there
whats uh third base feel like
oh man thats kind of sad
jim shrugs embarrassed
feels like warm apple pie dude
then mcdonalds or homemade
they just look at him
finch hops on his scooter
gentlemen see you at the bacchanalia
he meeps his horn and buzzes away
for a high school party its pretty good
the house is peppered with all types of high school students
music blends with the din of excited conversation
kevin and jim are drinking beers
around them students mingle and flirt
chuck sherman comes up
whats up fellas
scopin the babes
some fine ladies here boys
confidence is high repeat confidence is high
sherman is moving to defcon two full strategic arsenal ready for deployment
youve got something going
did you see that central chick
seems that shes taken a liking to me
fellas its time that she experienced the sherminator
yeah okay sherman whatever
im a sophisticated sex robot sent back through time
to change the future for one lucky lady
yeah man right on
sherman saunters off into the party
shakes his head hopeless
vicky approaches having a good time joining the guys exchanging greetings
jim spots nadia across the room
shes beautiful a masterpiece of a woman
there she is
you like her
her sponsor family lives on my block
why dont you talk to her
what would i say
just tell her whats on your mind
and smile youve got a good smile
then to kevin come on
to jim gotta go
but kevin and vicky disappear into the crowd just as jim sees nadia approaching him
jim contd kevin get back here
but hes gone
and nadia is now in front of him
with no other alternative jim readies himself smiling big
with a really sexy accent you are in my english class no
i thought so
jims smile grows even bigger almost stupid
nadia contd so you are having fun
jim nods still smiling away
staring right through her head
nadia contd i said you are having fun
a little squeak escapes his throat
jim is on mental vacation
nadia contd me too
jims expression is now plasticized
a frozen completely artificial smile
nadia is confused
nadia contd well
i am going to get another beer
you want one
jim strains to speak through his smile
she walks off
jim sighs completely relaxing like a huge burden is now off of him
he wipes his brow
then realizing oh shit
he pounds his head with his fist
a group of band dorks is on the porch including michelle
stifler stands in the doorway staring at them in disbelief
were here for the party
theres no party
music blares from inside
a drunken hand reaches through the door and ruffles stiflers hair
the hand disappears back into the house
try the house down the street
stifler slams the door
the dorks wait a moment
ring the bell again
ringing the bell is dorky lets just go in
we hear a click of a deadbolt
kevin and vicky are on the bed making out
vicky do you think maybe
its time for us to take the next step in our relationship
yeah its such a perfect evening
isnt this how youve always pictured it
yelling dude my farts fuckin stink
you reek like a fuckin yeti dude
go take a shit or something
kevin and vicky exchange a glance
vicky pushes him onto his back
oz is in the passenger seat making out with the aforementioned college chick
shes attractive and older looking from a high school perspective
they are parked near the river that flows through downtown great falls
great evening isnt it
theres something about the spring thats just cool
like the smell of fresh rain or something
at this she snuggles up to him
oz smiles confidently
suck me beautiful
the college chick backs off confounded
what did you just say
not so confidently suck me
the college chicks eyes flutter in disbelief
she tries to keep her cool but can barely restrain her laughter
oz attempts to maintain a suave exterior but hes just had the rug pulled from under him
you know my friends call me nova as in casanova
you need some work buddy
she bursts into laughter
oz is ill
jeez dont laugh at me
seeing ozs defeated expression she collects herself
there are just some things you need to learn thats all
she sees that hes lost
almost feels sorry for him
youve got to tone it down
you dont need to go to lookout point and spout cheeseball lines to be romantic
you have to pay attention to a girl
be sensitive to her feelings
relationships are reciprocal
im not good in math
shes trying not to laugh again
come on ill drop you off at your friends
oz couldnt be humiliated any further
oz is nursing a beer having just told the story to jim stifler and some guys
hysterical toppling over you actually said that
shut the fuck up
hey you did better than i did nova
oh thats really reassuring
and dont call me nova anymore
im a fraud
this is pathetic
im gonna find me a little hottie
stifler strides into another room
contd yelling suck me beautiful
oz wallows in his beer can beaten
vicky is pleasuring kevin
brief pause let me know
okay dont stop
a moment more and then kevin is about to lose it
kevin contd oh now
with awkward hurriedness vicky stops as kevin frantically searches for a receptacle
he grabs a nearby cup of beer
insert a hand pumping up the keg
a fresh beer foams out into the cup
there we go
vicky is buttoning up her shirt
kevin tentatively sets down the beer and buttons his pants
suddenly the door bursts open
stifler is standing there
a coat hanger sticks out of the doorknob
god dammit stifler
check out time
please vacate the room
stifler youre such a jerk
she runs out grabbing her clothes
kevin runs after her
stifler enters the bedroom laughing pulling a sophomore chick behind him
he closes the door
god i cant believe there are so many cool people at this party
and you got a keg too wow
realizing oh wait i left my beer downstairs
stifler notices kevins beer sitting on the night table
he hands it to her
shes about to take a sip
gazing into her eyes youre really beautiful
thrown off she sets the beer down
shes totally enthralled
nervous she raises the beer again to take a sip
then stifler moves in
takes the beer from her and sets it down
starts kissing her
she breaks it off
i dont know if i want to be doing this
sighs doing what
stifler looks inconvenienced
he picks up the beer annoyed
if we hook up tomorrow ill just be some girl you go telling all your friends about
shifty no way
avoiding her look he raises the beer to take a sip
a little angry steve
you could at least look at me when you say that
stifler stops and sighs the beer inches from his mouth
stares her in the eye
searching remembers sarah
i wouldnt go telling stories or whatever about you
smiling he raises the beer
jim and some other guys are pounding shots of vodka
what the hell
i should be able to talk to chicks
i got a on my sat verbal
starts listing off words copious
a guy screams upstairs
a girl screams upstairs
the sophomore chick comes running through the kitchen
and indeterminate stain is on her shirt
she bolts out the door and into the night
a moment passes
stifler is on his knees barfing in the toilet
jim and a few other guys rush in
jesus what did you eat
stifler just keeps hurling
kevin enters holding the remains of the tainted beer
stifler hows the man chowder
stifler barfs even more violently
jessica and vicky are refilling their beers at the keg
nadia waits patiently beside them with an empty cup
he likes it
of course he does
what about you
have you just never had one with kevin or have you never had one period
i think ive had one
well thats a no
no wonder youre not psyched about sex
starts filling vickys beer youve never even had one manually
ive never tried it
are you kidding
youve never double clicked your mouse
hell just a pair of tight pants will set me off
noticing nadia next to them she passes the tap along am i right or what nadia
no bones about it you are right
the hands are not always necessary
to vicky see
in fact i should teach you my own special method
i developed it myself at the ballet institute in prague
you use nothing but the muscles of the inner thigh
nadia walks off
no wonder she never pays attention in class
vicky nods traumatized
kevin and jim are looking at a picture of stiflers mom on the wall
very attractive late s
shit i cant believe a fine woman like this produced a guy like stifler
two freshman guys are walking by as jim says this
that chick is a milf
what the hell is that
m i l f
mom id like to fuck
suddenly a bedroom door opens a couple inches
sherman pokes his head out
hushed to guys dont you think you fellas could try a little tact
ive got company
know what i mean
in the bedroom in the background we see the central girl
sherman closes the door leaving the guys there dumbstruck
jim and kevin are coming down the stairs
if sherman has sex before i do im gonna be really fucking pissed
they turn the corner into the kitchen
man i just gotta get laid already
this blowjob thing is bullshit
vicky is there with jessica
staring at him
vicky quietly grabs her purse
other students watch silently
kevin doesnt know what to say
jessica can you drive me home
the guys watch as the girls head for the door
not for you
the girls exit
nobody says anything
kevin is in shock
i am the yeti
the next morning
the party is long over
plastic beer cups and various bottles litter the house but its not trashed
jim is wandering around in a daze holding his head
he stumbles over a body
ow what the hell
sorry i thought you were dead
they walk over to the other side of the room
finch is sitting on the couch
good morning gentleman
where were you last night
what happened to the foolproof plan
i thought a fashionably late entrance would enhance my appearance
off their looks when i got here the bacchanalia was over and the nymphs had left
oz wanders in still sullen
takes a seat sulking
feeling better oz
im such a loser
thats the spirit
we hear footsteps coming down the stairs
its the central girl
she wears a central sweatshirt
sherman follows behind her
the guys watch in disbelief as sherman and the girl speak hushed intimately
snippets of conversation ill never forget
the central girl smiles
notices the other guys watching
just gives sherman a kiss on the cheek
the guys are dumbfounded
sherman looks triumphant
strides over to the guys
you did it
fellas say goodbye to chuck sherman the boy
i am now a man
the guys are shocked and amazed
i highly recommend you join the club
i i dont get it how the hell did you do that
it was just my time fellas it was just my time
best of luck to you boys
the guys look like they just lost the world series on errors
they slowly take seats ruined
i put in months of quality time with vicky
sherman meets a chick for one night and scores
this is just wrong
no shit im never gonna get laid
how the hell am i gonna become this mr
jesus were all gonna go to college as virgins
theyve probably got special dorms for people like us
a long beat as they give this serious consideration
then kevin strides purposefully to the front of the group
alright i got an idea
but it stays between us
kevin contd okay
its really simple
we make an agreement no wait more than an agreement
like a bet
no a pact no money involved
this is more important than any bet
now heres the deal we all get laid before we graduate
a beat dude its not like i havent been trying to get laid
this is different
this is better
think of when youre working out oz
you need a partner someone to spot you
someone to keep you motivated
oz nods getting into it
kevin smiles and continues arms outspread
thats what we are we keep each other on track
prior to this day weve postured
weve well i cant think of other p words but weve probably done them too
ignoring him separately we are flawed and vulnerable
but together we are the masters of our sexual destiny
kung fu voice their tiger style kung fu is strong but our dragon style will defeat it
going on the sha lin masters from east and west must unite
guys guys youre ruining my fucking moment here
now think about it kevin jumps up on a chair
no longer will our penises remain flaccid and unused
from now on we fight for every man out there who isnt getting laid when he should be
this is our day
this is our time
and by god were not gonna let history condemn us to celibacy
we will make a stand
we will succeed
we will get laid kevin jumps down off the chair and puts his hand out in front of him
one by one the guys pile their hands on top in between them its a pact
they break with a cheer
wandering down from upstairs what the hell are you losers doing
they all stop
stifler has a toothbrush hanging from his mouth
a goatee of dried toothpaste
if i might ask when you brush your teeth do you spit or swallow
stifler tries to give a retort to finch but turns green and heads back upstairs
the guys are finishing up breakfast
hot dogs eggs
now the sex its got to be valid consensual sex
no funny stuff
and no prostitutes if you were thinking about that finch
finch gives a wistful who me
so im thinking prom is basically our last big chance
dude prom sucks
i know but think about it at the parties that night
chicks are gonna want to do it
yeah its like tradition or something
that gives us
exactly three weeks to the day
they take this in with some trepidation
there are none
kevin raises his pepsi
kevin contd to the next step
the guys raise their drinks
to the next step
and from this we go into our strategizing jim sits in the room as kevin goes through the yellow pages
finds a floral delivery listing
kevin jim and oz are pooling a few dollars together which kevin takes
they part ways
oz is watching the lifetime channel as jim looks on in confusion
a martha stewart type thing where they pain pottery with little sponges
oz looks dubious
finch is unpacking his lunch
he carefully unfolds a napkin to reveal a sandwich crust removed
other than that hes doing absolutely nothing
jim is fiddling with a small golfball like camera attached to his computer
the computer screen reads e date we make love happen
as jim fiddles with the camera a window on the screen shows his real time image
he clicks an onscreen button labeled freeze image the image freezes showing jim with an awkward grimace
the screen reads image sent
kevin holds a copy of the holy bible
we see hes in the religion section
surrounded by piles of different bibles
finch pulls out a small mustard packet
he neatly snips the end with scissors
then rolls the packet like a tube of toothpaste economically dispensing every last bit of mustard
jim is on his computer
the screen reads you have replies
jim is nonplussed
kevin oz and jim are closely gathered around kevins locker holding their backpacks open
kevin holds a big shopping bag which he turns over and a box of condoms falls out
he hands it over to jim
and we see that the guys packs are full of various condom boxes
jim has unraveled a bunch of condoms and is curiously examining them
and the montage comes to an abrupt end with a knocking
shoving the rubbers into his night table just a minute
he opens the bedroom door
jims dad is standing there
trying not to look inside can i come in
dad come in
jims dad reluctantly enters carrying a brown paper bag
he takes a seat on jims bed
fatherly attempt sit down jim
jim takes a seat next to his dad
these are for you
from father to son
jim looks at the bag
hesitantly he takes it
slowly dreadfully he pulls out a copy of uh
jims dad is doing his best to be the good father
go ahead son theres more
beyond embarrassed jim reaches into the bag
pulls out a penthouse
jims dad contd now that ones a little more
a little more
i know dad
heres let me show you
jims dad takes the bag back
pulls out a copy of jims dad contd this son is your more exotic dirty magazine
do you know about the clitoris
through clenched teeth yes dad
sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate
interrupting hand up thank you dad i got it
okay well that about covers it
jim murmurs something incomprehensible
jims dad contd now lets put these somewhere where your mother wont find them
jims dad takes the stack of magazines
he goes to open jims night table
but its too late
jims dad is face to face with the unraveled prophylactics
beaten ill have to save this speech for another day
im too worn out
jims dad exits a condom stuck to the back of his pants
kevin is trying to talk to vicky
did you get the flowers
no response what about the poem
she doesnt care
kevin contd vicky please dont do this
vicky stares him right in the eye
ill think about it
she slams her locker and walks off
jessica is nearby
ah youll get her back soon enough
thats easy she likes you
what you need to do is learn to press a girls buttons
you gotta give her what shes never had
ill give you a hint
hot orgasmic ohhh yeah yeah
you got it stud
im pretty sure ive interrupts authoritatively no you havent
but that one time shaking head no
well of course id want to give her that
i mean what do you think i dont care about her
do you love her
i i dont know you cant ask me that
well if you want to get her in the sack tell her you love her
thats how i was duped
i dont want to dupe her jessica
if i say it i have to be sure i mean it
well its up to you
the big l or the big o
suddenly stifler comes running up breathless
you gotta see this
the vocal jazz group is practicing singing one of those doo wop acapella love songs i
love you like i do
singing with the group is none other than oz
hes not doing too badly but mainly hes checking out the various vocal jazz girls
smiling at them giving suave little waves
kevin stifler and jim take seats in the back of the auditorium listening
this is unexpected
what did you cocks do to him
shit if coach marshall sees this hell kick oz off the team on principle alone
the song finishes
oz bounds up to the other guys
hey guys you came to watch me in action
yeah i think you sounded pretty good
i think you need your balls reattached
keep it down dude
what the fuck are you doing here
this place is an untapped resource
check it out dude these vocal jazz girls are hot a few of the girls are gathering their stuff one of whom is heather conservative looking cute
hey weve got conan the barbarian singing with us
maybe hell crush some beer cans on his forehead
i think hes got a nice voice
ribbing her go talk to him maybe you can teach him how to read
heather shakes her head
back to you dipshit youre expecting to score with some goody goody choir girl priss
dude watch me work
they go for sensitive studs like me
oz waves goodbye to a final choir girl
finch is sitting on a bench reading the paper carefree
kevin and jim approach
this is your plan finch
he turns a page
skims the articles
youre just gonna sit there and drink your coffee
then actually in the spirit of the pact i do need to ask for your cooperation in one small matter
of course finch
whatever you hear about me you agree
what are we gonna hear
sixteen minute round trip
finch dont you think its about time you learned to take a dump at school
when was the last time you looked at the facilities here
fifteen minutes ago
finch shudders and walks away
kevin and jim stand there dumbfounded
an enthralled girl approaches
was that paul finch
you guys have like seen him in the locker room right
is it true that hes really
i have no idea
finch showers in a bathing suit
forced no its true
loving it yeah enormous
does he have a date for prom yet
no way she hurries off to a group of girls sharing the gossip
they all seem very interested
dumbfounded finch hasnt done a damn thing and hes got girls lining up already
kevin is on the phone
say that again kevin
i thought you might know a trick or something
to make her you know
kevins brother is on his cell phone
a sushi chef prepares food behind the counter
the sushi chef looks up
kevins brother turns away
to kevins brother whats good here
try the spicy tuna hand roll
how do i do that
uh forget that
look is that all youre interested in
ways to get your girlfriend into bed
i guess it would be good to be able to return the favor
i mean it would be nice to know she enjoys things as much as i do
thats good thats what i needed to hear
now you qualify
qualify for what
youve just inherited the bible
kevin is walking through the religion section
he carefully looks about making sure nobodys watching
it originally started as a sex manual this book that some guys brought back from amsterdam in the early eighties
what to do with your tongue things like that
and each year it got passed on to one east student who was worthy of it
kevin kneels down on the floor near a section of various bibles on the bottom shelf
kevins brother v
contd after a couple years guys started adding their own techniques
things they figured out themselves
kevin slides out the section of bibles from the bottom shelf
pulls out a pocket knife
flips up the bottom of the shelf
slides it out
kevins brother v
contd you have to keep it a secret and return it at the end of the year
so now you know
there a bit dusty is an old book
many extra pages of notebook paper have been tucked into it nearly breaking the binding
the original title is now obscured over it someone has written the bible
remember when indian jones found that gold statue
its like that right now
kevin carefully pulls it out
reverently flips through it
full of details
and atop each handwritten page is a year indicating the date it was added
kevin reaches the last page
he lightly runs his hand down the empty page
jim enters his house slinging his backpack off his shoulder
jim walks into the kitchen noticing a fresh baked pie on the counter
next to it is a note jimmy apple your favorite
ill be home late
jim sniffs the pie taking in the aroma
as a quizzical look spreads across his face
after a moment of thought he slides a finger into the pie
moves it around a bit studying the consistency
then jim becomes more curious
we can see the gears in his head start to turn
he looks down at the pie like its
well not a pie
jims dad gets out of his car carrying his briefcase
jims dad comes in the door and stops dead in his tracks
his face drops appalled
its not what it looks like
jim and his dad sit in silence opposite each other at the table
jim stares into his lap humiliated
jims dad is crushed
youve never seen such disappointment
but hes trying to keep his chin up for jims sake
in the middle of the table is the pie
mushed up ruined
fighting back tears i guess
well just tell your mother
that we ate it all
kevin sits on his bed reading a book the bible
if all students studied the way kevins studying this book wed have a nation of geniuses
hes scrutinizing it
turning it sideways and upside down as if trying to decipher cave paintings
the vocal jazz group is doing a song
oz is singing along really making it look like hes into it
he closes his eyes singing with even more enthusiasm
as the song ends oz continues just a moment more with his shtick a little heartfelt vocal scat to tag the number
the thing is it actually sounds really good
oz opens his eyes
to see the whole group especially the girls looking at him somewhat awed
the choir teacher is a smartly dressed black woman
what the hell was that
no it was good
noticing heather looking at him he acts sensitive it came from the heart
well then keep it coming
to everyone alright people good work
keep it up and well do great at the state competition
rehearsal wraps up and heather comes up to oz
not bad chris
surprised himself really
hey thanks heather right
youve got this sort of
bobby mcferrin thing going there
no idea yeah
right uh huh
then back into it i feel like ive discovered this whole new side of me
music is so expressive
then i mean i agree but
arent you supposed to be out like trying to decapitate someone with your lacrosse stick or something
oz gets serious at this
i know what people think
its like oz hes just this kickass lacrosse player i also play football by the way but thats like
not all that i am
of course i didnt cutting her off i mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that
sparking to this you
you think i dont get that
god its like just because i dont get drunk and barf every weekend people say oh heres this goody two shoes choir girl priss
of course this is what stifler said about her
and for a moment this catches oz off guard
so like what else do you do
offended well the same things you do
hang out with friends and stuff you know whatever
then what do you think i do
genuine i just realized that i didnt know anything about you
i was interested
well thats okay
kevin is walking home with vicky
hes a couple paces behind her almost tagging along
i was being selfish
and majorly insensitive
and im a total idiot
i think shithead really says it
im a shithead
im a complete and total shithead
she cracks a little smile
and i want to try to make it up to you
vicky stops walking
looks at kevin
vickys perfect suburban home
as we hear vicky moaning oh
your parents are downstairs
tight on vickys face in sexual bliss writhing
oh kevin dont stop
just a second
we see that kevin is kneeling on the floor
vickys legs are to both sides of him hes ducking down consulting the bible which is hidden beneath the bed
its open to a page titled the tongue tornado
kevin resumes out of frame
vicky goes nuts
vicky contd a little too loudly oh god
vicky reaches blindly for a pillow
she squeezes it over her face moaning into it
vicky contd moly shmmmt
noticing that vicky now cant see him kevin cautiously pulls out the bible from under the bed
sets it next to her
he constantly refers from the book to vicky and back again
vickys mom is straining some pasta
on the fridge we see a collage in tribute to vicky her senior portrait national honor society certificate a report card
yells to vickys dad hon
can you tell vick to come on down for supper
vickys dad is at the table reading the paper
he gets up with a grunt
vicky can barely control herself
she screams into the pillow
vicky shhh you know theres no lock on your door
vickys dad is trudging up the stairs
vicky wrestles with her own ecstacy
kevin keeps referencing the bible
whatever hes doing its working
vickys dad approaches the bedroom door
vicky is about to explode
she pulls the pillow off her face gasping
vickys dad reaches for the doorknob
vickys dad shrugs turns around and heads back downstairs
jims door opens
reverse to see jims dad looking at the family portrait of jims family in the hallway outside jims room his back turned to jims door
did you knock
jims dad continues to study the picture
then he turns around like he just realized the door was open
im looking at the ol family portrait here
its a good one
jim can only shrugs in response
he goes into the hall and looks at the portrait
son i wanted to talk to you about what i think you were trying to do the other day
jims face drops seeing his death unfold
continuing with his prepared speech now you may have tried it in the shower or maybe in bed at night and not even known what you were doing
or perhaps youve heard your friends talking about it in the locker room
jims eyes dart about looking for a place to hide
dad please stop
im sure i know what youre talking about
sure you know son but i think youve been having a little problem with it
its okay though
what youre doing is perfectly normal
its like practice
like when you play tennis against a wall
some day therell be a partner returning the ball
a beat you do want a partner dont you son
through clenched teeth yes
now remember its okay to play with yourself
or as i always called it elbows jim stroke the salami
chuckles ho ho jim
theres nothing to be ashamed of
hell im fifty two and i still enjoy masturbating
uncle mort masturbates
we all masturbate
nauseated and entirely disoriented jim tries to stumble back into his room
he smacks the doorframe
keeps going slamming the door behind him
jims dad contd poor guy thought he was the only one
the football field also doubles as the lacrosse field
east great falls is battling central
its a rough game muddy brutal
we see oz grunting and groaning playing very tough
on the sidelines we see heather has shown up
shes watching the game and is impressed as she watches ozs agility and domination
oz runs up the field cradling the ball in his stick
a couple central players try to check him
heather cringes with each impact and is then excited to see oz dodge his opponents
finally oz scores with a triumphant yell
heather cheers with the crowd as the egf players congratulate each other
after the game
oz sees heather waiting for him on the sidelines
hes about to run over when coach marshall snags him good work ostreicher
youre a killer ozzy
trying to get away thanks coach follow with oz as he trots over to heather covered in mud
hey whatre you doing here
just enjoying my exhilarating first lacrosse experience
you like kicked butt
a clod of mud falls from ozs uniform onto heathers skirt
brushing it off her skirt whoops excuse me
oz wipes the mud from his hands
heather has something to say thats not quite coming out
chris you can call me oz
do i have to
you can call me ostreicher
whats your middle name
i wont tell
neither will i
pause so i had this
this may seem like its out of left field and i dont know if you can but since im not going with anyone before she can finish stifler runs up
sweaty and excited
noticing heather choir chick
what the hell are you doing here
well i uh i was decides to stand her ground i was asking chris to prom
turns to oz so do you wanna go
oz is surprised at her directness
yeah well just dont expect oz to pay for the limo
stifler fuck noticing heather sensitive man you dont have to be so insensitive
what he dismisses it whatever look uh dont forget my cottage after prom
on lake michigan
stifler joins some other lacrosse buddies
i gotta hit the showers but
i think thisll be really good
yeah me too okay cool
they share a smile
then heather walks off towards her car
oz trots off to stifler and the other lacrosse guys
my man oz working it with the choir babes
cheering slapping him yeah go oz
oz laughs embarrassed
pandering to them hey you know what can i say i dig those cute little sweaters she wears
ill bet you do you little horndog shes givin you fuckin stiffies right
stifler goes into what can only be described as the spank me and fuck me like a whore dance
sing for me
the other guys laugh
oz joins in laughing in spite of himself
they all high five
and from the other side of the field we see heather peering over at them
hardly believing it as oz joins in the laughter
the teacher is wrapping up a lecture
so once hal becomes king he has to take on the responsibilities of leadership and turn his back on his old drunken friend falstaff
you see hal was going through a rite of passage much like you all are
make the most of the time youve got left together
youll miss it later
jim kevin and oz sit in the back of the classroom in one corner
so does your tongue cramp up
nah you get kind of dizzy though
wow thats amazing shes probably gonna want to do it soon
kevin shrugs as the bell rings
sherman passes by
still questing after the holy grail eh guys
he chuckles and exits
the guys stand up exiting the classroom
hey wheres finch
went home to shit
i dont get it
how does a guy like that get this sudden reputation
he taps a passing random cute girl on the shoulder
kevin contd excuse me
do you know who paul finch is
have you guys seen his tattoo
is it cool
i heard it was like an eagle blazing in fire and stuff
nods loving it actually its an eagle and this big python
yeah see its on his stomach here and the eagle the eagle is actually grasping the python in its talons so the snake is like his interrupting thats good jim
woah no way
that guy is so cool
she hurries off to tell her friends
the guys exit the classroom
i cant i have no idea how hes doing it
and that leaves you trailing jim
you gotta get your act together
a little aggravated yeah i know
im working on it
jim turns around to find nadia is standing right in front of him
jim says nothing
oz elbows him
jim gives a startled grunt
you are very good in the world history class yes
jim looks over to kevin and oz who excitedly give him encouraging looks and gestures
trying to decipher the guys signals yes
perhaps you can help me with my studies
the guys nod yes
that would be cool sometime
sees the guys gesticulating how bout tomorrow
well i do have ballet practice
perhaps i can come by your house afterwards
i can change clothes at your place
barely overwhelmed i suppose that would be okay
nadia walks off
jim collapses into ozs and kevins arms like a marathon runner at the end of a race
they pat him heartily in congratulations
oz is there as heather pulls up in a new saab
im glad you think so
you dont like it
no i like the car
then direct by the way though about prom
that was like a bad idea
sorry i invited you
she hastily walks towards the school
i asked you because i thought you might actually be worth going with
but you are just a jock
youre a jerk
no im not
i saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies
i wasnt making fun of you
give me a break youre so full of it
she hurries up more breaking off from oz and enters the school
after a moment he slowly heads in
oz and heather are singing with the group at opposite ends of the room
its a pop contemporary arrangement of how sweet it is
it sounds jazzy cool
oz looks dazed like the winds taken out of him
he sings along distant
heather almost defiantly sings clearer and better than ever
oz watches her though she never looks his way
at the bride of the song heather breaks into a solo
she sings beautifully
oz is hooked
the choir teacher halts the song
okay heather that was good but i want to thicken up that solo
michigan state is this saturday and i want that part to smoke i know my timings off
a little but i think itll work better as a duet
with a tenor part
interrupting ill do it
a beat as the choir teacher is impressed and heather looks indifferent
ill do it
the rest of you okay with that
the rest of the choir agrees as heather looks to oz with skepticism
see you tomorrow
the group starts packing up
annoyed why are you doing this
because i want to
well you cant fake your way through this
you better practice
jim kevin oz and stifler
youre gonna have a naked eastern european chick in your house and youre telling me youre not gonna take advantage of that
what am i gonna do broadcast her over the internet
you can do that
off their looks oh no way
i cant do that to her
dammit jim get some fucking balls
if you dont have the guts to photograph a naked chick in your room how are you ever gonna sleep with one
now all you gotta do is set up some sort of private link or whatever on the net and tell me the address
the guys ponder this
you can send me the address too
dammit if im doing this how the hell am i gonna watch
ill save you a seat
jim is setting the computer camera on top of the monitor
the computer bings
you have established an internet connection
types a quick e mail
it reads oh yeah
jim scrolls through his list of e mail addresses
highlights a listing
kevin and finch sit in front of a computer
kevin is unloading beer and chips from a grocery bag
we see an image of jims bedroom on the computer screen
its a little strobed but easily watchable
suddenly jims face pops into frame
hes adjusting the camera
there we go
we see the same image on jims screen
jim turns off just the monitor
it looks like the computer is off the ruse is undetectable
jims dad enters with nadia
shes in sweats and a leotard carrying a duffel bag over her shoulder
jims dad is delighted fidgety almost giddy
this ladys here for you
like its no big deal i know
ready to study
oh you bet he is
jims quite the bookworm
oh no not too much of a bookworm
hes a good little kid
ill let you hit those books
jims dad gives a knowing look and exits
stiflers younger brother a monster is tugging at stifler who sits at the computer watching jims room
its my computer and wanna use it
shut up and watch this you might learn something
so you need to change right
do you mind
this fabric is so uncomfortable
she sets her duffel on jims bed
no go right ahead and get dressed
ill just be downstairs studying up
get me when youre ready
jim exits closing the door behind him
here we go
jim sprints down the hall
thunders down the stairs
jims mom and dad are sitting downstairs
jim bolts through the room
be back in a sec
he practically crashes through the door on his way out
honey where are you going
she turns and looks at her husband
jim runs like hell
nadia unzips her duffel pulling some clothes out
jim trucks across the lawn to the door
kevin and finch are watching the computer screen
want a beer
finch simply waves off the question
hes glued to the screen
jim bursts into the room breathless
did i miss anything
just in time
jim grabs a seat by the computer
all three guys watch transfixed
nadia is slipping out of her leotard
nadias leotard is off
bra and panties
intercut between jims bedroom and the guys around the computer screen in kevins bedroom
looks in jims full length mirror
admiring her body
this is incredible
nadia peels off her sportsbra
the guys are awestruck
i cant believe oz had to work
oz sits alone in the empty vocal jazz rehearsal area
he sighs leafing through some sheet music
its as quiet and boring as can be
stifler and his brother are awestruck
this is like the coolest thing ive ever seen
oh thank you lord for this wonderful day
nadia still primps in the mirror
then she looks around
very carefully she pokes through the stuff on jims night table
jim contd hey
you cant touch my stuff
nadia opens the night table
nadia delicately reaches into the night table as jim crumbles
jim contd oh no no no
she pulls out the stack of porno magazines
nice collection there jim
nadia takes a penthouse
starts thumbing through it
she sits on jims bed
lingering on some pages
dear god shes shes shes welcome to every mans fantasy
nadias hand wanders into her panties
jim contd gentlemen id like to make an announcement
there is a gorgeous woman masturbating on my bed
the guys watch completely blown away
nadias lost herself
you know jim
you could go back there
nodding seduce her
but but what would i do
just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something
no youre stupid
he bolts across the room
jim sprints across the lawn
jim leaps over a row of bushes
gets up and keeps running
jim crashes into the house and runs past his bewildered parents
hey mom hey dad
he rushes up the stairs
jims dad looks hopeful
jim stops outside his door catching his breath
he can hear faint moaning from inside
oh boy oh god oh crap oh no
come on jim
where are you
the phone rings
kevin contd into phone hello
how did you know
sherman sits in front of a computer
into phone jim mustve addressed that e mail wrong
it went out to every mailbox in the east high directory
god how juvenile
a computer nerd is at his computer
a group of stoners log onto the page
a little monkey hops around in a cage
jim still waits outside his bedroom door
takes a deep breath
looks upwards to the sky
let this be it
hes going in
we see a bedroom full of guys
theres somebody going in there
hey that guys in my trig class
jim stands there bewildered
nadia hasnt noticed him eyes closed still pleasuring herself
jim stands there watching faltering
gathers his courage
finally he rolls his eyes and says looks like you could use an extra hand
nadias eyes flash open
you have come in here on purpose
shame on you
you have seen me
now it is my turn to see you
jim sneaks a nervous glance over to the quickcam
you mean like strip strip
irresistably sexy for me
what do you suppose theyre saying
nadia leans over to jims clock radio
turns it on
we hear country music
she flips the dial and we hear a few stations flip by
then a driving euro techno song
she turns to jim
move with the music
he struts clumsily back and forth
takes his shirt off
swings it in a circle around his head
and lets go of it aiming for the quickcam where it lands
no no you must put your whole body into it
nadia i cant cant what
do you not want to be with me
i wish to be entertained james
jim nods eagerly
concentrates on the music
as we see the shirt slide off the camera
jim starts writhing to the beat
like a hyperactive chicken
what the fuck is this
the horror the horror
jim is into it now
possibly the worst dancer in the world
god what a buzzkill
a group of girls watches in amusement
work it baby
the laugh and dance mockingly along with jim
jim tugs off his pants dancing and tripping on them
turned on more sexy jim more sexy
jim is clearly excited by nadias prodding
he does some pathetically ridiculous move with his pants sliding them around his chest and neck
a group of girls is watching
hes no paul finch
kevin and finch are now completely sickened
this is truly revolting
jim is straddled over a chair grinding against the chair back in his boxers and shorts
getting really turned on more more you bad boy
jim starts spanking his ass as he gyrates
the guys are all trying not to watch yet still drawn to the computer
hames come to me
jim dances over to her
she pulls him onto the bed
kisses his neck
takes his hand
places it on her thigh
ho lee shit
this just got a hell of a lot better
jims hand wanders up nadias leg
she does the same to him
blows in his ear
her hand is about to enter his shorts
and jim is done
he looks down at himself in terror
the stoners look
the girls are laughing hysterically
he blew it
nadia is getting dressed
you are done james
perhaps i should be going now
no no im not done
ive got reserves
nadia please please please
im begging you
she sees the desperation in his eyes
thinks about it
i do like your dirty magazines
jim digs into the stack of pornos
did you see this
this is your more exotic dirty magazine
james it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me
very arousing women
they arouse me very much
but not as arousing as you
she goes for this line
she grabs him
starts caressing his body
hes re engaging
a cheer goes up as the guys celebrate
theyre tangled in each other
nadia backs off for a moment
slowly teasing she hooks her thumbs in the sides of her panties
starts sliding them down
so shaved is the expression
close up on jim as his eyes bug out
yep it is and she is
mutters holy shit
unison jim is stuck
staring at nadia
she moves towards him
nadia is inches from his face
touch me jim
jim is trembling straining with himself
a shudder runs through him
and its over again
the girls are laughing again
no not again
sighs i am sorry jim
i suppose we will not be doing any studying now
nadia starts getting dressed
jim is whimpering
it is too bad
i was at first hoping you would ask me to the prom
she gathers her things
eyes jim over
nadia contd you should change your shorts
jim is stunned
close on jims tormented face as we hear
you have lost your internet connection
click okay to reconnect
jim is walking through the courtyard a bit dazed
a couple girls pass by him giggling
he trudges along
noticing a clique of girls staring at him as he passes by
and stoner giving him a peace sign
and the computer nerd staring at him like a celebrity
jims pace slows
he hears a snicker behind him
he slows even more taking very careful steps
as he sees a girl doing a really strange dance and his eyes pop out as he sees that yes its his dance
almost everyone is staring at him
jim pulls his coat up over his face and hurries off into the school like a fugitive avoiding the media
people applaud and laugh
kevin and oz catch up to jim
here and there people still give jim funny looks
youre supposed to be supportive
youve still got a chance with nadia right
her sponsors here saw the thing on the net
i dont think they liked it
how do you know that
shes already on a plane back home
jim contd you know maybe im just not good with girls period
like i was born without that part of the brain
i mean i cant talk to girls
and when i do talk to them i screw it up
well come prom night those excuses arent going to do you much good
jesus kevin rub it in
a nearby old janitor starts guffawing at jim as he walks by
jim sits waiting for class to start
some students are obviously talking about him in the background
others study and chat
next to jim is michelle the reject band dork that weve seen earlier
shes got a flute case on her desk
shes blabbering to jim
the kind of blabbering where every other sentence sounds like a question even though it isnt
and so one time
i was at band camp
and we werent supposed to have pillow fights
but we had a pillow fight
and it was so much fun
jim couldnt care
michelle contd and one time we all lost our music
and we were supposed to play this song
but we didnt know it
so we just made it up
and we kept playing and playing but the conductor didnt know what we were doing and it was so funny
jim looks wistfully over at nadias empty desk
michelle contd so youre pissed about something huh
you know what i do when im angry
i just play some bach on my flute
its so relaxing
i learned to do that at band camp
jim perks up the slightest bit
you have no idea why im angry
is it because we have a test tomorrow
sometimes i get cranky when i know i have a big test to study for
yeah thats pretty much it
i thought so
because one time
i was at this interrupting what was your name again
michelle do you want to be my date for the prom
you seriously want to go with me
so forced yes
are we going to steve stiflers party afterwards
that would be so cool
whatever you want
were gonna have so much fun
its like this one time at band camp
heather is walking down the hall
she turns to go into the little auditorium and through the window in the door she sees oz
oz is singing working through the solo
determined to get it right
he bounces his lacrosse ball off the floor in rhythm keeping time
theres one point that he keeps getting stuck at and going back over
heather watches this softening as she sees that oz is actually putting his heart into it
finally hes frustrated dammit
he whips the lacrosse ball at the wall
heather recoils still watching unseen by oz
after a moment oz cools off
he gets the ball and diligently starts up again
heather is impressed
vicky is doing calculus homework as kevin looks on rubbing her shoulders
youre not doing the extra credit problems
no im not
im writing a sequence of random numbers that look like im doing the extra credit problems
bender doesnt bother to check homework past april
thats my trick
its everyones trick kevin
she turns to him but i did pick it up from you
she gives him a little kiss on his hand continuing with her work
kevin keeps rubbing her back more serious
weve come a long way since homecoming
playful yeah we have
you corrupted my four point into a three nine five
indeed i did
but our relationship
its progressed a lot
its time for us to
express ourselves in new ways
vicky stops working and turns sitting up on the desk facing him
her mood has shifted more romantic
well i feel that
things are getting to that point in a relationship
when two people share
a special moment between them
i think youre so right kevin
pause you want to do it
yes she takes his hand
readies herself and declares
i love you
this is definitely not what he was expecting
trying to formulate a response
do you not love me
no i dont not love you
i like i know that weve definitely got something between us
but you dont love me
i didnt say that
i mean love its like a term that gets thrown around
people say things they get married have kids and then what
its like they call it off going i was wrong
vicky seems to know where hes coming from
youre not your dad
the two of us were not your parents
i know vick
im just not ready yet okay
oz is closing up the store
he looks up to see heather at the door
oz goes and opens it surprised embarrassed
the air is awkward between them
how did you know i was here
stifler told me
you talked to stifler
i needed to find you
we are gonna have to practice that song
im um im glad you came by
i mean really
oz lets her in
so you like work nights
an uncomfortable moment for oz
my dads the manager
tell him his subs are great
ah hes always too heavy on the vinegar
if you really want a good one you gotta let me make it
oz is behind the counter
heather walks down the other side as oz assembles a sub
my dads always here running the store busy and stuff
and i fill in once a week so he can get a night off
pause thats nice
shrugs so youre going to michigan
yeah well my parents wanted me to go to northwestern
i didnt want to write all those extra essays they make you do i mean how am i supposed to know what my most emotionally significant moment was
so when my u of m acceptance came in december i said the hell with it
you want onions
so whatre you gonna major in
well states got a good business school
and i can probably walk onto the lacrosse team
so wow youve got it figured out
dismissive well i mean business is okay and lacrosse is awesome but what am i gonna be a pro lacrosse player
i really have no idea
oh thank god i thought i was the only one
well youre not
oil and vinegar
you know people are always like whatre you gonna major in
and i dont know
and theyre like youll figure it out
salt and pepper
oz cuts the sub in half with a flourish and puts it on a tray
so were gonna be close next year
you oh you mean yeah east lansing and ann arbor
a little uncomfortable but nice
wanna swap your chips for cookies
the remains of a couple subs are on a table
oz and heather are doing their song
its rough but theyre working through it
and when theyre in sync they sound really good together
we slowly pull back as they sing into the night
a girl holding out for finch talks to stifler
im sorry i really cant go with you
im holding out for someone else
you gotta be fucking kidding
i know its a long shot but i figure paul finch might ask me
oh gosh i forgot you uh you look okay
i mean you cant even tell
flustered she heads down the stairs
stifler entirely confused heads off into the second floor
as the girl holding out for finch descends kevin catches up with her
what was that all about
hes still embarrassed because finch kicked his ass
knocked out a tooth but you cant see it
right and who told you that
kevin is talking to greta
she points offscreen
kevin is talking to some chick
kevin is talking to yet another girl
we see that his notepad is a spiderweb of girls names all interlinked with arrows
they all point to one girls name in the center of the page jessica
kevin follows jessica down the cafeteria line
are you kidding me
ive never seen someones image change so
it was my idea
did you guys hook up or something
are you kidding
then what the hell are you talking about
i guess its okay for me to tell you now
that reputation of his isnt going anywhere
then finch comes to me and says jessica i need help with this blah blah etcetera
so i told him pay me two hundred bucks and ill tell a couple girls that youre dynamite in bed
so he did and i did
i dont get it that really works
naturally i embellished a little bit
hey did you hear that finch had sex with an older woman
kevin is speechless
damn that one was my favorite
toweled guys exit the steamy showers doing a macho great falls lacrosse chant
they exit frame and we remain on the showers to hear singing happily i needed the shelter of someones arms
there you were woo hoo hoo
he exits in a towel and goes to his locker next to stifler
still singing i needed someone to understand my ups and my downs oh baby there you were
stifler is staring at oz horrified
oh my fucking god
cheery come on you know the words sing along
no thanks youve been singing that shit all week
if you try that at msu this saturday im pretending i dont know you
our last game is this saturday
heather is studying outside
oz stands before her breathless his hair still wet
ive got this lacrosse game
its really important its our last game
and you know central almost beat us last time so i really want to kick their ass and its like cool because were gonna get to play at state which
means that after the game i might be able to stop by
pause you cant sing at the competition
im sorry i totally spaced
i didnt realize it
upset but trying to be cool its okay you should do whatever makes you happy
thanks for understanding
a beat so i guess
ill see you later
an uncomfortable moment
oz walks off
heather looks let down
kevin is at his locker getting ready for class
stifler comes running up with a wicked grin on his face
you seen shitbreak lately
immediately sensing danger oh no stifler what did you do
im the one whose ass he kicked
off kevins look ill tell you one thing though
i dont think hes gonna have a problem shitting in school anymore
stifler pulls out an empty bottle of prescription laxative maniacally laughing
finch is sitting at a table reading his paper
kevin comes tearing around the corner and runs up to him
get to the bathroom
whats in there
why is this
youre gonna shit your pants
finch listen stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your mocash chino or whatever
its fast acting
i mean really fast
first of all its mocha ccino and secondly
finch jumps up and sprints down the hallway
we follow with finch
we see stifler down the hall holding open the bathroom door like a pleasant doorman
this way sit
finch darts into the bathroom
stifler laughs hysterically
finch leaps into a stall and slams the door behind him
finch has stopped
hes staring down at the toilet
it looks entirely uninviting
but hes straining struggling starting to dance around moaning as he cramps up
he grabs a length of toilet paper and lines the seat with it
then another and another
sweat drips off his forehead
come on come on come on
hes got the seat lined with at least three layers of toilet paper
notices a spot where theres still bare toilet seat
he tears off one square of toilet paper placing it on the spot
he steps back and looks it over still wriggling to contain his bowels
you can do this
he unbuckles his pants
sits down just as we hear someone enter the bathroom
finch still restraining listens for a moment
only to hear the click click click of heels
the bathroom door swings closed to reveal the universal symbol for women
stifler is there laughing even harder
finch is terrified
through the crack between the stall door and the frame finch catches glimpses of bright colored skirts and dresses
he grits his teeth straining
and a gurgle comes from finchs stomach
his eyes bulge
a group of girls is at the mirror including the girl holding out for finch fixing their hair
you know its just gonna be some crappy band and stupid decorations
youre just saying that cause proms a week away and you dont have a date
no i dont want a date
increasingly dreamy finch is going stag
and so am i
the guy is like so
finch is in hell
desperately trying not to shit
holding it in for all hes worth
do you think that older woman thing is true
of course it was stiflers mom
finch is sweating badly
every muscle in his body is tensed
tears stream from his fiercely shut eyes
a gastric rumbling
finchs eyes flash open in terror
we hear another deeper rumbling
girl turns to her friend in surprise
joanie was that you
finch is struggling
rocking back and forth
but its no use
hes at his limit
the girls at the mirror freeze and we hear what can only be the sound of diarrhea exploding into a toilet bowl
the girls run out screaming and laughing
finch exits the stall with trepidation pulling up his pants
slowly slinking he approaches the door
grabs the handle
and like nothing ever happened he opens it
finch comes out of the bathroom
his eyes register complete disbelief
a semi circle of girls including the ones we have seen gossiping about him has crowded around the door
all staring at him with complete repugnance open mouthed
oz is playing in the final lacrosse game
the team scores theyre beating central
everyone cheers except oz
we see jim and kevin in the stands cheering
the campus of michigan state university
students pass in front of an older impressive university building
a sign out front reads michigan statewide vocal heather and the rest of the vocal jazz group are behind the curtain
they all wear flashy borderline cool outfits
heather looks worried lost
looking to the door as if oz might come running in
albert you ready
albert steps next to heather
hes kind of funny looking with an overly suave attitude that comes off as plain weird
he sings a couple lines
way too melodramatic and cheesy
heather looks trapped
a scoreboard shows that east is leading by five goals
oz is running up the field towards the goal cradling the ball in his stick
he seems to have a good lead
suddenly he is tumbling falling losing the ball
someone has checked him
he lays stunned on the ground as stifler recovers the ball and scores
the players run back to the sidelines to reset for the face off and gather around the coach
good hustle guys but we can still lose
you all saw what happened to oz out there
i dont ever want to see you guys thinking youre gonna score
you dont score until you score period
the team is getting into it
shouts of hell yeah
but ozs got a quizzical look on his face
heather waits with the group to go onstage
albert paces like a shakespearean actor psyching himself
focus on the music
let the music be my guide
that would be a start
oz shows some emotion peeking through
it all boils down to today
for you seniors this marks the culmination of your past four years
think of what that means to you
are you guys gonna look back on your days at east and know that you made the most of the time you had
a wave of realization washes over oz
he stands up tall
coach marshall contd now thats the attitude ostreicher
oz collects himself
takes a deep breath
good luck guys
he sets his lacrosse stick down and starts to leave
i didnt say you were out of the game
what the fuck is this
you got someplace more important to be
coach marshall is fuming
the entire team is staring at oz
he runs off
a beat of confusion
then they stand up
oz runs through a gate
the vocal jazz group is on their feet lined up waiting to go onstage
oz bursts into the room still in his lacrosse gear
oz youre back yeah oh great
oz rushes up to heather
shes happy but confused
what about the game
im not playing
youre missing the game for us
im missing the game for you
oz pulls her close
and they kiss
you guys got about a minute to go
spend it warming up not making out
this aint the prom yet
oz and heather share a smile
the vocal jazz group is belting their hearts out singing how sweet it is
oz sings with them now in his vocal jazz outfit
we tilt down to see hes still wearing his cleats
he and heather sound great backed by the vocal jazz group
they sail through their duet join hands and finish perfectly
the audience applauds with enthusiasm and we kevin and jim whooping and clapping loving it like theyre at a rock concert
gives that you rock
hand sign you fuckin rule
class has just ended students are filing out of the classroom
a teacher grades papers in the back of the room routinely writing a a a a on each paper
vicky is studying a pull down map hanging over the chalkboard
kevin comes up next to her
did you know that its
miles from ann arbor to nashville
its like a six or seven hour drive
thats easy i dont mind driving
kevin looks back over his shoulder to the inattentive teacher
moves closer to vicky
about the other day
ive been thinking
so have i
and i know you want to make things perfect for me
and i understand that you really wouldnt tell me that until you were comfortable with it
vicky looks over to the teacher who coughs
she steps closer
kevin somewhat nervous takes the bottom of the map fidgeting with it a little
and i want to make things perfect for you
youre right kev we do have something good
yeah we have something great vick
very close whispered i want to have sex with you
the map goes flapping upwards
the teacher looks up
almost frightened now
i know the perfect time
she looks to the calendar on the wall
and taps next saturday prom
kevin cant believe it
music up for pre prom montage jim is trying on a tux
he shrugs like it fits well enough
he turns to see oz trying on his oz is fidgeting trying on different ties vests shoes very sincere and focused
vicky is trying on a rather elegant dress looking to jessica for support showing it off
jessica jokingly does the same showing off her shorts and t shirt as if she could care
finch sits alone
not like alone
more like forrest gump
jim is paying for his tux
we see oz trying to decide on a cumberbund
there are about ten of them scattered around him that hes already tried
in the background an attendant looks impatient
finch still sits
his head is cocked at a different angle
jims dad fixes jims bow tie
kevin is in his tux
hes staring at himself in the mirror
the parking lot is full
various formally dressed students make their way into the school
one group piles out of a stretch limo
we see a stealthy student slip a bottle of liquor into his tux
a flustered guy struggles to re attach his dates corsage
this is the prom
the gym is decorated in a clashingly festive manner
like a combination of mardi gras new years eve and somebodys bar mitzvah
a crappy band plays crappy most students mill about talking generally bored
the only people who are enjoying themselves are the obviously drunk students slam dancing with the obviously drunk stifler in a corner
chaperone parents try to calm them down futilely
the band breaks into a cheesy ballad
couples lock together and sway back and forth like zombies
theyre dancing at arms length
jim is not enthused
you know at band camp
we have dances like this
only theyre way funner
dont you think prom is just highly overrated
highly highly overrated
both looking a little nervous
dancing much slower than anyone else
heathers got her head on his shoulder eyes closed
dancing with the girl holding out for finch
kevin oz jim and finch are hanging out
finch is drunk
im here for your dumb
sherman passes by
im on the offensive boys
the sherman tank is going back in
the guys are impassive
sherman indicates the central girl nearby
locked on target flying in stealth mode under enemy sex radar
ready to drop the payload
again sherman confidently walks off
alright how do you guys stand
well finch i know where you are but you cant use that as an excuse
my dates a flute toting band dork
that answer your question
oz how about you and heather
now you guys are a couple or something
getting ticked dammit kevin whats with the attitude
i think that you guys should be more enthusiastic
shit weve been trying to get laid forever and tonights the night weve been waiting for
were in this together
dont back out on me now
you dont need us to get laid
you afraid or something
no but come on guys we made a pact
kevin it was just a it was a pact you break it and there are no excuses
you guys have to interrupting pissed i dont have to do shit
forget it already
kevin is taken aback
jim contd im tired of all this bullshit pressure
i mean ive never even had sex and already i cant stand it
i hate sex
i dont want it ive never wanted it and im not gonna sit here busting my balls over something that just isnt that damn important
so fuck this stupid pact fuck you and fuck sex
now im gonna go hang out with that geek over there cause at least shes got something else to talk about besides sex
kevin storms off
at least i learned how to shit in school
shes dressed well but not lavishly
finch looks to the guys
we follow with jessica and finch as they dance out onto the floor
how come you have no date
i like to keep my options open
and let me just clarify that you have no chance of scoring with me finch
no of course not dont be ridiculous
so i guess you and sherman are pretty close
you met at that party a while back
yeah we were up the whole night together
we had one of those amazingly deep conversations where you really feel like you get to know someone
nudge nudge deep conversation huh
is that what you guys call it
what else would i call it
kevin sits on the steps into the school depressed
the central girl has taken over the bands microphone
excuse me everyone sorry to interrupt
her voice reverberates throughout the gym
a couple wolf central girl contd i just wanted to let you all know this chuck sherman is a liar
i never had sex with him
hes never had sex with anyone i know because he told me
once he tried to screw a grapefruit but thats it
oh and he also told me that sometimes when he gets nervous he wets his pants
thank you for your attention
girls around the gym cheer and applaud
pissing his pants
he looks back to oz who shares his expression
kevin still sits there
jim oz and finch come out of the school
slowly they walk up to kevin
i dont care
kevin come on the bus to stiflers is gonna be here soon
im not going
a beat as the guys dont know what to say
kevins speech is halting downbeat
this isnt how i wanted things to turn out
making the pact wasnt just about getting laid
it was about doing one last thing with you guys before we graduated
but now ive just wasted my last few weeks here trying to do what
i dont even know
all i managed to do was fuck up our friendship
i still think youre okay
so do i kev
for the most part
fuck you guys are right i dont know what im doing
i mean im acting like ive got it all together tonight
but i know vicky is gonna ask me if i love her
and i dont know what im gonna say
so now its like maybe ill just wimp out on the whole thing
come on man
tonight is the night
were finally going to a post prom party on the lake
weve been waiting to do this for the last four years
why else are we still friends with stifler
you gotta go
a beat as kevin ponders this
and by the way sherman didnt even get laid
he pissed himself
the guys laugh as kevin is puzzled
they are suddenly illuminated by the glare of headlights
a charter bus pulls in front of the school
there it is
i want to grab my bag
oh and my date
come on kevin
vickys looking for you
jim holds out a helping hand
kevin looks at it
grabs it and jim pulls him up
a beautiful cottage on the shore of lake michigan
students are filing out of the charter bus
jim and michelle are walking up to the cottage
stiflers mom got it in the divorce
it reminds me of this one time changing thoughts hey can i ask you a question
how come you dont have any stories
ive got lots of stories and you dont have any
oh ive got stories believe me
theyre a little more risque than tales of band camp
are they gross or something like guy stuff
you want a story
heres a story
stifler finds this beer right
kevin leads vicky into the bedroom
a large bay window overlooks moonlit lake michigan
see this is the nicest room
vicky opens a closet to find stiflers little brother inside grinning
you guys are gonna fuck arent you
get out of here
running out of the room fuckers fuckers fuckers fuckers
stiflers brother is gone
and vicky closes the door
oz and heather are walking down the beach
deep in the background we see kids partying
theres something ive been meaning to tell you heather
its gonna sound really bad but i want you to know
they stop walking
oz swipes his feet around in the sand
oz contd see uh im a virgin
and me kevin jim and finch we all made this pact
that we would
lose our virginity
before high school was over
heather is listening
oz contd and see tonight is supposed to be the night we all do it
this isnt the best way to proposition me
no thats not what i mean
i mean look
you know what made me leave that game
coach was giving this speech about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score
this isnt any better chris
no see heather what i realized is that
with you its not like im running towards the goal trying to figure out the best way to score
and this may sound corny but he takes her hand
oz contd i feel like ive already won
heather softens taken off guard
oz contd and well i really care about you
and i want you to know that
oz its okay i know
you called me oz
well thats what your friends call you
i feel like im one of your friends now
oz seems truly touched
my middle name is dieter
heather nods and speaks pensively
you know thats cracking up really a shitty middle name
laughing i know it sucks
through their laughter they kiss
after a moment it grows more passionate
lost in each other
the party rages in the rest of the cottage but the basement is empty
stiflers mom sits in the corner smoking a cigarette
shes as attractive as her photo we once saw but the divorce has replaced her sexy smile with a bitter smirk
finch stumbles in
ah stiflers mom
thank you for letting us have a great party
dry as if there were any alternative in the matter
are you enjoying yourself
im three sheets to the wind maam
deadpan im so happy for you
takes the edge off doesnt it
and where might your date be
oh no no date
finch pauses a moment
hes got an idea
you have anything to drink
i believe the kegs are upstairs
no no thats what the cretins drink
i mean alcohol liquor good stuff
she considers him as she drags off her cigarette
all right i got some scotch
aged eighteen years
she gives him a look why dont you get the glasses
behind the bar
its a great party
stifler is with a group of guys drinking a beer which he inspects very carefully before every sip
both drinking and talking almost enjoying themselves
that is a nasty story
i told you
you wanna hear a nasty story of mine
its kind of sexual
a light goes off in jims head
yeah bring it on
well this one time
at band camp
we were playing this game i dont know if you know it
but its called spin the bottle
and i had to kiss this guy named marc wander on the lips
jims expression sinks
the lights are down
vicky and kevin are in bed
yeah are you
you sure youre comfortable
are you sure
a beat did you bring a condom
yeah right here
he pulls out a condom
a beat as they contemplate it
so do you want to be i mean how do you want to do it
i dont know
how do you
like normal style
a moment as they realize theres nothing left to do but vicky contd kevin
i want to hear you say it
kevin swallows hard
and says victoria
i love you
i love you
they both take a deep breath
oz and heather lay in a secluded spot in the dunes surrounded by tall beach grass that swishes in the spring breeze
stars and a lustrous moon above
the silence speaks
we can see it in their eyes
i cant think of anything to say thats not cheesy
a brief moment of uncertainty
kevin shifts around a bit trying to position himself
vickys hand goes under the sheets
we know what shes doing
they both maintain eye contact
heather and oz are re inventing the idea of passion
this is the stuff that you thought only existed in romance novels
jim is trying to stay interested in michelles drivel
so the end of the story is
you had to kiss the guy for twenty seconds
and he was such a dork
and everyone laughed at me but i didnt care
because it was so funny
flat okay i get it
and then this one time
at band camp
i stuck a flute in my pussy
jim chokes on his beer
michelle considers her revelation no big deal watching with some amusement as jim struggles to recover
what you think i dont know how to get myself off
hell thats what half of band camp is
jim is ga ga
he watches in disbelief as she lets her hair down
and wouldnt you know it shes pretty cute
michelle contd so are we gonna screw soon
im getting kind of antsy
jim pauses in disbelief
then michelle and jim burst in and slam the door
a toy basketball hoop falls off the back of the door
they are standing in a cluttered toy strewn pit of a kids room
one of those stupid plastic airplanes on a string hangs from the ceiling flying in circles
now i have two rubbers
wear them both itll desensitize you
i dont want you coming so damn early
why uh what makes you think that i come on
i saw you on the net
why do you think i accepted this date
youre a sure thing
jim heartily agrees
the scotch bottle is almost empty
stiflers mom and finch are smoking cigarettes
would you object if i said youre quite striking
mister finch are you trying to seduce me
yes maam i am
one look between them and we know its all over
kevin and vicky
silently doing it
curious looks on their faces
the look you get when your waiter delivers your food in a fancy restaurant and you look at the creation on the plate and secretly youre not sure if its
really what you ordered
but you dont say anything and you just eat it
oz and heather
we can hear jim and michelle going at it like a couple of howling banshees over a series of shots a piggy bank gets knocked over and shatters
an x wing fighter flies across the room
a pillow explodes in a cloud of feathers
one of the legs on the bed breaks
the basement door is closed
we hear from the inside
i had no idea youd be this good
neither did i
jim and michelle going at it
again we hear but cant see them
the room is more trashed than before
and as we pan across the disaster area theyve created are you gonna do what i think youre gonna do
dont you want me to
put it in your mouth
we see her
on top of jim
she clears her throat
and then we see her raise a childrens plastic recorder to her lips and she whistles the michigan fight song
on cue jim chimes in hail hail to michigan the leaders and best
oz could be coming
heather could be coming
but its all so darn passionate that the whole thing looks like one big orgasm anyway
jim and michelle lay on the floor tangled in sheets and each others clothing
and then we see the closet door is open just a crack
it swings open
standing there is stiflers little brother
that was awesome jim and michelle are stunned
finch and stiflers mom are just off camera
we cant see it but we can tell finchs status from his orgasmic what we do see is the kitchen door handle rattling
the chair falling out of place
and the door opening as stifler walks in
he stops horrified
he looks like hes going to barf
instead he passes out
the sun rises over lake michigan
a brand new day
various students are passed out here and there
oz holds heather in his arms
seagulls call to each other
waves break on the shore
oz has lost all pretense
smiling to himself or maybe to the world
jim wakes up in bed alone
he looks around
he considers this
jim contd oh my god
she used me
he considers this further
jim contd wow
i was used
he jumps up and does a little dance singing
to the victors valiant hail
to the conquering heroes hail
kevin and vicky lie next to each other in bed staring at the ceiling
though theyre trying to conceal it we can see a bit of dissatisfaction uncertainty peeking through
that was a great night
i cant believe we just had our senior prom
yeah the time went by so fast
kevin next year
with you in ann arbor and me in nashville
its not gonna work is it
dont say that we can do it somehow
it might not be perfect but interrupting no kevin she sits up thats the whole thing thats what ive been realizing
that nothings perfect that you cant plan everything
kevin thinks this over
it is far away
and well be on our own
meeting new people
a moment as they think this over
i wasnt lying
a beat lets go
dont you have something to tell your friends
your little pact
jessica told me all about it
hits him lightly way to go kev
kevin gives an embarrassed smile
a sign on the window reads congratulations seniors
the four newly non virgins munch on hot dogs
kevins to jim i guess well call you two ply
so you want double condiments on that
no no thats fine
then to kevin so you doing okay
a wistful smile yeah
ill tell you ive learned one thing women like wine get better with age
a beat of course i have no frame of reference for this comparison
so oz you almost made it huh
smiles ill just say that we had a great night together
hang in there buddy youll get there
you two really have something going dont you
i think were falling in love
oz just smiles
you know what the coolest thing is
this right now
they guys keep eating uncertain what to say
i mean after this everythingll be different
after getting laid
after high school
yeah but well still see each other
fuck yeah we will
kevin raises his pepsi
to the next step
to the next step
they all toast
kevin is on the phone
into phone hey
i got another question for you
kevin arrives in the back of the library
kneels down to put the bible back
im sort of wondering about
we hear kevins brother chuckle knowingly
thats the next book kevin
thats the next book
he puts the bible back without the reverence he once had for it
stands up with some new confidence
we follow with him as he walks out of the library
and enters the courtyard crowded with students
he disappears into them as we
jims dad sits across from jim
eyes tearing son
thats the best damn story i ever heard
jim beams proudly
you know after i graduated high school my parents let me do some traveling
a waiter ascends a beautiful red carpeted staircase carrying a tray with bottle of champagne and a rose
he arrives in front of a hotel door
a bellboy passes by noticing the waiter
and he speaks to him in subtitled another bottle
subtitled he knows how to treat a woman
the door opens to reveal jim sweaty but not the least bit tired tying on a robe
a pair of arms wraps around him from behind
and nadia peeks her head over jims shoulder
come back to bed james
jim smiles to the guys and takes the tray as nadia pulls him back in and closes the door
subtitled that is one lucky man
subtitled funny i swear i have seen those two somewhere before
the boy is some sort of dancer
they head off
