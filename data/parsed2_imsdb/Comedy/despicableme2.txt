written by cinco paul ken daurio snow and ice as far as the eye can see
what looks like a windowless military base surrounded by barbed wire fences sits in the middle of the wasteland
at the guard gate two russian guards play poker using an overturned barrel as a table
russian guard shows a five of diamonds
and four aces
the other guard folds
russian guard laughs and drags in the pile of coins
while he speaks in russian and does a celebratory dance the coins fly up into the air
russian guard stops dancing and sees that the coins are gone
he accuses the other guard of stealing them
russian guard swears he didnt take them
russian guard grabs a shovel and wields it menacingly until it flies up into the air
they both look up to see where its gone
then the metal barrel they were using as a table flies up knocking them over
russian guard looks up to see a gigantic magnet ship a watchtower guard shouts
a door below opens as a bunch of guards run out and point their guns at the magnet ship
all of their guns are pulled up towards the ship including the guards themselves who are strapped to their guns
a snowmobile lifts off the ground and flies up to the magnet
other vehicles and small buildings begin to pull away from the ground
the lab makes contact with the ship
it flies up and down shaking the scientists and guards off
they fall to the ground
the magnet ship flies away with their lab vehicles and weapons
the remaining guards and scientists are strewn across the snow with the remnants of the damaged base
we see a porta potty door open
a confused guard is sitting on the can reading a newspaper having missed the entire incident
he closes the door
security footage of the research station named px labs being carried away by the magnet ship plays on the screens at avl headquarters
we see the back of several heads watching the footage
theres a heavy sigh
three weeks and were still no closer to cracking this
bring him in
gru steps toward camera holding some sort of menacing gun which he loads and cocks
he pulls the trigger which shoots out an inflatable unicorn balloon
smiling he ties it to the windowsill next to some others
a banner reads happy birthday agnes
and a massive backyard party is in full swing
the yard is decorated with pink balloons and streamers and a bouncy house shaped like a castle
agnes and several other little girls slide down a slide
they are all dressed as princesses but agnes is dressed as a princess riding a unicorn
this is the best party ever
edith dressed as a ninja emerges from beneath a table and climbs across the monkey bars as a series of jousts blades and boxing gloves come up from the ground
she jumps down narrowly avoiding a bear trap
two little girls fish in a small kiddie pool
one of the girls pulls up a toy duck and then razzes the other girl but then a live piranha jumps out and eats the toy duck
a boy and a girl sword fight
the boy does a bunch of fancy moves
the girl waits for him to finish and then pounds him on the head with a club
two kids in the background are on a see saw made of bombs
agnes runs into the middle of the yard and points offscreen
a dragon is approaching
all of the kids turn and see kyle dressed as a dragon
he grumbles and then they scream and huddle around agnes
then margo enters wearing a suit of armor and wielding a sword
fear not for here come the gallant knights to save us
she gestures to a group of minions wearing tiny suits of armor and wielding various medieval weapons
the kids cheer as the minions charge toward kyle
one accidentally hits another with his sword
a fight ensues in which they use the medieval weapons on each other
one minion pounds another with a mace
one minion wanders off from the fight with his helmet on backwards wildly swinging his mace
across the yard gru is busy grilling burgers and talking on the phone
no no no
what do you mean shes not coming
i have a backyard full of these little girls who are counting on a visit from a fairy princess
the mace swinging minion walks by and accidently repeatedly hits gru with the mace in the shin
gru kicks the minions helmet and chases him off with a spatula sending him towards the party swinging his mace
gru sighs and returns to the call
i dont want a refund
i want a fairy princess
please i am begging you
resigned you know what
i hope that you can sleep at night you crusher of little girls dreams
gru hits the phone with his spatula and hangs up
turns and sees agnes standing there
whens the fairy princess coming
gru stares down at agnes big excited eyes
he opens his mouth to tell her the truth but cant do it
any minute now
agnes squeals with excitement and runs off
gru looks worried what do i do now
he signals two minions
a hand painted piece of cardboard reading the magic show is placed on an easel
agnes and all of the little kids sit in a semicircle on the grass
two minions dressed as magicians are doing a magic act with edith as their assistant
one minion blows up a balloon and puts it in ediths mouth
then the other whips out a chainsaw and fires it up heading toward her
margo sees this and quickly intervenes
okay okay alright
thats enough of the magic show
the minions dont hide their disappointment
margo suddenly looks around as if she just heard something
wait did you hear that
it sounded like the twinkling sounds of magical fairy dust
gasps its the fairy princess
margo gasps and points up to the sky
edith spits out her magic balloon in horror and we follow it up to reveal gru
dressed in a puffy pink dress fairy wings glittery eyelashes and tiara and magical wand
up on top of grus house the minions struggle to lower him down on a rope
ediths balloon floats by and distracts them
they let go of the rope and gru swings wildly smashing into the wall of the house and crashing to the ground
he stands up and tries to cover
agnes sighs happily in awe of the fairy princess
in falsetto it is i gru
the most magical fairy princess of all
and i am here to wish princess agnes a very happy birthday
gru sprinkles the girls with glitter and they continue to stare frozen
then a little girl raises her hand and speaks with a lisp
how come youre tho fat
gru grits his teeth then forces a smile and speaks with a high pitched dreamy voice
because my house is made of candy and sometimes i eat instead of facing my problems
the girl starts to ask another question
how come you have gru cuts her off with a puff of fairy dust to the face
time for cake
as the kids run to the table agnes approaches gru
thank you gru zinkerbell
youre the best fairy princess ever
in falsetto you are welcome little girl
she runs off but quickly returns
whispers in his ear i know its really you gru
im just pretending for the other kids
she runs off again to join her friends
gru watches her go
couldnt be happier
then he is approached by jillian a heavily botoxed mom
hey there gru mr
life of the party
forcing a smile hello jillian
sooooo im gonna go out on a limb here but my friend natalie is recently single and
in the background a homely natalie leans against a buffet table and seductively raises her eyebrows at gru
the table collapses to the ground beneath her
realizes whats going on no no no get off of the limb right now
oh come on
shes a riot
she sings karaoke she has a lot of free time looks arent that important to her
in the background natalie inadvertently walks in front of a bottle pitch game is struck by a ball and falls to the ground
no jills that is not happening
calling after gru okay fine
how about my cousin linda
gru walks off passing by edith and margo
i know someone whose husband just died
suddenly jillian is sprayed in the face with water
reveal gru holding a hose with a spray nozzle
i did not see you there
he sprays her again
she falls down
he drops the hose and walks away chuckling softly
gru takes kyle out to the front yard
a camera with nightvision is watching them
the screen analyzes kyle and a readout comes out as species unknown
kyle sniffs grus flowers
then it analyzes gru and the readout says target acquired
no do not do your business on the petunias
kyle lifts up his leg next to grus flowers
he picks kyle up and places him next to his neighbors bush
there you go
those are freds
kyle does and the bush immediately withers and dies
gru good boy
gru turns and sees lucy wilde standing there
holds up her badge hi
agent lucy wilde of the avl
realizes her badge is upside down oh
clears her throat all business sorry youre gonna have to come with me
oh sorry i freeze ray
gru whips out his freeze ray and fires it
a wall of ice heads for lucy
but before it gets to her lucy pulls out a retractable gun from her purse which acts as a flamethrower
melting the ice
you know you really should announce your weapons after you fire them mr
for example she pulls out a lipstick
fires it at gru
the tip flies through the air and connects with his chest latching on
it tases him which sends his body flailing in different funny poses before passing out
oh it works so good
lucy tries to drag gru to her car but hes too heavy
she gets an idea
lucy gets into her car
in the background we see gru begin to come to but he is struck by lucys car as she pulls back and is knocked out again
closer now lucy gets out and stuffs his body into the trunk
just then tom and stuart come out of grus garage and see their boss being loaded in
lucy struggles to close the trunk
lucy finally slams the trunk then quickly gets into the vehicle
tom and stuart exchange horrified looks
they take off running after the car as it pulls away running as fast as their tiny legs will carry them
they get right behind it and tom leaps up onto the trunk
he reaches his hand out to stuart who is falling behind
koom ey lah
koom ey lah
koom ey lah
stuart leaps for the bumper and tom catches him by his overall straps
tom holds on tight as stuart dangles from the back of the car his overall straps stretching way out
as lucy turns a corner he slams into some garbage cans and ends up skiing behind the car in a cardboard box
now in the box stuart continues to ride behind the car and even starts to get the hang of that too
he waves at tom and tom waves back
all is good until they go past a clothesline and a sheet gets stuck on stuart
the sheet forms a parasail which lifts stuart up into the air
he strikes a superman flying pose
then a flock of geese fly toward him and one actually slams into his face
it squawks at him as it flies off
lucy spots the commotion in her side view mirror and slams on the brakes
both minions fly forward lucy sees this drives forward and opens the convertible top causing the minions to land right in the passengers seat
they strike threatening karate poses
lucy tases them and they pass out
she floors it
lucys car continues driving until it reaches a crowded pier
and doesnt stop
it drives right off the end of the pier
a confused fisherman leaps for his life
what the oh
lucys car now transforms into an underwater vehicle
as the minions come to one of them tries playing with the radio until lucy slaps his hand away
they speed through the sea and an octopus slams into her windshield
she turns on the wipers which hits the octopus in the face until hes had enough and swims off in a cloud of ink
she honks her horn as she passes through a school of fish
as the fish pass the minions look ahead to see a shark heading for them with his mouth open
lucy quickly steers the car out of harms way
they pass by several more sharks until they arrive at a giant submarine with the letters avl on the side
a hatch opens and lucys car goes inside
the hatch closes behind her
the water drains out from the holding dock
a buffer and hair dryer come out to dry off the car
a squeegee wipes off the windshield
then the platform the car is on lowers down
lucys car lowers into the center of the room as a large circular table assembles around it effectively locking them in
lucy and the minions get out of the car
she pushes a button on her remote and gru with a starfish attached to his head is ejected from the trunk
oh foots asleep
pins and needles
good afternoon mr
i apologize for our methods in getting you here
id do it again in a heartbeat
i am not gonna lie i enjoyed that
every second of it
gave me a bit of a buzz actually
thats enough agent wilde
okay this is bogus
gru peels the starfish off his head and drops it onto toms
stuart laughs at him
i dont know who you people think you are but a waiter comes over with tea for silas
we are the anti villain league
as silas summons a map that shows all of the avl offices around the world lucys car drops out of the way
stuart is trapped on the lowering platform and he scrambles to get back onto stable ground
an ultra secret organization dedicated to fighting crime on a global scale
rob a bank
were not interested
not our deal
but you want to melt the polar ice caps
or vaporize mt
or even steal the moon
then we notice
first of all youve got no proof that i did that
second after i did do that i put it back
were well aware of that mr
thats why weve brought you here
beat i am the leagues director silas ramsbottom
upon hearing the name tom and stuart start giggling
silas bristles at this and glances over at lucy
oh me now
she continues the de briefing turning to the screens which show an image of the magnet ship stealing the lab
um recently an entire top secret lab disappeared from the arctic circle
yeah the entire lab
where did it go
i dont care
the screen shows footage of a tiny little bunny in a scientific lab
furry and adorable
the lab was devoted to experiments involving px a transmutation serum
what is px you ask
mmmm its pretty bad
a labcoat technician approaches the bunny with a syringe containing the purple liquid
injects some in its butt
instantly the bunny transforms into a hideous purple monster bunny
gru and the minions smile impressed
then it goes crazy and attacks the scientist
gru covers his eyes and the minions pass out
the bunny attacks the technician then the camera
and the film is over
hmm you usually dont see that in bunnies
as you can see in the wrong hands the px serum could be the most devastating weapon on earth
struggles to get through the opening in the table fortunately it has a very distinct chemical footprint and using the latest chemtracking technology we found traces of it in the
on the screens we see images depicting a highly technical diagram of the shopping mall
and we believe that one of these shop owners is a master criminal
silas scrolls through pictures of the malls shop owners
and thats where you come in
as an ex villain you know how a villain thinks how a villain acts
the plan is to set you up undercover at a shop in the mall where hopefully youll be able to okay i see where this is going with all the
mission impossible stuff but no
i am a father now
and a legitimate businessman
i am developing a line of delicious jams and jellies
silas shoots him a look
so thanks but no thanks
beat and heres a tip instead of tasing people and kidnapping them maybe you should just give them a call
good day mr
chuckles oh yeah like thats any better
gru turns and heads for the door followed by tom and stuart who continue to giggle about ramsbottoms name
gru exits the avl headquarters which he now sees is on a lucy leans out the door and taps him on the shoulder
look i probably shouldnt be saying this but your work as a villain was kind of amazing so if you ever want to get back to doing something awesome give
us a call
she hands gru her business card
gru takes it and stares at it
gru rows back to shore as tom yells to him like a coxswain
gru grunts with each stroke
gru carries a sleeping agnes upstairs
gru enters to find margo and edith not in bed
margo is texting someone
whispers hey i told you guys to get to bed
so when ya goin on your date
miss jillian said she was arranging a date for you
yeah well she is a nutjob
and im not going on any date
are you scared
gru stares back at edith
gets a far away look in his eyes
we flash back to little gru on the school playground
he stares lovesick at a cute little blonde girl named lisa
to her friends hey did you guys see the moon landing on tv
yeah i cant believe it
its so cool
yeah and you know what gru approaches her
excuse me lisa
but she doesnt notice him
he tries again
to her friends i was talking to billy the other day
he is so cute
gru clears his throat
and i think he likes me
hey lisa i was wondering if you gru reaches out and taps her shoulder with his pointer finger
then one of the other little girls points to grus finger on lisas shoulder
gru touched lisa
gru touched lisa
the other girls turn and squeal horrified
a little buck toothed red haired girl shouts out to the entire playground
lisas got grooties
the playground erupts with screams and everyone turns and runs away
little gru is left alone
gru comes out of the flashback
no thats bonkers
i just i have no interest in going on a date thats all
im not scared of women
lets go to bed
gru gives each girl a goodnight kiss
then he goes over to margo whos already in bed
she continues texting as he gives her a kiss
whoa whoa whoa whoa
well hold the horses
who are you texting
just my friend avery
is that a girls name or a boys name
does it matter
no no it doesnt matter
unless its a boy
i know what makes you a boy
gru turns to agnes concerned
your bald head
gru nods relieved
its really smooth
sometimes i stare at it and imagine a little chick popping out
peep peep peep
gru sighs and gives her a kiss
never get older
gru turns out the light and leaves the room
gru rides the elevator tube down to his lab passing minions in various stages of jelly making
a sign reading jelly testing area has been hastily pasted over a nuclear warning sign
a supervisor minion checks his clipboard as the minion next to him steals a banana from his pocket
he turns but the minion who stole the banana has hidden it in his mouth
we see the ends of the banana pushing out his cheeks
the minion with the banana in his mouth shrugs
a single apple is passed down a line of minions in the least efficient way possible
a few minions mash fruits in large vats ala i love lucy
one wears a bunch of fruit on his head like carmen miranda and sings the chiquita banana song
his supervisor comes over and tells him to get back to work
the minion tries to get out of the vat of fruit but slips and falls down into a large test tube filled with mashed fruit
then all of the mashed fruit is flushed down a large hole where it is injected into jelly jars passing by on a conveyor belt
the trapped minion is injected into one of the jars
gru enters the lab and greets the minions
hey tim nice haircut
he points at tim
donnie hang in there baby
its almost friday
gru high fives donnie as he approaches dr
so hows todays batch dr
i developed a new formula which allowed me to get every known kind of berry into one flavor of jelly
gru sticks his finger in and tastes the purple goo in the jar
makes a disgusted face then attempts a smile
faking it that tastes good
gags love the flavor of that
its horrible isnt it
oh were making great progress
to the minions here try some of this
he hands a jar to a minion who tries it
another minion tastes some and scrapes it off his tongue
they smash the jar and all the minions run away disgusted
okay just because everybody hates it doesnt mean its not good
nefario hangs his head
theres something ive been meaning to talk to you about for some time now
clears his throat i miss being evil
sinister plots large scale crimes
its what i live for
i mean dont you think theres more to our future than jelly
well im also considering a line of jams
the thing is gru
deep breath ive had an offer of employment elsewhere
come on youre kidding right
its a great opportunity for me bigger lab more evil full dental
nefario presses a button and his stuff folds itself up into a traveling suitcase
nefario hangs his head
gru stares back at his old friend
let us give you the proper send off
calls off screen minions
seven minions are lined up with seven fart guns
nefario sits in his scooter
the highest honor awarded
nefario for your years of service
the twenty one fart gun salute
his eyes are watering and not only from the smell
uh i counted twenty two
dave chuckles guilty
nefario fires up the scooter
farewell my friends
the minions cry
nefario pushes another button on the scooter transforming it into flying mode
he guns the engine and it begins flying away
at the slowest pace possible
everyone just stands there awkwardly
this may take a while
go about your business
everyone walks off
i miss you already
gru examines lucys business card
makes a decision
the shadow of a mysterious figure approaches grus front door
a minion wears a french maids outfit and sings as he vacuums the floor
the doorbell rings
the minion opens the door to see who it is
a shadow falls across the terrified minion as something unseen abducts him
the vacuum moves back and forth across the floor by itself
another minion walks by wearing a different maid outfit
he doesnt see the other minion and closes the door
then he opens it again cleans the doorknob and closes it
its morning at grus house
margo and agnes sit on the couch with a laptop
edith leans over the top of the couch looking on
are you sure we should be doing this
yes its for his own good
on the screen is a dating website create a date
net the girls are creating a profile for gru
okay we need to choose a picture
margo clicks through pictures of gru
each one is worse than the last
the next picture is of gru in a bathing suit
the girls react in horror
margo covers agness eyes
what is that
gru enters the family room
good morning girls
i have an announcement to make
hey what celebrity do you look like
the girls stare at him blankly
the girls laugh
okay what are you doing
were signing you up for online dating
no no no no no no no no no
gru grabs the laptop away from the girls
aw come on its fun
and its time for you to get out there
no one is ever getting out there
gru hands a minion the laptop accidentally hitting him in the face
okay now for the announcement i have accepted a new job
yes i have been recruited by a top secret agency to go undercover and save the world
youre gonna be a spy
thats right baby
grus back in the game
with gadgets and weapons and cool cars
the whole deal
agnes looks up at him in awe
are you really gonna save the world
gru looks at agnes
yes i am
he coolly puts on a pair of sunglasses
we pan to dave mimicking gru with a pair of sunglasses
and then to kevin dressed in an amish beard and tie
and then stuart dressed as a little girl with pigtails
gru comes down the escalator wearing the sunglasses with the three disguised minions behind him
stuart gets his dress caught in the escalator
it comes off and he hides in a nearby potted plant
gru glances at a store called the eagle hair club
he then arrives at a charming pink cupcake store
the sign reads bake my day gru frowns and takes off his sunglasses
bake my day
gru unlocks the door and enters
bells on the door ring
the inside is sugary and clean and quaint
gru takes it all in
then turns to the minions
alright here is the cupcake recipe i got off the internet
the minions excitedly grab the recipe and head for the kitchen
gru kicks stuart who is still staggering around in the potted plant
and dont go nuts with the sprinkles
gru is left alone
he looks around
sees a bunny cupcake in a glass cake dish
then a shark cupcake in the next cake dish
and in the next dish he sees lucys head
she makes a funny face
gru screams which causes lucy to scream and jump up hitting her head on one of the shelves sending all of the cupcakes flying
lucy immediately goes into action using incredible and frankly weird looking martial arts moves to dispatch the cupcakes as they fly toward her
ay ay ay ay ay
she successfully eliminates all of the cupcakes then turns to gru out of breath
wasnt expecting that
strikes a martial arts pose or was i
gru has a cupcake stuck to the top of his head frosting side down
lucy gestures as if hes got a little food on his face
the cupcake slowly slides down then falls to the floor
it leaves a long smear on grus face
here ill ill get it
gru stands frozen as she tries to clean him up
oh thats just spreading
i got it
i got it
lucy backs off
ill let you get it
gru sighs and wipes the frosting off his face
yeah what you just saw there was a little something new ive been working on
its a combination of jujitsu krav maga aztec warfare and krumping
okay thats weird why are you here
on assignment from silas
im your new partner
no no yay
ramsbottom didnt say anything about a partner
well seems that because of your checkered past everyone else refused to work with you
but not me
i stepped up
and im new so i kind of have to do what they tell me anyway
gru is about to respond when dave the minion comes out the kitchen door
he carries a cupcake in the shape of a minion
immediately lucy moves with lightning quick reflexes
she smashes his cupcake flips him into the air and pins him to the counter
you know this guy
yes hes one of my minions
oh im sorry
i should have known
she releases him
youre free to go
dave stares at lucy
a magical glow appears around her as romantic music plays
we go into daves fantasy
dave and lucy run along a beach together hand in hand
dave and lucy have a romantic picnic together
they toast each other with champagne
dave drinks from the bottle
lucy and dave sit on the railing of a moonlit footbridge
both fire rockets into the air to create fireworks and are about to kiss when dave
back to reality where dave is staring up at lucy lovestruck
earth to dave
you can leave now
dave goes back into the kitchen never taking his eyes off of lucy
close on the giant cupcake on top of the cupcake shop
the cherry on the giant cupcake rotates revealing a camera hidden inside
the lens zooms
now what do we got
whos on the list
fire em at me
gru and lucy stand next to each other under a domed lamp lowered from the ceiling
inside the dome of the lamp gru and lucy are uncomfortably close together looking at a video screen
hedda blumentoft proprietor of mums the word floral shop
the camera moves over to mums the word floral shop and hedda no
okay moving on
the camera moves over to the stuff a bear store
chuck kinney a small perky man holds up an empty teddy bear skin for a little boy
chuck kinney owner of stuff a bear
kinney shoves the teddy bears butt onto a sharp metal tube
the bear inflates until it explodes into a torrent of bear skin and stuffing
the little boy cries
i dont think so
ding a ling a ling
the bell rings on the cupcake shops front door signaling a customer
gru and lucy quickly hide their equipment look up and see eduardo perez at the door
they try to act natural
buenos dias my friends
i am eduardo perez owner of salsa salsa restaurant across the mall
now open for breakfast
and you are
and this is lucy
and we are closed
this is just gonna take un momento
i am throwing a big cinco de mayo party and i am going to need two hundred of your best cupcakes decorated with the mexican flag
it looks something like this
he rips open his shirt revealing a tattoo of the mexican flag on his chest
what do you think
he flexes and makes it wave
gru hides his eyes
lucy stares at it
anyway i have to go
its all settled
i pick em up next week
have a good day
come by if you get a chance okay
gru groans relieved
then eduardo pops back in
and welcome to the mall family
gru studies eduardos face and gasps
he pictures eduardo in a red luchador mask surrounded by flames
eduardo turns and leaves
as soon as the door closes whispers el macho
but it couldnt be
what couldnt be
that guy looks exactly like a villain named el macho
from about twenty years ago
classic spaghetti western sepia toned shot of el macho looking menacing
he looks like the large hispanic man from the mall only younger and wearing a lucha libre outfit and mask a mask which looks similar to the one gru imagined
el macho pushes the barkeep out of the way and grabs a large bottle from behind the bar
he was ruthless
he was dangerous
and as the name implies very macho
el macho pours himself a shot and then smashes the bottle over his own head
he reaches down and pulls up a rattlesnake from below the bar
he squeezes its head squirting venom into the shot glass
he drinks it down and then eats the glass
he sticks the snakes fangs into a few dollars that he leaves on the bar before breaking through the wall behind him leaving an el macho shaped hole
el macho head butts an armored truck and approaches the passenger side window
he had a reputation for pulling off heists using only his bare hands
when the armed guards look over he punches through the bullet proof glass knocking them both out of the truck
then he lifts the truck onto his back and runs down the street with it
ah but sadly like all the greats el macho was gone too soon
a bird flying in the air is suddenly struck by an airplane
he died in the most macho way possible
el macho leaps out of the plane riding a shark a ton of dynamite strapped to him
he plummets toward the mouth of an riding a shark with pounds of dynamite strapped to his chest into the mouth of an active volcano
he pulls two grenades from behind his back yanks the pins and holds onto them as he plunges into the volcano
there is a massive explosion
it was glorious
lucy stares at gru confused
yeah sounds like el machos pretty dead
they never found the body
all that was ever retrieved was a pile of singed chest hair
it has got to be el macho
lucy gets an excited look on her face
then what do you say you and i break into his restaurant
gru nods at lucys invitation
yes thats good because im telling you if anybody in this place has the px serum
gru looks out the window and points at eduardo riding up on the escalator scratching his butt
gru enters and pushes the girls into their beds like a tour guide anxious to finish a tour
alright alright homework done pajamas on teeth brushed time for bed
whats the big hurry
i have a lot of work to do
work what kind of work
very important business
hugs and kisses them good night sleep tight dont let the bedbugs blah blah blah blah blah gru turns to leave but agnes is standing at the doorway
but you said youd help me practice my part for the mothers day show
gru looks down at agnes puppy dog eyes
let me hear it
she gives her lines
robotically she kisses my boo boos she braids my hair my mother is beyond compare we love you mothers everywhere
i really liked the way you smiled at the end
lets try this one more time but a teensy bit less like a zombie okay
still monotone she kisses my boo boos she braids my hair perfect
time to go
as he heads for the door i dont think i should do this
this stops gru
well what do you mean
i dont even have a mom
but gru tries not to let this affect him
well you dont need one to do the show
i mean you did the veterans day pageant and you havent been in combat
agnes looks up at gru
this is different
okay well then
maybe you can just use your imagination
you mean i pretend i have a mom
you can do that cant you
i do that all the time
she gives him a kiss and runs off
gru watches her go deep in thought
two minions raise their ice cream sundaes and clink them together
pull back to reveal many minions singing and dancing
we move through the crowd passing by the mace wielding minion with his helmet still backwards and a smaller server minion with a tray of ice cream sundaes in mugs
we cut up to the rafters where more minions are dancing and singing in formation jumping and hopping all over the place in elaborate dance routines
back on the floor three arm in arm minions take the chorus
one of them clearly having had one too many sundaes is being held up by the other two
another minion tries to carry empty mugs down a spiral staircase but hes knocked off by a bunch of minions running up the other way
several minions sit around a communal bowl of ice cream lazily sipping at it through long straws
gru enters and takes it all in
other minions raid an ice cream cart hanging from the canopy drinking directly from the spouts
alright hey hey no no no no
the minions stop singing
kevin jerry watch the girls for me okay
points dave stuart come this way
dave downs a jar of maraschino cherries and sprays whip cream into his mouth before running after them with a toothpick umbrella in his mouth for good measure
once they are gone the minions go back to singing and laughing
margo edith and agnes are fast asleep in their beds
kevin and jerry sing them a lullaby
then smile and quietly close the door
kevin holds up a golf ball
jerry happily jumps up and down
hey putt putt
jerry puts the tee and ball in his mouth as kevin stands on a dresser preparing to take a swing
he asks jerry if hes ready and jerry gives a thumbs up
una doo laughs as he lowers the golf club to jerrys head crash
a noise comes from the backyard
the minions exchange looks
what was that
kevin and jerry step out into the yard and look around nervously armed only with the golf club and tee
they walk over to the garbage cans
the cans begins to rattle
kevin and jerry scream as a cat pops up from one of the cans
the cat meows
kevin laughs at him and imitates jerrys scared face
jerry slaps him
kevin slaps him back
they start to slap fight until a spotlight comes down from above lighting up the terrified minions
before they can scream
jerry is sucked up into the air as if being abducted by aliens
kevin grabs onto a flower and then the cat to try and anchor himself down but they both fly up into the air
the light goes out
a few seconds later the light comes back on and drops the cat back down
it turns off again and the minions are gone
the mall is dark and the parking lot is empty except for two minions and lucys car
a lone security guard walks through the dark mall listening to music on his headphones
he passes by eduardos salsa salsa
shines his light inside
he moves on
once the guard is gone a floor tile is moved aside and gru peeks out
after making sure the coast is clear gru calls down
whispers were stealth ninjas
we make no sound
lucy kicks the door open
alright el macho youre going down
but before gru takes a step lucy stops him
she produces a spray can and sprays the air in front of her
what are you doing
im checking for laser beam alarm triggers
its a restaurant
you never know what kind of booby traps this guy could have set
there are no booby traps
gru takes a step and kicks a tripwire attached to a tiny bell
ting a ling
lucy points to the bell
lucy gasps as a door begins to creak open
she hides behind gru
a tiny chicken hops out
lucy is confused
theres a chicken
are you lost little guy
you must be lost
some guard dog
suddenly the chicken leaps into the air and lands on gru pecking his bald head
gru runs in circles trying to get the chicken off
get it off of me
get it off of me
get it off of me
gru screams as the chicken goes up his shirt and bursts out of his sweater through the chest alien style
he grabs it
i got you
it pecks him on the head escapes and continues to attack him
lucy thinks fast and grabs a tablecloth from a table
she lunges and covers the chicken with the table cloth
i got it
she tightens the tablecloth around grus neck trapping the chicken and grus head inside
a muffled scream comes from under the table cloth and lucy realizes what shes done
gru runs around trying to get the tablecloth off his head
lucy does a karate flip body slam on gru and the chicken
she removes the table cloth
grus head has been replaced by the chicken
she goes to karate chop the chicken but it flies off and she hits gru in the face instead
the chicken regroups clucks and attacks
lucy acts fast and presses a button on her watch squirting foam onto the chicken
the foam instantly hardens into a glass ball around the chicken
only its head sticks out
it wobbles back and forth like a weeble
lucy turns to gru
what is wrong with that chicken
beat hey that pollo
gru is unimpressed
noticing grus wounds no
okay lets go
gru and lucy step into the kitchen
lucy pulls out a high tech scanning device and aims it around the kitchen
you getting anything
but hey maybe you can find something with these x ray goggles
lucy produces a pair of high tech goggles
gru shakes his head
gru puts them on and looks around the kitchen
we now see the room from his x ray pov
howre they working
tell me tell me
gru turns to lucy and sees her as a skeleton
oh thats an image ill never get out of my brain
gru makes a face disturbed
then quickly turns away and spots something behind a painting on the wall
sees something inside it a metal canister
i knew it
he goes to the wall and removes the painting revealing the the serum is in here
ooh then lets get it
he produces a safe cracking device and places it over the combination wheel
lights blink and it goes to work
gleefully giggling oh this is going to be good
the safe opens revealing a jar of salsa eduardos a ha
registering its not the serum what
disappointed awww man
eduardo enters the restaurant
senses something isnt right
somebodys going to die tonight
he cautiously walks through the restaurant
sees the chicken in the ball of cement
eduardo runs over to pollito and picks him up
whatd they do to you
can you hear me
who would do this to such a sweet little chicken
his eyes darken
gru and lucy who are ravenously eating the delicious salsa with chips turn to the door
eduardo carrying the chicken makes his way to the kitchen
grabs a large knife off of a table
you coming out
or am i gonna go in
gru and lucy react to hearing eduardos voice
gru pulls a laser cutter out of his jacket
aims it at the ceiling
the laser fires cutting a hole in the ceiling
eduardo approaches the kitchen brandishing the knife
ready to confront any intruders
he shoves open the door and sees chips and the salsa container sitting in the open wall safe
eduardo enters the room just in time to see a pair of legs disappear into the ceiling
lucy quickly pops down and hits him in the eyes with her foam shooting watch
he rubs his eyes dropping the chicken and cracking its encasement
lucy and gru quickly run through the mall
gru call one of your munchkins
gru produces a communicator and calls into it
weve been spotted
come get us
one minion sits on the hood of the car
the other leans against a tire toothpick in his mouth
to the other minion hey
loo koo meow plah
the car crashes through the glass doors and speeds through the mall
they crash into a bunch of cleaning supplies being pushed by a janitor
gru and lucy watch them from the balcony above
they both run over to meet the car at the escalators
the car heads for the escalators
as they reach the bottom gru and lucy realize the minions are about to go up the other one
over here over here
the minions shake as they go up the bumpy stairs
once they reach the top they take a left and start driving in circles around the balcony
gru pulls out a grappling hook and aims for the balcony railing
grabbing lucy hold tight
they shoot up and land right back where they started at salsa salsa
the minions zoom by in the car and gru sighs in exasperation
just then eduardo emerges from the restaurant with fire in his eyes and a knife in his hand
eduardo produces many more knives and heads straight for them
i have you now
eduardo is struck unconscious by lucys car
just in time
lucy opens the car door
one of the minions holds a toothpick in his hand and leans on the steering wheel seductively
the other minion revs the engine suggestively
eduardo starts to wake up
the car zooms past him
lucys car plummets towards the ground
gru screams hysterically but lucy just hits a button and the car transforms into a jet
they fly off into the night sky
its a beautiful morning
an ice cream truck makes its way down the street playing the song the minions were singing earlier
it stops and a couple of children run to meet it
stuart opens grus front door having heard the commotion
two other minions approach as well
stuart spots the ice cream truck and points to it excited
and then suddenly a mob of minions appears running for the ice cream truck alongside the group of children
the minions shove the children aside and clamor around the truck holding out their money
stuart pushes himself to the top of the unruly pack and tries to maintain order
a hush comes over the minions
knocking on the truck hey ho
suddenly the ice cream cone on top of the truck transforms into a large tube and extends itself above the minions
stuart offers the tube a wad of cash and attempts to order gelato but the it begins sucking the minions into it
one by one the minions dozens of them including the minion with his head still trapped in the jelly jar are sucked into the truck until there is only one
he tries to make a break for it but the truck lowers a popsicle in front of him
he licks it his tongue sticks and he is yanked back into the ice cream cone
the it closes and the truck drives away
the children look on puzzled
the hole that lucys car crashed through last night has been patched with plywood boards
pull back to reveal that gru is inside a garbage can disguise
next to him is lucy also in a garbage can disguise using binoculars
all right there he is
suspect floyd eaglesan
floyd eaglesan attempts to entice a customer to visit his business eagle hair club
see if you can get closer
gru quickly stands up revealing his legs and takes several steps toward eagle hair club
floyd looks over his shoulder and gru stops
floyd enters eagle hair club and gru inches closer
alright what do suddenly a man approaches the trash can with a steaming cup of coffee
the binoculars readout says warning
extremely to himself oh no
thats not good
the man goes to throw the coffee in the trash and we see grus legs pop out from beneath the can
the man looks confused and tries again
gru dodges and takes off running
the man chases after him
gru accidentally knocks into a bent over womans rear end
insulted she turns around sees the man with the coffee and slaps him across the face
unfortunately gru doesnt see the escalator ahead and goes tumbling down the moving stairs
finally gru pops out of the trash can and lands at the bottom of the escalator with a thud
flat on his face he hears a familiar voice call out
gru looks up and sees margo edith and agnes
what are you doing here
well we thought wed come visit you at work
looks at gru and the trash can so youre saving the world in a garbage can
sarcastically ha ha ha ha ha
lucy arrives on the scene joining them
hey there you are
oh whos this
lucy these are my girls margo edith and agnes
agnes gazes lovingly at lucy
a magical glow appears around lucy who smiles back
are you single
gru immediately uncomfortable claps his hands together
i have an idea
since lucy and i have lots of work to do why dont you girls go and explore the mall
gru quickly shuffles the girls away from lucy trying to get out of the uncomfortable situation
gru pulls out his wallet
here is some money
go buy some useless mall junk
some headbands and are you gonna marry lucy
are you out of your gourd
she just works with me
plus you love her
sings you love her you love her you really really love her and youre gonna get married and i will be the flower girl and okay stop
that is a song of lies
i dont even like her
points to mall now go have fun
the girls run off but quickly return to hug gru
good luck saving the world
lucy watches the group hug
gru heads back over to lucy embarrassed by agnes
ha ha ha
those girls totally adore you
i bet youre a fun dad
beat i am pretty fun
the girls are at the mall fountain
agnes has her eyes closed and a very intense look on her face as if shes really concentrating on something
there is something in her tightly clenched fist
she tosses a penny
then opens her eyes waiting for her wish to come true
then edith emerges from the water wearing a diving mask and snorkel hands full of coins
is that stealing
not if my wish was that i would get a lot of free coins
margo is busy texting
then something offscreen catches her eye
its a boy
this is antonio
suave cool and a bit dangerous
we watch in slow motion as he strolls behind the fountain and then disappears in its spraying water
margo looks for antonio
backs into the fountain and nearly falls into it
antonio catches her
margo chuckles nervously
he helps her back up
i was just going to get a cookie
care to join me
they begin walking away together then margo is reminded of her sisters when edith loudly clears her throat
ill catch up with you guys later
she turns and runs after antonio
can i be the first to say
agnes grabs edith and shakes her
we gotta go tell gru
gru approaches eagle hair club
all right im going in
if it picks up any traces of the serum the sensor in your belt buckle gru activates the high tech scanning device on his belt buckle
lucy is in the cupcake shop monitoring the scanning device results
she can hear him and see from his pov
will make a sound like this mee annoyed okay
i get it
i get it
gru fumbles with the automatic door then enters eagle hair club
chuckles welcome to eagle hair club
at the reception desk a large chair shaped like an eagle spins around
sitting in the chair is floyd looking sinister and petting a furry object that looks like a cat
its about time you showed up
his pet bald eagle perched next to him squawks
know my name
chuckles when someone moves into the mall who is follically challenged i make it my business to know all about them
you are bald
and that is bad
he strokes the furry object
then places it on a mannequin head
its a toupee
there you go my sweet
lucy monitors the chem tracking device from inside the shop
im getting nothing so far
i think you need to move around
gru listens in on the headphones
he steps over to a wall on which hangs a painting of floyd flying with eagles
wow this looks interesting
what is it
gru thrusts his hips at the painting
floyd watches him suspicious
i take it youre an art lover
yeah not so much
he walks over to a podium with a trophy
he thrusts his hips at that too
oh how about this impressive trinket
id hardly call it a trinket mr
in headphones nothing
the international yeah i dont care
floyd grumbles in frustration
gru moves to a shelf filled with wig samples
he straddles it
in headphones mee mo mee mo mee mo
im picking up something
behind that wall
and what do we have here
floyd grabs a sample
these are my trial wigs
holds out wig to gru you should take one
gru sticks his head into the shelf to investigate
so whats on the other side of the wall
here you are
look at me
in headphones gru
i promise that this wig will transform you from ugly to irresistible
gru stares at the wig
clearly getting caught up in what floyds saying
gru is about to respond when suddenly edith and agnes burst in out of breath
gru stares at them
yells at floyd what
gru edith and agnes race across the mall
then agnes points over to the salsa restaurant as margo and antonio walk in
there she goes
gru enters to see margo and antonio sitting together in the back of the restaurant together
margo laughs at something antonio said
oh youre so funny
look theyre in love
these words hit gru like a smack in the face
oh no no no
do not say that they are
no no no no
he storms in
edith and agnes follow
and my dream is to one day play video games for a living
youre so complicated
gru storms over to margo
attempts a smile
what is going on here
gru se llama antonio
me llamo margo
me llama lama ding dong who cares
salsa music begins to play and a curtain opens across the room
someone leaps out spinning like a tornado then lands in the middle of the restaurant with a flourish
everyone in the restaurant cheers
not this guy
the music continues and eduardo dances across the floor and out into the mall where he grabs a passing shopper and pulls her into the restaurant
the confused woman holds on for the ride as eduardo twirls and dances her all around the floor
he dips her and she melts as do all of the women watching
eduardo gazes into the womans eyes and produces a business card
kids eat free on tuesdays
the woman grabs the business card from his hand with her teeth
then eduardo flings her across the floor and she twirls back out into the mall where she knocks over her confused husband
then the song comes to an end and eduardo strikes a final pose
everyone in the studio cheers
everyone except gru
eduardo walks over to him and gives him a big warm hug
so good to see you again mi compadre
gru tries to get out of the hug as quickly as he can
oh i see you have already met my father
what the father
look at this crazy small world we live in eh
come sit let me get you something
gru looks down and sees eduardos chicken glaring at him
look at you
eduardo scoops the chicken up
he likes me
gru tries to pet the chicken but pollito lunges at him
oh oh im sorry pollito is usually very friendly
cradling pollito he had a rough night
the chicken stares relentlessly
gru chuckles nervously
well we really should be going
girls come on
gru tries to gather the girls but eduardo stops him pushing antonio and margo closer together
that is a pity
young love is beautiful no
chuckling nervously you know theyre not in love
they hardly know each other
eduardo suddenly lights up having an idea
you are right cabeza de huevo
they must get to know each other better
antonio why dont you invite your girlfriend and her family to our cinco de mayo party
no no i am si
the girls are all thrilled at this as is antonio
as if on cue music begins playing and they all begin dancing together
antonio takes margos hand and twirls her across the floor
gru stares at antonio with a look that could kill
a waiter comes by to give gru a party drink and he promptly crushes the glass with his bare hands
his eye twitches
gru and lucy sit across from silas at headquarters
im sorry el macho
hadnt we eliminated him as a suspect
after the whole salsa incident
yes but there has been a new development and im telling you this is the guy
you need to arrest him immediately
and his deviously charming son
im pretty sure that the son is involved too
the son also
youve got to get the son
gru approaches silas
whispers i think that the son is the mastermind
theres a look
theres a devilish look in his eyes and i dont like it
yes but i dont really see any evidence for evidence schmevidence
i go with my gut and my gut tells me that this guy is el macho
lock him up
lock up the son
dont forget about the son
the kid gives me the creeps
silas takes a deep breath and rubs his temples
oh dear oh dear oh dear
lucy jumps in trying to save the situation
uh but on the less
whistles crazy side of things uh gru discovered traces of the serum at eagle hair club
yeah and you know who made that happen
points to gru this guy
i mean sure but its not him
whispers el macho
it is him
and i will prove it
and gru storms out
calls after him gru cmon
once hes gone silas gives lucy a look
laughs nervously he really thinks its el macho
can you tell
silas is not amused
the minion with the popsicle stuck to his tongue wakes up on a beach disoriented
he slowly sits up and sees hundreds of minions partying
this is where all the abducted minions were taken
there are minions sitting at a tiki bar being tended by a bartender minion
the french maid minion and a ukelele playing minion are dancing in the sand
they wave at him
meanwhile jerry approaches the popsicle minion with two bananas
he gives him one does a hawaiian dance with the other then runs off for the water
popsicle minion tears off his overalls and follows suit
the popsicle minion now nude runs across the sand and jumps into a clear blue ocean
we pull back to reveal that unbeknownst to any of the minions this is all happening inside a large terrarium and they are being watched by a mysterious figure in
gru sits with his laptop
hes on the evillain site
he clicks through various images of el macho
edith chases kevin who has the wig in his mouth
a minion sets a stack of magazines on the coffee table
then you are no longer connected to the internet appears on grus screen
he grimaces and calls out
kevin the wi fis out
he looks to the minion at the coffee table
where the heck is kevin
the minion just shrugs and walks away
alright we need to revisit the number of vacation days you guys get
i cant find anybody anymore
someones at the door
gru turns to it
gru pretends to shoot himself
ive got good news
jillian and her artificially beautiful friend shannon stand outside on grus porch
shannon texts on her phone looking bored
i have my friend shannon here with me
i was thinking you two could get some grub you know tear it up
see what happens
uhh open up
he sees agnes walking by singing softly and playing with her unicorn
he whisper shouts to her
tell jillian im not here
agnes turns to the door
grus not here
are you sure
he just told me
gru panicking shakes his head and wags his fingers
i mean no he didnt just tell me
laughs agnes where is gru
gru makes the zip your lips gesture
hes putting on lipstick
gru waves his arms
hes swatting at flies
gru waves his hand around his throat making a cut it off gesture
chopping his head off
gru clenches his fists and grunts in frustration
outside jillian and shannon look confused
i know youre in there gru
theres no way youre getting out of this
kyle enters the room carrying the bag with the wig in his mouth
shannon sits at a table talking to gru whos offscreen
a waiter drops off a plate of spaghetti
i have to tell you i was so nervous about tonight
i mean theres just so many phonies out there
cut to gru sitting across from her
wearing a ridiculous wig from floyd
and looking extremely uncomfortable
yes i hear you
awkwardly laughs oh so do you work out
i mean obviously you dont but would you consider it
physical fitness is very important to shannon
as you can tell right
shannon drops to the floor and starts doing push ups
i can tell
mid push up solid
she switches to one armed push ups
we are in a restaurant you know
gru looks even more uncomfortable
just then lucy unseen by gru enters the restaurant
she approaches the hostess
takeout for lucy
sure just a sec
the hostess leaves
lucy looks around and then spots gru
sees him with the wig and shannon who is now doing crunches on the floor
lucy narrows her eyes then has an idea
she presses a button on her watch which transforms into a high tech eavesdropping device and puts it in her ear
now shes able to hear gru and shannon talking
she watches them intrigued
shannon has returned to her seat
your accent is so exotic
well thank you very much
i was i know someone who can fix that for you
and youll be talking normal in no time
gru is starting to sweat
is it hot in here
hows the food
he wipes his brow and accidentally shifts the wig on his head
shannon stares at grus hair
wait a minute
wait a minute
are you wearing a wig
really sweating it what
readjusts the wig i dont think so
i knew it
youre a phony
i hate phonies
these locks are all mine
no theyre not
you know what im gonna do
im gonna rip that thing off your head and show everyone what a bald headed phony you are
i dont think so miss lady
lucy presses a button on her watch and a target sight pops out
gru watches in horror as shannon reaches across the table for the wig
quickly lucy presses another button on her watch which fires a mini dart gun at shannon
the mini dart goes into shannons butt knocking her out instantly
and saving gru from certain humiliation
gru stares at the now sleeping shannon confused
hello are you
gru quickly removes the wig
hello lucy how you doin
noticing shannon wow looks like your dates out for the count
its like shes been shot with a mild moose tranquilizer
shannon moans like a moose then passes out again
winks yeah im winking cuz thats what actually happened
an italian waiter approaches
re shannon scusi whassa happenin here
she no like
oh shes just uh makes drinking gesture the waiter nods and leaves
laughs oh oh si si
lucy turns to gru
shall we take her home
gru and lucy carry an unconscious shannon out of the restaurant
her head gets stuck in the swinging doors on the way out
they try to dislodge her and accidentally end up throwing her headfirst into a lamp post
they pick her up between them weekend at bernies style
they wave to a passing cop
the cop tips his hat
gru and lucy get in her car
but its cramped with shannon in there too
she doesnt really fit
lucys car drives down the street
gru and lucy now have plenty of room in the car
we boom up to see that shannon has been strapped to the roof like a deer
gru and lucy arrive at shannons house
lucy comes to an abrupt stop and shannon flies off the roof and slams into the car in front of them
gru and lucy sit on the front steps of shannons house
well i think you did it
you just officially had the worst date ever
huh tell me about it
dont worry it can only get better from here right
but if it doesnt you can always borrow my dart gun
ive had to use it on one or two dates myself
yeah you know as far as dates go i think im good with just the one
gru and lucy exchange looks
he chuckles nervously
time to go
well good night partner
she pats his shoulder and walks toward her car
gru gets up to walk beside her
this was fun
surprisingly it was
oh and uh just between you and me
you look much better bald
they smile at each other and she gives him a peck on the cheek and walks away
see you tomorrow
gru smiles a big smile
shannon slumps over on the porch behind him
could he be
falling in love
grus alarm clock goes off
he reaches out and turns it off
ready to greet the day
gru happily washes in the shower acting out a puppet show with his rubber ducky
gru brushes his teeth with two toothbrushes
he jokingly arranges them in his mouth like walrus tusks then barks like a seal
heart shaped pancakes are served to the girls sitting at the table
edith makes a face at getting hers
so i take it the date went well
it was horrible
he laughs gleefully
the girls exchange looks
then he skips out of the room dancing with a minion in the kitchen
agness face lights up
gru makes his way to work on foot he strolls down the sidewalk
he passes a mailman and gives him a high five
then a policeman with whom he exchanges mimed gunfire
then a nun with whom he bumps rumps
seeing something offscreen gru gasps
he stops traffic so a happy family of ducks can cross the street
he plays ultimate frisbee with a bunch of college kids balancing the spinning disc on his pointy nose
he joins a group of old ladies doing tai chi
he air drums with a couple of bucket drummers on the curb
he picks a flower then walks by a man and a woman sitting alone with their backs to each other at a cafe
he quickly turns their chairs around so they find each other and hands the man the flower for the woman
they smile and gru goes his merry way
gru continues happily dancing through the mall on his way to the cupcake shop
he shimmies with a fat woman on the escalator then gaps and stops suddenly upon seeing eagle hair club closed
the music abruptly ends
gru sees silas speaking with an avl agent
gru approaches him
what are you doing here
we got him
our agents located a secret room in his shop last night and uh discovered this
he snaps his fingers and an avl agent hands him a metal canister in a ziploc bag
silas holds it up
its empty but we found traces of the px serum in it
hes our man
so somehow in spite of your incompetence we solved this one
two avl agents carry floyd away in handcuffs
i was framed
you wont get away with this
get your mitts off of me
i am a legitimate businessman
gru turns back to silas
he is stunned by this
well now youre free to go back to your business
jams and jellies
and it looks like agent wilde will be transferring to our australian branch
in shock australia
but thank you for everything
and by everything of course i mean
beat toodle pip and cheerio mr
silas walks away to join the avl agents
gru stares blankly sadly
and then lucy approaches him
we got him
beat and now youre going to australia
well its not definite yet
still figuring it out
already been working on my accent
australian accent wallaby
i wanted to give you this
she holds out her lipstick taser
your lipstick taser
yeah its just a memento
just you know from the first time we met
thank you lucy
gru accepts the lipstick taser
lucy ignores this and just waits not wanting to leave
she and gru stand there awkwardly
it looks like they need you so
yeah i uh i better go
and she leaves gru
he stands there
gru walks back home completely depressed
walks past the college kids playing frisbee
catches the frisbee and tosses it down the sewer
walks past the group of bucket drummers
as he passes he kicks one of the buckets
walks past the old ladies doing tai chi
as they balance on one leg he pushes them all and they all fall over
its pouring rain
gru sits alone outside his house
and then an umbrella approaches him
it looks like its traveling on its own
but when it gets closer it lifts up revealing agnes
i brought you an umbrella
gru takes the umbrella and agnes joins him
they both huddle under it
ah thank you
whatre you doing out here
remember when you said that i liked lucy
well it turns out
agness face lights up
well shes moving away
sadly im never going to see her again
agness face falls
all her hopes and dreams shattered
but she tries to encourage gru
is there anything i can do to help
oh i dont i dont think so sweetheart
well is there anything you could do
gru is on the phone
this is gru
i know up to this point our relationship has been strictly professional and youre leaving for australia and all but
struggles to get it out okay here is the question
would you like to to go out on a date
pull back to reveal dave the minion standing across from gru pretending to be on a cell phone on the other end of the line
and wearing a red haired wig
okay thats not helping
he hangs up
here we go
for real this time
he stares at lucys card
then turns to the phone
its a stand off
he does stretches and calisthenics to psych himself up
i can do this
he stares down the phone again
it sits there taunting him
we cut back and forth between gru and the phone until finally agh
i hate you
he produces a flamethrower and burns up the phone
dave dives out of the way
the fire alarm goes off
suddenly axes chop through the wall
several minions in firemens gear enter
another minion imitates a siren through a bullhorn
one continues chopping everything in sight with his axe then chops his way right through the wall of the house and falls outside
another minion brings in a massive hose turns it on and goes flying around the room as it whips around like a snake
dave tests out a fire extinguisher
gru takes away the bullhorn from the siren minion
but he keeps on making the noise
dave fires the extinguisher at the siren minion
he makes the noise again and dave sprays him with the fire extinguisher sending him flying offscreen
the minions enjoy another day at the beach
kevin the golf minion drifts out in the water on an inner tube
he fixes his coconut bra then unpeels a banana and eats it
a hand pulls a lever in a control room
suddenly a whirlpool appears in the water right next to him
he gets sucked into it
kevin is pulled down to the bottom of the habitat and into a kevin pops out of the tube and lands in a waiting metallic chair
his hat follows him down the tube and lands on his head
a metal strap fastens around his waist
he shrugs and continues to eat the banana
kevin looks over and sees the french maid minion strapped into a chair nearby
he has a banana too
they raise their bananas in the air
and then a giant device appears looking like a huge scary hypodermic needle filled with purple liquid
the needle comes toward the french maid minion
to the needle compai
the needle is injected into him and administers the serum
the french maid minion starts to shake
then morphs into a purple minion
kevin points and laughs at him
he doesnt see the needle come down behind him
it injects him with the serum as well
grus vehicle makes its way up the winding road to eduardos house
gru drives the vehicle looking deeply depressed
the girls sit in the back dressed up for the cinco de mayo party
cinco de may yay yo
cinco de may yay yo
cinco de may yay yo
grus expression doesnt change
they pull up to the front gate
grus vehicle pulls up in front of the open gate in front of eduardos house
his car almost knocks a bunch of parked cars off the cliff
the grounds are set up for the most elaborate and fun cinco de mayo party of all time
sumptuous spreads of mexican food everywhere
lanterns hanging from trees
people having a great time
gru and the girls enter the compound
this place is awesome
but first lets go over the rules
because what is fun without the rules
on agnes with her mouth and arms full of churros
agnes easy on the churros
on edith swinging her ninja sword
edith try not to kill anyone
margo as gru turns to margo he sees that she is holding hands with antonio face to face almost close enough to kiss
gru furrows his brow
he grabs antonio and drags him far away from margo
there must be the standard six feet of space between you and boys
re antonio especially this boy
gru turns and sees that antonio is back next to margo
laughs you are a funny man
there are no rules senor
its cinco de mayo
to girls come on
theyre starting the dance
he grabs margos hand and takes off
edith and agnes follow
agnes explodes with delight
rolling her r like crazy arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrriba
gru watches them go
gru sneaking through the party spots antonio and margo dancing
gru sneaks up on antonio using the flashing strobe lights to cover his approach
suddenly antonio is gone and gru is the one dancing with margo who has her back to him and is oblivious to whats going on
antonio reappears and kicks gru in the crotch from behind
he dances once again with margo while gru hunches over in pain
gru then gets the upper hand and starts choking antonio and shaking him
margo turns around and sees this
gru and antonio see they are being watched by margo and start casually dancing next to each other as if nothing is wrong
as the song ends margo takes antonios hand and pulls him away from gru off the dance floor
gru is defeated and all alone
gru sits by himself in the corner sulking and staring at lucys lipstick taser
a waiter walks by and places a tortilla chip sombrero on his head with the rim filled with guacamole
he breaks off a piece dips it and eats it
so glad you could make it mi compadre
gru looks up and sees eduardo standing there
gru quickly hides the taser
sensing somethings wrong hey whats wrong
nothing is wrong
im just chilling with the guac
from my chip hat
gru takes another scoop of guacamole smiles and gives a thumbs up
a glob of guacamole falls from the sombrero
eduardo puts his arm around him
i know that look all too well
it is the look of a broken heart
how did you know
believe me my friend i too have spent many nights trying to drown my sorrows in guacamole
but we are survivors
theres much more to us than meets the eye
enjoy the party
eduardo gives gru a meaningful look
and then walks away
gru watches him go
deep in thought
gru notices eduardo suspiciously sneak away from the party and head into the house
gru gets up from the table and follows eduardo
as he walks through the party several partygoers break tortilla pieces off his sombrero to eat
eduardo enters a dimly lit room
gru sneaks behind and peers through a crack in the door
eduardo stands in the center of a secret room which is lined with mayan style totem poles
he dances on the tile floor which lights up and plays la cucaracha with each strategic step
the musical pattern is a code which opens a secret passageway through the largest totems mouth
eduardo enters and the mouth closes behind him
gru tentatively enters the room
he pauses at the tile floor
he tries to replicate eduardos la cucaracha code but a glob of guacamole from his sombrero falls to the floor and hits the wrong tile
this activates a booby trapped totem pole which halves grus sombrero with a spear
what the oh
gru observes the destroyed sombrero in his hands
gru attempts the code again but missteps
an axe from the wall swings at him and misses
gru missteps again and one of the totems lights up and spits fire at him burning his face
he missteps again and a club whacks him over the head
one of the totems shoots darts at him piercing his nose
in pain aaaahhh
gru falls to the floor
his head hits the correct tile and the mayan passageway opens
gru walks to the door pointing at the totems and gloating
ha ha ha the passageway doors slam on his arm
in pain oh
he pulls his crushed arm through the doors
a jets through the sky
lucy sits alone and stares out the window
she she grabs an in flight magazine and opens it up to an ad for wristwatches
it reads in the sky he is the one man everyone can trust and shows a picture of gru giving the thumbs up in a cockpit
lucy reacts shakes her head and now the picture is just a regular airline pilot in the cockpit
lucy turns the page
its another ad saying simply gru now
and showing a picture of a muscular gru diving from a waterfall
she gasps and slams the magazine shut then slowly reopens it to find the picture is really just a random muscular guy diving
it says go now to hawaii
would you like some peanuts or pretzels
lucy looks up from her magazine to see the flight attendant who looks like gru
then looks across the aisle and sees a lady that looks and sounds like gru talking to another man who looks like gru
ha ha ha ha ha
thats a good joke
then lucy looks behind her and sees the young mother looks like gru
the baby turns around and also looks like gru
i just did a boom boom
the flight attendant tries to get lucys attention
i really need you to make a choice hon
close on lucy as she has a moment of epiphany
i choose gru
to everyone lucy runs to the exit door and flings it open
air rushes throughout the cabin
thank you gru stewardess
the flight attendant stands up recovering from her twirl
the other passengers wave as the planes oxygen masks fall from each overhead console
and with that lucy jumps from the plane holding her purse
as lucy falls from the sky she presses a button on her purse and it transforms into a hanglider
she flies off with purpose
elevator doors open revealing el machos underground lair
gru stands in the doorway pulling the dart out of his nose
the lair is a massive villainous complex that looks a lot like hell
gru takes the place in
its awesome and terrifying
the magnet ship is there
you have not lost your touch my friend
gru turns around and sees eduardo dressed in el machos old wrestling outfit like we saw in the flashback
i knew it
you are el macho
nobody believed me
but i knew you werent dead
laughing of course not
i merely faked my death ha ha
beat but now its time for me to make a spectacular return to evil
doctor i think its time we showed gru what were up to here
standing in the middle of the lairs walkway is the one the only
nice to see you gru
this so this is your new job opportunity
youre gonna like this
nefario pulls a lever
a platform rises with the purple minion version of kevin strapped to a chair on it
sorry i had to borrow some of your minions but it was for a worthy cause
no hes not kevin anymore
now he is an indestructible mindless killing machine
just watch this
he then presses a button
a machine gun lowers and the purple minions riddled with bullets but unhurt
a flamethrower shoots fire at the purple minion but hes completely unharmed
an axe is swung at him but he just eats it
an atom bomb falls on him but he just swallows it and it explodes harmlessly in his belly
a police car is dropped onto him and he devours it whole
gru stares stunned
and heres the best part
ive got an army of them
the lights come on above el macho revealing hundreds of caged purple minions
gru cant believe his eyes
el macho laughs
soon i will unleash them on the world and if anyone anyone tries to stop them
their city gets eaten
beat we can do it together
i have admired your work for years amigo
stealing the moon
are you kidding
we would be unstoppable
men like you men like me we should be ruling the world
excitedly so are you in
nefario pops a celebratory noisemaker in the background
el macho eagerly awaits grus reply
gru just stares at him
how does he get out of this
el macho is taken aback
gru realizes hes in danger and quickly tries to backpedal
i mean yes
of course yes i just have a lot going on right now
i just need to get some things off my plate before we start taking over the world thats all
no no forget it
one hundred percent
i am in
pretending to hear something i think what is do you hear that i do
thats agnes calling me from on the surf gru steps into the elevator and the door shuts
hes frantically trying to press the button that will return him to the surface
the doors close and gru is gone
el macho stares deep in thought
you know what
i am not so convinced that he is in
el macho presses a button that releases the purple minion
edith knocks a pinata down with a bat then beats the crap out of it
edith accidentally hits gru in the face with the bat
edith takes off her blindfold
we need to go home now
but i didnt get a turn
margo sits at a table alone and depressed wearing the chip hat
she looks like shes been crying
gru approaches her with the other girls in tow
come on were leav hey whats wrong
i hate boys
gru turns and sees antonio dancing with a pretty girl
sorry honey weve got to go
he takes her hand and leads her offscreen before popping back into frame and firing the freeze ray at antonio
we see he is now frozen in a block of ice
grus car pulls out of the driveway and speeds down the mountain just as lucys hang glider lands at eduardos
lucy looks around but doesnt see gru
she maneuvers her way through the crowd
she makes it through but still no sign of gru
suddenly pollito appears and exchanges looks with lucy
he screeches and flies towards her
she strikes a martial arts pose ready to defend herself
as she does her purse falls to the ground
the attack never comes and she looks down to see pollito pecking at her purse
whats the matter
el macho appears and picks up the chicken petting it
pollito hes usually not like this
the same thing happened the other day with
with gru and
el macho drops off deep in thought
connecting the dots
lucy is oblivious
oh speaking of gru
uh have you seen him
i really need to talk to him
yes i think hes somewhere around here
you two are close no
oh i dont know
i mean close
i wouldnt say we were close
why did he say we were close
did he say that
its more what he didnt say
for instance he never mentioned
that you were both working for the anti villain league
suddenly el macho turns pollito around revealing that he has her avl credentials in his beak
el macho grabs lucy
threateningly youre coming with me
he leads her away
we see dr
nefario watching this in shock
hes holding a drink and a mexican flag cupcake
the vehicle pulls into the driveway
gru walks the girls into the family room
two minions sit in front of the big screen tv playing a video game
so eduardos actually el macho
no it is not cool
plus i pretty much knew it was him all along so if anyones cool its me
the bigscreen tv beeps
gru and the others turn to look
hes at el machos whispering and looking anxiously around him from under a table
hurriedly el machos on to you
he knows youre working for the avl
and hes got your partner
gru is confused
wha thats impossible
shes on her way to australia
nefario looks nervously offscreen
el machos coming
sorry gotta go
nefario disconnects the camera
the screen goes blank
agnes gasps and turns to gru
hes got lucy
determined not for long
gru begins to walk out of the room
he turns to the minions
beat were getting her out of there
gru marches out of the room fire in his eyes
a man on a mission
to save the woman he loves
the minions are visibly disappointed to leave their video game
one of them clutches the controller in his hand and continues to play until the moment he exits the frame
gru gets on his motorcycle
its the grucycle a gru style motorcycle like arnold in terminator
a playhouse in grus front yard drops away revealing a hatch in the ground
out drives gru
two minions sit behind him holding on
he speeds down the road
ready to kick some butt
the yard is now filled with rocket ships
from behind we watch el macho emerge from his home to survey the troops
some minions file into the rocket ships
el macho watches them and laughs maniacally
evil minion pov the evil minion kevin runs down the street nearing grus house
he is scared by his own reflection in a shiny parked car
he spots a tricycle and eats it
then kyle spots him and growls
kyle runs off and evil minion kevin gives chase
he stops when he sees the front door
margo and agnes sit on the floor playing a princess board game
next to agnes is her unicorn
they hear a scratching sound outside the window
agnes looks scared
what was that
margo stands up
makes her way toward the window which is covered with drapes
then reaches a nervous hand and pulls back the drapes
i dont see anything
suddenly evil minion kevin appears at the window looking really scary
evil minion kevin crashes through the window and lands in the family room surrounded by shattered glass and tangled up in the curtain
he turns to the girls who slowly back away
he looks at agnes and roars
margo grabs agnes and they run out of the room accidentally dropping the stuffed unicorn behind
agnes stops and runs back for it
agnes stops and sees evil minion kevin already has it in his mouth
agnes screams a crazy high pitched scream
it shatters all the glass in the room including the glass in evil minion kevins goggles
he spits out the unicorn
he is slowed him down for a bit so agnes safely grabs the unicorn and margo grabs agness hand
they run for the elevator to the lower level with the purple minion hot on their tails
the elevator drops just in time
evil minion kevin slams into the glass door
margo and agnes run into the lab to find half a dozen minions milling about
edith plays ping pong with the minions using nun chucks like bruce lee
margo shuts the big iron door
edith and the minions stare back at margo
whats the matter
the purple minion has eaten its way through the ceiling
it drops down into the lab and lands on a dazed yellow minion
the girls scream as it jumps up and dashes towards them
evil minion kevin stomps toward the girls
they are backed into a corner
its all over
then suddenly a hypodermic needle enters frame and injects evil minion kevin
he falls over writhing on the floor
then he sits up and has turned back into a yellow minion
ooh la la
the other minions dog pile on him with friendly hugs
nefario holding the needle
in the flesh
nefario produces a vial filled with yellow liquid
behold the antidote
he walks over to a vat of the jelly
lets finally put this horrible jelly to some good use
he pours the antidote into the vat
gru makes his way up the road leading to el machos house
he is wearing handcuffs and being led at spear point by dave and stuart who have been painted purple to look like evil minions
but they are goofing around and giggling
and they still have a few yellow spots
stay focused here
the minions somber up
gru covers a smeared yellow spot with purple paint
they approach the front gate which is closed
dave boosts himself onto a stray box and speaks gibberish into the intercom
he hears evil minion gibberish in response
he responds back in evil minion gibberish
the intercom buzzes and the gate begins to open
the gate opens and there are dozens of purple minions milling about
they eye gru and his captors suspiciously
dave and stuart poke gru with a spear
attempting to act curses
these guys captured me
the evil minions cheer at seeing this
gru dave and stuart have to walk all the way to the house surrounded on all sides by evil purple minions
the painted yellow minions are very nervous
the purple minions eye them as they pass
they growl and the yellow minions attempt to growl back
its extremely intense but it looks like theyre going to make it
then one of the evil minions makes a slobbery raspberry at one of the painted ones
they get into a raspberry fight until the painted minion is grossed out and tries to rub the slobber off him
it rubs off the purple paint
one of the evil purple minions points and screams
all of the purple minions run towards gru dave and stuart
ready to chomp
they take off running
gru and the yellow minions burst into el machos backyard
the evil minions give chase
up that tree
they climb a tree up to the roof of the house only to be pursued by more minions up there
and the evil minions have devoured the tree so they cant go back that way either
with no escape gru and the minions run up a tower until they reach the top a dead end
here come the purple minions
gru kicks them away and the yellow minions try to fight off the purple ones
but they are clearly doomed
and then grus ship appears hovering above them
modified as a jelly dispensing weapon and with dr
nefario at the controls
the minions hang on the sides holding jelly the ship opens fire on the evil minions transforming them
one by one they transform back into yellow minions
one of the minions wipes the horrible tasting jelly off his tongue
nefario sticks his head out the side of the ship
nice work dr
gru leaps onto the ship
i put an antidote in the jelly
beat i mean im happy to create an evil army to destroy the world but nobody messes with my family
thank you doctor
now lets go get the gru looks over to see margo edith and agnes onboard the ship holding jelly blasters
gru is flabbergasted
he turns to nefario
you brought the girls
was that wrong
grus ship flies toward el macho blasting purple minions all along the way
from behind a large jelly gun edith unloads round after round
el macho witnesses his evil minions being converted back to regular ones
whats happening to my minions
gru turns to nefario and the girls
you guys take care of the rest of the minions
beat im going to find lucy
gru leaps out of the ship down to the roof el macho is on
he has two big jelly weapons in his hands
meanwhile the ship flies off with its jelly blasters firing and comes to land on the ground below
the minions and the girls start jumping from the ship
agnes takes aim
eat jelly you purple freaks
agnes gun is a little too big for her and the kick sends her a bit out of control
but she still manages to hit a number of evil minions
the tide is turning
meanwhile gru has gone ballistic on the evil minions
he takes the remaining few out
el macho kicks an evil minion at gru but he manages to hit it with jelly and transform it back to yellow
gru holds his gun up to el macho and gives him a threatening look
its over el macho
now where is lucy
chuckles let me show you
he turns to a computer and pushes a button
a fountain stops spewing water and underneath it steel doors open from the ground
and out of them rises a rocket
strapped to it is lucy
tied to a shark with two hundred and fifty pounds of dynamite strapped to her
gru is horrified
oh hey gru
turns out you were right about the whole el macho thing huh
el macho calls to gru brandishing a remote
one push of this button and i send that rocket straight into the same volcano where i faked my death
only this time its for real
dave swoops in on a rope and grabs the remote tarzan style
but unfortunately he smacks a roof support and drops the remote
it bonks a bunch of minions on the head and lands on the ground
el macho stares down gru
fire in his eyes
we couldve ruled the world together gru
but now youre gonna die
he pulls out a vial of px and drinks it
el macho transforms into a giant purple furry creature
he gru pulls the trigger on his jelly gun but he is out of ammunition
he then pulls out the freeze ray and fires encasing el machos fists in blocks of ice
el macho growls and slams his fists to the ground shattering the ice and knocking gru off the platform and onto a scaffolding
gru the scaffolding tips over
el macho grabs the scaffolding and holds it above his head ready to crush gru
suddenly gru pulls out lucys lipstick taser and fires it at purple el macho
the jolt of electricity has him shaking and dancing and ultimately sizzling and smoking until he finally collapses on the ground
lucy smiles at this
he copied me
gru runs off to save her
the minions surround el macho cocking their jelly guns
dazed i am not afraid of your jelly guns
oh this aint a jelly gun sunshine
nefario fires the fart gun directly into el machos face causing him to pass out
the minions cheer firing their jelly guns into the air
one of the minions stands on top of el macho and poses for a big game hunter style photo
nefario smiles for the camera as well
gru runs toward the rocket
dont worry about me gru
ill be fine
i have survived lots worse than this
beat okay thats not entirely true
im actually kind of freaking out up here
dont worry i will get you out of this
gru attempts to untie lucy
and then sees pollito has walked over to the remote
gru and lucy gasp
the chicken looks at gru and lucy then pecks the button
i really hate that chicken
the rocket blasts off into the air
the minions and girls watch in horror as gru and lucy fly off on the rocket
gru uses his knife to cut lucys ropes
they scream as the shark gets loose and falls down to a sushi bar below where all of the customers and sushi chef cheer
meanwhile on the rocket gru rips a panel off the side revealing a mess of wires inside
is there a red one
its usually the red one
gru starts to pull out wires left and right
to no avail
gru anytime now
gru gasps realizing they are approaching the volcano
time is running out
death is imminent
he looks lucy in the eyes
listen lucy we may not get out of this alive so i need to ask you a question
uh better make it quick
if id asked you out on a date what would you have said
are you kidding me
then realizes that the rocket is still careening toward the volcano
he grabs lucy
gru and lucy grab hands and leap off the rocket
the rocket plunges into the volcano
gru and lucy plummet through the air
the volcano explodes in a massive tempest of fire and smoke and lava
the impact of the blast hits gru and lucy and sends them flying
they hit the water
the volcano continues exploding
gru emerges soaking and out of breath
fire and lava flying all around him
he cant find lucy
looks around panicking lucy
where are you
after a few moments lucy also emerges
gru is incredibly relieved
lucy smiles and hugs gru
they both go underwater
then come back up
and in love
i guess you kind of need your arms to tread water huh
the minions appear in the rowboat
but they pass right by them
theyll be back
romantic music plays under the title card
four minions dressed in matching suits begin to sing a all ones i swear pronounced underwear in minionese
we are at gru and lucys wedding reception
we pull back to the wedding cake and then to gru and lucy dancing
as they dance we see all of the wedding guests watching grus mom dr
nefario silas jillian shannon natalie etc
gru dips lucy and they attempt their kiss but their noses keep bumping
they finally manage to kiss and the crowd we see the three girls watching in their beautiful bridesmaid dresses
agnes can barely contain her glee
pan over to edith who makes a face
can i be the first to say ewwww
the minions finish the song
the girls sit at their table
agnes clearly has something on her mind
she stands up on the table
looks out at the crowd but they cant hear her
she still doesnt have the crowds attention so margo taps on her glass
everyone looks to agnes who is visibly nervous
id like to make some toast
she looks out at the crowd
is really nervous
looks over at gru
this helps and agnes pulls herself together and recites the mothers day poem from earlier
she um kisses my boo boos
she braids my hair
we love you mothers everywhere
agnes turns to lucy and looks her right in the eyes
and my new mom lucy is beyond compare
lucy smiles melting
the crowd goes awwwww
agnes and lucy spin around in a hug
the crowd cheers and applauds
gru margo and edith join agnes and lucy in a group hug
the family is complete
to the bride and gru
a minion begins to spin the village peoples ymca at the dj table
the minions several of whom are dressed as the village people begin to perform the song
the minion dressed as the chiquita banana lady also joins in
then the entire family boogies across the dance floor including dr
nefario and grus mom
a minion poses gru lucy and the girls for a formal picture
everyone looks good
they all smile
another picture adds grus mom dr
nefario and two minions to the group
another picture adds even more minions to the group
an evil minion pops up and photobombs the last picture
