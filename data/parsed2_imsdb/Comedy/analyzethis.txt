related news photos
was a big year
the russians put that sputnik into outer space the dodgers played their last game at ebbets field that guy shot frank costello in the head and missed and the gallo
brothers whacked albert anastasia in that barber shop in the park sheraton hotel
it was total chaos
with anastasia gone vito genovese figures hes king shit but carlo gambino and joe bananas both want to be boss of all bosses
so they call a meeting a big meeting
in faded mm documentary style we see a country road winding through rolling hills
at the top of the hill a black cadillac appears and sweeps through the peaceful landscape
it was the first time the whole commission was ever gonna meet face to face
bosses and wiseguys were comin in from all over the country and all the new york families too maybe sixty bosses the whole wiseguy world all headin toward this little
town upstate to figure out whats what
a sign reads entering apalachin pop
the black cadillac speeds past the sign then another black caddy then a black lincoln then another caddy a lincoln etc
your father and me we were goin up with tommy d
he was running the family at the time
anyway i dont know what anybody was thinking but some asshole thought it would be a good idea to have this meeting at joe babaras farm in the country where
nobody would notice
a local state police deputy is gassing up his motorcycle when the parade of shiny black cars rolls by
he looks up and scratches his head at the unusual sight
turns out the local cops were watching joe babara like a hawk
so now you got about fifty caddies and lincolns pullin into apalachin and some deputy sheriff with cow shit on his shoes notices all the traffic and calls the feds
the caddies and lincolns are all parked around a rambling country manor
bosses and wiseguys are meeting and greeting each other on the big front porch
one wiseguy is trying to shoo a cow away from his car
you wanna be a ribeye
get away from the fuckin car
federal agents start moving in quietly heavily armed wearing big fbi arm bands
the meeting never even got started
the feds moved in agents with weapons drawn charge the house and start breaking down the front door
and we moved out
gangsters in shiny suits are squeezing through windows and leaping off balconies
fleeing into the surrounding woods and fields
your papa and me hid in a field with hay or corn some kinda foliage i dont know
two wiseguys in suits crouch in the tall grass
suddenly they see a john deere harvester bearing down on them
then along comes this farmer who almost runs us over in a tractor so your father hauls out his piece this
cannon he used to carry and hijacks the goddamn tractor
funniest fuckin thing i ever saw
the farmer goes flying off the harvester and the two wiseguys drive off on it
the farmer looks up to see the john deere disappear in a swirling cloud of dust that fills the screen
on top of an espresso
pull back as a hand reaches in and runs a lemon rind along the rim of the cup
the espresso is picked up and sipped by manetta the aging boss of a prominent new york crime family
the place is nearly empty
manetta is talking to paul vitti a dark intense intelligent man in his late forties and a powerful boss in his own right
anyway carlo gambino came out of it capo de tutti capi and that was the last time the whole commission tried to meet until now
brooding i dont know
i dont like it
what do we need a meeting for
let everybody worry about their own business
they finish eating
the meeting was about how we were going to divide up the whole country
this meeting is about how were gonna survive
you got made guys informing for the feds bosses going to jail everybodys dealing drugs people are getting whacked without permission
and on top of everything now we got the chinese triads and these crazy russians to deal with
we need a leader
someone with fresh ideas
someone like you
its gonna be a new century paul
we gotta change with the times
what are we gonna get a fuckin web site
you remember what else happened in paul
yeah i remember
when your father died i promised him id always look out for you
come to the meeting
they get up to leave
vitti drops some money on the table
bodyguards follow them to the door
the waiters and the owner bow to them as they pass
they are almost out the door when vitti hesitates
wait a second
im just gonna grab a toothpick
the instant he steps back inside manetta and his bodyguard are struck by an incredible volley of gunfire which blows out all the glass in the door and windows
vittis bodyguard jelly grabs him and throws him behind the counter shielding him with his body
outside the shooting has stopped and curious bystanders are looking in the broken windows
vittis eyes well up with tears
being pulled out of a box
caroline a woman in her early thirties dabs at her eyes with the tissue
shes sitting on the couch in the office is warm comfortable and nicely decorated
weepy i kept telling him that i needed room to grow and find myself as a person
not just as a woman but as an independent entity
her therapist seems to be listening intently
i told him i needed to get in touch with my uniqueness but he couldnt handle that
he said i was driving him away
do you think i was driving him away dr
ben leans forward sympathetically
hes in his mid forties has an expressive face and a quick wit and despite the occasional lapse he is a gifted and caring psychologist
things end caroline
thats just a part of life
its how we deal with things ending thats important
i just cant believe its over between me and steve
maybe theres still hope
well he did take out a restraining order against you
i have to be honest thats usually not a good sign
but what should i do
well caroline i think the first thing you have to do
voice rising is stop whining about this pathetic loser
youre a tragedy queen
mocking steve doesnt respect me
steve doesnt love me anymore
who gives a shit
get a fucking life
you are without a doubt the most boring human being i have ever met
please say something interesting before i lapse into a goddamn coma
caroline looks curiously at ben unperturbed
lost in his fantasy not really listening
he comes to attention and tries to cover
i was just reflecting on your whole situation
its very interesting what you were just saying
i want you to think about it and im going to think about it so well both think about it and well continue next week when i get back from
caroline bursts into tears again
ben rushes upstairs and into his bedroom
his year old son michael is in his room putting on a tuxedo
changing hurriedly i know
i couldnt get rid of my last patient
i think she was a tick in a past life
yeah whats carolines problem
your boyfriends gone he hates your guts get over it
what did i tell you
you cant listen to my sessions
its private stuff
i cant help it
i hear you through the vent in my room
funny how that happens when you lie on the floor and put your ear up against it
hows that guy who dreams about shitting trout
entering putting on his tux shirt fine
he moved up to striped bass
put on your cummerbund
boy have you grown
did your mother move next door to a nuclear power plant
struggling with the cummerbund why do we have to wear rented clothes to grandpas party
helping him we have to dress up because grandpa cant have a good time unless everyone else is extremely uncomfortable
looks at michael and makes a quick decision forget the tux
ben exits pulling off the tux shirt
taking off his tux shirt are you ambivalent about grandpa isaac
from his room ambivalent
where do you get that stuff
annoyed shes not supposed to do that you know
your mother and i when we got divorced we agreed we wouldnt put you in the middle or use you as a go between to talk about each other
so just do me a favor and tell your mother to shut her big mouth
comes back into michaels room did she say anything about me getting married again
i think she could be feeling a little anger about it
she really cares
she says youre intimidated by women your own age and thats why you go for these young babes
listen for two seconds pretend im not your father
im just some guy okay
you gonna vent
venting i hate her
i really hate her
a beat then brightly okay
paul vitti gets out of his car and walks to the warehouse with his most trusted soldier jelly a hulking bruiser and his sidekick jimmy a tightly wound ferret with
chips on both shoulders
so what did you find out
as they walk the word is primo sindone must have ordered it but uh he hesitates
jelly looks at jimmy
reluctantly a lot of people think you set him up
why the fuck would i want to kill dominic
he was like a father to me
so you could be the big boss
everybody figures youre lookin to wipe out the competition before the big meeting
oh is that what they figure
its alright with me if you did i didnt kill him
i told you that
dont you hear
they enter a room where other vitti family soldiers eddie cokes tuna and johnny bigs are waiting
in the middle of the room a young rat named nicky shivers is tied to a chair under a strong overhead light
when he speaks we get a hint of mental incompetence
vitti i told em i dont know anything but they dont believe me cause that one time i said little joe hit dukey and it turned out he didnt but
i didnt know because smacks him shut the fuck up
nicky goes suddenly quiet
he watches in terror as jimmy steps aside and vitti moves close holding a short length of lead pipe
nicky you know me right
and you know what im gonna do to you if you lie to me right
uh youre gonna crack me on the head with that pipe
slaps him its a rhetorical question you fuckin idiot
im only gonna ask you this one time
who killed dominic manetta
i dont know
roars dont fuckin lie to me
in tears honest to god i dont know
you little rat bastard
vitti winds up to brain him with the pipe
they all wince in anticipation of the blow
but vitti just freezes there with his arm upraised
then he drops his arm and seems to sag
forget about it
he doesnt know anything
he tosses the pipe aside
get him outta here
jimmy looks at jelly in surprise
ben is driving to the party with michael
sitting in stopped traffic he checks his mirrors anxiously
to himself urgently look at this
ooh i hate walking into that house late
i think youre reacting like this because youre mad we have to go to this party
im not going to be analyzed by someone who up until a few years ago believed in santa
sorry but we only have room for one dr
sobol in this family
but theres two dr
theres you and grandpa
a beat can we talk about something else
are you going to read grandpas new book
mom says you wont because youre
does your mother talk about anything else or is it just me twenty four hours a day
ben rear ends the car in front of them
thats your mothers fault
your mother did that
the minivan has rear ended a black lincoln town car
the trunk has sprung open and nicky shivers can be seen in the trunk bound and gagged kicking and squirming
muffled shouts can be heard through the duct tape over his mouth
jelly and jimmy jump out of the lincoln and slam the top of the trunk just as ben gets out of the minivan to inspect the damage
heading ben off whats the matter with you
are you some kind of moron
its totally my fault
ben looks at the damage
the lincoln has gotten the worst of it
the rear bumper is hanging off and jelly is struggling to latch the trunk
did you see anything
i was talking to my son
i took my eyes off the road forget that bullshit
did you see anything
jelly steps in to defuse the situation warning jimmy off with a look
thats all right sir
its our fault for being in front of you like that
surprised well i should have been watching
let me give you my insurance information its okay
forget about it
it looks like your whole rear end might be screwed up
jimmy is reattaching the rear bumper and securing the trunk lid with duct tape
no it was like that before
maybe we should call the police
suddenly menacing why
fuck the police
horns start honking behind them
at least take my card
you might look at the damage in the morning and change your mind
jelly takes the card and reads it
youre a doctor
you talk to a lotta nuts huh
ben hears kicking from inside the car trunk
pings and knocks
hey how do those minivans handle
take it easy doc
ben looks totally confused as jelly hustles back to his car
bens father at the piano in the spacious elegant tastefully decorated living room surrounded by adoring guests playing and singing an exuberant rendition of you must have been a beautiful
isaac is a silver haired patrician overloaded with self esteem
ending the sing along all right neurotics only
well you must have been a beautiful ba a by cause baby look at you now thank god for prozac baby look at you now
standing off to the side talking to bens mother dorothy
in the corner is a large advertising display featuring isaacs smiling picture on the front cover of his new book tell me what you feel tell me what you want

we want to be there but i have three book signings next weekend
i cant piss off these big book stores
if i cancel theyll stick me down on the bottom shelf
thats how they are

the self help book business is full of vindictive pricks
looking around ben
im sorry but ive been alone for eight years now ive finally met someone i want to spend the rest of my life with and i would really like you
to meet her before we get married
youre going to be her family
i think its better she knows that up front

jumping in i think ill go talk to the mayor
the mayors here
i can only hope
hows your practice
ive got some very interesting patients extremely interesting
dad has a patient who dreams he shits trout
excuse us michael
isaac pulls ben into the foyer
why are you wasting your time out there in the boondocks
new york city is the mecca of madness
im just not sure i could spend my life dealing with people whose biggest crisis is how to fire the maid
it beats a guy with an ass full of flounder
and dont minimize my practice
why are you getting so defensive
this is about your own feelings of inadequacy
you always turn it back on me
why do you do that
why do you think i do that
why do you think i think you do that
go ahead now you ask me why i think you think i think you do that
i want you to think about what i said
and when youre ready to talk to me like a normal person ill be at the piano with regis philbin
as he crosses away rege
im not singing isaac
now ladies and gentlemen at the piano regis philbin
applause and laughter from the guests
ben grabs a glass of champagne from a passing waiters tray
to the waiter thomas wolfe was right
you cant go home again because your parents still live there
vittis men converse quietly while a soldier sweeps the room for bugs
he gives the all clear and salvatore masiello the old consigliere speaks
the manetta family is asking a lot of questions
they think we hit dominic
carlo mangano the burly underboss of the vitti family jumps in
they were after paul
to vitti its a miracle you survived
i thank god
yeah thank god
all i know is if i didnt have some veal stuck in my teeth id be laying there with dominic
this is all about the big meeting
primo sindone wants to run the whole show
yeah but primos a boss
he knows the rules
he couldnt go after dominic and paul unless the other families gave their permission
starting to sweat if they did were heading for one big fuckin war
having trouble breathing talk to zello and baldassare
find out what you can
we got two weeks
if the other new york bosses are against us i want to know it before i walk into that meeting
he feels a stabbing pain in his chest
you all right paul
you dont look good
im a little choked up here
i gotta get some air
he walks outside
mangano looks quizzically after them
vitti is having trouble breathing
you feel all right
i feel like shit
this whole thing is like a huge fuckin headache
concerned you havin one of those mindgrains
sweating profusely now vitti feels another stabbing chest pain
get the car
vitti is putting on his shirt
he looks considerably better
jelly is sitting down tapping his own knee with the little rubber hammer
doctor shulman a young cardiology resident enters
good news mr
your heart is just fine
how could it be fine
ive had like eight heart attacks in the last three weeks
well based on everything id say you probably had an anxiety attack
a beat what
an anxiety attack
a panic attack
i can give you some xanax if it happens again soon
menacing look at me
do i look like a guy who panics
nervous now theres nothing i mean its a common thing where did you go to medical school
i had a heart attack you quack bastard
very scared now well not according to these as vitti moves toward the doctor jelly instinctively grabs the doctor from behind and holds him while vitti wraps the blood pressure
cuff around his neck
low and deadly pumping up the cuff with the squeeze ball listen to me jerk off
i had a mild heart attack and now its over
the doctor nods vigorously his eyes bugging out as the pressure around his neck increases
if anyone asks you you never saw me and i was never here
is that clear
to jelly take the chart
jelly releases the doctor grabs all the papers and follows vitti out the door
vitti and jelly come walking out the emergency room exit
jelly i need you to do something for me as my friend
you have to find me a doctor
we just came from the doctor
not that kind of doctor
i need a head doctor
youre gonna change your face like sonny black
dont get his nose though he looks like a pig
not a plastic surgeon ya spoostud
do i have to spell everything out
it saves time
i need you to find me a psychiatrist
this is like the psychic network or something
i just ran into a psychiatrist
actually he ran into me
is he any good
yeah he seemed like a smart guy
he had a business card and everything he had a card
thats a real fuckin achievement
what do you need a shrink for anyway
its not for me
its for a friend
this friend is having some problems so im going to ask the shrink some questions and get some answers for my friend
and nobody can know
if anyone hears im talking to a shrink it could be interpreted the wrong way
you know what i mean
then can i ask you one thing
is it me
ben is with a patient carl anderson a high strung milquetoast in his late forties
carl im detecting a pattern here
you seem to settle too easily for things
no well there you go
you just did it again
i suggested something and you immediately agreed
why do you think you do that
i dont know
well sometimes people do it because they fear rejection or disapproval but you cant let that worry you carl
and you cant agree with things just for the sake of agreeing
stand your ground
dont let people roll over you
the door opens and jelly enters
im in a session here
yeah i know im sorry
youre one of the guys i rear ended the other night
to carl get outta here
jelly takes carl by the elbow and lifts him off the couch
you got a coat nutbar
what are you doing
the hell he is
hes not going anywhere until were done with his session
jelly pulls a big roll of bills out of his pocket removes the rubber band and peels off a couple of fifties
to carl ill give you a hundred bucks to get out of here
carl looks at the money then he gives ben a plaintive look
dont take it carl
carl looks back to jelly
peeling off another bill a hundred and fifty
hes not leaving
trembling three hundred
pays him youre not that fuckin crazy
carl takes the money gives ben the thumbs up and exits
jelly follows him to the door and waves for someone to come in
listen if youre upset about your car i can understand that
but you dont just barge in here paul vitti steps into the office
jelly crosses to take vittis coat
you know who i am
no you dont
youve seen my picture in the papers
jelly wait outside
vitti walks around the room taking everything in
he picks up the phone and listens
ben sits quickly on the coffee table
he crushes a box of tissues then moves them out from under his ass
vitti picks up a stack of cds and looks through them
tony bennett huh
hes my favorite
vitti picks up an autographed baseball bat from bens desk
puts up his hands mr
vitti i tried to give the guy my insurance information but he wouldnt take it
seriously i tried several times because it was all my please dont kill me
i was just gonna ask if you liked baseball
big yankee fan
vitti puts the bat down
not that its your fault but your friend he interrupted a patients session and thats not good
i think this is a matter for our insurance companies dont you think
i dont care about the car
a friend of mine is having a problem and he might have to see a shrink so im going to ask you a couple questions
do we sit
whatever makes you comfortable
ben starts for his chair but vitti sits in it first
ben sits on the couch
vitti adjusts the cuffs of his shirt and runs a hand down the crease in his slacks
okay the first thing i gotta know about is privacy
you must hear a lot of weird shit in here
how do i know you wont go testifying not testifying but you know talking about it to somebody else
i wont discuss a patient with anyone for any reason unless i know the patient may be a danger to himself
like if im concerned a patient might kill himself
not fuckin likely or kill someone else
ben looks to vitti for a response
vitti stares at him for a long uncomfortable beat
so who starts
why dont you tell me why you think you need therapy
i dont need therapy
im helping out my friend
you didnt hear me say that
you guys are supposed to be so great when it comes to listening
you cant remember what i said two seconds ago
im very sorry
i have to tell you doc im not thrilled with the level of service up to this point
why dont you tell me about your friend
hes a powerful guy
never had a problem dealing with things you know
now all of a sudden hes falling apart
he cries for no reason
hes having trouble sleeping
and then he started having these attacks
you know cant breathe dizzy chest pains like you think youre gonna die
whats with all you doctors and the fuckin panic
did i say panic
dizzy breathing chest pain attacks
so the question is what can he do to make it stop
ben decides to go for it
im going to go out on a limb here
i think your friend is you
you you you you have a gift my friend
medication could help but if you really want to get to the bottom of this youre going to want to get some kind of therapy
hedging with me
oh i dont know
id have to look at my schedule
im very heavily booked right now and im going on a short vacation tomorrow
where you going
i dont really share that information with
you know this could be good
just getting that off my chest i feel better already
its like a load is off my shoulders
well i really didnt do anything you did something
where is it
youre good doctor
ill be in touch
but listen to me
leaning close menacing if i talk to you and it turns me into a fag ill kill you
could we define fag because some feelings may come up vitti silences him with a wave of his hand
i go fag you die
vitti gives ben a little pat on the cheek then turns and exits
ben is stunned
ben comes out the back door of the house carrying a couple of suitcases
michael follows behind him with his bags
they cross to the car in the driveway
i hope you didnt leave any food in your room
i dont want to come home and find a science fair
analyze this rev

sheepishly that got away from me near the end
vitti stares at ben
i couldnt get it up tonight

no i mean for the big game against michigan state
of course sexually
you flew fifteen hundred miles and dragged me out of bed in the middle of the night because you couldnt get an erection
doesnt that prove im motivated

the dead dick thing
well one time
and another time

a beat there was another time
but it was after a big meal so you know that dont count
listen being unable to perform three or four times five
five times it isnt the end of the world
maybe not to you look at you but if i cant get it up that makes me less of a man and i cant have that
moving closer to ben in my business i deal with animals
they may seem dumb to an educated guy like you but make no mistake about it doctor animals are very cunning
and they sense weakness
right now im an injured animal
its only a matter of time before one of the lions out there catches the scent
then im dead
thats the way it is
if you dont understand that then you dont understand the life i live and you dont understand me
i have until the end of the week to get strong or theyre gonna eat me up
if they dont kill me in the meantime
what happens next week
i cant tell you and you dont want to know
i cant do anything that fast
and even if i could whats my goal here
to make you a happy well adjusted gangster
look the other day i saw a commercial on television some kid playing with a couple of puppies

youre turning me down
vitti when i got into family therapy this was not the family i had in mind

id like to go now

this is what im talking about
im a dead man
ben turns away and starts for the door
through the tears you call yourself a doctor
you should be ashamed
a real doctor couldnt turn his back on a person whos suffering
finally all right
hands him a handkerchief what happened with your wife tonight
wiping away his tears i wasnt with my wife
i was with my girlfriend
you have a girlfriend
we could do two months on that alone
what youre gonna start moralizing with me now
do you have marriage problems
then why do you have a girlfriend
i do things with her i cant do with my wife
why cant you do those things with your wife
thats the mouth she kisses my children good night with
whats the matter with you
have you been under a lot of stress lately
you mean like seeing your best friend murdered

well based on what you told me before about your attacks id say thats probably it then
its just stress
i doubt if theres anything physically wrong with you
brightening pointing a finger at ben you

i had a serious patient emergency
you have patients in florida
he followed me here from new york
i had to go
who is this patient
a beat paul vitti
a long beat
worried oh ben
but dont worry
its not like hes a real patient
hes got this idea in his head that im helping him
youre not going to treat him

that would be too scary
you dont want a person like that in your life believe me
ive covered the mob down here
ive seen what they can do
listen its been taken care of
i told him i couldnt see him again
he understood and its over
tearing up i was so worried
he hugs her and holds her tightly feeling like a jerk for lying to her
immigrant garment workers cut and sew fabric
this is sindone headquarters
a few of his trusted guys are in attendance handsome jack potatoes and moony his consigliere
it doesnt figure
we take out manetta what does vitti do
why doesnt he move
primo sindone a vain pompous mussolini is standing on a stool in his underwear being fitted for a suit by a nervous tailor
im telling you primo hes planning something big
the shit is really gonna come down
then let it come down
vittis a tough guy but a lot of tough guys got fed to the crabs off red hook over the years
looking down at the tailor you been down there a long time
are you measuring my inseam or contemplating a lifestyle change
sindone nods for the tailor to get out
what about vitti
the whole time we were growing up he was the smart guy i was the dope
my father was a nickel and dime shitheel his father had it all
vito genovese blew it at apalachin because he forgot to kill gambino before the meeting
i wont make the same mistake
i want paul vitti dead now
you two astronauts think you can handle that
handsome jack and potatoes nod their agreement
you got it primo
a killer whale leaps up and takes it from between his teeth
the audience in the stands applaud as the killer whale splashes back into the water
ben is clearly bored
to ben come on
get into it
i dont understand
they jump out of the water they splash they eat fish
its not a real stretch for a whale
if they did a number from west side story then id be into it
to michael were having fun right
well to be real honest
im not having as much fun as it looks like i am
im pretending you know because we have to bond and everything
laura looks at ben
to laura youve got to admire the openness
a tad too excited here comes the whale again
the whale leaps high in the air and crashes back down sending a wall of water flying into the first few rows
walking by the tank get soaked by the huge wave
ben looks and sees jelly beckoning him
to laura and michael im hungry
yeah im going to get a hot dog
who wants a hot dog
rising ill go with you

youre pretending to have a good time
i dont want to spoil that

ben confronts jelly and jimmy who are soaked to the skin

no he and i discussed this
i told him id see him when i got got back to new york
dont be a skavootz
it is what it is
if he needs you sooner you go
no im not going and if you bother me again i wont treat him at all
end of story
ben plunges into the tank in the middle of a school of sharks
he screams silently underwater and swims desperately for the top
a couple of families watching through the viewing window laugh and applaud as if its part of the show
an alligator loafer steps down on it
we tilt up to a seven year old boy with a shovel and pail
after a beat a ten dollar bill falls where the sandcastle was
the boys face instantly brightens
the alligator loafer belongs to jelly
hes walking with jimmy and other bodyguards who form a loose protective perimeter around ben and vitti as they walk along the shore
all the guys are wearing loud jersey beach outfits
they threw me in the shark tank paul
the shark tank
they were trying to make a point
what that youre a scary guy
i get it
youre in a mood you know that
yeah i get that way when a shark tries to chew on my ass
i dont want to calm down

the usual bullshit
referring to bodyguards this one
no regular family
stops i want you to draw a picture of a house
in the sand
what kind of house

vitti bends over and starts drawing in the sand
this is good
i come to florida and draw pictures in the sand like a jerkoff
tino a local miami hitman is covertly watching ben and vitti on the beach
he talks into a cell phone
i dont know what theyre doing

hey dont sweat it
you told me to take care of him ill take care of him
okay ill call you back
vitti finishes drawing
where are the people

where are the people who live in your house
well you see theyd come out and say hello but the whole familys in the witness protection program
its very sad
what the fuck you want from me
they start walking
okay forget the house

fbi agents steadman ricci and provano click away with long lens cameras as they watch from the rooftop

he crosses to the bar pours himself a drink and lights a cigarette
you know normally a patient wouldnt smoke or drink during a session
blowing smoke thats an interesting fact ill have to remember if im ever on jeopardy
so tell me about your father
he was a big man in the neighborhood very well respected
everybody loved him god rest his soul
he passed away
no i just like saying god rest his soul
yeah he passed away
he died when i was about twelve
were you and your father close
yeah you know pretty close
i guess we werent getting along that great right then
why was that
i was hangin out in the neighborhood
i had a borghata like a kid gang hooligan shit nothin big
but my father didnt like it
you fought about it
he slapped the shit out of me
and then that night he died
how did that feel
it felt great
how did it feel
shrugs i dont know
well think about it
were you angry were you afraid
yeah i guess
any feelings of guilt
i didnt kill him
im just speculating but maybe in some way you wanted him to die
why would i want my father to die
analyze this rev
well you said you were fighting
you were rebelling against his authority
there may have been some unresolved oedipal conflict
oedipus was a greek king who killed his father and married his mother
its an instinctual developmental drive
the young boy wants to replace his father so he can totally possess his mother
are you saying i wanted to fuck my mother
its a primal fantasy have you seen my mother
that is the sickest fucking thing ive ever heard
well then freuds a sick fuck and you are too for bringing it up

using a stolen pass key tino quietly opens the door and enters
he steps into the living room and hears water running in the bathroom
he stealthily approaches the bathroom door and draws his pistol with a silencer on it from under his jacket
vitti stares at his reflection in the mirror then starts washing his face
in the mirror we can see the door starting to open behind him and the long barrel of tinos pistol through the crack
vitti blindly gropes for a towel and starts drying his face
tino is about to shoot when jelly comes up behind him throws one strong arm around his neck in a powerful choke hold and grabs tinos gun hand with his
vitti hears the sounds of a scuffle steps out of the bathroom and sees jelly struggling with tino
tino gets off a couple of wild shots but jelly finally shakes the gun loose from tinos hand
vitti picks up the gun and puts it to tinos head
tino shuts his eyes and turns away expecting the shot but then vittis hand starts to shake and he breaks into a cold sweat
tino opens his eyes sees vitti frozen and starts fighting with renewed strength
jelly hangs on looks at vitti with concern then wrestles tino out onto the balcony

cheeky marble cherubs bathe in the soaring jets and bubbling pools of a large rococo fountain

and whos going to be there
us three a clergyman and any family members whove completed their crisis counseling
and no guests without necks
everybody has to have a neck

i can hear better in there anyway
on the coffee table are dozens of pictures of ben and paul vitti taken in miami and just about everywhere else
a beat so
can you explain these photographs doctor sobol
im a psychotherapist
paul vitti is my patient
was your patient
thats what i meant
but not like a real patient
so why did he send you that fountain
that was a gift to celebrate the completion of his therapy
we got our television from an agoraphobic so its not that unusual you know maybe you should discuss this with my attorney
yeah maybe you should
doctor sobol paul vitti is an extremely dangerous man
were talking conspiracy fraud extortion racketeering grand theft murder
well yeah but dont forget the man is a sociopath
youve got to expect that kind of behavior ben looks out the window and does a double take
isaac and dorothy are standing in the yard gawking at the fountain
excuse me fellas
my folks are here and id like to well die would be my first choice
can i go out
its your house
too bad you didnt remember that when you were breaking in
as he goes honey maybe the federal agents would like something to drink
could you see what we have
to the agents i tried guys
ben rushes up to isaac and dorothy
what a surprise
ben kisses his mother as she stares at the fountain
that certainly makes a statement
its a little big for the yard dont you think
what can i tell you mom
it looked much smaller in the store
think itll affect your water pressure
i think itll affect the tides
what are you doing here
your father and i are just very concerned about what happened in florida
how was your flight home
anyone hang themselves in first class
we got in last night we couldnt sleep a wink

i dont want to disturb that dynamic

a beat no
insulted well im going to wait in the car
theres too much spray
dorothy crosses away
whats with you and paul vitti
well dad im not at liberty to discuss that
hes your patient
are you joking
have you thought about what this could do to your reputation
you know i always wanted to be great but then i realized that i might have to settle for just being good enough
now ive got this guy whos hurting and im thinking that if i can help this guy maybe i can be a little bit great
jesus ben youre the one whos going to be hurting
i want you to stop seeing him
didnt you read your own book
instead of trying to run my life why dont you just close your eyes take a deep breath tell me what you feel tell me what you want
uncomfortable this is bullshit
you wrote it
with difficulty i love you and im afraid for you i want you to be safe and i want you to have a good life
deeply touched is that really it
they embrace awkwardly
you know why i became a shrink
because i grew up with a great one walking around the house
i thought you became a shrink because you were sleeping with your psychology professor at columbia
yes and because of you
ben comes back to laura and the agents
okay so you were saying
let me cut to the chase
sometime in the next week or so the heads of every major crime family in the united states are going to meet together somewhere in the new york area
ben nods finally understanding vittis two week deadline
we think the stage is set for a major bloodbath
has he mentioned anything about it to you
if he said anything about a bloodbath i probably wouldve remembered it
bloodbath is one of those words that you know stands out in a conversation
gathering photos you could really help us out by supplying information about that meeting
and if i dont
if you dont i will personally make your life a living hell
i want you to think about that and call me at this number when you change your mind
you mean if i change my mind
i mean when
guess what fellas
you dont scare me
laura sit down
to the agents theres going to be a bloodbath
only its going to be between you and me
you think you can break into our home and intimidate us
that aint the way it works here boys
whatever he and paul vitti talked about is privileged
he doesnt have to tell you a thing

look it up
now if hes done something wrong take him downtown and book him
otherwise ill ask you very kindly to get the hell out of my house
well be in touch

impressed laura that was really furious oh shut up
laura storms out of the room in a fury
ben stands looking miserable then we hear michaels voice from the vent
you are in trouble
vitti is conferring with sal masiello his consigliere
paul i dont mean this in a disrespectful way
you know i was a good friend to your father and i will always be a good friend to you
but the word is out that youve been talking to a shrink
is that right
vitti shoots jelly a sharp look
jelly looks away
whats the point here
this concerns the whole family
right now were the only ones who know about it but if it gets out on the street what then
who knows what youve been saying in there
its none of anybodys business what i say in there
paul i beg to differ
if youre doing this to establish some kind of insanity defense later thats one thing
but everybodys gonna think youre falling apart and that aint good
theyll take it as a sign of weakness and that makes us all vulnerable
sindone would take over everything
so what do you want me to do
its time to end it
what do you mean end it
get rid of this shrink
he knows too much already
you want me to whack my doctor
if you dont do it somebody else will
its the only way
nobody touches him
you hear me
anybody lays a finger on him ill kill em
is that clear
vitti and ben are walking down the street
for some reason vitti is wearing a hat
im going to buy some fruit
you want anything
no go ahead
ben crosses to a sidewalk fruit stand and starts picking out oranges
vitti leans up against a car waiting for him to finish
shots are fired
he runs toward the car
more shots are fired
ben is hit
vitti pulls out his gun but he fumbles and drops it
the gunmen run off
ben sinks to the pavement mortally wounded
vitti kneels next to him and sobs loudly
he puts his hand to his head knocking off his hat
ben jerks upright in bed knocked awake by the nightmare
someone dips their fingers in
he goes down on one knee and genuflects in front of a big crucifix
ben wiggles his finger in the holy water just kind of curtsies and waves at jesus on the cross
you look lousy
you all right
listen paul please dont send me any more gifts
you didnt like the fountain
thats not the point
its a boundary issue
i say if more people gave from the heart wed all be better off
lets see your watch
as ben shows his wrist piece of junk
youre getting a rolex
dont buy me a rolex
who said anything about buying it
they cross to the main aisle of the church
listen i really need to talk to you
ben stops cold
a casket sits in front of the altar
a funeral service is in progress
we grew up together
worked for a crew out of jersey city
how did he die
he was on his way to talk to a federal prosecutor
got hit by a truck twice
do i need to know that
im having nightmares as it is
the funeral procession comes down the aisle
last night i dreamed we were walking down the street i stopped to buy some fruit and they shot me like brando in the godfather
was i there
a mourner walks up to vitti bows his head in respect and kisses vitti on both cheeks
vitti on both cheeks
vitti gives him a consoling pat on the shoulder then the man kisses ben and walks off
you dropped your gun then you ran over to me and started yelling papa papa
i was fredo
i dont think so
an older woman kisses vittis hand then both his cheeks
vitti whispers a few words to her then she kisses bens hand and moves on
more old ladies kiss their hands as they walk by
youre losing it doc
you may need therapy yourself
a man comes up to vitti kisses him on both cheeks embraces him with excessive energy then repeats the whole scene with ben and exits
ben looks at vitti
him i dont know
lets get private
ben and vitti come out of the cathedral

steadman shuts off a tape recorder having just played the altered tape for a stunned ben and laura
a long beat then ben looks up at the agents

jimmy is parked at the corner watching the sobol house as the three fbi agents leave
masiello is face to face with vitti

jellys cellular phone rings
he steps away and answers it quietly during the following
the fbi was at his house today

you dont know this guy
jelly covers the phone and turns to vitti
he says he needs to see you right away
ben waits on a deserted corner in brooklyn
a black town car appears and stops to pick him up
the windows are heavily tinted
ben takes a deep breath crosses to the car and opens the back door
ben finds jelly sitting in the back seat next to vitti
sit up front with jimmy
anxiously you want me to sit in front

the agents monitor the conversation through the bug ben is wearing
they shake their heads at the incomprehensible dialogue
what did he say

you always gotta nip that shit in the bud
but if the first thing is okay that should fix everything
including the second thing
yeah but exactly

ben watches vitti and mangano cross the room then turns to jelly and jimmy
when he was younger they probably called him stevie veal

ben goes into a stall latches the door and drops his pants
jelly combs his hair in the mirror
ben hastily unbuttons his shirt revealing a small microphone taped to his chest
he picks at the edge of the tape takes a deep breath then rips it off
at the urinal reacts to bens cry
you need more roughage
a bran muffin in the morning would help with that
ben and jelly rejoin vitti
ben starts right in on him

ben looks to vitti for help

you know we call this a transference neurosis
its when the patient starts acting out his problems with his therapist instead of out in the world
its usually considered a good sign
not for me in this case but jimmy forces him into the back of the car
the lincoln makes a u turn in front of parettis and drives off down the street passing handsome jack and potatoes in a car parked at the corner
the car takes off after the lincoln
the agents are monitoring the bug but all they hear is water running and toilets flushing
whats he doing in there
hes been in the bathroom for half an hour
ricci and steadman look at each other
the fbi van pulls up and lurches to a stop
steadman rushes in pushes open the stall and sees the microphone and transmitter in the bottom of the toilet bowl
jellys car pulls into a scrap metal yard and parks
they all get out
jelly hands vitti a gun
to jimmy and jelly leave us alone
jelly looks apologetically at ben
its not personal you know
dont kid yourself jelly
it doesnt get more personal than this
jelly and jimmy walk away leaving ben alone with vitti
you know why i have to do this dont you

no but i knew he looked wrong
they looked too good for a busboy
he walked over to the table
i watched him the whole way

analyze this rev
my father was so mad at me
and you were mad at him
i couldnt say anything
i never saw the second guy
my mother started screaming

what do you want to tell him
you have to

breaks down im sorry

analyze this rev

vitti leans back against the car slumps to the ground and starts sobbing years of pent up grief finally finding expression
standing around smoking waiting for the death shot
whats taking so long
im ruining my goddamn shoes here
fuckin bruno maglis
whats wrong with you
dont you have any respect
this is a very difficult thing for paul
shoulda let me do it
id be home watchin e
worlds strongest man
you should see these guys
ben is comforting vitti
you couldnt save him paul
he was trying to save you
thats what you fought about
he didnt want this for you and you dont want it for anthony
you dont want him to grow up the way you did without a father
vitti just cries louder
hearing the crying
jesus the guys fallin apart
why doesnt he just pop him
analyze this rev
ben tries to comfort vitti who is still crying
your fathers not dead paul
hes alive in you
and hes trying to tell you something
suddenly there is a gunshot and a bullet ricochets off the top of the car
oh my god
he opens up with a mac
jimmy goes down hit in the shoulder
jelly dives for cover behind a rusted car body
in a panic paul
vitti continues to sob oblivious to the gun battle raging around him
he fires back at handsome jack
he rakes the lincoln with a burst from the assault rifle
all the windows are blown out by the gunfire
for gods sake shoot somebody
vitti just sits there on the ground still sobbing quietly
he reloads and fires again
jellys last shot strikes him right in the chest and he goes down
he sees potatoes fall and starts moving out covering his retreat with another burst from his machine gun
something snaps inside ben
he takes the gun out of vittis hand and starts firing he sees handsome jack emerge from cover and takes him out with five quick shots
he goes down firing dead before he hits the ground
its suddenly quiet
after a long moment jimmy rolls over and moans
jelly goes to him and starts examining his wound
ben stands up still holding vittis gun
he sees handsome jack lying dead on the ground
oh my god
did i do that
that ones mine
you got the chevy camaro and the side by side refrigerator freezer
vitti emerges from behind the car looking red eyed but composed again and looks at ben
pretty fuckin ironic isnt it
you can give me back the gun now doctor
vitti holds out his hand
ben hesitates for a moment then hands him the gun
i wasnt really gonna whack you
off jellys skeptical look all right maybe i was gonna whack you but i was real conflicted about it
i dont think i can see you anymore
yeah i figured
this was big tonight
you might feel a little raw for a while
so good luck
its been vitti nods they stand there for another moment then ben walks off into the night
elaine a fortyish tired looking wife and mother sits on the couch across from ben
ben looks bored and depressed
i want to please him in bed but whatever i do it seems like its never enough
now he wants me to say things when were making love
what kinds of things does he want you to say elaine
well he wants me to call him big boy
and hes my bucking bronco and im supposed to ride him hard and put him back in the barn wet
michaels laughter is heard coming through the vent
ben closes his eyes and sighs deeply
are you all right dr
let me suggest something elaine
if the man wants you to say things damn it you should get down on all fours and bark like a dog if thats going to get the job done
break out the wine baby
smoke a joint
do what you have to do because life is too short
its just too fucking short
elaine stares taken aback then she smiles
jelly jimmy and iron mike arrive and walk up to the house
the rest of the crew are standing around on the porch
jelly enters and finds vitti in his undershorts putting on his tie looking very strong
how you feelin boss
you need anything
no im great
never felt better in my life
when this meeting is over they wont know what hit em
jelly gives him the thumbs up and exits
vitti turns to the tv and starts knotting his tie as a prudential insurance commercial starts playing featuring a father and his son
as vitti watches the sentimental ad his eyes fill with tears
the sun is shining
a beautiful day for a wedding
here comes the bride is heard
the crowd oohs and aahs as laura starts down the aisle in her wedding dress
isaac and dorothy are standing near the chupah ready to receive her

laura and ben stand before a reformed rabbi
the family is gathered again

ben do you take this woman laura to be your lawfully wedded wife for richer for poorer in sickness and in health til death do you part so help you
ben looks over and sees jelly standing behind some flowers to the side of the altar
no not you

jelly moves closer
the guests start to mutter

ben feels a gun pressed against his back
you cant shoot me jelly
vitti couldnt shoot you
but heres something about me you should know
i never got married doctor sobol
i dont have a hobby
i never got a dog or a cat
i dont even have a goldfish
i live for one reason only and thats to serve mr

if he told me to jump off a tall building not only would i do it i would hope to survive so i could do it again and again until
he told me to stop
this is all i know
this is all i got
so please dont think i wont kill you because id hate for your last thought to be a wrong one
youre going to that meeting
parked on th street ricci and another agent watch the limo emerge from the waldorf garage
ricci signals someone on the radio
flies into view over park avenue and starts tracking the limo
the black stretch limo approaches the tunnel entrance
an fbi helicopter zooms into view high above
steadman and provano track the limo from the air as it enters the tunnel
fifteen identical limos emerge from the tunnel on the queens side and start criss crossing as they leave the toll booths then head off in different directions
steadman and provo try to pick bens limo out of the pack of identical limos heading up the long island expressway
desperately which one is it
the black one
ben is in the back with jelly and jimmy
one of their crew iron mike is driving
ben is putting on a suit of jimmys
he looks very anxious
his shoulder bandaged just remember
thats a fuckin valentino suit
you spill anything on it ill mess you up good
youre making him nervous
if he gets nervous and fucks up theyll kill him for sure
to ben lets go over it again
this is insane
vittis been detained apologies all around blah blah blah
then you say youre the new consigliere and youre prepared to speak for mr
then you just keep your mouth shut and hope nobody asks you nothin
boy this is some fuckin plan
to ben if you have to talk just be vague
can you do that
im a psychologist
believe me i can be vague
vitti is lying on the bed staring at the ceiling
marie is stroking his forehead
then he looks over and sees anthony sitting in a chair at the foot of the bed watching him with concern
shouldnt you be outside playing or something
no its all right
how long you gonna sit there
shrugs how long you gonna lay there
the limo pulls into the parking lot of the tops limousine service
fifty other limos are already parked there
jelly and jimmy get out followed by ben now dressed in shiny suit and pinky ring
ben jelly and jimmy enter a garage the size of a small airplane hangar
the floor has been cleared and long tables set up to form a square in the middle of the room
wiseguys with shotguns patrol the catwalks above the floor and soldiers are posted at all the doors
sotto voce i cant do this
im telling you i cannot do this
dont fucking whine
whinings a dead giveaway
youre the consigliere for chrissake
around the tables sit forty or fifty of the biggest gangsters in the world
a few captains stand around the perimeter ready to serve their bosses
these are the bosses
that one looks like my uncle max
jelly steers ben to an empty seat next to carlo mangano
surprised whats goin on
on his way
mangano eyes ben with contempt
whats he doin here
hes its okay
forget about it
forget about it
what the hell is that
seated directly across the room from ben is primo sindone
he stares hard at ben trying to place him then leans over to moony his consigliere
whos the guy with jelly
i dont know
ben looks away nervously
to jelly borderline hysterical i cant do this
he starts to get up but jelly pulls him back down
moony stands up and gets everyones attention
all right gentlemen
i think we better start
we have a big agenda so for now lets stick to the big issues
and it would help if you identify yourselves when you speak since we dont all know each other and we didnt think anybody would be into wearing any fucking name
laughter around the table
sindone stands up and looks straight at ben
im primo sindone
they call me sonny long
its good to see so many of the old faces here and to welcome the new ones from all over the country
i see frank zello and joe baldassare but im a little disappointed to see that the head of our other new york family isnt here today
all i see is his man jelly and some sawed off little prick nobody knows
jelly looks at ben waiting for him to speak but ben just sits frozen looking down at his hands
stands up rattled yeah well the thing is mr
vitti has been detained and he sends his apologies for being detained and he apologizes for his detainment
what kind of bullshit is that
whats more important than this
as the host of this meeting i take his not being here as a sign of disrespect to me and to all these other men too who came a long
way to be here
vitti meant no disrespect
the thing is hes not feeling well
hes sick and he didnt feel well
ben rises and slaps jelly hard across the face
we dont ever discuss mr
vittis health outside the family
you know better
jelly is stunned
the bosses murmur
all right who is this guy and what the fuck is he doing here
in answer to your first question my name is ben sobol off sindones look leone
they call me the doctor
as for your second question
im here representing paul vitti
as his conser conghili prompting consigliere slaps him again dont you ever correct me again
as his consigliere im intimately involved in all aspects of the family business and im prepared to speak for mr
vitti on all matters
okay doctor then lets get down to business
everybody knows theres been this thing between me and paul vitti for a long time
which thing are you talking about
the first thing or the second thing
what second thing
i only know one thing
well i dont see how we can discuss the first thing without bringing up the second thing
didnt you talk to the guy
he tugs meaningfully on his earlobe
the guy with the thing
what the fuck are you talking about
how should i know
you brought it up
gestures helplessly to the others this is the whole problem
you cant have an intelligent conversation with the man
how about if i just break your fuckin neck
what do you think of that
its not important what i think
what do you think
what do i think
i think its a good idea
why would i say it if i didnt think it was good
i dont know
why would you
frustrated i wouldnt
thats what im saying
have you always had a problem dealing with your anger
what are you talking about
what do you think im talking about
explodes i dont know what the fuck youre talking about
see youre angry again
do you feel you have to get angry to be heard
sindone turns to a couple of other bosses frank zello and joe baldassare
whats he talking about
i dont know
but you do have a tendency to get angry a lot
i agree primo
im trying to talk about vitti
why are we talking about me
do you feel youre not worthy enough to be talked about
what does that mean
what do you think it means
primo calm down
how can i calm down when this prick wont stop with the questions
could you pass the fruit please
youre a dead man
sindone whips out a pistol and points it at ben but just as hes about to shoot primo
all eyes turn
hes standing there staring at sindone cool clear and unafraid
he looks like a king
the room goes silent
vitti looks around the table nods and crosses to ben
jelly gets up to greet him
quietly to jelly wait outside with the car running
jelly nods and exits
what are you doing here
saving your ass
ill take it from here
ben sits greatly relieved
to the group im paul vitti
im sorry i was late
those of you who know me will know i meant no disrespect
if its all right with you theres something id like to say then ill leave you to your business
ben looks at vitti and sees a kind of serenity and clarity hes never seen before
about two and a half weeks ago somebody killed my friend dominic manetta
he looks straight at sindone
dont look at me
everybody knows you whacked him so you could take over everything
what i really came here to say is that ive come to a very important decision in my life
i want out
a great murmur of surprise sweeps around the room
ben looks at him proudly
im going away for a while but i will respect the oath i took the day i was made and whatever i know about anyone elses business i take with
me to the grave
you have my word
a negative buzz among the bosses
as for my own organization i know carlo mangano would like to be the new boss
mangano smiles gratefully
thank you paul
thats why he betrayed dominic and me to our enemies and sent his own man to kill me in miami
mangano is stunned
but i leave it to my people to deal with that and choose their own boss
and even though its my right i wont take revenge mostly because im in a good place mentally and feeling good about me
perplexed i dont know paul
i can see where some people might have a problem with this
i realize that so as an extra token of good faith between us ive taken the liberty of writing down everything i know and putting it in a safe deposit
box in case anything happens to me or my family
theres a long tense silence while the other bosses consider all this
then finally i dont know what anybody else thinks but i say good luck and god bless paul
good luck paul
they all raise their glasses and toast vitti
ben raises his glass to vitti and drinks
to vitti well done
vitti smiles at him and drinks
ben and vitti come out of the building and cross to the car
jelly is waiting iron mike has the motor running and jimmy is in the front seat with him
sindone and mangano come out with guns drawn flanked by two wise guys
vitti and his crew turn and face sindone and mangano across the parking lot
i dont want to do this primo
you dont want to do this
thats fuckin rich
what did you think you could just quit and walk away
you think this is a fuckin civil service job
what are you crazy
to mangano hey carlo tell me
you gonna stab me in the back like the piece of shit i always knew you were
mangano stares at him cold and hard
im not gonna stab you in the back paul
i want to see your face when i do it
i dont think so
calls out mo mo
mo mo stands up from behind a car pointing a shotgun at mangano and sindone
johnny bigs steps out from behind a shed holding an assault rifle
the back of a van opens to reveal eddie cokes and tuna manning a military air cooled machine gun on a tripod
its over primo
now get the fuck outta here
sindone glares at him then lowers his gun turns and starts to walk back into the building joined by mangano and the soldiers
vitti and ben relax
i was going to bring a machine gun but i dont have one
of course we havent opened the wedding gifts yet
suddenly sindone whirls and fires at vitti
ben staggers in front of vitti and takes the bullet in the shoulder
the assembled bosses hear the sound of gunfire outside
zello looks at baldassare
the bosses all jump up and run for the exits
as the gun battle continues sindone jumps into a car and tries to escape but eddie cokes rips his car with the machine gun stopping it dead
an nypd armored assault vehicle bursts through the gates
police cruisers and swat vans come racing up to the scene then from out of the sky the fbi helicopter descends blaring a warning
on a loudspeaker drop your weapons and lie facedown on the ground
drop your weapons and lie facedown on the ground
bosses and fat capos go running through the alleys and clambering over fences in their silk suits and expensive loafers
agent ricci wearing a flak jacket and fbi baseball cap has sindone down on the ground with his foot on primos neck and a
aimed at his head
screaming dont move
dont you fucking move
take a pill robocop
vitti is tending to ben who is on the ground leaning against the side of the limo
deeply moved i cant believe it
you took a bullet for me
what doctor ever did that much for a patient
ill never forget that
paul i tripped
you tripped over your unconscious
its a beautiful summer day
convicts are playing basketball and lounging in the yard
ben in a sport coat and vitti in prison whites are sitting around in a circle with several other convicts
donny a heavyweight con with a shaved head and numerous tattoos is talking
i dont think my mother really listens when i talk
she never listened
and how does that make you feel

suddenly vulnerable yes i do
paul what would you say about what donnys feeling
donny when youre thirsty you dont go to the wall you go to the well

ben is proud of vittis new sensitivity

ben and vitti have just left the therapy group

we say you had a corrective emotional experience

ben and laura are dancing in the yard
paper lanterns are hung here and there
a bottle of champagne sits open on the table
a great tony bennett song can be heard playing
i just cant get used to it
its been three weeks since the last time you were kidnapped

they kiss as the song ends
ben turns and speaks to someone o
