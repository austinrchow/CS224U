a radiant shiny something dazzling in extreme closeup
camera very slowly pulls back
the sparkling surface turns out to be a lot of carats
we see the stone then the ring then suddenly in b
something huge sweeps by
reveal a mechanical claw above the ring hanging from a crane
the ring sits in a sea of tiny dolls joke eyeballs and other carnival junk
the claw descends on the ring again and again sometimes catching it for a moment then tragically dropping it accompanied by oohs and aahs o
of hope and disap pointment
intercut with the hands of a young black man working the controls
the eyes of a young black woman watching him work
another guys hands digging in his pocket for change
quarters going into the slot
thisll never work tommy
be positive armando
course it will
the claw inadvertently snags a rabbits foot
see what a lucky fuck i am
he dont mean the ring hon he means the whole plan
so do i
the claw catches the ring and closes on it
quick cuts of their faces as the crane rises
a very pretty lady
a beefy latino with a two day beard
then his exceptional smile
he gets the ring
okay one down one to go
returning to the claw you got quarters loretta
the distinguished gentleman rev
the smell of money
valets in foreign legion khakis greeting arriving luxury cars
a big crowd of guests at a cocktail reception
a lot of lime jackets cherry trousers and blue hair
people wear name tags
on tommy in pastel bow tie and full waiter drag con firming orders for a group of guests
he speaks in a thats a diet ginger ale an extra spicy virgin mary no salt a club soda good choice a lime rickey and a bourbon and a planters
five people five drinks
tommy turns away looking toward the entrance to the room
glittering on lorettas finger
loretta stunning in designer clothing and accessories enters
her looks attract looks
tommy maintaining his vantage point repeats another order this time in a heavy carribean accent thats a vodka tonic a pellegrino lime and no ice a gin gibson straight up
with ex tra onions i am also fond of de onions and a chardonnary spritzer
also with extra onions no no do not worry that is just a little joke
there will be no onions whatsoever in your spritzer
he laughs hugely rather amused with himself
the guests arent
you dont need to write it down
the distinguished gentleman rev
do not make me laugh
he laughs hugely turns takes two steps away and makes absolutely no effort to get their drinks
he looks toward the door
loretta approaches the function room where pert debbie wearing a johnson for congress button staffs a felt covered table
on a nearby easel a photo of a silver haired man with a legend in blue and gold jeff johnson
eurotrash accent im not too late am i dear
extending a hand hello darling alma preston how are you today

loretta pulls a mont blanc pen and a checkbook from her bag
no honey i dont think you do we just got in last night from our place in barbados how much is it
five hundred a person
writing yes were just down the beach from mick jagger and jerry

a pleased smile from debbie
loretta opens the check book flashing the immense ring in front of debbie
um thats a lovely ring
the distinguished gentleman rev

on tommy watching loretta
a guest standing just behind tommy wearing mrs
zeke bridges name tag watches jeff johnson gladhand the room robustly
i hear they had him open for six hours
zeke a very fat cigar smoker marvels at johnsons appearance
chuckling the sum bitch looks terrific
tommy eavesdropping joins zekes chuckle which unfor tunately turns into a wheeze and then a cough
zeke turns to tommy

bourbon straight up and a perrier rocks for the lady
the distinguished gentleman rev
fire and ice
but may i suggest you make that a double sir
after all so many guests so few of me who knows when i may be back

at the entrance loretta pauses before going into the room
you know where the powder room is hon
i should freshen my face before i go in
its just over there
on jeff johnson with his well groomed wife vera and a barrel chested man in full resort wear wearing an olaf andersen name tag
so how the heck are you olaf
i should be asking how you are congressman
johnson pats his chest and smiles at vera
this old ticker never felt better
its good to see you back on your feet jeff
we need you in washington
inconspicuously a pretty young redhead whispers to vera
this is jennifer johnsons administrative assistant his aa
hows that granddaughter of yours olaf
ready for the olympics
shell be thrilled you asked after her
in the hallway loretta emerges from the ladies room
catches a spike heel
recovers her balance
then frantically searches her hands and clothes screams and gets down on hands and knees
the distinguished gentleman rev
oh my god
debbie rushes over to her
whats the matter
hyperventilating my my ring
i took it off in the ladies room to wash my hands
i was just putting it on i must have dropped it

in the function room tommy maintains his watch on loretta
zeke bridges taps tommy on the shoulder
hey what about our drinks
tommy instantly assumes an angry young street black yeah

you already took our order
that wasnt me
you must be thinking of jamal
what you want
bourbon straight up and a perrier rocks
snorts derisively hunh
he walks two steps
and once again makes no attempt to get the drinks
zeke returns to jeff johnson
the distinguished gentleman rev
dont get me wrong jeff
pyramid insurance doesnt want special breaks
i just think we ought to be able to set our own rates without uncle sam sticking his nose in our business
johnson signals jennifer to come over
do you know my aa
zeke bridges this is jennifer my administrative assistant
zekes been a tremendous help to us
id like you to listen to his view on health insurance
id be very happy to

in the hallway loretta and debbie are on hands and knees still looking
a pair of shoes comes into frame
they look up at a bullet headed man
bruno handler hotel security
oh my god
now just calm down maam
can you describe the ring
its a diamond ring
a big diamond ring
oh my christ
debbie takes bruno aside
i saw it
it must be like eight carats
she says it was a quarter of a million dollars
bruno turns back to loretta trying to calm her
the distinguished gentleman rev
now is the ring insured
of course its insured
but you know how it works if i report it theyll cancel me
and i dont want another ring
i need this ring
the ring carlos gave me
bruno turns speaks into the walkie talkie hes carrying
where the fuck is housekeeping
i called for those dickheads ninety seconds ago
in the function room the guests have gathered to hear johnson speak
as andersen introduces him tommy con tinues eyeing loretta
now i wont run through jeffs record hes been in congress twenty years and ive only got two minutes
ill just say this when those of us in pharmaceuticals or agribusiness or insurance or indicating himself utilities or you name it when weve needed him jeffs been there for
and weve been there for jeff too we raised a hundred thousand dollars today
without further ado our man in washington jefferson davis johnson
in the hallway debbie hears the applause o

loretta mascara smeared gets up as does bruno
i cant go in there like this
ill pay a ten thousand dollar reward for anybody who finds my ring
just dont tell carlos
suddenly grim hell kill me
the distinguished gentleman rev
in the function room as johnson takes questions tommy slips out
what do you make of all this campaign reform business jeff
well yknow ernie
these days everyones down on the political action committees and so called special interests
but heck i think you and fran have a right to participate in our democracy in exactly the way youre doing today
im in congress to represent you
i dont want any so called reform to take that power away from you
in the hallway bruno issues orders to two maintenance men
i want every heating grate opened and inspected
i want every air conditioning duct vacuumed
do you understand what im saying
as he speaks bruno sees tommy pass through the hallway spot something on the floor
pick it up
furtive ly put it in his pocket
and walk rapidly toward the door to the kitchens
running after him hey you

bruno puts an arm on tommy
tommy instantly assumes a frantic wimpy craven persona along wth his carribbean no

my green card is in the mail
the distinguished gentleman rev

a hundred and five
bruno snorts agreement goes for his wallet
tommy goes gor the ring
then suddenly leaps back in a cringe
its a trick
you will call me a thief and send me back and the security police will make me stand on my head in the guano pit
i have seen such things on bruno snaps and grabs tommy by the collar
jesus im not trying to trick you
it is a trap
i must turn this over to police
he starts to leave
bruno grabs him
the distinguished gentleman rev
a valuable ring is missing and theres thousands of dollars in reward money waiting
so youd better fork over
how big is this
um five hundred dollars
you said thousands
a thousand dollars
no no no
you said thousands
with an s
this is plural
this means two or more thousands
deep sigh okay you win
two or more
brunos had enough his grip tightens around tommys neck
just making a point
in hotel lobby at the cashiers desk bruno slides a check to the cashier who counts a stack of bills
bruno picks up a house phone dials
armando still unshaven answers the ringing phone
intercut with bruno in the lobby
hello may i speak with ms
the distinguished gentleman rev
shes in the bathroom
this is carlos
can i take a message
smiling to himself no thanks ill call back
armando hangs up the phone and exits the hotel room
bruno crosses to the far side of the lobby where tommy waits inconspicuously
he gives him the money
tommy gives him ring
now get back to work
as tommy heads back to the function room bruno picks up a house phone dials listens
he dials again listens
he dials the operator
this is bruno in security
put me through to there must be something wrong with the line i cant get an answer
what do you mean theres no one in
i just spoke to them
no ones registered in
are you sure
well check again
he hangs up looks at the ring and realizes hes been taken
his face twisting with rage he hurries after tommy
on tommy moving swiftly through the function room toward an exit
zeke bridges grabs him
where the hell are our drinks
surprised tommy opts for an east indian accent
you were the sloe gin fizz and the mango daquiri
with perhaps a small umbrella for the lady
bourbon neat and a perrier dammit
and would you still be wanting the umbrella then
the distinguished gentleman rev
as zekes face flushes in anger tommy sees bruno come into the room blood in his eye
tommy turns sharply and heads out the terrace doors to the tommy conceals himself behind a pillar across the court yard away from the guests
but from another direction johnson and andersen approach arm in arm and sit on a bench by the pillar
olaf theres something i wanted to sound you out on
as a special friend
tommy moves away from the pillar sees bruno roaming the terrace and retreats
im thinking of retiring from congress
andersens eyes widen in astonishment
im thinking maybe i wont run
maybe i should listen more indicating his heart to this
really appreciate these years
sail around the world
enjoy the finer things of life
listen to me
you cant retire
florida needs you
i need you
i need you on rates
i need you on regulations
i need you on those environmental nutcases olaf if i retire this year i get to keep all the money left over in my campaign treasury
comes to a very tidy nest egg
the distinguished gentleman rev
one point three million
chuckles its called the grandfather loophole
bruno has gone
but tommy stays
his eyes light up at the money
come on jeff
look at what youd be giving up
going to the best resorts in the world and calling it official business
golfing and skiing and fishing and never picking up a tab
and jeff theres no aphrodisiac like power
you can have some of the most intelligent attractive women in the country
youve got it made
oh i suppose that one point three may seem like spare change to the head of gulf coast power but to a country boy like me okay jeff
i get it
theres a little software company thats about to go through the roof
johnson smiles at the direction the conversation is taking
on tommy also smiling in admiration at the transaction going down
a few thousand worth of stock options would stand to make you quite a pile
as long as your blind trust buys them youre clean the sec cant shake a stick at you
half a million easy and thats just a start
well if you put it like that
i now see i have a duty to continue my career in public service
johnson stands puts his arm on andersen
tommy emerges shakes his head and laughs
im in the wrong business
the distinguished gentleman rev
a ramshackle bait shack paint peeling on the inland waterway
at the rear of the shack armando shoots hoops into a tattered net
loretta back in jeans looks at her watch
a bondo patched econoline van pulls up
tommy jumps out big smile
he gives loretta an energetic round of the best lil roper in america
but she doesnt want the charm
you took your time
cops bust you tommy
he pulls out the wad of bills
their faces brighten considerably
that look like busted
the illuminated dome of the capitol
camera roams the well hung walls
from the photos and memorabilia we realize that we are in the office of rep
in the reflections on the frames we glimpse some movement on the desk explaining the considerable breathing and moaning o
oh my god
oh my god
but then a strange gurgling sound o
escapes from johnson
a silent beat
then a horrified cry
jennifer rises oh my god
the distinguished gentleman rev
the congregation is singing
we see the widow johnson
at her side in the aisle seat a powerful man with bushy eyebrows about in a three piece suit and watch chain congressman dick dodge
the hymn ends
dodge steps up to the pulpit
it was my honor to serve in congress with jeff johnson for a generation
no one could have been a better legislator
no one could have been a finer husband and father
and now he presses the tips of his fingers together and looks skyward as if communing with his memory of the deceased
and now god has called his servant home
angle on jennifer in black
we will miss him
but we are grateful that his passing was so peaceful and so like him working late into the night at his desk the consummate public servant
vera sneaks a look at jennifer who is poker faced
on the veranda of the gracious home mourners pay respects to the family
dodge puts a gentle hand on the widows shoulder and draws her aside
he throws a look at jennifer who joins them
vera i know youre still in shock from jeffs
but we have to talk about his seat
vera stares at jennifer
she knows the score
johnson if youd like to discuss this in private you can stay whats the difference
vera id like you to announce that youre going to run for congress
let a few days pass to show proper respect
but next week i want to stand next to you at a press conference where you declare for jeffs seat in the house
no dick no
theres nothing to be afraid of vera
with your name you cant lose
people around these parts are so used to voting for jeff johnson why mrs
jeff johnson would win in a walk
dick i was a washington wife for twenty years
twenty years of potomac bullshit is plenty for one lifetime
vera were talking about becoming a member of congress
were talking about a sure thing
the distinguished gentleman rev
dont worry about running the office ill be there night and day
im sure you would dear
but i couldnt give you the same job satisfaction jeff gave you
jennifer embarrassed didnt know vera knew
nor did dodge
a retirement community in the florida sunshine
a supermarket shopping cart full of groceries tied with a big bow rolls out pushed by tommy
loretta accompanies him
tommy buzzes at a door
its answered by tommys grandma a limber lady in leggings and a bright top
she sees the groceries kisses him
this is very sweet of you darling
but you shouldnt have done it
where did you get the money
you dont want to know
tommy and loretta are watching the track results on the local tv news
tommy playing solitaire shuffles bril liantly
grandma comes in from the kitchen shaking her head
how did i end up with a thief for a grandson
grandma i told you
im not a thief
im a con man
but also a crook
the distinguished gentleman rev
but i only con crooks grandma
you cant con an honest man
only somebody who wants something for nothing
pause but the good lord must have been fond of pigeons because he made so many of them
sometimes i just wish you were more like your daddy
you mean dead
i mean someone who made something of himself
pointing at tv look
its the ad
a cheap tv spot a busty blonde in a skimpy outfit tossing her hair and pouting
fake swedish accent i am inga
im here from sweden and im s o o lonely
i need a man
and so do my girlfriends
scantily clad babes to match the names
loretta speaks along with the v
maria my hotblooded spanish friend
babette the parisian pussycat
and many others
so call the girls of many nations at nato
swedish accent so what do you think of my accent grandma
compared to what
loretta why dont you go baste the turkey
the distinguished gentleman rev
loretta gets up and goes for the kitchen
we hear a high pitched electronic warble
tommy reaches into lorettas purse and pulls out a cellular phone
calls to loretta see
i told you tv advertising works
he opens the phone and speaks in a toneless recording like voice
you have reached girls of many nations
for hot blooded italian wildcats press one now
nothing for perky american cheerleaders press two now
nothing for a sultry swedish love goddess press three now
he covers the mouthpiece and calls to loretta
guy wants to speak to inga
tell him to call back
tommy grins mischievously and speaks into the phone in the husky voice of a swedish woman
ja this is inga
how are you tonight
you are feeling naughty
thats all right you have your what in a bowl of oatmeal
yes that is very naughty and maybe a little sick
the distinguished gentleman rev
its my husband lars
hes home early i must go before you want to talk to lars too
so you like to talk dirty out of both sides of your mouth
normal voice man you are one twisted bastard
laughing he hangs up
sorry grandma just getting a third minute out of him
he clicks off the phone and slams it back into lorettas purse
loretta meanwhile has reappeared
you hung up on paul
hes one of my best customers
i cant believe any relative of mine does that for a living
its only my voice
they never actually meet me
so my granddaughter talks dirty for a living and my grandsons a thief
whats up grandma
are you embarrassed to show my picture around the pool
of course im not
she goes to her sewing basket and pulls something from it
she unfolds it a long piece of needlepoint shes been working on
it spells out tommys full name thomas jefferson johnson
the distinguished gentleman rev
look what these arthritic hands been doing
make me proud of you tommy
make me proud of the name you carry
in the silence between them that follows we hear the tv
im ned grable vice president and general manager of wfla
we think mrs
jeff johnson did the right thing in not running for the congressional seat left vacant by her husbands death
the editorial catches grandmas attention
jeff johnsons name may still be magic
but itll take more than the magic of name recognition to solve our regions problems
im ned grable
lordy what a notion
people have to be some boobs just to vote for someone because their name is johnson
tommys eyes widen
i remember once back in georgia they even elected a dead man
his name was still on the ballot people were just used to voting for him
what did you say grandma
homer the proprietor of homers pit stop wearing fuel smeared overalls is dieseling a customers boat down by the water
get your ass over here
the distinguished gentleman rev
up by the racks of junk food and beer and pails of fish slop tommy and armando await homer

he takes a dramatic pause then launches into a come to jesus speech
my friends i want to tell you about a town where the streets are paved with gold
this is a town where the marks give you money before you ask

tommy produces a sheaf of xeroxes and pamphlets
i found this shit in the library

the distinguished gentleman rev
tommy and van dyke are seated opposite hattie rifkin a high energy woman s with a frizz of white curls
so what brings you here

oh the usual sacrifical lamb
probably sylvia roland
she just lost her husband she needs to meet new people
i want to run
well i want to run too but with this plastic hip its not gonna happen
tommy breaks up
in spite of himself hes charmed by the salty old babe
what i mean is
id like to run for congress on the silver fox ticket
i care about you and your issues
yeah thats what my son says
but does he call
anyway what makes you think a group of alter cockers are gonna support a man who hasnt clipped his first nose hair yet
because i can win
a democrat can win
a republican can win
a silver fox can only make a symbolic point
rifkin if you give me a ballot line and if i can get support from

hattie cracks up
tommy leans over and translates for van dyke she said if my grandmother had balls shed be my grandfather
recovering where the hell did you learn to speak yiddish
the same place i learned to hustle shtarkers at gin rummy
from morris elfbein
the gin king of miami beach

pan to tommy training a home video camera on a poster that reads jeff johnson for congress
the distinguished gentleman rev
very white were not going to show you jeff johnson waving a flag
were not going to show you jeff johnson kissing babies
were not going to show you jeff johnson doing anything because you already know what jeff johnson can do
the poster fills the screen
tomorrow vote for jeff johnson
the name you know
a very puzzled vera johnson watches the ad on tv
the congressional district sleeps
but in the darkness a kind of d day onslaught is under way
quick super imposed cuts of tommys secret army of silver foxes opening crates fanning through parking lots swarming over lawns driving in stakes tacking up posters everywhere
include tommy climbing a telephone pole
armando shinnying up a light pole across the street
loretta and van dyke pulling on a rope
which hoists a huge bundle to tommy
who opens and unfolds it
and gets an end through the air to armando
they unfurl the biggest banner imaginable
camera tilts down
every square inch of town seems to have been plastered with johnson for congress material
its on billboards bumpers bus shelters balloons banners utility poles
all in the late congressmans signature design
the econoline now a johnson ad on wheels ghetto blasters mounted front and back on the roof rolls by a jewish deli a soul food joint
a whitebread country club
a chinese restaurant
at each tommys amplified voice says the distinguished gentleman rev
the name you know
in a different appropriate accent
in front of a polling place van dyke pulls up in a hearse with an elect johnson banner
so driving muscle cars do armando homer and loretta tommys get out the vote fleet
exhilarated senior citizens pile out led by hattie
an ordinary couple s sign the registration book then enter adjacent voting carrels
after a moment the husband leans out
who are we voting for congress
dont we always vote for johnson
thats it johnson

tricia i believe congressman elect johnson is coming this way
for the first time we see tommy wearing a beautifully cut suit
hes instantly engulfed by lights cameras and supporters
an amazed cameraman watching tommy whispers to a producer
jesus hes not
i actually voted for the guy
i thought he was jeff johnson
tommy jumps onto a bench
applause from his supporters
thank you thank you all of you for your help
give yourself a round of applause
as applause continues o
camera pans from reporter to reporter to reporter their mikes bearing the call letters of different channels
on grandma being interviewed
she wears a johnson for congress button and speaks with manifest pride
ive never been so proud in all my life
he was always such a good boy
well i think he meant well
sometimes well he was a clean child
thats important i think
pan to florida reporter doing a stand up
then in massachusetts there was a guy named kennedy who got elected but he wasnt really a kennedy
the distinguished gentleman rev
a lot of dead incumbents get re elected actually
its an american tradition
speaking meaningfully with great sincerity he shows a gift for political discourse
we ran a positive campaign
we campaigned on the issues
the issue is leadership
leadership for the future
ask not what you can do for your country
the people have spoken
the only thing we have to fear is fear itself
if you cant stand the heat stay out of the kitchen
live free or die
and in conclusion
read my lips

the bridge over the potomac has a classic view of the lincoln memorial and the washington monument
their taxi drives by
tommy and cronies get out of a cab and bound up the grand flight of stairs
the capitol dome

at an elevator with a sign above it members only they stop

looking puzzled they make their way up a drab stairwell
on one side of the hallway the windows give out on a brutally ugly courtyard
on the other side of the hall are cages windowless storage bins behind metal fences crammed with junk and an occasional xerox machine mr
coffee and pitiful staffer at a tiny desk
tommy opens the door to
tommys office is a small dark garret with dirty car peting bare shelves and a pile of bulging canvas u
he heads further into the office
perched on the desk reinhardt

the distinguished gentleman rev
a big crowd slowly makes its way along a red carpet to the party
tommy was born to wear a tux
in his lapel a red and gold eagle pin
on his arm loretta in a dramatic shoulderless and nearly backless gown with three quarter gloves
the other women in sight are far more conserva tively dressed

especially from their home state

she pronounces the word so carefully it sounds lewd

a darkened hallway
a hand lettered sign by a door reads dodge

hundreds of business cards
an expert riffle a one handed cut and tommy deals lightning fast a perfect diamond formation with two cards in the middle

tommy kisses grandma
intercut tommys cronies applauding
on the floor tommy dries grandmas tears with a finger
its just that im so happy you straightened out
tommy smiles ambiguously
as applause continues his eyes roam the room and make contact with dick dodge standing at one of the leadership tables
tommy winks conspiratorially at him
theres such diabolical glee in it it even takes dodge aback
a beautiful black woman s walks briskly down the busy cannon corridors
theres intelligence in her eyes and fire
the distinguished gentleman rev
she makes her way down the corridor exchanging ad lib greetings glancing in at the sedate receptions and drawing closer to the source of the reggae o
she looks in
its packed mainly with men
everyone has drinks and talks noisily
it looks like a fraternity smoker for lobbyists
music comes from a boom box
the bar a tablecloth over some desks is lavishly stocked
so are the bookcases which now look like liquor store shelves
angle on loretta in a cocktail dress and a hello my name is miss loretta badge staffing a little table handing celia a name tag
celias hands print celia kirby
back to scene on tommy and reinhardt talking with a its an informal breakfast
you give us your views we give you bacon and eggs plus a couple of thousand dollar honorarium

the tommy johnson foundation
savoring the word honorarium
i like that
loretta appears with a platter of food
uh no thanks

the distinguished gentleman rev
i think ill pass
tommy steers her aside and takes a roll of soggy toothpick impaled herring
what is this
wheres the cheese
the cheese guy didnt return my call
so i called the guy at the american smoked fish institute
she points at the food table
theres nothing but a few boxes of crackers and two huge mounds of herring one white one pink
the centerpiece is a large smoked fish eyes staring accusingly
oh thats just wonderful
sixty heavy hitters drop in and im feeding em cat food
he breaks off as celia comes into view in the doorway behind
tommy picks her up on his radar
well talk about this later
we follow tommy through the crowd until he reaches celia

the distinguished gentleman rev
tongue in cheek well it is a difficult assignment look at what we cover energy health telecommunications environment
the committee is constantly beset by a swarm of special interests
these are powerful people theyve got all the money in the world and theyre not shy about using it
this is very good news
most members would give their right nut for it
so what do you want from me dick
i just want you to smile for the cameras
the committee members all white males except tommy mill around awaiting the start of the hearings
as the tv cameras whir dodge shakes tommys hand warmly
big smiles and an explosion of flashbulbs
dodge breaks off and tommy drifts over to reinhardt
indicating dais so congressman welcome to the honey pot
you should be one happy freshman
well im not
one thing ive learned is when somebody gives you something for nothing the nothing aint nothing
what is it
reinhardt puts his hand on tommys shoulders
the distinguished gentleman rev
congressman i dont want you to take this the wrong way but
and i mean that in the nicest possible way
dodge wants to run for speaker
and he aint gonna make it without votes from the black caucus
suddenly dodge reappears
he throws his arm around tommys shoulders
tommy someone i want you to meet
dodge steers tj to a preppy looking man at the witness table barclay skeeter warburton
skeeter do you know tommy johnson

tommy this is barclay warburton
pleased to meet you barclay
warburtons voice is aristocratic a la george plimpton

dodge chuckles shakes his head in mock rebuke
tommy takes his seat at the lower dais smiles at the members on his left and right
the distinguished gentleman rev
on the upper dais dodge gavels
this epa oversight hearing of the committee on power and industry will come to order
id like to welcome our first witness the distinguished administrator of the environmental protection agency
warburton nods but before i do i note that a new member is joining us today the distinguished gentleman from florida
the biggest explosion of flashes yet
and as the motor drives whir tommy flashes his biggest smile yet
tommys office walls are now richly hung with plaques awards and framed photos
we see he has been named the pesticide coalitions man of the month
the winner of the national rifle associations achievement award
the motion picture association of americas outstanding young legislator
the liquor is gone
loretta is at the receptionists desk
a lobbyist enters
snack pac snack foods political action committee

the congressman is running just a little bit late
he sits and opens his briefcase
van dyke approaches him with the dignity of a superb butler

tommy rises to speak at a breakfast meeting
the podium bears the seal of the american poultry association
the distinguished gentleman rev
let me start with a confession
i dont know much about poultry
but i do know something about people
and let me tell you i like you people
so when you have something to say about poultry i listen
thank you very much
he sits down to generous applause
on armando in attendance clapping marveling at the response tj gets
capitol hill is actually two worlds the aboveground buildings that visitors and television cameras see and the catacombs the busy tunnels and corridors connecting the congressional office buildings and the
theyre surprisingly unglamorous exposed pipes white washed brick walls dumpsters pizza carry outs and through them move the legislators and their staffs
and here is tommy whistling zippedy doo dah
he loves this place
passing a snack bar he greets the cashier
he blows a kiss to a pretty teller in the credit union
passing the barber shop he calls out to the shoeshine guy
he passes a black telephone man at an open panel of wires
whats up man
whispering sweet sue
third race at santa anita
several lobbyists are now awaiting tommy balancing plates of herring on their knees
some are enjoying it more than others
tommy breezes in
hey how you folks doin good to see you van dyke making you comfortable

saturday night sounds fine
on a door in the house sub basement members only
the regular evening pickup basketball game
even among these ruthless players tommys street moves are outstand ingly down and dirty
his principal accomplice elijah marshall
a standing poker game among the towel and robe clad members
its tommys shuffle and deal
he is convincingly awkward
a bulldog of a man examines his hand tosses two cards in
he assembles his new hand
four fives and an ace
the distinguished gentleman rev
on tommys hand
a pair of threes
the betting starts at a couple of chips and comes round to tommy
he pushes a stack of chips to the center
lets get serious fellas
tommy marshall and the bulldog back in suits exit the members only door and move through the catacombs
i need your help on the ethics bill leon
i want you to co sponsor my amendments
you make a persuasive case eli
that wasnt a yes
courteously ambiguous i promise to give it the attention it deserves
the bulldog gives tommy a friendly squeeze better luck next time son
and leaves them
tommy and marshall continue on
he took six hundred dollars off you that last hand didnt he
yeah hes taking a real shine to me
if i didnt know better id say you lost to him on purpose
nothing wrong with letting the chairman of the ethics committee roll you once in a while
the distinguished gentleman rev
shaking his head you fit in real well up here
so eli how come you havent asked for my help with your amendments
give it a rest tommy
youve got a great jump shot
but everyone knows youre dick dodges boy

thats not true
some people here actually try to do something besides save their own ass

bells begin ringing and lights flashing on all the clocks and sconces down the corridor
three rings pause three rings pause
marshall does a u turn
tommy doesnt follow suit
arent you going to vote
indicating clocks vote
is that what that is
we got a pool going in the office on when itll go off next
the distinguished gentleman rev
its called gucci gulch
the lobby just outside the doors to the house chamber is pandemonium a sea of lobbyists lawyers pacmen members and staffers urgently trying to find their masters and signal them
thumbs up or down
tommy enters sweeps the room with his eyes looking for reinhardt shrugs then goes through the doors onto the floor
tommy goes to a console on the rear of a seat
a blue light says open
tommy inserts a card it looks like an electronic hotel key
red green and amber lights at buttons labeled nay yea and pres
tommy shrugs pushes nay
as tommy heads away he passes a class trip a dozen fifth graders and their teacher who hails him
excuse me congressman
do you have a moment
were from the hawthorne avenue school in union new jersey
we were just learning how a bill becomes a law
indicating the was that a vote
yes it was
and what did you vote
i voted nay
its a terrible bill
itd destroy the fabric of american life
and what was the vote on
tommy hasnt a clue
he calls out to rafe who is among those leaving the chamber
tell these kids what that vote was about
the distinguished gentleman rev
to kids guys got a real knack for explaining things
well it was a motion to reconsider the motion to reconsider
bo passing by intervenes
no it was the rule on amending the reauthorization
overlapping school lunches
youre in excellent hands kids
a noisy restaurant popular with lobbyists
power photos on the wall
people shouting greetings across the room
waiters in long aprons
tommy is having lunch with tommy oconnor
youre a gentleman tommy

the distinguished gentleman rev
and if i vote against the labels i get money from the frozen food guys
and dont forget the ranchers because they get hurt if pepperoni sales go down
laughing in admiration a pepperoni lobby
i love this town

thanks to them my office smelled like smelt for a week
so tommy tell me with all this money on every side how does anything get done
thats the genius of the system
a briefing in progress
flip charts ring binders celia ira a couple of other pro bono types
tommy is riveted by celia
it comes down to a question of what is acceptable risk
are we willing to feed our kids a substance that causes cancer in lab rats
more important who gets to make the decision
bureaucrats and big corporations or the people whose lives depend on it
the distinguished gentleman rev
tommys staff shares one small office
everyones on the phone

celia continues her briefing

sitting at another computer terminal
he is typing in tommys responses which appear on tommys screen
well for merton to apply you have to show high contagion
sounds to me like your contagion rates are no higher than the common clod
reinhardt dives forward to his keyboard and begins correcting his typo
celia looks puzzled
beat must have picked up a little dyslexia over the weekend
well i must say im pretty impressed
youre also impressively pretty
the distinguished gentleman rev
celia is startled
tommy is embarrassed
the dumb compliment hes just spoken was one reinhardt typed on the computer screen
oh come on
excuse me a second
calls out arthur
without explanation he throws his pencil hard out of frame
a jet flies through the sky
tommy and handful of other members listen to their gun lobbyist host
frankly we think the semi automatic has gotten a bad rap
thats why the american sporting gun users pac put together this trip
on tommy and dodge enjoying champagne and hors doeuvres
tommy wearing full l
bean drag wading with the other members
someone blows a shrieking duck call
a flock takes flight
everyone in the group raises their weapons ak s
a burst of gunfire
we see the flock still flying
one duck drops at the feet of the hunters
must have had a heart attack
the distinguished gentleman rev
tommy tees off
he is wearing a veritable pro shop of custom golf gear all emblazoned with logos of corporate sponsors and lobbies
he hits the ball about yards
but more or less perpendicular to the hole
reveal bob hope standing nearby watching
i knew all these congressmen get a slice but i didnt know it was that big
tommy on the phone
did you miss me
celia at her desk in the somewhat ratty pro bono offices
where did you go
oh a fact finding mission some issue conferences a few speaking engagements a charity event
more like the petroleum institute ski cup the nra open the hey
have lunch with me tomorrow
i cant were having a press conference
what is it the ozone layer
the distinguished gentleman rev
laughing toy safety
wait a minute
arent you back early
beaming you remembered
that means you missed me
tommy and celia walk over the bridge to the cherry trees by the tidal basin
so howd you end up hustling for pro bono instead of pesticides
i mean you could have been a big time lawyer right
oh i was for a while
at a hundred grand a year how depressed can you get
doesnt it depress you to lose all the time
mostly it gets me angry
and the anger keeps me going
sure i wouldnt mind winning a few
and its not like im allergic to money
so why do you do it
she skips a stone on the water
god its so embarrassing to come out and say it
i need my life to mean something
the distinguished gentleman rev
this actually hits tommy
celia embarrassed changes the subject
my question is howd you get named after a memorial
grandma like jefferson
yknow life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
its a lot to live up to so i specialized in the last part
and hows the pursuit going
til i met you
the better i do the worse i feel
they have stopped walking
they are standing close together
when can i see you again
how about dinner saturday night
she shakes her head
how about sunday morning
in the pulpit rev
elijah marshall thunders the wages of sin is death
and to the man who values gold over goodness
the lord allows no exemptions
reveal tommy and celia in the front pew
marshall appears to be preaching directly to tommy who wears a slightly sick smile
to the man who shows no respect for the privilege of walking this earth god allows no deductions
the distinguished gentleman rev
and to the man whose pockets are bulging and whose soul is empty
the lord grants no day extension
and when the last trump sounds believe me you will be audited
aside to celia this is one hell of a date
on the steps marshall shakes hands with his congregants
tommy and celia exit the church
marshall takes celia by the hands and kisses her familiarly
tommy is taken aback
glad you could make it
i liked the sermon uncle eli
my niece says youre not half as slimy as i thought
that would put you somewhere between a lizard and a toad
quite a step up
tommy looks from marshall to celia and back again
how could i have missed the family resemblance
whistling happily tommy rounds the corner and heads to his office
the distinguished gentleman rev
ahead of him encamped in the hallway he sees a phalanx of senior citizens many carrying placards and some camera crews
tommy adjusts his tie turns on the charm and approaches
how can i help you folks today
but hattie rifkin and her troops will have none of it
me you dick
the camera lights go on
now let me get this straight
you voted to make people on medicare pay more money to their doctors
the medical association made a persuasive case
ten grand from their pac plus christmas in aspen
shaking his head tommy if im not mistaken you wouldnt be here without the good senior citizens of your district
you got to dance with the girl that brung you son
if you have a bit of business to do do it quietly
in the corridors
in the subcommittees
with little amendments
you mess around on the big ones like medicare youll be dead meat on election day
yeah well then its thanks for the memories and on to the next gig
do you know what your problem is son
you dont think big enough
you have a real knack for this town but you have the soul of a two bit hustler
listen to me tommy
the distinguished gentleman rev
five hundred thirty five members of congress
some are smart and some stupid
some good some not
but all of them son all of them consumed by the single overriding imperative that defines the very washington way of life
getting re elected
wait a minute
youre talkin bout my re election
you dont know what percent of the incumbents who ran last time got re elected do you
and ninety eight before that
its like that election after election
if you dont fuck up you can be here raking it in for life
tommy considers this
then a big smile
i can think of worse places to get life
smiles i knew you had it in you
so how do i get the silver foxes off my ass
oh throw them a bone
why dont you co sponsor a bill for mandatory universal health insurance
the distinguished gentleman rev
whats that mean
itll never pass
a couple of lobbyists await tommy
van dyke mans the desk
in come ellen juba s and her year old daughter mickey whose pony tail sticks out from her florida marlins baseball cap
may i help you
yes im ellen juba
this is my daughter mickey
wed like to see our congressman

loretta comes out and extends a hand
how do you do im miss loretta public liaison for the congressman
my daughter mickey
wed like to see him
yall from the district
up here seein the sights
howd you folks like some gallery passes
go on over and listen to the great debates of our day
she reaches into van dykes desk drawer to get some passes
we dont want to go to the gallery
we want to see congressman johnson
the distinguished gentleman rev
how bout a house key ring for each of you
here see that
isnt that something
turns into a pen
you dont understand
were not tourists
helpfully you arent with some organization are you honey
im a goddam citizen
isnt that enough
were not leaving here till we see him
loretta exchanges a look with the lobbyists who get the picture
she picks up the phone and speaks nonchalantly
could you come out front please
tommy enters carrying an enormous tennis trophy
look what i won
must be that new racket
armando has come out to hear this
there a problem congressman
armando tries to escort her out
get your hands off me
mickey tries to block armando
let go of her you creep
the distinguished gentleman rev
careful she may be armed
get away from her
armando defending himself from mickey manages to knock her hat off
with the hat comes her apparently false pony tail
her skull bears the mark of surgery
mickeys eyes burn into tommys
then she picks up her hat
come on ma
what happened to you
not just me
tommy and his staff listen to the jubas
i was lucky
they said they got it all
im going to be okay
but what about the others
they call it a cancer cluster
oh at first none of us in the neighborhood wanted to believe it but then we all saw it for me it was when the two year old across the
street developed a brain tumor same as mickey
we looked at everything the water the air dump sites insects you name it
but we didnt have to look that far
it was staring us in the face
the distinguished gentleman rev
high voltage power lines
the wires cause magnetic fields and the magnetic fields cause cancer
especially in children
i never heard of that
mickey pulls a stack of journals and xeroxes from her book bag and gives it to her mother who in turn gives the materials to tommy
the studies the numbers its all there
to tommy skeptical youre not actually going to read those are you
caught oh theyll be read
why dont you come see for yourself
tommy has no quick answer
children playing on swings and seesaws in a small public park
a pair of electric power derricks carrying volt lines almost directly overhead
the derricks cast shadows across a nearby school
we see the neighborhood
quite a few for sale signs
a house with a moving sale in progress on the front lawn
on tommy taking it all in
with him are celia and the jubas
five children in the neighborhood have cancer
one more has precancerous lesions
pregnant women around here are scared to death
the distinguished gentleman rev
this is mickeys school
turns out a lot of schools are near power lines
the lands cheap so the schools tend to buy it from the power companies in the first place
but isnt the school district responsible
we asked the superintendent to measure the magnetic field inside the school
he said okay only itll cost forty thousand dollars and what program did we want him to cut that from
were nobody congressman
we need your help
tommy takes celia aside
do you believe it
its impossible to know
no ones really looked into it hard enough
but why isnt it being investigated
why didnt they investigate breast implants all those years
what about those side effects of that sleeping pill halcion
why isnt anything being investigated
its always the same
you got it
the distinguished gentleman rev
there must be something i can do for those people
dont tell me youre actually developing a conscience
shit i hope not itd be a fucking nuisance in congress
no thats not fair
some people on the hill actually believe in things and try to do a decent job and dont forget why they went to washington and who sent them
amazed no shit
remembering oh yeah i met one of those geeks
so what can i do
make a stink
round up some members and hold a press conference
get that committee of yours to hold hearings
haul in in the environmental protection agency the surgeon general the national academy of sciences
get the issue on every breakfast table in america
a press conference
half a dozen congressmen tommy among them
iowa is speaking to the few cameras and reporters
beside him mickey juba and her mother
reinhardt and ceila among the handful of staff and onlookers
this goes beyond personal tragedy
it goes to a public health hazard of unknown proportions
it goes to the right of ordinary people to know all the facts the distinguished gentleman rev
yeah right people ought to know if their neighborhoods are killing them
they turn somewhat surprised to see dick dodge who joins iowa at the microphones a natural leader
what a fine effort this is
i am totally sympathetic
congressional hearings should be scheduled as soon as possible
the american people deserve no less
he puts an arm around mickey
message we care
tommy and celia are watching the press conference on tv
youve found yourself your own hopeless cause
speaking of hopeless causes
they kiss and slide out of frame
an impressive thunderstorm pounds on dodges windows
pouring on the rocks or neat
whatever youre having
the distinguished gentleman rev
well why ruin good bourbon with the taste of some shitty sears icemaker thats what i always say
handing tommy a glass cheers
dodge downs his drink
tommy follows suit
son youre a real comer
i wouldnt be surprised if you ended up in the leadership
ill say this if i were speaker id sleep better with you as a lieutenant
why thank you mr
you know to tell you the truth i didnt know youd be on my side on those power lines
but im not
but you said you were sympathetic of course i did
were all sympathetic to little girls with cancer
but im not sympathetic to holding an inquiry
but you said i know what i said
but that was just a press conference son
i wasnt under oath
the intercom buzzes
into phone yes
bring them right in
hanging up look
its great to get your name in the paper
the distinguished gentleman rev
i bet the gentleman from iowa was all over the evening news in des moines tonight
getting good press letting them know you care thats what its all about
smart move tommy
but thats as far as id go with this if i were you
the door opens
dodge turns to see olaf anderson tommy oconnor and zeke bridges enter
what a surprise
zeke youre looking well good to see you
wheezing good to see you you old sum bitch
chairman thanks for taking the tommy you s
they let you in here
indicating andersen and bridges you folks finally get to press flesh
olaf meet tommy johnson
tommy olaf andersen
chairman of gulf coast power
the boys here have told me a lot about you
yeah i told him you voted for him
they all share a laugh
except for bridges who squints at tommy
glad to meet you son
they tell me youve got a real talent for the game
the distinguished gentleman rev
and this is zeke bridges ceo of pyramid insurance
still puzzling congressman
good to meet you
help me with these would you tommy
he hands tommy a couple of drinks
to zeke chivas on the rocks
taking the drink you look awfully familiar
tommy just smiles
tommy and i were just talking about power lines
yeah what a coincidence
i thought this little party might be for me
to anderson you may not like this
to dodge i think we should hold those hearings
you really fell for the line that parents group fed you didnt you
tommy is struck by dodges intelligence
howd you know i met the parents group
the distinguished gentleman rev
oh i keep my ear to the ground thats what a good politician does
listen tommy why dont we just get olafs take on this
its tragic cancers a terrible thing but theres no way you can link it to power lines
truth is theres a bigger electromagnetic field given off by an electric blanket or a microwave oven than by those derricks
but there are studies that say for every study that says one thing ill show you a study saying another
weve studied it ourselves
theres not a single state health official anywhere in this country who says power lines cause cancer
but what if youre wrong
as tommy persists andersen looks increasingly angry
people didnt use to say smoking causes cancer either
what if the evidence is just building and some day we wake up and discover that your power lines are killing us
exploding kill us
you calling me a murderer
youre saying theres blood on these hands
how dare you talk to me like that you oconnor puts a restraining arm on andersen
calm down olaf calm down he didnt mean it that way did you son
the distinguished gentleman rev
andersen backs off regains his composure
the outburst makes an impression on tommy
tommy im just saying its worth looking into
tommy do you want to move the power lines
do you know how much it would cost to bury them
tens of millions
i dont have that money
the state doesnt have that money
you people up here sure dont have that money
you know whod end up paying for it
folks who sent you here thats who
now howd you like the people in your district to think of you as the putz who tripled their electric bill
you think theyd thank you for that on election day
all im saying is maybe we should hold hearings to look at think for a minute boychik
you hold your hearings
overnight everyone who lives near a substation finds the value of his home in the toilet
you kill the real estate market
you kill the insurance companies
you kill the school district
you kill the local economy
for a smart boy youre not thinking very politically
tommy watches the lightning
maybe i should think about it
the distinguished gentleman rev
yeah the system aint perfect but the fleas come with the dawg
oh by the way tommy on a completely different subject you dont have a state pac yet do you
id like to give you a hundred thousand dollar corporate contribution to start one up
my company would be honored to do the same
can you do that
i thought there were limits oh its all aboveboard we all believe deeply in the rules
its just that the state rules are often more flexible about these things
are you interested
im always interested in the happiness of my constituents
ill drink to that
dodge and andersen shoot each other a look
tommy pulls up in a corvette with florida congressional plates in front of his capitol hill row house
tommy slips into bed next to celia whos half asleep
the distinguished gentleman rev
so what did he say
oh i uh havent asked him yet
celia suddenly looks quite awake
casual it wasnt the right moment
besides i was thinking maybe i ought to line up some other members first you know get my ducks in a row
dick dodge and several other towel clad members
you see that abc poll
president in trouble like that hes liable to do something desperate
some damn fool stunt
declare war on congress more like it
the distinguished gentleman rev
the door opens
eli marshall fully dressed comes in
you shafted me on the ethics bill
the distinguished gentleman rev
hello eli good to see you

its a closed rule
i cant get my amendments on the floor
i cant get a recorded vote

the other members chuckle
cant open your mouth without climbing into the pulpit can you
why dont you just calm down have a massage ive got news for you dick
im going to run against you for speaker

the distinguished gentleman rev
dodge indicates his bloodhound nose

just get him off my back
can you do that for me
thats not a question is it
is there a problem
no no ive still got my right nut i can work with that
a waiter removes an empty pitcher of beer
sure why not
marshall takes a boiled crab from the platter between them places it on the butcher paper in front of him christens it the honorable dick dodge
raises a big wooden mallet and smashes it on the crab smiling
you know eli sometimes people do things they regret
everyone makes mistakes
fact is dicks been under a lot of pressure lately that mans a walking quid quo pro prid quo quid pro quo and you know it
he put you up to this didnt he
the distinguished gentleman rev
what do you mean
dont shit me tommy
youre dick dodges yes man
i know what youre up to
this is damage control
im not a yes man
when dick says no i say no
marshall smashes down again with the mallet
you know why no one on the hill drops a dime on anyone else
mutual assured destruction
our little gentlemans agreement
everybody has something on somebody so nobody has anything on anybody because everybody wants to save his own ass
interested oh yeah
what do they have on you
they think im a pompous ass
shit that aint no secret
reinhardt and loretta about to go in
you sure they dont want to be alone reinhardt
no no i bet theyve been talking about the ethics bill all night
come on loretta youll know how to get marshalls mind off business
shit this place isnt about passing laws any more
it isnt about doing good any more
all its about is
the distinguished gentleman rev
loretta and reinhardt approach their table
well as i live and breathe
tommy is surprised to see them
she flashes a smile at marshall
eli this is loretta hicks from my staff
loretta congressman marshall
pleasure to meet you
you know reinhardt my aa
reinhardt turns to tommy
excuse me congressman could i just do a couple of quick calendar things with you
to loretta would you care for a drink
tell you the truth nothing for me
well when a pretty lady shoots him down an old man knows its time to go home
marshall rises pulling out his car keys
you kids have a good time
indicating pitcher listen you gentlemen look like youve had a few loretta why dont you be a designated driver
loretta stands and takes marshalls keys from him
the distinguished gentleman rev
the good samaritan
good night yall

he gets up
im packing it in
also rising can we talk while i drive you
thanks ill walk
i could use the air
marshall and loretta are singing
marshall and loretta amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me tommy is on foot
marshalls car with its maryland congressional plates pulls over
come on honey no use you getting mugged
marshall and loretta i once was lost but now am found was blind but now i see
tommy in the back cradles his head
as loretta heads into a traffic circle she sees the distinguished gentleman rev
in high sling back heels
turning to look check out the fuck me pumps on that
i gotta get me some shoes like that
with a screech of brakes and a crunch of metal a taxi rear ends them slamming marshalls car into a lamppost
the taxi driver looks at the wreck for a moment
then he lays rubber and squeals away
on the back floor tommy stirs
seems to be okay
lifts himself to see up front
the windshield is smashed
loretta and marshall are both unconscious
tommy climbs into the front but cant get the door open
he kicks out a broken window and climbs through
he runs to a phone on the corner and dials
i need an ambulance right away
in the car no motion from loretta or marshall
at the phone he dials another number
dodge tommy johnson here sorry to call at this hour is dick back from the gridiron dinner yet
could i speak with him for just a moment
dodge is in bed
she hands the phone to dodge whos in white tie and tails looking more sinister than splendid
the distinguished gentleman rev
into phone whats wrong
intercut tommy and dodge
how did you know
good news doesnt come at this hour
i went out with marshall
we got into an accident
hes out cold
dodge looks off balance
were you driving
dodge recovers his equilibrium
the girl from your office
shes out too
i dont like the way it looks
you said you wanted to get back into marshalls good graces
well heres an opportunity
tell the ambulance to take you to walter reed
its a privilege they give congressmen
its also the only hospital without a bunch of goddam reporters shtupping the nurses in exchange for leaks
theyll keep it quiet
ill handle the police
you go home and keep your mouth shut
two figures approach one another in the shadows reinhardt and the taxi driver who rear ended marshalls car
the cabbie nods
reinhardt hands him an envelope
the driver inspects the cash
the distinguished gentleman rev
tommy is shaving
he hears the local tv news from the bedroom
and the beltway is bumper to bumper so you might as well take a day of annual leave and enjoy yourself
at the top of the news maryland congressman elijah marshall is in satisfactory condition at walter reed hospital after an overnight accident in the district
tommy bolts into the bedroom
on the television he sees a correspondent doing a stand up
thats right tom
marshall reportedly had alcohol in his blood
also slightly injured was an unidentified woman whom police say has a record in several states for prostitution
tommy looks sick
oh sweet jesus
linda congressman marshall thats reverend marshall isnt it
right you are tom
how this plays into his longstanding campaign to reform congressinoal ethics is now anyones guess
in other news
tommy leaps for his clothes
tommy races down the corridor
ahead of him celia coming out of marshalls room
she freezes at the sight of him
the distinguished gentleman rev
get away from him
he approaches her
and get away from me

god i hate this town the only reason i stay is because i hate it so much
celia get the hell out of here
sitting on the ground backs to us beneath the power lines
a quiet moment
reverse angle two shot
mickey is shuffling a deck of cards
is it thumb over or thumb under
she tries her hand at a false shuffle
not bad kid
youve got potential

tommy looks at her comes to a decision
he takes the deck from her fans it face up pulls all the kings and aces stacks them on top and squares the deck
this is ones called the double duke
how many players
whos the mark
the distinguished gentleman rev
she points to an imaginary poker player
number two over there
tommy smiling calculates something for a moment then gives the deck four shuffles
he hands mickey the cards
she deals out six hands in a circle on the ground
look at the suckers hand
she turns over the hand at number two
it has the four kings
mickey whistles at the hand
look at your hand
she turns over her own hand
it has the four aces
mickey looks at the power lines at the hands at tj
then understanding thats what youre going to do
her face opens into a big smile
lets kick some ass

tommy pow wows with loretta van dyke and armando
aside from a sling loretta looks okay

everyone around here knows our faces
outside a horn sounds o
tommy looks at his watch
the distinguished gentleman rev
right on the nose
he throws open the bay window of the narrow house
just below is a pickup truck with homers pit stop lettered on the side
homer gets out
the others come to the window to see homer still wearing his fuel smeared overalls and shout greetings
now lets get to work
the members are being seated for a hearing
at the dais tommy approaches dodge
a beat as dodge studies tommys face
eli marshall caught his tail in a crack didnt he

the health of americas securities industry the distinguished gentleman rev
reinhardt approaches tommy and slips him a packet of materials
listen reinhardt somethings come up and i dont quite know how to handle it
theres a guy from the epa i dont know him says he wants to see me
out of the office
alone he says
sound of it makes me nervous
id feel better if you were there
you got it jefe
a man waits alone in the shadow of a large statue
in a jacket and tie his stubble shaved off he looks like a plausible government worker
tommy and reinhardt approach
cold i thought youd be alone
hes my aa
he goes where i go
if you can trust me you can trust him
homer eyes reinhardt a moment then continues
congressman i have information i think you may want
its about something going on at the epa
what have you got
i got a wife and three kids and a note on my house thats what i got
the distinguished gentleman rev
laughs nothin comes for nothin in this town do it
to reinhardt you got any cash on you
im kind of light
whispering you cant do that
to homer this stuffs pretty good
in the right hands it could mean a great deal
fifth race at del mar
blueboy is running twenty to one
id take a major position
you have to be shitting me
no not at all my cousin henry spends his days pumping water into horses stomachs and stuffing percodan up their butts
reinhardt is interested in this
and he admires tommys m
after a moment alright
the white house is putting heat on the epa
they want us to announce a major investigation of the relation between power lines and cancer clusters
but didnt the epa already do a study
yeah but when the draft got to the white house they didnt like it
so they brought their own scientists in to kill it
the distinguished gentleman rev
why did the white house change its mind
is there new evidence
yeah their polls have dropped like a rock
they need an issue
this one makes them look good on the environment and they dont have to spend a penny
and what good is this to me
come on congressman in this town information is currency
and advance information is gold
reinhardt nods in agreement
but youve got to move fast
once the white house goes public with this they cant turn back
if your friends at the power company want to kill this investigation theyd better do it now
after homer leaves blueboy
twenty to one
is your cousin henry always right
i aint got no cousin henry
the distinguished gentleman rev
dodge its arthur reinhardt
may i speak to the chairman please
are you sitting down
the longworth room a small circular committee room with an ornate rotunda
the arts caucus breakfast is ending
unless there is further business our caucus stands adjourned
dodge gets up
as he makes to leave tommy comes in
got a minute dick
tommy takes him aside
the room empties except for them
listen dick i heard something
theres got to be some bidness in it
tommy very discreetly gestures with his thumb and palm money
maybe we can go in on it together
the epa is going to make a stink about power lines
the white house is pushing them to do a big study
thats very interesting my friend
ive heard that too
acting surprised nothing gets by do it
tommy touches his nose in tribute to the master
the distinguished gentleman rev
but thank you son im glad you chose to share it with me
we do make quite a team dont we
i i hope it wasnt my press conference that started this
no this is a stunt for the polls
so do you think theres something in it for us
musing if we got the epa off olaf andersens back hed be extremely appreciative
and how do we do that
my committee writes the epas programs
we audit their funds
we confirm their appointees
ive got them by the balls
and youre going to
tommy makes a squeezing gesture grins
oh no not at all just
but its a gray area
whos to say which is which

the distinguished gentleman rev
looks at watch he should be in by now
skeeter warburton of course

dodge passes his secretarys desk on the way into his office
get me the epa administrator please
tommy jogs along the corridor
a tourist family stares at him
he explains his haste with a smile theres a vote on the floor
and ducks into the stairwell
in a chamber crammed with cables the telephone man listens to a handset

dodge continues gaveling
oh yes you can
oconnor said to you quote if thats what you want we can always find a loophole

tommy also stands and produces a video tape

the clapping is considerably sweetened by the panthers and the rest of tommys claque
dodge gauges their reaction gets an inspiration
the storm leaves his face and becomes a smile which he beams on tommy
i thank the distinguished gentleman
and i thank my fellow citizens
our methods in this investigation may have been unorthodox but together indignant at andersen we have exposed a canker at the very heart of democracy
tommy is amazed at dodges survival skills
reinhardt delighted at the turn claps heartily
andersen livid leaps up and shouts at dodge

the distinguished gentleman rev
laughter and applause
dodge bangs the gavel repeatedly
the gentleman is out of order

indicating cameras turn your backs on the whole country
that what you want to do gentlemen
the members remain in place paralyzed
