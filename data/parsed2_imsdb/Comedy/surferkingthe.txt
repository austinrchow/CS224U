written by bernard murray jr page of jaffa a jamaican looking fellow in his early s arrives at water world carrying a dusty cardboard box
there are a few workers milling about setting up the park for opening
he passes eddie a something grounds worker with downs syndrome
smiling nodding jaffa
they do a hand slap maneuver that they have obviously worked out some time in the past
jaffa proceeds up to the customer relations kiosk plops the box on the counter and enters the kiosk
we see him open the box it is full of cds
he pulls winter covers off of an overhead area to reveal a cd player and amplifiers
he starts pushing buttons hes pushed a thousand times and lights come on
he pulls down a microphone and clicks a button to see if it works
he reaches into the box of cds and pulls one out
we see it is sheryl crow
he gets the cd examines it and pops it into the cd player
he once again picks the microphone and flips the switch as he pushes the play button on the cd player
his voice echoes through the park
soak up the sun begins playing
smiling ladies and gentlemen water world will be open in checking his watch twenty six hours and forty three minutes
big mike the parks owner manager a something man who is portly and bald and richard thompson head lifeguard and another guard are on the east side of thunder bay
there is a post with a box on top of it that has a winter cover on it
the guard is standing there with a garden hose page of holding it so the water goes into thunder bay
he is obviously tired and has been standing there a long time
we look back at the massive size of the pool and get the joke
big mike and richard pull off the winter cover
the guard turns to look and the hose turns with him getting big mike wet
they object and he turns back to filling thunder bay
richard moves the guard to a safe distance
big mike blows the dust off of the box at the top of the post and we see it is a large push button
big mike looks at richard who nods go ahead and then pushes the button
they both draw back as if something big should happen but nothing
they look at each other and big mike motions for richard to go over to the wall housing the wave tank for the pool
richard waves ok and big mike pushes the button again
when nothing happens richard whacks the side of the tank with his closed fist
suddenly a huge wave rolls out
nodding his approval big mike checks off an item in his clipboard
we see people working to open the park
the vail precision lawn chair drill team dressed in water world uniforms is setting and arranging chairs in time to the music
they perform precision maneuvers with the chairs as if rifles and cross each other in a timed march to the music
big mike is standing under the fun house structure with a clipboard
he is talking to richard
after talking to big mike richard shakes his head affirmatively and walks off
he glances up to the two guards above and grins
big mike is looking at his clipboard
we see quickly the large water tank above is spilling water a bit indicating it is full
the water tank spills over big mike drenching him
he stands there still angry for a moment then thinks better of it shaking his head and smiling takes his pen and checks ok on his wet clipboard for the
fun house water tank
two guards are looking down at big mike below
one guard begins motioning as if guiding a crane into place
the other guard has his hand poised on a large switch lever
guard one is gesturing more emphatically now closing his hands to indicate almost there
he closes his hands and guard two pulls the lever
page of we are on the road to water world in federal heights colorado
robbie zirpollo is riding with his mother connie sardonically yeah
this is great
i love this plan
drag me kicking and screaming from my happy home in california to some weird place in colorado and say hey thisll be fun robbie
maybe we can go camping
look i know youre not happy about this
but it wasnt my idea for your father to have some kind of mid life crisis and disappear with his secretary to mexico with our life savings
theres no such thing as a secretary anymore
we couldnt afford to sit around waiting any longer to see if he was coming back
i was able to land a good job here
and now thanks to uncle bernie you have this job at the water park
shaking his head grounds crew
what kind of job is that
it sound like the guy who cleans out the coffee pots
bernie says you help keep the park clean sweep up that sort of thing
im sure it wont be so bad
besides a lot of the kids who work at this park go to the same high school youll be going to
you can start the school year with some ready made friends
i had friends in oceanside
i had something to do for the summer
they pass the main water world sign
hanging below it is a banner that says opening tomorrow
hanging out at the beach surfing with your friends is not my idea of something page of to do
this way youll make some money and meet people here
youd best get used to it
this is where we live now
all thanks to dad and his secretary
they have arrived at the front gates of water world kids are in a line leading to a check in canopy kiosk that has a sign saying employee check in
promise me youll give it a try
giving in to the inevitable i will
see you later he shuts the car door and walks over to the end of the line
there are about teenagers in various default street clothes shorts and tees mostly
robbie takes his place in line behind an older taller boy alex who seems to know almost everyone and has made it his personal mission to greet them
back still to robbie and so she says ill have the filet and the lobster
i had to borrow twenty bucks from fitzgerald just to get out of the restaurant
two guys in front of alex are laughing now
further down the line however another voice pops up
waving to alex by the way
where is that twenty bucks
avoiding ohhh hey dougie
ill catch up with you later
turning around to robbie as not to continue the conversation hey how you doin
havent seen you before
page of alex looks in his wallet as do we
it is empty
nodding im robbie
where you workin
i believe its with the grounds crew
whats the matter cant swim
surprised i can swim
well you look old enough to be a guard
i get my license in september
its just that most of the guys on grounds are a little younger than you
most guys your age that can swim are guards
well i just moved here
i guess i missed guard tryouts
youre a guard then
oh no no no
i work concessions
at aokees surf and snack shack
its just as well
the guards are mostly stuck up anyway
the rest of us are the ones who know how to have fun
cant swim huh
listening to speaker on post above what is that
mimicking his perception of surfers surf tunes dude
page of back to his own voice youll get used to it
youll get to where you miss it
i had to buy two cds just to get through the winter
they are now at the front of the line
a teenage girl melissa is sitting at the table with papers and a clipboard
and here we have the fair melissa time clerk extraordinaire
shaking her head no oh alex
am i going to have to put up with your crap for another entire summer
looking upward toward the sky dear melissa
theres nothing about our relationship that couldnt be fixed by us spending a few moments together in the pumphouse behind thunder bay
yeah well from what i hear it would be a brief few moments
not missing a beat my dear you cut me to the quick
check off my name and that of my amigo here mr
handing them cards fill out these emergency cards and turn them in when you pick up your uniforms
pointing over there
to robbie she wants me
turning back to melissa yeeees
finger pointing this year lets clock in only our own time card shall we
page of head shaking to robbie walking together some people have no sense of humor
robbie and alex walk up to yet another line of about or teens
at the front a teenage girl and a teenage guy are behind a counter and handing out uniforms based on a clipboard list
as robbie and alex reach the back of the line tiffany a blond beauty and two other girls brush past them to the front of the line
taken aback breathing in through his nose whoa
who was that
unimpressed putting his hand on robbies shoulder as if to hold him back like a horse that is riled up eeeaasy there big fella
not in your lifetime
wistfully glancing over or mine
so who is she
miss tiffany maxwell daughter of big mike maxwell owner and operator of this here fine water park
we see tiffany and her two friends are quickly given their uniforms by the attendants as they ignore the kids who have waited in line
see princess tiffany and her friends pretty much have the run of the park
her boyfriend is dan peterson a guy we all call cowboy one of the lifeguards
pretty decent guy from what i can tell
but shes a piece of work
your best strategy is to steer clear of her and she wont cause you any trouble
takes in a deep breath page of hmm
they are now at the front of the line
calling back to female uniform aokees
to robbie name
female uniform person has brought a blue hawaiian shirt on a hanger
uh robert zirpollo looks on clipboard grounds
looks at female uniform and female uniform person together ominously grounds
she disappears to the back
to alex so what is this grounds thing anyway
lets just say
you are critical and indispensable to the ongoing operation
flow of things here at the park
he and male uniform guy exchange a knowing glance here you go tiger
you have a pair of green shorts at home
robbie shakes his head no
wear them tomorrow along with this shirt
you need to report to the area just south of surfs up
look for a guy wearing army pants and glasses
ill show him
im going in that page of direction
to robbie with feigned excitement you get to meet the colonel
they walk off
as they walk off we can hear alex in the distance
left right left
aokees is a restaurant near thunder bay
it seats about and is lavishly decorated in a hawaiian surf and ocean motif with surf memorabilia fish nets surfboards and the like
aokee is a large pound plus apparently hawaiian man late twenties early thirties wearing a purple hawaiian shirt blue shorts and a white chefs apron that says kiss the cook
we see him on a pay phone behind the counter
to person on the line david
how you do this to me
i have full staff with you
i save your spot
i was counting on you
listens nods yes yes
but the gap
what you think you do there
are there girls in swimming suits
have you forgotten
listens shaking head tips
do you get tips
listens some more alex walks up
aokee waves to him
he is obviously upset
resigned well come see us this summer eh
youre a good kid
a good worker
yeah you too
aokee hangs up the phone
seems to think there is future in retail
now what i do
im one person short
park opens tomorrow
aokee buries his head in his hands on the counter
thinking you know
i just met a guy thats old page of enough to work here but hes stuck in grounds
perking up good guy
seemed like our kind of people
aokee thinks for a moment
he glances up towards surfs up
it hits both he and alex at the same time
we need to get him before he get his plunger
they take off running
aokee and alex are running together
they get about feet before aokee large man that he is runs out of breath
alex like a boxer in training sort of runs in place keeping loose ready for aokee to catch his wind
off they go again get another feet and the same thing happens
out of breath alex
wheeze you got to go ahead
wheeze stall til i get there
nodding running in place alex takes off and aokee runs again
we see several rolling trash cans lined up in a row along with several janitorial carts filled with cleaning utensils and supplies
the colonel is standing dressed in army fatigue pants and a water world golf shirt with a green water world baseball cap
he is wearing black horn rim glasses thick lenses and carrying a clipboard
lined up as if an army unit are ten grounds kids including robbie who is sixth furthest from the colonel
they are all younger than robbie except one eddie whom we met at the beginning of the film
eddie is standing tall and straight proud to be there
he is nearest the colonel page of looking up from clipboard well it looks like we have a good staff here
yes a good staff
it will be an excellent summer
remember as we go through training today our park is judged by the work we do
if we do it well the people come back
walking up and down the line we have a little tradition here on the grounds crew
rather than having to learn a lot of names many of which i can never hope to pronounce properly each grounds crew member gets a grounds crew nickname
you will be known by that nickname in every way except of course your paycheck and employee records
the colonel looks over his paperwork
lets see what do we have
ok first up is eddie cochran
your grounds crew nickname will be
eddie smiles knowingly
this has been his grounds crew nickname for the last years mostly because he would never answer to anything else and the colonel gave up trying
now crewmembers listen up
eddie here has eight years experience on the grounds crew
why id like to think there isnt anything any situation that eddie hasnt faced
listen to him
learn from him
watch what he does
this man is the finest most conscientious grounds crewman weve ever had
eddie is beaming with pride now
the colonel pulls a brand new toilet plunger from the cart nearby and hands it to eddie
eddie shoulders it as if it were a rifle
the colonel walks down the line
your grounds crew nickname will be
it is all robbie can do not to laugh
the colonel goes on to the next kid skeeter who is tall skinny and goofy looking
skeeters eyes are faced forward but something catches them
his eyes follow an unseen object as we begin to hear a small mosquito
finally his eyes follow it until he looks cross eyed at his own nose
the colonel has taken note of this and is following it too
skeeter can take no more and brushes it off his nose as he makes a face
page of sorry sir
your grounds crew nickname will be
the colonel steps over the cart and gets another new plunger and hands it to skeeter who follows eddies lead
next in line is a short chubby lad snitch
as the colonel approaches him a quick sound of passing gas is heard
the colonel is startled and snitch makes a quick finger motion indicating the culprit is skeeter next to him
looking at the clipboard bradley is it
your grounds crew nickname will be snitch
snitch shows his dismay with a frown
the colonel has run out of new plungers already and is forced to move to one of last years leftovers which look somewhat depressing
he gets one and give it to snitch who looks at it makes a face and decides not to shoulder it
robbie is so depressed he looks like hes about to pass out
his worst fears have been realized
his summer is passing before his eyes
theres only one more person a young year old girl to go before robbie
the colonel addresses her
your grounds crew nickname will be
thinking suddenly alex bursts onto the scene and even he at this point is somewhat out of breath
thinking staring alex isnt it
yes sir colonel
and what a fine staff youve assembled this year
have you told them yet about your army background
well no i didnt think it was
page of interrupting to the grounds kids the colonel here is very modest
did you know that he reorganized the entire process of cleaning and sanitizing an army barracks and its latrines
well it really wasnt much of a
interrupting again wasnt much
again to grounds kids can you just imagine for a moment the germs and bacteria our american soldiers could pick up in an unsanitised army latrine
its impossible to determine just how many lives have been saved thanks to the efforts of this one humble army colonel
well i suppose when you put it that way
to the grounds kids i too came up through the ranks when at age i began my service here at water world learning from this great man
i remember now
what was your grounds nickname
not even sure i remember it myself sir
but i remember much more
did you tell them about the film
to the colonel hygiene makes you happy to the grounds kids every enlisted man in the army has seen it
some by choice
all from the mind of the colonel here
to himself i never forget a grounds nickname
aokee has finally made it now but is of course out of breath again
page of concerned aokee good god man
are you ok
aokee gestures he is fine and does a combination of charades and hawaiian pantomime before he finally speaks
alex gets behind aokee deciding he needs some help feeding him words
quietly behind aokee bureaucratic bumble
an error in the front office
error in front office
aokee stops turn and glares at alex who merely smiles and shrugs
good god man what are you trying to say
alex comes around from behind aokee
its robbie sir
he was supposed to work at aokees and through some crazy mix up he ended up here
looking at clipboard zirpollo
well this is highly irregular
he is flipping though the papers confused
cant pass this up page of most annoying
never happened before
never happened before
exasperated well if he was supposed to be assigned to you well just have to let him go
robbie has caught on and is quick to step out of line and pick up his shirt to be ready to go
to the colonel i was confused myself sir
i had heard i was working for some hawaiian guy
reassuring i promise we go straight to personnel straighten the whole thing out
you wont need to worry
well just have to make do
the colonel goes back to the girl melinda he was about to nickname before the interruption but is staring after alex aokee and robbie as they walk off
he looks at melinda
he looks back at alex company
it hits him
his grounds crew nickname
i remember it now
the entire staff of water world is assembled for a pre opening pep talk from owner big mike maxwell
he wears a water world golf shirt shorts and a crew style marine hat
standing next to him is richard thompson head lifeguard
the workers are sitting on the hill
page of aokee the colonel and other management types are standing off to the side
tiffany and her friends are sitting up front
alex and robbie are sitting together towards the back and robbies grounds t shirt is no longer in his hand but has been replaced by a folded aokees blue hawaiian
there is a lot of noise from everyone talking
motioning to get everyone to settle down okay everybody lets quiet down for a minute
they do and he looks down at his clipboard for those who dont know me my name is michael maxwell and i
sort of run things around here
a chant starts up with affection
big mike smiles this has happened before probably a tradition
again motioning to settle down okay yeah thanks
now i want go over a few basic things
first of all make sure youve all filled out your paperwork with personnel cause nobody gets paid unless they do
come to think of it i suppose its better for me that you dont fill out your paperwork then i dont have to pay you
ill make it optional
if you want to get paid fill out your paperwork
looking at clipboard lets remember the people who come here are our guests and your job is to see they have a safe and fun experience here
lets work together to keep the park clean and safe and well have a great summer together
now with a few words is our head lifeguard richard thompson
another cheer starts up smaller this time which alex starts
big dick big dick
wincing some but not page of surprised motioning to settle down yeah yeah very funny were all very amused
okay many of you have been in training for some time and some of you still have a ways to go
we see a quick shot of some geeky younger guards wearing water wings sharky goggles and noseplugs and looking less than confident
glancing at the water wing group wistfully almost to himself a long ways to go
he looks down at his clipboard
but id like to take a moment to speak mostly to the guards but certainly everyone has a role in this
we can take everything weve learned and distill it down to two simple rules
rule number one he pauses thoughtful for a moment but building into a near rage for effect to impress on everyone
loudly emphatically angry at the thought that anybody might
he stops composing himself
almost quietly rule number two again thoughtful but building to a rage at the thought that this could happen
loudly emphatically dont let anyone else drown
he stops again and regains his composure
almost quietly to the stunned crowd thank you
have a great summer
there is stunned silence for a moment
theyre not sure how to react
page of breaking the silence alright
alex then everyone begins applauding
robbie looks at alex quizzically alex just shrugs
the meeting breaks up
everyone is hurrying around getting ready for opening day
robbie wearing his new blue hawaiian shirt is cutting pineapple
aokee is busy hovering over everyone and cooking chicken on the grill
alex walks in
to robbie hey hey lookin good
blue is your color
beats that stupid t shirt huh
unhappy stressed alex
you are late
come on is opening day
robbie finishes the pineapple and hands the tray to aokee almost spilling it
to robbie and alex you two start setting tables
alex takes a pile of silverware wrapped in napkins and points to robbie to grab a box of sugar packets to refill the dispensers
robbie grabs it quickly enthusiastically but loses his grip and spills the packets on the floor
at that moment audrey a girl in her teens who works at aokees and is stacking plastic cups on the counter accidentally knocks a stack of cups to the ground
ramon a teenage boy who works there is behind the counter
he bends over disappearing and we hear a crash of pots and pans
his head peers up from below the counter sheepishly
aokee turns from the grill looking at all this and has a worried look but smiles and shrugs weakly
to alex gesturing alex
come here a minute
alex comes up close next to him at the grill so they can talk
with intensity alex look
we falling apart
i made you assistant manager this year
go assistant manage
page of agreeing no problem
alex pops a cd out of the rack above the sound system and puts it in the cd player stopping the standard pastoral hawaiian music that has been playing
he turns up the volume some on the amp and goes over to sarah a teenage girl working there and grabs her grass skirt by the velcro removing it with
a velcro rip
sorry sarah but i need to borrow this
how did you know i wear shorts under that
mock surprise rolling his eyes oh puh leeaase
alex walks back out to the dining area everyone is still working
to all ladies and gentlemen may i have your attention please
everyone stops and looks at alex
in exactly minutes hundreds of dripping wet customers with fistfuls of money smelling of chlorine and suntan lotion will be walking in here
and what will they be looking for
as if directing a choir except robbie who doesnt know any better the best teriyaki east of the pacific
again except robbie who doesnt know any better the finest smoothies in the state
now everyones a little tense except me of course
so to help you get in the proper frame of mind and relax we need page of the right soundtrack
to aokee maestro
aokee hits the play button on the cd player
this is little tune i like to call the paradise slide
mouthing with the song as it starts one two a one two three
the music starts and alex now wearing sarahs grass skirt launches into his version of the electric slide hawaiian style
everyone else gets the beat and begins working to the music
aokee is using his spatulas as drum sticks on the overhanging kitchen tools
ramon has inverted an empty pot and is beating it conga drum style
robbie has picked up the sugar packets and alex is dancing and quickly almost casually tossing silverware napkin rolls to robbie as robbie catches them at first with some difficulty
and puts them on the tables
sarah has re stacked the cups and is juggling salt pepper shakers placing them on the tables
audrey chops onions to the beat
on the chorus don ho don ho don ho
don ho don ho don ho
aokee has now taken all the chicken off the grill and comes out from behind the counter dancing
the others form a conga line behind him
on the chorus don ho don ho don ho
don ho don ho don ho
as they go by the tables they put on any missing items
they get into it more and more aokee especially swinging his huge pound guy hips
on the chorus don ho don ho don ho
don ho don ho don ho
as the song ends abruptly aokee bumps a surfboard part of the restaurants decoration with his hip knocking it and another one to the ground
page of there is a loud crash and everyone pauses and looks at aokee waiting to see if he gets mad
aokee looks down at his hip and makes a puppy dog face like i didnt know my hips were that big
everyone claps laughing
aokee takes a bow
robbie and alex are carrying bus tubs loaded with dirty dishes back toward the kitchen from the dining area
aokee is sipping on a smoothie and leaning back on a counter
there are only a few customers in the eating area
they set the tubs down on a counter that passes to the back area
an unseen person takes them into the dishwashing area
to alex and robbie you did good work today
i made you some of my special power smoothies
more customers later wanting dinner before park closes
i cant have you falling asleep on me
to alex alex we are completely out of table stretchers and left handed coffee pots
take robbie and go find some
i think some at the first aid station near surfs up pool
nodding knowingly right
see you in a little while
they walk off carrying their smoothies
robbie and alex are walking past thunder bay concessions area toward the wave carrying and drinking their smoothies
so that was a typical lunch crowd
well its early in the season yet
well get busier
laughing dont worry
youll get used to it
and tips were good right
page of theres nothing like cash money in your pocket
whats that over there
they are coming up on the wave area
oh youll find this ride interesting
the walk up to the wave attraction where kids are surfing in a high water pressure river sheet of water
surf music plays loudly here and kids are doing all kinds of tricks
some riders are good some are not and fall quickly
we also see skeeter and snitch the tall skinny and short chubby grounds kids we met earlier
they are cleaning up around the exit area of the wave
as a rider falls its a lot harder than it looks
i cant imagine its that difficult
to himself no rudder on the board
now this is a place of many wonders
see those guys in line over there
we see some guys that look a little stoned with unusual hair laughing and talking to each other
we call them wave bums
they all have season passes and do little more than ride the wave all day long
some of them get pretty good
alex points up to a fence behind which some smoke appears to be drifting up
thats where they hang out when theyre not riding the wave
dont get too close to them
sniffing contact high
robbie nods understanding
alex points back to the wave
page of and there my friend is another one of the waves features
we see a pretty girl in line to ride
we call them wave babes
and theres a special secret to this ride
with that alex walks over to bob a guy in his late teens wearing a security golf shirt
he is standing and looking off in a different direction
can i borrow your radio a minute
he hands him the radio and alex is back with robbie
into radio hey frank its alex
alex waves and frank the guard watching the wave waves back
heard through the radio yo alex
into radio listen you have a possible code
to robbie means a hottie
to radio shes up next
a free chicken sandwich and a smoothie if you bounce up the pressure a bit
heard through radio you got it bud
but two smoothies
to robbie he knows my weak spot
to radio two volcanos and a chicken sandwich
heard through radio time to go to ludicrous speed
page of we see frank push forward on a handle next to him that seems to resemble the throttle on a speedboat
the ambient noise from the wave is noticeably higher
the wave babe jumps into the water with the board
skeeter and snitch are still cleaning near the exit
to robbie still holding the radio watch and wait
they look intently at the wave babe who is pretty good even with the increased water flow
but after a few deft moves she falls
alex looks and sees what he is looking for
we look back at the wave babe but the water is obscuring our view
we then see a medium shot of skeeter and snitch
the wave babe walks past them carrying a board but we dont see below her waist the board obscures our view
snitch sees and freezes dumbstruck
skeeter is looking down at the grate where the wave water drains
he reaches down and pulls something out and turns to the wave babe walking away
unaffected excuse me
finally she turns
we see her but just a flash of her from the back as the board covers her waist area
she is puzzled by this grounds kid
holding up the bottom to her swimsuit is this yours
she looks down behind the board and reacts
she bites her lower lip winces and nods yes
skeeter hands her her swimsuit and she looks around and backs away towards a towel hanging from the fence nearby
snitch is still frozen stunned by what hes just seen mouth wide open
skeeter waves his hand in front of snitchs face
hes never seen a naked girl before
were back to alex and robbie
looking at alex you were right
i was interested in page of this
well sometime bring your swimsuit
well come back on break
ill show you how to do it
surfs is this way
and keep an eye out for frank over there

robbie nods in agreement and they walk off
robbie and alex are walking past the surfs up wave pool
pointing the first aid station is over there
just ask the guard
i just want to say hello to this girl i know
robbie walks over to the first aid station
doug fitzgerald the guy we heard in line on the first day is there hes a guard

oh you must be the new guy at aokees
yeah howd you know

looking back and waving as he walks away got it

jaffa smiles and picks up a radio
into radio attention lost river guards
we have a report that some huge fat bald guy has abandoned his swimsuit and is slidin down lost river with nothin on but a smile

we see two female life guards both with a surprised look on their faces
one has just reached into the water and picks it up to display a huge pair of swim trunks
both girls make an eeeew face
on pa system now into mike attention please
john big bootay report to lost river splashdown
john big bootay to lost river splashdown
to robbie hes calling for security
alex wanders off a moment looking at something going on in the distance
page of to jaffa wow
i thought i was far from home
dropping the accent a bit ill let you in on a little secret
perception is everything
now jamal from aurora hes probably over with those guys
we see skeeter and snitch walking into the mens room looking suspiciously around
back to the accent cleaning the rest rooms
but jaffa from jamaica hes in customer service wearin the nice shirt and playing the music
perception and atmosphere
you get it
robbie smiles and nods and waves goodbye to catch up with snitch is filling up a water balloon while skeeter is tying a piece of fishing line to the hook
on the inside of the stall door
skeeter climbs up on top of the stall
snitch is tying off the water balloon and grabs the other end of the fishing line and ties it to the fill end of the balloon
he shuts the stall door tosses the balloon up to skeeter who places it strategically on the beam above the toilet
skeeter then jumps down and they head for the door
we see eddie cautiously checking out the restroom
he reaches up over the closed stall door and feels gingerly the fishing line
he smiles and shakes his head and heads for the door
eddie is now pushing his cart and making his way toward the mens restroom
he stops to talk to two concessions girls and show them a magic trick that apparently involves a deck of cards which he pulls from a place on his cart
we see him holding the cards so one girl can pick one
skeeter pops his head out and looks around
he sees eddie in the distance about minutes away and putting a plastic liner in a trash can
he nods and disappears into the mens room
skeeter and snitch appear at the door look out and see eddie finishing his card trick
he presents a card for the page of girls to see and the both nod encouragingly but as they walk off they look at each other and shrug
skeeter and snitch take off barely containing their laughter
but eddie notices them leaving
all of this has happened under the watchful though distant eye of alex
eddie goes into the restroom
eddie exits the restroom and goes to his cart
at this point alex and robbie walk up to him
what have you got
eddie reached onto his cart and pulls out a pair of scissors eyeing them
you got this
alex and robbie walk away as eddie places a restroom closed sandwich board in front of the door
just then big mike rushes up
big hurry potty emergency oh eddie
listen i know youre working but you hold on for just a minute
ive been so busy and i really gotta go
eddie motions and tries to find the words
but big mike is already in
eddies waits for it wincing and there is a loud splash
echoing through the door yeahhhah thats cold
eddie just shrugs and puts away his scissors
two young women guards katie and amy are loading kids into tubes and pushing them onto the slide
amy is a little older than katie
so then he just disappeared
i had to call my dad to come pick me up
page of katie just shakes her head in amazement
robbie and alex walk up to them
amy is out of earshot loading a kid
alex hangs back a bit
to katie hi
were looking for some table stretchers and left handed coffee pots
amy this guy is looking for a table stretcher
coming over aokees huh
surprised uh yes
to robbie seeing alex in the background theyre all down at big mikes last i saw
to alex when you gonna tell him
katie this is alex and
taken with katie robbie
ummm rob zirpollo
well anyway big mikes is where they are
alex and robbie walk off
what a couple of losers
i dont know
i thought robbie was kind of cute
listen youre new so let me tell you how things are
first those guys were wearing blue shorts
that means page of concessions
uses her fingers to explain the water world social structure is organized on three levels
at the bottom are the trash rats
they clean the toilets and empty the trash
most are only years old
its the only job younger kids can do here
next up is concessions
theyre our middle class
we dont hang with them and they dont much hang with us
at the top of heap are the guards
you are a guard
girl if you want to go out with someone stick with your own kind
looking off at robbie and alex walking away aw thats just silly
i think hes cute
this in an area where riders splash down from riding a tube down the river country slides
robbie and alex are walking past the splashdown area
what did that girl amy mean
when she said when are you going to tell him
ill tell you over a hamburger at big mikes
robbie and alex proceed to big mikes out of frame
suddenly in the background we see a tube splashdown from a slide and the year old girl riding in it falls out
realizing she is no longer safely in a tube she screams and begins splashing as if drowning
a guard nearby blows a single tweet of her whistle
in slow motion we see four other guards throughout the area turn and react to the whistle
they begin running baywatch style towards the scene
page of two guards are running and carrying a backboard
they converge in another baywatch style slow mo shot and line up along the edge of the splashdown pool
one guard in the middle has a rescue tube and still in slow motion squats down slowly as if to jump in and rescue the girl
at the low end of the jump crouch however he stops
we see his face in close up as he says
slow motion voice distorted to the girl staaaannnd uuuuuuuupppp
the drowning girl stops splashing wildly and realizes she can indeed stand up
she looks at all the guards lined up smiles sheepishly and walks out of the pool
alex is standing outside of big mikes
robbie is walking out of the restaurant
shaking his head aokees not going to be happy
nobody seems to know where these things are
now laughing what
theres no such thing as a table stretcher or a left handed coffee pot
what a dirty trick
smiling its just aokees way of giving you a tour of the park without having to be there
consider it a rookie initiation
still mad humph
time to make it up to you
page of alex knocks loudly on the door
a teenage boy dave in a big mikes uniform answers
how bout two for two
looks at robbie chocolate
robbie nods dave disappears for moment
now if he ever shows up at our back door we owe him chicken and smoothies
dont we get an employee discount
shouldnt we go in the front
the discount is larger this way
robbie is getting out money from his pocket counting through it
dave shows up with two burgers and two malts and hands them to alex disappears and shuts the door quickly
robbie is still staring at his money
lets go eat
they walk out of frame
alex and robbie are cleaning tables after another busy lunch
we see that aokee is filling up a bucket and getting a scrub brush and heads out the doorway
here we go
the pigeons have been taking target practice on his trophy pedestal
they exit out the same doorway as aokee
page of aokee is busily cleaning and cursing the pigeons
speaking hawaiian stupid pigeons
they should all die
to robbie happens every week
to aokee what is this thing for anyway
he keeps cleaning
to robbie that stand is to display the coveted surfer king trophy
aokee seems to think that one day some concessions kid with more courage than brains is going to beat the lifeguards in the annual employee olympics
and what would this concessions kid have to do
just out surf the strongest guard of them all in the surfing competition
no big deal
has it ever happened
a guard always wins the surf competition
robbie and alex because concessions kids cant swim
still cleaning someday
they go back into aokees surf and snack shack
robbie is now behind the counter making smoothies
he puts page of them up and the two kids waiting take them and walk away
in walk amy and katie
to robbie hi there
blinking smiling hello
two blue crushes please
he shakes a mix container blends it for about seconds and pours it out into two cups
he then puts in two umbrellas with pineapple
ive never gotten umbrellas before
these are only for vip guests
amy looks over to katie and rolls her eyes
alex arrives at this point and decides to provide a distraction
have you ever seen the fabulous cummings and robbins b
shaking her head i dont think so
as he leads her back into the kitchen
it washes plates an hour
to robbie so
youre not from around here huh
i just moved here at the beginning of the summer
ill bet californias nice
ive never been west of the mountains
page of youd love the ocean
and the sunsets are incredible
you can almost hear the sizzle as the sun drops into the ocean
daydreaming a bit of course we all know it doesnt drop into the ocean
pause im surprised youre not a guard coming from the ocean and all
lets just say i missed my chance and alex saved me from a death worse than fate
i was very nearly a trash rat
alex has distracted amy all he could and they return from the kitchen
that was exciting
maybe next time you can show me how to scrub the grill
come on katie
to robbie interested well
howd you do
i told her how beautiful the california sunsets are
you work fast
hey its time for our break
bring your swimsuit
i love that water
robbie looks confused
its only three inches deep
grabbing his suit and a towel ah ha
page of robbie and alex have their swimsuits on and are in line to get on the wave
alex is coaching robbie
now just take it easy and dont expect too much at first
when you wipe out your ride is done
alex is up now and he grabs the board and jumps in
he is pretty good but not nearly as good as the wave bums
he does a few tricks and wipes out
he gets up and walks up to the line to watch robbie
shouting just ease into it
robbie takes the board and looks around
he jumps full force onto the wave
it takes him just a moment to get the feel of the board and then he is all over it making the wave bums look like rookies
spins rolls everything that can be done he does
finally the guard blows a whistle indicating that his time is up
meeting him at the exit gees
where did you learn to do that
im from oceanside california
i was born on a surfboard
they start walking back
they stop for a moment to look at thunder bay
just then a wave spews out and kids on tubes are screaming as they always do
think you could ride that
looking right into alexs eyes in my sleep
alex just smiles
aokee is cleaning up behind the counter
alex is grinning like the cat that ate the canary
what you so happy about
page of shaking his head youre not gonna believe it
some guy came in today and try to buy a sandwich and pay with a phone card
today i believe anything
i took robbie to the wave today
looking around what
it turns out that hes from oceanside
you know where they always hold those surf competitions
it turns out that he placed second in the state high school finals for the shortboard competition
as a sophomore
laughing in disbelief dismissive then serious robbie barely walk without help
i saw it myself
you wouldnt believe it
we hear a loud crash from the kitchen
aokee winces and gestures toward the kitchen
i don believe it
thinking if this true
this could be da year
thats what i was thinking
well go get him
we need to make ready
he not just walk in and win this thing
you heard it
hes in the kitchen
page of alex goes into the back
aokee sits at a table
robbie comes out of the kitchen wearing a dishwasher apron
robbie sit down
alex make up a volcano
this boy in training
sitting down worried what did i spill now
we hear the whine of a blender as alex is working on the volcano smoothie
robbie alex tell me you are some kind of surfer
yeah surfing is usually how i spend my summers
you know about employee olympics
some kind of trophy
surfer king trophy
looking down concessions never win
alex arrives with the volcano smoothie
he turns a chair around and sits
they will gang up on him
seems kind of silly to me
its a big deal
every girl wants to date you
every guy wants to be you
we all wear standard uniforms
the surfer king gets to be creative
you ever see the cowboy hat cowboy wears
it shouldnt be that hard
how good could this cowboy be
he very good
his family go to hawaii every year two three weeks
if you do this you need to see pipeman
page of pipeman
hes a myth
pipeman very real
works here in park
you must find him and convince him to teach you the secrets of the thunder bay wave
this not the ocean surf boy
the banzai pipeline
i get it
some kind of legendary surf champ
where do we find him
i only see him once maybe twice
stay behind scenes
but here he is and find him you must
to robbie so
you do this
robbie looks at them thinking for a moment
we see quarters going ding ding ding into the pay phone on aokees wall
the shot widens to reveal aokee is dumping quarters and robbie is holding the phone
he puts it up to his ear
into phone hello grandma
no im fine
i need you to send me a few of my things
aokee and alex are huddled around smiling
big mike is standing walking around as he speaks tiffany is sitting
clearly she is being scolded
angry why you wouldnt believe the things ive heard
just stupid things
cutting in line
demanding special treatment
oh and how about this one mimicking her princesses dont carry trash
back to his voice ive often thought it was a mistake to have you work here
maybe i was right
page of trying to dance out of it oh daddy
you know how jealous people get
id almost believe that
but i was behind the first aid station when you said the princess line
this park exists because the kids here work hard
they need to be treated fairly
they need to see you are just another lifeguard
protesting but im not just another lifeguard
mad again you wont even be that if this continues
if you want to keep coming here every day and driving that little convertible of yours i need to see real concrete changes in your attitude
what do you expect me to do
for one thing start mingling with the commoners
youd be amazed at how nice some of the people who work here are
make some friends outside that little group of yours
its the work of the average teenager here that puts food on our table
show some gratitude
thinking a moment fine
ill work it
softening but firm good
work on it
nodding but we dont believe her oh daddy
dont worry about a thing
robbie and alex hook up and grab their time cards
there is a banner hanging that says employee luau tonight and skeeter and snitch have taken a gallon bucket and are using it as a stepladder to attach something
skeeter is on the bucket with a stapler in his hand
snitch hands up the hand lettered magic marker addition which page of skeeter staples on to the bottom of the banner while snitch keeps a lookout
the addition says come get leid
they scamper off laughing
looking up at the sign this will be good
aokee throws a great luau
i dont how much fun it will be
with aokee hosting well be working
therell still be time for fun
most of the work is setting up
besides we get paid too
when was the last time you got paid to party
with that alex punches in as if to punctuate the line
it is dark but the place is lit up by little lights everywhere christmas lights in the fake palm trees tiki lights around aokees and lights lighting a stage where
a band is playing what else surf music
buffet tables line the area and there is smoothie bar set up
big mike himself is behind the bar making smoothies while richard is playing bass in the band
aokee is running around making sure all the buffet items are full
everyone is wearing leis but the cheap plastic ones except aokee and his staff who have real ones flown in from hawaii
pouring out four smoothies to robbie and alex ok
you work hard and we fine now
your time to party
here they are
special love smoothies
to robbie these never fail
alex picks up two leis from a box behind the counter
he and robbie walk over to amy and katie who are standing over near the buffet
to robbie but if front of amy and katie now this will never do
agreeing im afraid youre right
something must page of be done
alex and robbie set the smoothies on a nearby table
they remove the cheap plastic leis the girls are wearing
then they put on the real ones they carried over
alex steps back to admire his work
oh yes yes
a work of art
the girls look at each other and smile
alex and robbie grab the smoothies and hand two to the girls
amy sips hers right away
i dont remember anything like this on aokees menu
interrupting special smoothies
fortunately you know people on the inside
onstage the band had finished a tune before the dialog began above
now jaffa steps up to the mike
wed like thank aokee and his crew for hosting this evenings luau
everyone applauds aokee waves
alex raises a hand and waves off the accolade
robbie nods and smiles as the amy and katie clap as well
wed also like to bring aokee up to sing one of his hawaiian specialties
again everyone claps and cheers him on
aokee goes on stage
you girls want to dance
grabbing robbies hand and leading out to the dance floor sure
amy shrugs yes and goes out with alex
onstage page of mahalo and aloha
this song is sung on my island for all young people in love
or about to be
is called e omai or you are mine
aokee begins singing the hawaiian love song e omai
many couples are dancing it is a slow song
alex of course is a goof
he dances slow but every once in a while executes a deep dip much to amys terror
eddie is off to the edge of the dance floor watching longingly and kind of swaying to the music
a couple of girls walk by and he does a magic trick for them
he holds both hands up palms open to show he has nothing in his hands
he also gestures that he has no sleeves he is wearing a tuxedo t shirt
he reaches behind his back and pulls out a trick bouquet of flowers but they dont quite open right and are still unfolding as he holds them
eddie smiles weakly he knows that isnt quite how it was supposed to go
the girls appear encouraging but as they leave look at each other and giggle
we pick up robbie and katie dancing
how are things working out at aokees
oh hes great
i thought this summer was going to be a train wreck but its not turning out too bad
well of course this isnt california
no but it looks like i will get a chance to do some surfing anyway
apparently theres some kind of surfing contest and aokee is all over me to enter
you mean the surfer king
youve heard of it
its all the other girls seem to talk about
this is my first year but page of apparently its a pretty big deal
being from oceanside you should have a good chance
it seems kind of stupid to me
a surfing contest in colorado
laughing my friends back home would never believe it
they continue to dance
we see big mike talking to tiffany and gesturing broadly
tiffany is clearly not agreeing with what he is saying
cowboy is nowhere to be seen
suddenly she throws up her hands and marches over to the dance floor where eddie is standing alone swaying a bit to the music
she whispers something in his ear and eddies eyes get real big as she leads him by the hand to the middle of the dance floor
she wraps her arms around eddie and they dance all the while glaring at her father
eddie knows a good thing when he sees it and quickly settles in big man on campus
tiffany is taller than he is so he happily puts his head on her shoulder
big mike looks back at them not happy with the way it happened but satisfied
doug fitzgerald twenty bucks doug is dancing with a girl when alex doing some kind of fancy spin to amy bumps into him
to alex alex
got my twenty bucks
you know i left my wallet over in my locker
ill see you before we leave and get it to you then
you know you could always come by aokees and i could give it to you in trade
cash money alex
alex grabs amy and swings her into another fancy move that leads them away from doug
page of the song ends and everybody claps
to katie hey listen
alex told me about this great spot on the other side of thunder bay that looks down on the party but its a little more quiet
want to go for a walk
they pick up their smoothies and walk off into the night
robbie is walking on the seawall that separates the bay from the sunning area tightrope style
katie walks next to him
what made your folks pick up from beautiful southern california and move to colorado
not both my folks
just my mom
trouble in paradise
lets just say my father had an eye for his administrative assistant and now theyre both somewhere in mexico
mom got a job here some of her familys here so they said colorady is the place you outta be
it could be worse
well i must admit ive met some very nice people
looking down and smiling in california the attitudes a little different
here not everyone is out to prove something
seems like everyone just wants to have fun
i have a theory
sometimes it snows here so hard that its a challenge just to get to work or to school
everything shuts down for a day or so
if your car gets stuck people appear from nowhere to help pull you out and get you back on the road
most people here dont just look out for themselves
a lot of times page of theyre looking out for you too
alex and amy are inside the kiosk
alex is showing her how everything works
all these switches feed sound throughout the park
which reminds me
he pulls out a cd and pops it into the cd player and presses play
he sees a flyswatter and begins waving it around like a sword
and this is for bad little girls who dont know how to have fun
he begins swishing it around amy is giggling
almost got you
amy is dodging and laughing
alex closes in and seems like he will kiss her but just starts gumming her neck tickling her
amy leans back laughing and we see her back hits the volume knob on the amplifier
they have reached the area to the west of thunder bay
it is simply a concrete pad that overlooks the party below
we hear paradise is in your eyes by michael peace which begins with a lot of jungle sound effects
looking down at the party you were right
this is nice
reacting to the jungle noises but not necessarily quieter
just a sec
he walks away slightly and gets on the radio
give us break down here
turn down the sound effects
alex and amy are kissing she is up on the counter of the interrupting but to amy uh oh
hold that thought
page of he grabs the radio
into the radio im on it
he turns down the volume back to normal
he also flips a switch
they hear the tune now and amy jumps off the counter stands there and smiles
alex does an over the top mambo moving to her and they start to slow dance
robbie has set down the radio and is walking back to katie now who is swaying to the music
he doesnt get too close to her and actually stands off to her left
since she has the room and is momentarily inspired she begins a few dance moves ballet and then ballroom style
robbie has seen this sort of thing before and instinctively almost without thinking steps in and becomes her dance partner
they proceed in a beautiful dance that almost seems rehearsed
finally it occurs to them both
quizzically so where did you learn to dance like this
smiling eight years at miss vickies studio of dance
what surprises me is you
somewhat embarrassed keeps dancing can you keep my deepest darkest secret
hesitantly when you grow up within spitting distance of hollywood every mother seems to think her child is the next harrison ford
so when i was about my mom started taking me to all these auditions for things
so are you the next harrison ford
some days im not even the next robbie zirpollo
they continue to dance
after a few moments
page of and
they stop and walk over to the railing overlooking the party
turns out i get this part
theyre selling some dish soap or something and they think it will be magical to have two twelve year old kids dancing ballroom on this fantasy set with clouds and
they lock this girl and i into a dance studio with a choreographer for two weeks and then they shoot the commercial
doesnt sound so terrible
you certainly learned how to dance
yeah but when it came out everyone in school saw it
i couldnt go anywhere for six months without everyone in the room laughing their heads off
touched drawing closer im not laughing
they kiss then return to dancing
we see alex and robbie discussing something forming a plan
they are going to look for pipeman
alex gestures in one direction and robbie takes off
alex goes in another
alex walks up to the guard appears to ask a question
the guard shakes his head no
alex walks off
robbie is talking to a cashier in the store
she shakes her head no
robbie walks out hurriedly
alex is talking to jaffa
jaffa gestures wildly as if telling some big mythical story but at the end throws up his hands as if to say i dont know
page of we are in pitch darkness
we hear the sound of heavy scraping metal
lights shine and we are looking up through a manhole cover being removed
robbie bends over the hole and hollers pipeman and peers in
he shakes his head negatively and moves on
we are at the back door to big mikes
alex knocks and the same kid as before dave pops his head out
alex appears to ask a question dave goes back in as alex waits
dave comes out again and gestures no one knows
alex starts to leave but turns back and asks something else
dave disappears and comes back with a burger
alex shrugs and walks away unwrapping and eating the burger
robbie sees a door marked employees only
he looks down at his employee id and shrugs and goes in
as he enters we see he is pushed out by some unknown force
out the open door comes wally the water world mascot who walks off
robbie has been knocked to the ground and looks up shaking his head
he gets up and walks off
now it is alex who has separately come upon the same door not knowing robbie has already been there
he enters and the door remains open
we hear girls screaming and he exits quickly followed by a volley of thrown girls underwear swimsuits and towels
this room is creepy
it is full of loud pumps and large pipes
robbie is making his way through a labyrinth of piping and gauges and the like
he peers and sees a head with a red scarf but it moves out of view
surf music fades
there is a constant whine of the pumps
robbie moves further in and finally comes across a man holding a large pipewrench with his back to him
he is working to tame a small leak
loudly this time hello
page of this startles and kind of angers pipeman
youre not supposed to be in here
are you pipeman
recovering from the startle not on purpose
i guess some people call me pipeman
spose its better than carl
so youre real names carl
i just said pipeman was a better name than carl
well my names robbie

to himself everybody wants to be the surfer king
to robbie what advanced surfing experience

i hate to disappoint you but this is the reason they call me pipeman
im the plumber around here
pipeman holds up the large wrench
page of oh boy
see im from california and i can surf i just dont know what to expect from the wave on thunder bay
i was just hoping you could help i really am sorry for bothering you
robbie begins walking out dejected
pipeman looks at him and feels sorry for him
wait a minute kid
i do know a little about surfing
i also know a lot about the wave here
what exactly are you looking for from me
perking up i need a mentor you know like in karate kid
he works at big mikes doesnt he

what religion are you
proudly im norman
ah brigham young and all that

we follow the big fat guy on cheers reruns
and your belief structure
usually involves a lot of beer and corn nuts but i dont think thats gonna work here
thinking tell you what
meet me at thunder bay tomorrow morning page of eight a
bring your board and well work something out
happily great perfect
i wont let you down
walking away muttering to himself what the heck is a corn nut
we see thunder bay looking east
aokee and alex are setting up lawn chairs
aokee is lathering on suntan lotion and puts on a large straw hat
alex puts sun block cream on his nose and they both sit on the lawn chairs
they both have large smoothies
robbie appears with his surfboard and lays it up against the east fence at thunder bay
pipeman arrives carrying a small device in a plastic ziplock bag
robbie approaches pipeman
glad you could make it
pointing to pipemans hand whats that
this is how i trigger the wave
a garage door clicker
what did you think
waves just happen
this is colorado kid
now get your board and get in the water
robbie gets his board and jumps into thunder bay paddling over to the narrow side where the wave begins
pipeman goes down the stairs leading to near where robbie has positioned himself
you sure thats where you want to be
should be about right
arent you getting in
wheres your board
mentors dont get wet
i looked it up
pressing the clicker get ready
a wave comes and robbie begins paddling
he misses it page of splashes the water angrily and turns back to paddle to position again
aokee and alex look at each other nervously
want to know what you did wrong
mad just gimme another wave
another wave comes
robbie paddles furiously and misses it again
now hes really angry
tell me what i did wrong
youre in the wrong position
the wave doesnt crest that soon
move ten feet further away from the back wall
to himself the ocean never had a back wall
to pipeman thank you
robbie paddles over to the spot suggested by pipeman
aokee and alex are now sitting on the edge of the lawn chairs anxiously awaiting the next wave
it comes and robbie catches it easily and begins riding it aggressively
he has a good run and kicks out at the end
aokee and alex high five
together yeee haww
they settle back into their chairs to absorb some sun
aokee is behind the counter finishing up making a smoothie
richard head lifeguard is on the other side he will get the smoothie
i hear hes pretty good
havent seen him myself yet
concerned covering good
good at what
who you mean
page of come on
your ringer from california
everyone says hes gonna give cowboy a run for his money
robbie barely walk without help
we hear a loud crash from the kitchen
aokee gestures back towards the kitchen
your surfer king
we just make a good show
your boy have nothing to worry about
you know id feel a lot better if you hadnt taken most of my money in that poker game last friday night
not an island game
i no good
tell you what
sight unseen even money twenty dollars on cowboy
you want to bet with me
take my twenty dollars just like that
not worth the trouble twenty dollars
now maybe a hundred
a hundred bucks
another crash from the kitchen this time pots pans
to kitchen robbie
ok a hundred bucks
they slap hands to seal the deal
richard leaves grinning and shaking his head
to kitchen page of robbie
come out here
entering from kitchen sorry dude that tray was way off balance
robbie our secret getting out
you practice too good
happy im really getting the hang of that wave
make good show
thinking ill try to remember to look and see whos watching
pours the rest of richards smoothie good
here have a smoothie
you too skinny to surf good
robbie smiles and takes the smoothie back to the kitchen
robbie and pipeman are in the middle of a practice session
pipeman is at the side robbie is in the water on his board
gesturing ok now this time get up on the board more quickly
this is a wave pool and this wave dissipates quickly
you only have a little time to show your stuff
how will the judging work
you get a possible ten points
three for your surfing three for your style and four for the judges overall impression of your ride
no ones ever gotten a ten
im not really sure why
youve seen the competition
what does everybody do
everybody just surfs man and tries not to fall
the big reason cowboys done so page of well is he goes to hawaii for a couple weeks every year
but there hes mostly a longboarder
your job is to figure out how to make the most outta this little wave
the wave comes and robbie catches it and surfs it hard kicking up high at the end
we see cowboy and tiffany standing overlooking thunder bay
cowboy has binoculars and is looking through them
hes pretty good ill give him that
concerned how good
if i have an off day he could win
really concerned thats terrible
youre the surfer king
well some days you get the wave and some days the wave gets you
this cant happen
what are we gonna do
i dont know what youre going to do but as me for me im gonna schedule some practice time of my own
this may take a lot more than extra practice
well i dont know what else you expect
ill go out and do my best
if thats not enough its not enough
tiffany grabs the binoculars and stares down at thunder bay
we see gears turning in her head
robbie and alex are walking by
jaffa sees them
page of hey surfer boy
i got fifty bucks at three to one
dont let me down mon
to jaffa hey jaffa
to alex shocked people are betting on me
just a little friendly pool
no big deal
helps make this more interesting
concessions never had a chance before
ive seen this cowboy practice
his style is more longboard and this is a shortboard wave but hes still pretty good
i could lose you know
two concessions girls are walking by them
together hi robbie
how ya doin to alex after they have gone by see
how come everyone knows me by sight now
ah youre the next big thing
youll survive it
the employee olympics are only a week away
what happens is we have this big opening ceremony where each team chooses a theme and were judged on our spirit
then different teams compete in contests that test their water world skills
the next morning it all ends with the surf contest
another group of concession girls calls robbie from one of the snack bars
ive been working out a strategy to use if cowboy has a real good day
just then they both nearly run headlong into tiffany
well hello robbie
surprised you know me
page of of course i know you
its my fathers park i try get to know everyone
interrupting eager im alex
yes im sure you are
ignoring alex back to robbie its been a while since ive been to aokees

the best teriyaki east of the pacific
and one those smoothies i hear so much about
stunned well sure

she walks off
robbie just stands there
alex starts walking then comes back
finally alex pushes him on the shoulder
come on we gotta get back
still shocked yes
yes we do
aokee is wiping the counter alone
he turns toward the kitchen
we need more large smoothie cups out here
aokee continues cleaning up
alex shows up with a load of cups aokee takes them and starts placing then
to alex look at that
we see in a far corner of aokees tiffany and robbie in an page of animated engaging conversation
second time this week
our boy big man on campus huh
i hope he knows how to work without a net
we all grow up sometime
he not drop a tray of dishes in days
something going right
you think he ready
i guess well both find out on sunday
i sure hope so
we see tiffany and robbie again and tiffany is laughing loudly at some joke robbie has made
robbie alex amy and katie are clocking out for the day
robbie clocks out first
tiffany drives up in her convertible
waving him over robbie
robbie goes over to talk to her
we see him go around to the passenger side
i wont need a ride tonight after all
tiffs taking me home
robbie jumps in and they drive away
alex amy and katie are still standing on the porch of the time shack shocked at what theyve seen
grossed out tiff
forlorn stunned tiff
we see robbie and tiffany drive out the gate
we see katie walk slowly out of the park alone
as she is walking we flash back to scenes of katie and page of robbie together dancing and laughing
this time the dance moves to the song of allison krauses new favorite
we take a final look at katie with the setting sun at her back and see she is crying
we see the rising sun behind aokees head as he raises a conch shell and blows it like a horn
he is dressed like a hawaiian prince
as the shot widens it reveals six males and two females dressed in hawaiian native garb
robbie and alex are among several drummers with bamboos sticks in their hands that provide percussion for the hawaiian war dance
aie noka moka kei kai ke alo
the drums begin and the male dancers carrying spears begin the hawaiian war dance
the drummers sing the hawaiian folk tune no ka moku kiakahi ke aloha
there are about concessions kids in regular uniform sitting cross legged behind them clapping the beat in unison
the male dancers circle each other in time to the beat gesturing a story the seems to involve some invading army
the war dance progresses until the invading warriors are defeated and the folk song ends
at the end the kids sitting behind raise their hand and shout
looking to the south side of the pool we see about grounds kids sitting in rows
in our foreground there are six large trash cans with toilet plungers arranged next to them each
to our left are a line of six grounds kids in army fatigues carrying brooms as if rifles
the lead kid shouts company
the drill team marches into full view
the grounds kids behind clap the march beat
the marchers stop in front of the line of trash cans
page of the brooms come off their shoulders and are held forward
they begin a routine practiced with brooms in a cadence clapped by the grounds kids behind them
what do you do if its wet and not yours
in cadence dont touch it
dont touch it
how do you deal with a full can of trash
sound off trash rats
their brooms are raised over their heads
they allow their brooms to fall to their right side and march to the trash cans
they pull out bright blue ski masks a la blue man group and pick up the toilet plungers
the lead marcher holds his plunger high and shouts
he counts a four beat rhythm and they begin a blue man stomp like drum routine with the trash cans
page of two grounds kids in regular grounds uniforms approach holding steel trash can lids by the handles with gloves
these become drums as well as two of the drummers switch from trash can to can lids using the stick side of the toilet plunger as the drumstick
a competition erupts from the left and right sides of the line as they each set a beat and then the other matches
finally a show of unity as both sides join back into the beat for an ending flourish
they pick up their brooms and turn their attention to the kids behind them
they begin to march in place and the seated grounds kids clap for the tempo
to the seated grounds kids what do you do when the tables a mess
together we wipe it
we wipe it
what do you do when a toilets stopped up
we plunge it
we plunge it
sound off trash rats
they clap and cheer and settle back down to sit
all is quiet now
we see concessions kids sitting grounds kids sitting and we look to the west side of the pool and see lifeguards sitting
everyone is looking around
suddenly two lifeguards dressed as roman soldiers appear with horns
they bellow a roman call to action and two roman drummers lead a column of other lifeguards
page of first we see female guards dressed in togas filing in
behind them are six gladiators with swords and shields marching
they are followed by one female lifeguard with a basket of rose petals
she is throwing them into the path of the next group to enter
next we see six more guards dressed as slaves carrying cowboy who is sitting up on a first aid backboard
he is wearing laurel leaves and a toga he is obviously cesar
on the backboard is also the surfer king trophy
they all approach the area in front of the seated guards and rearrange themselves so that cowboy has a good view of the gladiators
the drummers count a cadence that sets the pace for a simulated battle between the gladiators
the simulated battle rages until three of the gladiators are on their knees before the three victorious gladiators
the victorious gladiators hold their swords over the fallen ones and look to cowboy for a yea or nay
cowboy generously waves and makes a thumbs up signal and the swords are put away
the seated lifeguards all raise their fists and shout
the guards holding cowboy set him down in front of an elevated platform that has a microphone
cowboy picks up the surfer king trophy and walks to the platform
he sets the trophy on a table next to the microphone arranging it carefully
we see now there is a large banner hanging at the back of the wave pool that says water world welcomes employee cowboy moves to the microphone and raises his
arm in a regal manner and speaks
to all let the games
the seated crowd now stands and cheers loudly
we see a group of three people two male and one female adults we will later identify as judges
they nod approvingly and write something down on their clipboards
we see big mike near them smiling broadly
we see that the lounge chairs have been removed and the area is clear
there are scattered squashed up pieces of white paper lying about
page of we look to the south and see that there are three boy girl teams with one of their legs tied together like a three legged race
the rub here is one team member has the dustpan and the other team member has the broom
a judge triggers a starter pistol and they are off
the lifeguard team falls almost immediately and the grounds team takes a early lead over the concessions team who are trying to figure the dustpan broom operation out
the two grounds people work tightly together and quickly advance
the lifeguards have gotten back up and are hobbling up to their first piece of trash
concessions has figured out the dustpan but are still well behind the grounds kids
finally the grounds kids win with concessions up second and lifeguards trailing in third
the judges note the finish on their clipboards
we see three male participants standing in the shallow end of thunder bay one red suit lifeguard one blue suit concessions and one green suit grounds a judge on the
rise to the west of thunder bay blows an air horn to start the race
they all rush into the bay and begin swimming furiously
the guard takes the lead quickly followed not far behind by the grounds kid
the concessions kid is working hard and splashing a lot but not getting very far
as the guard reaches the back wall he does an underwater racing turn and swims back toward the point where they started
right behind him the smaller grounds kid does the same thing
as they are returning they pass the concessions kid who still is splashing a lot but not going fast
after they pass him he stops as he is tired out
momentarily he cant even tread water any more and a guard watching from the sidelines jumps in and pulls him out
the swimming guard has beaten the grounds kid the concessions kid never finishes
there are three lines set up with several participants
it is a relay race with the baton replaced by a tray full of drinks in paper cups water
the colors indicate again concessions guards and grounds
the race is already in full swing with concessions in the lead
the last group of relayers are now getting their trays and concessions is way ahead
page of everyone is cheering their team on
the final pass is made to sarah who works for aokees
she takes the tray and moves gracefully to the final stop
there is a small table on which the drinks must be placed
she is clearly going to win when she suddenly stops
all concessions kids are shocked and plead her to go on
she does a nifty and graceful around the back maneuver with the tray proceeds to the table and sets down the drinks tipping the tray sideways to show no water
has been spilled
the judges scribble furiously
three picnic tables are set up in front of aokees
we dolly past each one to see that they are cluttered indentically with what appears to be the leftovers from lunch for four
behind each table is a team of two guards concessions and grounds kids
a judge blows a whistle and we begin by looking at the lifeguard team
it is a boy and a girl and the girl is not too keen on this
they bring a trash can with them and begin gingerly clearing the table acting as if they are afraid to get their hands dirty
we dolly left to see the concessions team a little ahead of the guard team
we dolly further left to reveal a grounds kid in a full rain suit with a face shield
a tremendous force of water is clearing the table into the trash can which the rain suited grounds kid is holding at its end
we dolly further left to see eddie in full army fatigues with safety goggles on and wearing the biggest super soaker water gun in the history of man
the table is quickly cleared and at the same time washed
eddie holds up the business end of the super soaker gun and blows imaginary smoke from its barrel like an old western gunfighter
the judges take notes
the three different teams are gathered in groups waiting for the next challenge
one of each team is in full sweats color coordinated by team
alex is the one in the sweats for concessions
slowly the sweats people walk into the pool about waist deep and lay page of down
the grounds kid is the littlest guy of all
a judge blows a whistle and four members of each team run into the water and drag their now soaked sweat suited teammate out of the water
they lie them down on a clear area and begin cpr
the guards have a nifty little plastic device that lets them blow air into the mouth of their victim and they roll him quickly on his side to clear water
and back to begin cpr
they are fast and efficient and clearly expertly trained
we move left to see the grounds kids knowledgeable but inexperienced
one girl is using her hands to provide a seals over the mouth of her victim and another is clumsily pumping his chest while the others try to keep a
count while reading some kind of instruction card
we move again to see the concessions kids who are in trouble
alex is lying there dying and they are arguing about who has to breathe into his mouth
they form a circle over him pointing and arguing
finally they all just walk off and alex is still lying on the ground eyes rolled back and twitching convulsively in a hilarious death scene
the judges take their notes
once again three teams representing the three competing factions
large stainless steel pots are bubbling on three propane cooking stands in front of the concession
the teams each have three members in cooking aprons again color coded
one from each team is stirring the teams chili while the others watch the judges anxiously
lines are forming in front of each pot with people in line each carrying a paper chili bowl but holding back deferring to the judges
the judges are each carrying three styro cups in which to receive the chili
they each get a portion from the guard team and take a sip
they smile politely to the cooks but turn around and spit the chili back into the cup as delicately as possible almost as if throwing up
a concessions kid is there with a tray of waters which they quickly take advantage of
they move on to the grounds team
they get their portions and taste the chili and nod not bad
they take another sip of water to clear their palate and move on to the concessions team
the portions are proudly scooped
they take a taste smile and take some more
they huddle for page of a moment and then place a blue ribbon on the concessions pot
the lines quickly rearrange and merge themselves so that everyone is in line for the concessions pot
an obstacle course has been set up and the event provides a background to the dialogue that follows
aokee has some papers and is talking to alex and robbie
looking through the papers this isnt good
looking at alex and robbie its the same as every year
pretty much a dead heat going into the surf championship tomorrow morning
i cant believe those guys screwed up the hard to blame them
no one told them they had to put their mouth on yours until the last minute
bunch of babies
to robbie its going to be up to you
we slip a little
you have to make up
that trophy need a new home
they look over at the obstacle course where a tiny grounds kid is jumping up and down and raising his arms rocky style
you need to make up
tomorrow morning last event
you our last hope
robbie just looks at both of them nods and sighs heavily as the other grounds kids surround our winner in the background
aokee and alex walk off
suddenly tiffany appears
shy but still very much smitten oh

she starts to walk off
oh and robbie

hypnotised she walks away
robbie stands there a moment before waking up and leaving also
it is dark
we see alex and aokee cleaning up from the days food service
alex is wiping down the smoothie area aokee is sweeping on the other side of the counter
voice somewhat hushed im telling you we need to talk him

alex disappears back into the kitchen
aokee goes to an empty table under the one light on in the dining area and sits down
alex comes back and robbie follows
im done with the pots and pans
its almost nine

robbie please sit
robbie sits down
so does alex
robbie looks at both and gets suspicious

disbelief aw come on
page of robbie
shes still going out with cowboy
i saw them together at the movies two nights ago
maybe shes just letting him down easy
things are not always what they seem to be
in this case she acts like she likes you when really she wants cowboy to win
you guys are nuts
shes not like that
she is like that
look i know what to believe and what not to
im not that easily fooled
shaking his head go ahead
i trust him
take aokee for instance
gentle genial hawaiian guy right
i love working here
aokee youve been real good to me
then let me introduce you properly
robbie zirpollo meet manuel ramirez
aokees head is down in his hands
robbie looks stunned
manuels family snuck across the border ten years ago through juarez mexico
accent gone my father refused to work for a drug lord who ran our town
they tried to kill page of him
we barely got out with our lives
accent now mexican a name i picked up reading an obituary in the paper
i sent away to hawaii and got his birth records and social security number
this way i never have to worry about immigration
i spent weeks watching tapes of hawaii five o just to get the accent right
book em danno
whats that all about
to alex and you knew
alex nods yes
i burnt my hand on the grill one day and started swearing in spanish
interrupting and i said boy you speak spanish like a native
its been our little secret
now its your secret too
looking at his watch i need to think about all this
nodding you do
gets up dazed right
alex and aokee just sit looking at each other
hundreds of people are gathering on bleachers to watch the surfing competition
a large highway construction type signboard has been erected and says grounds concessions and lifeguards
it is almost a festival atmosphere
the judges are standing page of in a group conferring near a table that has the controls for the sign
the sign can be viewed easily from the bleachers
we look over to the front of aokees and see aokee and alex standing outside the restaurant
to alex have you seen him
they are looking to the north towards the crowd but robbie appears behind them
looking in the same direction what you lookin at
we looking for you
how you sleep
i slept fine
pause as aokee and alex wait i decided im not my father
i dont run out on the people i care about just because some blond shakes her ta tas at me
relieved we go then
robbie picks up his board and they begin walking toward the bleachers
alex stops and turns suddenly
she shook her ta tas
no one said anything about shaking ta tas
reflectively this puts a whole new light on things
he is in robbies way
robbie pushes him with his board
robbie cowboy and melinda from grounds who we met earlier and was conned into the contest because she said she surfed once on vacation are all standing in front of
one judge explains the rules
page of looking down at clipboard alright heres the deal
you get three tries three heats
we judge each run and only your high score counts
if you fall you get no score for the run
your score will be added to the total for your team and the winner gets the surfer king trophy
they all shake their head no
then lets begin
grounds is up first
melinda grabs her board and begins paddling out
the wave comes and its all she can do to stay on her board
she struggles and falls at the end
she will clearly not be a factor
the big screen shows a in a column after the grounds score
we look back to the bleachers to polite applause but the colonel and the grounds kids are clearly disappointed
cowboy is out there now the wave comes and he catches it easily
he rides the wave gracefully and well and kicks out at the end
the big screen shows an in the lifeguard row
the lifeguards and richard are cheering now
robbie is next
he catches the wave and rides it more aggressively than cowboy but nearly falls at the end of his run
the big screen shows an
the concessions kids and aokee are very enthusiastic
they can see they have a chance with robbie
pipeman is watching from a far corner
melinda begins her second run
she is a little more confident this time but still seems barely able to stand and ride the wave
more polite applause and the big screen shows a
cowboy catches his wave and tries to imitate robbies more aggressive style but falls midway through the run
we hear a large gasp from the crowd as this happens
the crowd applauds politely and the guards are supportive but disappointed
we see the judges confer and the big screen shows a
robbie gets his wave and surfs it aggressively again this time not nearly falling at all
the judges nod approvingly and confer
the big screen shows a
the crowd goes wild especially the concessions kids
melinda begins her final run
she does better than the past two but not significantly
the judges confer and the screen shows a
the ground kids are very disappointed they know they are out of it now
the colonel shakes melindas hand and thanks her for her efforts
page of cowboy gets his wave and has clearly decided to go back to his original style he rides the wave gracefully but takes no chances
he kicks out at the end with a wave and a smile
the guards applaud hoping to make it seem better than it was and the judges confer and the screen shows an
robbie snags his wave and rides it aggressively again but loses his balance momentarily
it costs him the judges confer and the screen shows a
the concessions kids applaud and the point totals show grounds concessions and lifeguards
everyone is confused there has never been a tie before
the judges are flipping through papers and big mike steps up to the microphone
clearing his throat flustered it looks like we have a tie
this has never happened before but i seem to remember we provided for this possibility in the rules
hopefully our judges can help us figure out what to do
the head judge is reading to the other judges out loud slaps his hand on one of the papers and comes up to the mike
reading from the rules
in the event of a tie at the end of three heats in the surf competition the teams who are tied will participate in a sudden death surf off
additional heats will be run until a winner can be declared
looking up at the crowd the sudden death heat will begin in five minutes
theyre going to see some more great surfing
the judges signal cowboy and robbie to come over
the head judge takes a quarter out of his pocket and points to cowboy to call it
it lands and the judge looks at it
he points to robbie
you want to go first or second
be ready in five minutes
page of robbie alex aokee and pipeman have gathered in front of aokees to strategize
so what you do
wait for him to go crazy and fall
dont want to win with him falling
you could always go out and do your very best take a lot of chances and maybe win this thing on merit
dismissive dont be silly
that only works in the movies
shakes his head actually thats exactly what im thinking
its the reason were in a tie
ive been too conservative
ive got to do everything i can or just forget about it
its all or nothing
pause we gotta pull the fin
pull da fin
you think you can hold it
explaining one time these tourists from japan on the beach at la jolla offered me a hundred bucks to do a full spin at the top of the wave and
then slide down and cut back and do a full back flip
i pulled it off
a friend of mine had a tricks board with just a single fin and foot pockets
we gotta pull the fin
what do we do about the foot pockets
you got duct tape
pipeman reaches into his tool belt and pulls out a roll
what kind of plumber would i be if i didnt have duct tape
water world page of platinum
where do you want them
they place the board on a table
robbie pulls off two small pieces of tape and places them on the board
here and here
pipeman gets his screw gun out of his tool belt and begins removing the two outer fins of the board
he then begins looping duct tap around the board to create two foot pockets
this provides a background to the dialog below
so help me understand
what you do now
pipeman is taking the extra fins off my board
i only need one to make a deep cut back
he is also putting some pockets to slip my feet into so when i flip upside down i dont lose the board
flip upside down
a back flip
you guys see it on snowboarders here all the time im sure
oh yeah im sure i did that last winter
but not on purpose
youre either gonna win this thing or youre gonna die
quickly eagerly it would be better if you won
yeah well a tie is like kissing your sister
mock anger you stay away from my sister
we hear an air horn blast
they are ready to start
to pipeman ill need the biggest wave you can give me
scott on star page of trek ill give er all shes got capn
he hands robbie the board
alex heads back to the bleachers area pipeman goes to the pumphouse in back of thunder bay
aokee hangs back with robbie and speaks to him alone
dropping his hawaiian accent robbie
when you do this do this mostly for robbie zirpollo
but do it just a little bit for manny ramirez eh
aokee smiles and pats him on the back
they head for the bay
cowboy is in the water paddling out to get his wave
it comes and he has apparently decided to stay with what has gotten him this far a conservative style that keeps him looking good without falling
his ride is similar to the last one but even more graceful and lyrical and he gets a
to robbie looks like hes waiting for you to make a mistake
you sure you know what youre doing
im just making this up as i go along
works for me
go get em
robbie appears on the seawall holding his board and looking out first at the bay then at the crowd
his mom connie waves and he smiles weakly
he sees katie and she looks hopeful
she hasnt given up on him completely
he smiles at her and gets into the water
he begins paddling
it seems to take forever for him to get out to the spot where he catches the wave but he finally arrives
he sits there for a moment collecting himself then raises his hand to signal he is ready
the concessions kids have started to chant robbie
the guards are anxious but even they cant help moving to the cadence of the chant
the wave comes and he catches it quickly and slips his feet into the duct tape pockets
he misses one pocket at first then gets it in
he rides it carefully and at the right moment slides up to page of the top and executes a full degree turn out of the water
on landing back on the downside of the wave he slides down it quickly and then turns around with a deep cut and heads straight into the wave
at the top he bounces and does a complete back flip in slow motion
we see the crowd also in slow motion
aokee is covering his eyes he cant watch
alexs face is contorted with disbelief
various faces in the crowd are in open mouthed disbelief
the judges are staring intently focussed so as not to miss anything
robbie lands the flip and rides the rest of the wave
he waves to the crowd and kicks off exhausted
the place goes nuts
no one here has ever seen anything like this before
aokee and alex run into the water and help him out
people are still cheering
cowboy knows hes in trouble
the judges confer only momentarily and the score appears and the word concessions starts flashing along with the word winner
cowboy nods in agreement
tiffany says something to him and he appears angry
we can only hear part of his response something like disbelief you did what
aokee and alex lead him up to the grandstand
cowboy also makes his way up there and we see him talking to big mike
big mike nods in agreement and cowboy goes to the mike as the crowd settles down
as last years surfer king its my privilege to present this years trophy to the most amazing surfer on the water today
cowboy shakes robbies hand and robbie speaks at the mike
holding trophy i just want to thank aokee alex and katie for all their support
we see katie clapping crying
aokee and alex are clapping and smiling
and i have just one thing to say to everyone in concessions
we did it
robbie holds the trophy high as everyone cheers
page of grounds kids are stacking chairs in preparation for final closing
tarps are being thrown over everything and tied down
awnings are being taken down
chairs and tables are being moved
we see jaffa packing up his cds into that cardboard box
he also snaps the winter covers for the sound equipment into place
a banner hangs over the time shack thanks for another great year
alex robbie katie and amy are clocking out for the final time this summer
they all stop and look around one final time
suddenly tiffany drives up in her convertible
another summer gone
how about it robbie
you gonna guard next year
they could use your help
they all walk closer to her car
i dont know
we have a pretty good time at aokees
you know thats what i hear
maybe i should work there next summer
alex robbie katie and amy all say these lines pretty much at the same time
you wouldnt like it
thats a bad idea
and youre such a good guard
youd be miserable
maybe youre right
see you around
eddie appears out of the time shack wearing his tuxedo t shirt
page of almost singing tiffany
he walks up to her drivers side
feeling charitable warmly hello eddie
eddie shows there is nothing in his hands then reaches into the car and from behind tiffanys ear pulls a plastic easter egg out
he hands it to her and she opens it
a beautiful butterfly flies out and away
she is momentarily entranced
you know thats one of the most beautiful things ive ever seen
pause thinking what the heck hop in eddie let me give you a ride home
eddie waves his hand for her to scoot over so he can drive
she is surprised but does almost reflexively
he gets in and he looks at alex robbie katie and amy grinning broadly as he pulls away
alex robbie katie and amy just watch in stunned silence as eddie and tiffany drive off
collecting himself well
just another summer at water world
the group begins walking toward the exit gate as we go wide and helicopter upward
they get smaller and smaller in the shot as we hear the conversation continue
you know katie i really am sorry i was such a jerk this summer
well be going to the same high school
youll have plenty of chances to make it up to me
lets see theres homecoming the christmas dance valentines day
and of course the prom
