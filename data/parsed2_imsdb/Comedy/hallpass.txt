written by peter farrelly bobby farrelly kevin barnett pete jones september very late
all is quiet
then a battered mini van blows by a row of hedges that have been pruned to read welcome to cape cod
a moment later a flashing cop car flies by in hot the windshield is gone and the wind blows back the hair of two beat up looking men
the driver fred searing ish has a look of determination and resolve on his chunky face despite the black eye and blood stained tissue dangling out of his nose
the nervous passenger is rick mills
pull over man
no way i can out run em
no you cant not in this thing
another police cruiser fishtails out of a side street and oh god now theres two of em
i dont care im not stopping til we get there
are you crazy
yeah im crazy
im crazy about my wife
rick and fred come skidding up to the emergency entrance followed by the two police cruisers
when they stop we see that somebody has spray painted horny old man on the side of the mini van
fred jumps out and sprints toward the entrance
several cops spring from their cars and give chase
before fred can reach the front doors he gets knocked violently to the ground
rick climbs out of the passenger seat with his hands raised
hear me out gentlemen i can explain every
as a burly officers head connects with ricks chest we
and fade to black
and then law order music cue as we super on tv screen a video shows several young people early s sunning themselves at the beach
a young looking rick hams it up for the camera
see the stud in the blue shorts
thats me the summer i got out of college
wow dad you used to have muscles
reverse angle reveals emma and gunnar sitting on either side of rick
i still have a few
rick shoots him a look
back on tv screen a pretty girl with a knockout body comes up and puts her arms around rick
whos that girl
no i mean the young one standing next to you
mommy used to have long hair
and she wore a bikini
yes she did
how come she doesnt wear a bikini anymore
is it because of her fat ass
who said mommys got a fat ass
well uh i dont appreciate that language gunnar
youve got the best mom in the whole world dont ever say anything bad about her
just then maggie comes grunting into the room carrying a one year old baby in one arm and a basket of laundry in the other
shes in her late s cute with short manageable mommy hair
shes wearing sweatpants an oversized t shirt and no make up
hey beautiful you better get a move on were supposed to be meeting fred and grace soon
i know i know im trying
well how long you gonna be
forty five minutes sooner if you help with the kids
maggie looks to him hopeful
forty five minutes is good
maggie shoots him a look and rick smiles
okay kids first one in the tub gets college paid for
emma and gunnar just stare at him
come on you bums lets go
as rick starts to tickle his kids they run out of the room rick and maggie walk along hand in hand
theyre dressed up and happy looking
i miss going out with you on saturday nights
she smiles at him
i know its just like the old days
rick pulls maggie close as they walk
maybe we should make a rule that we go out at least six nights a week without the kids
we should go out every week just you and me
a beautiful blonde walks past them and rick gives a quick glance back at her ass
i think itd be healthy
you gotta be kidding me
maggie pulls away
you just checked out that girls butt
yeah you did and its rude
you think she saw me
oh uh yeah
im sorry honey im just kind of spacey today
come on were late
reverse angle reveals fred searing and his wife grace waiting outside a restaurant
fred sports a full head of hair thats maybe a little too stiff
grace is short and appealing in a rachel ray kind of way
fred leans in to kiss maggie as rick kisses grace
grace let me ask you something does fred ever check out other women in front of you
no freds not a gawker
grace pats a pleased looking fred on the head
come on mags lets go say hi to dr
we follow the women as they leave their husbands and enter the restaurant under a banner that says boston psychiatric association person of the year
grace and maggie approach the check in table
there they are
another angle reveals dr
lucy gilbert a very attractive and sophisticated looking year old holding court in the corner
girls thank you so much for coming
lucy speaks with a french accent
are you kidding me
youre the only friend of ours who ever got an award you think were going to miss that
angle on rick and fred standing at the bar
do you mind telling me how your wife catches you checking out another girl
what is this amateur hour
the bartender delivers a couple beers and rick pays
the girl walked past and i glanced back at her for like half a second
theres your problem dumb ass its the wrong order
you dont wait for the girl to walk past and then glance back
you turn when shes still fifteen feet in front of you
then you wait for her to walk into your line of vision
fred notices an attractive woman walking toward them from the right
before the woman reaches them fred turns to his left and holds the look until the attractive womans ass enters his view and he watches her walk away
i cant help it if her butt walks where im already looking
it was your air space
they turn to see a beautiful woman with a healthy tan walking past carrying several drinks
this is missy frankenfield mid s
calling back to them dont forget to mingle
the guys watch missy walk away
missys looking pretty good for someone going through a divorce
yeah thats rough stuff i heard they might have to sell the house
you gonna hit em up for the listing
what am i a vulture
nah i dont go after the divorcee business unless they approach me first
yeah its kind of tacky huh
as the guys crane their necks to get a better view of missys ass we
reverse angle to reveal maggie grace and dr
lucy sipping lemondrops and watching rick and fred from across the room
look at those two meatheads checking out missy frankenfield
what do they think theyre invisible over there
i thought you said fred wasnt a gawker
he was standing right next to you
i cant let him know that i know that would take all the fun out of it
you should see him
hes got some stupid move where he looks back before the girl passes to make it seem like he couldnt help but notice her ass
maggie and dr
ricks car is parked in the driveway and he and maggie are getting out
how about i drive the babysitter home while you go upstairs and prepare the altar
he puts his arm around her as they walk toward the front door
i want to honey but ive got to get up early with the kids
ill get up with the kids
but i have to go out and buy a gift theyre going to a birthday party tomorrow
ill cjet the gift then ill take the kids to the park then to the party
you can dust stay in bed get your beauty sleep and bask in the sweet sweet pounding im about to give you
i love it when you sweet talk me
maggie smiles but as rick opens the front door they freeze in their pov the babysitter paige cute is standing there with their year old gunnar
what are you doing up
gunnar runs into his mothers arms and maggie shrugs apologetically to rick
this is just a minor obstacle
rick is at the wheel of his dodge caravan and paige sits in the passenger seat
she is on the busty side
how were the kids tonight
that gunnar is so cute all he wants to do is wrestle with me
rick smiles at this
mills would it be okay to turn down the air im a little chilly
look i got goose bumps
as she holds out her arm to show him the goose bumps we rack focus beyond her arm to the erect nipples that are piercing through her sheer top like
back on rick as his eyes go wide with terror and he looks away
oh uh sure im sorry
flustered he moves to the temperature control which in large illuminated digital type reads
he quickly punches the a c off then trains his eyes straight ahead and grips the steering wheel tight at ten and two
the mini van pulls up in front of a sorority house
paige hesitates before getting out
mills can i ask you something
i was wondering
could you buy me some beer
rick looks surprised
buy you some
how old are you
but im turning twenty one next week
thats a biggie
my aunt usually buys beer for me but shes out of town
uh i dont know paige
i could get in a lot of trouble for giving alcohol to a minor
oh come on im a junior in college
you drank when you were in college didnt you
besides its so arbitrary
how does it make sense that twentys old enough to fight in iraq or watch a porno movie but its too young to drink a beer
rick shifts in his seat
twentys old enough to uh
fight in iraq
no the other thing
oh god yeah half the girls in those things are my age
rick catches a hint of cleavage a flash of leg
look i promise no ones gonna find out
if you want you can join me down at the lake well listen to some tunes and have a couple beers
rick stares at her pictures it in his head
she looks hopeful open
im sorry paige i cant do that
it would be
ricks voice has taken on a firmer more adult tone
paige seems amused by it
what is that your grown up voice
that would be inappropriate paige
with an edge what are you thinking
im a married man and i have a family
you think theyd like it if they knew i was hanging out at the lake all alone drinking beer with a college girl
she seems taken aback
i never said alone
my sororitys having a party down there tonight
rick clears his throat tries to hide his embarrassment
all right better get inside
she opens the car door then glares back at him
what the hell were you thinking
scoot along now
as she slams the car door we
rick bounds up the stairs to find maggie gently closing gunnars bedroom door
he just fell asleep
rick playfully pinches maggies butt as he follows her into their bedroom where
they find emma sitting up in their bed smiling
can i sleep with you tonight
maggie clearly softening to the idea shrugs at rick
are you serious
look besides the other thing i dont like the fact that my daughter needs someone to sleep with every night thats not going to be good when she goes off
to college you know
maggie rolls her eyes
can someone read me a story
rick looks at maggie then at his daughter
okay one quick story
come on jump on my back
emma jumps on ricks back
you can get started without me ill be right back
rick piggybacks emma out of the room
emma is putting ricks hair into ponytails
okay honey this is the last pony and then night night
emma finishes putting on a rubberband then looks at him satisfied
you look pretty daddy
okay now give me a kiss hug and go to sleep
she lays back on her pillow
rick gives her a big kiss on both cheeks
i love you emma
i love you too daddy
rick still in ponytails tip toes out of emmas bedroom closes the door so tly then hustles down the hallway
rick scrambles into the room and stops in his tracks
his pov maggie lays in bed fast asleep
rick wants to wake her up but sees that she needs the sleep so he just pulls the covers over her shoulders
as rick walks around the bed and into the bathroom in the b
we hold on maggie until she opens her eyes
she listens to her husband brush his teeth with perhaps a tinge of guilt and when he shuts off the faucet she closes her eyes again and we
rick pushes gunnar and emma on the swings as a sweaty fred approaches carrying a tennis racket
we see several tennis courts in the b
howd you make out
lost both sets
sod you get the business
fred nods and wipes his brow
pretty sure i got the auto and home
he told me to call his accountant on monday about the life
fred looks around at all the pretty moms and nannies with their children
can you believe the talent here today
they notice something o
their pov we see a scandinavian au pair bent over exposing her thong underwear as she picks up a child from a wagon
cpr girls back too
rick nods toward a pig tailed paramedic early s teaching a cpr class
the two men look on solemnly
imagine if we were coming here back when we were single
oh baby the damage we would do
the kids jump off the swings and run for the jungle gym
rick trails them like a sherpa carrying a couple razor scooters and a basketball as fred tags along
they shlep past the tri delta sorority playing ultimate frisbee and so you get lucky last night
nah the kids were up when we got home
how bout you
well kinda lucky
grace conked right out so i snuck out to the car and rubbed one out
rick shoots fred a look
what are you knight rider
why didnt you just go in the bathroom like a normal guy
and get caught by grace
cant risk it
besides cars turn me on its where i lost my virginity
and theyre comfy i just put the seat back and turn on the tunes
the guys sit on a bench
thats one of the things they dont tell you when youre young that youll still be jerking off after you get married
i thought it was dust gonna be a teenage thing
yeah i didnt see that one coming
the two men sit in silence for a long beat as the frisbee girls play all around them
you know what i miss the most
you know when youre taking a girls panties off for the first time and youre wondering if shes going to stop you but then she gives you that little pelvic
arch thrust that tells you that the struggles over everythings going to be okay
thats a happy moment
another thing gone forever
rick looks at his watch
i should get going i have to drop the kids off at a birthday party
you want to grab a coffee after
fred and rick stand in line
do you have any interest in going down to the patriots training camp one of these days
are you kidding id love that
i always feel kind of pathetic waiting in line for tom bradys autograph
fred i was planning on bringing the kids
thats the perfect cover
rick shoots him a look then reacts to something o
his pov slo mo of a beautiful girl walking toward him
her straight brown hair shimmers
her blue eyes twinkle
her white uniformed blouse is unbuttoned enough to reveal a tasteful amount of cleavage
this is coffee girl granola fresh australian spacey
back on the guys staring in awe
did you see her face
her face is tremendous
chanting scared please dont have a nice ass please dont have a nice ass
but as she turns to pour a cup of coffee we see that her ass is spectacular
rick turns away annoyed
oh come on
thats ri iculous
shes from australia
been working here about a month
whyd you have to bring me here
okay cool it tiger here she comes
coffee girl steps up to the counter and smiles at fred
iced coffee with two splendas again
fred wants to say yes but just nods
how about your mate there
her smile comes with a squint which makes her eyes sparkle
another angle reveals a wannabe artist type male employee mid s clearly covetous of coffee girl sizing rick and fred up as he wipes down a counter
re ricks shirt hey old navy you like a muffin with that
what do you recommend
theyre all good
the wannabe artist type steps protectively up beside coffee girl
id go with the bran muffin you guys are probably having digestive issues at your age right
rick flinches at this then turns to coffee girl
ill have a blueberry muffin please
make it a bran muffin for me
rick shoots fred a look clearly annoyed
as coffee girl turns to get their order we go to
rick and fred now with coffees sit at the rear of the shop
did you notice shes from cleavage ohio
i bet her areolas look like a couple of pepperoni slices
fred trains his eyes back on coffee girl and squints what the hell are you doing
im taking a mental photograph for my spank bank
jesus christ guys give it a rest
rick and fred turn to see ed long tall good looking mid s standing at the creamer counter behind them
oh hey ed
didnt see you there
thats because you were shooting laser beams at the java babe
well no we were just come on gentlemen youre married men and shes half your age grow the guys cant muster a response
so i guess ill be seeing you at the house warming party this weekend
this saturday afternoon at the new casa were inally in and were having a little celebration
oh i dont know if we can your wives already rsvpd
ed holds out his fist to them
come on pound the potato
rick and fred reluctantly take turns tapping eds fist with theirs
then ed leaves
what a d bag
hes right though
fred looks at rick
what are we doing sitting here gawking at her for
were married men its creepy
i dont see what the big deal is were not hurting anyone
what is he big brother hes gonna tell me what i can look at now
for god sakes dont take that away from me its all i got
as rick thinks about this we
close on a baby monitor pull back to reveal that its in the middle of a poker table next to a pile of one dollar bills
sitting around the table playing liars poker are rick fred gary hog head baker and flats all in their mid s to mid s
hog head has a huge melon baker is husky flats is a pale red head and gary is slight and squirrelly
rick you open
rick takes a fresh dollar bill off the pile in front of him and studies the serial numbers
hey wheres coakley
how come he didnt show
hawaiian tropic finals
the guys nod their approval
man imagine being coakley
the guys single hes loaded chicks love him he doesnt have to answer to anybody
thats the life
that is the life
let me ask you something what would you guys pay to have your way with a hawaiian tropic girl for an entire weekend
the guys perk up as they think about this
you get to pick any one you want and you know up front that you wont get her pregnant no diseases youre never gonna hear from her again and your
wife will never find out
hows it possible to know that my wife wont find out
im saying if it were possible like if i was a magic genie and i could grant you this wish but then make it like it never even happened
but would i still have memory of it
i think id pay bucks for that
baker shoots him a look
you cheap bastard
were talking about an investment that gets your rocks off and protects your wifes feelings
id pay five grand
well excuse me mr
wall street but us public school teachers arent getting any of that bail out money youre over tipping everyone with
just then the front door opens and maggie enters
oh hey honey
how was the book club
what did you guys read this month
old man and the sea
no muriels yoga book
the guys laugh
actually we were supposed to be discussing the sun also rises but grace pulled out a bottle of tequila and that was the end of that
so did the kids go down easy
gunnar and emma stalled for a while but they werent bad
how about the baby
rick points to the baby monitor in the middle of the table
not a peep
now win some money honey
she kisses rick and walks out of the room
i wish i could drink tequila
its a great buzz but it always gives me the spins and then i have to go home early
you want to know a sure cure for the spins
fred puts a hand over his right eye
just cover up one eye
it balances out the equilibrium
or you could find a nice step program
as maggie gets to the top of the stairs she can hear the o
sound of the baby crying
she walks down the hall opens the babys door and reacts
her pov the exhausted and sweaty baby is standing in his crib sobbing
the baby monitor is on the dresser next to the crib blaring out laughter from the poker game
oh you poor thing
she hurries to the baby and picks him up
he got the monitors mixed up
have you been listening to those loud mouths all night
as maggie moves to turn off the monitor we hear so how bout you fred how much would you pay to s end an entire weekend with one of the
hottest women in the world
maggie hesitates and listens in
i wouldnt have to pay im married to her
theres a beat then the guys explode in laughter
no seriously id pay five grand easy
maggies jaw drops
id have to figure out a way to get it out of the bank without grace noticing but i suppose the genie could help me with that
you could put me down for seven five
hog head your ass doesnt have seven five
more laughter from the guys as rick deals out fresh bills
so whats your number rick
oh jeez flats i dont know
any girl you choose
you get to do anything you want with her and your wife will never find out
its completely harmless a one time thing what would you pay for that
back on maggie as she cradles her baby and leans closer to the monitor
i honestly dont know fellas
push in on maggie as she waits nervously for her husbands answer
ive got a great wife and i sure wouldnt want to hurt her feelings so
maggie smiles at this
thats my guy
i guess the real question is what wouldnt i pay
the guys laugh o
and maggie reacts as we
maggies got rick backed into a corner
what wouldnt you pay
i didnt really mean it honey
scared defenseless they kind of put me on the spot
look some of the other guys were throwing out some pretty hefty bids
what does that have to do with anything
im the host of the party i didnt want to be a buzz kill
maggie squints appalled
look all i was saying was theres no amount of money i wouldnt pay to protect you and the kids
how is having sex with a hooker protecting me and the kids
no one said anything about hookers
you were paying for sex what would you call her
the genie was getting the dough not her
come on be reasonable it was just guy talk its not like it could really happen
maggie shakes her head disgusted and leaves the room
maggie grace and dr
lucy eat at an upscale restaurant
lucy listens quietly to the women
fred said five grand
what a blowhard
you know whats even funnier
hog head mccormick said hed pay seven grand
that bum hasnt worked since the dot com bust his wife supports him
the girls laugh
well look on the bright side at least theyre not cheating on us
sometimes i wonder if it would be better if they did cheat and get it over with
you mean rather than take the slow boat to resentment
the girls look to dr
im just saying
maybe a little freedom would be good for them
and for you
have you ever considered giving them a hall pass
a hall pass
a week off from marriage
grace and maggie stop chewing
wait a minute
are you saying let them go out and cheat
im saying give them a week off from marriage
look most married men have foggy memories of their single days and they somehow get under the impression that if not for you theyd be able to be with ail
those women who entice them
he thinks because he sees big tits everywhere and then still comes home for dinner that i should be welcoming him at the door like some conquering hero
well maybe its time to let them go out there and find out what its really like
youre talking about the nuclear option
maggie ponders the idea
and remind me again what good could possibly come from this
theres a wonderful principle in psychology called reactance theory
it basically states that if youre constantly told you cant do something you want to do it more than ever
and conversely if you remove the taboo you remove the obsession
grace makes a t sound
i got an idea doc why dont you try a hall pass out on your husband and let us know how it works out
oh i have
grace and maggie react to this
youre telling us you let charlie sleep with another woman
lucy takes a moment before answering
i am not telling you that
i am telling you that i gave him the freedom to choose for himself
all i know is
our marriage is better than ever
grace and maggie think about this
i dont know
theres a reason that men evolved and apes didnt
its because women demanded more
without a wife einstein wouldve been humping a maple tree all day
as the women laugh we there are several flashy cars out front of this huge mcmansion
as fred and grace and rick and maggie get out of freds mini van ed long comes out of the house to greet them
eds year old son is beside him wearing khakis and a polo shirt just like his father
there he is
the lord of the manor
come on everyone in the shack
the grand tours about to begin
ed and his wife kimmy late s high maintenance lead rick fred maggie grace and several other guests into a large wood paneled study
the longs year old daughter sticks to her mothers side wearing a matching dress
i call it headquarters
larry bohac mid s and his blonde bombshell of a wife mandy who wears a too tight t shirt look around in awe
thats sweet of you to say mandy
its epic ed
ed points to one wall which houses a glassed in humidor
and this over here this is the war room
the temperature in there never goes above fifty four degrees never below fifty three
i even threw in a back up generator in case we lose power and the main generator doesnt kick in
now who wants a cubano
theyre the real deal coakley snagged them on his trip to havana
wait a second ed first i want to show them lny headquarters
fred looks at rick and rolls his eyes
it looks like a waterworks showroom
despite its bloated opulence grace and maggie cant help but be impressed
its my paradise
with a price tag north of one hundred and forty large it better be paradise
ed holds out his fist and rick obediently pounds it
just then grace notices that fred has disappeared
hey where did fred go
rick turns and sees that hes missing
rick walks down a hall and finds fred in a guest room watching a baseball game on tv
what are you doing
i cant take these look at how much i own parties
rick nods and sits down beside him
when i bought my completely loaded honda odyssey i didnt go around bragging about it did i
well kind of
you made me drive around town with you for two hours remember
i thought youd want to watch a movie in a mini van
you never got to watch a movie in a mini van before did you
whyd you have to hook your boat up to it
because its the touring edition numb skull
the thing can tow more weight than ninety percent of the pick ups out there
everybody is admiring the antique fireplace
the mantle actually came all the way from tuscany which is in europe
hey gang check this out
oh god eddie they dont need to see that theyll think were wackos
ed punches a code into a keypad and the wall slides open revealing a safe room
maggie grace and the others follow ed into a safe room filled with video monitors surveilling all the rooms in the house
when kimmy enters she pushes a button closing the oh my god
this is like secret agent stuff
i think having a safe room is a bit over the top but ed feels with our two little ones you can never be too cautious
aw youre such a good daddy
aside to grace rick cant even set up the baby monitors right
ed points to a monitor where we see rick and fred enter the master bedroom
here come tweedle dee and tweedle dum
close on video monitor we see rick and fred cross over to the master bathroom doorway and look in
all im saying is who gets a mini van when you dont even have any kids
you dont know much about the insurance game do you rick
when you pull into a persons driveway to sell them life insurance who do you think theyd rather see
a hot shot in a porsche or a family man in a mini van
rick looks around the empty room
hey whered everyone go
guys were in here
they cant hear you
the rooms completely soundproof
on video monitor wall we see rick and fred leave one screen and enter another
rick and fred walk back into eds study
they mustve gone downstairs
fred motions to eds humidor room
thanks for coming to the war room old chap
by the way did i mention that my wifes vagina never goes above fifty four degrees nor below fifty three
larry bohac chuckles and grace shifts uncomfortably
uh maybe we should turn this off
but ed turns the volume up
close on monitor rick plays along with a bad british is that so dear boy
and what happens if you lose power during a big blow and your main generator doesnt kick in
well thats why i had the back up generator installed in kimmys rumpus
kimmy makes a face shocked
under breath resigned here we go
hey speaking of installations is that a shiny new set of cans on mandy bohac
either that or shes wearing her daughters t shirt
close on mandys surprised face
she looks at larry whos suddenly not so amused
they look good but ill still take the real deal any day
youre telling me youd take kimmy longs flapjacks over mandys new speedbags
thats what im telling you
i like boobs with a little mileage on em
theyre more fun
you can smoosh em swing em hump em stretch armstrong em
and what about the proven correlation between floppy boobs and large mouth vaginas
maggie and grace hurry down the front walk trailed by their shell shocked husbands
a trembling and irate kimmy is held back at the door by ed and a couple other guests
you people are horrible
im very disappointed gentlemen
no one speaks
grace drives and maggie sits beside her humiliation etched across their faces
finally uh anyone thinking chocolate chip cookie dough in a waffle cone
grace yanks the mini van to the side of the road and glares large mouth vaginas
as the guys cower we rick looks small and weak sitting on the couch while maggie stands across from him rubbing her temples
it looks like the norman rockwell painting where the mom reprimands her little boy for sneaking a frog into the house
you know what really troubles me
the thing that youre all so obsessed with is meaningless to you
its really just about numbers with you guys
rick looks up confused
rick you cant even tel me the month you lost your virginity
i can tell you the exact day and hour that i lost mine
rick seems a little embarrassed by this
well virginity is different for guys
the point is obviously i like sex too it means something to me but i dont walk around gawking at every guy i see
all right so i occasionally notice other women
rick rakes his hands through his hair and decides to come clean
okay you want the truth
you really want me to pull back the curtain here
from the moment i leave the house in the morning til the moment i get home i pretty much notice every woman in my path
maggie turns to face him
but its not how you think it is mags
its like a curse
i dont want to notice but i cant help it
its always been like that
i figured that when i c jot married that would be it but it wasnt the thing doesnt give two shits about marriage
so what are you saying youre not happy with our sex life
rick reaches up and takes her hand
of course im happy honey our sex life is great not that i wouldnt mind a little more but look one thing has nothing to do with the other
i think about sex a lot all guys do thats just the way it is
maggie sits down beside him clearly at the end of her rope
no one speaks for a few moments
then im giving you a hall pass
one week off from marriage
you mean like a trial separation
you are seriously overreacting
its not a separation its a hall pass
you can do whatever you want
get it out of your system
wait a minute are you for real
its not a yes or no offer and its not a debate
youre getting a hall pass
as maggie heads upstairs we push in on a confused rick
maggie is washing out a pan at the sink when rick enters dressed for work
we hear the o
sounds of the wiggles coming from a tv in another room
not facing him theres a couple hard boiled eggs in a bowl there for you
im gonna have to take them to go hon ive got a showing in fifteen minutes
rick puts the eggs in his pocket then approaches maggie and kisses her on the cheek
hey about this hall pass business
dont want it and i dont need it
all i need is i told you this isnt negotiable
she turns and faces him
youre really serious about this
rick this isnt something that i
look i really think you need this
i think we need this
rick doesnt know what to say
this afternoon im taking the kids out to my parents beach house
rick reacts to this
for how long
well be back in one week
and as far as im concerned starting right now
you have the week off from marriage
this is a big shiny place
all fixed up
fred pulls up in his mini van and gets out
he walks past a coldwell banker for sale sign with ricks name on it
rick is showing the kitchen to a couple mid s when fred hey what are you doing here
i called your office and they told me you were in the neighborhood
rick turns to the couple
oh this is a friend of mine fred searing
fred this is harold and nancy goldberg theyre moving up here from long island
well mazel tov folks
the goldbergs look at fred a little warily as he takes out a card
here let me give you my card
home auto or life insurance im the go to mensch in town

rick quickly jumps in
to the goldbergs uh why dont you two take another look around and if you have any questions ill be right here
the goldbergs walk out and rick closes the door behind them
what the he are you doing im trying to make a sale here
you werent picking up your cell i wanted to see how much trouble you got in last night
you know what grace made me do
she made me call the longs and apologize
how bout you did maggie freak out when you got home
rick peeks out the kitchen door to make sure the goldbergs arent listening
then she gave me a hall pass
a week off from marriage to do whatever i want
shes going to her parents house down the cape til next sunday
youre full of shit
fred its true
you think i could make something like this up
fred stares at him
i dont get it why arent you more excited
i dont know how i feel
the hall pass
something about it isnt right
you mean like you think maggie might have a brain tumor or something
i mean just because my wife tells me its okay to cheat
why cant you just accept the fact that your wife is a goddamn saint rick
dont you see
she gets it
yeah but theres a part of me thats saying wow you must have pushed her pretty hard to get her to this point
and is that good for a marriage
that your wife is willing to try something this insane
fred cant believe his ears
come on doesnt it bother you that our wives dreams all come true but ours dont
look at maggie when she was a kid she played house you g a ve her a house
she played with her e z bake oven you bought her a viking
she played mommy you made her a mommy
the ovens a ge
its a real gas oven
and what about you huh
come on man your wife is living her dreams
and now its time for you to live yours
as rick thinks about this we fred and grace climb the stairs at the end of the day
i dont know i think this is some very forward thinking on maggies part
quit lobbying youre not getting a hall pass
and you mark my words this is going to end up biting maggie in the ass
at the top of the stairs fred puts his arms around her
why would i need a hall pass
ive got you
not tonight you dont
im too bloated and i have cramps
i dont mind
fred do i have to spell it out for you
im having my period
yeah i got that
he moves in for a kiss but she pulls away
come on hon give me a break
disappointed fred watches her walk toward the bedroom
oh shit i forgot to take the trash out
freds mini van is parked on the street in front of his home
we hear styxs the best of times coming from inside the car and we move in closer until were
looking through the passenger window at fred
hes sitting in the drivers seat his eyes are closed and his head is slung back as he jerks off just below frame to the music
a police cruiser passes in the b
then a moment later backs into frame and stops next to fred
as the two police officers look on from their car trying to figure out what the guy is doing the oblivious fred continues to stroke his meat to the beat
officer gets out of the drivers side
he disappears from frame and then reappears at freds drivers side window
now only inches from fred he bends over and looks inside the the officer motions for his partner to join him
as fred continues to pound himself to the music officer climbs out of the cruiser
he takes out his flashlight and shines it on freds o
as the weary officers look at each other with a now weve seen it all expression we
the police lights are flashing now and several neighbors have gathered on their front lawns to see whats going on
pan to freds front steps where we see a handcuffed fred standing meekly as the two police officers confer with a furious looking grace in her bathrobe
all right maam if you say hes yours
you can have him
the officer takes off freds handcuffs
thank you officers
fred scurries into the house ahead of grace
as soon as the door shuts we hear as the police officers head back to their car we go
close on a smiling fred
i got a hall pass
rick is at his desk staring at a giddy fred
doesnt matter how
i got one
can you believe it
i got a hall pass
rick stands up elated
and ive got a hall pass
we both have hall passes
when does yours start
fred looks at his watch
twenty three minutes ago
she just left for the cape shes staying with maggie
its just you and me for the next six days
oh my god do you realize how much easier this is going to make it having a hall pass partner
and its not just me baker gary and hog head are coming out with us tonight
they got hall passes too
no no no they just want to watch
rick grows concerned
you think thats a good idea letting them in on it
what if they blab and it gets around town it might embarrass our wives
dont worry i already talked to them
their lips are sealed
rick and fred smile
were living the dream baby
law order music cue as we super rick fred and their middle aged posse baker hog head gary walk across a boulevard like rock stars
think of the slo mo shots from swingers or reservoir dogs
nobody smiles theyre all business as they hit the sidewalk and march straight into
they step up to the bar
five mgds my friend
while waiting for the beers the guys check out the scene
its mostly families a few young couples
the guy at the holiday inn express told me this place really kicks in around nine thirty
hey why are you staying at a hotel if your wives are out of town
well we cant very well take babes back to our places if they know where we live they might end up stalking us
besides i wouldnt be able to concentrate with all the pictures everywhere and the kids cut outs all over the fridge
yeah isnt it weird how your own kids can creep you out sometimes
rick shoots gary a look
i get the feeling theres a lot of divorcees in this place
divorcees are into kinky sex thats why theyre divorced
just then the bartender arrives with the miller genuine drafts and the guys clink bottles
so come on point out which girls you guys are gonna do tonight
gary elbows fred as he spots two middle aged women at the end of the bar
what about those two
why dont you bang them
theyre doing the theyre obviously hiding something back there
okay how about the blonde hostess
maybe somebody should nail her huh
attempt to be cool gary weve got a whole week
baker looks around at the lame bar scene
are you guys sure that applebees is the best place to be picking up women
what are you thinking olive garden
nah thats only good on thursday nights
hey what about the auto show
baker shoots them a look
are you guys for real
wait a second wheres coakley
thats where we should be
hes in iceland
whats he doing there
what do you think hes doing there
the guys all nod at this proud of him
look before we go bagging any chicks i gotta get a hunk of beef in me
hey i got a guy over at outback steak house who could set us up
ooooh hes got pull over at outback
hey i like outback
lets chug these and hit the road
as the guys drink up hog head puts his arm around gary
hey gar you dont happen to have any connections at do ya
maybe someone could hook me up with a players card so i can cut right to the front of the raspberry slurpy line
the guys all laugh as we this is an old summer shack nestled on a quiet bluff overlooking the sound
grace stands at the window staring out on the ocean while maggie nestles on the couch reading a summer novel
the kids are asleep and the place is quiet
i think we mightve made a huge mistake
stop thinking about it grace
why don t you just try to get some sleep
grace turns to maggie
i cant sleep
i dont understand you how can you just sit there and read knowing that rick could be making out with a supermodel right now
maggie doesnt answer
our husbands arent married this week
do you know what husbands do when theyre not married
youre going to wake the kids
are you going to sit there and tell me youre not the least bit concerned about what theyre doing right now
im a little concerned
grace flops into the chair across from her
of course im concerned
but what choice did we have
we couldve kept the status quo
i mean were things really that bad that we had to try something this extreme
for me they were
look you may call this a hall pass but for me its more of a hail mary pass
im serious i dont know what else to do
grace looks at maggie surprised
remember last week when we went to lucys award thing
that night when we got home rick and i were gonna
and i was waiting for him in bed while he tucked the kids in and i started wondering who he would be thinking about during sex
would it be the girl he checked out on the way into the party
or would it be missy frankenfield because i noticed him gawking at her
or how about one of the waitresses or maybe somebody he saw at work that day
then when he came into the room i did something id never done before i pretended to be asleep
youre kidding me
youve never done that
i do that all the time
maggie almost smiles
look i understand that people have fantasies and that youre not always thinking about the person youre with
thats for sure
but its just
i dont know
its been too long since i felt that he was thinking about me
they sit there for a moment quiet
then i need this hall pass to work grace because if it doesnt i dont know whats going to happen
we see two very old couples walking out with doggie bags
our five guys are in a meat coma slouched in their chairs nursing red wines and talking through purple teeth
several carved up potato au gratin and creamed spinach plates and mangled key lime pies litter the table
so where to now
rick cant think in this state
whats the question
what are we doing for the rest of the night
i dont know
getting laid right
i gotta go home and poo
yeah i put too much hollandaise on the mozzarella sticks
why dont you just back one out here
im pretty sure im gonna need a bath afterwards
baker musters some initiative and stands up
come on you guys
i say we go to a strip club and smoke cigars that wake us up
i got a better idea
lets go night night
i say we tie a bow on it and put her to bed
this is gonna be a long week so we should pace ourselves
baker looks at his watch
its only nine thirty
im with rico
freddy tie tie
are you guys serious
relax guys this is just the calm before the storm
get out the plywood and batten down the hatches
tonight we build up strength tomorrow we make landfall
law order music cue as we super rick fred hog head and gary are stretching on the first tee of a local four star golf resort while taking in the
nearby we see the hotel swimming pool lined with attractive women in bikinis
this place sure beats the hell out of the holiday inn express
why arent you staying here
besides since were paying for golf we get full access to the resort including the pool bar
mothers lock up your daughters the dogs are off the leash
turn and burn baby
gary raises his hand for a high five but rick balks
i dont do that
hey i say screw the golf lets go straight to the pool bar and start getting you guys laid
hoch head relax the pool bar aint going nowhere
besides itll be good for us to get a little sun before making our grand entrance chicks love a healthy glow
plus it wouldnt hurt to work up a little sweat get those pheromones flying
just then two sexy beer cart girls wave as they pass
you talked me into it
hey guys look what i brought
gary holds up a ziplock bag full of something chocolatey
the guys all look at one another baffled
what are we on spring break
where the helld you get those
i got an in
guy who washes my dog
he holds out the bag and the guys hesitate
eating it isnt like smoking it
its a much mellower buzz youll just feel relaxed
are they chocolatey
as hog head sniffs the brownies rick takes a practice swing
hog head come on who eats pot brownies at eleven in the morning when theyre playing golf
and by the way rick this is spring break
youve got a hall pass
live it up man
itll probably help your rap with the ladies later
garys right when are we ever gonna get the chance to do pot brownies again
hog head takes a brownie and bites into it
these are yummy
you dont even have a hall pass
i can still live vicariously through you guys cant i
its not vicarious if youre actually doing it
just hit your ball
hog head takes another bite
oh what the hell its not like my game can get any worse
rick watches fred pick up a brownie and tentatively taste it
then gary inhales his in one bite
all right give me one of those things
as rick drops his club and walks toward the brownies we a dazed and confused rick and fred are reclining in their cart in the middle of the fairway
for a while neither of them speak
then what kind of soap do you use
you mean in the shower
yeah i like dove it doesnt dry your skin so much
fred stares into space
sometimes its hard to wash off though
because of the moisturizer
you ever notice
i think hog heads dead
fred looks over and sees hog head sprawled out on his back in a sand trap
hes not moving
are you okay
as hog head starts to make snow angels in the sand an elderly course ranger pulls up in a golf cart
what the hell is he doing
rick and fred grow visibly tense at the sight of an authority figure
uh hes having back spasms
rick and fred turn and see gary standing chest deep in the middle of a pond just staring at them
what are you doing
i dont know you tell me
gary starts to laugh maniacally
the ranger turns to rick annoyed
look this is the third time ive had to flag your group and youre only on the fourth hole
now if i have to come out here again youre done for the day
well pick it up sir
the ranger shoots them a look and drives off toward the two asian foursomes waiting on the tee behind them
the four guys are unnaturally bunched together on another fairway
where did you last see it
on the course
where on the course
i dont know on a fairway i think
i clot out grabbed my club took a swing and when i turned around it had disappeared
youre telling us you lost your golf cart
dude wheres my golf cart
shut up fred
guys i gotta go poo again
i didnt lose it i think it was stolen
who would steal a golf cart
does anyone have any napkins
look all i know is i had it on the seventh tee and now its gone
what are you talking about
were only on the sixth hole
did we miss a hole
wheres my kids
rick closes his eyes and rubs his head trying to keep it together
then he notices something o
oh come on man
another angle reveals hog head down in a greenside bunker pulling up his pants
as he starts to kick sand over his o
poop like a cat in its litter box we hear a noise and the guys look up
their pov the golf ranger comes flying over a hill heading straight for them
run for it
the guys run toward ricks cart jump in and take off
rick and fred are in the seats while gary and hog head hang off the back
the cart barrels down a cart path with the ranger hes gaining on us
i cant go any faster ive got it floored
cut through the woods
without slowing down rick turns sharply to the right and gary and hog head tumble out of the cart
with panic etched across their sweaty faces gary and hog head quickly jump to their feet and run after the cart
rick slows just enough for them to catch up and jump back on then he speeds down a maintenance path and disappears into the ed and kimmy long are sitting
at an outside table having lunch with their two young children
their year old daughter is again dressed just like her mother and the year old son is dressed like the father
hey mom look
the family turns to see
their pov a stoned looking rick fred hog head and gary are driving the golf cart down the city street
they stop at a traffic light beside them
all the guys stare straight ahead zombie like except for fred who notices the longs
the light changes and as the golf cart drives off through the busy intersection we go back on ed and kimmy shaking their heads
their poor wives
law order music cue as we super its a picture perfect day as a thousand people watch a cape cod league baseball game rom the comfort of their picnic blankets
the home team has loaded the bases in the bottom of the ninth and grace maggie maggies parents and the kids are clapping along with the crowd
the batter hits a rope to right field and as the tying and winning runs score the place goes wild
the players and fans mingle on the field immediately after the game
grace and maggie stand near the pitchers mound as they watch maggies kids run the bases
the wives look tanned and refreshed from several days laying on the beach
just then a big goofy kid named gerry approaches
hes a strapping year old first baseman from puerto rico with a perpetual shit eating grin
hey im gerry thanks for coming out and supporting us
oh it was fun
you guys looked good
gerry glances back at his teammates who are clearly egging him on
we saw you sitting up there with those little kids are you nannies or something
the girls arent immune to flattery and they smile
no theyre my kids
you have three kids
a couple other players amble over
dudes theyre not nannies theyre mommies
well she is not me
im not old enough yet
maggie and the players laugh
the players turn to see their coach rick coleman approaching with maggies father mid s
time to pack things up lets go
the players quickly scatter
maggie grace this is rick coleman the coach
rick coleman is a granite jawed year old with a good head of hair and an easy going manner
i hope those clowns werent bothering you
oh no they were sweet
so youre the guy whos been taking money off my dad every saturday on the golf course
i hate to break it to you but your old mans the one whos been taking all the money hes a thief
maggies father laughs
hey everyones coming back to my place for some beers and a barbecue why dont you join us
oh thanks but weve gotta get the kids home
your mom and i will take em home
you two go out and have a good time cripes you havent been out all week
grace perks up at this
oh i dont know dad we really excuse me can i have a word with you
grace pulls maggie aside
whats your problem
oh come on grace these guys are barely out of college and in case youve forgotten were married
last i heard rick and fred had the week off from marriage
so remind me again who are we married to
maggie thinks about this
i guess one beer wont kill us
thats my girl
grace glances over at the ballplayers
why shouldnt we have fun
god knows our guys are living it up
what would you guys rather do make out with a guy or let him blow you
pull back to reveal that
our five guys are sitting at the bar drinking beer and devouring plates of hot wings
around them we see about fifty tvs blaring twenty different sporting events
theres espn logos everywhere and not a woman in sight
and youve gotta pick one or someone in your family will die thats the rule
oh boy thats a toughie
how long would you have to make out with him
and how long would he have to blow you
i mean getting blown by a dude is bad but making out with a guy its so
you think its more intimate than getting blown by a guy
all right the hell with this shit im outta here
baker gets up from his stool
i wanted to watch you guys pick up chicks not talk about dicks
hey greased lightning let off the gas sometimes these things take time
this is day three and you havent even talked to a girl
thats not exactly accurate gary
thanks to your scrumptious brownies i did spend half of last night talking to judy on the drug and poison hotline
hog head and gary stand
i guess im gonna get going too
yeah this is boring
you guys are pussies
hey i havent seen you guys talk to any girls
we dont have hall passes
come on guys lets go
the three friends start to leave but hog head stops and turns
hey guys its all right if you strike out
but for godsakes at least take a couple of swings
a moment later the guys are gone and a humbled rick and fred sit there feeling alone
this is actually good you know that theyre leaving
you dont need five hunters to bag two birds
no you do not
and i love those guys but lets be honest theyre not exactly chick magnets
you can say that again
yep the steak always looks better if you trim away some of the fat
and lets face it we are the steak
dream team baby
the guys clink beers
then maybe we should call the girls and ask them to come home
fred glances at him aghast
who are we kidding man
do you really think were going to be picking up any girls this week
why wouldnt we
because thats not us anymore
wait a second
you want to quit
fred were not the same guys we were fifteen years ago back when we were single
fred stares at him incredulous
no man youve changed
all you care about is yourself what about all the guys out there who are counting on us to make this thing work
what are you talking about
dont you get it
were the chosen ones
fred stands up and points at rick
thats right this thing is bigger than us
our wives didnt give us this hall pass the good lord did
and what do we have to show for it
come off it fred
obviously hooking up isnt something we really want if it was we couldve done it by now
could we have
rick is taken aback by this
i mean if wed really wanted to
i did want to
and you know how close i got
were three days in and the only woman ive spoken to was our waitress at outback
and she never even made eye contact
i dont really care if some waitress makes eye contact
i want to go home i miss my wife and kids
let me explain something to you if grace and maggie find out we cant get laid on our own theyll start thinking we need them to get laid
do you know what thatll do to the balance of power in our homes
itll destroy it
rick thinks about this and grows alarmed
well what if we just tell them that we did hook up
she always knows when im lying
hey what about a massage parlor
thats giving up
fred glares at him
you dont get it do you
a hall pass aint all about sex
its about being man enough to pick up a woman even though you may not be what in the traditional sense is considered
makes quotes with good looking or
finger quotes again appealing
rick seems stung by this news
look if we cant show that something positive can come from having a hall pass then the whole concept is dead
not just for us
but for all mankind
rick thinks about this for a moment then stands up with a all right lets get out of here
i know exactly where we should be
the partys in full swing
a hundred or so players players girlfriends and friends are in and out of the pool drinking beer and rocking out to arcade fire on the boombox
angle on maggie and rick coleman sipping beers while in the b
we see grace playing volleyball in the pool still in the shorts and t shirt she wore that afternoon
so how about you rick do you have any children
nah but maybe some day
your mom keeps talking about hooking me up with your cousin kate
thats not a good sign
no i hardly know her
she moved to miami when i was eight
thats what your mom said
i coach at the university of miami
then you should go out with her
so how about yourself how long you been married
we were college sweethearts
and where is he this week
hes up in boston
all work and no play huh
maggie forces a smile
something like that
suddenly grace is propelled out of the water and up onto stop it
what are you doing
gerry laughs and bounces around the pool and grace and maggie and the coach cant help but laugh along with him as we rick and fred pull into the hotels
lot in the mini van
as rick gets out fred reaches behind his seat and comes out clutching a motorcycle helmet
rick stares at him
chicks dig motorcycles
its s night and a hall oates cover band is playing complete with look alikes except oates is black
behind the band theres a banner that reads ramada inn proudly welcomes the mutual of omaha leadership council
we see middle aged corporate types everywhere
oh oh here she comes watch out boy shell chew you up
oh oh here she comes shes a maneater
angle on the bar where rick and fred are checking out the scene
fred is wearing the helmet
its a huge black oversized helmet with a visor
he pulls it off shakes out his hair and places it prominently on the bar
rick notices something o
how about those two
angle on two pretty latino women sitting alone at a table
fred pulls a piece of paper out of his back pocket and hands it to rick
i went on line this afternoon and wrote down some good pick up lines to break the ice
will you help me find my puppy
i think he ran into the cheap hotel across the street
thats a good one except for one thing we dont have a puppy so when she gets there shell realize were full of shit
rick shoots him a look
i dont think its supposed to be for real
its just to make her laugh so shell talk to you
fred considers this
oh god no it doesnt work on that level
here this is my favorite
he takes the paper from rick
you must be from ireland because when i look at you my penis is dublin
its a charmer but you know what
we dont need phony pick up lines
why dont we just be ourselves
if you know how to
rick takes a deep breath and braces himself
give me the helmet
fred hands him the helmet then rick marches up to the two latino women with the helmet under his arm and fred close on his heels
the women give him a pleasant look
fred gives a little wave from behind rick
long beat as rick tries to figure what to say next
this is awkward
i feel like im back at my first junior high school mixer
rick and fred force a laugh and the girls smile
another long uncomfortable beat
rick clears his throat
are you ladies from ireland
im very surprised to hear that news because when i look at you my penis doubles in size
the women flinch at this losing their smiles
fred leans in
no he means his dick is dublin
like the city
as the girls turn away from them we begin a
music montage hall oates i cant go for that plays as our guys get shot down by a dozen different beautiful women
rick and fred are at the bar looking tired and frustrated
i have this overwhelming urge to donkey kick everyone in this bar
okay tiger keep your chin up no one said this was going to be easy
even in college you had to take fifty rejections for every score remember
yeah but it didnt sting so much when i was drunk
fred perks up
we should be drinking
were too stiff
way too stiff
we gotta start pounding em get those creative juices flowing bring the soul to the surface
thats when were at our most charming
a hammered fred is holding a hand over one eye as he shouts at a table full of gorgeous young women
you say no to me
you say no to me
i say no to you
hes being restrained by an unusually patient bouncer
in the b
we see rick passed out on a stool in a very awkward come on buddy lets go
the women glare at fred with disgust maybe even a little amusement
no screw them
pointing at the women you think your shit dont stink
well i got news for ya i wouldnt titty bang you in a snow storm
mocking oh please sir please titty bang us in a snow storm
the women laugh
nope you blew it not gonna happen
still restraining fred there you go mister you got em good
now lets go
as the bouncer drags him toward the exit a stunning girl passes them wearing tight leather pants with an american flag print on the butt
fred turns to her
hey sweetie you need a pole for that flag
just then the girls large boyfriend appears and as his fist meets freds face we law order music cue as we super
a snoring rick is fast asleep sprawled out on his back on the bed wearing only his boxers despite the clock next to him reading in the afternoon
hes surrounded by several left over room service trays
another angle reveals fred curled up naked on the bathroom floor also snoring
he uses a bath mat as a pillow
law order music cue as we super a worn out looking rick is working at his desk when fred approaches with a black eye
i know what weve been doing wrong
rick lifts his chin
if were gonna break out of this slump weve got to start using our strength
and that is
people who know us like us
so we should go after the women weve already won over
you mean like our wives
yeah like that but not them
fred sits in the chair across from rick
i was thinking coffee girl
youve won over coffee girl
well im sure shed recognize me
rick thinks about this
look if you really want to go after someone you already know have you considered missy frankenfield
shes got all the stats you like shes beautiful you k now her phone n ow number shes freshly divorced
which according to hog head means shes horny
as fred smiles we maggie and grace are laying outintheir bathing suits when they hear o
yelling and lookupto see the baseball player gerry waterskiing toward them
helets go of the rope and skis up onto the shore
whats up beach bunnies
grace and maggie sit up and smile
what are you doing here
he kicks off the ski then runs over and shakes his wet body gerry stop it
hey where are the kiddies
we thought wed take you all for a boat ride
my parents took them to marthas vineyard for the weekend
just then we hear a loud horn
they look up to see the boat pulling close to shore
rick coleman is behind the wheel and a couple players are in the back
all right everybody aboard
were going waterskiing
the two women look at each other why not
as they get up and run into the water we
rick stands in line at the coffee shop looking casual in slacks and a harvard t shirt
he peers ahead and sees the wannabe artist type taking the order of a teenage girl
at the other register coffee girl is also taking orders
rick is hoping to get coffee girl but wannabe gets to him first
can i take your order
rick sees that theres no one behind him
he turns to the wannabe
i dont know what i want
wannabe stares at him waiting
rick hesitates a few moments then levels with the guy
look man i want her to take my order
uh she knows how i like it
little help leigh your unique barista skills have been requested
rick waves weakly to leigh and winks
as leigh approaches wannabe mocks rick by waving at him and winking
what would you like
rick was hoping to have a conversation but wannabe is crowding them
with two splendas
leigh rings him up
thatll be two dollars
rick hands her a fiver and nods toward the speakers
by the way nice tunes
do you choose em or do they come down from corporate
its snow patrol
she hands rick his change and he dumps it in the tip jar
pretty solid movie too
wannabe barks out a laugh
dude youre thinking of snow do s the cuba gooding kiddie flick
this is snow patrol the band
rick shrugs a little embarrassed
thanks for the tip
as leigh grabs a cup and goes to make the coffee wannabe says something to her that we cant hear and they both laugh
a phone rings in the employee room
leigh hands wannabe the coffee then runs back to answer it
wannabe hands rick the iced coffee and winks at him
enjoy your two splendad iced coffee mister
rick starts to go then turns around and stares at wannabe
wannabe comforted by the counter between them smiles back
why are you smiling
you think this counter is some alligator infested moat
ricks stare becomes a glare and wannabe loses his smile
this little im on the inside too cool for school lets laugh at the routines gonna get you hurt
after you lose all of your familys money on your avante garde piece of crap short film youre going to need a job
and its guys like me that hire
and guys like me dont hire punks like you
so shape up
as rick turns and walks out we pan over to see that leigh rick sits alone at a table on the sidewalk drinking his coffee
he notices some postcards advertising a two week free trial at the local gym and starts to read them
i work out there
rick looks up suddenly finding himself alone with leigh
leigh nods and starts to straighten up the tables
i work out at home but i was thinking of going public with my work outs
what do you squat
she seems amused by this
i dont really squat just run on the hamster wheel everyday after work
she starts wiping down a table
so did you go to harvard
she nods at ricks t shirt
i mean you know
i went to a party there once
coffee girl giggles and rick perks up
actually this is harvard health care
snoring too much
holds up gym postcard so is this a good place to join
and they have a bar so i always grab a beer after my workout
sounds like a nice routine
maybe ill routine it too
if you join tell em leigh sent you theyll give me two free months
ill do that leigh
leigh gives him the peace sign
r o c k in the u s a
leigh smiles and as she heads back inside we fred is sitting on his bed flipping through his address book until he comes to missy frankenfield
he hits the speakerphone and dials
several rings later hi this is missy
sorry i missed your call
im out of town for a few days and i may have limited cell reception
please leave a message and ill get back to you as soon as i can
fred mouths the word shit then picks up the receiver
hey missy this is fred searing
uh i dust wanted to give you a ring and um
well give me a call when you get back
its kind of an emergency
well not life threatening but the machine cuts him off
fred hangs up dejected
he sits there for a beat then grabs his keys and goes out the door
tight on fred hes wearing shades and has a baseball cap pulled down over his eyes
pull back to reveal that hes outside a massage parlor
as he approaches the massage parlor entrance a bunch of ladies walk out of the travel agency just to the right so fred veers into the dry cleaners to the
fred enters and immediately bumps into kimmy long eds wife standing in line behind several other women
she is accompanied by her year old daughter and neither of them look happy to see him
kimmy nods blankly
the daughter glares at him
fred nervously steps up next to them in line passing time as he waits for the sidewalk to clear
um i dont think i got a chance to tell you how impressed i was with your new place
kimmy grunts a thank you and turns away from him
angle on the korean lady who owns the dry cleaners
she stands behind the desk with an accordion wall behind her
searing you pick up last week no more clothes here
fred smiles uncomfortably at kimmy
looks at watch well gotta get going i have a meeting across town in ten minutes
fred comes out of the dry cleaners makes sure the coast is clear then ducks into the massage parlor
a young korean woman is behind the counter
you want massage
fred looks around
theres an old korean lady sitting on a couch
he looks at the young korean woman and nods
you fill out
the young korean woman hands fred a form
fred puts it down and covertly moves in
id prefer no paper trail
need for insurance company
i dont think my insurance companys gonna cover this one
ten dollar co pay

fred moves in closer
look i dont really want this in print
the young korean woman hands him back the form
how i know what you want if you no fill out form
um couldnt i just tell you
she stares at him for a long beat
so what you waiting for
fred glances back at the old korean lady then whispers in the young korean womans ear
she nods and looks at him
but must see i
fred sighs and pulls out a hundred dollar bill
how about a c note so i dont have to fill out any forms or show any i
the young korean woman thinks about this for a moment then slides open the accordion wall behind her revealing
the dry cleaners next door the dry cleaning korean lady looks back at him along with kimmy long her daughter and gentleman want a rub and tug with tea bag
happy ending but dont fill out form
kimmy long glares at him appalled
as fred backpedals out of the massage parlor he waves at her weakly and we
one hundred guests dance on the top deck of this large ship as the bee gees night fever blasts from the speakers
night fever night fever
we know how to do it
as the song heats up the crowd parts revealing
rick coleman and gerry decked out in white tony manaro suits
theyre dancing up a storm with maggie and grace who are thrilled to be in such capable hands
grace is getting tossed around a bit but its clear that maggie can hold her own on a dance floor
the crowd soon forms a circle around the two couples and as rick and gerry swing and lift our delighted and breathless wives we maggie and rick coleman are standing
at the rail of the boat taking a breather
you can really move out there
maggie shrugs modestly
i was a dance major in college
i always wondered what do you do with a degree in dance
well as it turned out nothing
i guess the original plan was to go to new york and try to hook up with one of the big dance companies but then i got married and
your priorities change
she looks away maybe a little embarrassed
anyway that was fun
i havent danced this much in a long time
i dont know you get busy kids school theres so much going on
well you gotta make time for the stuff you love or youll forget who you are
maggie appreciates the sentiment
she makes strong eye contact with rick for a moment but catches herself and looks away
you know my husbands name is rick
rick smiles at this
well that makes me the perfect guy to have an affair with youd never have to worry about screaming out the wrong name during sex
maggie smiles at this but she seems a nick uncomfortable
now come on lets go find grace and get something to eat
as they head back to the party we rick is parked across the street from fitness firm health club
hes reading the newspaper and glancing at the entrance for leigh
suddenly theres a loud tap on the window and rick looks over to see flats who we met at ricks poker night standing outside with a shit eating grin
rick rolls down the window
how you doing man
whats up with you
hows that hall pass thing going
rick makes a scooby doo sound alarmed
who told you about that was it hog head
some old lady was yakking about it down at the post office
rick reacts to this
so whats the deal you getting laid
i dont know where youre getting your information flats but a hall pass isnt just about getting laid its about getting a week off from marriage to do as you
please whether that be fishing or watching tv whatever it is that relaxes you
oh i didnt know that
just then rick notices leigh dressed in work out clothes walking down the sidewalk toward the gym
uh flatsy i gotta run
im late for my work out appointment
when rick hops out of his car we see that hes wearing gym shorts and an old springsteen t shirt
he hesitates then grabs a sweatshirt out of the car and ties it around his waist
rick hurries down the sidewalk toward leigh
you decided to go for it
as rick follows leigh into the gym a smiling flats calls hey rick
good luck with the fishing
as flats begins to laugh a sheepish rick scurries into the building
rick and leigh stand at the front desk
a young buff dude clyde looks up from folding towels
clyde this is my friend uh
hes looking to join
ill get you signed up
leigh pats ricks hand
she turns to leave
so uh are you gonna grab a brewski after your work out
rick looks disappointed
im gonna grab two
leigh flashes him a smile and as she walks away she gives him the peace sign
he returns it
as soon as he hears himself rick cringes
close on ricks face hes wearing the headphones and has worked up a pretty good sweat
pull back to reveal that hes sitting on the toilet
we hear a flush
rick shuffles out of a stall and moves to a sink
while he washes his hands a young naked metrosexual type whips his leg into the sink beside him
rick slowly turns to look
ricks pov as the metrosexual talks to another naked man he fills his hand with shaving cream and the hand disappears between his own legs
the guys continue their conversation unfazed
then the metrosexual starts to shave his balls
as rick dries his hands he cant contain himself
whats that about you swimming the english channel
the metrosexual shoots rick an annoyed look
nah just not into looking like the knuckle dragging guy on the evolution of man chart
off rick looking self consciously down at his fur covered body we go
rick enters the empty hot tub room takes off his towel and eases into the steaming water
he hits a button and the jets kick on full blast turning the hot tub into a bubbly
he bunches up his towel and puts it behind his head then settles in and closes his eyes
rick is in a deep sleep
his mouth is wide open but his head is barely above water as he snores loudly
he dips beneath the surface and as he begins to choke and cough he wakes up
rick takes a moment to get his bearings then struggles to get out of the hot tub
but his muscles have turned to jelly
when none comes a life and death struggle ensues as the flabby middle aged dad tries to climb to safety
just as rick starts to go under the two young naked metrosexuals hear his moans and come to his rescue
they jump in the hot tub and heave him ashore
as rick gasps for air one of the metrosexuals kneels down and lifts ricks head onto his naked lap
are you having chest pains sir
no no i think i was
in the hot tub too long
i cant feel my body
how long were you in there
what time is it
about three hours
thats when rick realizes that his head is resting on the guys cock
he tries to roll off him but metrosexual try not to move sir
im okay just help me up
all right give him a hand
metrosexual straddles ricks chest and leans down to pull him up
as rick starts to rise his face comes perilously close to the second mans o
dangling cock and rick has to they finally get rick to his feet
as the naked men help him across the room we angle on two tanned hairless metrosexual asses flanking ricks hirsute butt
okay thanks guys
i can take it from here
the metrosexuals release rick and he gets about two steps before his legs give out and he tumbles down a small flight law order music cue as we super a
depressed rick and fred sit in bed numbing their pain by watching the bourne supremacy and eating a couple pints of we let down the male species
i really thought our hall passes might change the philosophy of marriage in america
fred eats a big scoop of ice cream
i envisioned a national holiday right between july th and labor day like the first friday in august hall pass day a day for husbands to get some strange a
day that would forever be known as the holiday that saved the institution of marriage
all right dont give up
im not giving up im facing facts this is our last day and we got nothing cooking
maybe you were right
maybe we should just tell the girls to come home
i want the hall pass
fred looks at rick surprised
at first i wasnt sure but now i want the dream
im not even sure i know what the dream is anymore
i just want to know what its like to be with another woman
well just pull up one of the golden oldies in your spank bank its almost like being there
i dont have anything in that spank bank
im talking about all the girls before you met maggie
rick doesnt say anything
no youre not serious
rick lowers his head
wait a second are you saying
but how can that be you didnt meet maggie until college
what do you think everyone gets laid in high school
i got news for you mister getting laid in high school is not a right its a privilege
fred puts down his ice cream
first class first day freshman year i saw maggie she was sitting three seats away in western civ and i fell in love instantly
i begged her for three months to go out with me she finally caved and that night i told her i loved her
eighty four days later she told me she loved me back and weve been together ever since
fred stares at him
thats a really creepy story
just then freds cell phone rings and he answers it
oh okay great
fred hangs up but doesnt say anything
who was that
just an angel from heaven
suddenly fred jumps to his feet
coakleys back in town
as ricks face fills with renewed hope we
maggie and grace are sitting at the kitchen table gazing at a bouquet of flowers and an open gift box displaying an does this mean youre going steady
thats not funny
i feel terrible the poor kids spending all his hard earned money on me thats sad
cute but sad
grace you should be flattered
youre thirty eight years old and college kids are still swooning over you
well i just feel bad if i gave him the wrong impression
the wrong impression
what makes you think that i mean besides the flowers i
bracelet and love letter
maggie picks up a card
dearest grace our final game is tonight
please meet me at the coachs place afterwards to celebrate
yours truly gerry
thanks for piling on
grace stands up and sighs
i cant accept this
i guess im just gonna have to go set him straight
rick and fred are sitting at a table sharing a pizza while fred texts someone
what are you doing
just texting missy frankenfield that were going to be at enter the dragon im covering all my bases
you dont need missy frankenfield tonight
if we cant get the job done with coakley as our wingman then were pathetic
just then fred notices something o
all right here come da man
close on restaurant entrance a suave debonair man played by george clooney comes through the doors and stops to check out the room
rick and fred jump up and approach him with open arms but at the last second clooney steps aside revealing a thin balding man dressed head to toe in motorcycle
leathers think larry david
my two favorite nutsuckers how the hell are ya
the three men hug then coakley nods toward clooney
see who just walke in here in front of me
whats he doing here
i dont know must be shooting a movie or something
look man weve got a situation on our hands
yeah yeah baker filled me in
sbeen rough sledding huh
coakley puts his arms around the two guys
well dont worry my little snickerdicks
a mass of beautiful girls and slick guys vie for position outside this crowded club
reverse angle reveals rick fred and coakley watching from across the street
im gonna need three hundred bucks
coakley shoots him a look
if youre really serious about this stop questioning me
the guys look at each other then reluctantly cough up the dough
with money in hand coakley marches confidently across the street followed by fred and rick
when the slick bouncer sees them approaching he parts the crowd
good evening mr
what up my guy
coakley passes on the money with a handshake and the bouncer unhooks the velvet rope
then coakley smiles back at fred and rick
push the defrost button on the microwave boys
the deep freeze is over
coakley leads them into the club
rick and fred cant believe all the beautiful people around them
okay guys you tried it your way and you railed miserably
you struck out you were oh for everything
so now we do it my way which is
the guys look at coakley like richard gere looks at the dalai lama
go ugly early
rick and fred are visibly deflated
guys youre not trying to get married here youre trying to get laid
arent you the guy who goes to the hawaiian tropic finals every year
is that for the ugly girls
i go to the tropic finals because miss north dakotas gonna lose and shes gonna need a hug
and quite often you can parlay a hug into a hand job
rick youre up get us two bottles of moet and six glasses
rick shoots fred a look then weaves his way through a scrum of people up to the bar
he tries to flag down a bartender but cant get anyones attention
rick turns to see that hes crammed in beside his babysitter paige whos looking a little tipsy
oh hey paige
what are you doing here
she pulls out her license and holds it up
i turned twenty one yesterday
im legal now
well happy birthday
you out celebrating
yeah im here with my aunt meg
paige points across the club to aunt meg a striking redhead early s whos talking to a couple of young men
shes the best
forty two years old but she still parties like shes my age
rick continues to try to get the bartenders attention
so rick hows the hall pass going
paige smirks at rick who shrinks a little
you dont mind if i call you rick do you
i am officially an adult now
no of course not what did you just say
i was asking about your hall pass
off ricks look i baby sit for the putneys and i heard gary talking about it the other night at their barbecue
rick reacts to this
he was talking about it at a barbecue
oh he wasnt saying it in a bad way
in fact i thought it was very classy of you to be staying at the holiday inn express instead of bringing girls back to your home with all the kids
pictures and schoolwork taped up everywhere
rick forces a smile
a male bartender finally appears in front of rick
yeah um two bottles of moet and six glasses please
paige eyes rick as she sips her drink
so does it work both ways
the hall pass
does your wife get one too
uh no no
a hall pass is for men only
who made that rule
as rick thinks about this paige moves in tighter
by the way i kind of owe you an apology
lowers her voice last week ful when you drove me home i shouldnt have snapped at you like that
oh dont worry about it
it was a big misunderstanding
no it wasnt
she takes a moment looks around
if you thought i was coming on to you that night its because
rick flinches at this
just then the bartender returns with the champagne
rick fumbles through his pocket and finally pays
then hes left alone with paige and her coed in love with the professor eyes and her suddenly heaving cleavage
i have to go paige but it was great seeing you
paige grabs ricks arm as he tries to go
she looks suddenly annoyed
are you serious
youre doing this again
even with a hall pass
paige youre my kids babysitter
have a happy birthday
as rick walks away we go back on coakley and fred as rick arrives with the champagne
here we go bubbles doth floweth
look whos here
the guys turn to see the coffee girl leigh walking past with two of her girlfriends
she sees them and lights up
what happened yesterday i thought we were gonna grab a beer
fred looks at rick confused
yeah i got a little caught up in my curls and reps and shit
so is this your playground
nah ive never been here but a friend of mines dj ing tonight so i promised him id come
just then wannabe from the coffee shop swoo s in and gives leigh a kiss on the cheek
he has a pair of headphones hanging around his neck
wannabe notices rick and loses his smile
what are you doing here you auditing the place
actually i work for sirius xm radio were looking to hire some new deejays so im checking out all the clubs
wannabe stiffens suddenly respectful
are you serious
leigh is amused by this but she tries to hide it from the deflated wannabe
oh thats hip
turns to leigh why dont you hit the dance floor the next songs gonna be for you
as leighs girlfriends pull her onto the dance floor wannabe returns to his deejay booth
when were you two going to have a beer
no no no leigh and i just belong to the same gym and happened to be there at the same time yesterday afternoon
what gym do you belong to and where the hell was i
well according to kimmy long you were at the massage parlor trying to get a rub and tug without filling out the paperwork
this takes the wind out of freds sails
coakley chuckles and rick glares at fred
i thought the massage parlor was admitting defeat
i had a knot in my neck why the hell didnt you tell me you saw coffee girl
okay guys cut the crap
were all here for the same thing
and ill give you a hint what that thing is it begins with a p and ends with an ussy
coakley puts his arm around fred
now relax fredd everyones gonna get taken care ot
looks out at crowd we just gotta find you a gazelle with a bad wheel
coakley spots something
ooh theres a couple of trainwrecks
whoa wait a second
but coakley steers fred over to two chubby not so attractive blondes laying on a bed in the corner
ladies this is my friend fred pinkberry his yogurt company just went public and hes out celebrating
hed like to offer you a flute of champagne
the chubby blondes perk up
i love pinkberry
as the girls make room for a reluctant fred we go
back across the room where we see rick watching leigh and her hot girlfriends dance
leigh catches rick staring
he smiles and clumsily shoots her the peace sign
finally he takes a deep breath and dances his way up next to her
having a good time
just chillin and wigglin
long beat as they dance
then i havent been ancing in a long time
i can tell
just try to keep up
she smiles at this then coakley dances up beside rick and abort
you stand not a chance
no no i think were starting to gel
coakley rolls his eyes
no no youre mistaken
look dude this aint operation cock block here now trust me retreat
rick glances back at leigh torn
she looks fantastic
coak im never gonna have another hall pass so this memory has to last a lifetime
you know what i mean
coakley looks at leigh and sighs
all right ill be at the bar when this thing blows up in your face
as rick dances back over to leigh we
pan across the room to the pissed off wannabe watching them from the deejay booth
all right all adult swims over
now if you was born before youre gonna want to step off the floor cause were about to kick it up
on rick he looks over at wannabe but continues to dance
is this guy your boyfriend or something
no no no
she waves it off then shrugs guiltily
one time we messed around a little
and what does messed around a little mean these days
rick tries hard to act nonchalant
he kissed me one night and i kissed back i shouldnt have
seriously you grandpappies better get off the floor before someone falls and breaks a hip
rick points at wannabe
just play your funky music white boy
as the music shifts gears and becomes faster and louder we maggies at the sink cleaning up when she notices that the answering machine light is blinking
she dries her hands then pushes the button
on answering machine hola maggie this is isabel
i went to clean the house today but nobody has been there or slept in any of the beds this week so i just cleaned the windows and left early
i hope you dont mind
close on a concerned looking maggie
she moves to the window stares at the lights on the ocean
maggie turns to see rick coleman standing out on her front porch
she goes to the screen door
thought you might want to help me celebrate the end of the season
he holds up a grocery bag
i got some good late night eats
maggie hesitates a moment
then she opens the door and lets him in
a bored looking fred is smooshed between the chubby blondes on the bed
it was the greys you know the tall skinny aliens and they were all over my yard but and heres the weird thing i wasnt at all afraid of them
so when they asked me if i wanted to get in their spaceship i said sure and i walked right on
oh my god youre so brave
i would never ever in a million years climb into one of those things
fred would you ever just walk into a ufo on your own
if they came right now i would sure
there you are
fred looks up to see missy frankenfield approaching
oh my god
fred jumps off the bed and gives missy a hug
franken berry how the heck are ya
she returns the embrace but not quite as tight
you look incredible
thanks fred you look good too
never felt better
i have to say i cant believe im actually here i was on my way home from dinner when i noticed your text
so whats this big emergency
oh uh yeah
by emergency i just meant that theres some important stuff i want to talk to you about
you know one on one me and you without all the husbands and wives and hoopla
so how are you
no i mean how are you
whats happenin in there
there must be all sorts of emotions churning up with the divorce and everything
she gives him a long look
maybe we should go somewhere else this doesnt seem like the best place to spill ones guts
just then coakley swoops in and pulls fred aside
what part of go ugly early didnt you understand
youve got a better chance of winning husband of the year than tagging that chiquita
fred flinches at this
i know her
she said she wants to leave with me
then shes insane run for the hills
coak the womans going through a divorce
shes not insane shes just making really poor decisions right now
hands him his car keys here give rick the keys to my mini van
im gonna go back to the hotel with missy
coakley looks back at missy and softens
its your funeral princess
back on rick and leigh dancing up a storm
rick is out of breath and sweating like a pig
his shirt is soaked and his hair is dripping wet
are you okay you keep checking your pulse
nah im fine
i had a little chest cramp during the last song but i worked through it
she smiles at this
come on lets sit this one out
i need a breather
they move to the bar and rick starts drying himself with a stack of cocktail napkins
so whats up with the ring
he looks at his finger then back at her
have you ever heard of a hall pass
grace pulls up in her camry and gets out
she hears music coming from inside and hesitates a beat before walking nervously onto the porch and knocking
a moment later gerry appears in the doorway
there she is
come on in im mixing up some margaronis
we lost our final game but i got four hits
uh where is everyone
they all went out to party now get in here
but grace stays on the porch
gerry im sorry but i cant stay
grace hasnt been in this situation in a long time and it shows
gerry steps out onto the porch looking concerned
is everything okay
yeah yeah everythings fine but
holds up gift box i cant accept this
grace does a double take
gerry im a married woman
gerry nods at this maybe a little hurt
she hands him the box and he reluctantly accepts it
im sorry if i made you uncomfortable grace
its just that
i really like you
i like you too gerry and you didnt make me uncomfortable
she smiles at him and he forces a smile back and theres some serious eye contact and then bam
they dive at each other and start sucking face like theres no tomorrow
as they continue to maul each other they stumble into the house and we rick and leigh are leaning against the bar
i wasnt deliberately hiding it
he holds up his ring hand
yeah i just thought your wife had died or something and you were wearing it out of respect
shes still hangin in there
just then coakley pulls rick aside
come on youre not gonna close the sale here lets move this clambake back to my place
okay but what am i gonna do there
what do you mean what are you gonna do
ive got a house with bedrooms do the math
when it doesnt work out with her which it wont theres going to be a bunch of other back up chicks there
rick nods then turns to leigh
my buddys inviting everybody back to his crib
as they walk toward the exit we fred and missy are walking down the hallway toward his room
ive got to be honest fred
im not really sure what were doing here
what do you mean
were hangin were connecting thats what friends do
especially if they want to take it to the next level where they can call each other good friends
he comes to his room and starts to unlock the door
youre married fred
ah blah blah blah blah
fred opens the door but missy stays in the hall
what does blah blah mean
you are still married right
look i dont want to get into all the details but my wife gave me this one time deal where i get to be with another woman
he opens the door wide
she looks at him for a beat
i thought we were going to the hotel bar
theres a mini bar in my room
you better hurry up its last call
are you out of your flippin mind
fred loses the smile
are you out of your mind
im going to be honest with you your tone right now is scaring me
you call me up for the first time in your life claim you have some kind of emergency and it turns out that you just want to screw me
well screw you fred
she starts walking down the hallway
fred nods unfazed
nail on the head
she turns and glares at him
what you just said i had that coming
fred hangs his head
seriously missy i
i dont know whats gotten into me this week
i think i must be having some kind of mid life crisis or something because ive been acting like a real jackass
anyway ease forgive me
i really am very very sorry and ashamed
missy standing a few feet away finally calms down
you want to come in for that drink
he arches an eyebrow
fuck you fred
missy storms away
no thank you would have sufficed
fred walks into his room and closes the door
fred goes to the mini bar and pours himself a drink
he looks around the room
the weeks over and hes failed miserably
he sits on the bed
then a knock
fred gets up and opens the door
may i help you
reverse angle reveals paiges aunt meg
shes wearing a skirt and low cut tank top and has cougar written all over her
rick my names meg
im your babysitter paiges aunt and i just wanted to come over here and tell you this they dont make men like you anymore
well thank you
would you like to come in
a guilt ridden grace is just finishing getting dressed when gerry comes out of the bathroom buttoning up his shirt
no everythings not okay
he moves close to her and she grows uncomfortable
look youre a great cguy gerry and youre very charming and very sweet and the last thing i wanted to do was hurt your feelings but
well what just happened can never happen again
gerry looks confused
i know its probably hard for you to understand but
i love my husband
what does that have to do with anything
fate threw us together and we went with it isnt that what lifes all about
grace looks at him recognizing the youth and triteness of his words
it wasnt fair to my husband
and it wasnt fair to you because this could never become anything more than just
what it was
she looks at him and shrugs apologetically
gerry barks out a laugh
i know that
of course i do
i mean no offense but lets face it youre a lot older than me
she flinches a little embarrassed
a quick reality check for grace
i dont mean that in a bad way
im just saying i didnt think we were going to start dating you know
could you imagine the looks wed get
itd be like hugh hefner and his girlfriends except in reverse
youd be hugh hefner
yeah i got that part
gerry looks at his watch
ooh i gotta get going
we have kind of a team meeting in like twenty minutes
gerry sees grace glance at the clock a
its uh kind o a tradition that we always get together on the night of the last game
it would probably be uncool if i missed it
you dont have to explain
seriously though thanks for everything that was awesome
he holds up his hand and she diligently high fives him
then gerry walks out the door
grace sits there alone for a moment
we push in on her and we hear gerrys car start outside and when grace starts to cry we this is a tudor home in an upscale brookline neighborhood
we can hear rage against the machine blasting from the street
theres thirty or so cars out front and people are still arriving
the place is jamming
its a nice house but under furnished in a bachelor pad kind of way
rick and leigh are in a corner drinking beers
i guess i still have a lot to get out of my system before i do the marriage trip
im one of those people who wants to try everything once before i die
have you ever been with a married guy
leigh pauses but she doesnt flinch
neither have i
rick winces but leigh smiles at him
its the moment of truth
id like to help you take being with a married guy off your list of things to do before you die
leigh gets close
i dont want to be a home wrecker
ive got a one time pass remember
that wasnt just a line
its for real
leigh seems intrigued
she moves closer still takes his hand
so where can we go to talk some more about this
um coakley has a game room upstairs
rick and leigh look over to see an agitated wannabe forcing his way through the crowd
where have you
why didnt you
you knew this was my big night
how could you just
turns away emotional look can i please talk to you in private
leigh looks apologetically at rick
can you give me a second
wannabe and leigh walk a few feet away and rick watches them have an animated conversation
it appears wannabe may even be crying
finally wannabe storms across the room but when he gets to the door he looks back at leigh
are you coming
leigh sighs then approaches rick
im sorry rick
i have to go deal with this
rick cant believe whats happening
i thought you said he wasnt your boyfriend
but he is a friend
leigh glances at the broken down wannabe standing there at the door then turns back to rick
before rick can stop her leigh leaves the party with wannabe
after a long beat rick slides down into a chair maggie is spilling her guts to rick coleman as he stands over the stove making pancakes
and he hasnt even spent one night in his own bed this week
let me get this straight you gave him his freedom and now youre mad that hes acting free
this logic clearly stings maggie
hey im sure theres an explanation
maybe he took a trip somewhere
i called his assistant hes been in the office almost everyday
look maggie for all you know your husbands been working at a sou kitchen sleeping in his car al week and hes only gotten laid two or three times at
she looks up and forces a smile
maggie checks her watch
jeez i wonder whats taking grace so long
well if she went over to break the kids heart the least she could do is lend a sympathetic ear
he flips a pancake onto a plate
prepare yourself for heaven
she reaches for the plate but he slaps her hand away
not so fast lady
im not finished
you have not lived until youve had my steaming hot blueberry pancakes
he pulls a carton of vanilla ice cream out of a bag
a la mode
oh my lanta
and to wash it all down
rick reaches into the bag and pulls out a dessert wine
off maggies smile we a glum rick is walking through the packed party when he bumps into baker and hog head standing around a keg with a group of hey
what are you guys doing here
were here for the hall pass
i thought you guys had given up on us
were here with them
he nods toward rick leary and willy boshane both early s and paunchy
what are you talking about
when leary and boshane heard about your guys hall pass they convinced their wives to give them one too
a smiling leary tries to high five rick but hes having none of it
he turns to baker livid
you werent supposed to tell anyone about the hall pass
they didnt say anything
our wives heard about it at the pool
at the pool
rick rubs his face distressed
and then about three days ago after some hard core negotiating we managed to push the bill through
the guys laugh
rick can hardly believe what hes spawned
hows it going
were building mucho momentumo
baker makes a jerk off motion
hey baker a hall pass aint just about sex you know
its about going bowling and uh staying up late and being able to do what you want to do when you want to do it
havent gotten laid yet huh
its a lot tougher than we thought it would be
just then gary comes around a corner
hey dudes theres like ten very bangable chicks out on the back deck lets go
leary holds up his beer
the guys tap their beer cups then exit toward the back deck
a dejected and defeated rick watches them go then turns and pushes his way through the crowd to the front door
as he opens the door to leave he finds himself face to face with hey where are you going
what are you doing
i thought youd left
i told you i just had to talk him off the ledge
i calmed him down and sent him on his way
so wheres that game room
i thought we were gonna play some games
she smiles and takes his hand and as they walk away we go
rick and leigh walk down the hall to the game room
he opens the door and flips on the light
their pov theres a pool table a few pinball machines a bar and a bed
ill be right back i just have to use the bathroom
rick nods then watches as leigh walks off and disappears into the bathroom
he takes a deep breath
this is it
just then he hears o
rick heads down the hallway and pushes open a door
reverse angle reveals coakley sitting all alone in a small study off the hall
he has a bowl of capn crunch on his lap and is watching a re run of the andy griffith show
how come youre not downstairs partying
coakley gives him a sad worn out smile
all partied out pal
rick nods understanding
coakley laughs once again at the man that barney fife still kills me
he looks back to rick
hey i was thinking about this hall pass business
its really ironic isnt it
rick glances down the hall to see if leigh has returned
well think about it
theres two kinds of guys who cheat on their wives the guy who does it behind her back and a guy like you who has his wifes permission
well its not really cheating if i have permission
the point is if you asked a hundred people who the better cjuy is ninety nine of em would pick you because youre being honest theres no deceit involved
rick is growing uncomfortable
but the funny thing is the other guy the cheater the bad guy he has to live with all that guilt and anxiety while his wifes running around happy as
a clam because she doesnt know anything
and you the good guy youve got no guilt at all because you just laid it all on your wifes shoulders
well i didnt really think of it
its like shes your guilt sherpa
coakley chuckles and rick deflates
and that my friend is why you are a genius
as rick lets this all sink in we paiges aunt meg is sitting on the couch
her legs are crossed revealing a lot of skin
fred hands her a glass of wine and sits beside her
they clink glasses
rick i hope you dont mind me tracking you down paige told me where you were staying
not at all
youve been very sweet to her
fred waves her off
hey shes a good kid
i do what i can for the kids
aunt meg moves in a little closer squints at him sweetly
she told me everything
and i have to say i was very impressed
i know she tried to hook up with you twice in fact and that you set her straight both times
fred hadnt heard this from rick and is a little confused
rick enough with the chivalry
paige wanted to sleep with you and you didnt take advantage of her
im just saying thats very cool
he shrugs modestly
shes a kid and kids get crushes
i remember in tenth grade i had the biggest crush on my french teacher thank god mr
leclaire was professional enough to only date seniors
im serious it takes a certain kind of guy to say no to a beautiful young girl like that especially since you have your wi es permission now
meg shoots him a knowing smile and puts her glass down
i like that rick
you have morals
she leans in and kisses his neck
fred glances down at her breasts
hey all you have in this world is your word
as aunt meg climbs on top of fred we rick enters to find leigh playing a pinball machine
leigh turns and smiles at rick
leigh i gotta split
yeah i kind of hit a wall
she can hardly believe her ears
are you feeling okay
youre not mad because i went outside with my friend are you
no no no
look i shouldnt be doing this
you know commitments
leigh nods at this then unties a shoulder strap and her dress falls to the floor
suddenly shes naked before him and shes perfect
um you dropped something
for a moment nobody moves
we can almost hear ricks heart beat
then leigh steps closer to him and rick instinctively leans back
dont think so much
youre gonna have your wife for the rest of your life but tonight
you have me
and its the kind of smile you only get two or three times in your life if youre lucky and probably never from a woman this beautiful
she reaches down and unbuckles his pants then she pulls off his shirt
they stand face to face now the middle aged guy and the young beauty and its happening exactly the way rick had hoped it would the dream
she presses her body against his and starts to kiss his neck her hand disappearing somewhere below his waist
then she leans her head against his chest
as he looks down at her we push in on a suddenly conflicted rick
i cant do this
he reaches for his shirt
what are you doing
she stares at him confused as he buckles his pants
your wife didnt give you a hallway permission slip did she
yes she did but
look youre insanely beautiful and pathologically sexy and every cell in my body is telling me to dust do this but rick points to his chest
see this area this spot right here
the first time maggie and i slept together back in college she fell asleep right here
and she left a puddle of drool
and it didnt bother me
it actually felt good
thats when i knew i was going to marry her
and when my kids emma and gunnar when they were babies this is where they slept
or sometimes at four oclock in the morning emma would just lay there and stare up at me
it was where we first got to know each other
so im sorry leigh but as amazing as i think you are
i gotta go home
rick shrugs apologetically
well i think you have a screw loose and youre probably going to regret this for the rest of your life but
right on man
do you want me to give you a ride home
its only one thirty im going back down to the party
rick raises two fingers
r o c k in the u s a
as they smile at each other one last time we rick is pulling away from coakleys house when the car phone rings
rick pushes a button to answer
yes is this fred searing
oh uh no im sorry hes not here right now
im using his car
well would you know where i could find him
this is sgt
polisner of the massachusetts state police
as rick grows alarmed we fred is still on the couch with aunt meg on the floor in front of him
freds pants are down to his ankles leaving him with only his boxers on
meg kisses his chest and stomach then leans back and takes off her tank top revealing extra large bazookas stuffed into a slinky bra
im attracted to men with integrity
thanks wow you got great jugs
meg takes freds hand and leads him toward the bed with his pants still at his ankles fred waddling like a penguin
moral guys a tit man huh
well i grew up in the midwest
she pushes him down on the bed and fred quickly kicks off his pants and shoes but keeps his boxers on
meg tackles him and the two of them start to roll around under the covers
fred seems to be working his way down her stomach
i want you to make love to me
just then rick bursts into the room out of breath
fred and meg come up from under the covers
fred is at waist level on her
fred i need to talk to you
meg glares down at fred confused
i thought you were rick
fred cowers guiltily
please dont judge me
as aunt meg karate kicks fred in the face we fred now dressed hurries across the parking lot with rick on his heels
fred has blood stained tissue stuffed up his nose
what did they tell you
is grace gonna be okay
all i know is she was in a car accident and they rushed her to the hospital
oh my god
suddenly they hear o
they look up and their pov from fifty yards across the parking lot they can see that freds mini vans windshield has just been bashed in by the bat wielding
on the side of the vehicle is spray painted horny old man
what the hell
wannabe turns to them a crazed look on his face
how do you like me now splenda boy
you moron thats lny car
his is the one next to it
wannabe looks over at ricks avalon pulls out a knife and quickly slashes two of ricks tires
as rick and fred run toward him wannabe jumps into an old bronco and peels out of back on rick and fred as they slow down and catch their
nice job fred
the mini van blows by a sign that reads cape cod the windshield is gone and the wind blows back rick and freds hair as if they were on a
fred tries his car phone as he drives
oh come on
how can a hospital not have a live operator
its four in the morning fred
fred hangs up and pounds his steering wheel
what was i thinking
i had a great wife a beautiful wife and now i may lose her
because of you
what are you talking about
you said our wives were living their dreams with their fancy gas ovens and that our dream was the hall pass
how can you blame this on me
id never even heard of a hall pass until you flaunted yours in my face
hey look at me ive got a hall pass everyone should have a hall pass
you ruined my life mills
maggie and rick coleman sit on the back deck drinking wine
this is a great place
yeah my familys had it since i was a kid
we used to come for a week a summer then two weeks then a month then by the time i got to high school we were living here all summer
somethings wrong here maggie
somethings wrong with a guy who would leave a woman like you alone for this long
well you know
i did give him a hall pass
if you were my girl i wouldnt have taken it
an awkward moment
rick touches her hand and maggie looks away
you deserve way better
uh in ricks defense he didnt really even want the hall pass
i kind of forced it on him
why would you do that
maggie thinks about this
i dont know
i guess i felt like he wasnt noticing me anymore
j guess i wanted to feel
and the truth is in my heart i never thought hed go through with it
he brushes her hair from her face and they look into each others eyes
he leans in and she does too and right when it looks like they may kiss maggie hesitates as suddenly oh my god
this hall pass
it wasnt for him
and as they hang on that realization we a police cruiser is parked on the highway divider
two young cops are relaxing with their coffees when the did you see that
he didnt have a windshield
cop throws the car into drive and they pull a u ey and fred looks regretful
im sorry man i shouldnt have blamed you for this
im the one who dragged you into this thing
no you didnt
i went willingly
ive been bad rick
ive been real bad
weve both been bad
ive been worse
i kissed your babysitters aunt
thats not so bad
on the vagina
they hear a siren and rick looks back to see the cops on their tail
the battered mini van blows by the welcome to cape cod hedges with the cop car on their tail
fred isnt slowing down
he grows more determined
pull over man
no way i can out run em
no you cant not in this thing
we see another police cruiser fishtail out of a side street and join the chase
oh god now theres two of em
i dont care im not stopping til we get there
are you crazy
yeah im crazy
im crazy about my wife
rick and fred come skidding up to the emergency room entrance in the graffitied mini van
the two young cops screech to a stop behind the mini van as the second cruiser flies up behind them
the officers spring from their cars and quickly tackle fred as he runs toward the front doors
rick climbs out of the passenger seat with his hands raised
hear me out gentlemen i can explain everything
a burly officer from the back up car form tackles rick blasting him backwards onto the sidewalk
fred and rick manage to roll away and then crawl through the our guys barely get in the door before being pummeled to the floor by the four cops
the two people seated in the waiting room stand up in shock and then a swarm of doctors and orderlies come running in to see what the commotion is
grace needs me
cop pins freds head to the floor as cop lays across his legs
okay just take it easy buddy
no i wont take it easy
look im sorry i was speeding and i shouldnt have run from you guys but my wifes been in an accident and shes in this emergency room and i gotta
see how she is because
the cops look moved and unsure what to do
are you the husband of
glances down at chart grace searing
fred strains to look up
is she okay
the doctor hesitates and the cops look at each other and then the burly officer releases rick from his head lock
all right let him up
the young officers get off fred and help him up
fred rushes to the doctor who seems very serious
please tell me shes gonna be okay
your wife broke her nose and she got shaken up a bit but all in all shes a very lucky woman
you got that wrong doc
im the lucky one
fred is visibly relieved as the doctor smiles and walks off
bless you doctor
fred turns to rick and the two men hug and then rick grabs fred by the shoulders and looks him in the eye
you take care of that woman buddy and im gonna go home and take care of mine
fred nods emotional as the cops look at each other unmoved
rick starts to walk away
rick stops and turns at the door
you go love that lady
the burly officer rolls his eyes and steps up to rick
uh before you go love that lady were going to have to write you guys up
as the officer pulls out his citation pad we rick pulls up in the wrecked mini van and gets out
rick steps quietly into the house
he sees two empty bottles of wine and two half filled glasses on the coffee table
then he hears maggies o
voice coming from the bedroom
oh my god
oh my god
oh my and
on rick he looks concerned as he approaches the bedroom door
rick enters to find maggie laying in bed
talking on the oh my god
oh my god you poor thing
maggie looks up shocked to see rick
hold on rick just walked in
grace was in a car accident
maggie goes back to the phone
and they let you go
so youre on your way
i love you too honey
she hangs up
my god she scared me to death
march twenty fifth
the day i lost my virginity

maggie thinks about this
what are you talking about
we were dating then
she looks at him not sure if she understands
you were my first
and you were my last
and you were everything in between
as it all sinks in maggie starts to well up
is that why you were crying that first night
rick shrugs embarrassed
and i was
i was your last
you are my only
maggie smiles and runs into his arms
they kiss and its a real kiss the kind they havent had in a long while
law order music cue as we super the sky is lightening but the sun hasnt risen yet
a taxi van pulls up and fred gets out
fred has a black eye
he helps grace out of the van then pays the driver
grace has two black eyes and her nose is heavily bandaged
when the taxi drives off fred helps grace toward the house
and what were you doing driving around at one oclock in the morning
i was upset so i went for a drive you know to think and i must have hit a patch of sand and before i knew it i was into
fred stops and looks her in the eye
im sorry grace
for putting you through all this
grace looks awash in guilt
its not your fault fred
yes it is of course its my fault
this isnt you driving around all night thinking youre not a thinker
when she looks up at him he forces a smile
but she doesnt smile back
look fred we have to talk about
about what happened this week
fred takes a deep breath and looks around trying to avoid the moment
do we really have to do this
grace lowers her head guiltily
yeah we do
when she looks back up she notices the spray painted and horny old man
oh no honey thats not me they were talking about rick
grace looks at him confused
suddenly fred falls to his knees
look all you gotta know is that whatever happened doesnt matter
i love you and only you
and im going to treat you like the queen that you are for the rest of your living days so help me god
ill mow the lawn ill shovel the snow ill wash the stubble off the sink
grace looks down at him
but please im begging you sweetie

graces eyes flicker about hardly believing her luck
fred gets up and throws his arms around his wife
i love you fred
as they embrace fred sees rick come out the front door with his arm around maggie
fred shoots rick a thumbs up
close on rick and maggie as they smile at fred and grace
come on you two

hall oatess when the morning comes begins to play and as our two happy couples hold hands and walk off toward the beach we pull up up up and
