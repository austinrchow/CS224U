b if window
href b b screenplay by ethan coen joel coen he is a bespectacled man in his thirties hale but somewhat bookish
he stands tuxedoed in the wings of a theater looking out at the stage listening intently to end of a performance
in the shadows behind him an old stagehand leans against a flat expressionlessly smoking a cigarette one hand on a thick rope that hangs from the ceiling
the voices of the performing actors echo in from the offscreen stage im blowin out of here blowin for good
im kissin it all goodbye these four stinkin walls the six flights up the el that roars by at three a
like a castiron wind
kiss em goodbye for me maury
ill miss em like hell i will
not this time lil
im awake now awake for the first time in years
uncle dave said it daylight is a dream if youve lived with your eyes closed
well my eyes are open now
i see that choir and i know theyre dressed in rags
but were part of that choir both of us yeah and you maury and uncle dave too
the suns coming up kid
theyll be hawking the fish down on fulton street
let em hawk
let em sing their hearts out
thats it kid
take that ruined choir
make it sing
so long maury
we hear a door open and close then approaching footsteps
a tall dark actor in a used tweed suit and carrying a beat up valise passes in front of barton from offscreen stage well hear from that kid
and i dont mean a postcard
the actor sets the valise down and then stands waiting int he shadows behind barton
an older man in work clothes not wardrobe passes in front of barton from the other direction pauses at the edge of the stage and cups his hands to his
as the man walks back off the screen lets spit on our hands and get to work
its late maury
not any more lil
barton mouths the last line in sync with the offscreen actor its early
with this the stagehand behind barton furiously pulls the rope hand over hand and we hear thunderous applause and shouts of bravo
as the stagehand finishes bringing the curtain down somewhat muting the applause the backstage actor trots out of frame toward the stage
the stagehand pulls on an adjacent rope bringing the curtain back up and unmuting the applause
barton fink seems dazed
he has been joined by two other men both dressed in tuxedos both beaming toward the stage
looking across a tenement set at the backs of the cast as the curtain rises on the enthusiastic house
the actors take their bows and the cry of author author goes up from the crowd
the actors turn to smile at barton in the wings
he hesitates unable to take it all in
he is gently nudged toward the stage by the two tuxedoed gentlemen
as he exits toward the stage the applause is deafening
pushing a maitre d who looks back over his shoulder as he leads the way through the restaurant
your table is ready monsieur fink
several members of your party have already arrived
pulling barton is garland stanford here
he called to say hed be a few minutes late
ah here we are
toward a large semi circular booth
three guests two me and a woman in evening wear are rising and beaming at barton
a fat middle aged man one of the tuxedoed gentlemen we saw backstage is moving out to let barton slide in
barton barton so glad you could make it
you know richard st
barton nods and looks at the woman
and poppy carnahan
were drinking champagne dear boy in honor of the occasion
have you seen the herald
barton looks sullenly at his champagne glass as the fat man fills it
well i dont want to embarrass you but caven could hardly contain himself
but more important richard and poppy here loved the play
yeah it was a corker
thanks richard but i know for a fact the only fish youve ever seen were tacked to a the wall of the yacht club
nevertheless we were all devastated
what did the herald say
i happen to have it with me
please derek do read it do
bare ruined choirs triumph of the common man
the star of the bare ruined choirs was not seen on the stage of the belasco last night though the thespians involved all acquitted themselves admirably
the find of the evening was the author of this drama about simple folk fish mongers in fact whose brute struggle for existence cannot quite quell their longing for something
the playwright finds nobility in the most squalid corners and poetry in the most callused speech
a tough new voice in the american theater has arrived and the owner of that voice is named
theyll be wrapping fish in it in the morning so i guess its not a total waste
well we can enjoy your success barton even if you cant
dont get me wrong im glad itll do well for you derek
dont worry about me dear boy i want you to celebrate
all right but i cant start listening to the critics and i cant kid myself about my own work
a writer writes from his gut and his gut tells him whats good and whats
well i dont pretend to be a critic but lord i have a gut and it tells me it was simply marvelous
and a charming gut it is
baying aaa woooooooo
barton turns to look for the source of an insistent jingling
we swish pan off him to find a busboy marching through the restaurant displaying a page sign bell attached with bartons name on it
a distinguished fifty year old gentleman in evening clothes is nursing a martini watching barton approach
as he draws near
i thought you were going to join us
jesus garland you left me alone with those people
dont panic ill join you in a minute
whats you think of richard and poppy
barton scowls the play was marvelous
she wept copiously
millions of dollars and no sense
garland smiles then draws barton close
we have to talk a little business
ive just been on the phone to los angeles
barton capitol pictures wants to put you under contract
theyve offered you a thousand dollars a week
i think i can get them to go as high as two
to do what
what do you do far a living
im not sure anymore
i guess i try to make a difference
no pressure here barton because i respect you but let me point out a couple of things
one here you make a difference to five hundred fifty people a night if the show sells out
eighty five million people go to the pictures every week
to see pap
yes generally to see pap
however point number two a brief tenure in hollywood could support you through the writing of any number of plays
i dont know garland my place is here right now
i feel im on the brink of success id say youre already enjoying some
barton leans earnestly forward
no garland dont you see
not the kind of success where the critics fawn over you or the producers like derek make a lot of money
no a real success the success weve been dreaming about the creation of a new living theater of about and for the common man
if i ran off to hollywood now id be making money going to parties meeting the big shots sure but id be cutting myself off from the wellspring of that
success from the common man
he leans back and chuckles ruefully
i guess im sprouting off again
but i am certain of this garland im capable of more good work
maybe better work than i did in choirs
it just doesnt seem to me that los angeles is the place to lead the life of mind
okay barton youre the artist im just the ten percenter
you decide what you want and ill make it happen
im only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism if i can use that word and hollywood in the same breath
barton glumly lights a cigarette and gazes out across the floor
garland studies him
look they love you kid everybody does
you see cavens review in the herald
no what did it say
take my copy
youre the toast of broadway and you have the opportunity to redeem that for a little cash strike that a lot of cash
garland looks at barton for a reaction but gets none
the common manll still be here when you get back
what the hell they might even have one or two of em out in hollywood
absently thats a rationalization garland
garland smiles gently
barton it was a joke
we hear a distant rumble
it builds slowly and we cut to crushing against the pacific shore
the roar of the surf slips away as we dissolve to a high wide shot from the front door looking down across wilting potted palms brass cuspidors turning green ratty
wing chairs the fading decor is deco gone to seed
amber light afternoon turning to evening slopes in from behind us washing the derelict lobby with golden highlights
barton fink enters frame from beneath the camera and stops in the middle foreground to look across the lobby
we are framed on his back his coat and hat
the lobby is empty
there is a suspended beat as barton takes it in
barton moves toward the front desk
as barton stops at the empty desk
he hits a small silver bell next to the register
its ring out goes on and on without losing volume
after a long beat there is a dull scuffle of shoes on stairs
barton puzzled looks around the empty lobby then down at the floor behind the front desk
it swings open and a young man in a faded maroon uniform holding a shoebrush and a shoe not one of his own climbs up from the basement
he closes the trap door steps up to the desk and sticks his finger out to touch the small silver bell finally muting it
the lobby is now silent again
welcome to the hotel earle
may i help you sir
im checking in
the clerk flips through cards on the desk
f i n k
that must be you huh
okay then everything seems to be in order
everything seems to be in order
he is turning to a register around for barton to sign
are you a tranz or a rez
transient or resident
i dont know
i mean ill be here uh indefinitely
thatll be twenty five fifty a week payable in advance
checkout time is twelve sharp only you can forget that on account youre a rez
if you need anything anything at all you dial zero on your personal in room telephone and talk to me
my name is chet
well im going to be working here mostly at night im a writer
do you have room service
kitchen closes at eight but im the night clerk
i can always ring out for sandwiches
the clerk is scribbling something on the back of an index card
though we provide privacy for the residential guest we are also a full service hotel including complimentary shoe shine
my name is chet
he pushes a room key across the counter on top of the index card
barton looks at the card
on it chet
barton looks back up at the clerk
they regard each other for a beat
okey dokey go ahead
what dont you wanna go to your room
barton stares at him
what number is it
the clerk stares back
six oh five
i forgot to tell you
as barton stoops to pick up his two small bags those your only bags
the others are being sent
the clerk leans over the desk to call after him ill keep an eye out for them
ill keep my eyes peeled mr
barton is walking to the elevator
barton enters and sets down his bags
an aged man with white stubble wearing a greasy maroon uniform sits on a stool facing the call panel
he does not acknowledge bartons presence
after a beat six please
the elevator man gets slowly to his feet
as he pushes the door closed next stop six
barton walks slowly toward us examining the numbers on the doors
the long straight hallway is carpeted with an old stained forest green carpet
the wallpaper shows faded yellowing palm trees
barton sticks his key in the lock of a door midway down the hall
as barton enters
the room is small and cheaply furnished
there is a lumpy bed with a worn yellow coverlet an old secretary table and a wooden luggage stand
as barton crosses the room we follow to reveal a sink and wash basin a house telephone on a rickety night stand and a window with yellowing sheers looking on
an air shaft
barton throws his valise onto the bed where it sinks jittering
he shrugs off his jacket
pips of sweat stand out on bartons brow
the room is hot
he walks across the room switches on an oscillating fan and struggles to throw open the window
after he strains at it for a moment it slides open with a great wrenching sound
barton picks up his underwood and places it on the secretary table
he gives the machine a casually affectionate pat
next to the typewriter are a few sheets of house stationary we pan up to a picture in a cheap wooden frame on the wall above the desk
a bathing beauty sits on the beach under a cobalt blue sky
one hand shields her eyes from the sun as she looks out at a crashing surf
the sound of the surf mixes up
looking at the picture the surf mixes up louder
we hear a gull cry
the sound snaps off with the ring of a telephone
on the nightstand next to the bed
with a groan of bedsprings barton sits into frame and picks up the telephone
how dya like your room
who is this
barton wearily rubs the bridge of his nose
how dya like your room
as bartons head drops down into frame against it
he reaches over and turns off the bedside light
he lies back and closes his eyes
a long beat
we hear a faint hum growing louder
barton opens his eyes
a naked peeling ceiling
the hum a mosquito perhaps stops
his eyes move this way and that
after a silent beat he shuts them again
after another silent beat we hear muffled probably from am adjacent room a brief dying laugh
it is sighing and weary like the end of a laughing fit almost a sob
we hear the rising mosquito hum
barton fink is ushered into a large light office by an obsequious middle aged man in a sagging suit
there are mosquito bites on bartons face
from behind a huge white desk a burly man in an expensive suit gets to his feet and strides across the room
is that him
lemme put my arms around this guy
he bear hugs barton
how the hell are ya
he separates without waiting for an answer
my name is jack lipnik
i run this dump
you know that you read the papers
lipnik is lumbering back to his desk
lou treating you all right
got everything you need
what the hells the matter with your face
what the hells the matter with his face lou
its not as bad as it looks just a mosquito in my room place okay
to lou where did we put him
im at the earle
never heard of it
lets move him to the grand or the wilshire or hell he can stay at my place
thanks but i wanted a place that was less
sure say it its not a dirty word
sat whatever the hell you want
the writer is king here at capitol pictures
you dont believe me take a look at your paycheck at the end of every week thats what we think of the writer
to lou so what kind of pictures does he like
fink hasnt given a preference mr
hows about it bart
to be honest i dont go to the pictures much mr
lipnik thats okay thats okay thats okay thats just fine
you probably just walked in here thinking that was going to be a handicap thinking we wanted people who knew something about the medium maybe even thinking there was all
kind of technical mumbo jumbo to learn
you were dead wrong
were only interested in one thing can you tell a story bart
can you make us laugh can you make us cry can you make us wanna break out in joyous song
is that more than one thing
the point is i run this dump and i dont know the technical mumbo jumbo
why do i run it
ive got horse sense goddamnit
and also and i hope lou told you this i bigger and meaner than any other kike in this town
did you tell him that lou
and i dont mean my dicks bigger than yours its not a sexual thing although youre the writer you would know more about that
yes thank you
lou immediately rises and leaves
lipniks tone becomes confidential he used to have shares in the company
an ownership interest
got bought out in the twenties muscled out according to some
hell according to me
so we keep him around hes got a family
hes sensitive dont mention the old days
oh hell say whatever you want
look barring a preference bart were gonna put you to work on a wrestling picture
i say this because they tell me you know the poetry of the street
that would rule out westerns pirate pictures screwball bible roman
he rises and starts pacing
but look im not one of these guys thinks poetic has gotta be fruity
were together on that arent we
i mean im from new york myself well minsk if you wanna go way back which we wont if you dont mind and i aint askin
now peoplere gonna tell you wrestling
wallace beery its a b picture
you tell them bullshit
we dont make b pictures here at capitol
lets put a stop to that rumor right now
lou enters with coffee
talking about the wallace beery picture
we got a treatment on it yet
no not yet jack
we just bought the story
saturday evening post
okay the hell with the story
wallace beery is a wrestler
i wanna know his hopes his dreams
naturally hell have to get mixed up with a bad element
and a romantic interest
you know the drill
romantic interest or else a young kid
what do you think lou
wally a little too old for a romantic interest
look at me a writer in the room and im askin lou what the goddamn story should be
after a robust laugh he beams at barton
well bart which is it
there is a disappointed silence
lipnik looks at lou
lou clears his throat
maybe we should do a treatment
ah hell let bart take a crack at it
hell get into the swing of things or i dont know writers
lets make it a dame bart keep it simple
we dont gotta tackle the world our first time out
the important thing is we all have that barton fink feeling but since youre barton fink im assuming you have it in spades
seriously bart i like you
were off to a good start
dammit if all our writers were like you i wouldnt have to get so goddamn involved
id like to see something by the end of the week
lou is getting to his feet and signaling for barton to do likewise
heard about your show by the way
my man in new york saw it
tells me it was pretty damn powerful
pretty damn moving
a little fruity he said but i guess you know what youre doing
thank you for your heart
we need more heart in pictures
were all expecting great things
we are in the sixth floor hallway of the earle late at night
a pair of shoes sits before each door
faintly from one of the rooms we can hear the clack
of a typewriter
it grows louder as we track forward
close on the typing so that we see only each letter as it is typed without context
one by one the letters clack on a u d i b l e
after a short beat a period strikes
elbows on his desk he looks down at what he has just written
he rolls the paper up a few lines looks some more
it says on manhattans lower east side
early morning traffic is audible
after a beat he rolls the sheet back into place
the letter strike area
it is lined up to the last period which is struck over by a comma
the words as is are typed in and we cut back to as he continues typing
he stops after several more characters and looks
breaking the silence muffled laughter from an adjacent room
a mans laughter
it is weary solitary mirthless
barton looks up at the wall directly in front of him
the picture of the girl on the beach
staring as the end of the tether laughing continues
barton looks back down at his typewriter as if to resume work but the sound is too insistent to ignore
the room barton sitting at his desk staring at the wall
barton pushes his chair back goes to the door opens it and looks out
the empty hallway a pair of shoes before each door
at the end of the hall a dim red bulb burns over the door to the staircase punctuating the sick yellow glow of the line of wall sconces
the laughter though still faint is more resonant in the empty hall
perhaps its quality has changed or perhaps simply because it is so insistent the laughter now might be taken for weeping
barton pauses trying to interpret the sound
he slowly withdraws into his room
barton looks down at his typewriter for a beat
the laughter weeping continues
he walks over to his bed sits down and picks up the house phone
this is barton fink in room
yes theres uh theres someone in the room next door to mine and hes uh
making a lot of
after a beat thank you
he cradles the phone
the laughter continues for a moment or two then abruptly stops with the muffled sound of the telephone ringing next door
barton looks at the wall
the muffled sound of a man talking
the sound of the earpiece being pronged
muffled footsteps next door
the sound of the neighbors door opening and shutting
footsteps approaching the hall
a hard present knock at bartons door
barton hesitates for a beat then rises to go get the door
as barton opens it
standing in the hall is a large man a very large man in short sleeves suspenders and loosened tie
his face is slightly flushed with the beginnings of sweat
somebody just complained
hastily no i didnt i mean i did call down not to complain exactly i was just concerned that you might not that its my business but that you might
be in some kind of
you see i was trying to work and its well it was difficult yeah
im damn sorry if i bothered you
the damn walls here well i just apologize like hell
he sticks his hand out
my names charlie meadows
i guess were neighbors
without reaching for the hand
unfazed charlie meadows unpockets a flask
neighbor id feel better about the damned inconvenience if youd let me buy you a drink
thats all right really thank you
all right hell you trying to work and me carrying on in there
look the liquors good wuddya say
as he enters you got a glass
its the least i can do
a quick one sure
he gets two glasses from the wash basin
charlie sits down on the edge of the bed and uncorks his flask
yeah just a nip
i feel like hell all the carryings on next door
thats okay i assure you
its just that i was trying to work what kind of work do you do barton if you dont mind my asking
well im a writer actually
you dont say
thats a tough racket
my hats off to anyone who can make a go of it
damned interesting work id imagine
not easy but damned difficult id imagine
as he hands charlie a glass and whats your line mr
call me charlie
well barton you might say i sell peace of mind
insurance is my game door to door human contact still the only way to move merchandise
he fills a glass with whiskey and swaps it for the empty glass
in spite of what you might think from tonight im pretty good at it
doesnt surprise me at all
because i believe in it
fire theft and casualty are not things that only happen to other people thats what i tell em
writing doesnt work out you might want to look into it
providing for basic human need a fella could do worse
thanks ill keep it in mind
what kind of scribbler are you newspaperman did you say
no im actually writing for the pictures now pictures
im sorry brother i was just sitting here thinking i was talking to some ambitious youngster eager to make good
hell youve got it made
writing for pictures
beating out that competition
and me being patronizing
he gestures toward his face is the egg showing or what
thats okay actually i am just starting out in the movies though i was pretty well established in new york some renown there oh its an exciting time then
im not the best read mug on the planet so i guess its no surprise i didnt recognize your name
jesus i feel like a heel
for the first time barton smiles
thats okay charlie
im a playwright
my showsve only played new york
last one got a hell of a write up in the herald
i guess thats why they wanted me here
hell why not
everyone wants quality
what kind of venue that is to say thematically uh
what do i write about
caught me trying to be fancy
yeah thats it bart
well thats a good question
strange as it may seem charlie i guess i write about people like you
the average working stiff
the common man
well aint that a kick in the head
yeah i guess it is
but in a way thats exactly the point
theres a few people in new york hopefully our numbers are growing who feel we have an opportunity now to forge something real out of everyday experience create a theater
for the masses thats based on a few simple truths not on some shopworn abstractions about drama that doesnt hold true today if they ever did
he gazes at charlie
i dont guess this means much to you
hell i could tell you some stories and thats the point that we all have stories
the hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king
its the stuff of life why shouldnt it be the stuff of theater
goddamnit why should that be a hard pill to swallow
dont call it new theater charlie call it real theater
call it our theater
i can see you feel pretty strongly about it
well i dont mean to get up on my high horse but why shouldnt we look at ourselves up there
who cares about the fifth earl of bastrop and lady higginbottom and and and who killed nigel grinch gibbons
i can feel my butt getting sore already
you understand what im saying a lot more than some of these literary types
because youre a real man
and i could tell you some stories sure you could
and yet many writers do everything in their power to insulate themselves from the common man from where they live from where they trade from where they fight and love
and converse and and and
so naturally their work suffers and regresses into empty formalism and well im spouting off again but to put it in your language the theater becomes as phony as a
three dollar bill
yeah i guess thats tragedy right there
frequently played seldom remarked
whatever that means
barton smiles with him
youre all right charlie
im glad you stopped by
im sorry if well i know i sometimes run on
jesus im the kind of guy ill let you know if im bored
i find it all pretty damned interesting
im the kind schmoe whos generally interested in the other guys point of view
well weve got something in common then
charlie is getting to his feet and walking to the door
well christ if theres any way i can contribute or help or whatever barton chuckles and extends his hand
sure sure charlie you can help by just being yourself
well i can tell you some stories he pumps bartons hand then turns and pauses in the doorway
and look im sorry as hell about the interruption
too much revelry late at night you forget there are other people in the world
see you charlie
charlie closes the door and is gone
barton goes back to his desk and sits
muffled we can hear the door of the adjacent room opening and closing
barton looks at the wall
the bathing beauty
from offscreen we hear a sticky adhesive giving way sound
he looks around to the opposite bed wall
the wallpaper is lightly sheened with moisture from the heat
one swath of wallpaper is just finishing sagging away from the wall
about three feet of the wall where it meets the ceiling is exposed
the strip of wallpaper its glue apparently melted sags and nods above the bed
it glistens yellow like a fleshy tropical flower
he goes over to the bed and steps up onto it
he smooths the wallpaper back up against the wall
he looks at his hand
sticky with tacky yellow wall sweat
he wipes it onto his shirt
we hear a faint mosquito hum
barton looks around
a typewriter whirring at high speed
the keys strike too quickly for us to make out the words
on barton sitting on a couch in an office anteroom staring blankly
distant phones ring
bartons eyes are tired and bloodshot
a gargoyle secretary sits typing a document
the office door opens in the background and a short middle aged man in a dark suit emerges
to his secretary im eating on the lot today he notices barton
the secretary looks over from her typing to consult a slip of paper on her desk
barton fink mr
im a writer mr
ted okum said i should drop by morning to see you about the ever act
no im we need indians for a norman steele western
im a writer
ted o think about it fink
writers come and go we always need indians

ted okum said youre producing this wallace beery picture im working on
ted okum doesnt know shit
theyve assigned me enough pictures for a goddamn year
what ted okum doesnt know you could almost squeeze into the hollywood bowl
then who should i talk to
geisler gives a hostile stare
without looking at her he addresses the secretary get me lou breeze
he perches on the edge of the desk an open hand out toward the secretary as he glares wordlessly at barton
after a moment is he in for mr
she puts the phone in geislers hand
hows lipniks ass smell this morning
okay the reason im calling i got a writer here fink all screwy
says im producing that wallace beery wrestling picture whatm i the goddamn janitor around here
yeah well whod you get that from
yeah well tell lipnik he can kiss my dimpled ass
no no all right
without looking he reaches the phone back
the secretary takes it and cradles it
okay kid lets chow
barton and geisler sit eating in a semicircular booth
geisler speaks through a mouthful of food dont worry about it
its just a b picture
i bring it in on budget theyll book it without even screening it
life is too short
but lipnik said he wanted to look at the script see something by the end of the week
sure he did
and he forgot about it before your ass left his sofa
im just having trouble getting started
its funny im blocked up
i feel like i need some kind of indication of
whats expected wallace beery
what do you need a road map
geisler chews on his cottage cheese and stares at barton
look youre confused
you need guidance
talk to another writer
geisler rises and throws his napkin onto his plate
jesus throw a rock in here youll hit one
and do me a favor fink throw it hard
barton stands at a urinal
he stares at the wall in front of him as he pees
after a moment he cocks his head listening
we hear a throat clearing as if by a tenor preparing for a difficult passage
it is followed by the gurgling ruch of vomit
barton buttons his pants and turns to face the stalls
there is more businesslike throat clearing
we boom down to show the blue serge pants and well polished shoes of the stalls kneeling occupant
a white handkerchief has been spread on the floor to protect the trouser knees
the toilet flushes
the man rises picks up his handkerchief up off the floor and gives it a smart flap
he quickly straightens and goes to the sink
he starts washing his hands
we hear the stall door being unlatched
barton glances over his shoulder
the stall door opening
quickly self consciously he looks back down at his hands
his hands writhing under the running water
we hear footsteps approaching
forcing himself to look at his hands
we hear the man reach the adjacent sink and turn on the tap
barton cant help glancing up
a dapper little man in a neat blue serge suit
he has warm brown eyes a patrician nose and a salt and pepper mustache
he smiles pleasantly at barton
he gives a nervous smile more like a tic and looks back down at his hands
we hear the man gargling water and spitting into the sink
after a moment barton looks up again
reacting to bartons look as he washes his hands
this time a curt nod accompanies his pleasant smile
looks back down then up again
extends a dripping hand
sorry about the odor
his speech is softly accented from the south
they shake then return to their ablutions
we hold on barton as we hear mayhews faucet being turned off and his foot steps receding
for some reason bartons eyes are widening
the dapper little man stops and turns
i beg your pardon
just bill please
barton stands with his back to the sink facing the little man his hands dripping onto the floor
there is a short pause
barton is strangely agitated his voice halting but urgent
mayhew cocks his head with a politely patient smile
finally barton brings out youre the finest novelist of our time
mayhew leans against a stall
why thank you son how kind
bein occupied here in the worship of mammon i havent had the chance yet to see your play he smiles at bartons surprise
yes mistuh fink some of the news reaches us in hollywood
he is taking out a flask and unscrewing its lid
sir im flattered that you even recognize my name
my god i had no idea you were in hollywood
all of us undomesticated writers eventually make their way out here to the great salt lick
mebbe thats why i allus have such a powerful thrust
he clears his throat takes a swig from the flask and waves it at barton
a little social lubricant mistuh fink
its still a little early for me
so be it
he knocks back some more
bill if im imposing you should say so i know youre very busy i just uh
i just wonder if i could ask you a favor
that is to say uh
have you ever written a wrestling picture
mayhew eyes him appraisingly and at length clears his throat
you are drippin suh
barton looks down at his hands then pulls a rough brown paper towel from a dispenser
mayhew sighs mistuh fink they have not invented a genre of picture that bill mayhew has not at one time or othuh been invited to essay
i have taken my stabs at the wrastlin form as i have stabbed at so many others and with as little success
i gather that you are a fresh man here eager for an upperclassmans council
however just at the moment
he waves his flask
i have drinkin to do
why dont you stop at my bungalow which is numbah fifteen later on this afternoon
he turns to leave
and we will discuss wrastlin scenarios and other things litrary
we are close on brass numerals tacked up on a white door
muted from inside we hear mayhews voice enraged bellowing
we hear things breaking
softer we hear a womans voice its tone placating
on barton standing in front of the door
the noise abates for a moment
we hear the womans voice again
barton hesitates listening he thinks decides knocks
with this the womans voice stops and mayhew starts wailing again
the door cracks open
the woman looks as if she has been crying
can i help you
im sorry i
my name is fink
uh bill asked me to drop by this afternoon

mayhew is indisposed at the moment from inside we hear mayhews wail
the woman glances uncomfortably over her shoulder and steps outside closing the door behind her
fink im audrey taylor mr
mayhews personal secretary
i know this all must sound horrid
i really do apologize
through the door mayhew is still wailing piteously
is he okay

she brushes a wisp of hair out of her eyes
i am sorry its so embarassing
how about you
will you be alright
ill be fine

audrey reaches out and touches bartons hand
ill tell bill you dropped by
im sure hell want to reschedule your appointment
perhaps you and i could get together at some point also
im sorry if that sounds abrupt
i dont know anyone here in this town
audrey smiles at him
perhaps the three of us mr
you see barton im not just bills secretary bill and i are
we audrey glances back as we hear the sound of shattering dishes and heavy footsteps
i know this must look
no no hurriedly we need each other
we give each other
the things we need mhoney
bastard ass sons of bitches
the waters lappin up
im sorry mr
please dont judge us
flustered she backs away and closes the door
hand printed on the package is the message hope these will turn the trick mr
the wrapping is torn away and the small box is opened
two thumbtacks are taken out
late at night
the swath of wallpaper behind the bed has sagged away from the wall again and has been joined by the swath next to it
barton enters frame and steps up onto the bed
he smooths up the first swath and pushes in a thumbtack near the top
on the tack
as barton applies pressure to push it in tacky yellow goo oozes out of the puncture hole and beads around the tack
smoothing up the second swath
as he pushes in the second tack he pauses listening
muffled through the wall we can hear a woman moaning
after a motionless beat barton eases his ear against the wall
as his ear meets the wall
the womans moaning continues
we hear the creaking of bedsprings and her partner incongruously giggling
barton grimaces gets down off the bed and crosses to the secretary where he sits
he stares at the paper in the carriage
the blank part of the page around the key strike area under the metal prongs that hold the paper down
we begin to hear moaning again
still looking sweating
tracking in on the paper losing the prongs from frame so that we are looking at the pure unblemished white of the page
the moaning is cut short by two sharp knocks
as it swings open
charlie meadows leans in smiling
how are you
jesus i hope im not interrupting you again
i heard you walking around in here
figured id drop by
yeah come in charlie
hadnt really gotten started yet what happened to your ear
for charles left ear is plugged with cotton wadding
as he enters oh yeah
an ear infection chronic thing
goes away for a while but it always comes back
gotta put cotton in it to staunch the flow of pus
dont worry its not contagious
seen a doctor
charlie gives a dismissive wave
whats he gonna tell me
cant trade my head in for a new one
no i guess youre stuck with the one youve got
have a seat
charlie perches on the corner of the bed
thanks id invite you over to my place but its a goddamn mess
you married bart
i myself have yet to be lassoed
he takes his flask out
got a sweetheart
i guess its something about my work
i get so worked up over it i dont know i dont really have a lot of attention left over so it would be a little unfair
yeah the ladies do ask for attention
in my experience they pretend to give it but its generally a smoke screen for demanding it back with interest
how about family bart
howre you fixed in that department
my folks live in brooklyn with my uncle
mine have passed on
its just the three of us now
he taps himself on the head chuckling
whats the expression me myself and i
sure thats tough but in a sense were all alone in this world arent we charlie
im often surrounded by family and friends but
youre no stranger to loneliness then
i guess i got no beef especially where the dames are concerned
in my line of work i get opportunities galore always on the wing you know what im saying
i could tell stories to curl your hair but it looks like youve already heard em
he laughs at his reference to bartons curly hair and pulls a dog eared photograph from his wallet
as he hands it to barton thats me in kansas city plying my trade
charlie smiles and waves with one foot up on the running board of a roadster
a battered leather briefcase dangles from one hand
it was taken by one of my policy holders
theyre more than just customers to me barton
they really appreciate what i have to offer them
ya see her hubby was out of town at the time you know in a way i envy you charlie
your daily routine you know whats expected
you know the drill
my job is to plumb the depths so to speak dredge something up from inside something honest
theres no road map for that territory
he looks from charlie to the underwood
and exploring it can be painful
the kind of pain most people dont know anything about
he looks back at charlie
this must be boring you
not at all
its damned interesting
he gives a sad chuckle
probably sounds a little grand coming from someone whos writing a wrestling picture for wallace beery
you got no beef there
hell of an actor though for my money you cant beat jack oakie
a stitch oakie
funny stuff funny stuff
but dont get me wrong beery a wrestling picture that could be a pip
wrestled some myself back in school
i guess you know the basic moves
nope never watched any
im not that interested in the act itself okay but hell you should know what it is
i can show you in about thirty seconds
he is getting down on his hands and knees
youre a little out of your weight class but just for purposes of demonstration thats all right really not a bit of it compadre
easiest thing in the world
you just get down on your knees to my left slap your right hand here
he indicated his own right bicep
and your left hand here
he indicated his left bicep
you can do it champ
all right now when i say ready
you try and pin me and i try and pin you
thats the whole game
with one clean move charlie flips barton onto his back his head and shoulders hitting with a thump
charlie pins bartons shoulders with his own upper body
but before the move even seems completed charlie is standing again offering his hand down to barton
damn there i go again
were gonna wake the downstairs neighbors
i didnt hurt ya did i
barton seems dazed but not put out
its okay its okay
well thats all that wrestling is
except usually theres more grunting and squirming before the pin
well its your first time
and youre out of your weight class
barton has propped himself up and is painfully massaging the back of his head
this registers on charlie
jesus i did hurt you
he clomps hurriedly away
im just a big clumsy lug
i sure do apologize
we hear water running and charlie reenters with a wet towel
barton accepts the towel and presses it to his head
you sure youre okay
barton gets to his feet
im fine charlie
really i am
actually its been helpful but i guess i should get back to work
charlie looks at him with some concern then turns and heads for the door
well it wasnt fair of me to do that
im pretty well endowed physically
he opens the door
dont feel bad though
i wouldnt be much of a match for you at mental gymnastics
gimme a holler if you need anything
the door closes
barton crosses to the secretary and sits down rubbing the back of his head
he rolls up the carriage and looks at the page in the typewriter
on manhattans lower east side
early morning traffic is audible as is the cry fishmongers
he rubs the back of his head wincing as he stares at the page
his gaze drifts up
the bathing beauty
looking at the picture
he presses the heels of his hands against his ears
the bathing beauty
faint but building is the sound of the surf
the surf is mixing into another liquid sound
barton looks sharply around
the sink which charlie apparently left running when he wet bartons towel is overflowing
water spills onto the tile floor
barton hurriedly shuts off the tap rolls up one sleeve and reaches into the sink
as his hand emerges holding something we hear the unclogged sink gulp water
holding a dripping wad of cotton
after a brief puzzled look he realizes where the cotton came from and convulsively flips it away
mayhew a hand enters with pen to inscribe to barton may this little entertainment divert you in your sojourn among the philistines
bill the book is closed and picked up
the heavy volume is deposited across the table in front of barton by mayhew
barton mayhew and audrey are seated around a picnic table
it is one of a few tables littering the lot of a small stucco open air hamburger stand
it is peaceful early evening
the last of the sunlight slopes down through palm trees
barton mayhew and audrey are the only customers at the stand
mayhews black ford stands alone at the edge of the lot
mayhew leans back in his chair
if i close meyes i can almost smell the live oak
thats hamburger grease bill
well molfactorys turnin womanish on me lyin and deceitful
his eyes still closed he waves a limp hand gently in the breeze
still i must say
i havent felt peace like this since the grand productive days
dont you find it so barton
aint writin peace
actually no bill
barton looks nervously at audrey before continuing
no ive always found that writing comes from a great inner pain
maybe its a pain that comes from a realization that one must do something for ones fellow man to help somehow to ease his suffering
maybe its a personal pain
at any rate i dont believe good work is possible without it
wal me i just enjoy maikn things up
its when i cant write cant escape mself that i want to tear mhead off and run screamin down the street with mballs in a fruitpickers pail
he sighs and reaches for a bottle of wild turkey
thisll sometimes help
that doesnt help anything bill
thats true bill
ive never found it to help my writing
mayhew is becoming testy your writing
son have you ever heard the story of solomans mammy audrey anticipating jumps hastily in
she taps the book on the table
you should read this barton
i think its bills finest or among his finest anyway
mayhew looks at her narrowly
so now im sposed to roll over like an ol bitch dog gettin ger belly scratched
bill look maybe its none of my business but a man with your talent dont you think your first obligation would be to your gift
shouldnt you be doing whatever you have to do to work again
and what would that be son
i dont know exactly
but i do know what youre doing with that drink
youre cutting yourself off from your gift and from me and audrey and from your fellow man and from everything your art is about
no son thisahere moonshines got nothin to do with shuttin folks out
no im usin it to build somethin
im buildin a levee
gulp by gulp brick by brick
raisin up a levee to keep that ragin river of manure from lappin at mdoor
maybe you better too barton
before you get buried under his manure
mhoney pretends to be impatient with me barton but shell put up with anything
not anything bill
dont test me
youre lucky she puts up with as much as she does
mayhew is getting to his feet
maybe to a schoolboys eye
people who know about the human heart though mebbe theyd say bill over here he gives his honey love and she pays him back with pity the basest coin there
stop it bill
he wanders over to a corner of the lot between two palm trees still clutching his bottle his back to barton and audrey and urinates into the grass
he is singing loudly old black joe
audrey walks over to him
watching her go
audrey touches mayhews elbow
he looks at her stops singing she murmurs something and he bellows the truth mhoney is a tart that does not bear scrutiny
she touches him again murmuring and he lashes out at her knocking her to the ground
breach my levee at your peril
coming back to barton
stumbling off down the dusty road muttering to himself and waving his bottle of wild turkey
let him go
that son of a bitch
dont get me wrong hes a fine writer
he looks down the road
mayhew is a small lone figure weaving in the dust
ill jus walk on down to the pacific and from there ill
are you all right
we hear distant bellowing silent upon a hill in darien
audrey bursts into tears
barton puts his arms around her and she leans into him
audrey you cant put up with this
gradually she collects herself wiping her tears
oh barton i feel so
sorry for him
hes a son of a bitch
no sometimes he just
well he thinks about estelle
his wife still lives in fayettesville
he considers this for a moment but his anger returns
well that doesnt excuse his behavior
hell wander back when hes sober and apologize
he always does
okay but that doesnt excuse his barton
what dont i understand
audrey gazes at him
he is very distant now weaving but somehow dignified in his light summer suit
old black joe floats back to us in the twilight
from a high angle booming down on barton
the room is dark
barton lies fully clothed stretched out on the bed asleep
the hum of the mosquito fades up in the stillness
suddenly barton slaps his cheek
his eyes open but he remains still
the hum fades up again
barton reaches over and turns on the bedside lamp
his eyes shift this way and that as he waits listening
the hum fades down to silence
bartons eyes shift
the typewriter sits on the secretary a piece of paper rolled halfway through the carriage
barton enters frame and sits down in front of the typewriter
next to the typewriter are several crumpled pieces of paper
the page in the carriage reads on the lower east side
we can faintly hear the cry of the fishmongers
it is too early for us to hear traffic later perhaps we will
looking down at the page
swinging in the legwell
one foot idly swings over to nudge a pair of nicely shined shoes from where they rest under the secretary into the legwell
we hear typing start
a new paragraph being started a large man
as he slides them into the shoes
a large man in tights
the typing stops
looking quizzically at the page
sliding back and forth swimming in his shoes which are several sizes too large
we hear a knock at the door
he rises and answers the door
charlie stands smiling in the doorway holding a pair of nicely shined shoes
i hope these are your shoes
because that would mean they gave you mine
yeah as a matter of fact they did
come on in
the two stocking footed men go into the room and barton reaches under the secretary for charlies shoes
jesus what a day ive had
ever had one of those days
seems like nothing but lately
chalrie perches on the edge of the bed
jesus what a day
felt like i couldntve sold ice water in the sahara
okay so you dont want insurance so okay thats your loss
but god people can be rude
feel like i have to talk to a normal person like just to restore a little of my
well my pleasure
i could use a little lift myself
a little lift yeah
smiling he takes out his flask
good thing they bottle it huh pal
he takes a glass from the bedstand and as he pours barton a shot did i say rude
people can be goddamn cruel
especially some of their housewives
okay so ive got a weight problem
thats my cross to bear
its a defense mechanism
defense against what
something they need
something they should be thanking me for offering
a little peace of mind
he shakes his head
finally decided to knock off early take your advice
went to see a doctor about this
he indicates his ear still stuffed with cotton
he told me it was an ear infection
ten dollars please
i said hell i told you my ear was infected
why dont you give me ten dollars
well that led to an argument
he gives a rueful chuckle
listen to me belly achin
as if my problems amounted to a hill of beans
how goes the life of the mind
well its been better
i cant seem to get going on this thing
that one idea the one that lets you get started i still havent gotten it
maybe i only had one idea in me my play
maybe once that was done i was done being a writer
christ i feel like a fraud sitting here staring at this paper
those two love birds next door drivin you nuts
barton looks at him curiously
how did you know about that
know about it
i can practically see how theyre doin it
brother i wish i had a piece of that
yeah but seems like i hear everything that goes on in this dump
pipes or somethin
im just glad i dont have to ply my trade in the wee wee hours
ah youll lick this picture business believe me
youve got a head on your shoulders
what is it they say
where theres a head theres a hope
where theres life theres hope
that proves you really are a writer
and theres hope for you too charlie
tomorrow i bet you sell a half dozen policies
but the fact is i gotta pull up stakes temporarily
in a few days
out to your stompin grounds as a matter of fact new york city
things have gotten all balled up at the head office
im truly sorry to hear that charlie
ill miss you
well hell buddy dont pull a long face
this is still home for me i keep my room and ill be back sooner or later
barton rises and walks over to his writing table
and mark my words by the time i get back youre picturell be finished
i know it
barton scribbles on a notepad and turns to hand it to charlie
new york can be pretty cruel to strangers charlie
if you need a home cooked meal you just look up morris and lillian fink
they live on fulton street with my uncle dave
we hear a tacky tearing sound
barton looks toward the door
charlie rises and walks over to the stand next to where barton sits
the two staring men form an odd motionless tableau the slight bespectacled man seated the big man standing in a hunch with his hands on his thighs their heads close
a swath of wallpaper in the entryway has pulled away from the wall
it sags and nods
your room does that too
i guess the heats sweating off the wallpaper
what a dump
he heads for the door and barton follows
i guess it seems pathetic to a guy like you
well its pathetic isnt it
i mean to a guy from new york
what do you mean
this kind of heat
well i guess you pick your poison
so they say
dont pick up and leave without saying goodbye
course not compadre
youll see me again
barton closes the door
he goes back to the desk sits and stares at the typewriter
after a beat he tips back in his chair and looks up at the ceiling
we hear a loud thump
the ceiling a white seamless space
as we track in the thumping continues slowly rhythmically progressively louder the effect it seems of odd doings upstairs
from a high angle tipped back in his chair staring at the ceiling
we track slowly down toward him
the thumping continues growing louder sharper
moving in on the ceiling
we close in on an unblemished area and cease to have any sense of movement
with a blur something huge and dark sweeps across the frame to land with a deafening crash and an instant later it is gone having left a huge black t
stamped into the white ceiling
we are pulling back from the white past the metal prongs of the key strike area on a typewriter
more letters appear rapid fire growing smaller as the pull back continues
the thumpimg becomes the clacking of the typewriter
is emerging from his office
as he enters the secretary stops typing glances down at a slip of paper and murmurs tonelessly without looking up barton fink
the clack of the typewriter resumes as barton rises
the two men enter
this office is considerably smaller than lipniks done in grays and black
there are pictures on the wall of geisler with various celebrities
geisler sits behind his desk
wuddya got for me what the hell happened to your face
its just a mosquito bite
like hell it is there are no mosquitos in los angeles
mosquitos breed in swamps this is a desert town
wuddya got for me
on the beery picture
where are we
well to tell you the truth im having some trouble getting started getting started
you mean you dont have anything
well not much
geisler leaps to his feet and paces
what do you think this is
its a goddamn b picture
big men in tights
you know the drill
im afraid i dont really understand that genre
maybe thats the prob understand shit
i though you were gonna consult another writer on this
well ive talked to bill mayhew bill mayhew
the guys a souse
hes a great writer a souse
you dont understand
hes in pain because he cant write souse
he manages to write his name on the back of his paycheck every week
i thought no one cared about this picture
whered you get that from
i dont know what the hell you said to lipnik but the sonofabitch likes you
you understand that fink
he likes you
hes taken an interest
never make lipnik like you
some puzzlement shows through bartons weariness
i dont understand are you deaf he likes you
hes taken an interest
what the hell did you say to him
i didnt say anything well hes taken an interest
that means hell make your life hell which i could care less about but since i drew the short straw to supervise this turkey hes gonna be all over me
fat assed sonofabitch called me yesterday to ask how its going dont worry i covered for you
told him you were making progress and we were all very excited
i told him it was great so now my ass is on the line
he wants you to tell him all about it tomorrow
i cant write anything by tomorrow
who said write
jesus jack cant read
you gotta tell it to him tell him something for chrissake
well what do i tell him
geisler rubs a temple studies barton for a beat then picks up a telephone
as he waits geisler gives barton a withering stare
it continues throughout the phone conversation
ben geisler here
any of the screening rooms free this afternoon
good book it for me
a writer named fink is gonna come in and youre gonna show him wrestling pictures
i dont give a shit which ones
wait a minute isnt victor sjoderberg shooting one now

he slams down the phone
this ought to give you some ideas
he jots an address on a piece of paper and hands it to barton
eight fifteen tomorrow morning at lipniks house
dont cross me fink
black and white footage
a middle aged man with a clapstick enters and shouts devil on the canvas twelve baker take one
the clapper withdraws
the angle is on a corner of the ring where an old corner man stands behind his charge a huge man in tights who is a little too flabby to
be a real athlete
his hair is plastered against his bullet skull and he has a small mustache
the wrestler rises from his stool and heads toward center ring and the camera
he affects a german accent i will destroy him
he passes the camera
the clapper enters again
twelve baker take two
the wrestler moves toward the camera
i will destroy him
the clapper enters twelve baker take three
i will destroy him
seated alone in a dark screening room the shaft of the projection beam flickering over his left shoulder
as we creep in closer off i will destroy him
i will destroy him
i will destroy him
i will destroy him
another off microphone distant voice from the screen okay take five
a jerky pan interrupted by flash frames
the wrestler is standing in a corner joking with a makeup girl who pats down his face as he smokes a cigarette
a cut in the film and another clapstick enters
twelve charlie take one staring at the screen dull wan and forlorn
the angle is low canvas level
we hold for a brief moment on the empty canvas before two wrestlers crash down into frame
the german is underneath on his back pinned by the other man
the referee enters cropped at the knees and throws counting fingers down into frame
the german bucks and throws his opponent out of frame
twelve charlie take two
off the screaming drops out abruptly at cut
we hear only the sound of heavy footfalls on carpet
below the opening paragraph two new words have been added to the typescript orphan
the foot falls continue
barton paces frantically back and forth
he looks at his watch
it is lifted out of the cradle
hello chet its barton fink in
can you try a number for me in hollywood
we pull back to frame in barton as we hear his call ring through
pick it up
pick it up
pick it hello
audrey listen i need help
i know its late and i shouldnt be calling you like this believe me i wouldnt have if i could see any other alternative but i im sorry listen how
are you im sorry
you doing okay
who is this
im sorry its barton fink
through the phone in the background we hear mayhews drunken bellowing
sons of bitches
drown em all
we hear various objects dropping or being thrown to the floor
barton im afraid its not a good time drown all those rascals
im sorry i just feel like i know i shouldnt ask i just need some kind of help i just i have a deadline tomorrow i said drown em all
who is that
there is more clatter
audreys voice is hushed close to the phone all right barton ill see if i can slip away who is that
gaddamn voices come into the house
sons of bitches
if you could id if i can
he gets jealous he goddamn voices
i need help audrey
ill try to slip out
if he quiets down passes out
im afraid he thinks well he said you were a buffoon barton
he becomes irrational hesh up
be still now
it is quiet
we are craning down toward the bed where barton lies stretched out his head buried beneath a pillow as if to blot out the world
the track reveals the wristwatch on bartons dangled arm
at the end of the dimly lit corridor a red light blinks on over the elevator with a faint bell
with two violent and simultaneous motions he whips the pillow off his head and throws out his other wrist to look at his watch
there is a knock at the door
barton swings his feet off the bed
barton opens the door to audrey
audrey thank you for coming
im sorry to be such a
they enter the main room where audrey perches on the edge of the bed
now thats all right barton
everythingll be all right
he drifted off
hell sleep for a while now
what is it you have to do exactly
well i have to come up with an outline id guess you call it
the whole goddamn story
soup to nuts
the whole goddamn its alright barton
you dont have to write actual scenes
no but the whole goddamn audrey
have you ever had to read any of bills wrestling scenarios
yes im afraid i have
what are they like
what are they about
well usually theyre
simply morality tales
theres a good wrestler and a bad wrestler whom he confronts at the end
in between the good wrestler has a love interest or a child he has to protect
bill would usually make the good wrestler a backwoods type or a convict
and sometimes instead of a waif hed have the wrestler protecting an idiot manchild
the studio always hated that
oh some of the scripts were so
she laughs then stops realizing that she has laughed
she looks at barton
she shakes her head
look its really just a formula
you dont have to type your soul into it
well invent some names and a new setting
ill help you and it wont take any time at all
i did it for bill so many times bartons pacing comes up short
did what for bill
you wrote his scripts for him
well the basic ideas were frequently his you wrote bills scripts
jesus christ you wrote his what about before that
before bill came to hollywood
audrey is clearly reluctant to travel this path
well bill was always the author so to speak what do you mean so to speak
audrey how long have you been his
barton i think we should concentrate on our little project i want to know how many of bills books you wrote
i want to know
barton honestly only the last couple hah
and my input was mostly
editorial really when hed been drinking ill bet
jesus the grand productive days
what a goddamn phony
he resumes pacing
william goddamn phony mayhew
all his guff about escape
ill say he escaped
barton sighs and looks at his watch
well we dont have much time
he sits down next to audrey
audreys tone is gentle
itll be fine
dont judge him barton
dont condescend to him
she strokes bartons hair
its not as simple as you think
i helped bill most by appreciating him by understanding him
we all need understanding barton
even you tonight its all you really need
she kisses him
as barton tentatively responds we are panning away
we frame up on the door to the bathroom and track in toward the sink
we can hear the creak of bedsprings and audrey and bartons breath becoming labored
the continuing track brings us up to and over the lid of the sink to frame up its drain a perfect black circle in the porcelain white
we track up to the drain and are enveloped by it as the sound of lovemaking mixes into the groaning of pipes
the hum of a mosquito brings us out of the black and we are looking down at barton in bed asleep
it is dawn
bartons eyes snap open
the white ceiling
a humming black speck flits across the white
slowly cautiously he props himself up his look following the sound of the mosquito
his gaze travels down and to one side and is arrested as the hum stops
audrey lies facing away on her side of the bed half covered by a blanket
gingerly he reaches over and draws the blanket down audreys back
the alabaster white of audreys back
the mosquito is feeding on it
swelling with blood
as bartons hand comes through frame and slaps audreys back
she doesnt react
barton draws his hand away
audreys back is smeared with blood
he looks at his hand
his hand is dripping with blood
too much blood
eyes wide he looks down at the bed
blood seeps up into the sheet beneath the curve of audreys back
he pulls audreys shoulder
she rolls onto her back
her eyes are wide and lifeless
her stomach is nothing but blood
the top sheet drawn to her waist is drenched red and clings to her body
he screams again
we hear rapid and heavy footfalls next door a door opening and closing and then a loud banging on bartons door
bartons head spins towards the door
he is momentarily frozen
barton leaps to his feet and hurries to the door
over bartons shoulder as he cracks the door
charlie stands in the hall in his boxer shorts and a sleeveless tee
are you all right
barton stares dumbly for a moment
can i come in
are you sure no
barton is nodding as he shuts the door in charlies face
he walks back into the room
audreys corpse in long shot face up on the bed
he walks toward the bed wheels before he reaches it and starts back toward the door
he stops short and turns back again to the room
he averts his eyes as it happens toward the secretary
he walks stiffly over and sits his back to audrey
as he sits in
he stares emptily down at the desk in shock totally shut down
behind him we can see audrey on the bed
he stares for a long beat
strange involuntary noises come from his throat
he is not in control
becoming aware of the noise he is making he stops
he lurches to his feet
as barton enters opens the door and sticks his head out
barton peers out the see if the coast is clear
the long hallway
in the deep background chet the night clerk is stooping in front of a door to pick up a pair of shoes
next to him is a castored shoe caddy
all of the doorways between us and chet are empty of shoes
close on him as mid stoop he looks up
up the long hall
in the deep background a door is closing
he pauses then straightens up and puts the shoes on the shoe caddy
it squeaks as he pushes it on down the hall
barton stands at the door listening to a very faint squeak
eventually it becomes inaudible
he cracks the door again looks out and exits
barton goes to charlies room and knocks
footfalls end as the door is cracked open
are you all right
can i come in
why dont we go to your room charlie im in trouble
youve gotta help me
once again he is breathing hard
charlie steps out into the hall and shuts the door behind him
get a grip on yourself brother
whatever the problem is well sort it out
charlie im in trouble something horribles happened ive gotta call the police
charlie leads him towards his room
will you stay with me till they get here
dont worry about it barton
we can sort it he is pushing bartons door open but barton grabs an elbow to stop him
before you go in i didnt do this
i dont know how it happened but i didnt
i want you to know that
charlie looks into his eyes
for a moment the two men stare at each other charlies look inquisitive bartons supplicating
finally charlie nods
he turns and pushes open the door
the two men enter
barton lingers by the door
charlie walks into the foreground to look off toward the bed
his eyes widen and he screams
he turns and disappears into the bathroom
we hear vomiting then the flush of a toilet
jesus have mercy
his reaction has not encouraged barton who is more and more agitated
charlie emerges from the bathroom sweating
jesus barton what the hell is this
whatre we gonna do
ive gotta call the police or you could call for me hold on you gotta believe me hold on i didnt do this i did not do this hold on
take a deep breath
tell me what happened
i dont know

god you gotta believe me
charlie in spite of himself is sneaking horrified glances back into the room
i believe you brother but this dont look good
we gotta call the police hold on
i said hold on so hold on
what do you think happened
i dont know
maybe it was her
i passed out
i dont know
wont the police be able to stop with the police
wake up friend
this does not look good
they hang people for this
but i didnt do it dont you believe me
i believe you i know you
but why should the police
barton gives him a dumb stare
barton between you and me did you have sexual intercourse
barton stares at charlie
charlie shakes his head
they can tell that
they gotta believe me charlie
they gotta have mercy
youre in pictures barton
even if you got cleared eventually this would ruin you
he turns and starts toward the bed
wait in the bathroom
barton still in his underwear sits leaning against the wall staring glassily at his feet
from the other room we hear the creak of bedsprings and the sounds of bed clothes being torn off
finally there is a last creak of bedsprings and the sound of charlie grunting under great weight
we hear heavy footsteps approaching
barton looks up through the open bathroom door
charlie is groping for the front doorknob cradling the sheetswaddled body in his arms
his neck goes rubbery
his eyes roll up
his head lolls back to hit the wall
we are low on charlie who is following through on a slap and backing away having aroused barton
charlie is now wearing pants but is still in his sleeveless tee which has blood flecks across the belly
you passed out
barton looks groggily up
shes dead barton
if that was her name
he stares at charlie
off barton listen to me
you gotta act like nothings happened
put this totally out of your head
i know thats hard but your play from here on out is just to go about business as usual
give us some time to sort this out
barton looks at his watch
off just put it out of you head
toward a pool set in a grand yard with shaped hedges and statuary set amid palms trees
sunlight glitters angrily off the water we are approaching jack lipnik who sits poolside in a white deck chair
so happy to see ya
pulling barton who is being escorted by lou breeze
barton is haggard sunken eyes squinting against too much sun
relax for a minute then talk
as barton sits yeah
work hard play hard
thats what i hear anyway
he laughs then barks at lou breeze
ben geisler tells me thingsre going along great
thinks weve got a real winner in this one
and let me tell you something im counting on it
ive taken an interest
not to interfere mind you hardly seems necessary in your case
a writer a storyteller of your stature
givitta me in bold strokes bart
gimme the broad outlines
im sitting in the audience the lights go down capitol logo comes up
he beams expectantly at barton
barton licks his parched lips
we fade in
lipnik is nodding already involved in the story
its a tenement building
on the lower east side
hes poor this wrestler
hes had to struggle
barton looks back out at the pool his eyes closed to slits against the sun
he looks back at lipnik
can i be honest mr
you damn well better be
jesus if i hadnt been honest in my business dealings well of course you cant always be honest not with the sharks swimming around this town but if youre a
writer you dont think about those things if id been totally honest i wouldnt be within a mile of this pool unless i was cleaning it
but thats no reason for you not to be
honest i mean
not cleaning the pool
lou has entered with a drink which he sets next to barton
barton looks around takes the drink sips at it greedily but must finally take the plunge
to be honest im never really comfortable discussing a work in progress
ive got it all worked out in my head but sometimes if you force it out in words prematurely the wrong words well your meaning changes and it changes your
own mind and you never get it back so id just as soon not talk about it
lipnik stares at him
his smile has disappeared
there is a long beat
lou breeze clears his throat
he apparently feels obliged to fill the silence
never mind me
never mind how long ive been in pictures
lipnik has been in pictures just about since they were invented
he practically invented them
lipnik has turned to look curiously at lou
now i think if hes interested in what one of his contract employees is doing while he draws pay i think that employee ought to tell him if he wants
to stay an employee
right now the contents of your head are the property of capitol pictures so if i were you i would speak up
and pretty goddamn fast
lou looks at barton expectantly
lipnik continues to stare at lou
there is a long silence terribly heavy
finally lipnik explodes at lou
you lousy sonofabitch
youre telling this man this artist what to do
lou breeze is stunned
lipnik i this man creates for a living
he puts food on your table and on mine
thank him for it
thank him you ungrateful sonofabitch
thank him or youre fired
barton is staring aghast
lipnik thats not really necessar lipnik still staring at lou gives no sign of hearing barton
he rises and points
get down on your knees you sonofabitch
get down on your knees and kiss this mans feet
lipnik please i mr
lipnik lou aghast looks at barton
barton aghast can only return the same stunned look
lipnik snarls at lou okay get out of here
youre fired you understand me
get out of my sight
lou gets stiffly to his feet and stumbles away
lipnik i i apologize barton
no no mr
breeze has actually been a great help you dont have to cover for him
its noble of you but these things happen in business
lipnik i really would feel much better if you could reconsider ah forget it kid
i want you to pull this out of your head
if that sonofabitch wouldnt apologize to you goddammit i will
i respect your artistry and your methods and if you cant fill us in yet well hell we should be kissing your feet for your fine efforts
he gets down on his knees in front of barton
you know in the old country we were taught as very young children that theres no shame in supplicatin yourself when you respect someone
barton stares horrified at lipnik on the ground at his feet
on behalf of capitol pictures the administration and all a the stockholders please accept this as a symbol of our apology and respect
lipnik kisses his shoe and looks up at him
behind lipnik the pool glitters
the cut has a hard musical sting
out of the sting comes a loud but distorted thumping noise
we are looking down high angle form one corner of the room
we are presented with a motionless tableau barton sits hunched in the far corner elbows on knees staring at the bed in front of him
he wears only trousers and a t shirt and his body and face glisten with sweat
the beds sheets have been stripped and the ratty gray mattress has an enormous rust red stain in the middle
after a beat in the foreground the only motion in the scene a bead of tacky yellow wall sweat dribbles down the near wall
silence then the thumping repeats resolving itself to a knock at the door
barton rises slowly and crosses to the door
barton opens it to charlie who is dressed in a baggy suit his hair slicked back a tan fedora pushed back on his head
it is the first time we have seen him well turned out
a battered briefcase is on the floor next to him
he holds a parcel in his left hand about one foot square wrapped in brown paper and tied up with twine
can i come in
barton stands back from the door and charlie picks up his briefcase and enters
as the two men enter
have to old timer
just for a while
barton sounds desperate jesus charlie i
everythings okay believe me
i know its rough mentally but everythings taken care of
ive got no one else here
youre the only person i know in los angeles
he starts weeping that i can talk to
charlie also disturbed and unhappy wraps both arms around barton
barton sobs unashamedly into his shoulder
charlie is somber
charlie i feel like im going crazy like im losing my mind
i dont know what to do
i didnt do it believe me
im sure of that charlie
his breath comes in short gasping heaves
i just dont know what
to do you gotta get a grip on brother
you gotta just carry on just for a few days till i get back
try and stay here keep your door locked
dont talk to anyone
we just gotta keep our heads and well figure it out
yeah but charlie dammit dont argue with me
you asked me to believe you well i do
now dont argue with me
he looks at barton for a beat
look pal can you do something for me
charlie hands him his parcel
keep this for me till i get back
barton snuffling accepts the package
its just personal stuff
i dont wanna drag it with me but i dont trust em downstairs and id like to think its in good hands
still snuffling sure charlie
funny huh when everything thats important to a guy everything he wants to keep from a lifetime when he can fit it into a little box like that
i guess its kind of pathetic
wallowing in self pity its more than ive got
well keep it for me
maybe itll bring you good luck
yeah itll help you finish your script
youll think about me
he thumps his chest
make me your wrestler
then youll lick that story of yours
barton is tearfully sincere thanks charlie
charlie solemnly thrusts out his hand
yeah well see you soon friend
youre gonna be fine
as they walk to the door youll be back
dont worry about that compadre
ill be back
barton shuts the door behind charlie locks it and turns around
the blood stained mattress
barton walks across the room and sits carefully at the edge of the bed avoiding the rust colored stain
for a long beat he sits still but something is building inside
finally when we hear the distant ding of the elevator arriving for charlie it erupts barton sobs with the unself conscious grief of an abandoned child
barton weeping alone on the bed next to the rust colored stain
with the fade in the sound of the surf mixes up
we pan down the picture to discover that a snapshot has been tucked into a corner of the picture frame it is the snap of charlie smiling and waving with
his foot up on the running board of the ford roadster
sitting at the desk staring at the picture
from his glazed eyes and the way his mouth hangs open we may assume he has been staring at the picture for some time
he notices something on the desk and picks it up
the holy bible placed by the gideons
barton opens it randomly to the book of daniel
the text is set in ornately gothic type
and the king nebuchadnezzar answered and said to the chaldeans i recall not my dream if ye will not make known unto me my dream and its interpretation ye shall
be cut in pieces and of your tents shall be made a dunghill
staring at the passage
his mouth hangs open
barton riffles to the first page
in bold type at the top underneath in the same ornately gothic type chapter one
fade in on a tenement building on manhattans lower east side
faint traffic noise is audible
as is the cry of fishmongers
squinting at the page through bloodshot eyes
his mouth hangs open
at the cut the harsh clackety clack of typing bangs in
sunlight burns against the sheers of bartons window making it a painfully bright patch in the room which itself remains fairly dim
barton sits at the secretary typing furiously
he finishes a page yanks it out of the carriage and places it face down on a short stack of face down pages
he feeds in a blank sheet and resumes his rapid typing
he is sweating unshaven and more haggard even than when we left him the previous night
the telephone rings
after several rings barton stops typing and answers it absently still looking at his work
his voice is hoarse
he puts the receiver down on the desk leans over the typewriter and examines something he has just written
he picks the phone back up and listens for a beat
no dont send them up here
ill be right down
a small oscillating fan whirs up in a corner of the elevator
we pan down to barton who is riding down with pete the old elevator operator
bartons voice is hoarse with fatigue
you read the bible pete
i think so
anyway ive heard about it
they ride for a beat
late afternoon sun slants in from one side
the lobby has the same golden ambiance as when first we saw it
barton is walking toward two wing chairs in the shadows from which two men in suits are rising
one is tall the other short
all three sit in ancient maroon swing chairs
mastrionotti perches on the edge of his chair deutsch slumps back in the shadows studying barton
got a couple questions to ask ya
what do you do fink
still hoarse i write
what kind of write
well as a matter of fact i write for the pictures

how long you been up there fink

he is holding a small black and white photograph out toward barton
there is a long beat as barton studies the picture
he lives next door to me
thats right fink he lives next door to you

once or twice
his name is charlie meadows
yeah and im buck rogers

deutsch indicates mastrionotti
yeah and hes buck rogers
no reputable company would hire a guy like that
well thats what he said
im trying to think
he said he liked jack oakie pictures
mastrionotti looks at deutsch
deutsch looks at mastrionotti
after a beat mastrionotti looks back at barton
ya know fink ordinarily we say anything you might remember could be helpful
but ill be frank with you that is not helpful
ya see how hes not writing it down
thats a jewish name isnt it
mastrionotti gets to his feet looking around the lobby
yeah i didnt think this dump was restricted
he digs in his pocket
mundt has disappeared
i dont think hell be back
he hands barton a card
give me a call if you see him
or if you remember something that isnt totally idiotic
we are tracking toward the paper wrapped parcel that sits on the nightstand next to bartons bed
barton enters and picks it up
he holds it for a beat looking at it then brings it over to the secretary and sits
he shakes it
no sound whatever is inside is well packed
barton holds it up to his ear and listens for a long beat as if it were a seashell and he is listening for the surf
finally he puts it on his desk beneath the picture of the bathing beauty and starts typing quickly and steadily
some time later barton still types
he is face to us beyond him we can see the bed with its rust colored stain
the phone rings
barton ignores it
it continues to ring
barton rises and exits frame we hold on to the bed in the background
we hear bartons footsteps on the bathroom tile as the phone continues ringing
barton sits back into frame stuffing cotton into each ear
he resumes typing
the desk trembles under the working of the typewriter
charlies parcel chatters
barton takes a finished page out of the carriage and places it face down on the growing stack to his right
he feeds in a new page
we hear the muted ding of the elevator down the hall
barton resumes typing
we hear a knock on bartons door
barton does not react apparently not hearing
we are close on the bottom of the door
someone in the hallway is sliding a note beneath the door then his shadow disappears and his footsteps recede
the note is a printed message headed while you were out
underneath are the printed words you were called by and handwritten in the space following mr
handwritten below in the message space thank you
lipnik loved your meeting
keep up the good work
bartons offscreen typing continues steadily
a perfectly symmetrical wide low angle shot of the empty hall
shoes are set put in front of each door except for one in the middle background
at the cut in we hear faint regular typing
we hold for a beat
there is no motion
the long empty hall
the distant typing
the typing stops
there is a beat of quiet
it is broken by the sound of a door opening
it is the shoeless door in the middle background
a hand reaches out to place a pair of shoes in the doorway
the hand withdraws
the door closes
a short beat of silence
the distant typing resumes
the long empty hall
the distant typing
we hear the distant sound of a womans voice tinny and indistinct
just a minute and ill connect you
his eyes are red rimmed and wild
he sits on the edge of his bed holding the phone to his ear
his voice is unnaturally loud hello
he stops reaches up takes a cotton wad out of his ear
we hear various clicks and clacks as the telephone lines switch and then a distant ring
the phone rings three or four times before it is answered by a groggy voice
garland its me
what time is it
are you all right
yeah im fine garland i have to talk to you
im calling long distance
muffled we hear garland speaking to someone else
calling long distance
back into the receiver what is it barton
are you okay
im fine garland but i have to talk with you
go ahead son

i think its really big
what do you mean barton

i just thought you should know that
have you read the bible garland
barton is everything okay
well im just asking
you sound a little guardedly sound a little what
well you just
sound a little bitterly thanks garland
thanks for all the encouragement
he slams down the phone
a one quarter shot on barton from behind as he picks up the cotton wad and sticks it back in his right ear
he resumes typing furiously
after a beat he mutters still typing
we hear typing and the roar of the surf
we are extremely close on the key strike area
as we cut in barton is typing p o s t c a r d
the carriage returns a couple of times and t h ee n d is typed in
the paper is ripped out of the carriage
lying face down on the desk the last page is added face down to the pile
the pile is picked up its edges are straightened with a couple of thumps against the desktop and then the pile is replaced on the desk face up
the title page reads motion picture scenario by barton fink bartons right hand enters frame to deposit a small cotton wad on top of the script
bartons left hand enters to deposit another small cotton wad on top of the script
we hear barton walk away
we hear bath water run
still looking out to sea
we are booming down to the dance floor as a raucous band plays an up tempo number
dancing animatedly almost maniacally his fingers jabbing the air
the hall is crowded but barton is one of few men not in uniform
giggling dancing opposite barton
caught up in his dancing oblivious to the girl
a white uniformed arm reaches in to tap barton on the shoulder
scuse me buddy mind if i cut in
barton glares at him
this is my dance sailor
cmon buddy im shipping out tomorrow
for some reason barton is angry
im a writer
celebrating the completion of something good
do you understand that sailor
im a his bellowing has drawn onlookers attention
step aside four eyes
let someone else spin the dame
give the navy a dance
hey four f take a hike
barton turns furiously against the crowd
im a writer you monsters
he points at his head
this is my uniform
he taps his skull
this is how i serve the common man
this is where i whapp
an infantry man tags bartons chin on the button
the crowd gasps
the band blares nightmarishly on
quiet at the cut
after a beat there is a faint ding at the end of the hall and as the elevator door opens we faintly hear this stop six
barton disheveled emerges and stumbles wearily down the hall
he stops in front of his door takes his key out and enters the room
mastrionotti is sitting on the edge of the bed reading bartons manuscript
deutsch stands in front of the desk staring at the bathing beauty
mother what is to become of him
father well be hearing from that crazy wrestler
and i dont mean a postcard
he looks up at barton
i thought you said you were a writer
i dunno duke
i kinda liked it
keep your filthy eyes off that
deutsch turns toward barton and throws a folded newspaper at him
you made morning papers fink
barton opens the paper
a headline reads writer found headless in chavez ravine
the story has two pictures a studio publicity portrait of mayhew and a photograph of the crime scene two plainclothes detectives stare down into a gulley as a uniformed cop
restrains a pair of leashed dogs
second one of your friends to end up dead
you didnt tell us you knew the dame
with a jerk of his thumb mastrionotti indicates the bloodstained bed
sixth floor too high for you fink
give you nose bleeds
barton crosses the room and sits at the foot of the bed staring at the newspaper
just tell me one thing fink whered you put their heads
no kidding bright boy we smelt mundt all over this
was he the idea man
tell us where the heads are maybe theyll go easy on you
only fry you once
barton rubs his temples
could you come back later
my head is killing me
all right forget the heads
wheres mundt fink
he teach you to do it
you two have some sick sex thing
hes a man
youre a sick fuck fink
all right moron youre under arrest
barton seems oblivious to the two men
down the hall we hear the ding of the arriving elevator
mastrionotti cocks his head with a quizzical look
he rises and walks slowly out into the hall
deutsch wathces him go
mastrionotti in the hallway in full shot framed by the door still looking puzzled
deutsch stands and pushes his suit coat back past the gun on his hip revealing a pair of handcuffs on his belt
he unhitches the cuffs and slips one around bartons right wrist and the other around a loop in the wrought iron footboard of the bed
sit tight fink
as deutsch joins mastrionotti
whys it so goddamn hot out here
deutsch looks where mastrionotti is looking
tacky yellow fluid streams down
the walls are pouring sweat
the hallway is quiet
they look at each other
they look down the hall
the elevator stands open at the far end of the empty hall
for a long beat nothing
finally pete the elevator man emerges
at this distance he is a small figure stumbling this way and that his hands presseed against the sides of his head
he turns to face mastrionotti and deutsch and takes a few steps forward still clutching his head
he takes on last step then collapses
as he pitches forward his hands fall away from his head
his head separates from his neck hits the floor and rolls away from his body with a dull irregular trundle sound
wide eyed they look at each other then back down the hall
all is quiet
smoke is beginning to drift into the far end of the hall
we hear a muted rumble
mastrionotti tugs at his tie
he slowly unholsters his gun
deutsch slowly hypnotically follows suit
show yourself mundt
the crack where the floor of the elevator meets that of the hall
it flickers with red light from below
bottom lit smoke sifts up
standing in the foreground gun at ready
sweat pours down his face
behind him deutsch stands nervously in the light spill from bartons doorway
the rumble and crackle of fire grows louder
a swath of wallpaper sags away from the top of the wall exposing glistening lath underneath
with a light airy pop the lathwork catches on fire
its end facing wall slowly spreads flame from where the wallpaper droops
more red bottom lit smoke seeps up from the crack between elevator and hallway floors
with a groan of tension relieved cables and a swaying of the elevator door a pair of feet crosses the threshold into the doorway
wide on the hallway
charlie meadows has emerged from the elevator and is hellishly backlit by the flame
his suit coat hangs open
his hat is pushed back on his head
from his right hand his briefcase dangles
he stands motionless facing us
there is something monumental in his posture shoulders thrown back
behind him deutsch gulps
theres a boy mundt
put the policy case down and your mitts in the air
he leans slowly down to put the briefcase on the floor
he murmurs hes complying
he straightens up from the briefcase a sawed off shotgun in his hands
the shotgun spits fire
mastrionottis face is peppered by buckshot and he is blown back down the hallway into deutsch
bellowing fills the hallway over the roar of the fire the fire starts racing down the hallway
fire races along the wall sweat goopus
his eyes widen at charlie and the approaching fire his gun dangles forgotten from his right hand
charlie is charging down the hallway holding his shotgun loosely in front of his chest in double time position
the fire races along with him
he is bellowing terrified he turns and runs
as he runs down the flaming hallway pursued by flames smoke and karl mundt who also on the run levels his shotgun
his legs and feet spout blood paddle futilely at the air then come down in a twisting wobble like a car on blown tires and pitch him helplessly to the
he slows to a trot and cracks open the shotgun
weeping and dragging himself forward on his elbows
he slows to a walk
barton strains at his handcuffs
through the open doorway we see charlie pass pushing two shells into his shotgun
charlie looms behind him and thwack snaps the shotgun closed
deutsch rolls over to rest on his elbows facing charlie
charlie primes the shotgun clack
he presses both barrels against the bridge of deutshs nose
tightens a finger over both triggers
the gunshot echoes away
barton strains at the handcuffs
we hear charlies footsteps approach slowly heavily
charlie walking down the hall glances in and seems mildly surprised to see barton
the set of his jaw relaxes
his expression softens
he pushes his hat farther back on his head
he shakes is head and whistles
brother is it hot
he walks into the room
as charlie wearily enters
how you been buddy
he props the shotgun in a corner and sits facing barton who stared at him
dont look at me like that neighbor
its just me charlie
i hear its mundt
charlie reaches a flask from his pocket
jesus people can be cruel
he takes a long draught from his flask then gives a haunted stare
if its not my build its my personality
charlie is perspiring heavily
the fire rumbles in the hallway
they say im a madman barton but im not mad at anyone
honest im not
most guys i just feel sorry for
it tears me up inside to think about what theyre going through
how trapped they are
i understand it
i feel for em
so i try and help them out
he reached up to loosen his tie and pop his collar button
i know what it feels like when things get all balled up at the head office
it puts you through hell barton
so i help people out
i just wish someone would do as much for me
he stares miserably down at his feet
jesus its hot
sometimes it gets so hot i wanna crawl right out of my skin
self pity but charlie why me
why because you dont listen
a tacky yellow fluid is dripping from charlies left ear and running down his cheek
jesus im dripping again
he pulls some cotton from his pocket and plugs his ear
cmon barton you think you know about pain
you think i made your life hell
take a look around this dump
youre just a tourist with a typewriter barton
i live here
dont you understand that
his voice is becoming choked
and you come into my home
and you complain that im making too
he looks up at barton
there is a long silence
finally im sorry
wearily dont be
he rises to his feet and kneels in front of barton at the foot of the bed
the two men regard each other
charlie grabs two bars of the footboard frame still staring at barton
his muscles tighten though nothing moves
his neck fans with effort
all of his muscles tense
his face is a reddening grimace
with a shriek of protest the metal gives
the bar to which barton is handcuffed had come loose at the top and barton slides the cuff off it free
charlie gets to his feet
im getting off the merry go round
he takes his shotgun and walks to the door
ill be next door if you need me
a thought stops him at the door and he turns to face barton
behind him the hallway blazes
oh i dropped in on your folks
and uncle dave
barton looks at him dumbly
by the way that package i gave you
it isnt mine
barton rises picks up charlies parcel and his script
as barton emerges
flames lick the walls causing the wallpaper to run with the tack glue sap
smoke fills the hallway
barton looks down the hall
charlie stands in front of the door to his room his briefcase dangling from one hand his other hand fumbling in his pocket for his key
with his hat pushed back on his head and his shoulders slumped with fatigue he could be any drummer returning to any hotel after a long hard day on the
he opens the door and goes into his room
he turns and walks up the hallway his script in one hand the parcel in the other
a horrible moaning sound almost human can be heard under the roar of the fire
we are tracking laterally across the lobby of an executive building
from offscreen we hear fink
morris or lillian fink
eighty five fulton street
filtered through phone i understand that sir or uncle dave
our track has brought barton into frame in the foreground unshaven unkempt bellowing into the telephone
in a hallway in the background a secretary gestures for barton to hurry up
i understand that sir but theres still no answer
shall i check for trouble on the line
barton slams down the phone
barton enters still clinging on to charlies parcel
lou breeze stands in one corner censoriously watching barton
lipnik is at the far end of the room gazing out the window
colonel lipnik if you dont mind
he turns to face barton and we see that he is wearing a smartly pressed uniform with a lot of fruit salad on the chest
barton takes a seat facing lipniks desk
i was commissioned yesterday in the army reserve
henry morgenthau arranged it
hes a dear friend
actually it hasnt officially gone through yet
had wardrobe whip this up
you gotta pull teeth to get anything done in this town
i can understand a little red tape in peacetime but now its all out warfare against the japs
little yellow bastards
theyd love to see me sit this one out
yes sir they anyway i had lou read your script for me
he taps distastefully at the script on his desk which has a slightly charred title page
i gotta tell you fink
it wont wash
with all due respect sir i think its the best work ive done
dont gas me fink
if youre opinion mattered then i guess id resign and let you run the the studio
it doesnt and you wont and the lunatics are not going to run this particular asylum
so lets put a stop to that rumor right now
listlessly yes sir
i had to call beery this morning let him know we were pushing the picture back
after all id told him about quality about that barton fink feeling
how disappointed we were
wally was heartbroken
the man was devastated
he was well i didnt actually call him lou did
but thats a fair description isnt it lou
hell i could take you through it step by step explain why your story stinks but i wont insult your intelligence
well all right first of all this is a wrestling picture the audience wants to see action drama wrestling and plenty of it
they dont wanna see a guy wrestling with his soul well all right a little bit for the critics but you make it the carrot that wags the dog
too much of it and they head for exits and i dont blame em
theres plenty of poetry right inside that ring fink
look at hell ten feet square
blood sweat and canvas
look at blood sweat and canvas
these are big movies fink
about big men in tights both physically and mentally
but especially physically
we dont put wallace beery in some fruity movie about suffering i thought we were together on that
im sorry if i let you down
you didnt let me down
or even lou
we dont live or die by what you scribble fink
you let ben geisler down
he liked you
and thats why hes gone
that guy had a heart as big as the outdoors and you fucked him
he tried to convince me to fire you too but that would be too easy
no youre under contract and youre gonna stay that way
anything you write will be the property of capitol pictures
and capitol pictures will not produce anything you write
not until you grow up a little
you aint no writer fink youre a goddamn write off
i tried to show you something beautiful
something about all of this sets lipnik off you arrogant sonofabitch
you think youre the only writer who can give me that barton fink feeling
i got twenty writers under contract that i can ask for a finktype thing from
you swell headed hypocrite
you just dont get it do you
you think the whole world revolves inside whatever rattles inside that little kike head of yours
get him outta my sight lou
make sure he stays in town though hes still under contract
i want you in town fink and outta my sight
now get lost
theres a war on
crashing against the pacific shore
at midday almost deserted
in the distance we see barton walking
the paper wrapped parcel swings from the twine in his left hand
he walks a few more paces and sits down on the sand looking out to see
his gaze shifts to one side
down the beach a bathing beauty walks along the edge of the water
she looks much like the picture on the wall in bartons hotel room
he stares transfixed at the woman
very beautiful backlit by the sun approaching
following her with his eyes
her eyes meet bartons
she says something but her voice is lost in the crash of the surf
barton cups a hand to his ear
i said its a beautiful day
whats in the box
barton shrugs and shakes his head
i dont know
isnt it yours
i dont know
she nods and sits down on the sand several paces away from him facing the water but looking back over her shoulder at barton
youre very beautiful
are you in pictures
dont be silly
she turns away to look out at the sea
facing the ocean
barton sits in the middle foreground back to us the box in the sand next to him
the bathing beauty sits back to us in the middle background
the surf pounds
the sun sparkles off the water
