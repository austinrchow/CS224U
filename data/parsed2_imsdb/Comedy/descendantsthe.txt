written by alexander payne nat faxon jim rash close on a beautiful year old woman at the helm of a powerful speedboat her hair tossed back by the wind her
mouth in a euphoric grin
my missionary ancestors came to the islands and told the hawaiians to put on clothes work hard believe in christ and stop surfing and hula dancing
they made business deals along the way buying an island or marrying a princess and inheriting her land
now their descendants wear bikinis and running shorts play beach volleyball and surf and take up hula dancing
hawaii has always been a place of contradiction
various shots of honolulu begin a pattern of montages to be interspersed throughout the film
my friends on the mainland think just because i live in hawaii i live in paradise
like a permanent vacation were all just out here drinking mai tais shaking our hips and catching waves
are they nuts
how can they possibly think our families are less screwed up our heart attacks and cancers less fatal our grief less devastating
hell i havent been on a surfboard in fifteen years
we zoom back from a panorama of honolulu to find year old matt king seated amid documents atop a makeshift desk he has brought his work with him
the descendants pink shooting draft draft for the last days ive been living in a paradise of ivs and urine bags and endotracheal tubes and six month old us magazines
paradise can go fuck itself
matt looks up at the woman we saw in the speedboat now lying stiffly on an upright hospital bed her head cocked to one side a feeding tube in her
nose a ventilator in her trachea ivs in her arm
this is elizabeth king my wife
twenty three days ago she was launched from a powerboat during a race and hit her head almost drowned
now shes in a coma that scores on the glasgow scale and on the rancho los amigos scale scores showing an extremely severe coma
liz is very competitive
whatever she does she does to the fullest
matt is getting the current diagnosis
she reacts non purposefully to stimuli in a non specific manner but occasionally her responses are specific though inconsistent
her reflexes are primitive and often the same regardless of stimuli presented
it was exactly what elizabeth used to accuse me of
matt continues to observe her
twenty three days in a coma and any day now the doctors will give me their final verdict if shes going to come out of it or not
then i have a decision to make
wait thats wrong
liz has a living will
the descendants pink shooting draft draft like always she makes her own decisions
but i know shes going to pull through
his cellphone rings
hi noe whats up
matt you have a call from scotties teacher
she says its urgent
put her on
shows photos of elizabeth lying in her hospital bed
the compositions are odd the angles uncomfortably close
matt confers with fifth grade teacher ms
hayashi and school counselor mrs
we just dont think these photographs are appropriate for scottie to be sharing with her classmates
some of them went home quite disturbed and we got some angry calls from parents
yeah shes sort of been going to town with the whole picture taking thing but i had no idea i cant tell you how my heart goes out to you
and your family but scottie just hasnt been herself
principal cruz agrees with us that it maybe would be better for scottie to remain at home with you during this difficult time
see i would think that sticking to her normal routine would be the best thing for her you know keep her occupied
i wouldnt really know how to
the descendants pink shooting draft draft i mean ive kind of got my hands full
and her sisters away at school on the big island
i dont think scottie would really want to hang out with me when she could be with her friends and people like you who specialize in children
king we see this every day children acting out at school when somethings wrong at home
and your family is facing a devastating crisis
have you been engaging scottie in really talking about whats going on
encouraging her to express her feelings
no oh yeah
singing this shit is bananas
b a n a n a s
this shit is bananas
they look over to see earbuds in place and in her own world dancing just outside the classroom door
a janitor down the hall eyes her suspiciously
this shit is bananas
b a n a n a s
matt stares aghast at this specimen called his daughter
the ladies glance between scottie and matt wondering when or whether hell intervene
finally scottie that is not a good choice
are you making a good choice
scottie remains oblivious
hayashi rises to her feet
realizing yeah scottie come on
knock it off
the descendants pink shooting draft draft matt leads scottie to the car
whats the matter with you
showing those pictures of mom for your art project
im a photographer dad a real photographer
no youre not
youre overdoing it is what youre doing
i saw it in a book
some famous photographer lady took pictures of her mom in the hospital while she was dying and theyre considered art
thats what im doing
first of all your mothers very sick but shes not dying
second you dont share personal stuff like that with strangers
whats going on with mom is private
can we get burgers
can we get smoothies
as scottie continues the last time i took care of scottie by myself was when she was one
now shes ten and i have no idea what goes on inside her head
and with elizabeth in the hospital i think shes testing me
im the backup parent
the descendants pink shooting draft draft flash
scottie takes elizabeths picture again
i wish youd stop doing that
and rather than taking her picture all the time you should talk to her
im tired of asking you
you heard dr
johnston people in a coma can hear you you know well some of them can
it lets them know theyre still loved might even help them wake up sooner
and itll help you express whatever feelings and emotions youre supposed to be going through you know make you feel better
i dont know what to say
tell her a story
i dont have a story
tell her anything
tell her whats been going on in school
she never cares about that
i dont believe that
what about after school
shes always driving you around the island
you know gymnastics
i dont do those things anymore
if youre not going to say anything to your mother we might as well leave
the descendants pink shooting draft draft okay
how about this
write her a letter
what would i write
i dont know
i love you
dont leave me alone with my idiot dad
hows she going to read it
shes in a coma
goddammit scottie stop fighting me on everything
but it doesnt make any sense
you know what your mother is hearing right now
you refusing to talk to her
is that what you want
and im thirsty
i want a soda
he takes scottie by the hand and sits her down in a chair next to the bed
were not leaving until you talk to her
ill even give you privacy
recite her the alphabet for all i care
what do you want to drink
do you think im fat
the descendants pink shooting draft draft no youre not fat
im not the model
its just that all that sugar makes you cranky
im not cranky
ill be right back
as matt steps out into the hallway he passes nurse joy
king how are you
fine joy fine
i see your picture in the paper today
have you made your decision yet
about your big land
the other nurse nudges joy to be more polite
me and mr
king were like this
well its not really my decision
its my whole familys decision
mock scolding mind your own business young lady
as he turns away to continue down the hall
the descendants pink shooting draft draft the whole goddamned state is following my decision on whos going to buy acres on kauai my family has owned since the s
my cousins and i meet in six days to approve a buyer
ever since my father died nine years ago im the sole trustee the controlling trustee so i hold all the cards
why does so much have to depend on me my wife my daughters my familys land
i just want to hide
a postcard shows a beautiful young girl in a bikini straddling a surfboard laughing as shes splashed
barely containing his rage matt stares at postcard before grabbing all the postcards in that rack
about to pay for the postcards and two sodas matt notices a headline atop a stack of newspapers activists continue protest of kauai sale
hey they all the same cards
you like buy all the same cards
these are inappropriate for a hospital gift shop
this girl is underage
why do you sell postcards like this
this is a hospital
these arent get well cards
the shopkeeper blinks at the man weirdly accosting her
you like buy all the cards
or you want i put them back
pulling out his wallet never mind
yes im buying them
and these two sodas
as she rings him up
the descendants pink shooting draft draft okay you buy underage girl all for yourself
in the lobby just outside the store he drops the stack of postcards into the garbage
forgoing the elevator perhaps to squeeze in a little exercise matt trudges upstairs
elizabeths going to make it out okay
i know it
its not her time yet
shell wake up scottie and alexandra will have their mother back and well talk about our marriage
ill sell the land and quit my practice and buy her whatever she wants a big boat a house in france a trip around the world just the two of
well get close again like the early days
its still in us
it must be
approaching the door matt hears laughter from inside
matt enters to find scottie on a sofa in the corner giggling and texting
scottie what are you doing
can we go
you didnt talk to her did you
yes i did
what did you tell her
the descendants pink shooting draft draft youre lying
and jesus christ enough with the goddamn texting
give me that phone
give it here
scottie fights him as he snatches her phone away
okay you win
scottie springs up out of the sofa
at least say goodbye
scottie bolts out the door
matt takes a last look at liz panic and sadness rippling across his face
my wife the sportswoman the model the drinker
would you please wake up already
i need you
i cant do this alone
images lead us up the pali highway and into the lush old neighborhood of nuuanu
this stately old house shows signs of neglect but feels impressive and welcoming nonetheless
is this barb higgins
yes it is
hi matt king returning your call
i assume your daughter is a classmate of my daughters
the descendants pink shooting draft draft yes lani is a classmate of scotties yes
as matt speaks on the phone he wanders out of his cluttered home office and into the dining room
how can i help you
lets see where to start
shes been texting some awful things to lani and id like her to stop
heres the latest one
we all know you grew pubes over the summer
she sends little messages like that for no reason
she even wrote it on lanis facebook wall
she calls my daughter lanikai implying shes like the size of an entire neighborhood
do you think thats nice
thats not like her at all
shes usually very sweet
he glances out the window at scottie who sits on the ground back turned pounding something with a big rock
as you may know her mother isnt well and maybe this is how shes dealing with it
i dont care about the backstory mr
my daughter comes home from school in tears
the descendants pink shooting draft draft yeah no i get it
im very sorry
scottie should be the one whos sorry
i want her to come over and apologize to lani and i dont ever want her to write to my daughter again
she can in a good way
if she doesnt apologize im going to tell the headmaster
you cant buy your way out of this
matt draws a long exasperated breath as if everything else werent enough already
see what i mean
everybody sees me as the rich guy the inheritor
people resent us
i resent us
even our last name king
matt drives scottie
you need to say youre sorry and you need to mean it
no dicking around
i have a ton of work to do tonight
do you have any idea how behind i am
you made her cry
why would you want to be so mean to someone
irritated i dont know
is that what you text all the time nasty things
well what then
the descendants pink shooting draft draft i write them with reina
they make her laugh and then she shows megan and brooke and they laugh too
i should have known reina had something to do with it
i dont want you hanging out with her
wait i told reina she could visit me in the hospital since im not in school anymore
well make a deal
you apologize to this girl and you talk to your mother and then well see about reina dropping by the hospital
something outside the window catches scotties attention
matt looks to see walking on the sidewalk with kayaks wearing t shirts reading melnick family reunion
scottie knock it off
scottie sits back in her seat laughing
matt glances in his rearview mirror to see a teenage son taking off his t shirt and throwing it to the ground
the car drives down a block of modest homes
her house is down there on the corner
youve been here before
the descendants pink shooting draft draft yea uh
she invites me to her birthday like every year
so you guys are actually friends
until last years party when she locked me out of the house and i had to sit outside all day while everybody was inside
she thought she was so great but then i became friends with reina and brooke and got popular
barb higgins answers the door
thank you for coming by
as matt and scottie are shown inside they remove their shoes
i forgot to mention the time scottie said she didnt want to be lanis partner at the rock wall because she didnt want to fall into my daughters butt crack
that doesnt even make sense
barb now leads them into where lani higgins sits on a couch
matt is impatient to be done with this meaningless task
scottie do you have something you want to say to lani
the descendants pink shooting draft draft its okay
well nice meeting you both
lani you should come over sometime
come for a swim or a hike or something
scottie the things you said were simply evil
do you realize that
i dont know whats led you to be such a nasty young lady
we came over
were dealing with it
kids are mean sometimes
they grow out of it
its a kid thing
here scottie youre going to stop right
and youre really really sorry right
scottie makes a big exaggerated nod
i dont think shes sorry at all
shes going to keep doing it
i can tell
no she wont
its like the time lani locked scottie out of the house at her birthday party and scottie sat outside by herself
it was a mean thing to do but lani here probably did it just to show off right
lani thinks a moment nods
but im not about to declare that one action defines a human beings entire character
shes a work in progress and like all complex people is a bundle of contradictions
i didnt know about that
you brought me cake
the descendants pink shooting draft draft you brought her cake
so i dont know maybe lani should be the one to apologize since this incident may have been the catalyst for all this
evil was the word you used
the door opens and matt and scottie pause to slip their shoes back on
oh and mr
good luck with the sale
matt turns to look at her
so thats what all this was about on some level
they say your decision will have a major impact on hawaiis real estate world not to mention the whole landscape of kauai
hundreds of millions of dollars yeah
my husbands family is from kauai
hanapepe born and bred
they hope you dont sell
you dont say
all the traffic its going to make
matt and scottie walk away
barb closes the door
are you going to act different with lani
the descendants pink shooting draft draft ill try but its hard
she has a face you just want to hit
the camera makes its way past photos of matts ancestors books of hawaiian history other family memorabilia to find matt at his desk pouring over papers
a clock reads
my great great grandmother was princess margaret kealohilani one of the last direct descendants of king kamehameha
she was originally supposed to marry her hanai brother but she fell in love with her haole banker and estate manager edward king whose parents were missionaries
between his land deals and her huge inheritance all of their descendants for generations have watched the past unfurl millions into our laps through leases and sales
now the rule against perpetuities is forcing us to dissolve the trust and were selling the last parcel of undeveloped land
matt looks up his glance falling on the portraits of edward and margaret
soon my daughters and i can just be normal citizens like everybody else and these dead people will stop controlling our lives
i just want to be a normal guy
establishing tall buildings business people lunch wagons
the descendants pink shooting draft draft matt eats a sack lunch at his desk
his window has a grand view of downtown
we glimpse his punahou college and law school diplomas
unlike a lot of my cousins i havent touched my share of the trust money
like my father before me i live only on the income from my law practice
i dont want my daughters growing up entitled and spoiled
and i agree with my father you give your children enough money to do something but not enough to do nothing
matts secretary noe cracks open his door
king your cousins are here
matt enters the room to find seven cousins waiting to greet him
from their casual clothing and shaggy hair an observer might hardly suspect their status
not only am i the sole but im a commercial real estate and transactional attorney so the most involved of my cousins have been meeting with me regularly to analyze
the bids cousin dave cousin hal cousin six cousin wink cousin lisa cousin connie and cousin stan both of whom oppose the sale entirely
dont be fooled by appearances
in hawaii some of the most powerful people look like bums and stuntmen
matt and his cousins stand above the conference table looking at blueprints and architectural drawings
the proposals are virtually the same hotels shopping centers condos and golf courses
new jobs in the first five years
support letters from the construction industry and unions
the descendants pink shooting draft draft a chicago group is offering half a billion dollars but were leaning toward a lower bid from a guy named don holitzer
hes actually from kauai and made a fortune in silicon valley
cousin hugh is pushing us in that direction and i say why not
close on matt nodding along but highly distracted the sound of lizs ventilator growing louder in his brain
we cut to artists renderings of comatose elizabeth wide closer closer still closer
matt walks inside the front door
matt sits across from old family friend dr
bad news matt
mueller and i we believe her condition which we call a multi factorial anoxic encephalopathy is deteriorating
we see no eye movement no pupillary response basically no brainstem reflexes whatsoever
the machines could keep her going but her quality of life would be
basically what you see now
shell never be like she was matt
we know that now
matt sits very still
i cant tell you how sorry i am to have to tell you this
and you have your daughters
theres just nothing we can do
if we do go ahead and take her off the machines not if matt
i have a legal obligation
you know that
the descendants pink shooting draft draft how long will she last
hard to say
could be a few days
could be two weeks
but for planning purposes you should work off the shortest possible scenario
i know i need to get the ball rolling on organ donations right away
forgot about that one
elizabeth has so many friends a big life
last time i was at your house must have been people
if youre going to let people know to say goodbye which is fairly typical protocol in these situations start now
by the time the last day comes they feel more ready as ready as they can feel
im so sorry matt
his mind spinning matt prepares to look at the corpse to be
when he opens the door and pulls back the curtain he finds friends mark and kai mitchell up for a visit
theyre playing music for elizabeth on a mini boombox and kai is applying make up to lizs face
after cheery greetings whatre you doing
oh shes been looking a little pale lately all cooped up in here and i just know shed be mortified if no one had thought to help her out with
some lipstick and blush
i know shell grill me
matt and mark exchange a look girls
and of course kais getting her all caught up on all the latest gossip
the descendants pink shooting draft draft well i dont want to have to start from scratch later
oh and matt on the way here we stopped by and left some more meals in your fridge all ready to nuke
matt smiles hed been expecting a grim moment alone with elizabeth but instead he finds a room full of warmth and life
even if its a little creepy
so whats the latest anyway matt
just more of the same monitoring the swelling keeping her kidneys and other vitals working you know hoping for the best
kai nods sympathetically before turning back to elizabeth
extreme closeup of lizs lips as kai applies lipstick
joggers go past as matts car pulls into the driveway of the matt lies on the beach watching scottie play in the surf with her snorkel mask on
the melancholy he feels makes him regard his weird little daughter with tenderness
emerging from the water im hungry
what else is new
lets get you something to eat
scottie pops two last fries into her mouth then turns her attention to a strawberry sundae
anxious to spoil her matt watches scottie dig in
yet he remains preoccupied his smile distant
the descendants pink shooting draft draft the food here at the club is so good
yeah they do a good job here
why is it called a jellyfish
its not a fish and its not jelly
you ask good questions
youre getting too smart for me scottie
im going to find out
then im going to ask mom when she wakes up and see if she knows
do you think shes going to know everything she used to know
matt notices a buff guy and some friends headed to a nearby table and his mood sours
scottie follows his gaze
the guy notices the kings and feels obliged to mosey over
this is troy cook athletic and rich
to his friends ill catch up to you guys in a second
matt stares so intensely that troy averts his gaze
so uh whats going on
i mean hows elizabeth doing
i visited her last week you know
i thought she looked pretty good
so whyd you ask
the descendants pink shooting draft draft i dont know i just wanted to know the latest
im praying for her every day you guys
so what i was saying was when i was there i talked to her and her hand moved so i was pretty encouraged
i thought that was an encouraging sign
scottie looks up hopefully
i really think she heard me
look troy go to your friends
no hard feelings
lets just leave it alone
troy walks away stops turns back
i told you matt there were lots of chops and holes that day
i told you a hundred times
what happened to her could have happened to me
it was a super hard day on the water
you werent supposed to be driving troy
she was supposed to be driving
she wanted me to drive
and shes the one who told me to pass the other boat right before the turn
and just your whole attitude toward me matt i mean i feel terrible
i wish it were me and not her
plus i almost drowned myself when we capsized
and my rotator cuff is never going to be the same and im going to miss molokai
just because her hand moved it doesnt mean anything troy
mom twitches at weird times
when you cut off a chickens head it runs all around but its still a dead chicken
the descendants pink shooting draft draft scottie pushes back from the table and takes off toward the pool
matt follows not even gracing troy with a final look
matt catches up to scottie
hey sport dont pay any attention to that guy
that guys a dope
i hate him
i didnt mean to say dead chicken
i dont want mom to die
i know i know
hey lets get out of here
lets go do something crazy
like lets drive to the airport and hop over to the big island and surprise your sister
what do you say
itll be fun
shes not expecting us or anything
and we bring her home
i think she should be here with us dont you
dont you miss her
i miss her
yeah im out of school
she should be too
as matt and scottie head toward the exit scottie flips off a crestfallen troy
a hawaiian airlines inter island airplane takes off
a dotted line goes from honolulu to kona
the descendants pink shooting draft draft matt and scottie look out the window at the big island coming into view
somehow it feels natural to find a daughter of mine on a different island
a family seems exactly like an archipelago all part of the same geographic expression but still islands separate and alone always drifting slowly apart
a red rental car zooms along the famous road near kona traversing rocky almost lunar landscape
matt looks over at scottie dozing
the car turns onto the bumpy gravel road snaking through the campus of this boarding school
matt knocks on a door
an exhausted scottie slouches against a wall
the dorm supervisor appears in a nightgown
the tv is on in the background
hi sorry to bother you
im matt king
yes hello mr
ive come to pick up my daughter alexandra
did you call administration
no i didnt
its sort of an emergency
the descendants pink shooting draft draft all right lets see what we can do
scottie runs down the hall excited by the idea of surprising her sister
which door is it
scottie keep it down
will you both keep it down
its around the corner
they turn down another corridor and scottie knocks on a door
thats the wrong door
the door opens and a girl pokes her head out
go back to sleep yuki
the dorm supervisor knocks on an adjacent door
a moment later a roommate opens groggy from sleep
wake your roommate sweetie
glancing in her room um
alex isnt here
where is she
i think shes
the descendants pink shooting draft draft a coat over her nightgown flashlight in hand the dorm supervisor leads matt and scottie across glistening moist grass
they hear laughter
two figures grow more distinct in the moonlight girls hitting golf balls alexandra king and friend emily
what do you think youre doing out here
its me scottie
emily takes off but doesnt get far she falls flat on her face golf club in one hand bottle in the other
you know i pay year for this crap not to happen
laughing to emily my fucking dad is here
this cracks her up even more
scottie laughs too though shes unsure why
you dont talk like that here
this is unacceptable behavior
whats up dad
you come out to play a few holes with us
we came to get you so you can come home
he took me out of school already
i havent gone for three whole days
the descendants pink shooting draft draft to matt whats happening
why are you here
you need to come home and see mom
alexandra hears this takes a few strides flings her golf club into the night
what did i say about the language
what is it about me that makes women in my life want to destroy themselves
elizabeth with her motorcycles and speedboats and alcoholism
matts car arrives back home and he and scottie get out of the car
alexandra with her drugs and older guys and modeling
matt carries a passed out alex upstairs
scottie scampers ahead opening the door to where matt places alex on her bed takes off her shoes covers her with a blanket and watches this tsunami of a girl
at the stove matt dishes out scrambled eggs
scottie sits in the kitchen nook
and scottie how can i protect her from
the descendants pink shooting draft draft as he brings her plate over i dont like eggs
why didnt you say so before i made them
i thought they were for you
alex trudges in and pulls a coca cola out of the fridge
no answer does mom let you have coke for breakfast
im pretty sure its after eleven
now that we get a closer look we might recognize alexandra from the postcards at the hospital
we also see a resemblance to her mother
how are you feeling
shrugging she plops down near scottie
why am i not surprised
i dont know where to start and we probably shouldnt in front of scottie
i dont mind
i thought you were supposed to be getting your act together
i have gotten my act together
i was just drinking
ive been doing really well but nobody ever seems to notice my grades are better and how i was in that stupid play you guys didnt bother to see
do you even remember the name of it
the descendants pink shooting draft draft its on the tip of his tongue
thats what i thought
so what if i got drunk on the one night you happened to drop in
so the fuck what
hey hey hey
watch your language in front of scottie
sitting with them anyway its good to see you
want some eggs
how long do i have to stay
well discuss that
getting up im going swimming
then ill join you
matt walks out the patio doors
seated on the steps of the shallow end alexandra is on her cellphone
into phone i gotta go
ill see you later
to matt the pools really dirty
what day does the pool guy come
matt notices all the floating leaves and insects
you know i dont know what day he comes
the descendants pink shooting draft draft awesome
matt grabs a pole to skim the surface of the water
sids coming over
a really good friend from punahou
we were in school together for years
he wants to be there for me with all this shit happening
matt wonders his own version of what am i chopped liver
do i know his parents
he might stay over too
is that cool
just then scottie runs out onto the patio dressed in a bra what the fuck
get out of my underwear you freak
ooo la la
dont i look divine
scottie get back inside and change into your swimsuit
scottie flips him off and runs back inside
the descendants pink shooting draft draft real good job youre doing
thats part of why i brought you here
you have to help me
i dont know what to do with her
alexandra slides into the water swims to the other side and props herself on the edge floating her lower body
matt lowers himself into the water too
maybe if you spent more time with her she wouldnt act like such a complete spaz
get her out of town go camp on kauai
thats what mom did with me whenever i was losing it
listen alex your mother isnt well
they just told me she isnt going to wake up
its for sure now
the doctors are going to stop caring for her
do you understand what im saying
your mom wanted it this way
alex remains silent
she has a will see saying we have to do it like this
we both do
thats why i got you
were letting her go
alex looks at him takes a couple quick loud inhalations then slips where she swims face contorted hoping to stay down there forever
finally she emerges and gets out grabbing a towel crying now
the descendants pink shooting draft draft whyd you have to tell me in the goddamned pool
matt climbs out and approaches her arms extended
what do you want
matt drops his arms crestfallen
alex scoffs walks back into the house
they sit together now on sofas
alexandra appears drained from crying
i just found out yesterday
we have to go through this thing together you and scottie and i
and i need to go around and tell people whats happening our family and close friends
sometimes ill want you to come with me
other times i need you to watch scottie
you want me to go around with you and tell everyone that moms going to die
whats the point of that
breaking the news watching them cry dealing with their emotions
how depressing is that going to be
just call them
alex nobody wants to do any of this
but we need to tell grandpa and tutu a few friends
they have the right to know and to be able to say goodbye
i dont want to talk about mom with anyone
whatever you fought about with her at christmas you need to drop it
you love your mother
your mother loves you
the descendants pink shooting draft draft i cant drop it
you have to
you really dont have a clue do you
dad she was cheating on you
thats what we fought about
when i was home at christmas i caught her with some guy
it made me sick to see her near you
i went back to school thinking that was it i was done with her
i was going to call and tell you everything
but then the accident happened and i was waiting until she woke up i guess
and you you didnt even suspect
off his silence that disgusted me too
youre always so busy
caught her with some guy
what does that mean
brandy and i were on our way to swim in the black point pool and suddenly i see mom and some douchebag walk into a house
his house i guess
just a guy
it could have been anybody
he had his hand on her ass
it was gross
youre sure it was her
off her nod then what
the descendants pink shooting draft draft then nothing
she went into the house
a few days later i told her i knew what she was doing
first she acted like she didnt know what i was talking about
like im blind
then she got super mad and started yelling at me and denied it
thats when i decided i didnt want anything more to do with her
who is he
i dont know
what did he look like
matt stands up walks in a little circle he literally does not know which way to turn
then he knows
matt bursts out of his house and starts running down the street
matt comes sprinting around a corner
matt arrives at his neighbors house and lets himself in the kitchen door
matt passes through the kitchen into the living room
the descendants pink shooting draft draft hello
its me matt
mark and kai appear at the top of the stairs looking as though they havent been downstairs all day
oh hey matt
you guys werent sleeping were you
as they come downstairs no we were just fighting
come on in
want a drink
want some coffee
shaking his head what were you fighting about
its not stupid
he wants us to throw parties and have people over which we do of course but who ends up doing all the work
its work thats totally unnecessary
you dont have to do anything
nobodys forcing you to clean and buy a new outfit and think of some goddamn theme cocktail
we can just invite people over last minute and drink whatever we have and hang out
its more fun that way anyway
as they continue their argument matt is struck by the pettiness of everyday life
he at once pities it is impatient with it and longs for it
you know what
we can talk about it later
matt didnt come over to hear us squabble
is elizabeth is there any news
the descendants pink shooting draft draft in fact there is
ill tell you in a moment
who is he
off their silence does she love him
who is he
im sorry to put you in this position
but im not really the one who put you there am i
i just want to know who this guy is that my wife has been
oh matt youre angry
you could be a therapist
very keen powers of observation
i think we should talk another time
i think you need to cool it
hes not leaving
no one speaks
is it troy
that fucking neanderthal
you dont know him
oh dont you even mark
shame on you
youre her friend
im matts friend too
and this is a very unique and dramatic situation
id want to know
dont betray her when she cant even defend herself
matt you may not be able to hear this right now but its not her fault
women have needs
are you fucking kidding me
the descendants pink shooting draft draft your marriage was not
you worked so hard to make partner and no one can take that away from you
but then you made partner and you only got busier
and its not like you were so involved with the girls
she was lonely
so youre going to talk to me in cliches about women
nothing is ever a womans fault
was it still going on when she had the accident
kai looks away
but i stayed out of it matt
anytime kai talked about it i walked away
to kai and you what
you probably egged her on
add some drama to your life without any actual risk
whom do you think youre protecting anyway
she doesnt need your protection its over
shes going to die
dont say that
i almost told you yesterday
shes never going to wake up
its for sure now
you hear me
were pulling the plug
you were putting lipstick on a corpse
come on matt
thats a little intense
kais face dissolves into tears
mark reaches out to comfort her
everybody falls back to earth
i didnt mean to take it out on you guys
does she love him
matt looks at him blankly then at kai
hed like to know too
the descendants pink shooting draft draft how can you ask about him when shes going to die
yes she loves him loved him whatever
shes crazy about him
she was going to ask you for a divorce
matt is stunned but oddly relieved
the truth once revealed blows a calming wind
you still havent told me who he is
i guess it doesnt matter
matt rises to his feet and leave
just as matt reaches the sidewalk mark comes loping out of the house
his name is brian speer
a pet goat tied up in the front yard watches
from a discreet distance we notice that matt has stopped walking to cry
wandering up the driveway matt finds alexandra sitting with scottie and some guy
scottie now wears an oversized t shirt reading shes fat
they stop laughing when they see matt
dad this is sid
sizing him up hello sid
lanky and odd a permanent smirk on his face sid rises from his lounge chair
the descendants pink shooting draft draft sup bro
as they shake hands sid pulls matt into a man hug and thumps him on the back
dont ever do that to me again
to alexandra get ready okay
were going to grandma and grandpas
to scottie auntie esther will come over to watch you
sids coming with us okay
sid this week whats going on is a real family matter
to alexandra sids not going to be interested in meeting your grandparents
hell be bored stiff
dad i told you he was going to be with me
ill be a lot more civil with him around
arms wide shrugging what can i say
matt approaches the car with alexandra and the interloper
does he know what were doing
he knows everything
dude your wife is dying and then you find out shes been stepping out on you
get in the car
the descendants pink shooting draft draft matt watches retired military man scott thorson s mumble as he sits at a table glancing over documents
sid is splayed out on a nearby lounge chair
alex seated at his feet
every so often a pet parrot squawks loudly
this is like reading korean
scott ill be happy to walk you through it
tossing the papers jibber jabber
its an advanced directive basically her instructions on what medical procedures she wants or in this case does not want
no prolonged mechanical ventilation no i know goddamn well what it says
says she doesnt want everyone waiting around while she spoils like milk
says if the doctors cant do squat shed just as soon get on with it
he stares off into space
gramps are you okay
elizabeth had the good sense to write this thing here
always a thoughtful girl
a strong girl
a hell of a lot stronger than her brother
barry whines his way through life
might even be a homosexual for all i know
yeah scott i dont think so
the descendants pink shooting draft draft and shes stronger than you matt
she lived more in a year than you did in a decade sitting in your office hoarding all your cash
all that money you refuse to use what the hell good is it
and now you and your family are cashing in your chips what the hell for
maybe if youd let my baby have her own boat and bought her some safe equipment or let her go on those shopping sprees women like maybe she wouldnt have
gone in for those thrill sports
maybe if youd provided more thrills at home
and you alexandra
putting your poor mother through hell when all she was trying to do was instill some sense and drive in you
shame on you
you should try to be more like her
shes a good girl
shes a good girl
the old man climbs to his feet and takes a few steps away
hands on hips he looks up as though gauging the weather
then he clears his throat wipes his face with his sleeve turns back
you all want a drink
as he wanders away toward the kitchen scott returns pushing a little drink cart
behind him trails his wife alice
an alzheimers victim alice is a sweet woman alert but unable to grasp or recall
oh do we have guests
kissing her hi alice
good to see you
its me matt
good to see you too
the descendants pink shooting draft draft hugging her hi tutu
shes your granddaughter
and this is your son in law matt
this is your family
well except this kid
i dont know who the hell he is
to sid who are you
why are you here
hes my friend
alice were going to go to queens hospital today and see elizabeth
ive never met a queen before
i have to put on a nice dress
sid bursts out laughing
is she serious
you be quiet son
then no alice
we need to go visit her in the hospital
she needs us just like when she was a little girl
lets think about what she might want in her room
well take it to her and put it next to her bed
but shes a queen
i have to look good for a queen
dont you want me to look good
the descendants pink shooting draft draft sid laughs again
shut up alice
then sorry old gal
you go ahead and say whatever you want
ive never met a queen before
when sid snickers again scott thorson approaches him and glares
im sorry man
i was just laughing
i think she knows shes being funny
im going to hit you
scott pops his fist into sids face
sid flies back
the car in motion matt glances in the rearview mirror
hows the eye
in the backseat sid holds a package of frozen peas to his puffy blue eye
that was unreal
i mean how often do old people just haul off and fucking cold cock you in the face
hes hit me a couple times over the years
and watch your language
here let me kiss it
hey could you two just cool it around me
you know stop
touching each other so much
the descendants pink shooting draft draft whoa
maybe thats why your wife cheated on you if youre so against touching
slamming on the brakes matt turns around points a menacing finger
even alexandra realizes sid went too far
you little fuck
do you get hit a lot
i dont know
ive had my share
to alex your friend is completely retarded
you know that right
hey my little brothers retarded
dont use that word in a derogatory fashion
matt looks at him
given who sid is theres no reason to think he wouldnt have a retarded brother
i dont have a retarded brother
you suck sid
speaking of retarded do you ever feel bad for wishing a retarded person or an old person would just hurry up
sometimes i wait for them to cross the street and im like come on already
but then i feel bad
rather than lashing out again at sid matt turns around and lowers his head into one hand squeezing his temples
its all getting to be too much for him
the descendants pink shooting draft draft noticing his anguish dad
dont forget i know where he lives
matt thinks a moment then get in the front seat
matts car passes by the well known crowded surf point overlook
been doing any surfing over there on the big island
i havent surfed in years
yeah how come
you were so good
at first i stopped because i got my period and didnt know how to use a tampon
didnt want to attract sharks huh
so i wouldnt go for you know five days or so and then i guess i just stopped
why didnt you ask mom to show you or teach you or whatever
the car continues on
the descendants pink shooting draft draft i didnt even tell her i got my period for like a year
she was always pushing me to look older and act older so i just
even i know how to use a tampon
the first time i got my period i thought i shit my pants
ew maybe you did
sid shut up
are you sure he knows whats going on with our family
because he sure doesnt act like it
the car creeps down a street of lovely homes
do you know anything about him
like what he does or if hes married
just his name
why didnt you ask kai and mark
i just didnt
i didnt want to get into it
well google him later
okay there it is
matt pulls over opposite a supremely average looking house
the descendants pink shooting draft draft there
he lives there
well i cant say for sure he lives there
thats just where i saw them
and you just happened to be driving by
sadie was driving
we both saw it
they all observe closely very focused
its just a house
that house is a piece of shit
at least go after a guy whos got a mansion
and do you think hes married
thatd be pretty cold blooded to do it in a house where youre married
sid please be quiet
what are we going to do
i dont know
im just showing you the house
they all think a moment
should i go ring the bell
tempted then no wait this is stupid this stalking or whatever the hell were doing
we came we saw
no one moves
its not like were stalking him exactly
the descendants pink shooting draft draft a plumbing truck drives up the road
the three of them reflexively crouch down before catching themselves
what would you do if you saw him anyway
talk to him or punch him or what
i guess i just want to see him
all i know is someone messed with my girl all hell would break loose
i mean youd never do that to me would you
you know if we ever got married
fuck around on me
depends on how you treated me
thats enough now
and were not getting married
starting the car okay thats enough
were getting out of here
matts just about to turn back onto kahala avenue when dad stop
the descendants pink shooting draft draft just go back a couple of houses
matt does so checking that the coast is clear
there he is
there who is
matt and sid look toward a house for sale
at first they dont get it but soon their gaze drifts to the complete with a photo of the broker none other than brian speer his big white smile contrasting
starkly with haggard unshaven matts scowl
now we know what he looks like
must be pretty handy for a dude having an affair to have some empty houses at his fingertips
as matt and alex look at him im just saying
thats how id do it
alexandra climbs out of the car to grab a flyer and take a photo of brian speer with her phone
images of honolulu at dusk turning into night streetlights turning on across an entire neighborhood boisterous pau hana drinkers at a bar a bus releasing weary commuters an overhead shot
of the environs of the king house
i trusted you
but there was always something about you i didnt trust
the sound of an internal phone ring begins
a sitting area off the bedroom is where elizabeth displays her trophies and sports memorabilia
the descendants pink shooting draft draft this is where matt now sits nursing a whiskey and pressing a phone to his ear
hi this is brian speer at kaimana prudential realty
sorry i missed you
leave a message with your name number and time of call and ill get back to you just as soon as i can
looking as though hes about to vomit matt hangs up regards the flyer on the coffee table before him
matt looks up to see sid in his boxers
did you call him
none of your business
and put some clothes on
and youre not sleeping in alexs room
in fact you should really go home son
alex wouldnt like that
take it or leave it
were going to do what were going to do
im not going to make it easy for you
im just fooling with you man
were not like that
guest rooms awesome
then just call him
matt sits on the bed listening once again to brian speers outgoing message
the descendants pink shooting draft draft on the beep yeah hi brian
my names uh herb fitzmorris
im interested in that house youve got on koloa street the one with the plantation shutters
as matt leads his daughters toward elizabeths room let me go in for just a quick moment alone first
ill be right out
matt closes the glass door behind him and slides the privacy curtain across it
he looks at his wife
shes starting to look different her face more gaunt her hair more matted
since the last time we saw her other items have been added around her bed
along with draped leis we see a childhood doll diplomas and of course sports medals and ribbons
an antique quilt covers her legs
her father meant it when he said theyd bring her old things
matt crouches down bedside
you were going to ask me for a divorce
so you could be with some fucking fuckhead brian speer
are you kidding me
who are you
because the only thing i know for sure is that youre a goddamned liar
so what do you have to say for yourself
go ahead make a little joke and tell me ive got it all wrong
tell me again im too out of touch with my feelings and need to go to therapy
then isnt the idea of marriage to make your partners way in life a little easier
for me it was always harder with you
and youre still making it harder
lying there on a ventilator and still fucking up my life
you know what
i was going to ask you for a divorce some day
the descendants pink shooting draft draft grabbing a doll tossing it daddys little girl
matt rises looks at her motionless face exhales gets himself together
im bringing in your daughters now
alex is home from school
try to be nice okay
he slides the curtain open and lets the girls in
look whos here
alexandra approaches the bed slowly startled by the changes in her mothers appearance and knowing the end is near
say something alex
people in a coma can hear you
youre supposed to talk to them
tell her how you were drunk the other night
tell her maybe youre an alcoholic
i guess its in the genes
girls be serious
sorry for being bad
for wasting your money on expensive private schools
money you could have used on facials and massages and sports equipment
sorry for everything
looking at matt sorry we werent good enough for you especially dad
thats out of line
the descendants pink shooting draft draft or what
you going to ground me
or ship me off to another boarding school
you going to give me a time out
unable in front of scottie to remind alex that elizabeth is dying matt grabs his older daughter and spanks her
you got served
scottie out in the hall
shes the one out of line
go find sid
i shouldnt be around second hand smoke
raising his hand now
as scottie runs outside did you just spank me
you have no right to talk to your mother that way
shes going to die in a few days
what if those were your last words
i have every right to speak this way
im mad at her
how can you be so forgiving
matt considers this
of course she didnt see his recent outburst and hes not about to let on
ill be angry later
for now lets just think about the good parts
the descendants pink shooting draft draft and dont say that stuff in front of your sister
dont ruin her for scottie
say something else
look mom i know we fought a lot
but i always wanted to be like you
i am like you
im exactly like you
god that came out so dramatic
you are like her
mostly in good ways
maybe some bad ways
remains to be seen
sid saunters inside with scottie in tow
i hear you got spanked
i hear all hells breaking loose in here
approaching the bed hey mrs
im sid alexs friend from punahou remember
nice day outside
not too hot
you know what i think
tough lady like you
i think youre going to make it
i mean im no doctor
what do i know
but thats what i think
matt squints at sid
is he stoned
im staying at your place to help alex out
dont worry mr
s got me on lockdown at night
and i met your dad he packs a mean punch
look at this
bringing his face closer wow
to alexandra if you look anything like her when youre older youre lucky
i mean you know not exactly like she is now
i mean in general
sid turns back for a long look at elizabeth
looking at her phone reina just texted me
shes here visiting her grandma
can she come visit
the descendants pink shooting draft draft dammit scottie no reina
but you said thursday and its almost thursday
i dont get to see her in school anymore
i need her
alex needs sid
i need reina
matt looks at alex who in turn raises her eyebrows what harm could it do
scottie pushes open the door now accompanied by her friend reina who looks around as if the room is dirty
she wears a terry cloth tennis skirt and hooded terry cloth sweatshirt
dad this is reina
reina thats my sister and sid and thats my mom on the bed
alex and matt look at each other bewildered
scottie leads reina to the bed and touches her mothers shoulder
so this is your mother
i guess its true
should i shake her hand
if you want
so reina i hear your grandmothers not feeling well
the descendants pink shooting draft draft yeah
its pretty bad
she got her stomach operated on and then got some stupid infection or something
its pretty gross
well reina thanks for stopping by and here scottie let me give you some money and you two can go get an ice cream or something
too many carbs
well you could go to the cafeteria and get some lettuce
to scottie on her way out you arent a liar after all
dont you want to hang out
no i should go
ill see you at the club
hope your mom gets better
scottie whatd she mean by you arent a liar after all
whatd she think you were lying about
she didnt believe mom was sleeping
so you had to prove to that twat that moms in a coma
what the fuck is in your skull a bunch of stupid pills
shut up you motherless whore
whoa whoa easy there half pipe
the descendants pink shooting draft draft whered you learn how to talk like that
scottie points at alex
matts phone rings
he pulls it out to silence it but notices the caller id he freezes
sensing something alex calmly grabs the phone from him and glances at it
no youve got the right number
this is his assistant sharon
how may i help you
scottie has no idea whats going on but it sure is fun
who is it
oh i see
and for how long
so one or the other
ill tell him
alexandra hangs up proud
matts proud too
that was bonnie tanaka a realtor
she says mr
speer is on kauai till the th but shed be happy to show you the house or you can stop by the open house on sunday
many cars are parked outside
platters of sashimi fruit ahi poke and salads lie atop the antique koa dining room table
longtime friends s to s mingle in the living room and around the pool
we spot mark and kai
the descendants pink shooting draft draft matt is spacing out alone perhaps mentally rehearsing his speech
awkward teen buzz happens by
sorry about mrs
hope she gets better real soon
it really blows
matt nods swigs his drink
buzz now feels emboldened to reveal the cocktail concealed behind his back
please dont tell my mom im drinking
sometimes i steal beers from your outdoor fridge
buzz slinks off
youve all been asking about elizabeth and ive given vague answers
but the reason ive asked you all to come over today is to tell you
matt addresses the gathering
that her coma is permanent
shes not going to make it
the descendants pink shooting draft draft this week tomorrow in fact as per her wishes were going to unhook her from life support
holding for gasps you all know elizabeth she always likes to do things on her own
almost losing it i wanted to tell you all in person
youre all our dear friends our best friends
and the girls and i appreciate so much all the ways youve helped these last few weeks bringing food calling
can we see her
yes for gods sake yes
thats the whole point
go see her as soon as possible
thats what i wanted to tell you
it should be now not after
everyone who loves her deserves a chance to say goodbye
matt waves goodbye to the last guests as they drive off then turns back toward his house
halfway there his exhaustion forces him to collapse onto the moist lawn
sitting there he comes to a realization not one he wants but he knows he must deal with it regardless
youve lost your mind
matt is catching up on work and has a dictaphone in his hand
alex hovers in the doorway
you mean him
tell him to say goodbye
ill only be gone a day or so
ill leave in the morning and be back tomorrow night
if it takes another day fine ill give it two days tops
if i dont find him at least i tried
the descendants pink shooting draft draft drop it dad
youve got way bigger fish to fry than confronting fucking brian speer
are you recording this
im summarizing a deposition
how can you work
how can you go to a movie
to get scottie out of the house
and youre going to tell him to come back and see mom
i just think she would want him to know
just call his office and say its an emergency
on the phone he can escape
in person he has nowhere to go
i want to see his face
i want to change his life
alexander senses his resolve its kind of refreshing actually then breaks into a wicked little smile
then i want to go too
no you stay with scottie
lets all get out of town
a hawaiian airlines inter island airplane takes off
matt sits isolated from his daughters and sid across the aisle from him
the descendants pink shooting draft draft a dotted line goes from honolulu to lihue
matt leads his daughters and sid toward the rental car shuttle when yo matt king
matt turns to see cousin ralph loping over briefcase in hand
like matt he wears the island businessmans uniform khakis and a reyns spooner shirt
grinning and nodding cousin ralph gives matt a back slap hug and greets scottie and alexandra whose names he clearly forgets
whatcha doing here
just came over for a day or two
yeah i just got back from kahului
a little business over there
so you here to talk to some of the cousins
make sure everybodys happy with your choice
pay your respects to cousin hugh
matts smiles to cover the fact that he hasnt actually been thinking about this stuff
no no nothing like that
just a little holoholo
get the kids out of town
but it is holitzer right
we all know its holitzer
cousin hugh wants him they go way back
i got my misgivings though
its not the highest bid by a longshot
the descendants pink shooting draft draft theres an argument to be made for maxing it out
we only do this once in a lifetime
and in this economy yeah no i know
i want to work with you guys ralph i really do
whatever the majority wants ill go along with it
lets just get it over with
hows elizabeth doing
she going to be okay
well shes a tough gal
shell be okay
say where you going hanalei
ill give you a ride
its an open jeep with bad shocks and cousin ralph drives fast
the passengers hold on their hair blown back
turn off over here
lets go see the land
take a last look huh
you got time
i got nothing but time
the descendants pink shooting draft draft cousin ralph makes a turn and heads inland
the jeep stops at a fence where a herd of cattle graze on the other side
matt jumps out to let the jeep through
i think this is where a golf course is going to be
they want the golf course to rival pebble beach you know bring in the big boys
the jeep ascends through pastoral countryside
the jeep stops at the overlook of an astonishingly beautiful swath of land extending from hilltop to bay
all get out walk to the edge look out
are you shitting me
you guys own all this land
it belongs to a trust
but yeah its ours for a few more days
the other side of that ridge too
you cant see it from here
its like this but a little flatter and doesnt have as nice a bay
this is outrageous
pointing to matt yep
big resort there on that point
commercial area over there houses all through there
i think they should put in a big zip line
hell we should have put in a zip line
all continue to ogle this awe inspiring sight
the descendants pink shooting draft draft of course part of me agrees with the cousins who dont want to sell
theyre going to make a pretty big stink at the meeting
i know but we have to sell
the trust has to dissolve in seven years and if we havent sold itll be a huge mess
selling now and distributing the cash is the only clean way to do it
but its a shame yeah
on the other hand hey its just sitting there
no ones using it
at least this way the whole world will be able to enjoy it
to his daughters take a good look girls
in the old days this was part of your great great grandmothers inheritance going all the way back to kamehameha i
with them we look across this land vivid and verdant
down there is where mom and i would camp
we all did all our lives
a lot of memories
what about me
i want to camp
i wish we lived in the old days
we still do
to matt do we really have to sell
doing anything else would get extremely complicated
a lot of your cousins just want the money
everything has its time
i want us to keep it
the descendants pink shooting draft draft matt looks over at scottie then at alexandra
its clear that alexandra is moved by this sight
can you like specify what businesses theyll put here
because you should totally get a cheesecake factory
only one so fars in waikiki and its awesome
you definitely need a cheesecake factory
and taco johns
the kings approach a nearby monument commemorating john lowell keoni king
the plaque depicts a smiling man atop a horse
to the girls my grandfather
he really loved this place
so did your mother
so does your mother
cousin ralph turns off the kuhio highway and into princeville which greets visitors with an immense faux italian fountain
passing through this immense development matt notices the names of the condo complexes the sand piper the island tropic etc
and he observes tourists along the edge of the golf course with their visors and fanny packs
ralph drops our friends off
alex and sid slump against a marble pillar
scottie has taken her shoes off to slide across the shiny floor
heres your credit card back mr
and how many keycards will you be needing today for your deluxe suite
the descendants pink shooting draft draft lets say three
by the way
im supposed to meet a buddy of mine i think is staying here
s checking computer im not showing anyone by that name
matt is on the telephone nodding gravely
no i understand
matt hangs up blinks a few times spaces out a moment
then he slides open the glass door to the where he finds alexandra smoking
put that out will you please
alex shoots him a look then stamps out the butt on the bottom of her shoe
you could at least smoke lights
just got off the phone with dr
they did what they had to do a couple hours ago
theyve moved her to another floor
they say she seems comfortable still breathing on her own
shes doing okay
the descendants pink shooting draft draft alexandra nods at this news and looks off
matt joins her in gazing out at hanalei bay
so how are you doing alex
what do you mean
you mean considering moms
circling the drain
no i mean other than that
you havent been using have you
no jesus im not using
not at all
i smell pot all the time on sid
so you just stopped
look dad its no big deal
kids do drugs and they stop
unless theyre like super ghetto
and you sent me to boarding school remember
i couldnt get anything anymore
so no im not doing any drugs
but i still think theyre fun
okay maybe a little pot once in a while
and a little drinking
she cant deny that
why are you being so honest
yeah well im proud of you
the descendants pink shooting draft draft not much to be proud of
yeah there is
we shipped you off
let them handle it
and now youre here helping with scottie helping me
you want to know what really pisses me off
that she wouldnt end it
not even when she knew she was busted
how are we supposed to feel about that
i guess she really liked him
so how are we going to find this guy sherlock
well why dont you two take scottie to the beach
im going to call around a little
were on an island for christs sake
everythings just one degree of separation
getting up well find him
matt scans the beach as he ambles toward sid and his daughters lying on towels
scottie is snuggled close to sid
matt notices lumps of sand stuffed into scotties bikini top
hey whats in your suit
theyre my beach boobs
take that out
alex jesus whyd you let her do that
you too sid
lying on her stomach alex lifts her head
the descendants pink shooting draft draft i dont know
take them out stupid
big boobs look kind of fatty
scowling scottie gets up and starts pulling the sand out of her suit as she stomps toward the water
the hotels were a dead end but i took another shot with his office
hes definitely in hanalei renting a house somewhere probably one of those cottages around the bay
who wants to go for a walk
matt grimaces not whom he was hoping for
alex ties the straps of her bikini and flips over
yeah lets go
our friends weave their way among beach goers
matt has thought to bring along a print out of brian speers photo which he and alex glance at discreetly
sid trails behind
catching up to matt can we swim with the sharks
i read in the hotel magazine how they put you in a cage in the ocean and throw shark feed in the water and sharks swim right up to you
can we do that
scottie were not really here to do stuff like that
the sun approaches the horizon
the descendants pink shooting draft draft father daughters and sid have walked past people and houses
now theyre walking just to be walking
we see them from a distance although we hear them very close
howd you and mom meet
i was with a law school buddy from the mainland and i took him to the club
we were just coming in from paddling and your mom was on her way out and she looked at me and said do you think its going to snow today
we all got beers when she came back in
i had already seen her around
that was it
i got her number
did you think she was pretty
she knocked me out
what do you love about her
i dont know
the way we are with each other most of the time anyway
i love how shes more capable of feeling joy than anyone ive ever known
i just like being with her just riding bikes or going out to dinner even if its just a plate lunch at rainbows
years ago we used to do a lot of paddling together
can we drop this
mimicking what do you love about mom daddy
shut up already
to matt and stop babying her
were just talking
our friends continue walking this time amid thick trees along the shoreline
again we see them from afar
the descendants pink shooting draft draft your mom got chased by a shark once
very close call
when was that
we were on molokai with mark and kai and your mom was out surfing and saw a shark right beneath her on a wave
like right beneath her
she got down on her stomach and started paddling like crazy and this big fin kept following her
she even paddled up onto the nearest rocks instead of all the way to shore
got cuts all over her legs and hands
only time i ever saw your mother scared and she was really scared
she even threw up
crying and shaking
i had to hold her for a long time
she really thought she was going to die
of course she hid all that from the mitchells turned it into a funny me versus a shark story
i told her
i told her it wasnt her time yet
they continue in silence a few moments
i wish mom was here
the sun is now very low on the horizon as our friends make their way back to the hotel
again we see them from a distance
ill ask you that same question scottie
what do you love about mom
lots of stuff
shes not old and ugly like other moms
the descendants pink shooting draft draft i like her stories like how she streaked at the wedding and the time she beat a wild pig with a shoe
how about you alex
why are we still talking about this
then i like how shes not afraid of anything
the four are splayed out watching tv amid the messy remains of room service dinner
alexandra and scottie wield the remote and stumble upon the channels promoting direct access adult movies
lets watch one of these
were not watching porn
reinas dad watches pornos
reina calls them masturbation movies
her dad has some
she plays them when her parents arent home and one time invited boys over to see if they grew down there
were you there
have you seen any of those movies
youve got to watch her with the internet
and reinas dad
scottie reina is a fucked up ho bag and you need to stay away from her
do you want to end up like me
the descendants pink shooting draft draft i mean the earlier me when i was mean to you and yelling at mom all the time
well reinas going to be a meth head and shes going to get used by stupid guys
shes a twat
shes a twat
running across the room twat twat twat twat
to alexandra i dont get it
i dont know what to do
these things she does
what goes on in her head
you werent like that
itll go away
im not so sure
i mean look how you kids talk in front of me
its like you dont respect authority
alex looks at him authority
matt tosses and turns gets up and goes to the bathroom
exiting the bathroom he decides he should make a routine inspection and wanders into where he eyes a lump on the fold out bed
he creeps up when sid awakens
hey whats up
the descendants pink shooting draft draft checking on me or something
a sheepish look on his face matt takes a seat on the edge of the bed
i dont uh
i havent been sleeping very much lately
im worried about my daughters
im worried theres something wrong with them
i used to do some messed up shit when i was a kid
its going to get worse after your wife dies
what does alex really think about this stuff thats going on
what does she say
what do you mean
i thought she talks to you all the time
we dont really talk about our like issues
we just i dont know we deal with our shit by talking about other stuff and having a good time
what would you do if you were me
how would you handle my daughters
how would you handle
the situation of this guy were trying to find
matt cant believe what he just asked but hes desperate for clues from even the unlikeliest source
the descendants pink shooting draft draft i told you what id do id lay his nuts on a dresser and hit em with a spiked bat
with the daughters i dont know
id take them on a trip
or no id buy em a bunch of shit
like with all the money youre going to get when you sell the land youre going to make stupid money right
dude you could buy them anything
matt questions his sanity at having asked sid any advice
do you want some of it
if i gave you a lot of money right now tonight would you leave
why would i leave
no sid im asking you a favor
if i give you money will you leave
i get it
is that what you want
you want me to go
i guess not
look dude youre right
if i had daughters i wouldnt know what to do
exchange them for sons i guess
then i might wind up with something like you
im not so bad
youre about a hundred miles away from smartville
the descendants pink shooting draft draft youre mistaken counselor
i have good hygiene
im an decent guitarist a good cook
i cook food all the time
im vice president of the punahou chess club
and i always have weed
im sure your parents are proud
my moms sort of busy right now
what does she do your mom
shes a receptionist at a pet clinic
but mostly shes been getting the house together after my dad died
my dad died a few months ago
at first refusing to fall for it matt sees this is no prank
actually both drivers were drunk
sid smiles and nods as though to make matt feel better about the sad news he just shared
ill see you tomorrow
matt jogs along the nearly empty beach just a few surf fisherman and paddlers
hes clearly out of shape but makes a good effort
another guy jogs toward matt wearing a stanford lacrosse t shirt and running shorts with long slits up the sides
they pass each other
matt continues on a moment in disbelief then turns around and follows
his strides long and efficient brian gives matt a run for his money
the descendants pink shooting draft draft soon brian cuts up the beach toward one of the cottages that line the bay
matt follows awkwardly trying to appear nonchalant
under his breath hi you dont know me but i know you
hi you dont know me but i know you
brian speer right
hi im lizs husband
brian disappears up a little path through a hedge
matt quickens his pace toward where he spies on brian walking across a wide lawn toward a lovely old cottage
you dont know me but i know you
brian disappears inside emerging moments later chugging courage gathered matt is about to charge forward when he stops short the door opens again and out comes a beautiful woman in
a white bathing suit and white sun hat
then two little boys
fuckers got a family
not the right moment
the sun is higher and the beach is growing populated
matt sits on the sand glancing occasionally back toward the cottage
next to him lie his daughters and sid
suddenly two boys brians kids come running through the hedge and past matt on their way into the water
matt turns around to see brians wife julie speer dutifully trailing behind
stay in the zone please
that means you skylar
and you too colt
low skylar and colt
the descendants pink shooting draft draft matt watches the little boys flop into the surf
speer follows wading in up to her calves
matt stands to look whether brian is coming down to the beach too
no such luck
to alex ill be right back
matt gets to his feet brushes off sand and walks casually toward mrs
speer maintaining a comfortable distance
matt takes up a casual stance near mrs
speer and pretends to look out at the water just hanging out
speer continues to keep a watchful eye on her boisterous boys
looks like you got yourself a handful with those two
must keep you pretty busy
theyre pretty non stop but theyre at a really fun age
how old are they
eight and ten
pointing i have two girls
ten and seventeen
that whole non stop thing
that never changes
you guys live here
we live on oahu
the descendants pink shooting draft draft oh so do we
yeah im just getting my girls out of town for a couple days
their uh their mother is in the hospital so i thought id give them a little break
shell be fine
if you dont mind my asking
just a little boating accident
hit her head a little too hard
does julie recognize any of this or even recognize him
doesnt seem like it
or one with a motor
laughs then one with a motor
shes actually sort of charming this julie speer
well good luck with that
i wish her well
skylar dont go so far
you guys staying in one of the cottages over there
yes my husband had to come here for work so we thought wed all make a little vacation of it
he knows the owner so hugh king
the descendants pink shooting draft draft thats right
hes my cousin
then you probably know my husband
that hangs there a moment
matt suppresses the sudden desire to spill the beans
no cant say as i do
oh i just assumed since hes been dad
dad come here
something bit me
matt looks over to see scottie very agitated about something
nice talking to you
matt trots off
images of hanalei as the sun begins to set over the magnificent taro fields
wind rustles the trees
mist falls into the valley
how can i forgive her for loving someone else
did she even know about his family
was she that in love
does she miss him from her coma
does she wish he could be with her and not me
our friends walk along roadside tourist shops toward
the descendants pink shooting draft draft a lived in hangout with a wood interior woven mats on the walls and tables carved into with steak knives
a ukulele club jams in a corner
as our foursome enter the joint matt notices yucking it up at the bar with other regulars
to alexandra theres cousin hugh
get us a table
order me something
matt wedges his way in beside his third cousin who despite his booziness and very local flavor is nonetheless a king family patriarch
what are you doing here
i didnt expect to see you until the meeting
he looks over his shoulder to see whom matt might have come in with
yeah scottie and alex
big girls now
so what are you doing here man
just getting the girls out of the hospital for a couple days you know change of scenery
the descendants pink shooting draft draft yeah boy what youve been going through
thats a tough deal
taking a drink but elizabeth hey shes shes a tough gal ill tell you that
shell make it
get you a drink
sure whatre you having
barney an old fashioned for my cousin here
nice to see you matt
how you been otherwise
not much otherwise
between our business and the hospital you know ive just trying to keep my head above water
so listen i see you have some people staying in the cottage
oh hey mattie if id known you were coming i coulda no no no im just wondering about the guy youre renting to
i think his name is brian speer
yeah yeah real determined son of a bitch
hes lous sisters
lou has a sister and the sisters husband
lous brother in law is cousins with that guy
you mean the cottages on the bay or the cottage back by the trail
the guy with the wife and two boys
the descendants pink shooting draft draft yeah thats right
determined son of a bitch
anyway the point is the guy were doing business with is that guys brother in law
works for him
thats the guy
what do you mean the guy were doing business with
who do you think
thats what im saying
thats dons brother in law in the cottage
you dont know him
i would have thought youd know him
hes a realtor over by you
so if we sell to don and thats what were going to do right
thats what you want too
nice guy don
hell do right by us
then when don develops and re sells and leases and all that yeah yeah hes letting this brother in law in the cottage handle the transactions
a lot of them anyway
big score for that guy
it takes a moment for this stone to drop to the bottom of matts well
whats he like
the descendants pink shooting draft draft brian speer what else do you know about him
the buggas lucky
his sister is married to the guy
son of a bitch is going to make a shitload of money on commissions
not if we dont go with that bid
cousin hughs eyes emerge momentarily from their drunken fog to give matt a firm steely warning
we all want don
you do too matt
youve said as much
no i know
good to see you hugh
see you at the meeting
ill be there
firmly on matts face as he processes this horrifying news delivered so casually
matt takes a seat
scottie and sid eat fried appetizers
alexandra just sits watching the musicians
this place rocks
we ordered you mahi
the descendants pink shooting draft draft low great
the music grows more frenetic
matt looks around the room alienated from everything from the fried food and the tourists from the umbrellas in the drinks from his daughters enjoying the music and this cretin
why cant a nuclear bomb blow the whole island up right now
the light is swiftly fading and our heroes are little more than silhouettes as they walk back to the hotel
sid and scottie talk and laugh together
alex walks with her father
so guess what
turns out brian speer is connected to don holitzer
whos don holitzer
the guy were going to sell to
and that woman today at the beach
that was his wife
then the hottie with the hat
off his nod so hes married
why didnt you say anything
its him i want to talk to not her
i know where their cottage is
so lets do it right now
lets go knock on his door
thats what im saying
alexandra quietly exults
the descendants pink shooting draft draft dont do that
dont be excited
this isnt fun
well its what we came here to do
so you to talk to his wife while i talk to him
and figure out some way to distract scottie and their kids
sid come here
the team are gathered for a little huddle
listen dad and i are going to go talk to some friends while sid takes you back to the hotel okay
i want to come too
who wants to sit around talking in some house
lets ditch these losers and go watch some serious yeah
as they walk away to matt low give em hell boss
matt and alexandra approach the cottage from the road and start to walk around it toward the beach
are you ready
what should i say
the descendants pink shooting draft draft youll think of something
youre a lawyer
im sorry for sucking you into this
i should be doing this alone
its selfish of me
im the one who sucked you in
im the one who knew
just as they are round the house toward the lanai julie speer backs out of the screen door with a plate of hamburger patties
alex nudges matt
dont be a pussy
stiffly hi there
the screen door slams
julie looks over
its the guy from the beach today
yeah hey im such an idiot
i just figured out i do know your husband
my daughter and i were on our way back to the hotel from dinner and we thought wed drop by and say howdy
come on up
im matt king
this is alexandra
im julie speer
yeah i thought that was you
the descendants pink shooting draft draft youve been in the paper so much lately
i figured you had to know brian
hes been pretty involved
yeah no i know yeah super involved
maybe ive met him in passing
i dont know
so i guess you guys are deciding really soon
a couple of days right you and your family meet
thats probably a conflict of interest or something
no its okay
youre right itll all be over in a couple of days
you guys want a burger
we just ate thanks
a drink then
as alex and matt agree a figure appears at the screen door
brian speer emerges a bag of buns in one hand
hi im brian
brian we may have met before
my wife is elizabeth king
i think you may have met her too
our daughter alexandra
brians big grin wilts
i was just going to get drinks
matt nudges alexandra who suddenly remembers her duty
do you need help
the descendants pink shooting draft draft over her shoulder no no i got it
alex is glad to keep her ringside seat for the moment
all buckle their mental seatbelts
elizabeth is dying
and shes dying
we unhooked her from the machines this morning
shell be dead in a few days
were not here to hurt you
we just thought shed want you to know
as theyve plotted alex and matt study brians paralyzed face
they exchange a glance then look back at him
this is him
why would she go for him
well hes very articulate
i never thought it would come to this
youre sorry my moms going to die
youre sorry you fucked her
youre sorry you fucked over my dad
im sorry for all of it
look pal like she said im not here to wreck your life
i just came to give you a chance to go to the hospital
i dont know how long youre planning on being here but im sure you can think of an excuse to leave
you must be good at that
you can be alone with her to say goodbye or whatever you want
do you hear what im saying
the descendants pink shooting draft draft brian seems deeply lost in his own thoughts
then okay look i cant have you here
julie returns with wine for matt and a soda for alex
here we go
noticing everyones so serious
please dont tell me youre talking about business
were talking about love
brian call the boys in for dinner
let them play a while longer
they all stand there a moment
matts unsure how to play this out
he shoots a quick panicked look at alex who scrambles to keep the ball rolling
awesome cottage youre renting
yeah say prime hanalei location
i used to come here as a kid before it was a vacation rental
alex your great uncle warren and aunt lillian built it back in the s
havent been inside in years
well give you a tour
or brian maybe you could give my dad a little walk down memory lane and julie and i can chat out here
yeah id like that if you dont mind
just a quick look
the descendants pink shooting draft draft sure
but its not like i live here
matt walks up to the door making a point to let brian open it for him
brian sweeps his hand around the room
here it is
how did you meet
for a moment brian looks tricked as if matt really did just want a tour of the house
i cant do this
neither can i
how did you meet
i thought you said you came here just to tell me
i changed my mind
and i cant very well ask her the details
howd you meet
at a party
super bowl party
figuring it out at the mitchells
does that help
does that make it better
the descendants pink shooting draft draft hey im doing you a favor here
i could go out there right now and fuck you up so get a better attitude
howd you get the nerve to ask her out
brian drops his head rubs his temples
i want to know what makes a person cross that line
was it about the deal
is that when you decided she was for you
its not what you think
it just happened
nothing just happens
everything just happens
was she going to leave me
she would have
but i i uh
i didnt want that
that wouldnt have happened
i love julie
anguished please dont tell her
i dont know what ive done
did she say she loved you
brian nods slightly
do you love her
brian looks down
you dont love her
you dont love her
you just used her to get to me
no i told you
i wasnt trying to get to you
the descendants pink shooting draft draft it was an affair an attraction
and she got sort of
carried away with the whole thing and i guess i went with it
i mean i didnt exactly say no to things
i should have
i love my family
then i guess its all working out
her lips are sealed and you dont have to go through the trouble of dumping her
hey hey thats really unfair
i had have a lot of respect for her
shes a wonderful woman
too bad her husband found out
you cant win em all
one more question
have you ever been inside my bedroom
you could have had the decency to lie about that one
well shes in queens hospital if you want to say goodbye
that really is all i came to say
shouldnt you be with her
matts face slackens into overwhelming sadness
matt swings the screen door open
alex sits with julie
skylar and colt are still running around the yard
yeah great all remodeled new appliances
alex we should be getting back
well hey thanks for stopping by
really nice to meet you both
maybe well see you at the beach tomorrow
the descendants pink shooting draft draft yeah maybe
after alex and julie share a quick kiss goodbye a common custom in hawaii julie turns to matt
matt leans in but instead of going for her cheek he kisses her fully on the lips
he pulls away and they exchange a brief vaguely erotic look
then he turns away and into the night
the plane is dark except for overhead reading lights
again matt sid and the girls sit at the very back of the plane
so when do you think hell show up
i have no idea
sid leans forward from the middle seat
was he sorry
i hope he was sorry man
you could have told his wife and you didnt
i hope he knows how lucky he is
i would have told her everything
she deserves to know
or else shes going to be a dumb bitch the rest of her life
im just saying
no need to get creepy
anyway doesnt matter
thats all behind us
yeah the one we have to worry about telling things to now is scottie
ive asked dr
johnston to help us break the news tomorrow
the descendants pink shooting draft draft they turn to look at little scottie dead to the world in the window seat
matt and the kids walk slowly through this different calmer wing of the hospital looking for the right room number
finally they find it and push open the door into while still a hospital room there is no medical equipment present
bucolic colorful paintings on the wall are intended to be uplifting
but unlike the expansive view outside elizabeths icu window here the window looks out partially at a cinder block wall
sid and the kings are greeted by dr
johnston and grief counselor dr
herman who affects a comforting smile
off their greetings this is dr
herman whom i told you about
she works with us in counseling
locking eyes with all hello everyone
the two professionals allow the kings to turn their attention to elizabeth who now lies with no machines at all
around her balloons droop flowers wilt get well cards lie in a pile
elizabeth too is wilting and drooping
her skin is pasty and her cheeks are hollow
how come mom isnt on any more machines
is she getting better
the adults exchange glances
herman approaches scottie
you must be scottie
off her nod scottie i have a present for you
herman hands her a little squeaky rubber octopus she pulls from her pocket
the descendants pink shooting draft draft thats right
its an octopus
such a funny creature with its eight legs
but did you know octopi are actually extremely intelligent like dogs and cats
they have unique personalities and just like us they have a lot of defense mechanisms
im sure you know about the ink sac
she uses ink to confuse her predators
she can camouflage herself
she can emit poison and some can mimic more dangerous creatures like the eel
i keep her to remind me of our defense mechanisms our ink our camouflage our poison all the things we use to keep away hurt
the reason dr
johnston invited me here today is to meet you scottie
ive heard a lot about you
ive heard that youre a wonderful and unique and spirited girl
herman shoots a look at matt before continuing
and ive heard your moms not doing too well and that shes going to die very soon
all watch scottie react to this news
dad is that true
youre going to have to be a very brave girl right now and youre surrounded by people who love you
i came to meet you and tell you that if you ever want to talk about what youre feeling i would like to talk to you too
i can help you face whats going on without all the silly defense mechanisms that work for an octopus but not for us
the descendants pink shooting draft draft okay
thank you dr
herman looks at everyone with great sincerity before leaving
scottie is left holding the octopus
she drops it and it squeaks a little
what the fuck was that
yes well they say shes very good one on one
so moms going to die for sure
we worked really hard with her but three other doctors and i agree shes in what we call an irreversible coma
do you know what that means
it means she doesnt have a brain anymore
not exactly but
yes thats the general idea
so were doing exactly what she wanted us to do if that ever happened
thats why shes not attached to the machines anymore
its for the best scottie
look at her
shes not happy like this
the purpose of medicine is to heal and we cant do that now
do you understand
what will we do with her body
johnston looks to matt for this one
the descendants pink shooting draft draft first moms going to give some of her organs to other sick people so she can help save their lives
thats a really neat thing shes doing
then were going to
were going to scatter her ashes in the ocean
you know how mom always loved the ocean
scottie looks at her mother picturing her as ashes
when will she die
any day now im afraid
but you still have some time
let me know if you have any more questions
the doctor leaves and the room is quiet
scottie is in a sort of trance
come here scottie
scottie goes to her sister who takes her in her arms
do eyeballs burn
dont think about stuff like that
matt and the kids sit in a sort of vigil
alex and scottie read books matt has brought some paperwork sid reads a magazine
elizabeth emits a sigh
all look up a moment before looking back down
the descendants pink shooting draft draft matts phone vibrates
checking the caller id hugh king he opts not to answer
the door opens and elizabeths brother barry thorson accompanies his parents scott and alice into the room
here we are
to scottie hi bingo
cheerful alice doesnt really get whats going on
an emotional barry hugs matt and the girls
eyeing sid there you are again
matt and alex maneuver seats for the thorsons to sit near the bed
barry gets his mother situated then takes a seat himself
remaining on his feet old scott surveys his daughter from a distance
so what did you decide
theres not much left to decide
were just sort of playing it by ear and making sure shes comfortable
i mean what did you decide about the buyer
whos your buyer
even sid and his daughters perk up at this question
matt is taken aback
how much are you getting
dad im sure youll be able to read about it in the paper
i dont need to read about it
i can hear about it right now
the descendants pink shooting draft draft scott lets not talk about that here
its not the time for that
all the same to you i guess
a million here a million there
just ironic thats all elizabeth coming into this misfortune just as youre coming into a fortune
she gave you everything matt
a good happy home two beautiful daughters
matt looks to barry for help but barrys silence and sheepish look imply he buys into his fathers propaganda
scott whats your point
she wanted her own boat
she should have had her own boat one she would have been familiar with
she wasnt even driving
her boat someone elses boat it wouldnt have made any difference
youre not going to blame me for this
sure sure quibble about the details
she was a faithful devoted wife
she deserved more
why fight it
she deserved more
for christs sake take it easy on the man
scott turns to sid like hes about to pop him again
my father has been doing a really amazing job under the circumstances
his point made scott looks at matt and the girls and shuffles to elizabeths bedside puts his hands on alices shoulder
the descendants pink shooting draft draft are we ready to go
gesturing toward the door girls sid
matt sid and the girls quietly go into where they take a few steps away
man that guys a prick
was he always like that
scottie has stayed behind to peek through a crack in the door
noticing the others join her
as barry and alice remain seated their backs to us scott stands above his daughter touching her arm eyes closed
is he praying
opening his eyes say goodbye to elizabeth alice
the old man puts his hand over his mouth and squeezes his eyes shut
then he opens his eyes and places a hand on her forehead smooths her hair back
matt and his daughters watch without moving
the descendants pink shooting draft draft matt sits at his desk lost in thought
the only sound is the tick tock of an old clock reading
then he gets up and starts pacing shooting occasional glances at the blueprints and renderings atop his desk
matt turns off the highway and into a long driveway
matt opens all front doors and lanai doors letting air into the old place
he notices old photos of king ancestors
matt walks around the property alone taking it in and thinking
like everywhere in hawaii the nature here is powerful trees birds spiderwebs
matt plops heavily into a chair on the lanai
its the same angle but now with forty king cousins gathered for the poll
we recognize some faces
amid drinks held aloft a calabash is passed among the cousins into which the each places a folded ballot
matt sits watching the proceedings with cousin hugh cousin six and another elderly cousin at a table piled with papers and contracts
elizabeths not doing well
shell be okay
shes a fighter
the descendants pink shooting draft draft no
we took her off the machines
matt hugh and six finish the count while others mill about mingle drink an early celebration for all except for a group of dissenters off to one side
well no surprise
other than the holdouts who dont want to sell at all its don holitzer
chicago group a distant second
were doing the right thing mattie
at least there aint going to be any wal mart
now its your call and were all behind you most of us anyway
handing him a pen go ahead captain
make it official
its strange thats all
we didnt do anything to own that land
it was entrusted to us
and now were just
hugh and six exchange a concerned look
for a moment we go very close on matts eyes
then i cant do it
i wont do it
im not going to sign
whatre you doing matt
i mean we know you have a lot on your plate right now but youre not going to fuck this up for us
if we dont sell now itll be a mess when the trust dissolves
just sign go to your wife done
the descendants pink shooting draft draft its inevitable matt
you know that
well get out of debt the taxes and maintenance have been leaching us for far too long
the descendants pink shooting draft draft i dont want it to go to holitzer
i dont want it to go to anyone
i want to keep it
for christs sake
we cant move without your approval
and we dont want to
hugh tries forcing matts hand
your heads not right mattie
your heads not right
you want a couple days to think it over
take a couple days
i dont need a couple days
i have the authority and this is what i want
i havent wanted something in a long time
we have other businesses were converting to corporations
we can figure it out
but its utterly unproductive land
it doesnt generate enough income to pay the goddamn taxes
youre the trustee
you know better than anyone we only have seven years left
then i have seven years to figure out how to keep it
cousin hugh draws a long breath looks up at the sky then back at matt
well come after you
just because youre a lawyer doesnt mean the rest of us would be afraid to come after you
but nobody wants to do that
the descendants pink shooting draft draft people will be relieved hugh the whole state
i sign that document its over
end of the line
something that was ours to protect will be gone
even though were haole as shit and go to private schools and clubs and cant even speak pidgin let alone hawaiian we still carry hawaiian blood and were still tied
to this land
and our children are tied to this land
its a miracle that for whatever bullshit reason years ago we own this much of
paradise but we do
and for whatever bullshit reason now im the trustee
and im not signing
and if you sue me itll only make us closer
cousin hugh releases a long breath more like a belch quickly picks his nose exchanges a look with cousin six
then he brings his fingers to his mouth to whistle
all right everybody listen up
cousin mattie has an announcement
rising to his feet matt scans the faces of his relatives
from the way matt sid and the girls are positioned around the room we can tell their presence there is now way of life
scottie snoozes on the little sofa
we may notice that elizabeth is even more shrunken
a knock is followed by appearing in the doorway topped by blonde hair and held by thin bronzed arms
its julie speer
what are you doing here
he rises to help her find a spot to put the flowers
she nods to the girls
i know we just met but i was thinking about you guys these past few days and i knew your mom was here
i dont know
i just felt i should stop by
the descendants pink shooting draft draft you remember alex
this is scottie
this is mrs
were you friends with my mom
no we never met
but i know a lot about her
as they now do often matt and alex exchange a look
well we appreciate your coming by
the flowers are lovely
heading to the door scottie alex
lets go to the cafeteria
the girls follow sids prompt leaving matt alone with julie standing a dying woman between them
i uh im not sure how much you know about my wifes condition but shes going to die very soon
any minute really
thats sort of why were all here
thats why i came
because i know
i came because my husband wouldnt
and that just didnt seem right
i thought someone from my family should come
im sorry i came to your house like that
just barged in on you
its all right
i assume youre angry
of course you are
im angry too
the descendants pink shooting draft draft so he told you huh
after you left that night he was acting really weird
then i started smelling it all over him
id already smelled it
youre a woman
i finally got it out of him
weve been going crazy ever since
not easy with the kids around
its all something i never could have imagined
and then your familys decision about the land
i think youre doing the right thing but brian is well its all so complicated and confusing
brian told me everything
well how can i ever know its everything
when did you find out
have you known for a while
just a few days ago
im angry but im just so sorry
i cant imagine what youre going through
do you mind if i say something to her
matt is unsure but what else can he do
julie approaches the bed
elizabeth im julie
i just want to say i forgive you
i forgive you for trying to take brian
i forgive you for almost destroying my family
i have to forgive you
even though i want to hate you
the descendants pink shooting draft draft okay
thats enough julie
i think thats enough
matt walks to the door and opens it
alex and sid whove clearly had their ears against the door scamper away unnoticed by matt and julie
he didnt love her
just so you know
he didnt really love her
thats why im here
julie heads to the door
at the door she looks at matt
matt looks at her
matt is left alone with his wife and he realizes suddenly that this is his moment
he walks to the bed takes her hand rubs his palm over her hair
he says something to her as though silently praying then realizes he should say it aloud
he presses his lips to hers and puts his hand on her stomach
goodbye my love my friend my pain my joy
the door to elizabeths room opens and alexandra emerges a far away sadness on her face
she walks slowly toward where matt sits with scottie and sid
matt and sid rise to comfort her but shes not in the mood
she allows them each to hug her briefly before turning to scottie
signaling to matt to let her do this alex escorts a fearful scottie toward elizabeths room and reassuring her guides her little sister inside
matt and sid are left alone
to be determined

in the water
sits tied to the seat of a small outrigger canoe
navigate the canoe through the surf
how far do we have to go
not that far
just past the break
steer straighter dad
and a little faster okay
the descendants pink shooting draft draft matt and the girls simply float glancing from time to time at the urn in scotties lap
in the distance loom the hotels and high rises of waikiki
well here we are just the four of us
for the last time
then alex why dont you start
scottie hand her the box
scottie does so
alexandra takes the box reverently she wants to perform this sad strange ceremony without messing up
she opens the box and pulls out a scoop of ashes which scottie looks at unblinking
alex looks to matt who gives her the go ahead and without further ceremony pours them into the sea
fall densely in one spot then slowly darken the water and disappear
alex looks down struck by the weirdness of it all before glancing up at matt
scottie youre next
go ahead its okay
alex passes the box and scooper to scottie
what should i say
just say goodbye
scottie looks at alex and scoops out a pile holds them at eye level and pauses
come on scottie
finally bye mom
a sad scottie pours her scoop into the water
all look down as the ashes descend
the descendants pink shooting draft draft all right scottie here
pass that to me
now matt takes his turn
he looks directly inside the urn at the ashes that were once his wife
a complex series of emotions passes over his face love grief disappointment resignation
without further ceremony he upends the box over the water and pours the rest of elizabeth into the ocean
all three take a long look as the mass of ashes disappears
matt takes off his lei and places it into the water
the girls follow suit
wide angle of the boat floating as the leis float away
scottie lies on a sofa watching television draped with the quilt that lay atop her mothers hospital bed
matt comes over with two dishes hands one to her
one scoop strawberry one scoop mocha chip
matt gets under the quilt with her
moments later alexandra wanders in notices what theyre watching sits next to matt pulls the quilt over her legs
can i have some
the descendants pink shooting draft draft his eyes not leaving the tv matt hands alex his ice cream
as they sit there on the sofa the credits roll quietly over them
