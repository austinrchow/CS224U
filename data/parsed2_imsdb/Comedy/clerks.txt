by kevin smith a dog sleeps on a neatly made bed
a clock reads twenty to six
a shelf of books holds such classics as dantes inferno beyond good and evil the catcher in the rye and the dark knight returns
a framed diploma dusty and unkempt hangs askew on the wall
a snapshot of a girl is stuck in the corner and a bra weighs one end down
a phone sits quietly atop a bundle of laundry
it suddenly explodes with a resounding ring once twice three times
a closet door swings open and a half clad figure falls out
the phone rings yet again and a hand falls upon the receiver yanking it off the trash can o
the rumpled figure lays with his back to the camera phone in hand
no i dont work today
im playing hockey at two
the dog yawns and shakes its head
why dont you call randal
because im fucking tired
i just closed last night
deep sigh jesus
what time are you going to come in
be there be twelve
a picture of a girl leans against a trophy
the picture is decorated with a play doh beard and mustache
swear youll be in by twelve and ill do it
twelve or i walk
the phone receiver slams into the cradle
the rumpled figure slowly sits up and remains motionless
he musses his hair and stands
the dog stands and wags its tail
a hand pats its head
the rumpled figure lays down on the bed
we now see his face
it is the face of dante and this is dantes room this is dantes life
dante grabs the dog and wrestles it
next time i get the bed
he releases the dog and sits up
a steaming shower fills the room
the dog licks water from the toilet
a towel dressed dante opens the fridge and peers inside
he grabs a half empty gallon of milk and closes the door
chocolate milk mix is heaped into a tumbler
one scoop two scoops three scoops four scoops
dante gulps his breakfast while feeling inside the closet for some clothes
some chocolate milk spills on the floor
the dog laps at the small puddle of chocolate milk
dantes feet are hastily covered
a hand grabs keys from atop a vcr
a car backs out of the driveway and speeds down the street
the car pulls up with a screech
feet descend to the ground from the open door
keys jam into a lock and pop it open
dante lifts the metal shutter revealing the door
he opens it and grabs two bundles of papers throwing them inside the store
a very dark room barely lit by the daylight
suddenly the lights flick on revealing the glorious interior of the convenience store
the cat looks at dante as he passes the camera quickly
the paper bundle is snapped open with a knife
newspapers slam into the appropriate racks
one rack remains empty
a coffee filter is placed in a metal pot
ground coffee follows and the mix is shoved into place in the coffeemaker
the switch is flicked and the machine comes to life
the empty newspaper rack with the heading asbury park press seems out of place among all the other stacks of papers
dante rubs his chin and stares puzzled
he rolls his eyes as it occurs to him
the register pops open and a hand extracts a quarter
through murky glass and thin metal grating we see dante approach
he stops and drops a quarter in the slot
he pulls the door down finally allowing us a clear view as he reaches toward the camera
dante pulls a stack of newspapers from the asbury park press vending machine
he struggles to hold them all in one hand as he lets the door slam shut
he turns to walk away but the sound of the quarter dropping into the change slot stops him
he takes a step back to grab the coin
the papers drop into the once empty rack with a resounding flop
the quarter drops back into the register drawer
dante tries to jam the key into the window shutter lock
he looks down at it
the lock is gummed up with gum or something hard and obtrusive like gum preventing the key from being inserted
dante looks around and kicks the shutter angrily
the car trunk pops open and a hand reaches inside pulling out a folded white sheet
a can of shoe polish is grabbed from the shelf
dante dips his fingers into the shoe polish and writes large letters on the unfurled sheet leaning on the cooler
dante stands on a garbage can and tucks a corner of the sheet under the awning
he jumps down
the banner reads i assure you were open
the door sign shifts from closed to the clock reads
dante leans behind the counter the morning routine completed
he stares ahead catatonic then drops his head in his hands
the day has begun
the store with its makeshift banner looming in the dim morning hour just after dawn
a car drives by
dante waits on a customer activist buying coffee
have a good one
do you mind if i drink this here
the activist leans on a briefcase and drinks his coffee
another customer leans in the door
are you open
pack of cigarettes
are you sure
am i sure
are you sure
am i sure about what
do you really want to buy those cigarettes
are you serious
how long have you been smoking
to dante what is this a poll
how long have you been a smoker
since i was thirteen
the activist lifts his briefcase onto the counter
he opens it and extracts a sickly looking lung model
id say youre about nineteen twenty am i right
what the hell is that
thats your lung
by this time your lung looks like this
youre shittin me
you think im shitting you
the activist hands him something from the briefcase
its a trach ring
its what they install in your throat when throat cancer takes your voice box
this one came out of a sixty year old man
drops ring unnhh
picks up the ring he smoked until the day he died
used to put the cigarette in this thing and smoke it that way
excuse me but
this is where youre heading
a cruddy lung smoking through a hole in your throat
do you really want that
well if its already too late
its never too late
give those cigarettes back now and buy some gum instead
grabs nearby pack reads here
its not the same
its cheaper than cigarettes
and it certainly beats this
hands him a picture
its a picture of a cancer ridden lung
to dante ill just take the gum
youve made a wise choice
keep up the good work
the customer exits
maybe you should take that coffee outside
no i think ill drink it in here thanks
if youre going to drink it in here id appreciate it if youd not bother the customers
im sorry about that
another customer comes up to the counter
pack of cigarettes
looks at model whats that
how long have you been smoking
a blank wall
jay steps into the frame followed by silent bob
jay pulls off his coat and swings it into the arms of silent bob
jay then throws down with a makeshift slam dance spinning his arm and fake hitting silent bob
silent bob lights a smoke
i feel good today silent bob
were gonna make some money
and then you know what were going to do
were going to go to that party and get some pussy
im gonna fuck this bitch that bitch
blue velvet hopper silent bob points to something off screen
what you looking at
ill kick your fucking ass
to silent bob doesnt that motherfucker still owe me ten bucks
silent bob nods
tonight you and me are going off that fuckers head and take out his fucking soul
remind me if he tries to buy something from us to cut it with leafs and twigs
or fucking shit in the motherfuckers bag
some girls walk past
jay smiles at them
wa sup sluts
to silent bob damn silent bob
you one rude motherfucker
but youre cute as hell
slowly drops to knees i wanna go down on you and suckle you
makes blow job neck jerks and then i wanna line up three more guys and make like a circus seal
jay makes blow job faces down an imaginary line of guys looking quite like a performing seal
he throws a little humming sound behind each nod
he then hops up quickly
you fucking faggot
i fucking hate guys
yelling calmer neh
a guy comes up to them
all business i got hits hash weed and later on ill have shrooms
we take cash or stolen mastercard and visa
a small crowd gathers around the activist as he orates
it has become something of a rally
youre spending what
twenty thirty dollars a week on cigarettes
fifty three dollars
would you pay someone that much money every week to kill you
because thats what youre doing now by paying for the so called privilege to smoke
we all gotta go sometime
its that kind of mentality that allows this cancer producing industry to thrive
of course were all going to die someday but do we have to pay for it
do we have to actually throw hard earned dollars on a counter and say please please mister merchant of death sir please sell me something that will give me bad
breath stink up my clothes and fry my lungs
its not that easy to quit
of course its not not when you have people like this mindless cretin so happy and willing to sell you nails for your coffin
hey now wait a sec
now hes going to launch into his rap about how hes just doing his job following orders
friends let me tell you about another bunch of hate mongers that were just following orders they were called nazis and they practically wiped a nation of people from the
just like cigarettes are doing now
cigarette smoking is the new holocaust and those that partake in the practice of smoking or sell the wares that promote it are the nazis of the nineties
he doesnt care how many people die from it
he smiles as you pay for your cancer sticks and says have a nice day
i think youd better leave now
you want me to leave
because somebody is telling it like it is
somebodys giving these fine people a wake up call
youre loitering in here and causing a disturbance
youre the disturbance pal
slaps a dollar on the counter im buying some
im no longer loitering
im a customer a customer engaged in a discussion with other customers
to dante yeah now shut up so he can speak
oh hes scared now
he sees the threat we present
he smells the changes coming and the loss of sales when the nonsmokers finally demand satisfaction
we demand the right to breathe cleaner air
wed rather chew our gum than embrace slow death
lets abolish this heinous practice of sucking poison and if it means ruffling the feathers of a convenience store idiot then so be it
thats it everybody out
were not moving
we have a right a constitutional right to assemble and be heard
yeah but not in here
what better place than this
to stamp it out you gotta start at the source
like im responsible for all the smokers
the ones in this town yes
you encourage their growth their habit
youre the source in this area and were going to shut you down for good
for good cancer merchant
the small crowd begins to chant and jeer in dantes face
veronica enters and surveys the mess
the crowd throws cigarettes at dante pelting him in the face
suddenly a loud blast is heard and white powder explodes over the throng
everyone turns to face
veronica as she stands in one of the freezer cases holding a fire extinguisher
whos leading this mob
the crowd looks among themselves
someone points to o
the activist carries his briefcase surreptitiously toward the door
veronica jumps off the freezer case training the nozzle of the extinguisher on the activist
lets see some credentials
he reaches into his briefcase
she pokes the extinguisher nozzle at him warningly
he pulls out a business card and hands it to her
she reads it
youre a chewlies gum representative
and youre stirring up all this antismoking sentiment to
sell more gum
he nods again
through gritted teeth get out of here
he quickly flees
she blasts him with more chemical as he exits
to the crowd and you people dont you have jobs to go to
get out of here and go commute
the crowd sheepishly exits one by one offering apologetic glances
dante tries to regain his composure
veronica watches the crowd disperse disgusted
you oughta be ashamed of yourselves
easily led automatons
try thinking for yourself before you pelt and innocent man with cigarettes
the last of the crowd exits
veronica sets the fire extinguisher down next to dante
dante is sitting on the floor head in his folded arms
it looked like tiananmen square in here for a second
dante is silent
thank you veronica you saved me from an extremely ugly mob scene
dante remains silent
sits beside him okay champ
dante lifts his head and shoots her a disgusted look
all right stupid question
but dont you think youre taking this a bit too hard
i dont have enough indignities in my life people start throwing cigarettes at me
at least they werent lit
i hate this fucking place
you should be going to school anyway
last thing i need is a lecture at this point
all im saying is that if youre unhappy you should leave
im not even supposed to be here today
i stopped by your house and your mom said you left at like six or something
the guy got sick and couldnt come in
dont you have a hockey game at two
and im going to play like shit because i didnt get a good nights sleep
why did you agree to come in then
im only here until twelve then im gone
the boss is coming in
why dont you open the shutters and get some sunlight in here
somebody jammed the locks with gum
bunch of savages in this town
you look bushed
what time did you get to bed
i dont know like two thirty three
what were you doing up so late
persistent what were you doing
i gotta fight with you now
why are you so defensive
would you just hug me
your boyfriend was accosted by an angry mob and he needs to be hugged
she stares at him
what is that
she called you didnt she
oh be real
would you please hug me
i just went through a very traumatic experience and i havent been having the best day so far
now come on
veronica stares at him
whats with that look
i wasnt talking to anyone especially her
look at you being all sort of
i dont know
veronica looks away
you dont trust me dont hug me
i see how it is
all right pissy pants you just go on being suspicious and quiet
i dont even want to hug you at this point
veronica looks back at him
pleadingly give you a dollar
a note on the counter next to a small pile of money reads dante and veronica are slumped on the floor behind the counter
veronica holds dante in her arms his head on her chest
change is heard hitting the counter
the door is heard opening and closing a customer leaving
how much money did you leave up there
like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles
people only get the paper of coffee this time of morning
why do you say that
how do you know theyre taking the right amount of change
or even paying for what they take
theoretically people see money on the counter and nobody around they think theyre being watched
honesty through paranoia
why do you smell like shoe polish
i had to use shoe polish to make that sign
the smell wont come off
do you think anyone can see us down here
you wanna have sex or something
i was kidding
you cant get enough of me
typically male point of view
how do you figure
you show some bedroom proficiency and you think youre gods
what about what we do for you
women as lovers are all basically the same they just have to be there
making a male climax is not all that challenging insert somewhere close and preferably moist thrust repeat
now making a woman cum
therein lies a challenge
oh you think so
a girl makes a guy cum its standard
a guy makes a girl cum its talent
and i actually date you
believe me don juan it takes more than that to get a guy off
just being there as you put it is not enough
i touched a nerve
im astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life
it wasnt directed at you
i was making a broad generalization
you were making a generalization about broads
these are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me
how many what
how many girls have you slept with
how many different girls
didnt we already have this discussion once
we might have i dont remember
it better be up to and including me
pause to count twelve
youve slept with twelve different girls
including you yes
she slaps him
what the hell was that for
youre a pig
whyd you hit me
do you know how many different men ive had sex with
do i get to hit you after you tell me
three including you
youve only had sex with three different people
im not the pig you are
no who were the three besides me
john franson and rob stanslyk
with true admiration wow
thats something to be proud of
and thats why you should feel like a pig
you men make me sick
youll sleep with anything that says yes
animal vegetable or mineral
vegetable meaning paraplegic
they put up the least amount of struggle
after dropping a bombshell like that you owe me
i want you to come with me on monday
theres a seminar about getting back into a scholastic program after a lapse in enrollment
cant we ever have a discussion without that coming up
its important to me dante
you have so much potential that just goes to waste in this pit
i wish youd go back to school
jesus would you stop
you make my head hurt when you talk about this
veronica stands letting dantes head hit the floor
why are we getting up
unlike you i have a class in forty five minutes
a handsome young man willam is standing at the counter
veronica reacts to him
how are you
you work here now
locks arms with dante no im just visiting my man
to dante dante this is willam black
to willam this is dante hicks my boyfriend
how are you
just the soda
and a pack of cigarettes
to veronica paying are you still going to seton hall
no i transferred into monmouth this year
i was tired of missing him
squeezes dantes arm do you still talk to sylvan
i just talked to her on monday
we still hang out on weekends
leaving thats cool
well you two lovebirds take it easy all right
take it easy
exits bye to dante that was snowball
why do you call him that
sylvan made it up
its a blow job thing
what do you mean
after he gets a blow job he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing
its called snowballing
he requested this
he gets off on it
sylvan can be talked into anything
why do you say that
like you said she snowballed him
no i snowballed him
a moment of silence as dantes chuckles fade to comprehension
you sucked that guys dick
how do you think i know he liked
but you said you only had sex with three guys
you never mentioned him
thats because i never had sex with him
you sucked his dick
we went out a few times
we didnt have sex but we fooled around
massive panic attack oh my god
why did you tell me you only slept with three guys
because i did only sleep with three guys
that doesnt mean i didnt just go with people
oh my god i feel so nauseous
im sorry dante
i thought you understood
i did understand
i understand that you slept with three different guys and thats all you said
please calm down
how many dicks have you sucked
let it go
shut up a second and ill tell you
i didnt freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked
this is different
this is important
she counts silently using fingers as marks
dante waits on a customer in the interim
veronica stops counting
half mumbled something like thirty six
lower your voice
what the hell is that anyway something like thirty six
does that include me
walking away im going to class
to customer my girlfriend sucked thirty seven dicks
in a row
dante chases veronica down and grabs her by the door
where are you going
hey listen jerk
until today you never even knew how many guys id slept with because you never even asked
and then you act all nonchalant about fucking twelve different girls
well i never had sex with twelve different guys
no but you sucked enough dick
yeah i went down on a few guys
and one of those guys was you
the last one i might add which if youre too stupid to comprehend means that ive been faithful to you since we met
all the other guys i went with before i met you so if you want to have a complex about it go ahead
but dont look at me like im the town whore because you were plenty busy yourself before you met me
a bit more rational well
why did you have to suck their dicks
why didnt you just sleep with them like any decent person
because going down its a big deal
i used to like a guy wed make out and sooner or later id go down on him
but i only had sex with the guys i loved
i feel sick
holds him i love you
dont feel sick
every time i kiss you now im going to taste thirty six other guys
veronica violently lets go of him
im going to school
maybe later youll be a bit more rational
pause thirty seven
i just cant
she exits in a huff
dante stands there in silence for a moment
then he swings the door open and yells out
try not to suck any more dicks on your way through the parking lot
two men who were walking in the opposite direction outside double back and head in the direction
a videocassette encased in the customary black box flips repeatedly held by an impatient grasp
the impatient customer glares at dante
dante studies a copy of paradise lost making a strong attempt at not noticing the glare
pissed off i thought that place was supposed to be opened at eleven oclock
its twenty after
i called his house twice already
he should be here soon
its not like its a demanding job
id like to get paid to sit on my ass and watch tv
the other day i walked in there and that sonofabitch was sleeping
im sure he wasnt sleeping
you calling me a liar
no he was probably just resting his eyes
what the hell is that
resting his eyes
its not like hes some goddamned air traffic controller
actually thats his night job
such a wiseass
but go ahead
thats why youre jockeying a register in some fucking local convenience store instead of doing an honest days work
tosses tape on counter i got no more time to bullshit around waiting for that sonofabitch
you make sure this gets back
the numbers eight twelve wynarski
and i wanted to get a damn movie too
if youll just tell me the title of your rental choice ill have him hold it for you
storming out dont hurt yourself
im going to big choice video instead
he storms out
dante lifts a ring of keys from the counter
in a whisper you forgot your keys
the half filled trash can swallows the ring of keys
another video anxious customer leans against the video store door
a hapless randal drifts by and stops
he glances at the door peers inside and gives the door a tug
the guy aint here yet
its almost eleven thirty
ive been here since eleven
kicks the door man
i hate it when i cant rent videos
i wouldve went to big choice but the tape i want is right there on the wall
you came for that too
thats the movie i came for
i have first dibs
suddenly snotty says me
ive been here for half an hour
id call that first dibs
aint gonna happen my friend
im getting that tape
like hell you are
ill bet you twenty bucks you dont get to rent that tape
all right asshole youre on
randal walks away
the very anxious customer stands like a sentry at post
the impatient customer storms up
you see a pair of keys lying around here somewhere
randal dances in attempting a soft shoe routine
he sees dante and stops dead midshuffle
what the hell are you doing here
i thought you were playing hockey at one
the boss called
arthur fell ill
why are the shutters closed
someone jammed gum in the locks
bunch of savages in this town
thats what i said
shit if id known you were working i wouldve come even later
a pile of videocassettes is plopped onto the counter with a single key on top
randal balances the pile of tapes on his head
what time do you have to stay till
he assured me that hed be here by twelve
what smells like shoe polish
go open the sore
the impatient customer stops randal
hey did you see a set of keys lying around here
as short round no time for love doctor jones
randal marches off
the impatient customer stares after him
the very anxious customer now sits on the ground next to the video store door
randal balances his burden and shoves the key into the lock
the very anxious customer stares as randal enters the store
the door closes behind him only to be held ajar in a gentlemanly fashion a few moments later
a coffee filter is shoved into the metal pan and someone heaps ground coffee on it
weve seen this same routine before
dante crosses back to his post as randal enters tossing the key into the air happily and catching it
he picks the cat up
some guy just came in refusing to pay late fees
he said the store was closed for two hours yesterday
i tore up his membership
shocking abuse of authority
im a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class especially since i rule
furtively is the pelican flying
dont screw with it
it makes us look suspicious
i cant stand a voyeur
ill be back
randal heads toward the walk in door
a far away wall is the only thing we see but mild gruntings give away an ascension of sorts
randals head rises into view as if hes climbing a ladder
he stops and looks into the lens
the pelican is a vcr thats hooked up to a surveillance camera
it records quickly
a hand reaches into the frame and shuts it off
randal pulls a soda from the cooler
want something to drink
who was on your phone this morning at about two thirty
i was trying to call for a half an hour
i wanted to use your car
he walks by a row of snacks and grabs one without looking at it
dante sits in his seat behind the register
randal grabs a paper and joins him behind the counter
you dont want to know
you called caitlin again
she called me
did you tell veronica
one fight a day with veronica is about all i can stomach thanks
what do you two fight about
i guess its not really fighting
she just wants me to leave here go back to school get some direction
opening paper ill bet the most frequent topic of arguments is caitlin bree
im going to offer you some advice my friend let the past be the past
forget caitlin bree
youve been with veronica for how long now
chicks nuts about you
how long did you date caitlin
chick only made you nuts
she cheated on you how many times
eight and a half
looks up from paper eight and a half
party at john ks senior year
i get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom
caitlin comes in and dives all over me
in the middle of it she calls me brad
she called you brad
she called me brad
thats not cheating
people say crazy shit during sex
one time i called this girl mom
i hit the lights and she freaks
turns out she thought i was brad michaelson
what do you mean
she was supposed to meet brad michaelson in a bedroom
she picked the wrong one
she had no idea i was even at the party
oh my god
great story isnt it
that girl was vile to you
interesting postscript to that story do you know who wound up going with brad michaelson in the other dark bedroom
chess team allan harris
the two moved to idaho together after graduation
they raise sheep
it takes different strokes to move the world
in light of this lurid tale i dont see how you could even romanticize your relationship with caitlin she broke your heart and inadvertently drove men to deviant lifestyles
because there was a lot of good in our relationship
aside from the cheating we were a great couple
thats what high schools all about algebra bad lunch and infidelity
you think things would be any different now
when she calls me now shes a different person shes frightened and vulnerable
shes about to finish college and enter the real world
thats got to be scary for anyone
suddenly recalling oh shit ive got to place an order
im talking to myself here
no no im listening
shes leaving college and
and shes looking to me for support
and i think that this is leading our relationship to a new level
what about veronica
i think the arguments veronica and i are having are some kind of manifestation of a subconscious desire to break away from her so that i can pursue the possibility
of a more meaningful relationship with caitlin
caitlins on the same wave length
i think its safe to say yes
then i think all four of you had better sit down and talk it over
you veronica caitlin
lays paper flat and caitlins fiance
the headline of the engagement announcement reads bree to randal dials the phone
he holds a list in his hand
yes id like to place an order please
a mother and her small child approach the counter
excuse me but do you see videotapes
what were you looking for
smiling its called happy scrappy the hero pup

dante carries a litter box to be dumped
he pauses midstrike and lays it on the ice cream chest
dante picks up the phone and looks at the paper
he dials and waits
yes id like to check on a misprint in todays edition
it says bree to wed asian design major
no no everythings spelled fine
i just wanted to know if the piece was a misprint
i dont know like a typographical error or something
a customer comes to the counter and waits
he looks at the litter box
a black cat suddenly jumps into it and starts pawing around
maybe its supposed to be caitlin bray or caitlin bre with one e
im a curious party
a curious party
dante on the phone im an ex boyfriend
well its just that we talk all the time and she never mentioned this engagement which is why im thinking maybe its a misprint
the customer watches as the cat takes a huge dump leaning on its haunches to accommodate the stinky load
are you sure
maybe theres like a vindictive printer working for you
dante on the phone meaning like someone who maybe i dont know asked her out once and got shot down and his revenge is throwing this bogus article in when
the paper went to press
dante hangs up
he looks at the paper ruefully shaking his head
he then sniffs the air
jay silent bob and olaf lean against wall
not in me
thats what she says
i gotta pull out and spank it to get it on
so i blow a nut on her belly and i get out of there just as my uncle walks in
it was such a close call

to olaf olaf sing
makes pot smoking face nods in understanding olaf busts a crimson metal sneer and cackles deeply
randal leans back in his chair staring up at the tv
the theme to star wars plays
he stands points the remote clicks the tv off and ponders
randal locks the door and walks away while olaf sings for the small crowd
dante is tugging at a can of pringles potato chips
the can is stuck on a mans hand
you hold the counter and ill pull
usually i just turn the can upside down
pulling maybe we should soap your hand or something
straining they oughta put some kind of warning on these cans like they do with cigarettes
i think its coming now
the can pops off and dante staggers back a few steps
the man rubs his hand
i thought i was gonna have to go to the hospital
ill throw this out
it stings a little
a word of advice sometimes its best to let those hard to reach chips go
dante steps behind the counter
the man exits as randal enters
dante throws the canister away
do you know that article is accurate
caitlins really getting married
you know what i just watched
me pulling a can off some morons fist
return of the jedi
didnt you hear me
caitlin really is getting married
which did you like better jedi or the empire strikes back
empire had the better ending luke gets his hand cut off and finds out vaders his father han gets frozen and taken away by boba fett
it ends on such a down note
and thats life a series of down endings
all jedi had was a bunch of muppets
there was something else going on in jedi
i never noticed it until today
randal follows dante as he cleans up around the store
all right vaders boss
right the emperor
now the emperor is kind of a spiritual figure yes
how do you mean
well hes like the pope for the dark side of the force
hes a holy man a shaman kind of albeit an evil one
now hes in charge of the empire
the imperial government is under his control
and the entire galaxy is under imperial rule
then wouldnt that logically mean that its a theocracy
if the head of the empire is a priest of some sort then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion
it would stand to reason yes
hence the empire was a fascist theocracy and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution
more or less
the only problem is that at no point in the series did i ever hear leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief
i think they were catholics
a blue collar man half enters the door
are you open
he goes to the coffee machine and makes a cup of joe
you know what else i noticed in jedi
so they build another death star right
now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the rebels destroyed it
luke blew it up
give credit where its due
and the second one was still being built when they blew it up
compliments of lando calrissian
something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it
i could never put my finger on it something just wasnt right
and you figured it out
well the thing is the first death star was manned by the imperial army storm troopers dignitaries the only people onboard were imperials
so when they blew it up no prob
evil is punished
and the second time around
the second time around it wasnt even finished yet
they were still under construction
a construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the imperial army had to offer
ill bet there were independent contractors working on that thing plumbers aluminum siders roofers
not just imperials is what youre getting at
in order to get it built quickly and quietly theyd hire anybody who could do the job
do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main
all they know is killing and white uniforms
all right so even if independent contractors are working on the death star why are you uneasy with its destruction
all those innocent contractors hired to do a job were killed casualties of a war they had nothing to do with
notices dantes confusion all right look youre a roofer and some juicy government contract comes your way you got the wife and kids and the two story in suburbia this
is a government contract which means all sorts of benefits
all of a sudden these left wing militants blast you with lasers and wipe out everyone within a three mile radius
you didnt ask for that
you have no personal politics
youre just trying to scrape out a living
the blue collar man joins them
i dont mean to interrupt but what were you talking about
the ending of return of the jedi
my friend is trying to convince me that any contractors working on the uncompleted death star were innocent victims when the space station was destroyed by the rebels
well im a contractor myself
im a roofer
digs into pocket and produces business card dunn and reddy home improvements
and speaking as a roofer i can say that a roofers personal politics come heavily into play when choosing jobs
three months ago i was offered a job up in the hills
a beautiful house with tons of property
it was a simple reshingling job but i was told that if it was finished within a day my price would be doubled
then i realized whose house it was
whose house was it
the money was right but the risk was too big
i knew who he was and based on that i passed the job on to a friend of mine
based on personal politics
and that week the foresci family put a hit on babyfaces house
my friend was shot and killed
he wasnt even finished shingling
paying for coffee im alive because i knew there were risks involved taking on that particular client
my friend wasnt so lucky
pauses to reflect you know any contractor willing to work on that death star knew the risks
if they were killed it was their own fault
a roofer listens to this
taps his heart not his wallet
the blue collar man exits
dante and randal remain respectfully quiet for a moment
an angry woman opens the door and pokes her head in
is that video store open or not
randal reads a newspaper
an indecisive customer studies the two rental choices she holds
she looks from one movie to the other repeatedly
attempting a solicit help they say so much but they never tell you if its any good
randal hardly stirs and continues to read his paper
the indecisive customer half turns to see if her comment was even heard
she tries again but this time with a different approach
are either of these any good
randal continues to read
the indecisive customer tries harder then louder and more direct sir
randal continues to read
the indecisive customer holds up her rental choices
politely are either of these any good
randal as always reads on
again flatly i dont watch movies
the indecisive customer is a tad flabbergasted but not put off
well have you heard anything about either of them
randal does his level best to not get involved
the indecisive customer challenges him
in disbelief youve never heard anybody say anything about either movie
i find its best to stay out of other peoples affairs
with a new determination well how about these two movies
holds up the same two randal continues to read his paper not looking up
the indecisive customer smirks smugly at randal and his paper
she has caught him
i just held up the same two movies
youre not even paying attention
no i wasnt
i dont think your manager would appreciate
turning the page i dont appreciate your ruse maam
i beg your pardon
reading on your ruse
your cunning attempt to trick me
defending herself i only pointed out that you werent paying any attention to what i was saying
turning page and reading i hope it feels good
you hope what feels good
i hope it feels so good to be right
there is nothing more exhilarating than pointing out the shortcomings of others is there
the indecisive customer wears a face that belies utter disbelief in the audacity of this most lackadaisical video clerk
the unmoving newspaper illustrates the total disinterest of the news hungry randal
the indecisive customer shakes her head in disgust and throws the movies back onto the wall
in a huff well this is the last time i ever rent here
youll be missed
losing it altogether screw you
she storms out
randal is offended
he hops over the counter and whips the door open
calling after her youre not allowed to rent here anymore
randal closes the door and stands there momentarily totally appalled by her exiting remark then shakes his head
he reaches behind the counter and grabs a ring of keys
exiting he locks the door behind him from the outside gives it a tug to ensure its security and storms off in the opposite direction from the woman
dante is staring open mouthed at something o
randal hurls the door open and immediately launches into his tirade
youll never believe what this unruly customer just said
a hand up to urge him to hush wait
looking around shes in here
this guy is going through all of the eggs
an odd man sits on the floor surrounded by cartons of eggs all opened
he grabs a carton from the cooler case pops it open and examines each egg carefully
this has been going on for twenty minutes
randal and dante study the o
whats he looking for
he said he has to find a perfect dozen
each egg has to be perfect
the quest isnt going well
look at all the cartons that didnt make the grade
the odd man holds an egg up to the light and studies it from several different angles
why doesnt he just mix and match
i told him that and he yelled at me
randal snickers at his friend
what did he say
he said it was important to have standards
he said nobody has pride anymore
its not like you laid the eggs yourself
ill give him five more minutes then im calling the cops
i dont need this man
im not even supposed to be here today
a smoker steps in
two packs of cigarettes
dante manages to break his study of the o
oddity and searches for the smokes
the smoker glances at randal and then at the o
the odd man is spinning an egg on the floor
the smoker looks at randal
still staring at the im as puzzled as you
paying dante ive actually seen it before
you know him
no ive seen that behavior before
looking for the perfect carton of eggs right
a bit astonished yeah
howd you know
ill bet you a million bucks that the guys a guidance counselor
why do you say that
i was in the food city last year when the same thing happened different guy though
stock boy told me that the guy had been looking through the eggs for like half an hour doing all sorts of endurance tests and shit
i ask the kid how come nobody called the manager and he says it happens twice a week sometimes more
get out of here
i kid you not
they call it shell shock
only happens with guidance counselors for some reason
the kid said they used to make a big deal about it but theres no point
the odd man places a handkerchief over an egg on the floor
he quickly whisks the handkerchief away to reveal the egg still sitting on the floor
he said they always pay for whatever they break and they never bother anybody
dante randal and the smoker stare at the o
why guidance counselors
if your job served as little purpose as theirs wouldnt you lose it too
come to think of it my guidance counselor was kind of worthless
grabbing matches see
its important to have a job that makes a difference boys
thats why i kill chinamen for the railroad
and then a little girl comes into view smiling and holding money
she cant be any more than five
innocently can i have a pack of cigarettes
randal without looking up from his magazine completes the transaction
the little girl puts a cigarette in her mouth
randal hands her matches
dante returns to the counter as the girl skips away
dante holds a price gun
did you ever notice all the prices end in nine
damn thats eerie
you know how much money the average jizz mopper make per hour
whats a jizz mopper
hes the guy in those nudie booth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off
youve never been in a nudie booth
i guess not
a female customer pops items onto the counter
dante rings her up
oh its great
you step into this little booth and theres this window between you and this naked woman and she puts on this little show for like ten bucks
what kind of show
think of the weirdest craziest shit youd like to see chicks do
these chicks do it all
they insert things into any opening in their body
to customer hes led a very sheltered life
indicating customer can we talk about this later
the jizz moppers job is to clean up the booths afterward because practically everybody shoots a load against the window and i dont know if you know or not but
cum leaves streaks if you dont clean it right away
grabbing her bag disgusted this is the last time i come to this place
using filthy language in front of the customers
you should both get fired
were sorry maam
we got a little carried away
well i dont know if sorry can make up for it
i found your remarks highly offensive
the customer stands silently awaiting something
well you think thats offensive
randal flips open the magazines centerfold a graphic picture of a woman with her vaginal lips and anus spread wide open
then check this out
i think you can see her kidneys
randal checks out the centerfold wistfully
dante frantically apologizes to the rapidly exiting customer
maam maam im sorry
please wait a second maam
the customer is gone
dantes pursuit stops at the counter
dante turns on randal
why do you do things like that
you know shes going to come back and tell the boss
that ladys an asshole
everybody that comes in here is way too uptight
this job would be great if it wasnt for the fucking customers
im gonna hear it tomorrow
you gotta loosen up my friend
youd feel a hell of a lot better if youd rip into the occasional customer
they dont bother me if i dont bother them
tell me there arent customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis
how can you lie like that
why dont you vent
vent your frustration
come on who pisses you off
reluctantly its not really anyone per se its more of separate groupings
lets hear it
pause the milkmaids
a woman pulls out gallon after gallon looking deep into the cooler for that perfect container of milk
the women that go through every gallon of milk looking for a later date
as if somewhere beyond all the other gallons is a container of milk that wont go bad for like a decade
you know who i can do without
i could do without the people in the video store
all of them
a series of people addressing the camera asking the dumb questions
what would you get for a six year old boy who chronically wets his bed
in front of stocked new release shelf do you have any new movies in
do you have that one with the guy who was in that movie that was out last year
and they never rent quality flicks they always pick the most intellectually devoid movie on the rack
montage insert ooooh
an identical series of customers finding their ideal choices
its like in order to join they have to have an iq less than their shoe size
you think you get stupid questions
you should hear the barrage of stupid questions i get
a series of people standing in various locations throughout the convenience store asking truly dumb questions
holding coffee what do you mean theres no ice
you mean ive gotta drink this coffee hot
holding up item from clearly marked
display how much
peeking in door do you sell hubcaps
dont you feel better now
because my ex girlfriend is getting married
jesus you got a one track mind
its always caitlin caitlin caitlin
jerking head toward door veronica
dante gives randal a shove to shut him up
veronica enters the store carrying books and something covered with aluminum foil
what happened to home by twelve
dante is suddenly by her side taking the books from under her arm
he still hasnt shown up
why arent you in class
lit got canceled so i stopped home and brought you some lunch
what is it
peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off
what do you think it is
kisses her forehead youre the best
im glad youve calmed down a bit
to randal hi randal
exaggeratively impressed thirty seven
to veronica yes ive calmed down im still not happy about it but ive been able to deal
randal makes loud slurping noises from o
why dont you go back to the video store
randal walks past the two and pats veronica on the head
you had to tell him
i had to tell someone
he put it into perspective
what did he say
at least he wasnt thirty six
and that made you feel better
and he said most of them are college guys ive never met or seen
the ostrich syndrome if you dont see it
it isnt there
thank you for being rational
thank you for the lasagne
you couldnt get these shutters open
i called a locksmith and he said the earliest he could get here it tomorrow
bummer well ive gotta head back for the one thirty class
what time do you get finished
but i have a sorority meeting till nine so ill be back before you close
can we go out and get some coffee
kisses him ill see you when you close then
enjoy the lasagne
dante leans against the magazine rack with his lasagne contemplative
randal pops his head in and makes the loud slurping noise again
randal is recommending titles to potential customers
all right now if youre really feeling dangerous tonight then smokey and the bandit three is the movie you must rent
studying box this doesnt even have burt reynolds in it
hey neither did et but that was a great movie right
dante opens the door and leans in
can you come next door
i gotta make a phone call
to dante smokey three thumbs up am i right
the best burtless movie ever made
randal gives his customers the what did i tell you look
the cat lies on the counter
pull back to reveal randal as he rings up an order
the customer pets the cat smiling
awww hes so cute
whats his name
dolly over to dante on the phone
hello is mr
this is dante
did he say if he was on his way here
the convenience store
i know but the other guy called out this morning and mr
synder asked me to cover until he got here
he said hed be here by noon but its one thirty now so i
no that cant be i talked to him this morning
he left at what time
he really went to vermont
when the hell was someone going to tell me
he promised he was coming by noon
when does he get back
youve gotta be fucking kidding me
ive got a hockey game at two and the fucking shutters are jammed closed and hes in vermont
im not even supposed to be here today
deep sigh so im stuck here till closing
this is just great
i just cant believe
im sorry i didnt mean to yell at you
no ill be all right
well thats all i can do right
he hangs up
randal joins him
can you believe this
he didnt mention it when he called you this morning
not a fucking word
so what youre stuck here all day
whyd you apologize
i heard you apologize
you have every right in the world to be mad
that seems to be the leitmotif in your life ever backing down
i dont back down
yes you do
you always back down
you assume blame that isnt yours you come in when called as opposed to enjoying your day off you buckle like a belt
you know what pisses me off the most
the fact that im right about your buckling
im going to miss the game
because you buckled
would you shut the hell up with that shit
its not helping
dont yell at me pal
there you go again
i cant believe im going to miss the game
at least were stuck here together
youve got a customer
randal walks away
what do you want
dante shakes his head in frustration and picks up the phone again
i cant play today
im stuck at work
i know im not scheduled but just forget it
i cant play
neither can randal
hes working too
randal comes back
dante rolls his eyes to the ceiling
getting an idea wait a second
do we have to play at the park
to randal do you feel limber
tape is rolled around the top of a stick
laces are pulled tightly
an orange ball is slapped back and forth by a blade
the hockey players fill the convenience store
some sit on the floor or lean against the coolers but all are either preparing or practicing
randal enters wearing his equipment
dante skates to his side
lifting his foot pull my laces tighter
drops mitt and pulls laces ive gotta tell you my friend this is one of the ballsiest moves ive ever been privy to
i never would have thought you capable of such blatant disregard of store policy
i told him i had a game today
its his own fault
no argument here
i just want to play hockey like i was scheduled to
sanford skates up and skids to a halt
dante let me grab a gatorade
if you grab a gatorade then everybodys going to grab one
so nobodys going to want to pay for these gatorades
what do you care
hey what smells like shoe polish
ive got a responsibility here
i cant let everybody grab free drinks
youre closing the fucking store to play hockey
hes blunt but hes got a point
at least let me maintain some semblance of managerial control here
all im saying is if youre going to be insubordinate you should go the full nine and not pussy out when it comes to free refreshments
as if were suddenly gonna have a run on gatorade
jesus you fuckers are pushy
hey man i hear caitlins marrying an asian drum major
can we not talk about this
fine by me
but youre living in denial and suppressing rage
skating away to all dante said we can all drink free gatorade
a laid back hurrah is heard
are you gonna lock the store
i dont know
you going to lock the video store
look who youre asking here
howre we gonna block off the street
were not playing in the street
then wherere we gonna play
the sign on the door reads the players ascend a ladder adjacent to the door one by one
on the roof they jump off the ladder and skate around
more players join them
from across the street we get the full odd perspective a store with many men gliding around on the roof
on the roof dante skates and passes with another player
redding stretches leaning against the sign
randal pulls his mask on and slaps his glove urging a shot
sanford skates in and takes a shot which randal blocks
jay and silent bob deal to a player he drops money over the ledge and jay throws up a dime bag
dante holds a ball in the center of the court
players take positions
sanford comes to the center and holds the ball in drop position
dante and redding face off and the ball is in play
the game begins as the players engage in a savage ballet
faces are smashed with sticks slide tackles are made shots are taken cus of various players included
inactive players call out encouragement and slander from the sidelines
more game playing including both goalies getting scored on and more face offs
below a customer tugs on the convenience store door
he reads the sign and then backs up into the street attempting to peer over the ledge
above the game continues
below the customer shifts from one foot to the other impatiently
he grabs the ladder and quickly ascends
above from over the ledge of the roof we see the head of the customer peek
skating feet pass rapidly before him and he watches for a moment before calling out
whens this period over
eight more minutes
are you shitting me
i want to get cigarettes
dante skids to the sidelines
out of breath if you can just wait a few more minutes
im gonna break my crazy neck on this ladder
where are you
dante starts to skate away
ill be right back
its almost over
he jumps back into the game
what the fuck is this
i want some service
in a second
fuck in a second
look at you
you cant even pass
i can pass
how bout covering point
dante skids back to the sidelines to address the customer
who are you to make assessments
ill assess all i want
someone dont pass to this guy
to dante you suck
like youre better
i can whip your ass
below a woman pulls at the door
she peers into the store face against the glass
thats easy to say from over here
give me a stick pretty boy
ill knock your fucking teeth out and pass all over your ass
the woman backs up and shielding her eyes looks toward the roof
is the convenience store open
above dante and the customer shout down at the o
simultaneously to customer theres a stick over there
youre shooting against the goal
to the court a new face off pits dante against the customer
the ball drops between the two and dante gets flattened
the customer winds up and takes a hard shot
the ball sails off the court through the air and into a faraway yard
dante calls to the sidelines
give me another ball
there are no more
what the fuck are you talking about
how many balls did you bring
sanford skates up to him
counting there was the orange ball
and the orange ball
dante scrambles to the edge and calls over
are there any balls down there
bout the biggest pair you ever seen
dante looks around hyperventilating
you only brought one ball
i thought redding had like three balls
i thought dante had the balls
nobody has another ball
twelve minutes of game and its over
pause rubs head im not even supposed to be here today
dante skates off
we still get free gatorade right
dante standing on a ladder replaces a fluorescent light
an old man joins him at the foot of the ladder
you know the insides of those are filled with stuff that gives you cancer
so im told
i had a friend that used to chew glass for a living
in the circus
the light in place dante descends the ladder and closes it
and he got cancer by chewing fluorescent bulb glass
no he got hit by a bus
can i help you
well that depends
do you have a bathroom
yeah but its for employees only
i understand but can i use it
im not that young anymore so im kind of
its back through the cooler
say what kind of toilet paper you got back there
the white kind
im not asking about the color
i mean is it rough or cottony
actually it is kind of rough
oh that stuff rips hell out of my hemorrhoids
say would you mind if i took a roll of the soft stuff back there
i see you sell the soft stuff
aw cmon boy
whats the difference
you said yourself the stuff thats there now is rough
thanks son youre a lifesaver
the old man walks off
dante heads back to the counter
the old man returns
say young fella you know i hate to bother you again but can i take a paper or something back there
it usually takes me a while and i like to read while its going on
thanks young man
youve got a heart of gold
the old man sifts through some papers and a few magazines
he comes back to the counter
you know you probably couldve been home already in the time its taken you to get in there
can i trouble you for one of those magazines
i said go ahead
no i mean the ones there
behind the counter
dante glances over and reacts
the porno mags
i like the cartoons
they make me laugh
they draw the biggest titties
hands one to him here
now leave me alone
uh can i have the other one
the one below this one
they show more in that one
dante makes the switch
i appreciate this
the old man walks off
we hear the back door open and close then the front door does the same
randal joins dante
they come all the way here
i close the damn store
for one ball
at least we got to play
randal twelve minutes is not a game
jesus its barely a warm up
bitch bitch bitch
you want something to drink
walking away gatorade
what happened to all the gatorade
they drank it all
after an exhausting game like that i can believe it
as randal its not like were gonna sell out
randal comes back with drinks
you know what sanford told me
offering drink i still cant believe caitlins getting married
julie dwyer died
no im serious
dante is visibly taken aback
oh my god
sanfords brother dates her cousin
he found out this morning
embolism in her brain
she was swimming at the ymca pool when it happened
i havent seen her in almost two years
correct me if im wrong but wasnt she one of the illustrious twelve
youve had sex with a dead person
im gonna go to her wake
no youre not
paulsens funeral parlor
the next show is at four
what about tomorrow
one night only
shes buried in the morning
youve gotta watch the store
i have to go to this
wait wait wait
has it occurred to you that i might bereaved as well
you hardly knew her
true but do you know how many people are going to be there
all of our old classmates to say the least
this is beneath even you
im not missing whats probably going to be the social event of the season
you hate people
but i love gatherings
isnt it ironic
dont be an asshole
somebody has to stay with the store
if you go i go
she meant nothing to you
she meant nothing to you either until i told you she died
im not taking you to this funeral
im going with you
i cant close the store
you just closed the store to play hockey on the roof
exactly which means i cant close it for another hour so we can both go to a wake
dante drives with passenger randal their backs to the camera
you were saying
thanks for putting me in a tough spot
youre a good friend
she was pretty young hunhh
twenty two same as us
an embolism in a pool
an embarrassing way to die
thats nothing compared to how my cousin walter died
howd he die
broke his neck
he broke his neck trying to suck his own dick
shut the hell up
oh my god
havent you ever tried to suck your own dick
youre so repressed
because i never tried to suck my own dick
no because you wont admit to it
as if a guys a fucking pervert because he tries to go down on himself
youre as curious as the rest of us pal
youve tried it
who found him
my aunt found him
on his bed doubled over himself with his legs on top
dick in his mouth
my aunt freaked out
it was a mess
his dick was in his mouth
balls resting on his lips
he made it hunhh
yeah but at what a price
i could never reach
what your dick
like you said you know
i guess everyone tries it sooner of later
i never tried it
dante glares at randal
dante and randal walk up the path to the funeral parlor
i know it was a bad idea to close the store
listen to you
i cant help it
at least when we were playing hockey outside i could see if anyone wanted to go in
its four oclock on a saturday
how many people ever come to the store at four on a saturday
a massive crowd is outside the store
dante and randal run from the front door closely chased by a small crowd of angry mourners
car locks are slammed down
the car screams away
the pursuing crowd stands in the middle of the street shaking their fists throwing things
the car pulls up and randal and dante get out
absolutely nobody is outside
furious i cant fucking believe you
im telling you it wasnt my fault
you knocked the fucking casket over for chrissakes
i was just leaning on it
it was an accident
does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose
so the casket fell over
her fucking body fell out
so theyll put her back in
its not like its gonna matter if she breaks something
opening door just
go open the video store
open the video store
shut the fuck up junkie
jay enters the frame right next to randal
he aims his butt at him and farts
randal lunges for him
dante grabs randal
to randal go open the video store
yeah you cock smoking clerk
to jay how many times i gotta tell you not to deal outside the store
im not dealing
a kid tugs at jays shirt
you got anything man
yeah what do you want
randal heads to the video store
dante enters the convenience store and slides the sign to open
after a few seconds the impatient customer guy who lost his keys appears flashlight in hand scanning the ground
to jay hey did you see a set of keys lying around here somewhere
dante rearranges the milk
randal joins him
let me borrow your car
i dont want to talk to you
just lend me your car
why should i loan you my car
i want to rent a movie
pause you want to rent a movie
dante walks away shaking his head
whats that for
you work in a video store
they head back to the counter
i work in a shitty video store
i want to go to a good video store so i can rent a good movie
are you open
simultaneously the customer comes to the counter
pack of cigarettes
pets cat cute cat
whats its name
the customer lets it sink in and then leaves in a huff
dante puts up cigarettes
can you imagine being halfway decent to the customers at least some of the time
let me borrow your car
calmer may i be blunt with you
if you must
we are employees of quick stop convenience and rst video respectively
as such we have certain responsibilities which though it may seem cruel and unusual does include manning our posts until closing
so playing hockey and attending wakes these practices are standard operating procedure
theres a difference
those were obligations
obligations that could not have been met at any later date
now renting videos thats just gratuitous not to mention illogical considering you work in a video store
another customer leans in
are you open
rolls his eyes yes
you know what
i dont think i care for you rationale
its going to have to do for now considering that its my car thats up for request
to customer can i help you
pack of cigarettes
whats your point
my point is that youre a clerk paid to do a job
you cant just do anything you want while youre working
reading tabloid space alien revealed as head of time warner reports stock increase
to dante and randal they print any kind of shit in these papers
they certainly do
two fifty five
so your argument is that title dictates behavior
the reasons you wont let me borrow your care is because i have a title and a job description and im supposed to follow it right
interjecting i saw one one time that said the world was ending the next week
then in the next weeks paper they said we were miraculously saved at the zero hour by a koala fish mutant bird
eyes the customer annoyed so im no more responsible for my own decisions while im here at work than say the death squad soldiers in bosnia
thats stretching it
youre not being asked to slay children or anything
sips water again with the interjections and i remember this one time the damn paper said
randal spits a mist of water at the customer drenching him
the man reacts violently attempting to grab randal from over the counter
randal makes no move but remains untouched
dante plays block
sir im sorry
he didnt mean it
he was trying to get me
well he missed
let me refund your cigarette money and well call it even
considerably calmer takes money this is the last time i ever come here
to randal and if i ever see you again im gonna break your fucking head open
the customer leaves wiping water from his face
randal salutes him
angrily what the fuck did you do that for
two reasons one i hate when the people cant shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines
and two to make a point title does not dictate behavior
if title dictated my behavior as a clerk serving the public i wouldnt be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy
but i did so my point is that people dictate their own behavior
hence even though im a clerk in this video store i choose to go rent videos at big choice
extends opened palm agreed
shakes his head hands over keys youre a danger to both the dead and the living
i like to think im a master of my own destiny
please get the hell out of here
i know im your hero
dante waits on a customer trainer
he lifts the gallon of milk into a paper bag letting out a slight grunt
sounds to me like somebody needs to hit the gym
i heard you strain when you put the milk in the bag
that milk only weighs about seven pounds
i didnt strain
i dont think so
that was a grunt a deep inhalation of oxygen to aid in the stretching of muscles
im a trainer
i know what that sound signifies youre out of shape
i dont think so
oh i do
you made the same noise when you reached across the counter for my cash
your muscles are thin and sadly underutilized
they are not
yes they are
youre out of shape
what are you talking about
theres no fat on this body
no fat but no tone either
you dont get enough exercise
a female customer heather leans in the doorway
are you open
grabs a paper just the paper
to heather thirty fire
to heather let me ask you a question do you think this guys out of shape
studies dante i dont know
i cant really tell from here
i am not
how much can you bench
i dont know
studying dante id say about sixty seventy tops
i know i can bench more than that
i think the lady called it
my ex boyfriend was about his height but he was much bulkier
he could bench two fifty three hundred easy
i do about three fifty four
rolling up sleeve feel that
now feel his
to dante roll up your sleeve chief
oh for gods sake
you know youre out of shape
take my card
i can help you tone that body up in no time
get you on an aerobics and free weights program
a suited man carrying a notebook comes to the counter
to man yes
to trainer im not out of shape
excuse me but have you been here all day
still studying dante hes got those love handles
to heather i dont have love handles
were you working here at about four oclock
ive been here since six oclock this morning
to heather its probably from being around all this food every day
oh i know
if i had to work here all day id be bloated and out of shape too
im not out of shape
can i have your name please
what is this about
the suited man scribbles in his notebook
youre dante hicks
oh my god
i didnt even recognize you
because hes out of shape
do i know you
you remember alyssa jones
she hung out with
im her sister
youre alyssas sister
i remember you got caught in my parents room with caitlin once
did you say caitlin bree
pretty girl about this girls height dark hair gorgeous body
and your name is dante hicks
you went to high school with her
you played hockey
how do you know that
hey you still going out with her
no shes getting married
to an asian design major
to dante dont take this the wrong way but i used to fuck her
while you two were dating in high school
were talking four five years ago back when i drove a trans am
oh my god
youre rick derris
you know him
caitlin used to talk about him all the time
you were the built older guy with the black trans and the big
wait a second
to trainer you used to sleep with caitlin bree
while i was dating her
all the time
that girl was like a rabbit
i dont believe this
to trainer i still remember caitlin telling us about that time you two went to that motel the one with the mirrors and the hot tub in the room
she told you about that
to dante buddy of mine worked there
said he watched the whole thing
they used to film people at that hotel nobody knew about it
she said one time you set up a tent on the beach and you guys did it in the middle of this big rainstorm
when did all this shit happen
hey man that was a long time ago
dont let it get to you
im surprised you never found out about it dante
everybody in school knew even in my class
jesus christ what next
the suited man rips a piece of paper out of his notebook and hands it to dante
here you go
a fine for five hundred dollars
five hundred bucks
for violation of new jersey statute section two a number one seventy slash fifty one any person who sells or makes available tobacco or tobacco related products to persons under
the age of eighteen is regarded as disorderly
what are you talking about
according to the njac the new jersey administrative code section eighteen five slash twelve point five a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be
leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor
i didnt do that
you said you were here all day
yeah but i didnt sell cigarettes to any kids
an angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at quick stop convenience sold her five year old daughter cigarettes today at around four
division of taxation calls the state board of health and they send me down here to issue a fine
you say you were working all day hence the fine is yours
its doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child
but i didnt sell cigarettes to any kid
to a five year old kid
what a scumbag
thats sick dante
i didnt sell cigarettes to any kids
the due date is on the bottom
this summons cannot be contested in any court of law
failure to remit before the due date will result in a charge of criminal negligence and a warrant will be issued for your arrest
have a nice day
the suited man exits with dante trying to follow
but i didnt sell cigarettes to any kids
takes back the card forget it
i dont want to deal with a guy that sells cigarettes to a five year old
to heather can i offer you a ride somewhere
how about the beach
i like the way you think
the two exit
dante alone studies his summons
he rubs his forehead
dante spins angrily
his expression softens
jay deals with a customer as silent bob looks on
thats the price my brother
yo i dont have that kind of cash
for this kind of hash you need that kind of cash
how long you gonna be here
then im going to john ks party
youre gonna be at john ks party
to silent bob my man is deaf
yelling quieter neh
yo dont sell all that
cause im gonna get the cash and buy it from you at john ks
youre gonna bring it right
the only place i dont bring my drugs is church
and that aint till sunday morning
ill see you at that party
puts his hand up to be slapped ill see you there
reluctantly slapping hands ill see you there
jay turns to silent bob
its motherfuckers like that who give recreational drug users a bag name
suddenly spotting someone o
dante and caitlin are embracing very tightly
we hold on them for a few seconds just to let it sink in
when did you get back
i havent seen you since
he hugs her again dante
youve got a customer
dante hops behind the counter
a customer pays for something while dante continues to talk
i just saw alyssas little sister outside
she was with rick derris
lets not talk about that
howd you get home
it took eight hours
i cant believe youre here
another customer comes to the counter
excuse me do you have
to customer to the back above the oil
to caitlin how long are you staying
then i have to take the train back
yet another customer comes to the counter
pack of cigarettes
to caitlin congratulations
i saw that announcement in todays paper
to dante shes marrying an asian design major
so im told
jay and silent bob lean against the wall
man its fucking slow
silent bob walks out of the frame leaving jay alone against the wall
he comes back a few seconds later carrying a mini walkman with ten watt speakers
he sets it down on the ground and turns it on
house music starts playing
jay possessed by the beat breaks into an impromptu dance in which he makes suggestive and often lewd moves
silent bob leans against the wall
youre just going to lock the store like that
i want to talk to you about something and i dont want to be disturbed
you saw it
very dramatic i thought
its not what you think
what its worse
youre pregnant with an asian design majors child
im not pregnant
were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation
i was going to tell you
but then we were getting along so well i didnt want to mess it up
you couldve broke it to me gently you know at least started by telling me you had a boyfriend
i told you i have a girlfriend
i know im sorry
but when we started talking
its like i forgot i had a boyfriend
and then he proposed last month
and you said yes
kind of sort of
is that what they teach you at that school of yours
kind of sort of
everyone knows about this except me
do you know how humiliating that is
i wouldve told you and you would have stopped calling like a baby
how do you know that
because i know you
you prefer drastic measures to rational ones
so youre really getting married
no youre not really getting married
the story goes like this he proposed and i told him i had to think about it and he insisted i wear the ring anyway
then my mother told the paper we were engaged
how like her
then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper
thats when i hopped the train to come back here because i knew youd be a wreck
thanks for the vote of confidence
was i right
wreck is a harsh term
disturbed is more like it
mildly disturbed even
i love a macho facade
its such a turn on
sniffing air what smells like shoe polish
and you came here to what
to comfort me
the last thing i needed was for you to think i was hiding something from you
but you were
no i wasnt
i told youd id been seeing other people
yeah but not seriously
christ youre ready to walk down the aisle id say that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody
im giving him his ring back
i dont want to marry him
i dont want to get married now
im on the verge of graduation
i want to go to grad school after this
and then i want to start a career
i dont want to be a wife first and then have to worry about when i going to fit in all of the other stuff
ive come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife
and i know thats what id become
sangs already signed with a major firm and hes going to be pulling a huge salary which would give me no reason to work and hes so traditional anyway
his name is a past tense
hes a nice guy
if hes so nice why arent you going to marry him
i just told you
theres more isnt there
hicks whatever do you mean
tell me i dont have something to do with it
you dont have anything to do with it
look how full of yourself you are
i just believe in giving credit where credit is due
and i believe that im the impetus behind your failure to wed
if im so nuts about you then why am i having sex with an asian design major
jesus youre caustic
i had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on
when i say i dont want to get married i mean just that
i dont want to marry anybody
not for years
so whos asking
i dont want to marry you
stay in that frame of mind
buy can we date
im sure sang and veronica
would like that
we could introduce them
they might hit it off
you want to date again
i would like to be your boyfriend yes
its just the shock of seeing me after three years
believe me youll get over it
give me a bit more credit
i think its time we got back together you know
im more mature youre more mature youre finishing college im already in the job market
you work in a market all right
tell me you wouldnt want to go out again
after all the talking weve been doing
the key word here is talk dante
i think the idea the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date
so we should just make pretend over the phone that were dating
i dont know
maybe we should just see what happens
let me take you out tonight
you mean on a date
a real date
dinner and a movie
the dante hicks dinner and a movie date
i think ive been on that one before
you have a better suggestion
how about the caitlin bree walk on the boardwalk then get naked somewhere kind of private date
i hear thats a rather popular date
hits him jerk
here i am throwing myself at you succumbing to your wily charms and you call me a slut in so many words
what about sing
hes not invited
hes your fiance
i offer you my body and you offer me semantics
hes just a boyfriend dante and in case you havent gotten the drift of why i came all the way here from ohio im about to become single again
and yes let me placate your ego you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision for which ill probably be ostracized at both school and home
you ask me who i choose i choose you
so what are you saying
youre such an asshole
im just kidding
i can already tell this isnt going to work
ill ask randal to close up for me when he gets back
whered he go
id have thought hed be at your side like an obedient lapdog
he went to rent a movie but he hasnt gotten back yet
ah screw it ill just lock the store up and leave him a note
youre too responsible
i have to go home first
they dont even know i left school
and i should break the disengagement news to my mother which is going to cause quite a row considering she loves sang
well me i guess
gathering herself to go so i shall take my leave of you but i will return in a little while at which time yes i would love to go for
dinner and a movie with you
what happened to the walk and the nakedness
im easy but im not that easy
she kisses his cheek see you later handsome
dante watches her leave
he then explodes in jubilance
dante looks ahead dreamily half spinning in his chair
randal enters carrying videos
get to work
takes videos whatd you rent
reads best of both worlds
starlets with both organs
you should see the box beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame
and this is what you rented
i like to expand my horizons
i got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor
five hundred dollars
dante hands him the summons
randal reads it
i didnt think they even enforced this
points to himself living proof
i thought you never sold cigarettes to kids
i dont you did
maybe five years old
taken aback holy shit
as opposed to the hundreds of other children you let buy cigarettes whenever you work here
then how come you got the fine
because im here
incredulous youre lying
i couldnt make this kind of hell up
then why arent you like screaming at me right now
because im happy
youre happy to get a fine
im happy because caitlin came to see me
now i know youre lying
she just left
what did she say
shes not going to marry that guy
she went home to tell her mother
takes it in for a moment wow
youve had quite an evening
she went home shes getting ready and were going out
i feel so ineffectual
is there anything i can do for you
watch the store while i go home and change
what happened to title dictates behavior
this is my way of spitting water at life
suddenly aware hey what about veronica
dont bring it up
i dont want to think about that now
let me enjoy this hour of bliss
ill think about all of that later
in the meantime nobody mentions the v word
youre a snake
in my absence try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns
you want me to bring the vcr over here so we can watch this
i might be leaving early to go out with caitlin in which case youll have to close the store tonight
all right but youre missing out
chicks with dicks
puts cats on counter ill read the book
a customer comes back to the counter
he pets the cat
whats his name
jay and silent bob watch as dante passes
a small group of burners are poised around the store door
jay carefully writes on a large piece of paper using a thick marker
silent bob hands him the scissors
jay slowly cuts the large piece of paper
silent bob hands him the tape
jay snaps off a few pieces and plasters the sign to the convenience store door
it is a large word balloon and it reads i eat cock
once in place he raps on the window
randal looks out his face adjacent to the word balloon making it appear as if he is saying he eats cock
the small group laughs hysterically
caitlin enters carrying an overnight bag
randal is watching his porno
the porno is loud and lewd
randal graves scourge of the video renter
ladies and gentleman mrs
asian design major herself caitlin bree
you saw that article
god isnt it awful
my mother sent that in
i take it she likes the guy
youd think she was marrying him
what are you watching
what did your mom say when you told her you werent engaged anymore
she said not to come home until graduation
wow you got thrown out
what can i say
he does weird things to me
can i watch
you can hold me down
can i join in
you might be let down
im not a hermaphrodite
so what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with dante this time around
a womans intuition
something in me says its time to give the old boy a serious try
hey i was just about to order some dinner
you eat chinese right
so where is he
he went home to change for the big date
god isnt he great
indicating tv no this is great
can i use the bathroom
theres no light back there
why arent there any lights
well there are but for some reason they stop working at five fourteen every night
nobody can figure it out
and the boss doesnt want to pay the electrician to fix it because the electrician owes money to the video store
such a sordid state of affair
and im caught in the middle torn between my loyalty for the boss and my desire to piss with the light on
ill try to manage
she heads toward the back
cautionary break his heart again this time and ill kill you
youre very protective of him randal
you always have been
he was mine first
rubs his head awww
that was so cute
she kisses his forehead and walks away
the mother and small child happy scrappy come to the counter
oblivious of the tv a pack of cigarettes
the small child points at the tv screen
randal studies the i eat cock word balloon
who eats cock
bunch of savages in this town
recalling hey caitlins in the back
you might want to see if shes okay shes been back there a long time
theres no lights back there
i told her that
she said she didnt need any
why dont you join her man
make a little bathroom bam bam
i love your sexy talk
kindergarten poo poo wee wee
the cooler down is heard opening
caitlin walks lazily down the convenience store aisle
she looks very satisfied
dante and randal regard her curiously
she joins them latching on to dantes arm lovingly
howd you get here so fast
i left like an hour ago
regards him curiously do you always talk weird after you violate women
randal and dante stare at caitlin confused
maybe the asian design major slipped her some opium
hugging dante promise me itll always be like that
when you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything
am i missing something here
i went back there and dante was already waiting for me
it was so cool
he didnt say a word
he was just
ready you know
and we didnt kiss or talk or anything
he just sat there and let me do all the work
to dante you dog
i didnt see you go back there
dante is bewildered
and the fact that there werent any lights made it so
she lets out a growl and hugs dante god
that was so great
quietly it wasnt me
laughing it off yeah right
who was it randal
to randal was it you
i was here the whole time
half laughing you two better quit it
beat we didnt just have sex in the bathroom
everyone is silent
this isnt funny
im not kidding
i just got back from outside
covering her chest this isnt fucking funny dante
im not fooling around
to randal who went back there
i feel nauseous
are you sure somebody was back there
hits dante i didnt just fuck myself
jesus im going to be sick
you just fucked a total stranger
shut the fuck up
i cant believe this
i feel faint
to randal call the police
theres a strange man in our bathroom and he just raped caitlin
weakly oh god
she said she did all the work
the old mans face is serene almost happy as he lies on a stretcher
same old man who took a porn mag to the bathroom
who is he
the body bag zipper is pulled closed
dante the coroner and randal stand around the stretcher bound body bag
the coroner takes notes
i dont know
he just came in and asked to use the bathroom
what time was this
i dont know
to randal what time did hockey end
around three or something
what time did we go to the funeral
i think four
wait a second
who was working here today
i thought you just said you played hockey and went to a funeral
then who operated the store
it was closed
with this guy locked in
everything happened at once
i guess i forgot he was back there
ambulance attendants join them
can we take this now
the stretcher is wheeled out
midway down the body bag something protrudes pushing the bag up
it is an erection
randal stares at it
was he alive when
i place the time of death at about three twenty
then how could she
the body can maintain an erection after expiration
sometimes for hours
did he have the adult magazine when he came in
i gave it to him
randal and the coroner stare in disbelief
well he asked me for it
continuing i cant say for certain until we get him back to the lab but my guess is he was masturbating his heart seized and he died
thats when the girl found him
sniffing the air something smells like shoe polish
to coroner this has gotta be the weirdest thing youve ever been called in on
writing actually i once had to tag a kid that broke his neck trying to put his mouth on his penis
randal looks down anonymously
what about caitlin
shes going to need years of therapy after this
my question is how did she come to have sex with the dead man
she thought it was me
the coroner stares at dante
what kind of convenience store do you run here
dante and randal stare at the floor
beat do you think he was talking about my cousin
caitlin sits in the back of the ambulance a blanket draped over her shoulders
an attendant takes her blood pressure
the doors are closed and the vehicle speeds away
jay and silent bob lean against the wall
jay eats sugar out of a box
i knew one of those motherfuckers was gonna kill somebody one day
a jar of salsa is invaded by a large corn chip
once in the condiment the corn chip resembles a surfacing shark fin
fingers poke at it bringing it to life swimming menacingly to and fro across the jar
mumbling jaws theme da dum
da dante and randal are on a freezer case
randal pushes this chip around the jar of salsa
dante stares up at the ceiling oblivious
dante says nothing
as brody were gonna need a bigger boat
dante says even less than nothing
as quint man goes into the cage cage goes into the salsa sharks in the salsa our shark
whats with you
you havent said anything for like twenty minutes
what the hell is your problem
why do i have this life
have some chips youll feel better
im stuck in this pit earning less than slave wages working on my day off dealing with every backward fuck on the planet the goddam steel shutters are locked all
day i smell like shoe polish ive got an ex girlfriend whos catatonic after fucking a dead guy and my present girlfriend has sucked thirty six dicks
my life is in the shitter right about now so if you dont mind id like to stew a bit
randal hops off the freezer case and steps o
thats all bullshit
you know what the real problem here is
i was born
randal comes back
you should shit or get off the pot
i should shit or get off the pot
yeah you should shit or get off the pot
what are you talking about
im talking about this thing you have
this inability to improve your situation in life
youll sit there and blame life for dealing a cruddy hand never once accepting the responsibility for the way your situation is
all right if you hate this job and the people and the fact that you have to come in on your day off then quit
as if its that easy
you just up and quit
there are other jobs and they pay better money
youre bound to be qualified for at least one of them
so whats stopping you
leave me alone
this is a life of convenience for you and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm youve fashioned for yourself
oh like your lifes any better
im satisfied with my situation for now
you dont hear me bitching
you on the other hand have been bitching all day
why dont you go back to the video store
its the same thing with veronica
leave her out of this
you date veronica because shes low maintenance and because its convenient
meanwhile all you ever do is talk about caitlin
you carry a torch for a girl you dated in high school in high school for gods sake
youre twenty two
leave me alone
if you want caitlin then face veronica tell her and be with caitlin
if you want veronica be with veronica
but dont pine for one and fuck the other
man if you werent such a fucking coward
if i wasnt such a fucking coward
chuckles it must be so great to be able to simplify everything the way you do
am i right or what
things happened today okay
things that probably ruined my chances with caitlin
the dead guy
shell get over fucking the dead guy
shit my moms been fucking a dead guy for thirty years i call him dad
caitlin and i cant be together
melodrama coming from you seems about as natural as an oral bowel movement
what do you want me to say
yes i suppose some of the things youre saying may be true
but thats the way things are its not going to change
make them change
i cant all right
jesus would you leave me alone
i cant make changes like that in my life
if i could i would but i dont have the ability to risk comfortable situations on the big money and the fabulous prizes
whore you kidding
you can so
christ i cant
so youll continue being miserable all the time just because you dont have the guts to face change
sadly my mother told me once that when i as three my potty lid was closed and instead of lifting it i chose to shit my pants
point is im not the kind of person that disrupts things in order to shit comfortably
dante crosses o
randal appears contemplative
dante repairs ripped dollar bills taping them back together
jay enters with silent bob and claps his hands
singing noinch noinch noinch smoking weed smoking weed
to dante a pack of wraps my good man
its time to kick back drink some beers and smoke some weed
done poisoning the youth for the day
hell yes whatever that means
now im gonna head over to atlantic drink some beers get ripped and please god get laid
pulls out money e z wider one and a halfs
one seventy nine
to silent bob pay the good man
to dante dont you close soon
a half hour
we get off about the same time every night
we should hang out
you get high
i should start
wanna come to this party tonight
theres gonna be some pussy there man
i dont think so
listen to you
oh i dont hang out with drug dealers
silent bob hands weed to jay
i work just like you
youre more of a crook than i am dude
how do you figure
you cant roll a joint in here
rolling a joint relax brother
what i mean is that you sell the stuff in this store at the highest prices around
a dollar seventy nine for wraps whats that shit
its not my store
and these arent my drugs i just sell them
the difference is you exploit a weakness
whats that mean
you sell to people that cant stay away from an addiction
how much is pepsi here
a dollar sixty nine plus tax
at food city its ninety nine cents plus tax
so why do you sell it for so much more
ill tell you why because people come here and theyre like a dollar eighty for soda
i should get it at food city
but i dont feel like driving there
ill just buy it here so i dont have to drive up there
thats exploiting a weakness too isnt it
i cant believe you just rolled a joint in here
hey man what happened with that old guy
he died in the bathroom
thats fucked up
yo i heard he was jerkin off
i dont know
i wasnt watching
probably saw that caitlin chick
i know i felt like beatin it when i saw her
pantomimes sex come here bitch
you like this
is this what you want
knock it off
that used to be my girlfriend
you used to go out with her
we were going to start again i think
dont you already have a girlfriend
is she that girl whos down here all the time
she came here today carrying a plate of food
and what you were gonna dump her to date that caitlin chick
i dont know dude
that caitlin chicks nice
but i see that veronica girl doing shit for you all the time
she brings you food she rubs your back
didnt i see her change your tire one day
i jacked the car up
all she did was loosen the nuts and put the tire on
she sure goes out of her way
shes my girlfriend
ive had girlfriends but all they wanted from me was weed and shit
beat shit my grandma used to say which is better a good plate with nothing on it
i fucked up
she said whats a good looking plate with nothing on it
i dont know
she was senile and shit
used to piss herself all the time
cmon silent bob
silent bob stands there
you know theres a million fine looking women in the world but they dont all bring you lasagne at work
most of them just cheat on you
silent bob leaves
dante shuts his eyes tightly and rubs the bridge of his nose with his thumb and forefinger as if in deep concentration
he suddenly snaps his eyes open
nearly surprised hes right
i love her
randal has a heart to heart with veronica
so thats it
he doesnt love you anymore
he loves caitlin
veronica stares dumbfounded
he told you all of this
all except the latent homosexuality part thats just my theory
i dont know what to say
dont hold it against him
he just never got caitlin out of his system
its not your fault
beat i dont know thing one about chicks
do you want to cry or something
i can leave
im not sad
no im more furious
im pissed off
i feel like hes been killing time while he tries to grow the balls to tell me how he really feels and then he cant even do it
he has his friend do it for him
he didnt ask me to
after all that ive done for that fuck
and he wants to be with that slut
he can have his slut
um do you think you can give me a lift home tonight
oblivious of randal im going to have a word with that asshole
veronica storms out
i dont think
randal stares after her
a customer stands nearby
to customer what am i worried about
hell probably be glad i started the ball rolling
all he ever did was complain about her anyway
im just looking out for his best interests
i mean thats what a friend does am i right
i did him a favor
sees box on counter oooh
dante is on the ground holding his knee
veronica stands above him
what the fuck did you do that for
if you didnt want to go out with me anymore why didnt you just say it
instead you pussyfoot around and see that slut behind my back
whatre you talking about
kicks him youve been talking to her on the phone for weeks
it was only a few times
and then you pull that shit this morning freaking out because ive gone down on a couple guys
throws purse at him im not the one trying to patch things up with my ex sneaking around behind your back
and if you think that thirty seven dicks are a lot then just wait mister im going to put the hookers in times square to shame with all the guys
i go down on now
would you let me explain
how you were waiting until the time was right and then you were going to dump me for her
getting up veronica
its not like that anymore
i mean it was never really like that
veronica kicks him in the other leg
dante goes down yelling in pain
youre damn right its not like that
because i wont let it be like that
you want your slut
the slut is yours
i dont want caitlin
you dont know what you want but im not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out
ive encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school to take charge of your life and find direction
i even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if i was with you
everyone said it was a stupid move but i didnt care because i loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk youve been in
since that whore dumped you oh so many years ago
and now you want to go back to her so she can fuck you over some more
i dont want to go back with her
of course not not now
youre caught and now youre trying to snake out of doing what you wanted to do
well i wont let you
i want you to follow through on this just so you can find out what a fucking idiot you are
and when she dumps you again and she will dante i promise you that when she dumps you again i want to laugh at you right in your face just
so you realize that that was what you gave up our relationship for
grabs her purse im just glad randal had the balls to tell me since you couldnt
and having him tell me
that was just the weakest move ever
veronica i love you
dante lies on the floor alone
randal exits and locks the door behind him
tight on randals face as he steps inside
hands clasp around his throat and yank him out of the frame
dante throttles randal choking him to the ground
randal throws his fists into dantes midriff throwing him back into the magazine rack
randal jumps to his feet as dante comes at him again
randal tumbles into the cakes as entenmans products scatter beneath and around him
he grabs a pound cake and hits dante in the head with it using the opportunity to scurry down the middle aisle
dante leaps at his feet and randal grabs the shelves knocking aspirin over until randal shrieking sprays something in dantes face
dante paws at his eyes
randal grabs italian bread and smacks it into dantes face as he rushes him blindly
dante chases him out of the frame
m ms scatter wildly across the empty floor and the ruckus is heard o
dante and randal later out of breath on the floor
randal sits up against the candy rack rubbing his neck
dante lies on the floor bacon held against a sort of crushed cookies ripped open candies broken bread and other damaged goods
hows your eye
reluctantly the swellings not so bad
but the fds stings
then hows your neck
its hard to swallow
they are both silent
you didnt have to choke me
why the fuck did you tell veronica that i was going to dump her for caitlin
i thought i was doing you a favor
you were saying how you couldnt initiate change yourself so i figured id help you out
you still didnt have to choke me
im surprised i didnt kill you
why do you say that
why do i say that
what did i do that was so wrong
what dont you do
randal sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable
how do you figure
what time did you get to work today
like ten after
you were over half an hour late
then all you do is come over here
to talk to you
which means the video store is ostensibly closed
its not like im miles away
unless youre out renting videos at other video stores
i rented it so we could watch it together
you get my slapped with a fine you fight with the customers and i have to patch everything up
you get us chased out of a funeral by violating a corpse
to top it all off you ruin my relationship
whats your encore
do you anally rape my mother while pouring sugar in my gas tank
sighs you know what the real tragedy is
im not even supposed to be here today
suddenly outraged fuck you
fuck you pal
listen to you trying to pass the buck again
im the source of all your misery
who closed the store to play hockey
who closed the store to attend a wake
who tried to win back an ex girlfriend without even discussing how he felt with his present one
you wanna blame somebody blame yourself
beat as dante im not even supposed to be here today
whips stuff at dante you sound like an asshole
whose choice was it to be here today
nobody twisted your arm
youre here today of your own violation my friend
but youd like to believe that the weight of the world rests on your shoulders that the store would crumble if dante wasnt here
well i got news for you jerk this store would survive without you
without me either
all you do is overcompensate for having whats basically a monkeys job you push fucking buttons
any moron can waltz in here and do our jobs but youre obsessed with making it seem so much more fucking important so much more epic than it really is
you work in a convenience store dante
and badly i might add
and i work in a shitty video store
badly as well
beat you know that guy jays got it right he has no delusions about what he does
we like to make ourselves seem so much better than the people that come in here just looking to pick up a paper or god forbid cigarettes
we look down on them as it were so advanced
well if were so fucking advanced then what are we doing working here
randal gets up leaving dante to contemplate his strong words alone
dante and randal silently clean up backs to each other
dante places a mop in the corner
randal pulls on his coat
i threw out the stuff that got broken
the floor looks clean
you need a ride
looks out door got one
just pulled up
they stand in silence
do you work tomorrow
what about you
im calling out
going to hit the hospital see how caitlin is
then try to see veronica
you wanna grab something to eat tomorrow night
after i get out of here
ill call you
let you know
good luck with veronica
if you want i can talk to her you know and explain
ill take care of it
weve got a lot of shit to talk about
to say the least
do you need a hug or something
cause i would have no hang ups about hugging you
you know you being a guy and all
just dont knead my ass when you do it
get the fuck outta here already
ill talk to you tomorrow
a second later he reenters and tosses dante the sheet sign
dante pushes the sign over from open to closed
dante climbs behind the counter
he pops the register open and starts counting the drawer out
the door is heard opening
pov john dante counting out the register not looking up
whatd you forget something
looks up surprised oh
im sorry were closed
a gunshot blasts out
dante flies back his chest exploding
he stares ahead and slumps to the floor
john walks behind the counter stepping over dantes body on the floor and takes the money out of the register
he grabs a paper bag and jams the money in it
he grabs handfuls of change shoves it in his pocket and then quickly exits the frame
dante continues to lie on the floor
credits end and the door is heard opening
a customer comes to the counter and stands there
he waits looks around for a clerk looks down the aisles
he looks around again and glances at the door to make sure nobodys coming in
then he reaches behind the counter and grabs a pack of cigarettes
