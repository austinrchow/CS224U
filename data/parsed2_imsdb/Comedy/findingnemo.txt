finding nemo transcript v
copyright walt disney pictures pixar animation studios transcribed by bad burn email markgonzalez
com okay this is the work in progress finding nemo film transcript
why is it work in progress you might ask
well for one this isnt a accurate transcript some words might be missing may not be right
second some lines may or may not have been spoken by the right character
there are instances in the film where a line is spoken but the character isnt on screen which makes things complicated
but id say this transcript is about accurate
dialogue for each scene is seperated by a line of equal signs
this transcript is open for corrections additions if you have any
what you cant do however is to edit it and take credit for it
although i do not own the movie or its screenplay this transcript was made with no intention of copyright infringement and the like

i was a little vague on the details
so where are you going
well you see my son was taken
my son was taken away from me
gasp no way
no no no kids
i dont wanna talk about it
sighs well okay
i live on this reef a long long way from here
this is gonna be good i can tell
and my son nemo see he was mad at me
and maybe he wouldnt have done it if i hadnt been so tough on him i dont know
anyway he swam out in the open water to this boat and when he was out there these divers appeared and i tried to stop them but the boat was
so we swam out in the ocean to follow them
they couldnt stop them
and then nemos dad he swims out to the ocean and they bump into
three ferocious sharks
he scares away the sharks by blowin them up
golly thats amazing
and then dives thousands of
feet straight down into the dark
its like wicked dark down there you can see a thing
hows it goin bob
and the only thing that they can see down there
is the light from this big horrible creature with razor sharp teeth
nice parry old man
and then he has to blast his way
so these two little fish have been
searching the ocean for days
on the east australian current
which means that he may be on his way here right now
that should put them in sydney
harbor in a matter of days
i mean it sounds like this guys gonna stop at
nothing until he finds his son
i sure hope he makes it
thats one dedicated father if you ask me
oh would you just shut up
youre rats with wings
blokes been lookin for his boy nemo
he was taken off the reef by divers and this
there take it
hey hey hey
say that again
you said something about nemo

last i heard hes headin towards the harbor
sighs is he doing okay
i dont know but whatever you do dont mention d a r
its okay i know who youre talking about
im sorry i couldnt stop the no im the one who should be sorry
i was so ready to get out so ready to taste that ocean
i was willing to put you in harms way to get there

are you sure
what was his name
some sort of sportfish or something tuna uh trout
the little clownfish from the reef
its my dad
he took on a shark
i heard he took on three
thats gotta be forty eight hundred teeth
you see kid after you were taken by diver dan over there your dad followed the boat you were on like a maniac
hes swimming and hes swimming and hes giving it all hes got and then three gigantic sharks capture him and he blows them up
and then dives thousands of feet and gets chased by a monster with huge teeth
he ties this demon to a rock and what does he get for a reward
he gets to battle an entire jellyfish forest
and now hes riding with a bunch of sea turtles on the east australian current and the word is hes headed this way right now to sydney
