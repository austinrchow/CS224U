screenplay by david s
ward titles end and we widen to reveal that the black b
is actually the sludge clogged surface of the cuyahoga river
we tilt up from the river to reveal the city of cleveland then follow with a series of shots of cleveland landmarks
three men in cleveland indian baseball caps sit at the counter
bobby james year old grad student vic bolito year old telephone worker and johnny wynn year old house painter
thelma gordon year old waitress delivers their breakfast
spring training starts the twelfth
how do you think the indians will do this year
they dont look too good
the other two shake their heads in contemplation of this sorry fact
a year old business executive is talking to a fellow club member over lunch
they dont look particularly good do they
two longshoremen are talking while they unload a freighter
ill tell ya
they dont look very fuckin good
down on the field two korean groundskeepers speak korean as they resod the outfield
in subtitles theyre shitty
we tilt up from the field to a glass enclosed area on the third deck
its the cleveland indians conference room
three men are seated around the table charlie donovan
the manager phil butler public relations head jerry simmons operations director and lyle matthews director of player personnel donovan taps his pencil impatiently obviously waiting for somebody
checking his watch thirty minutes late
think shell show
shes got to
shes the damn owner now
she didnt last week
she was having a guava facial
as butler tries to figure out what a guava facial is the conference room doors swing open and a muscular male secretary bodyguard enters clearing the way for mrs
rachel phelps a flashy striking woman in her early forties
despite the designer clothes she favors there is the hint of something less refined about her
she carries a pekinese dog cha cha on her left hip
good morning gentlemen
welcome to another season of indians baseball
the men applaud but their hearts are barely in it
the secretary bodyguard pulls out a chair at the head of the table and rachel sits
i know that it may not seem the same without donald here this year but i promise you by the end of the season this team will have made history
several eyes roll up around the room
picking up a newspaper unfortunately there are some in the press who feel that
reading from the page the ex showgirl wife of donald phelps has no business being the owner of a major league baseball team
rachel crumbles the paper and throws it away
obviously donald didnt feel that way or he wouldnt have left the team to me
and i was more than showgirl
i was a dancer
now i know some of you have doubts about my ability to run this franchise
god help you if i ever find out about it
this causes a few nervous glances in the room
spring training begins in two weeks
throwing a sheet of paper on the table heres the list of people well be inviting to camp this year
donovan butler and simmons pour over the list
i could sit here and tell you what a great year were gonna have but the facts are we lost the two best players we had to free agency
we havent won a pennant in years
we havent even finished in the first division for
obviously its time to make some changes
what do ya think
i never heard of half these guys
and the ones i do know are way past their prime
most of these guys never had a prime
pointing to the sheet this guy here is dead
cross him off then
under his breath lets not be hasty
its time to shake things up charlie
clear the board and start over
well its not the best material ive ever had to work with but ill do my best to see we move up a notch this year
i know you will charlie
thats why im movin you up to general manager
rachel sticks out her hand
donovan shakes it somewhat feebly bewildered by this whole development
well that should do it for today
thank you gentlemen
lets get to work
with that rachel gets up and breezes out of the room with her entourage leaving donovan and the others dumbfounded
checking his watch one minute seconds
donovan carrying a boxful of belongings under each arm pushes open the door of his new office and walks inside
the basic outfitting is masculine enough but the room is full of feminine little accents flowers in vases porcelain desk accessories etc
donovan is slightly overwhelmed
suddenly theres a voice at the door
phelps would like to see you
sequence omitted from original script
donovan is ushered in by rachels male secretary
donovan carries his player roster with him
come on in charlie
have a seat
im glad you called me in
im still unclear on a couple things oh really
well if im the g
whos gonna be the manager
i was thinking of lou brown
hes managed the toledo mud hens of the international league for the last years
this is hardly an impressive credential to donovan
i think hell fit right in with our team concept
what exactly is our team concept
thats what i wanted to talk to you about
i want to put together a team that will help us relocate to miami
what do you mean
referring to the roster some of these guys are furniture movers
im serious about this charlie
its no secret ive never liked cleveland much
the weathers lousy downtown is a pit the stadiums falling apart and we cant draw dick
another couple of years of this and im gonna have to start feeding cha cha dog food
rachel bends down to give her dog cha cha a little love pat while donovan tries to contain his disgust
phelps you cant just up and move a team on a whim
its hardly a whim
miamis offered to build us a new stadium capacity v
boxes and no rent for the first million at the gate
plus a million dollar media guarantee percent of the concession gross all of the parking and they pick up the stadium operations costs
no other franchise in baseball can match that deal
even so the leaguell never let us leave cleveland
we got a lease with the city
the lease says we have the right to move if our attendance falls below for the year
pushing across a copy of the lease paragraph line
donovan looks at it the paragraph highlighted in yellow
if we play bad enough we should be able to come in under that
what are you saying
you want us to lose
no weve been losing
what i want us to do is finish dead last
donovan is stunned
he casts around helplessly for some response
mister phelps would never have approved of this
he knew it had to be done
he just didnt have the courage to do it
with veiled menace hopefully you will come to see the wisdom of it
pause if this team lives up to its potential we could have the worst record in all baseball
on donovans sunken face we go to on a stretch of deserted mexican highway
over we hear a telephone ring
the room is a total mess
the back door is off its hinges and a few chickens have wandered in
as they peck around the debris we pan the room taking in beer cans food wrappers and finally a trail of hastily discarded clothes both male and female
we reach the bed and find our hero jake taylor and with a couple days growth of stubble passed out on his face
sprawled across him asleep is a mexican woman in her late twenties
shes not great looking but at least shes overweight
taylors hand fumbles to the ringing telephone
its charlie donovan calling from his office in cleveland
we cut back and forth between the two as we will in subsequent phone scenes
this is charlie donovan new g
of the cleveland indians
i wanted to call and say the organization remembers you fondly from the years you played here and wed love to have you come to spring training for a shot
at this years club
who is this
is that you tolbert
this isnt very funny ya know
im hung over
my knees are killin me
if you were gonna pull this shit you couldve at least said you were from the yankees
taylor struggles to get a look up at the girl on top of him
still to donovan by the way you were with me last night
whos this girl on top of me
donovan is baffled by this whole line of conversation
taylor hangs up leaving donovan staring into his phone
taylor looks up to see tolbert standing in the doorway
who the hell were you talkin to
on taylors reaction we
we pick up lou brown a portly man in his early fifties making his way to his glass partitioned office
lines three and four are waiting for you mr
one guy about the tr s
picking up the phone tire world
this is charlie donovan the new g
of the cleveland indians
listen lou i hope youre sittin down cause i got an offer you probably been dreamin about your whole life
we been watchin your progress down there at toledo with a lotta interest and well
a dramatic pause how would you like to manage the indians this year
for a moment theres silence on the line then i dont know
incredulous what do ya mean you dont know
this is a chance to manage in the big leagues
lemme think it over will ya charlie
i got a guy on the other line about some whitewalls
ill talk to ya later
brown clicks off
donovan puts his head down on his desk
donovans on the phone to another player
rick we heard about your pitching out at portland last year
good looking muscular year old
sleeveless black t shirt
talking on a wall phone in a nondescript room
im ah not with them anymore
vaughn has been working sweating slightly
he takes off his cap to mop his brow revealing a radical haircut with pigtail
he sports a ring in his left ear
wed still like to take a look at ya at our spring camp in arizona march first
in the b
vaughn is on the phone
in the f
we see security bars
vaughns in a youth authority prison
yeh well im not sure i can make it by then
dont worry were gettin you out on a sort of work furlough deal
on the speaker again to lou brown
rachel watches impatient for him to close the deal
look lou you been in baseball thirty years
dont you wanna advance some
eating a sack lunch i used to coach the unwed mothers softball team
i have advanced some
rachel rubs her fingers together making the money sign to donovan
well what are you really worried about
naw im just not sure id be happy in a big organization like that
owners are always on your back tryin to help you out
i dont think thats gonna be a problem
down here baseballs a game not a business
i dont wanta be a babysitter for a buncha millionaires who think they know it all already
we dont have any millionaires
well then bonus babies or whatever you got
dont have any bonus babies either
dont you have any proven major league talent
embarrassed not that i know of
ill be up in a couple days
sounds like my kinda team
have my contracts ready
brown hangs up
to the others guess i really put the screws to him
this ones a dandy
the left field wall is a foot high solid granite outcropping
a final out is made and the teams change over
returning to the dugout at the end of the inning wondering what the hell hes doin here
taylor telephone for you
taylor goes to the phone in the clubhouse tunnel
jake charlie donovan again
oh yeh charlie look im sorry about this morning
look jake camp starts on the first
can you make it
you been stayin in shape down there
oh hell yeh i work out every day
i thought so

donovan hangs up
taylor shoots a fist in the air and we
approaching his manager
lets go taylor
luis im not gonna be playin anymore
i got a tryout in the states
leave your uniform
but i changed at the motel
leave your uniform
coming out of the stadium his bats and gloves over his shoulder
he has on his spikes and a pair of boxer shorts
taylor sits in the back seat
he has six coke bottles filled with sand strapped to his ankles
he lifts his legs up and down to strengthen his muscles
sequence omitted from original script
donovan brown and two of his coaches pepper leach pitching and duke temple hitting are on the field witnessing the arrival of their troops
first to arrive is he gets out of a taxi and goes to the trunk to get his bats and luggage
this looks like jake taylor
brown turns around from a conversation with temple
he was an allstar in boston wasnt he
wish we had him two years ago
four years ago then
like an army barracks
rows of bunk beds seperated by lockers
taylor walks in with temple the hitting instructor
what happened to the private rooms
were on an austerity program
this is what happens when you finish games out
back at the field supervising the arrival of more players
the first is a tall muscular latin pedro cerrano dressed in black from head to toe
he arrives on foot carrying a black suitcase and pulling a black bat case on wheels
he looks like a gunfighter coming into dodge
i think its cerrano
defected from cuba
wanted religious freedom
whats his religion
pulling into the parking lot
out steps rodger dorn high priced third baseman
brown eyes him with vague disapproval
thought you didnt have any high priced talent
sheepish i forgot about dorn cause hes only high priced
got him as a free agent three years ago
still hits the ball pretty well doesnt he
yeh he just cant field it
dorn pulls his golf clubs out of the car
well shape him up
a year old black pulling up in a vw beetle which hes got a cadillac grille on
he steps out in his shades and sharkskin suit
dont recognize this guy
hayes strolls up and introduces himself
say hey willie mays hayes here
i play like mays and run like hayes
nice to meet ya hayes
well i gotta get my stuff
hayes hustles off toward his car
i dont remember a hayes on the list
a motorcycle pulls to a stop in the lot diverting everyones attention from hayes
off steps ricky vaughn a hefty bag over his shoulder
hes still sporting his radical do
look at this fuckin guy
maybe hes the mascot
donovan is speechless
brown breaks into a small smile
yes sir this is his kinda team
taylor is putting his stuff away in a locker
vaughn enters the barracks and immediately draws the attention of dorn
hey what do we have here
guy looks like a fuckin toilet brush
i love your pony tail
and the earrings cute too
wheres the matching bracelet
vaughn whips a hard glance at dorn but keeps on walking making his way along the bunks looking for his assigned bed
its the one above taylor
vaughn unloads his duffel bag in silence
offering his hand jake taylor
vaughn shakes it and nods
so you just gonna settle for toilet brush or you got another name
forget about dorn
hes always a little tough on rookies
youll get a lot worse from other teams
the conversation is interrupted by the arrival of hayes
how ya doin
willie mays hayes here
pointing to vaughn rick vaughn
hayes doesnt quite know what to make of vaughn
what the hell league you been playin in
never heard of it
howd you wind up playin there
i stole a car
on hayes look we
three security guards with flashlights come down to the top bunk where hayes is sleeping
this guy wasnt invited to camp
they lift the bunk out of its slots and carry it out the door hayes still asleep on it
the players are dressing out in their uniforms for the first day of practice
vaughn goes in his locker and finds that a slit has been cut in the back of his cap to accommodate his pigtail
suppressed laughs are heard from several corners of the locker room
brown is addressing his troops before the first workout
welcome to spring training gentlemen
most managers tell you at this time that all the jobs are open that nobodys a lock at any position and that talent isnt everything
theyd rather see desire and discipline in a player
then they tell you that most of all they want you to have fun out there even though theyre gonna work your ass off on fundamentals and condition you till
the difference between me and those other managers is
pause i mean it
on a locker room full of uneasy faces we
hayes cot is sitting in the lot just outside the fence his suitcase set down next to it
hayes is still asleep dew on his forehead
wakened by the noise of activity on the field he sits up with a start
shit i been cut already
we pick up taylor sprinting his ass off in a yard time trial staggering across the finish line feet behind cerrano
not bad if youd fallen down
as taylor tries to catch his breath dorn and a relief pitcher named gant approach the starting line for the next trial
looking through the chain link fence surrounding the field
temple brings them to their marks and blows his whistle
dorn and gentry take off
suddenly hayes in his pajamas and bare feet comes streaking toward the starting line in hot pursuit
dorn and gentry a good yard lead but hayes is coming like a bullet
we go to slow motion as hayes draws even at the yard mark and blasts on by to win by five
this kid is fast
brown and pepper give each other the who was that masked man look
get him a uniform
the players are spread out on the field doing calisthenics counting off in unison
struggling through a series of pushups
he glances over in disbelief at vaughn and cerrano who are doing them like pistons in competition with each other
cerrano even starts doing them one handed
hayes isnt doing them at all merely pulling his head up and down while leaving his body on the ground
cmon hayes lets do em right
hey my philosophy is no pain no pain
taylor is crouched behind the plate warming up his arm
catching pitches and throwing them half speed down to second
brown drifts over
how the knees holdin up jake
never been better
no problem gettin off the throw to second
i need a catcher jake
somebody who can keep this team together on the field
you were a helluva player when you were sound but around the league they think you cant take the pounding anymore
around the league theyre wrong
im gonna have to put you to the test ya know
so i want the absolute truth here
are you percent
would i bullshit about somethin like that
walking away you better if you wanna make this team
taylor smiles and fires one full speed down to second
it bounces two feet in front of the bag
brown is watching batting practice
hayes steps into the cage and begins a preparatory ritual worthy of babe ruth rubbing dirt on his hands stretching knocking dirt off his spikes twirling the bat etc
a real sluggers routine
cmon hayes this isnt the all star game
get up to the damn plate
hayes gets in and takes his stance
on the first pitch he takes a mighty cut and hits a pop fly to the pitchers mound
we take quick cuts of the next three pitches
hayes takes prodigious swings at all of them producing three more pop ups none out of the infield
brown calls a halt
well you may run like mays but you hit like shit
my strokell come back once i get warmed up
referring to some stats never did get warmed up last year
i looked him up
i think mr
hayes shows some promise
his speed could be a big asset
aside for what
running back to the dugout
you gotta stop swingin for the fences though hayes
all youre gonna do is give yourself a hernia
with your speed you should be hittin the ball on the ground leggin em out
every time i see you hit one in the air you owe me twenty pushups
hey no problem
the next pitch comes in
hayes swings and pops it up
as he gets down to do his twenty brown turns to temple
sometimes you can teach a guy to hit
you cant teach him to run
coming over to where vaughn is tossing some casual warm up pitches to jake
all right vaughn they tell us youre a pitcher
lets see what you got
brown and pepper stand behind taylor for a better view
vaughn goes into his wind up and fires a screaming fast ball that taylor has no chance to get out of his crouch to catch
the ball rockets an inch over browns head and slams into the backstop
brown stands frozen a second contemplating his brush with eternity then turns to pepper
sounded like it
sorry lou i wasnt quite expectin that much octane
brown turns to the clubhouse man whos holding a speed gun
miles an hour
to pepper better teach him some control before he kills somebody
fielding grounders at third base
he plays them off to his left side a bit almost as if hes afraid to get bit by them
cmon dorn get in front of the damn ball
making like a bullfighter dont give me this ole bullshit
i took one of these in the eye last year
nearly lost my sight
im deeply moved
every time you play it off your hip you give me forty sit ups
thats little league shit
so is this
brown strikes an effeminate fielding position like betty grable shying from a mouse
in the batting cage knocking the cover off pitch after pitch with his black bat
jesus this guy hits a ton
how come nobody else picked up on him
to the batting practice pitcher okay harris thats enough fast balls
throw some curves
harris winds and throws a fair to middlin curve ball
cerrano swings and misses it a foot
dorn approaches brown at the cage
lou i wanna have a word with you here
whipping out his contract those penalty sit ups you want me to do
i got it right here in my contract that i dont have to do any calisthenics i dont feel are necessary
what do ya think of that
everyone around the batting cage has stopped what theyre doing to see how brown will react
brown looks at the contract a second then drops it on the ground unzips his fly and gives it a golden shower
on dorns stunned face we
doing sit ups in the infield
vaughn walks by and smiles
practically every member of the team is doing penalty calisthenics somewhere on the field
to temple we got anybody left playin baseball out there
taylor hayes and vaughn drag in looking beat from the days workout
shit the way i played today i wouldnt be surprised if they red tagged me already
what do ya mean
red tag in your locker means the manager wants to see you cause you just died and went to the minors
vaughns hand freezes on his locker latch afraid to open it now
dont worry they dont cut anybody the first day
vaughn is still not so sure
he sits down on his locker stool and glances over toward steve harris a starting pitcher whose locker is adjacent
as harris takes off his jersey we see three splotches of greasy substances on his chest just inside the button line
what is that stuff
pointing to them in order crisco bardahl vagisil
any one of em will give you another inches drop on your curve ball
vaughn cant believe this
course if its cold and i got a shirt on under my jersey i just rub a little jalapeno inside my nose and get it runnin
i need to load up the ball a little i just wipe my nose
revolted you put snot on the ball
at my age you put anything you can find on it
i havent got an arm like yours
vaughn just looks at him incredulous
taylor is undressing but his attention is diverted by cerrano whose stall is right next to him
cerrano has set up an altar in his locker
in front of his bats which are lined up like sentinels is a table covered with pictures of baseball players figurines of saints several lit candles and in the middle
a primitive fetish doll with a cigar in its mouth
cerrano has drawn some magic signs on his bats
he finishes an incantation and then lights the cigar on the fetish doll
what are you doin there pedro
they are sick
so are mine
is somethin goin around
no hit curve ball
straight ball hit it very much
curve ball bats are afraid
i ask jo buu to come
take fear from bats
maybe hes the pagan saint of baseball
i offer him cigars and gin
he will come
cerrano pours some gin in a small cup and puts it next to the fetish doll
harris has been listening to all this
cerrano grabs a towel to head for the showers
i wouldnt leave this gin sittin around out here with this group
with a certain gravity is very bad to steal jo buus gin
is very bad
cerrano closes his locker and goes off to the showers leaving everyone to wonder just how bad
sequence omitted from original script
compressing and detailing the progress of spring training
we see a vaughn on the pitchers mound
a tin replica of a batter has been set up at home plate and rope stretched across the plate to delineate the strike zone
vaughn fires a pitch and hits the tin batter in the hip leaving a dent in him
b cerrano in the batting cage flailing away in futility at several curve balls
doing push ups at night
hes the only one left on the field except temple who supervises
doing the scramble drill blocking down balls purposely thrown in the dirt one after another
when it ends he can hardly get to his feet
waving a ten foot boa constrictor in the sign of the cross in front of his locker before opening it
no red tag greets him
hayes watches from a safe distance
holding a mirror under the vents on his locker door to get a peek inside to see if theres a red tag there
taking a hard ground ball off the chest
dorn is pissed
throwing at the ropes again
the tin batter is dented in every conceivable place now
vaughn whips in another fast ball
this one hits the tin man in the head knocking it completely off
in an exhibition game attempting to throw out a base stealer
jake springs out of his crouch and fires down to second on a bounce
the ball skips into center field
also in an exhibition game swinging at a pitch and popping it up behind the plate
he just drops in his tracks and starts to do push ups as the catcher makes the catch behind him
flailing away again at a curve ball
this and the remaining shots are all in exhibition games
waving a ten inch garter snake in front of his locker
even at this size we can tell it scares the hell out of him but it works its magic
no red tag
with a runner on third winding up and throwing a pitch four feet over taylors head
the run scores
attempting to steal second
he goes into a hell bent for leather head first slide
unfortunately he comes up two feet short of the base
the second baseman whos waiting for him with the ball makes a motion for him to keep coming
hayes flips him the bird
on the bench
he turns to pepper with a look that says can you believe this shit
waiting for a throw at the plate
just as hes about to catch it the runner knocks him flat
his head in his hands
as taylor gets up and goes to the wrong dugout the montage ends
players are filing off the team bus after the game
we pick up taylor hayes and vaughn as they head toward the locker room
this is final cut down day right
yeh better get your snake ready hayes
no im goin cold turkey today
my hands are too screwed up to hold it anyway
hayes reveals a pair of red and cut hands
if youre gonna use that head first slide you better get yourself some gloves or youre not gonna have any skin left on your hands
theyve reached the locker room now
i dont wanna go in there
whatever happens keep it to yourself until youre outta the locker room
dont celebrate in front of guys who just died
what if were one of the deceased
taylor goes into the locker room
hayes and vaughn hang back
cerrano is already at his locker
hes got two snakes this time and some kind of voodoo head dress on
he sprays a patch of white paint on the locker door from a spray can draws a symbol door
he kisses the snake leaving some white paint on his lips like a kid whos just had a glass of milk
taylor exhausted from the game lifts his latch and peers inside
hes made it too
cerrano offers a hand
taylor shakes it and breaks a weary smile
opens locker slumps on stool
hes a goner
the two rookies are still hanging back
cmon vaughn lets show some nuts here
if they cut us well just sign with the yankees
hayes strides manfully to his locker and pulls it open
this doesnt tell him much however because hes got his eyes closed
he stands that way a beat ot two then opens one eye
seeing no tag he turns and walks double time out of the locker room as if he had to get to the john
he comes outside turns a corner and starts leaping around like a wild man
drawing strength from hayes walks resolutely to his locker and whips it open
there hanging from the top hook is the red death
vaughn stares at it expressionless then slowly closes his locker
vaughn goes right in without knocking and leans on browns desk
i got news for you mr
you havent heard the last of me
you think im shit now but someday youll be sorry you cut me
im gonna catch on somewhere else and every time i pitch against you im gonna stick it up your ass
good i like that kinda spirit in a player
the only problem is i didnt cut you
what do you mean
i think somebodys been havin fun with you
we go to vaughn his faced a mask of anger and embarrassment
vaughn charges across the room and jumps dorn
the men grapple and fight all over the room until taylor finally gets them separated
to vaughn whats the matter little lady
cant you take a joke
vaughn gives dorn a look that indicates this isnt over
lou brown enters the room
can i have your attention please
i counted up your ballots for team captain and i think you chose the right guy
if you hadnt i woulda told you he won anyway
c for the year jake taylor
the team breaks into applause and whistles as taylors name is announced
dorn is the only one who seems unhappy about it
as taylor accepts the congratulations of his teammates he turns to vaughn
forget about dorn
you got other things to do
packing for cleveland
taylor gives him a wide smile
vaughn finally allows himself one
such as it is
we move down to the same diner we saw during the opening of the film
the same three guys as before are at the counter
you see the new lineup the indians got
i never heard of most of em
the business executive is talking to the limo driver as he reads the sports section
i dont know the majority of these names
the two longshoremen again looking at a paper
who are these fuckin guys
the two korean groundskeepers again dragging the infield
in subtitles theyre shitty
taylor is alone in the stadium standing near home plate in his street clothes taking in the massive stadium remembering glories past
he steps into the batters box and takes his stance
to himself two down
bottom of the ninth
taylor points to the left field stands
he imagines a pitch coming in takes a mighty swing and admires the flight of the imaginary ball as it arches high in the mid day sky landing deep in
the left field seats
breaking into his home run trot he circles the bases slapping the third base coachs hand and exchanging low fives with his teamates as he reaches the plate
suddenly his reverie is interrupted by the sound of applause
he turns and looks in the dugout where hayes and vaughn are giving him a hand
really got all of that one
what was it
taylor is too embarrassed to reply
one of clevelands finest
taylor hayes and vaughn are seated at a table
what are you gonna have
i dont know
what language is this
they got patty melts over there
lets have a toast
the three raise their wine glasses
heres to baseball heres to the start of two great careers and for me heres to at least one more good year in the sun
the glasses clink
suddenly taylors attention fixes on something across the room a stunning young woman in her late twenties lynn westland
shes having dinner with a date in a three piece suit
hayes and vaughn follow taylors eyes to the woman
what is it
thats my wife
does she know it
i mean she woulda been if i hadnt screwed it up
whos that guy shes with
i dont know
hes not wearing a name tag
you want me to beat the shit out of him
what does she do
shes a librarian
shit i gotta start readin again
a waiter approaches the table where lynn and her date are sharing a dessert
miss wells theres a telephone call for you
lynn is somewhat surprised but gets up to take the call
we follow her to the pay phone in the hall
how did you know i was here
just a hunch
i took you there when you got your masters
i figure youre probably wearing the black velvet dress with the red sash
she is indeed
lynn is a little unsettled by this display of clairvoyance
how did you know that
i didnt have this dress when we were
sensing that somethings askew she turns and looks across the way to see jake talking to her on the pay phone on the other side of the hall maybe ten
he gives her his best grin
you look great
lynn as is often the case with jake is both charmed and put out
she goes with put out
what are you doin here
arent you supposed to be in mexico somewhere
im playin with the indians again
back in the bigs
im happy for you jake
and she is
not so sure about herself though

she looks at him a beat unsure what to say then heads back toward her table
we go to lynns date
none of this has been lost on him
taylor hayes and vaughn are the fares
whats the number again
looking at a piece of paper
what is this place
furnished apartment building owned by the indians
we get special rates
with what were makin well need it
the cabbie pulls to a stop and points to the other side of the street
taylor and the others turn to see a dismal run down building with a neon sign that says the turk
welcome to the big leagues
jake goes to a pay phone in the hall and dials the number lynn gave him
hello cuyahoga sheet metal
taylor doesnt like the sound of this
you got anybody workin there named lynn wells
never heard of her
didnt think so
taylor hangs up staring off into space
various players are dressing out for the game
we pick up cerrano putting on his undergarments
theyre all black including his jock
dorn reads the wall street journal while taylor sits on the trainers table getting his knees taped
hayes checks the fit of his new uniform from every angle in a mirror
he thinks he looks pretty good
vaughn just squeezes a baseball in his left hand obviously a little uptight
taylor gives him a chuck on the shoulder
take it easy
we got of these to go
lou brown enters the locker room
all right lets gather round
the players turn their attention to brown
im not much for inspirational addresses
i just wanta point out that every newspaper in the country has picked us to finish last
the local press thinks wed save everybody a lot of time and trouble if we just went out and shot ourselves
me i like to waste sportswriters time so im for hangin around and seein if we can give all these guys a nice big shitburger to eat
cheers all around
arent we gonna have a prayer
i mean were not all savages like cerrano
you guys go ahead
i belong to the church of three run homers
all right lets bow our heads
many of the players follow suit
suddenly the silence is shattered by a loud explosive sound scaring the hell out of everybody
all eyes turn to cerrano who has just set off a charge of gunpowder on his locker altar
have to wake up bats
disgusted harris and the others turn back to their prayers
dear lord we ask
harris never gets to finish
the smoke rising from cerranos gunpowder explosion sets off the automatic sprinklers in the ceiling
as harris and the faithful look up into the downpour we
the stands are nearly empty
of the fans who have showed up many wear doormats around their necks
bobby vic johnny and thelma our four fans from the diner sit alone in the vast expanse of the centerfield bleachers
all four wear indian head dresses and have war paint on their faces
the three men each have tom toms
thelma works on her needlepoint
you read the plain dealer today
they said this is gonna be the worst indian team weve had in years
everybody laughs at the indians now but there were other times
even won the series in
then willie mays made that catch on vic wertz in the series and clevelands never been the same since
as the indians go so goes cleveland huh
if we ever lost the indians cleveland would die
we get our fist glimpse of harry doyle the indians year old radio announcer
harrys never walked past a bar in anger
hes been with the indians through thin and thinner
on the air hello everybody harry doyle here welcoming all you friends of the feather to another season of indians baseball
pouring some jack daniels in his coke a lotta new faces for the tribe this year as they take on the defending american league champs the new york yankees
and listen to the roar of the crowd as the indians takes the field
doyle leans out the press box window with his mike trying to pick up the sound of a couple guys clapping down below
yes sir they love this club here in cleveland
doyle takes a hit of his spiked coke
flies out to hayes who makes a basket catch a la willie mays
high fly ball centerfield
hayes under it now
oh makes a basket catch willie mays style and the side is retired
the team comes in off the field to much enthusiasm and back slapping
all right way to look way to look
nice catch hayes
dont ever fuckin do it again
okay lets get it goin
bottom of the first willie mays hayes to lead it off for the tribe
going through his warmup routine at the plate
a lotta people say you can tell how a seasons gonna go by the first hitter of the year
in the last fifteen years the indians have never had the season lead off hitter reach base
hayes is in the batters box now
the yankee pitcher winds and fires
hayes swings and hits a little dribbler toward the second baseman who races in and scoops it up bare handed
hot shot toward the hole
rudia knocks it down gets up fires to first
hayes beats it
doyle leans out the window again trying to pick up some cheering
and so the string is broken
maybe things will turn around a little for the indians this year
our four fans from here on known as the bleacher band overjoyed by hayes hit start beating the tom toms and singing a fight song theyve composed called in the
land of burning waters to the tune of the old hamms beer jingle
in the land of burning waters waters lurks the injun nine oh so fine we love those mighty redmen turn their foes to dead men ummmmm
as hayes comes back to the bag where the yankee first baseman is waiting for him
showed some real power on that one slugger
i plan to get at least a double out of it
hayes reaches in his back pocket and pulls out one of the pairs of black leather gloves he bought earlier
and now hayes is putting on a pair of black gloves sending a little message to the yankees
to the first baseman bought a hundred of these one for each base i plan to steal
excuse me here i gotta take my first step toward the hall of fame
hayes takes his lead off and crouches ready to steal
you look real sharp but youll never steal second with your shoe untied
hayes looks down at his shoe
its not untied
he notices too late that the pitcher is throwing over to pick him off
brewster quick move to first
hayes dives back for the bag but never gets there his face smashing up against the first basemans glove which is already holding the ball
he got him
hayes is picked off
nice base running dildo
hard to get your thumb out of your ass with the gloves on
hayes lies in the dust humiliated
well so much for that
doyle takes a long pull on his coke and we go into a montage depicting the indians progressive disintegration in this game
we see a three fielders converging on a short pop fly into left field
they all collide and go down in a heap as the ball drops untouched
b dorn playing a grounder off his hip
he fumbles it picks it up fumbles it again
c taylor crouched behind the plate but up off his haunches ready to throw
we hear the voice of his thoughts
gotta be goin
get the throw up
dont bounce the damn ball
the runner on first takes off as the pitch comes in
taylor catches the ball and fires down to second
the ball sails three feet over the second basemans head and on into center field
taylor stands there disgusted
nice throw dickhead
d cerrano striking out on a curve ball
he bawls his bat out on the way to the dugout
e the three fielders we saw before converging on another pop fly into short left
this time all three dive off at the last instant to avoid a collision
once again the ball drops untouched
it shows yankees indians after five innings
there are two empty coca cola cups near the mike
hes working on a third
top of the sixth
rookie sensation ricky vaughn on to pitch now
you can close the book on winters
vaughn stands on the mound rubbing up the baseball with the same intensity we saw in the locker room
easy does it ricky
were only four down
were still in this thing
dont worry if youre off the plate on a few pitches
doesnt hurt to put the fear of god in a hitter
vaughn nods and continues to grind the ball as pepper and taylor leave
the yankee hitter steps in
vaughn winds and fires a screamer
taylor has to leap high to come down with it
first pitch is a little high
the yankee hitter is slightly unnerved by this pitch
this guy kinda wild
i figure you got a chance to survive this at bat
another pitch to the yankee hitter
another pitch to a second yankee hitter
another pitch to a third yankee hitter
he has to jump over it
low and vaughn has walked the bases loaded on twelve straight pitches
by the laws of probability youd think one of those coulda drifted over the plate
bobby gives the downbeat and in honor of vaughn the three men stand to pound out a version of wild thing on the tom toms
bobby does the vocal
wild thing you make my heart sing you walk everything
pepper has reached the mound
i think we got em scared enough now
time to get a few of em out
hes plenty upset with himself
just relax and keep the arm up on top
gotta throw strikes
no place at the inn for this guy
he gives vaughn a pat on the butt and goes back to the dugout
the yankee hitter haywood stands in
hes the first baseman who tagged hayes out
hey taylor what you doin back up here
couldnt cut it in the mexican league
vaughn determined to throw a strike winds and delivers
the ball is a perfect strike right down the middle
haywood crushes it to deep left field
vaughn drops his head not even bothering to look
the ball lands in the second deck a grand slam home run
to brown looked like a strike anyway
you want me to go get him
no lets see how he reacts
vaughn paces around on the mound rubbing up the ball
the next hitter coleman steps in
vaughn gets up on the rubber his face set
he winds up and fires one right into colemans back
coleman goes down in a hurry
at least he hit what he was aimin at
i think you can go get him now
both benches are up on the dugout steps ready to come out
the only thing holding them back is that coleman is being tended to by the trainer
the home plate umpire thumbs vaughn out of the game
vaughn comes down to protest but pepper quickly grabs him and hurries him off the field
as soon as coleman gets up hes gonna be lookin for you
coleman finally gets to his feet still a little shaken
he looks around for vaughn but hes already disappeared into the dugout
coleman walks down to first under his own power
brown signals for a new pitcher and the players on both sides begin to return to the benches
walking alone down the tunnel to the locker room
he angrily knocks one of the overhead light bulbs out with his glove
he now has five empty cups next to the mike plus a near empty bottle of jack daniels
so a tough start for the erie warriors as they drop a heartbreaker to the yankees nine to nothing
the post game show was brought to you by
searching for the paper christ
i cant find it
the hell with it
this is harry doyle saying good night everybody and happy hunting
with that doyle passes out on his face
in her private box at the stadium
with her are donovan and butler
getting up to leave were off to a good start gentlemen
lets keep it up
we go to donovan
he watches rachel go in disgust
taylor hayes and vaughn are in a booth having a beer
vaughn is still in a funk
god i was horse shit tonight
only thing you got to be sorry about was hittin coleman
if you wanted to send a message it shoulda been to haywood
he hit the damn homer
coleman was just picking his nose in the on deck circle
vaughn nods slowly
forget the other stuff
it coulda happened to anybody
besides haywood didnt hit it that good
that ball wouldnt have been out of a lotta parks
oh yeh name one
after a pause yellowstone
vaughn just looks at taylor a second and then smiles in spite of himself
we see taylor walking up the steps and through the massive front door
we pick up taylor making his way past the circulation desk
he glances around and finds what hes looking for lynn talking to one of the reference librarians
she finishes her conversation and turns to find herself face to face with taylor
shes wearing her tortoise shell glasses
hushed jake you shouldnt have come here
i was wonderin why youd give an old friend a bum phone number
lets talk in my office okay
i dont wanna talk in your office
lynn starts to walk
well follow them as they make their way through the library
lynn tries to keep the conversation hushed
taylor could give a shit
i told you i dont think its a good idea for us to see each other
we dont have anything in common
sometimes i wonder if we ever did
what are you talkin about
we were both athletes world class hot for each other
what more can you have in common
i stopped bein an athlete three years ago
books are my life now
jake suppresses a smile
dont you dare laugh jake
in two years ive put together one of the best special collections departments in the country
so what is it
youre still sore i never read moby dick
you never read anything i asked you to
not like whats his name at the restaurant
his name is tom and keep your voice down
what do ya see in this guy
and ive never found him in bed with a stewardess
thats cause no stewardess would have him
wouldnt you rather be with somebody whos in demand
just like always you dont take anything seriously
everythings a joke to you
cmon lynn for christ sake im just tryin to loosen things up a little
im gettin frostbite here
lynn stops and turns to face him
tom and i are getting married in the fall
taylor is momentarily floored by the revelation
thats crazy lynn
i got plans for us
walking again what plans
i was gonna play another a year or two then we go to hawaii and have a couple kids who grow up to be olympic champions
stopping again how can you think stuff like that
i havent seen you in two years
you never even wrote me a letter
im sorry lynn but i wasnt exactly proud of my situation
cmon you didnt think about me at all since i been gone
walking again not so loud jake
remember the three nights we spent on the beach in vera cruz
you have nights like that with mr
stopping again what about the night you had in detroit with miss dairy queen
theyre in the large reading room now
what was i supposed to do
she bet me fifty bucks she had a better body than you
i had to defend your honor
whirling on him and exploding what a bunch of bullshit
exasperated i have a much better body than she does
with this the whole reading room turns around and stares at her
lynn is mortified by her outburst
taylor tries to smooth it over
addressing the library patrons shes right
take it from me she really does
i mean miss dairy queen has quantity i give her that but the ah quality just isnt there
nice job jake
lynn is still mortified
how many think lynn oughta give me another shot
most of the hands in the room shoot up
the ayes have it
walking off again you havent changed at all have you
im afraid i have or i wouldnt be here
cmon lynn i dont wanna do time for things that happened years ago
turning back to him im sorry jake
youll always be the little boy who wouldnt grow up
lynn starts off for her office door
lynn continues on into her office
as the door closes we go to taylors forlorn face
rachel is in closed door session with donovan
a quarter of the seasons gone were and seven games out of first
our attendance is just below
thats bad but not bad enough
projected over the whole season we stand to wind up games under
and out of first
that should be bad enough for anybody
we finished out last year and still drew
when schools out for the summer attendance is liable to rise
plus this team is showing signs of improvement
i didnt think wed win games all year
on how we can get worse
sarcastic how about a series of fines for good play
maybe a bonus to the guy chosen least valuable player
this is no laughing matter donovan
pause i think maybe the problem is were coddling these guys too much
as donovan wonders what she means by that we
we pick up taylor hayes vaughn and the other indians coming down a corridor to their plane
whats with this
we never leave from this terminal
maybe the other ones jammed up
they come through the gate where they see two american airlines jets on the tarmac
pointing to the jets which one is ours
the gateman points off screen
suddenly an old dc with the indian logo on it pulls into frame
this one was obviously bought from the military
the seats are s army issue and the ribs of the fuselage are exposed
the plane is bobbing and lurching through a ferocious storm
what is this lou
front office says its an economy measure cause were not drawin good
well they certainly have spared every expense
we pick up cerrano crossing himself
harris sees it
oh so now you come around
pointing up hes not fooled
hayes sits petrified in his chair his knuckles whitening on the arm rest
call the stewardess vaughn
i need one of those bags
there arent any stewardesses
i wonder if theres any pilots
we pick up doyle doing the play by play of the indians next game
he can barely keep his eyes open
two down top of the ninth
last chance for the red and blue
the brewer pitcher delivers and a cleveland player hits a ground ball to the brewer second baseman who throws him out
bouncing ball to second
this should be it
collins up with it on to first and the game is over
in the press box again
so the sons of geronimo still suffering a bit from propeller lag are nipped by the tigers tonight to
the only excitement for the tribe provided by rick vaughn who set an american league record by throwing four wild pitches in one inning
for the tigers runs hits and no errors
for the indians one run and lets see one hit
to his stat man is that all we got one fucking hit
whispering you cant say fuckin on the air
dont worry about it
nobodys listening anyway
dorn and harris are at one table taylor and vaughn at one across the way
who you got lined up tonight
where are we
kansas city right
gotta be arlene you call her
dont have to
she knows when im in town
im about ready to turn in
ive anesthetized my knees enough
a guy from the bar approaches the table
excuse me mr
vaughn can i have your autograph
signing my first autograph
i couldnt give these away a couple weeks ago
i saw your record on the news
you made their hall of shame
youre a celebrity now vaughn
i thought you had to do somethin good to be a celebrity
not if you do it colorfully
pointing to the door whatd i tell ya
we go to the door to find arlene standing with two friends rene and vicki
arlene is a looker alright and seriously built
she cases the room spies dorn and comes over to his table
this is vicki and rene
this is steve harris
wheres your buddy gant
indicating vaughn they cut him to make room for bristle boy over there
looking over at vaughn is that vaughn the guy they call wild thing
in disgust yeh
hes kinda cute
they say he could be a big star
what are you talkin about
he couldnt find the plate if it was magnetized
he wont last the year
he struck out five in a row before the wild pitches
taking her leave maybe ill check him out
grabbing her wait a minute youre with me
taylor watches this exchange from across the room
i dont remember you makin any date
since when do i have to make a date
whos been showin you this town the last three years
ancient history rodger
i gotta look out for myself now
i dont have to be a slave to no
arlene pulls away and heads for the jukebox as dorn seethes
she punches a button and we hear xs version of wild thing
arlene sashays right up to vaughn in time with the music
wild thing you make my heart sing
arlene knows how to make the big entrance
vaughns slightly overwhelmed
taking this all in from across the room
taylor comes up next to him
guess were over with eh dorn
speak for yourself taylor
i got a couple good years left
we pick up taylor in his seat glasses on reading something by the light of a flashlight rigged up to the back of his seat
we move to reveal it the classics illustrated comic book of moby dick
hayes wanders by an air sick bag hanging around his neck
what is that
its one of the masterpieces of american literature thats all
lynn put you on to this
long time ago
well were goin to a club tonight
you wanna come along
no i got some more reading to do
taylor indicates a stack of classic comics next to him
what you got a test or somethin
why dont you just go over and see her
maybe shell let you slide on a couple of these
i might if i knew where she lives
tail her home from the library
you mean sit in a car and wait for her to come out
thats kinda juvenile dont you think
as if that had anything to do with it yeh
taylor sits in his car across the street from the employee entrance of the library
he scrunches down a bit as lynn comes out of the building and heads for her car
she gets in and we
driving through the city with taylor following at a discrete distance
finally lynn pulls up outside an expensive looking townhouse
taylor pulls up further down the street and watches her go inside debating whether to go in after her
taylors having a beer still trying to decide whether to go see her or not
pulling up outside the townhouse he saw lynn go into
he goes up the stairs and knocks on the door
lynn answers looking more dressed up than when she left the library
shes surprised to see taylor
look lynn im sorry i followed you home but i wanna
hurried this isnt my place
whose place is it
before lynn can answer tom appears at the door
whos there love
spying taylor oh mr
pointedly i remember you from the restaurant
lynns told me a lot about you
why dont you come in for a while
nah thats o
i got some things to do
yeh hes gotta be goin
no really come on in for a drink
before taylor can beg off further tom ushers him inside and closes the door
in the room are two other couples arthur holloway a senior partner in toms firm and his wife claire and brent bowden another lawyer in the firm and a contemporary
his wife is janice
this is a very upscale group
excuse me everybody this is jake taylor
making the intros jake arthur and claire holloway brent and janice bowden
jake is a professional baseball player
polite nods from the group except for janice who seems somewhat intrigued
so jake what brings you here this evening
i ah just had a couple books i wanted to discuss with lynn
i thought this was her place
well it soon will be
yeh i heard you guys were engaged
taylor sticks out his hand
toms not sure whether taylors putting him on or not
he shakes anyway
what can i get you to drink
beerll be fine
tom goes off to get the beer
what team do you play for jake
here in cleveland
i didnt know they still had a team
yeh we have uniforms and everything
its really great
handing jake his beer theyre last right now but hopefully moving up eh jake
tom clinks his glass with jakes beer the slight condescension in his manner not lost on taylor
lynn is uncomfortable with this whole situation
janice moves a bit closer to taylor
its obvious she finds him attractive
im told that baseball players make very good salaries these days
that depends on how good they are i guess
how good are you
lynn is irritated by janices directness
i make the league minimum
tom and the others react as if taylors just announced a death in the family
he was one of the best in baseball until he had problems with his knees
everyone is somewhat surprised by lynns quick defense of taylor including lynn herself
what are you going to do when your career ends
i mean you cant play baseball forever can you
somethinll come up
i dont know i was thinkin of goin to hawaii and having a couple of kids who grow up to be olympic champions
in what event
maybe the two hundred meter individual medley
i figure it oughta be big by then
jack just nods
he never heard of it
you got the girl picked out
i did but i wasnt smart enough to hold on to her
lynns eyes drop to the floor
you used to be an athlete didnt you lynn
not wanting to pursue it yes
what did you do
reluctant two hundred individual medley
alternate on the olympic team
a tense silence settles on the group
well i gotta be goin
nice to have met you all
taylor exchanges a quick glance with lynn and heads for the door
let me walk you out
tom accompanies taylor to the door out of earshot of the others
thanks for the beer
dont mention it
ill let you know if i land a good job
i know youre concerned about it
yeh well i just wanted lynn to know what she wouldve had ahead of her
tom sticks out his hand
the two men shake to keep up appearances for their onlookers across the room
stay away from her
smiling suck my dick
vaughn and hayes are watching a soap opera on an old black and white tv
pepper pops his head in
lou wants to see you down at the office rick
vaughn looks somewhat apprehensively at hayes
brown is lost in thought at his desk
vaughn appears at the door like a boy expecting a spanking
cmon in rick
vaughn comes in and takes a seat
rick im not gonna beat around the bush here
you got a great arm one of the best ive ever seen but your control hasnt come around like we hoped it would
vaughn nods contritely
now there are a lotta pitchers that started out wild and after workin it out in the minors for a while went on to great careers
pointing to a picture on the wall take sandy koufax there
vaughn looks at the picture on the wall
he squints slightly
brown notices it
what about koufax
never mind koufax
brown quickly prints some big letters on a legal pad and goes to stand about fifteen feet from vaughn
read these letters starting at the top
vaughn balks a second and then concentrates on the pad squinting
unsettled he squints harder
he even tries closing one eye
cant read it can you
vaughn shakes his head no
you gonna send me to the minors
sequence omitted from original script
taylor hayes vaughn and the others are dressing out for the game
vaughn is wearing his glasses
these things make me look ridiculous
drop in the bucket vaughn
meanwhile cerrano is sharpening a long knife at his locker
whats that for
gin and cigarettes not enough for jo buu
i still can no hit curva ball for sheet
i hafta make a sacrifice to him
you mean like something living
i kill unborn children
not while im here youre not
cerrano pulls the unborn chicken out of his pocket a common store bought egg
harris is a little embarrassed at his outburst
cerrano touches the egg to his forehead then places it on his altar
in one swift motion he slams the knife down on it cutting it into two perfect halves
taylor and the others are agape at a knife sharp enough to do this
as the yolk spreads out on the altar brown emerges from his office
all right lets hit the field
the locker room quickly empties leaving one man behind harris
he looks around to make sure everyone is gone then tiptoes over to cerranos locker
screwing up his courage he picks up jo buus cup of gin
heres looking at ya jo buu
he bolts it down then backs into the middle of the room waiting at the ready as if half expecting a bolt of lightning
when nothing happens he gloats at the fetish doll in triumph
strutting out of the dugout feeling like a million bucks
as he emerges onto the field a hitter in the batting cage swings and misses the bat slipping out of his hands
away it flies whirling off down the third base line in a wide arc
it hits harris in the back of the head and knocks him cold
watching the game from the dugout a zip lock baggie full of ice cubes strapped to his head
were in the ninth two down man on first and the indians clinging to a one run lead
vaughan one out away from his first major league victory
sequence omitted from original script
vaughn wearing his new glasses paces the mound nervously
he goes to the rosin bag wipes his brow shakes out his arm
finally up on the rubber he gets the sign from taylor goes to his stretch checks the runner and fires to the plate
swings and hits a grounder between third and short
dorn moves to his left but the ball goes past his glove and into left field
there is some question as to whether dorn really gave it a full effort
bouncing ball dorn cant get to it into left field base hit
clarke digging around second hell make it to third and the as have runners at the corners
vaughn stomps around on the mound obviously upset
he glares at dorn a beat before getting back on the mound
dorns face is non commital
brown paces in the dugout
you want me to go get him
no hes come this far
lets see if he can finish it
doyle downs a little more rum and coke in the press box
vaughn in a little trouble here but ill tell ya these cleveland fans are great
listen to them get behind vaughn
doyle imitates the sound of a crowd cheering with his own voice punctuated by whistles and clapping
thelma calmly knits her blanket with the scores of all the indians games stitched into it the madame la farge of cleveland
the boys however are a little restless
we need some defense here
maybe we oughta do a wave
cmon indians dont do waves
lets keep this thing pure
what harm could it do
the next oakland hitter steps in
taylor flashes a sign
vaughn comes to the stretch and delivers
high ball one
the runner on first goes down to second without a throw the pitch being too tough to handle
runner goes high taylor has no play
the go ahead and potential winning run is in scoring position
taylor walks out in front of the plate to throw the ball back to vaughn
forget the runners ricky get this guy at the plate
taylor goes back behind the dish
vaughn gets up on the rubber
he winds and comes to the plate
way high this time
high ball two and the crowd doesnt like that call one bit
doyle imitates the sound of a crowd booing
taylor meanwhile has gone out to the mound
okay lets get nasty here rick
you know hes lookin for this pitch
gotta come up with somethin studly
game shoulda been over by now
dorn coulda had that ball
he tanked it on purpose
this isnt the california penal league vaughn
were professionals here
we dont tank a play for personal reasons so cut the crybaby shit
youve pitched a helluva game
you wanna finish it dont ya
can you give me a strike on this pitch
yeh but i dont know if therell be much on it
my arm feels like jello
just make sure its over the plate
i want him to swing
the last time i did that the guy hit one that hasnt landed yet
dont worry ill take care of it
taylor starts back toward the plate and then stops
by the way i been meaning to ask you
whyd you steal that car
i was bored
next time you might think about takin in a movie or somethin
vaughn permits himself a little smile and release from the tension
taylor smiles back and trots off toward the plate
bobby and vic are doing a two man wave
when one sits down the other stands up
has settled in behind the plate now
he starts talking to the batter rexman
helluva situation we got goin here huh rexman
two on two out youre down by a run in the ninth
you got a chance to be a hero on national television so whatever you do dont blow it
theyll be callin you a gutless choke artist all over america
rexman shoots taylor a wicked glance
youre a free agent at the end of the year
not much demand for gutless choke artists
what are you hittin now
hey nice average
uh oh on second thought that still means you got a seven outta ten chance of goin in the dumper
rexman slightly irritated backs out of the box
shut up will ya taylor
hey i can understand not wantin to talk about baseball when your nuts are in a vice like this
rexman gets back in the box
by the way i saw your wife at the capri lounge last night
hell of a dancer
you must be very proud
rexman is trying to ignore taylor but failing badly
taylor flashes a sign to vaughn
vaughn goes into his windup
but that guy she was with
i mean im sure hes a close personal friend of yours and all but tell me
vaughn releases his pitch
why was he wearing her panties on his head
rexman completely unnerved takes a feeble swing and hits a high pop up out in front of the plate
uh oh rexie i dont think that ones got the distance
maybe if the wind comes up
taylor moves out two steps and makes the catch easily ending the game
taylor rushes out to congratulate vaughn
the players exchange handshakes and high fives as brown watches from the dugout
its startin to come together pepper
its startin to come together
taylor pulls up outside and walks up to the door
suzanne dorns wife answers
oh hi jake how are you
fine suzanne can i have a quick word with rodger
sure cmon in hes in the den
ill get some coffee
we follow taylor into the luxurious den where we find dorn watching his wide screen tv in a smoking jacket
hey jake old boy what brings you out here
i just wanta tell ya somethin but i didnt want to do it in front of the whole team
sure go ahead
like nails i dont know what your problem is but
bending close to dorn if i ever see you tank another play like you did tonight ill cut off your nuts and stuff em down your fuckin throat
dorn looks at taylor for some sign that hes kidding
he doesnt get one
taylor turns and walks on out as we go to dorns stunned face
suzanne walks in with a tray
the indians are undressing after practice
why the hell are we havin practice during the all star break
i heard the big lady upstairs ordered it
its hotter than shit in here
what happened to the air conditioning
we go to brown naked and dragging from the heat
he approaches the whirlpool and turns on the water
to dorn oh man this old body can use a soak
its not workin again
brown flips on a switch
the whirlpool makes some grinding noises and then quits altogether
damn it i thought they were gonna replace this thing
harris shouts over from the showers where hes just turned on the water
hey theres no hot water in here
shes at it again
ive had it with this nickel and dime stuff
storming out of the training room im gonna get the bitch on the phone
brown is stopped short by the sight of rachel phelps standing in the middle of the locker room as various unclad players dive for cover
you wanted to see the bitch
dont you think you oughta cover yourself with a towel first mr
there arent any towels and im too old to be diving under benches
well i can take it if you can
what happened to the new whirlpool we were supposed to get
revenue problems have forced us to cut back on equipment
well simply have to fix the old one
you fixed it six times already
and now theres no hot water in the showers
the pipes in this building are old and rusted
were replacing them but its a long expensive process
how am i supposed to keep my players healthy with cold water and no therapy equipment
your players will just have to get a little tougher
what are they a bunch of pansies
immediately arms shoot up behind her in the italian up yours gesture
she turns around but by then the players have quickly returned to normal positions
over games even tough guys get sprains sore arms muscle pulls
its only temporary
besides these guys werent playing that good when the equipment was workin
if i could get anybody to come and watch this team none of this would be necessary
you oughta be grateful i can still pay your salaries
with that rachel turns and walks out
brown and the others can only watch her go
sequence omitted from original script
sequence omitted from original script
on the air
in case you havent noticed and judging by attendance you havent the indians that thought to be hopeless collection of has beens and never will bes is actually approaching the
mark and with it semi respectability
nothing to write home about to be sure but at least we dont have to cover our eyes
bobby vic and johnny are at the counter
ya know they could be a lot worse
the business executive is talking with a friend while working out on the nautilus machines
ya know i may have underestimated this team a bit
the two longshoremen again
ya know these guys arent so fuckin bad
the two groundskeepers are repairing the pitchers mound
in subtitles theyre still shitty
sequence omitted from original script
sequence omitted from original script
brown storms out of the dugout doing his best to look incensed
ah shit here comes lou
gimme a break mel
i gotta get outta here
all right kick some dirt on me
the commissionerll buy that
taylor begins kicking dirt on wingos shoes ala billy martin
wingo takes a dramatic hop skip and jump and gives taylor the heave ho thumb just as brown arrives
wingo turns away
to wingo hey dont you go anywhere
i wanna have a few words with you
brown grabs taylor and pulls him aside
under his breath what are we arguin about here
struggling as if he wanted to get at wingo fucker called that a ball
you mean the one that was a foot outside
taylor breaks away and starts back to the dugout
playing it to the hilt he throws his glove and mask to the ground on the way
meanwhile brown is going jaw to jaw with wingo outraged at the call
brown pulls a carrot out of his back pocket and offers it to wingo who immediately thumbs him out
leaving her seat and starting up the aisle
taylor comes up the stairs from the locker room still in full uniform
he emerges onto the box level to see lynn disappearing down the ramp toward the parking lot
in the parking lot
as she goes to unlock her car taylor looks around hurriedly for some kind of vehicle to follow her in
he bangs on the bullpen gates and is admitted by the guard
inside is the bullpen car a souped up golf cart with a body shaped like a batting helmet
taylor hops in and roars out after lynn
lynn comes out of the dressing room into the pool area deserted this time of night
she wears a racing suit but lets her hair hang free
the pool glows like a sheet of emerald glass
she shakes down a beat curls her toes around the coping slowly bends at the waist and then launches into a full out racing dive
we watch as she swims a yard individual medley first the butterfly then the backstroke breaststroke and finally freestyle
we condense the time of course shooting some underwater some slo mo as she knives through the water her hair flowing behind her an athlete alone with her medium
the sequence should convey not only the grace of her strokes and her athletic ability but the fluid beauty of swimming its synthesis of power and form
as she begins the freestyle leg another body appears in the pool next to her
its jake and hes racing her the final lap
she immediately responds to the challenge digging harder picking up her kick
they go neck and neck for yards but lynn has one more gear and touches him by half a body length at the wall
both are winded
you still got that great kick
just like the first time i ever saw you
you follow me here too
yeh what did you want to see me about
what do you mean
you wouldnt have been at the game if you didnt want to see me about something
getting out of the pool i just wanted to see you play
how was i
you looked good but you oughta open your stance a little
theyre pitching you inside
ill try that
you wanna have some dinner
sorry i already ate
i forgot your life is different now
getting out of the pool thanks for the race
watching her go anytime
driving through the city on her way home
lynn glances in the rear view mirror and spots taylor following her
she smiles to herself
taylor of course thinks hes gone undetected
we begin a short sequence during which lynn tries to lose taylor in a chase through cleveland car vs
the logistics will have to be worked out in cleveland but suffice it to say by the end of the chase she appears to have ditched him
lynn comes up the stairs unlocks the apartment door and steps inside
theres no particular urgency
she feels sure shes shaken taylor
the apartment is full of packing boxes
tired from the chase lynn drops her bag on a box and slumps down on the couch
its obvious shes not all that happy to have lost taylor
she goes to the window and looks down to the street for some sign of him
seeing nothing she turns away from the window disappointed and starts back to the couch when something stops her
its taylor standing in the doorway
whose place are we at this time
you follow me again
when i saw you at the game i figured you wanted to see me about something
i just wanted to see you play
how was i
you looked good but you oughta open your stance a little
theyre pitchin you inside
ill try that
taylor gives a perfunctory nod
they look at each other a second
theres still plenty there
taylor begins to come toward her
we hear his cleats on the floor
she backs off but not with real conviction
i think i oughta tell you that im moving in with tom
goin uptown huh
im not goin uptown i just want to lead a regular life
you know like an adult maybe
with a house and a garden and normal hours
you think i cant lead a regular life
you like the life youve had jake
you like hangin out with the boys livin in hotels eatin dinner at midnight having girls send you their underwear in the mail
remember the surprise party i threw for you when you made the all star team
you never showed up but the doorbell rang once and we all got quiet and hid behind the furniture
it was a guy to serve you with a paternity suit
that was a hoax
the girl was just trying to get some publicity
yes but you had obviously been with her
and it happened in front of all our friends
i was drownin lynn
the endorsements were dryin up my knees were goin they were talkin about sendin me down
i was just trying to hold on to somethin prove to myself i was still an all star
i dont care about that anymore
i know i dont have much time left in baseball
im just a guy trying to put his life back together
thinkin about you was the only thing that kept me goin in mexico
lynn looks at him a long beat
ive come back to you too many times jake
i cant afford to believe you anymore
lynn is backed up against a desk now
she could move out but doesnt
i guess this is our last hurrah then
i guess so
did you really read moby dick
cover to cover
taylor comes forward to kiss her tentatively at first
their conversation is interwoven with the slowly deepening intensity of their kissing
whens the wedding
your mom and dad like this guy
youre still their favorite
theyre unbuttoning each others shirts now
gonna be a big wedding
tom doesnt like big weddings
you coulda read plot outlines of great novels
at any library
i mean the wedding
all saints on euclid
who saved ishmael at the end
it was queequegs coffin
am i invited
to the wedding
if you want
maybe you really did read it
their shirts are off now
this doesnt change anything you know
we were always good at this
the zipper on your skirt is stuck
use your imagination
taylors spikes come down across her skirt catching in the material ripping it from her body and pinning it to the wood floor
taylor steps out of the shoe and whisks lynn out of frame
we hold on the skirt nailed to the floor by the cleats
taylor wakens and turns over to find lynn gone
he looks around but theres no sign of her
taylor comes down the steps gets in his car and drives out of frame
we hold on the shot and
taylors car pulls into frame
he gets out and goes up the steps
theres one light on in the apartment window
taylor comes up to the door and knocks
getting no answer he pushes it open to find that the apartment is completely empty
just bare hardwood floor
taylor stands forlorn in the center of the room a beat then walks on out switching off the overhead light as he goes
donovan is present once again
rachel does not look pleased
well my worst fears have been confirmed
were and nine games out of first and only two out of the first division
who do those guys think they are
maybe you just have to accept the fact that theyre not as bad as youd hoped
i dont have to accept anything
our attendance is only beginning to rise
if we can force a losing streak for a week or two we can still turn this thing around
the fans are used to losers here
at the first sign of a slump theyll give up on this team
whats left to do
youve taken away everything you can
we pick up a decrepit old greyhound bus coming down the highway belching smoke like a diesel semi
on the side we see the visage of chief wahoo and the words indian express
complete with all the luxuries of the average school bus
temple is looking at a memo from rachel phelps
memo says well only be usin this for short trips
good thing we dont play anybody in europe
taylor is staring out the window still morose about lynns leaving
a stack of classics illustrated comics sits next to him
can i borrow one of those man
they dont have any magazines on this bus
sure go ahead
i think my reading days are over
this a good one
pointing to his stack of classics these are all hall of famers
hayes is impressed
the indian express makes its way through the streets of new york enroute to the indians hotel
we see that now most of the team is reading classic comics
to dorn ill trade you song of hiawatha for the deerslayer
naw im not into song of hiawatha
all right then how about crime and punishment
yeh that sounds pretty good
thats a detective story right
the bus slows down and pulls over to the curb
this is it
the sheffield arms
the players all crowd to the window to get a glimpse of their hotel
hotel is actually overstating it
this place is one cut below the ymca
i dont know if we can survive any more of these economy measures
we pick up taylor hayes and vaughn coming into their dilapidated hotel room
peeling walls and ceilings rickety furniture rusted bathroom fixtures
taylor sprawls down on one of the cots
it collapses on the floor in a cloud of dust
vaughn is on the mound warming up
so ricky vaughn roughed up in his only other appearance against the yankees will see what he can do with the bronx bombers this time
vaughn after a slow start has come on lately and now leads the american league in strikeouts with
vaughn finishes his warmups
as taylor pumps the ball down to second vaughn hears a voice from the yankee dug out
vaughn glances over and sees that one of the yankees is dressed in a striped prison uniform
he also wears long earrings high heels and of course glasses
vaughn tries to ignore the guy but his concentration is broken
vaughn steps up on the rubber for his first pitch
he winds and fires
the yankee leadoff hitter rips a one hopper to the wall in right center
hayes runs it down and guns it back to the infield to hold the guy to a double
the convict whoops it up
vaughn gets back up on the rubber
as he comes to the stretch he catches sight of the convict again
the guy is doing a pantomime sneaking up to a car and picking the lock much to the delight of his teammates
vaughn throws his pitch in the dirt and all the way to the backstop
the runner on second goes to third
throwing the ball back cmon rick baby settle down
vaughn gets ready again
the convict finishes picking the lock and then is suddenly arrested
he puts his hands against the wall and spreads his legs for a weapons check cracking up the whole bench
vaughn is getting a little steamed
his next pitch is hammered into left for a single scoring a run
throwing pitches followed by of the third hitter lining a double down the right field line the fourth hitter a triple off the center field wall and the fifth hitter
a single to right
the scoreboard now reads to yankees
taylor comes out to talk to vaughn
whats the problem rick
youre throwin basketballs up there
that guy in the dugout botherin you
naw im all right
worry about the guys carryin bats
cmon ricky lets get nasty
vaughn nods as taylor trots back behind the plate
vaughn gets set again as his old nemesis haywood steps into the batters box
haywood has a sly smile on his face
as vaughn comes to his stretch the convict goes back into his act
hes in jail now struggling against the bars
finally he bends over and grabs his ankles while one of his teammates humps up against him pretending to bugger him
this sends the yankee bench into hysterics
vaughn has lost it now
he fires to the plate and haywood creams another tape measure job into the upper deck
hayes doesnt even bother to run back to the wall
he just watches it go
i thought now that vaughn had some control he was ready for the yankees
not quite yet
brown makes his way to the mound to take vaughn out
so vaughn pitches in some tough luck here as the yankees put together as few squib hits and take a lead
in the press box
the stadium below is empty the grounds crew covering the infield
well the indians made a gallant comeback today but fell one run short as the yankees held on for a victory although they didnt do squat after the first inning
anyway if the bus makes it here from the hotel well be on at tomorrow night
till then this is harry doyle saying so long everybody and happy hunting
brown is alone in the bar having a drink
a figure sits down on the stool next to him
mind if i join you
surprised to see him donovan
what are you doin here
just wanted to get out on the road
you damn near pulled one out today
someday well figure out how to beat those guys
ya know youve done a helluva job this year
sixty and sixty one is hardly a helluva job
with this club it is
ya know when i first got to camp i figured this team had no chance
i was just hopin wed win enough that i could stay on and really start to build something here
but theres a lotta talent on this club charlie
the veterans are starting to play back to form and the rookies are developing faster than i thought
theres two or three potential all stars in there
i think were a first division team right now
you really believe that dont you
i know it
all we need is something to bring it all together
rachel phelps would never allow that
what do you mean
she doesnt want you in the first division
she doesnt even want you in cleveland
on browns incredulous face we
the players are all gathered around obviously having been called together by brown
addressing the group i got somethin i think you oughta know about
i wouldnt have known about it myself if charlie donovan hadnt told me although i shoulda guessed it from everything thats happened
it seems that mrs
phelps doesnt think too highly of our worth
we take several cuts of faces around the room
she put this team together because she thought wed be bad enough to finish dead last knockin attendance down to the point where she could move the team to miami
pause and get rid of all of us for better personnel
taylor vaughn hayes dorn and the others can hardly believe what theyre hearing
even you dorn
silence descends on the room
in other words phelps thinks were all dinks
that we dont belong in the big leagues
thats about it
what if we dont finish last
shell replace you with somebody who will
after this season youll all be sent back to the minors or given your outright release
pause so all were gonna get is this one year
taylor surveys the bowed heads around the room
he stands to address the group
i dont know about the rest of you but ive been playin baseball since i was five years old
ive had some good years and some years to forget
ive burned out my knees
i dont think i have three fingers that work right
ive lost most of the money i made and baseball has messed up my personal life from time to time
but i know one thing
i can still play this game a little
and id like to know who in this room thinks theyre the kinda bum mrs
phelps is lookin for
eyes dart around the room then come back to taylor
no hands are raised
well then i guess theres only one thing to do
win the whole fuckin thing
we take cuts of the startled faces of the players
as the idea sinks in they begin to come to life
music begins and were into a
detailing the newly motivated indians drive for the pennant and the pennant fever it creates in cleveland
we begin with
hanging a full size blowup of rachel phelps on the locker room wall
in the picture shes pointing as if out at the players and a bubble above her head says you guys stink
a set of designer clothes of the type rachel wears have been superimposed on the picture
the clothes are divided into pull off squares
i figure its gonna take more victories to win this thing
every time we win we peel a square
coming out of an elevator in the turk with a wheelbarrow full of dirt
we pan him down the hall where we see a dirt sliding area hes been building up
leading off a makeshift base in the hall of the turk
as vaughn tosses a ball up in the air hayes takes off down the hall toward another base on the dirt sliding area
vaughn catches the ball and rifles a throw down to taylor who puts the tag on the sliding hayes
cerrano whos umping calls hayes out
hayes jumps up and argues vociferously hopping around in frustration
sequence omitted from original script
hitting one rocket shot ground ball after another at dorn
some bounce off his chest and arms but dorn stays in front of every one
taking off his shirt in the locker room
his chest is a mass of welts and bruises
polishing his bats with black shoe polish and a brush
taking batting practice late at night
he attacks the ball swing after swing
sequence omitted from original script
taking his stretch with a man on first and firing to the plate
the batter swings and misses for strike three while the runner on first breaks for second
taylor rifles a throw down to second nailing the runner for a double play
taking a hot smash off his chest
he picks it up and guns the runner down
sequence omitted from original script
stealing home as the opposing pitcher tries frantically to hurry his windup
hayes slides across safely hooking to the infield side
he jumps up and punches the air with his fist
nailing up the pair of black gloves he used to steal home above his bed
ross farmer microphone in hand stands in front of a blazing bonfire
a large crowd cheers as various people throw doormats on the blaze
to tv camera you remember bra burning in the s well the newest thing in cleveland is doormat burning as indian fans are standing up and saying we wont be
stepped on anymore
blowing fast balls by hitter
with donovan next to her watching all this good play in disgust
lining a single to center
cerrano charges it and fires to the plate as a runner tries to score from second
just as taylor catches the ball hes once again knocked flat by the runner
this time he lies still a beat and then an arm comes up holding the ball
the umpire thumbs the runner out
late at night sitting head down in the outboard motor whirlpool
we pick up three teenage girls walking down the street wearing t shirts that say wild thing i think i love you
a black kid comes by wearing black gloves on each hand
as he passes he holds up one finger signifying number one
the girls return the signal
the business executive passes his secretarys desk gives her some instructions and goes into his office
as soon as hes out of sight she opens her drawer and slips the earplug from a portable radio into her ear
over we hear the indians inside his office
he opens his desk drawer and pulls out an earplug
hes also listening to the game
sequence omitted from original script
sequence omitted from original script
the stripper is wearing a squaw costume with black glove and a wild thing t shirt
several members of the audience have radio earplugs on
of squares of leopard skin fabric being peeled away
under one is revealed a section of bare hip and thigh
under another a navel
under still another the edge of a bare breast and arm
all dressed in tuxedos posed team picture style on the infield of municipal stadium
in unison hello do you know us
were a major league baseball team but since we havent won a pennant in thirty years nobody recognizes us not even in our own hometown
thats why we carry the american express card
no matter how far out of first we are it keeps us from getting shut out at our favorite hotels and restaurants
so if youre looking for some big league clout apply for the little green home run hitter
look what its done for us
people still dont recognize us but
whispering were in the first division now
sliding across home plate in his tuxedo and stopping in frame
he holds up an american express card in a black gloved hand
the american express card
dont steal home without it
filing into cleveland municipal stadium
tickets being ripped programs sold etc
swinging and hitting a home run into the left field seats
beating the tom toms and whooping it up
the shot widens to reveal theyre no longer alone in the stands
nailing up another pair of gloves above his head
there are a lot of them up there now
on the road again
everyones asleep except taylor who lies across his seat heating pads on his knees
watching tv in a cleveland working class bar
also cheering the indians are several punk and heavy metal kids their faces painted with indian war paint
hitting a prodigious home run onto the roof
standing up to cheer cerranos homer then remembering hes with rachel
he sits down apologetically
rachel watches the events on the field with a face of cold steel
hitting a double into the right centerfield alley with two runners on
hayes the trailing runner catches up with the lead runner and they reach the plate at about the same time one sliding around the catcher one way one around the
both score as the catcher tries to tag both and gets neither
going wild while the indian mascot dances on top of the dugout
the program in progress is suddenly interrupted by a sports break logo appearing on the screen
we interrupt this program to bring you the following special bulletin
live outside the indians locker room
he wears a headdress warpaint and a wild thing t shirt
good evening everybody
the incredible has happened
the indians have finished the regular season in a first place tie with the new york yankees on the strength of a win over the tigers in detroit today
there will be a one game playoff here in cleveland the day after tomorrow to decide the eastern division championship the indians having won the coin flip held just moments
ago in the american league office
well have further details on the news at but for now get your tomahawks ready cleveland
we hear cheers as its ripped away to reveal the photographic image of rachels cleavage
we pull back to see the life size poster is now completely peeled
rachel stares out at us in a g string and tassels
the photo is obviously from her showgirl days
general merriment prevails in the locker room
players shaking hands back slapping etc
hayes comes by to exchange congratulations with taylor
music and montage end
hey not bad for a has been and a never will be
we havent won anything yet
we still got one more to go
dorn comes by taylors locker
hey taylor theres a coupla drop dead annies outside
one of em says she used to know you pretty good
brunette great rack
what doya say we chat em up
without much enthusiasm i dont know
cmon youre not gonna keep moonin over that library chick are you
forget her shes gone
we leave taylor thinking it over
suzanne dorn is watching the oclock news
hal charles is holding forth
the indians are spending the night in detroit and will bus back to cleveland in the morning
were going to go back now to ross farmer whos standing by at the hotel stanley where the indians are staying in detroit
the scene shifts to
where ross farmer stands microphone in hand
behind him several players can be seen partying in the bar
thank you hal
as you can see the indians are in high spirits tonight looking forward to their showdown with the yankees
who will start that game is still a matter of some conjecture
as ross talks dorn walks into the frame in the far background with his arm around a young lovely
theyre nuzzling and hugging unaware theyre on camera albeit in the background
suzanne doesnt miss it though
she moves closer to the screen to get a better look
dorn and the girl get in an elevator together obviously going upstairs
as the elevator closes suzanne hits the off button
she sits there a second in shock and then her face begins to harden
taylor and darla are undressing preparatory to getting into bed
they are definitely no strangers to each other
you still got that black corvette
the one that the sound system took up the whole trunk
no i had to sell it
i thought they gave them to ya
not after your knees go bad
thats all right youll be gettin a new one now
darla is down to her bra and panties
she puts her leg up on the bed to unhook her stockings
taylor is about to take off his pants but stops
darla i dont think i can do this
what do you mean
we did this between innings once
i guess im just not that guy anymore
darla looks at him a long beat
resigned happens to the best of them sooner or later
whats her name
the door opens and darla comes out fully clothed now
she turns to say goodbye to jake who is still bare chested
so long jake
i was gonna devote a whole chapter to you in my book
as darla gives jake a goodbye peck the elevator door opens across the hall and out steps lynn
shes obviously rattled by the sight of taylor and darla together
i was in town for a conference and thought id drop by but i can see youre busy
with that she quickly steps back into the elevator and the doors close
taylor leaps to the elevator door but its too late
he then sprints to the end of the hall and down the stairs
running down the stairs and into the lobby
seeing no sign of lynn he races out the front door to see her pulling out in a taxi
he can only stand and watch her disappear into the night
we pick up vaughn making his way to the back of the bus where brown has his office on the last seat
most of the other players are asleep after a late night of partying
you wanted to see me
i just wanted to tell you that im startin harris tomorrow against the yankees even though its your turn in the rotation
vaughn says nothing but hes clearly disappointed
hes got more experience and a little better record against the yankees
whatevers best for the team
dont read anything into it rick
youre one of the guys that got us here
vaughn turns and walks back up the aisle
brown watches him go knowing hes still upset
the indian bus pulls up outside the stadium where a group of several thousand fans wait
the players are showered with cheers and applause as they file out
vaughn sits in the bar alone nursing a beer still troubled by his demotion
he hears a sexy voice behind him
you mind if i join you
vaughn turns around to see suzanne dorn
shes dressed to draw blood looking better than weve ever seen her
she slides into the booth
i dont think id be very good company tonight
vaughn falls silent
suzanne stares at him with a devastating combination of sexual heat and tender admiration
shes pulling out all the stops
vaughns a little flustered
im ah a ball player
i know but thats not why i came over
i dont chase ball players
why did you come over then
because youre the sexiest man ive ever laid eyes on and you look like you could use a
we go to vaughn
hes a goner
vaughn has dozed off in the bed
suzanne is getting dressed
vaughn wakes up as she finishes
where you goin
ive gotta get home
i didnt even get your name
suzanne dorn having heard that name someplace before suzanne dorn
kissing him on the forehead so long
youre a great kid
with that she walks on out leaving vaughn dazed by the knowledge of who hes just slept with
taylor is coming back from the bathroom down the hall as suzanne comes out of vaughns room
nonchalant hello jake
taylor is amazed by what hes just seen
as soon as suzanne is out of sight he goes to vaughns room and opens the door
vaughn is sitting on his bed in a state of disbelief
i swear to god i didnt know who she was
taylor nods that its all right even though he doesnt believe it
sequence omitted from original script
pulling up outside the church
lynn is helped out of the car by her father
as she starts up the steps she sees that both sides are lined by the entire cleveland indians team in uniform
they form an arch of bats as she passes
at the top of the steps is taylor
lynn stops as her father ushers her mother on into the church
you look beautiful
i didnt think youd come
i cant stay
indicating the team we gotta get to the park
good luck today jake
yeh you too
pause tell me one thing
the night you came up to my hotel was there really a library conference
no i came to see you
too bad it didnt work out better
i just wanna say im sorry for all the things ive put you through over the years
even for last night
cant be sorry for that
he says this with absolute conviction
despite herself lynn senses that hes telling the truth
then you werent defending my honor again
i didnt have to
she knew she was outclassed
he gives her a kiss and watches as she goes inside
he stands there a long beat then turns and walks slowly down the steps past his teammates
rachel is looking out at the empty stadium
theres a knock at the door
the door is opened by a male secretary and in steps lou brown
hello lou what can i do for ya
lou puts a folded piece of paper on her desk
i wanted to hand in my resignation before you had a chance to fire me
what do you mean
i know what you been tryin to do with this team
after the season i want no part of it
well i knew i could count on charlie to tell somebody
i was just afraid he might take too long
why would you want him to tell somebody
so youd tell the team hopefully getting them mad enough to knock themselves out trying to prove they belonged in this league
i think it worked
you tryin to make me believe you wanted us to win all along
what about the plane the bus the bad hotels
we were broke
we couldnt afford anything better
donald left the team nearly bankrupt
if wed had another losing season i would have had to sell the team
i knew we couldnt win with the team we had so i decided to bring in new players and see how theyd do with the proper motivation
there was never any offer from miami
i made it all up
why should i believe any of this
now that were winnin its easy for you to jump on the bandwagon
if id really wanted you to lose all i had to do was send the best players back to the minors
but i didnt did i
brown has no comeback for this
he knows now that shes telling the truth
you think this was all an accident
i personally scouted every member of this team except hayes of course
he was a surprise
they all had flaws which concealed their real talent or i wouldnt have been able to get them
but i knew if anyone could straighten them out you could
and if you tell them any of this i will fire you
brown can only shake his head at this whole thing
i love this team lou
go get em tonight
the two shake hands
brown looks at rachel a beat still looking for some sign of duplicity
finally he gives her a grudging smile of respect
taylor hayes vaughn and the others are getting ready to board the bus to the stadium
taylor pulls vaughn aside
i dont know what dorns wife is up to but i think itd be best if you dressed early and got out to the bullpen before dorn comes in
to taylor we got a problem
cerrano wants some extra power for tonight
hes lookin to sacrifice a live chicken

some carry plastic scalps with yankee hats on them
others have caps with the european no insignia superimposed over a door mat
in the press box

starkly quiet in contrast to the stadium outside
each player has retreated into his own world of concentration

warming up in the bullpen
the tension of starting such an important game shows in his face
hello everybody harry doyle bidding you a wahoo welcome from beautiful municipal stadium where tonight before a capacity crowd of screaming featherheads the braves of the cuyahoga will leave their
teepees in search of clevelands first league championship in over years
standing in the way their long time nemesis the new york yankees the big boys of broadway who have beaten the indians like a tom tom all year long
down in the dugout the players are lined up ready to take the field
they exchange words of encouragement hand slaps clenched fists but all at a very low key level
this is tension time
all right guys lets take it to em
the indians charge onto the field to a standing ovation
in the center field bleachers thelmas victory blanket containing the scores of every indian game for the season hangs from a railing

harris comes set and delivers
the yankee hitter burton l swings and gets all of it

deep center field
hayes climbs up on the wall but its long gone
its off the reservation home run
and the yankees lead it
donovan is a little confused by this
burton trots around the bases and is greeted by jubilant teammates at the plate
a silent pall falls on the stadium
as the goes up on the scoreboard we
popping up and flinging his bat away in frustration
we take cuts of the worried fans chewing fingernails wadding up programs hanging their heads etc
grounding out obviously having trouble running
we take cuts of worried faces on the bench
stepping into the batters box
the crowd is practically sitting on its hands now
hope draining away
dorn up now two down bottom of the seventh
the indians running out of chances
dorn swings at the first pitch and lines a sharp single to left
the crowd and the indian bench suddenly come alive
cerrano moves to the plate

the crowd and bleacher band begins to clap as dorn takes his lead
cerrano swings at the first pitch and misses
an audible groan goes through the crowd
the yankee pitcher gets set again and throws cerrano a big roundhouse curve
he misses it a foot
damn havin trouble with the curve ball again

cerrano gets back in the box and digs in
the yankee pitcher comes to his stretch and delivers

downtown welcome to the happy hunting ground
the game is tied
the fans go crazy as cerrano circles the bases
rachel jumps out of her seat hands above her head
donovan hesitates a beat then follows suit
cerrano carries his bat with him holding it high above his head
as cerrano disappears into the dugout we go to the scoreboard as the goes up
two down in the top of the ninth still tied at harris working on an eight hitter
lining a single to right field
harris mops his brow obviously tiring
smashing a double off the wall the lead runner stopping at third
brown signals to the bullpen to get somebody warm
on the mound looking like hes out of gas
activity continues in the pen as harris is really digging himself a hole now
he got the first two hitters and then gave up a single and a double and has now gone to cheevers
harris comes set and fires to the plate
its way high
high ball four and theyre loaded for haywood the biggest indian killer of them all
brown has seen enough
he makes his way to the mound
taking the ball from harris you pitched a hell of a game steve

brown signals to the bullpen with his left hand
give me vaughn
surprised you want vaughn
i know he hasnt done real well against this guy but i got a hunch hes due
striding in from the bullpen
he doesnt look relaxed
as he nears the infield he purposely doesnt look at dorn
dorn stares at him with undisguised venom
as vaughan gets to the mound he sees patton getting his convict uniform on in the yankee dugout
he looks away to see haywood in the on deck circle smiling out at him
meanwhile the crowd has gone nuts at the sight of vaughn
bobby vic and johnny are blasting out wild thing on the tom toms and the whole stadium strong is singing it
doyle just pushes the mic forward and lets the crowd do its work

brown and taylor leave vaughn alone on the mound the singing of the crowd ringing in his ears
vaughn has finished his warmup and were ready to

vaughn watches him come with fear and trepidation
seeing it oh shit
dorn arrives at the mound and holds out his hand for the ball
vaughn gives it to him
dorn rubs it up staring long and hard into vaughns eyes
vaughn is sweating bullets
finally dorn speaks

he smiles and hands vaughn the ball back
vaughn returns the smile and accepts the ball
while dorn trots back to his position vaughn turns his back to the plate for one last moment of concentration
as he turns around to face us we see a new man as the wicked opening chords of xs wild thing are heard on the track only louder and more
savage than before
vaughn steps up on the rubber his face hardened into fierce resolve
theres nothing nervous about him now

haywood pulls the trigger but its already by him

once again the crowd comes to life
the yankee manager comes to the mound and waves for a new pitcher
and horton is wasting no time
hes goin to the duke
out of the pen comes billy duke a good facsimile of goose gossage only duke is bigger and meaner
duke leads the league in saves strikeouts per inning and nose hairs
the duke finishes his warmups and stares over at hayes
hayes smiles snaps his black gloves out of his hip pocket and carefully pulls them on over his hands
the duke does not care for this kind of showmanship

taylor is pointing to the bleachers calling his shot
the crowd electrified by taylors gesture remains on its feet
duke stares in at taylor comes to his stretch and then lets go a steaming fast ball right at taylors head
taylor goes down in a swirl of dust the ball missing him by inches
the stadium explodes with boos but as soon as taylor picks himself up the crowd begins to roar again
bobby vic and johnny are pounding out a heavy beat on the tom toms
everyone in the stadium begins to clap in unison with the drums
taylor steps back in and once again points to the bleachers

framed against the cleveland skyline
in several of the lit windows we see people banging things or clapping
duke gets back on the hill
getting the sign he wants he comes to his stretch checking hayes at second
as duke starts his delivery to the plate we go to slow motion
the clapping in the stadium stops as everyone hushes to watch the pitch
theyve all stopped too in anticipation of the pitch
everything from here on will continue to be in slow motion
as duke whips his arm toward the plate hayes takes off for third
taylor instead of swinging away shortens up on the bat and bunts dukes pitch down the third base line
the yankee third baseman caught completely unaware charges the ball frantically
barreling down the line toward first on his sore legs giving it everything hes got
scooping up the ball barehanded and firing on the run to first
pounding down the line
he strains for the bag as the yankee first baseman stretches to his limit for the throw
taylor and the ball arrive at almost the same time
taylor hits the bag and then sprawls in the dirt as his knees give out
the umpire brings up his arms and spreads them wide
