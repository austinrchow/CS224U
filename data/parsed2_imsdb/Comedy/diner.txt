written by barry levinson the screen is black
we hear muffled rock and roll music
then we read fenwick walks along the dimly lit basement
heavy wiatei coats hang from hooks on the wall
in the b
there is constant traffic of pecple coming and going from the rest rooms
from above we hear the muffled sotjv of the fenwick is in his early s and dressed in the joe college
style of the late fifties
sports jacket button down shirt chino pants and bass weejuns
we sense that he is a little lost in himself confused
he looks out one of the windows that views the parking lot
then without any outward anger he punches his fist through a window pane
seconds later he breaks another window with his fist
fenwick picking up the music beat from above struts to the sound as he approaches another bank of windows
he calmly breaks another window pane with
a guy coming out of the bathroom in the b
sees fenwicks actions and then heads up the steps
the crowd is gathered around the bandstand listening to the local group the sh k rs playing their popular hit hot nuts
the song is played toward the end of the even ing because of its risque lyrics
hot nuts hot nuts get from the peanut man
hot nuts hot nuts get em any way you can
as the crowd swings the verse back to the band leader
the guy who spotted fenwick breaking windows approaches boogie
boogie is something of a dandy flashiar in dress than others in his crowd
although he isnt particularly good looking there is something about his attitude that is very appealing to girls
boogie aster hearing the guy heads downstairs
fenwick casually breaks another window with his fist
his hand is bleeding
whats up fen
just breaking windows boog what for
its a smile
he breaks another window with his fist
c mon dont be a swuck
i know that glass is made from sand but how come you can see through it
he breaks another window
boogie grabs him
leave the windows alone
whats the matter with you
its a smile thats all
im cracking up
you fen break another window and youre gonna get a fat lip
he lets fenwick go

the band is on a break
a frank sinatra record is playing
cap ra pans to eddie who is in a corner with one foot up on a chair
he smokes a cigarette and taps his foot lightly to the music
eddie takes sinatra very seriously
shbevi approaches eddie
talking with your wife about the fucking wedding plans

boogie is talking with dlane the young eleventh grader that fenwick had the falling out with
she is an attractive petite girl with large breasts

diane is in the car
fenwick is telling her scnething and she laughs boogie and mode t follow
behind them shrevie and his wife beth follow in a hudson hornet
fenwick floors his car and disappears around a bend
the other cars do not keep pace
elyse feels that eddie is getting very sensitive about the wedding
i k ow
we were talking about it
she thinks that since he never talked it over with billy beforehand it kind of bothers him even more
the closest of the close
ow billys flying in this morning
i didnt hear about it
thought he was just coming in for the wedding day
we didnt want to mention it
surprise for eddie
shrevies car follows in the taillights of boogies car
fenwicks car is nowhere in sight
elyses mother is very upset with eddie
they picked out a yellow and white motif for the wedding
you know like we did tablecloth napkins maids of honor
anyway eddie objected
he wanted blue and white because thats the colts colors
refused to give in
well you know how stubborn eddie is
could be worse
it could be black and gold
shrevie notices boogies taillights come or
he slows down
something is wrong up ahead
cadside night fenwicks car is turned over
the headlights of the car shine brightly against a tree
ficult to see exactly what has happeried
jn the darkness of the road
boogie modell shrevie and beta exit the cars and walk toward the accident
as they approach we see fe zwick lying halfway out of the car covered in blood
diane cannot be seen
the three guys move apprehensively toward the car
fenwicks face is covered inblood so touch so that it can hardly be recognized
eac ting to the sight of fenwicks oh jesus
boogie kaeels nest to fenwick
after a beat
fenwick explodes with laughter

fenwick screams in laughter
then boogie laughs
the rest of the guys join in

our engine prop comes into vi view astt rates its approach
the plane sails inches off the runway and then touches down
a moveable stairway is put in place
seconds later the hatch opens passengers depart walking down the steps in the cold night air
billy halpert steps forward into the doorway
billy in his early s a d wears the typical button down shirt crew neck sweater chino pants and the bass weejuns
he starts down the steps and heads toward the terminal
as he enters billy exits the building carrying a suitcase

fen wick nudgeseddie and then whispers some thing
into his ear
carols hand dips into the popcorn box on boogies lap and takes out a handful of popcorn
shrevie seated in the back is restless wondering what iz happening

carols hand again reaches into the box and takes out a few kernels
boogies eyes glance toward fenwick
fenwick shakes his
head and mouths bets off
boogie nods yes
troy and sandra walk the beach
the romantic score swells
the yotzia audience is caught up in this screen love affair
carol reaches into the popcorn box once again
suddenly she screaws
she bolts up from her seat and races up the aisle
the audience iq alive with chatter war wondering what has happened
boogie turns to fenwick and smiles
then he heads ue the aisle after carol
as she watches boogie racing up the aisle after whats going on
i dont know

the guy goes down
a crowd quickly forms
confusion takes over as everyone moves to see what has happened

r t wish i k ew what to do
im not real good at talking to girls when theres problems and all

bowies car is culled over
beths door is openand she stands on the curb talking to boogie inside the car
what are you going to do about the money
boogie szugs his shoulders and smiles at her take care babe
beth closes the door boogie drives his desoto away
btth watches him as he disappears down the street
strip joint nigit bil ly and eddie are in one of the clubs on baltimores famous block
in the b
a bored stripper goes through
the mo tions
the drier thz
ps out a monotonous beat and a saxophonist drones away a few sailors and some other customers sit at cables around the stage area
all t h e tables have wooden a
when the stripper does something they especially like they pound the table with tr
billy and eddie both have beers and chasers in front of then
billy sips the chaser and his body actually shakes from it for a few seconds
there is no reason to actually like this you know that
an acquired taste no matter how long i drink whiskey i still dont like it
he takes another sip and once again shakes
then he sips the beer
now beers another story
eccie watches t e stri pa zn owing a few bps an g in s
you know something
i dont iike strippers
i mean so they show a little here and there
but give me a coc
rle of ranoosas in a pink sweater
remember the first time we became aware of breasts on girls
showed up for the new school year and there they were
we gave little joel cher i a nickel apiece to find cut is they were real
told him to be slnbcle
he walked over reached uc and grabbed
t rned to us and yelled theyre real
the whole thing with girls is painfu
and it keeps getting acre painful
instead of easier
billy downs his beer and orders tt o more
remember copping a feel
boogie was the first
said it was great
so when i tcck out ruth ray i figured i had to do it
ruth ray eighth grade
sat on the couch in her club cellar for hours trying to figure out a way to get my arm arc tzid her
finally i learned the move
i yawned and put my arm around her shoulder
he demonstrates on eddie
then came the big task of getting my hand down to her breast
by the time i worked un the nerve to move down i realized my arm was asleep
figured out there wasnt enough time to take it back ge the feeling again acid start over
had to be in by eleven
time was running out
so i move toward the breast with my arm asleep
my first copping a feel was like this
he bangs his limp arm against eddies chest
he bps it again
next time i saw the guys they said did you cop a feel
i said yeah
how was it
eddie laughs and billy joins in
bocgie pulls into te diner parking lot
fenwick and shrevie race over to the car
boogie opens the door
bong you should get outta here
boogie gets out of the car and slams the door shut
he looks coward the diner and thinks a moment
tiny con ycu wait until he splits
hell just keep looking for me
he starts toward the diner
might as well play the cards
the guys hang behind
boogie continufts on
inside the diner we see tank moving along the aisle toward the door boogie heads for the door
just as he reaches it tank steps outside
the bagel just raid off your debt
boogie looks at him trying to size up the situation
wcnderirg if hes r ning a nurbey for scale reason
thats the story
tank starts past boogie
tank tu s
boogie slams his fist into his stcwach
tank drops to one knee in pain
i still owed you that
he enters the diner
fenwick and shrevie are amazed by what just happened
boogia approaches bagel wl o sits at a booth alone
he thanks bagel
your mother called
she was frantic
so out of respect for your f at
he sips his coffee
i picks up a toasted bagel and butters it
your mother feels youre just wasting your t e in law school its not for you
ccee to work for me
theres a lot of money to be made in the home improvement business

boogie thinks about it
bagel chews on his bagel

but what the hell
i can always lie
the waitress passes
enid some french fries and gravy

he flashes him a smile
strip joint night billy and eddie are still dri king at the bar

billy listens to the music slapping his thighs crying be get the band to pick up the beat
idle wi fe wants you to get new friends
cause me and you have secrets shell never know
and new friends can never be as good cause weve got a history
it wont change only if we let it
billy keeps slapping his thighs but the dr
mmer and the saxophonist continue on unaware of billys private urgings
iilcd f nti yirg
this is getting me crazy
billy goes toward the small stage
come on guyst pick up the beat
they dont respond
eddie sits at the bar amused
billy claps his hands to a strong rhythm but of course the guys pay no attention
billy goes up on the stage and pulls a cover off a small piano in the corner
he sits down and runs his fingers down the keyboard then starts to play
it bas a nice pleasant sound to it
the dr er and the saxophonist stop not knowing what to do
the stripper also stops
the club bouncer at the front door turns toward the stage notices something is wrong and makes his way forward
billys piano playing becomes more intense
he drives the keys hard
full tilt rock ane roll
the sound becomes infectious
the sailors and other customers pick up the beat
one after another they start to pound the tables with the wooden mallets
eddie moves toward the stage banging empty beer battles together
the saxophonist joins billy
then the dry
the stripper stands by the side of the stage watching
the music builds
billys fingers pound the piano
eddie jl ps up on the stage and starts dancing around
he grabs the stripper and they jitterbug
the sailors and other customers are cn their feet banging the mallets cr
the tables for all they are worth
a room full of dr
the lemon heightens
billy kicks back the stool a la jerry lee lewis
the crowd cheers
the bouncer cheers along
the saxophonist struts the stage playing his heart out
the drer drives the bass dr
m with his foot
his hands sweep back and forth across the skins
eddies feet are flying
enthusiasm over grace
the scrip per is a whirlwind of motion and sexuality
the tempo is fierce
ril i lmi ikc tztt
sc builds and bu lds and t
en altogether they s u

they are enjoying one another

benefit of the doubt
i love weddings

or wanted to

billy thinks about that as they enter an all ciaht cootee shop
billy eddie and the stripper sit in q
booth by the win dow eating drinking and laeeahing
the first rays of morning light are breaking behind the building
the ca ra keeps e cr
countryside day vn cc
ishol rides her horse across the gently rolling hills
the ho l se and her are one grace and bra she rides out of f e
seconds later boogie rides a horse into fr
he pulls up on the horse and cc
es to a stop
he watches ann ride then pulls up his collar on his wool overcoat and rides off
boogie rides after ann
although he is not a goad rider he pushes to pick up ground
finally he pulls alongside
ann slows her horse and boogie does the same
yes it is
mornings ive always felt are a good time to ride
ann doesnt respond
f you live around here
not around here
boogie looks around what seems like endless ccun yside
hes over whelmed
which means you are trespassing
boogie looks her in the eye and flashes his smile
i was wait ng for an invite
ann studies him
she kicks her horse and gallops off
boogie follows as they ride away from camera
whats your name
as in bobby shef tel
they ride over a crest and disappear from sight
the wedding rcom has been elaborately decorated
potted blue and white flowers in stands line the aisle to the blue and white flower d altar
the room is a festival of blue
the guests sit in fold
ng chairs eagerly waiting for the wedding procession to begin
the music begins
however it is not the traditional wedding math but rather the baltimore coltsfight song
even though the organist has softened it there is still a rah rah quality to it
the flower girl comes down the aisle throwing white flowers on the blue aisle
modell with his girlfriend
what is that music
colt marching song
sounds good huh
the ushers come for ar
boogie and fenwick followed by shrevie who walks alone
they are all smartly dressed in black tuxedos
the bridesmaids come forward
beth and another girl
fol lowed by tao more girls
followed by two more girls
billy and eddie start down the aisle
behind them is eddies mother and father
they walk on either side of his grandmother
the colt ing song continues on
eddie sees someone sitting one seat in from the aisle
he whispers to billy
td t rh
b l k otter
as they start to pass billy leans into the row and grabs moon shaw by the shirt
he pulls back his fist
jxoor is shocked
he smiles lets him go and rejoins eddie having missed only a few steps
no one is quite sure what has happened
quickly the attention is back to the wedding procession
as elyse and her mother and father come down the ai s le
do you edward take this woman elyse to be your lawful wedded wife
for better or worse in sickness and in health
until death do you part

the six piece band plays a nice perky dance t ne
some women dance with women
mothers dance with sons fathers and daughters and some husbands with wives
shrevie dances with beth and they seem to be enjoying themselves

thats not going to be easy
i know the baby is ours billy
we can both celebrate that
you can love him just as much spend time with him or her
boogie and ann pass then boogie kisses ann lightly on the cheek
you know what i realized just yesterday
ive been intimidated by you
i always liked you because you were strong independent and all
but ive been intimidated by that as well
ive always held
back with you
when we kissed i held back
the same when we made luve in new york
i keep thinking i have to be special like normal passion wasnt proper
as if it were just too ordinary and we were beyond that
barbara pulls away from him slightly so she can see his face
theres a sad look in his eyes
if thats the case think thats a hard thing to she kisses him they hold each other tightly weve got plenty of time to find out about one another
plenty of time
they stand still on tha dance floor nsothers dance around them
elyse stands with her back to the holding the bouquet up toward the eagerl await she tosses the bouquet from the stage
seated at the table they look down at the bouquet then at boogie there is a faint smile on their faces
