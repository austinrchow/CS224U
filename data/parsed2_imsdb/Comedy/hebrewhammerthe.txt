written by jonathan kesselman over black we hear the first few bars of jingle bells
the music morphs into an ominous score
with a thunderous boom comes a title card reading hanukkah we start on jesus on a crucifix and then violently crane down to reveal mordechai a timid little hasidic boy
standing nervously at the foot of the statue
behind morty is a wall with the graffiti phrase hanukkah is homos scrawled across it
he clutches his sandy koufax lunchbox tightly as he looks off into the distance
hes got quite a large bulge in his pants for a child his age
we see a menacing extremely wide angle shot of the school
superimposed over the picture are the words st
peter mordechai takes a deep breath and walks towards the school
mordechai walks past a row of bleachers occupied by four hey mordechai look
i dropped a penny
he drops a penny
the other children cackle
the gentile girl next to him holds up a bag of bagels
want a bagel
gentile boy feigns choking
hey jew nose save some oxygen for us
morty attempts to take it all in stride
we push into gentile girl a severe looking puritanically dressed child as she turns to face the camera
hey morty my mom says that unless your people wise up and accept jesus christ as your lord and savior youre all going to burn in hell
the other children exchange now that went a little over the line looks
the silence is broken by the sound of the schoolbell
morty gathers himself and walks off
as morty holds a small gift wrapped box in his hands we hear a tinny version of the song dreidel dreidel dreidel
he tears open the wrapping paper to reveal a dreidel
he looks at his gift and then looks off screen
we pan with his look to reveal
a group of christian children congregating around a large garishly decorated christmas tree
a very vegas merry christmas sign flashes as a larger than life hi fi version of the christmas song jingle bells blares
the children festively slap high fives as they open their presents
we cut to a slow motion cu of gentile boy enamored with his brand new atc motorbike
we cut to a slow motion cu of gentile girl
she wears an i love jesus t shirt and holds an adorable dog with a bow affixed to its head in her arms
it licks her on the face
we cut back to mordechai
he looks down at his pathetic excuse for a present
hes on the verge of tears
gentile boy calls to mordechai as he drives his atc
look what mordechai got
nice spinning top morty
the other children take notice of mordechais gift and begin to laugh
mordechai is crushed
highsmith s an incredibly waspy teacher puts down her copy of modern w
and appears genuinely concerned by the teasing mordechai has weathered
she walks over to comfort him
now now class lets not make fun of mordechais spinning top
we need to all learn the importance of tolerance and understanding
isnt that right mordechai
so class in honor of mordechais special day id like for all of us to wish morty a heartfelt merry
she looks to mordechai for confirmation on the word
stumbling cha noo kuh day
in unison the class attempts to repeat the words but all suffer various degrees of pronunciation problems
very good class
i hope youve all learned an important lesson today
just because mordechais people are different from us
just because they might appear strange to us with their furry hats their beady eyes and their long sideburns
not to mention their bizarre customs and unnecessarily guttural funny sounding names
just because they control all of the worlds money yet are too cheap to buy their children anything better than spinning tops for presents does not mean that we cant
learn to respect and love them as our equals
she squeezes his cheek
happy chanoo juah kah day morty
a reaction shot of the mortified morty
a sullen mordechai wanders the streets
absurd xmas decorations horrific in their appearance blanket the street
morty glances a grotesque faux reindeer with fangs
we hear a growling noise as it lights up
he walks quickly away in fear past
we track with morty as he passes a storefront window
inside the clerk turns a sign outwards reading jews not welcome
we continue with morty as he passes by a second storefront
a similar sign reading kykes go home is turned outwards by another clerk
he continues past yet another building as a sign reading monotheists need not apply is displayed by a third clerk for mortys benefit
morty looks across the street
a sign hangs from a storefront reading jews ok for about minutes
the fourth clerk gives him the thumbs up
morty finds a spot on the sidewalk outside the building and pulls out his dreidel
he spins it and we hold on the spinning top for a few beats as morty stares at in wonderment
suddenly a huge black boot comes crashing down into frame and smashes the little dreidel
mordechai slowly looks up
a menacing santa claus gives him the finger and exits frame as we hear him sadistically laugh o
the words ho ho ho at morty
we start close on mordechai
rage fills every inch of his face
as we slowly crane away the opening credits begin as the hebrew hammer theme song kicks into full gear
as the jewxploitation music pumps metallic slashes rip through the screen line by line spinning into place to form a star of david
the title the hebrew hammer slams into frame
we start close on a gift wrapped hanukkah present
we pull back a bit as mordechai jefferson carver aka the hebrew hammer a baaad jewish brother spins the package in his hands as he saunters down the street past
a latke stand
hes a semitic super stud straight out of a s blaxploitation flick
he tosses the gift to maccabee a young hasidic boy
happy hanukkah maccabee
macabee tears open the wrapping paper and holds up the gift a hebrew hammer action figure
we cut back to the hammer as he smiles back
we hear maccabee say
the hammer smiles back and walks off frame
we begin on the hammers black boots and slowly tilt up as we dolly back with him
the hammer passes a line of three jewish princesses who swoon as he passes
he stops below the sign of a butcher shop that reads kosher meat
we push into his close up as he blows them all a kiss
the pubic area of their dresses moisten in synchrony
the hammer winks back
an old woman calls to the hammer from the window of a second story flat
hammer why dont you come eat by us for shabat
my miriam is all grown up now
god willing you should settle down and marry
we punch in to a close up of a demure miriam as the hammer takes stock of the goods
she is an atrociously ugly girl wearing orthodontic headgear and bespectacled with a pair oversized librarians glasses
the hammer shakes off his wave of nausea
thanks for the invite mrs
kleinman but right now g dash ds the only one for me
i can dig it
the hammer continues on down the street
the old woman and miriam are framed in the bg
hammer youre the baaddest hebe this side of tel aviv
the hammer stops for a second and smiles at the compliment
to himself shabat shalom
he walks off frame
some teenage gentile boys play keep away with a yarmulke belonging to shlomo another young hasidic kid
give it back
give me back my yarmulke
hey teddy throw me the frisbee
teddy the non speaking teen gentile throws the yarmulke and we follow it as it spins towards another teenage gentile
the other teenage gentile excitedly extends his hands to catch but right before it reaches him another hand comes into frame and snatches it
he looks up and we cut to his
pov as we tilt up to reveal the hammer
he looks pretty damn big and pissed off from this angle
the teenage gentile begins to shake and stammer
we were going to give it back
i swear to god
did you just take gods name in vain
its not like that
we were just about
just about to leave right
yeah yeah thats right
we were just about to leave
the two run off
the hammer looks down to shlomo
his spirit seems broken
sometimes i wonder why i even bother praying to one god
be proud of who you are
youre a bad bold big nosed biblical brother
you feelin me
the kids morale is boosted
aveenooh shalom alechem little brother
the hammer pounds his fist into his chest ala the black panthers
the kid returns the gesture
the hammer points at him as he leaves
the hammer walks up the stairs and past the sign advertising his office
the hammer theme music winds down punctuated with shaft like brass hits
however the brass hits become incredibly overblown and extraneous
the hammer walks back into frame from the stairway to his office
he looks around strangely for the source of the music
tikkva late s the hammers very nasaly laawng island secretary files her nails furiously as the hammer enters the office
a muzak version of the hammer theme song plays over the office pa system
happy hanukkah tikva
happy hanukkah morty
the hammer tosses his shtreml and we whip with it as lands squarely on the hat rack
we cut back to the hammer
hes wearing a yarmulke
so whats shakin yenta
well for stahters your mother called
she said to remind you that youre having shabat dinner by her tomorrow and also to remind you to bring the manischewitz and she wanted me to relate the following
information to you
okay whats the information
she said to remind you that youre having shabat dinner by her tomorrow and also to remind you to bring the manischewitz
the hammer lets this sink in
yeah im going to be out of the office from to on sunday
i have a terrible yeast infection and i need to see my gynecologist
but were not open on sundays
i understand that
i just thought that you might want to know
beat ill be in my office
the hammer walks into his private office and shuts the frosted glass door
we hold on whats stenciled on the outside of the door
the lettering reads mordechai jefferson carver certified circumcised dick state of new york
an establishing shot of santas workshop
the lettering north pole santas workshop is superimposed over the picture
i want to start by thanking all of you for pulling yourselves away from the workshop to make this emergency meeting
i know its the busiest time of the year for all of you so ill try and be brief
as santa speaks we begin on a painting of a meek and frightened looking santa claus
his eyes look fearfully to his right
below the picture frame is a plaque reading st
nick the nervous
we continue a slow dolly to the right on to the next picture
we see another santa claus much more treacherous in his appearance
his eyes are fixed menacingly on the picture of santa to his left
the plaque below his picture read st
nick the nasty
we continue our dolly to the right finally ending on a painting of a jolly portly santa
below his picture the plaque reads st
nick the nice
we cut to a wide shot of a conference room
the same nice santa claus from the last picture addresses a handful of elves
two reindeer flank santa on either side
their nameplates hang from their necks blitzen and rudolph
at the other end of the table from santa sits his son damian quite a nasty looking man
my father often referred to as st
nick the nasty was a tyrannical man
he was obsessed with making christmas the only holiday anyone could celebrate before the new year
since his death ive prided myself on ensuring that the christmas season is one of tolerance and understanding between all races and religions
its always been my belief that hanukkah and kwanzaa deserve the same respect as christmas
damian whispers to an elf on his right hand side and then makes the jerking off motion with his hand
as rudolphs nose dims so do the lights in the room
santa picks up a remote in his hand and turns on a slide over the course of my career as santa claus ive made it my mission to ensure that
jews christians and african americans could all observe their respective holidays in harmony
we see a slide of the hebrew hammer an african american man mohammed and santa claus arm in arm below a banner in a mall reading happy holidays
i was responsible for pushing the happy holidays ordinance in which all merry christmas signage was replaced by the trans relgious and inoffensive phrase happy holidays
we see another slide in which an assembly of schoolchildren are singing
it was nearly a decade ago in conjunction with our friends in the jewish and african american communities that i supported a bill that mandated that dreidel dreidel dreidel and
im dreaming of a bright kwanzaa be taught and sung in elementary schools along with the christmas standards frosty the snowman and deck the halls
which is why upon examination of my annual naughty and nice list it shocked me to discover that my own son damian
damian preoccupied with the cigarette hes attempting to light looks up in response to his name
a brown bagged bottle of booze now sits on the table in front of him
we can see santa and the reindeer in silhouette on the slide projection screen behind him
the heir to the red suit could be so filled with hate
santa addresses damian
damian when i learned of your ludicrous scheme to wipe out hanukkah my first reaction was one of disgust
now im only filled with sadness and disappointment
disappointed that i failed to teach you the true meaning of christmas
what do you have to say for yourself
we being a slow push into damian as he ponders the question
the cigarette dangles from his lips
rudolph nods to blitzen
blitzen returns the gesture with a nod of acknowledgment
with a slow and measured pace damian says
on the slide projector screen behind damian we see the silhouetted images of blitzen and rudolph goring santa through the chest with their antlers
blood trickles from santas mouth and with his last breath he utters the words
et tu blitzen
santa falls out of frame with a thud
standing behind him with bloodied antlers is blitzen
damian walks over to the newly deceased santa takes his bloodstained santas hat and put it on his own head
from this point on in the screenplay damian will now be referred to as santa
the elves in the room in various stages of shock stare at their new master in horror
what are you fucking midgets looking at
get back to work
we have hanukkah to destroy
a building resembling the pentagon with the exception that its shaped like the star of david
superimposed over the picture are the words jewish defense league
a smoky chamber reminiscent of the senate or the united nations
a giant banner reading hanukkah now
illustrated with a hasid in silhouette with his fist raised covers the back wall behind the men
as with the senate house committee various factions of the jdl sit behind plaques describing the group they represent
we see members from the anti defamation league jews against drunk driving etc
a chair belonging to the coalition of jewish athletes is empty
the floor is chaotic
the jdl chief bangs his gavel and yells
his pleas for silence are ignored
he flips a light switch on and off a few times as he says
the entire hall responds in unison
the room falls silent
every member of the jdl sits straight up with their hands folded in front of them
the time for action is now
we predict that the st
nick day massacre will put hanukkah christmas relations back at least a hundred years
with this meshuggena new santa claus in power hanukkah is in jeopardy
our first order of business is to put into motion a plan to create goodwill towards the jewish community
chairman of the worldwide jewish media conspiracy
harvey weinstein sits before a plaque reading harvey yes chief
we need your people to crank out a couple more award winning documentaries on the holocaust possibly a new adam sandler movie
the chairman of the anti defamation league pipes in
not another adam sandler movie
whats wrong with adam sandler movies
were trying to create goodwill here
i just think
frankly i dont care what you think
i think youre a putz
the plaque reading anti defamation league is clearly framed in this shot
beat dont defame me
im against that
our next order of business is to assign an agent to track santas activities
step in and use force if the situation calls for it
we need to put the toughest jew we have on the case
one of the jdl members calls out
what about steven spielberg
cmon he made et
we need someone tough people
a second member calls out
what about itzahk perlman
hes in a wheelchair for crying out loud
we stay on the chief while we hear offscreen
missing in action
hes a lawyer
were looking for heros people
whats he gonna do make santa disappear
think people think
we need a hard hittin hebe on this one
at the back of the room esther a semitic siren pushes her way to the front
a black skirt covers every inch of her sexy figure
what about mordechai jefferson carver
the hall fills with hushed voices as the various members of the jdl whisper to one another
the hebrew hammer
after the way he handled that situation in the west bank
hes the only jew in the world too extreme for the jdl
theres a reason why we kicked him out of our ranks sweetheart
we need a man who can follow orders
a man with self control
we need a man
the council elder a sage looking elderly jewish man interrupts
the plaque in front of him reads sage elderly we need a man who can get the job done
daddy hes our only hope
and you know it
the chief nods his head reluctantly
only problem is ever since we kicked him out he wants nothing to do with us
theres no way we can persuade him to come back
esther lifts her skirt a few inches
perhaps i can persuade him
a shoddy low rent office replete with film noirish lighting via the blinds
the hammer fiddles with a dreidel as he sits with his feet propped up on his desk
his shtreml hat is skewed to one side and a toothpick dangles from his lips
it was the day before hanukkah when she strolled into my office
there is knock at the door
the door opens to reveal a long denim skirt covering every possible inch of flesh
we tilt up the length of the skirt to reveal esther
she is breathtakingly sexy
the hammer quickly removes his feet from the table
esther approaches his desk and sits
please call me mordechai
from the way she carried herself i could tell shed been around the block a few times
sorry im late
traffic was a pisher and ive been circling the block for the past half hour looking for parking
what are you listening to
oh the things i would do to her if i had the
the hammer attempts to press stop on his tape recorder but accidentally fast forwards to another part of the tape
we hear the sound of sexual intercourse
the hammer scrambles for the stop button
beat what can i do for you
my name is esther
chief bloomenbergensteinenthal from the jewish defense league desperately needs to speak with you
how is old chief bloomenbergensteinenthal
is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on
annoyed actually his days of marital infidelity have long since past
now he just shtoops my mother exclusively
the hammer makes the realization
mordechai santa claus has been rubbed out by his son damian
the mans a demon
theres no telling what this new anti semitic psycho santa is capable of
im sorry to hear about santa
he was a good friend but my days
the hammer stops himself and glances over esthers shoulder
in the doorway stands a blonde bombshell in a mink coat
id like to hire you to put a tail on my husband
i think my life might be in danger
i think he wants to kill me
sorry shiksa i think you got the wrong office
im the hebrew hammer
mike hammers down the hall
the blonde bombshell is confused for a moment
esther you seem like a nice girl so im only gonna say this once
i no longer affiliate myself with that organization
the politics there were brutal
besides ive already got a full case load
esther looks down at his desk
we cut to a shot of the hammers in out box
both are completely empty and thickly coated with spiderwebs
the hammer takes notice of her expression of skepticism
thats all done electronically now
still a look of disbelief
why are you being so difficult
all my father wants is to just speak with
i hate to cut you short but in an hour the sun goes down and then its officially the sabbath
i cant work on the sabbath
this is where were going to have to part ways boobola
the hammer grabs his overcoat from the coat rack
esther gets up as well
im not leaving your side until i get you to agree to come speak with my father
its obvious the hammers amused by her persistence
be my guest
but i have to warn you im going to my mothers for dinner tonight
and if you think im difficult wait till you meet her
the two walk towards the front door of the office
solemnly before we leave theres just one more thing
i noticed that the sign on your door says youre a certified circumcised dick
would you mind if i asked to see your credentials
the hammer looks directly into the camera and shakes his head proudly
we start on the outside of the front door as we hear the ding of the doorbell
carver the epitome of jewish motherhood opens the door
for all the gentiles reading i thought i might digress for just a moment
jewish mother adj
a complicated and charismatic package of the following qualities rolled into human female form intense judgmental overbearing manipulative lacking boundaries yet fiercely involved loving and protective of her children
the hammer pulls a bottle of wine out from a paper bag
shabat shalom mama
i brought some manischewitz
the black label
i can see
and you also brought a nice girl to come eat by us
carver forcefully grabs esther into an embrace resembling a bear hug and begins to plaster her with sloppy kisses
esther is visibly overwhelmed by it all as the kissing and embracing continue for a bit too long
carver places her tongue into esthers ear canal as a sign of affection forcing esther to break the embrace
carver and esther look at one another strangely for an awkward few moments
do you have a name
she sighs ferclempt from the story of purim
to hammer well now that were all acquainted lets sit down and start the sabbath
the hammer and esther grasp their stomachs which protrude from underneath their slightly unbuttoned shirts
plates of half eaten food are everywhere
on the table on the dining room furniture behind them etc
oy vey im stuffed
i dont think i could eat another latke if you paid me
carver enters the dining room through the kitchen door carrying an enormous platter loaded with serving dish after serving dish of food
everybody ready for the main course
esther and the hammer exchange looks
mom i think weve had enough
carver places the food on a dresser opposite the kitchen table and then sits
hysterically nonsense young man
youll eat everything in front of you
after all there are people starving in china
isnt that right mun chi
we cut to a previously unseen end of the table
mun chi a skin and bones elderly chinese man looks up in response to his name
the plate directly in front of him is still pristine
he mutters something in chinese and then reaches for a chicken wing on a platter in the middle of the table
carver smacks his hands away with a wooden salad spoon and then glares at him
not until mordechai finishes everything in front of him
carver directs her piercing stare at the hammer
beat so esther how did you and mordechai meet
you know they call him the hebrew hammer for a reason
esther coughs up some of her food
the hammer interjects
esther works for the jdl
they sent her to try and recruit me back to save hanukkah for them
what she doesnt seem to understand is that nothing not even god himself could convince me to ever work for them again
but hanukkahs in dan
the hammer cuts her off
not my problem
if youll excuse me now i need to use the bathroom
he stands and leaves
carver stares lovingly at esther
you like my mordechai yes
hes very nice
desperately but mrs
carver the fate of hanukkah rests solely in his hands
please you have to help me
it isnt even one of the high holidays
what concerns me more is that my boychick is almost thirty and has yet to settle down with a nice jewish girl
beat ill make you a deal
ill help you with your little hanukkah problem if you help me with my mordechai
confused what do you want me to do
he works too much
god forbid he should have a nice jewish girl come eat by him once in a while
take his mind off his work
maybe a blowjob here and there
esther begins to choke again
is this something you could do for me
the hammer calls out from the bathroom
mom where do you keep the plunger
yells its under the sink by my tampons
esther appears panicked
so do we have a deal
in the bg we hear the toilet flush
the hammer begins his walk back to the table
the hammer sits down
so what did you two ladies discuss while i was gone
esther begins to speak but mrs
i was just telling your nice friend esther about how i used to have such a problem with the gas
to esther so once i started taking two charcoal pills before i ate the gas cleared itself right up
esther plays along
good to know
carver turns her attention towards her son
do you love your mother
mom stop with this already
of course i love you
youre my mother
then how come you wont stop this certified circumcised dick nonsense and get yourself a real job
mom i have a real job
i do good things for this community
i help people
when i play bridge with all the girls everyone has what to talk about with their sons
they show pictures
their sons are lawyers and doctors and rabbis
why cant i show a picture
angered so dont show a picture
you know my friend maureen
her son the investment banker
he paid for her entire retirement in boca raton
what a mench he is
instead of schleping to save hanukkah god forbid you should go back to business school and get an mba
maybe then you could send me to boca too
this puts the hammer into a neurotic fit
so all of a sudden my saving hanukkahs not good enough for you
is that what your saying
carver throws her arms up in resignation
i dont want to argue with you
lets just eat in peace
were gonna argue
and you know what mom
im going to save hanukkah just to spite you
and when my face is all over the television
when your friends are opening their hanukkah gifts next year dont mention it to them okay
i wouldnt want you to have to show my picture
do what you must
carver looks at esther and winks
to esther such a good boy he is
the hammer shakes his head in frustration
carver becomes very animated
mazel tov a tabby with two paralyzed back legs wearing a diaper slides itself across the floor
with each writhing motion we hear a very distinct swishing noise
carver picks the cat up and places it in her lap
mazel tov makes a strange unhappy noise
whats that mazel tov
your diaper needs changing
carver pulls off mazel tovs diaper while it still sits in her lap
she plays with undiapered cats two good paws
to mazel tov lets let your tuchus breathe
mom why dont you put that cat out of its misery
extremely offended because it isnt gods way
when you spent the fourth grade in bed recovering from your bout with hypoglycemia did i put you down
mazel tov will lead a full life just like the rest of us
isnt that right mazel tov
the cat purrs back at her
she takes the cat from her lap and places it on the floor
brown streaks cover her white blouse
anybody hungry for desert
jewish defense league sunday hrs year is typed out sequentially over the image of the building
the exterior resembles any walled private residence with a front gate
the hammer stands in front of the large metallic star of david vault like gate and pushes the button next to it
a computerized voice begins
jew confirmation test initiated
hes clearly irritated by this
youve gotta be kidding me
theyre still doing this
please state your full hebrew name
mordechai baruch netanyahoo
the vault like gate slides open in a futuristic manner and the hammer steps in
the gate shuts behind him and he finds himself in an all white room
a microphone is placed by another massive door directly in front of him
please state the six dishes found on the passover seder plate in alphabetical order
beitzah charoset chazeret karpas maror and zeroa
the second door slides open and morty steps forward into the next room
inside this room lies a single violin in a case
please demonstrate musical aptitude
the hammer picks up the violin and begins to play hava nagila
hes pretty damn good at it
the next door slides open and hammer steps forward into yet another room
a drape about four feet high off the floor is stretched into a semi circle against the wall of the room
please step forward and remove your undergarments
the hammer steps inside the drape and drops his pants
a panel on the wall opens and a metal probe heads for his shmekel
he is clearly uncomfortable with this bit of testing
the door slides open and the hammer quickly pulls his pants up as he steps into the next room
the room is completely empty with the exception of a one way mirror on the front wall by the door
final test initiated
the hammer waits a few seconds but quickly becomes agitated
can anybody hear me
i think this machine is broken or something
to himself this is ridiculous
i didnt even want to come here
i shlep all the way out to the middle of nowhere for lord knows what purpose and
we cut to the other side of the mirror
the chief observes the hammer as he continues to whine
next to them a meter with the label whining scale slowly grows in magnitude as the hammer continues to rant
the meter bars go from red to yellow in color
i am so unhappy with this situation
why do you always feel it necessary to do what other people want you to do
why cant you be your own man
the meter bars switch from yellow to green finally passing the jewish mark
to himself hes still got it
back inside with the hammer the doors slide open revealing the chief to the hammer
welcome back hammer
the hammer and the chief make their way down the hallway
since youve been gone hammer some things have changed around here
our agents are now subjected to a strict physical training regiment
take a look
the chief stops at a door labeled goldsmiths gym
the sign is illustrated with a picture of a hasidic jew squatting a dumbbell a la golds gym
the chief opens the door
inside about five or so hasids decked out in white karate gis stand facing the door
by the front door a group leader notices the hammer and walks towards the door
he bows with his hands folded in front of him as a sign of respect
the hammer returns the gesture
the group leader shakes his head in one last respect and then turns away from the hammer as he goes back to his class
on the back of his gi is written the word jew do
a minion practicing jew do the deadly fighting art
the two leave and continue their walk down the hallway
an agent with his back to camera fiddles with some high tech gadgetry that lines the walls
weve even relaxed our centuries old admissions criteria
the chief stops behind the man and taps him on the back
sammy davis jr
the spitting image of sammy turns to greet the two
mordechai jefferson carver id like for you to meet the jewish defense leagues first black jewish agent
a close personal friend of mine agent sammy davis jr

sammys all smiles

the hammer enters and the chief shuts the door behind him

the hammer heads for the door

the hammer walks out the door
the chief calls to him
the fate of hanukkah rests squarely on your shoulders
a beat passes and then the hammer walks back in
you guys have seriously got to stop with that stuff
thats a lot of pressure to put on one jew
im only human you know
im already shvitzing about the whole thing
you know believe it or not im allowed to make mistakes too
i can only do the best that i can do and thats just gonna have to be good enough for all of you
a reaction shot of the befuddled chief
just stop with that
alright im out of here
we see various shots of the hammers caddy
the grill the white wall tires the fuzzy dreidel hanging from the rear view mirror etc
we start on an incredibly impressive looking building
over this we see the words kwanzaa liberation front typed out sequentially
the camera than tilts down to reveal a popeyes chicken
a black teenager scouts the street with a pair of binoculars
binocular pov instead of the usual two circles we see the world through two cutouts of the african continent
the hammers caddy pulls up
the teen runs inside
the hammers caddy pulls up to a stop right at camera giving us a full view of the license plate
it reads lchaim
a handful of baaad brothers decked out in a mixture of african clothing and combat gear relax to the sounds of mellow blaxploitation music
posters and other pro kwanzaa propaganda hang on the walls of the room machine guns rest idly against sofas blunts are passed around
were talking black panthers here
a white accountant counts money at a card table to the side of the room
the black teenager enters breathlessly
hey yo we got ourselves a visitor
one of the baaad brothers inquires
who is it
its some pimped out hebrew dude in a caddy
the men scramble for their guns inserting clips and removing safeties
the front doors bust open and we dolly into the hammer
all guns are trained on him
from behind the frontline of gunmen mohammed clearly the leader of the operation pushes his way through
he walks towards the hammer
you can feel the tension in the room
the hebrew hammer
my main kike
mohammed ali paula abdul rahim
my main nigga
the two embrace in a warm hug
the white accountant looks up in shock from the card table
his nametag is clearly visible and it reads white accountant
he points at mohammed
you just called him a kike
he points to the hammer
you just called him a nigger
the hammer and mohammed look to one another
theyre having a hard time understanding his concern
well its okay when we call each other that
the white accountant thinks it over for a second
the other brothers put their guns down and go back to their pre hammer activities and the accountant takes his place back at the card table
mohammed puts his arm around the hammer
so morde chai tell me what brings your bad self down to the klf
im back on the job for the jdl
you hear about that crazy white boy who took over as santa
oh most definitely
got the brothers here in full alert mode
the hammer looks over at the brothers smoking weed making out with their girlfriends etc
mohammed takes notice
gotta always be cool under pressure
you know what im sayin
so whats the word on the street
word is that papas got a brand new bag and its velvety red and it aint gonna be overnight fed exed to jerusalem
if you know what i mean
this clearly flies over the hammers yarmulke
what does that mean
it means that santas gonna fuck hanukkahs shit up
not if i can help it
you got any information for me
but i know somebody who does
mohammed escorts the hammer through a love beaded doorway into a back room
inside jamal a black elf sits on a sofa
a blunt hangs from his mouth and his arms are wrapped around two gorgeous sisters
jamal id like for you to meet the hebrew hammer
jamal pulls his shades down slightly to get a better look
id like for you to tell him what you told me
aight aight cool
yo its like this
that nigga santy claus be trippin
first that motherfucker kills his own pops then he start talkin bout bustin a cap in hanukkahs ass
next the racist motherfucker kick my ass out the workshop sayin that there aint no room for no little colored elves like me
can you believe that shit
yo if it wasnt for the arthritis in my joints you best believe that id be
jamal makes the sideways gun holding gesture and mock pulls the trigger
bustin caps all up in his ass
you know what im sayin
is there anything else you can tell me
his hangouts his next move anything
jamal thinks for a second
well come to think of it there is one thing
before i left i was packin up my shit and i overheard the nigga talkin to some business pahtnah or something
sayin that hed meet him today at some joint called dukes
round five oclock if my memory serves
when he got off the phone and jetted i scoped the room for some jewelry cash whatevers
you know a severance package
didnt find any duckets but i did snatch this
jamal pulls out a matchbbok from his pocket
the front cover reads dukes where skin is in
he hands it to the hammer
thanks little brother youve been a big help
shit fool aint no thang
if it wasnt for my real brothers here at the k
id be shining shoes at the train station or getting my afro tossed up against a velcro wall in some redneck bar somewhere
i finally gots a place where i belong

mohammed and the hammer head towards the door
hes still got a long way to go before he understands the true meaning of kwanzaa
thanks again mo you always deliver the goods
you watch your back hammer
hanukkah might just be his first move
for all we know kwanzaa could be next
theres a lot of brothers counting on you
if you fail
im going to work really really hard on this one
but please stop with the pressure
im already tense as it is
aveenooh shalom alechem brother
mohammed pounds his fist against his chest and then raises it
the hammer returns the gesture
the hammers caddy drives past a sneaky looking salvation navy guy
we do your standard blaxploitation zoom into him as he begins to speak into the lapel of his uniform
santa holds a walkie talkie in hand and we the hear the voice of the salvation navy guy
although behind him hangs a banner reading santas workshop the interior is a run down sweatshop
hes on his way
everything is going as planned
santa puts the walkie talkie down and addresses somebody with the hebrew hammer out of the picture hanukkah will be nothing more than a confusing and hard to pronounce word
i want to thank you very much jamal for all of your help
we cut to the other side to reveal whom hes speaking to
jamal the same black elf from the kwanzaa liberation front sits at the table across from santa
shit nigga aint no thang
hey yo santy claus so does this mean that you gonna make me an official elf now
can you believe this guy tiny tim
santa looks over to tiny tim
unshaven not so tiny anymore and still on crutches tiny tims grown up since a christmas carol
a common street thug
cmon did you seriously think that scrooge would give free handouts to the cratchit family forever
tiny tim shrugs his shoulders
take a look around you jamal
do you see any colored midgets in my workshop
a shot of a couple of the same elves from the conference room slaving away on the assembly line
your presence would be a disruption to the utopian model of efficiency ive created here
thats some cold shit
the elves appear to be struggling with the speed at which the products move down the assembly line
the head elf steps out from the assembly line and addresses santa
utopian model of efficiency my ass
ever since you took charge this place has been more like a sweatshop
the other elves stop working and vocalize their agreement with the head elf
we know our rights santa
youre in violation of the union regulations
were going on strike
the other elves shout out their approval
santa takes it all in stride
you know something youre right
the head elf is taken aback by what seems to be a glimpse of compassion on santas part
this is a sweatshop
and since you elves arent willing to do the work i made arrangements to have some taiwanese children shipped over
and i might add theyre more than willing to work for peanuts
santa performs the two fingered whistle
come on in boys
a group of five taiwanese boys file past santa towards the assembly line
as each child passes santa he hands them each a bag of at the assembly line the taiwanese boys move like lightning as they gift wrap boxes clearly labeled nikey
kathy lee clothing company and starstrucks coffee
the elves including jamal watch in amazement at their agility and efficiency
defeated they shuffle out of the workshop
so whats our first plan of attack santa
while i was in taiwan negotiating the solution to our labor problems i came across a factory that illegally manufactures the most addictive jewish pride weakening substance on the planet
i bought the entire plant
santa walks over to a fed y truck overflowing with large brown cardboard boxes marked product
i want you and your men to target every young person in the jewish neighborhoods of every major city of this country
i want you to flood their streets with this product
what should i charge
oh thats the beauty of it
these are free samples
tiny tims curiosity is peaked
so whats in the boxes
santa slits open one of the boxes with a large knife and pulls out a videocassette generically labeled its a wonderful life
bootleg copies of the frank capra classic its a wonderful life
thats some cold shit
hard core punk music pours out from the inside of the bar
the hammer walks into frame and looks up at the sign
he curiously notes the astro turf spread across the pavement and then makes his way for the front door
we dolly into the hammer as he pushes open the western style doors
the music comes to a screeching stop
we hold on his cu as he looks around
we cut to the other side to get a look at what he sees a bar of about ten skinheads staring back at him dumbfounded
skinhead paraphernalia adorns the walls
the hammer maintains his cool takes a deep breath and then walks towards the bar
we cut to a floor level shot as his star of david spurs jangle as he continues his walk to the bar
he steps up to the counter where a skinhead bartender with a manson like swastika inked on his forehead studies him curiously
usually we dont serve your kind
but since you had the balls to walk in here kike ill pour you one last drink before we lynch you
the bartender reaches for a bottle of cherry flavored manischewitz wine
the hammer interrupts him by clearing his throat
actually can i have the black label
the bartender eyeballs him and then grabs the bottle of black label manischewitz
he grabs a glass from the rack and begins to pour
i figure if this is my last drink you might as well leave the bottle
the bartender stops pouring and places the bottle on the bar
be my guest
do you guys take shekels
i just got back from a trip in israel and all ive got is a fistful of shekels
he drops a fistful of shekels on the bar
a few skinheads slowly begin to approach the bar
the hammer picks up the bottle and begins to examine it
that was a good year for me
with one swift motion the hammer spins the bottle up to grab it by the neck and thwacks the bartender on the head with it
all of the other occupants in the bar jump out of their seats encircling the hammer
we do a quick push into the hammer as he pulls out two sawed off shotguns from underneath his coat
shabat shalom motherfuckers
he points his weapons and we
a wide shot of the bar
the camera is stationary
we hear the sound of shotguns blasting and then the sounds of intense fighting
a few seconds of the fighting sounds pass
suddenly the front doors bust open and a few bloodied skinheads fall out onto the ground followed by the hammer
hes untouched and he carries the bottle of manischewitz in one hand and a shotgun in the other
he stops in the midground and pours the manischewitz out on the astroturf lawn in a methodical manner
he approaches foreground and pulls out something from his jacket pocket
we see a cu of the same matchbook the elf gave him
dukes he lights a match and tosses it over his shoulder
we hear the sounds of bursting flames
the hammer puts his sunglasses on and walks straight past the camera
we pull back into a spinning overhead to reveal flames in the shape of the star of david burning on the lawn
curtis mayfields pusherman fades up and we cut into a still photo of tiny tim with his arms around two hasidic boys in an a alley
the screen divides into thirds as we see cus of each character smiling
stills are constantly replaced in time with the music
we see a still of money being exchanged then hands being shaken
then a still of a videocassette being placed into a vcr a hasidic kid watching the tv etc
the music continues as we
maccabee the same kid the hammer gave the hanukkah present to earlier in the film sits glued to his television set
from the television we hear someone approximating zuzu from the film its a wonderful life say
mommy says that every time you hear the sound of a bell ringing an angel gets his wings
a jewish mother calls to her son from o
its time to light the menorah
maccabee looks over his shoulder in disgust and then cranks up the volume on the film until all other sounds are drowned out
more stills depicting the sale and distribution of the videocassettes
a second addict jewish child is glued to his tv set
drool slowly makes its way down his chin
he gets up and we follow him into the living room where we find his parents
his father reads a newspaper while his mother is absorbed in her knitting
how come you made me jewish
his parents look to one another in absolute shock
an adolescent hasidic boy backs his way through the front door into the kitchen
hes carrying an incredibly large we cut to a shot of his family who watch this all go down as they sit at the kitchen table
the adolescent hasid finally gets the tree into the house and turns to see the rest of his family staring at him mouths agape
its a hanukkah bush
the family remains expressionless
the glass in his mothers hand slips from her grasp and shatters on the kitchen floor
the hammers caddy cruises slowly down the street
things definitely seem odd
the hammer looks out his left window
two hasidic children decorate a giant christmas tree on the street
he looks to his right
a group of hasidic kids sing christmas carols
the hammer looks through his front windshield
a kid is standing right in the middle of the road
the hammer slams on his breaks skidding to a stop just inches from the kid
its shlomo remember the kid the hammer helped with the yarmulke earlier
and he has a strange glazed look in his eyes
shlomo holds a videocassette in his hand
the hammer steps out of the caddy leaving his car door open
we hear the annoying beep beep beep door ajar sound
shlomo you okay
dreamily mommy says that every time you hear the sound of a bell ringing an angel gets his wings
the car door beeps again
the kid looks to it and the hammer follows his gaze
mommy says that every time you hear the sound of a bell ringing an angel gets his wings
the hammer is baffled
he looks down at shlomos hand and spots the videocassette
he grabs it from him and examines at it
bootleg its a wonderful life from taiwan
the hammer inspects the tape a little longer and then gives the label a huge lick
sixty five percent pure
people could get hurt watching this shit
to shlomo come with me
a pov shot from inside the hammers trunk as it opens
hammer stands with shlomo
inside the trunk we see a box of videos
the three on top read fiddler on the roof yentl and chaim potoks the chosen
the hammer grabs a copy of the chosen and hands it to shlomo
chaim potoks the chosen
get yourself home and watch this as soon as possible
a hasidic kid on a bike with a christmas tree in tow rides past the two
one of the ornaments makes a tinkling sound
mommy says that every time you hear the sound of a bell ringing an angel gets his wings
the hammer slaps him out of his spell
hey hey hey
you can beat this
now get going
the hammer dials a number on the payphone
as he dials he verbalizes the number hes calling
the hammer struggles with the last number but then quickly remembers
it rings once and then we hear the other line pick up
the chiefs on the other end
chief its me
i need for the worldwide jewish media conspiracy to mass produce video copies of every hollywood movie ever made featuring a positive jewish protagonist as its lead
you mean you want us to make copies of yentl fiddler on the roof and chaim potoks the chosen
get them out to the jewish community stat
we got an epidemic on our hands
were on it hammer
howd you do with santa
it was a trap
im back at square one
well then ive got good news for you
we just got word that hell be making an appearance at the mall of america today
im sending esther to meet you there at once
well disguise ourselves as a gentile couple to pass undetected
now that he thinks im dead this should be a piece of homentashen
one last thing hammer
you take care of yourself
we cut back to the hammer on the payphone
he holds the receiver away from his ear
he doesnt want to hear this
the fate of hanukkah
yeah got it
okay bye now
he hangs up and leaves
merry christmas decorations and signage dominate the landscape of the establishing shot of the mall
tiny tim walkie talkie in hand surveys this christmas wonderland with smug satisfaction
he spots a small barely visible hanukkah decoration poking out from beneath one of the other christmas decorations
he rips it from the wall and tosses it into a small trashcan bonfire
tiny tim speaks into his the walkie talkie
one partridge in a pear tree to two turtle doves
whats your status
two adult sized santas helpers tony and mikey stand with walkie talkies behind the nightclub velvet ropes and hold back the throngs extras of screaming children attempting to make their
way past the red curtain to see santa
a huge citizen kane big brother style poster with a menacing picture of santa looms behind them
it reads santa santas staging area is very studio
both tony and mikey are decked out in addidas warm up pants gold chains etc
tony very guido in his mannerisms replies into his walkie
nothing stirring here
a little blonde gentile girl tugs on tonys sleeve
can i be next
lets get a look at you shall we
the gentile girl pulls her power muff girls t shirt down allowing the two to get a better look at it
a power muff girls t
alright now spin around
she twirls for the two
go on and see santa sunshine
a pushy freckle faced gentile boy steps out of line and approaches the two
thats not fair
how come she gets to go next
we were here first
is that a fact
well guess what buddy
you aint gettin in to see santa today so why dont you just turn around and high tail it home
the kid begins to sob uncontrollably
but ive been waiting to see santa all year
tony apes him
but ive been waiting to see santa all year
the kid is a pathetic mess
you heard me
get moving punk
the hammer and esther scope out the area
the hammer is disguised terribly consisting of a baseball hat on top of his shtreml and a jesus fish t shirt worn over his black suit
esthers visibly nervous
any sign of santa
he must be behind that curtain
we need to give off the appearance of calm
you see esther the trick to undercover work is to try and blend in
act as a gentile would
the two pass a samples booth
the free samples woman solicits the hammer
could i interest you in a free sample bacon cheeseburger
we get a cu of the burger followed by a cu of the hammer
hes mortified but he pulls it together
while i thank you gentile friend for your generous offer of that deliciously unkosher snack i sadly have to decline for i stuffed myself full of meat and milk product
at a prior lunch engagement
the sample woman looks at him strangely as the hammer and esther walk on
the two take their place at the end of the line in to see santa
tony performs the two fingered whistle
can i have everyones attention please
in fifteen minutes santas gonna have to leave
the kids all vocalize their disappointment
ah dont be like that kids
we gotta lot work to do if were gonna get all those presents out in time
the kids arent buying it
more boos and protests of disapproval
you want shitty ass presents for christmas
you want barbies with heads screwed on backwards
you want remote control cars without the batteries included
then be my fucking guest
tony spits and grabs his crotch as he turns back around to take his place in front of the velvet ropes
esther surveys their place in line
its about fifteen deep
what are we going to do
were at least an hour from the front
cmon follow me
the two make their way up to the front of the line
they pass a man who looks eerily like ex rapping god mc hammer
to hammer is that
no couldnt be
not so fast
we have to get through
its an emergency
sorry pal youre gonna have to wait in line just like all the other parents
esther adjusts her bust
shes incredibly sexy in her tight fitting denim jacket
she smiles flirtatiously at the elves
were so sorry to have to cut but our beautiful gentile boy ran on ahead of us in line
she puts her hand on tonys bicep and smiles once again
it would mean so much to paul and i if youd let us through to see santa
tony is putty in her hands
umm when you put it that way
sure go on through
tony unhinges the rope and the two pass
the hammer leans over to esther
jimmy an adorable six year old sits on santas lap
santas assistants two busty blondes named bambi and tawni flank his chair
and what do the jewish people do during hanukkah
they worship the devil and sacrifice small gentile children like me in bizarre sadistic rituals
santa can tell that youve been a very good boy this year
run along now jimmy
bambi and tawni escort jimmy out and re enter with esther and the hammer
sorry folks i dont do couples
if you keep your mouth shut and come with me you wont get hurt
do i know you friend
take a look around you
do you even know who i am
the hammer rips off his baseball hat and t shirt
let me guess youre the goy who stole hanukkah
the hebrew hammer
the hammer takes out his gun and points it santa
whats your shpiel santa
whoa whoa there
cmon mordechai is this any way to treat an old family friend
lets cut out all the unpleasantness
i admit i went way overboard with the whole hanukkah thing
let me make it up to you
how about a peace offering
to bambi and tawni girls
santa snaps his fingers and bambi and tawni drape themselves on either side of the hammer rubbing his arms erotically
id like for you to meet world renown semitic super stud mordechai jefferson carver
bambi speaks with a thick southern drawl
oh i declare i just love jewish men
theyre so sensitive and well read
esther is clearly jealous
the hammers enjoying the attention
he looks down at bambis breasts
were talking huge obviously augmented boobolas
a large crucifix chain hangs around her neck nestled in between the mounds of silicone
we hear the requisite ding as it sparkles
the hammer is released from the sexual spell of the gentile seductress
i like my women like my matzah
the girls move away from the hammer
esther smiles at the hammers resolve
this is where you go down
suddenly tony draws the curtain back
hey hurry it up in there
we gotta bunch of kids
he sees the hammer with his gun pointed at santas head
esther pulls out her piece and points it at tony
back it up buddy
the entire crowd of children can now see whats happening
hushed fearful whispers
mc hammer steps out of line and pleads
please hammer dont hurt em
the hammer does a double take
mc hammer gives a did i just say that
lets do this clean
i dont want to make a scene santa
santa stands up slowly with his hands raised
well its a bit too late for that now isnt it
excuse me children if i could have your attention for a moment
what are you doing
im just calming the kiddies
to children theres no need to worry about santa
hes just having a peaceful adult conversation with his nice jewish friend the hebrew hammer
the hammer plays along raising his hand to keep the children calm
hows it hangin
in fact hes just informed me that he personally plans on cancelling christmas this year
the hammer and esther look to one another
this riles the masses
why dont we show him how that makes us feel
we hold a few beats on a shot of this fairly untrafficked portion of the mall
suddenly esther and the hammer haul ass around the corner running for their lives
a second or two pass and an angry mob of about twenty gentile children round the corner after them
theyre definitely not in the christmas spirit
the hammer and esther take another turn
from the other direction a second mob of children head straight at them
the hammer spots another corridor in front of them
they run about a hundred yards before they hit a wall
a dead end
we can hear the throng of children nearing in the whered they go
i saw them go down that hallway
cmon lets get em
hammer turns to esther defeated
the barely audible sound of a gospelized version of the biblical slave song let my people go sounds as if its coming from within the walls of the mall
do you hear that
the hammer tries to place the source
what is that
suddenly a panel on the wall slides open to reveal a door
the other side of the door is dark but it has a cavernous feel to it
an elderly jewish woman harriet tubbelman appears from out of the doorway
she smokes a corncob pipe
harriet escorts the two into the passageway and the door slides shut behind them
we appear to be in what looks like the loading dock for an its a small world after all type water ride
harriet leads esther and the hammer into one of the waiting cars
the cars kind of have a baby moses straw basket theme going on
the let my people go song piped from unseen speakers is now at full strength
you saved our lives
how can i ever repay you
my name is harriet tubbelman but you can call me moses
the only payment i ask mordechai is that you keep hanukkah safe for us all
she hands each of them a ticket and then lowers the lap restraints for hammer and esther testing them to make sure theyre secure
you should be safe from here on out
just follow the river to its conclusion
she begins to walk away but then catches herself as she turns back to face them
oh yeah and keep your arms and legs inside the water craft at all times
where are we
what is this place
she smiles with great pride
welcome to the underground jewish railroad
just sit back relax and enjoy the ride
the brakes on the water craft release and the craft makes it way from the loading dock
wide eyed esther and hammer check out their surroundings
hasidic animatronic puppets sing of thousands of years of jewish oppression and persecution in an educational yet oddly entertaining way
the hammer puts his arm around esther and continues to check out the attraction in wonderment
esther secretly glances at him affectionately
its clear shes falling for him
we cut to a wide shot as we watch the craft disappear down the river
a funkdafied version of the let my people go song fades up and over the gospel version from the ride
we see a non descript door in the middle of a brick wall
two turnstiles stand directly in front of the door
we can hear the muffled sounds of the gospel version of let my people go
scribbled on the wall is the graffiti phrase hanukkah the door opens and the obnoxiously loud music spills out into the street
the hammer and esther exit close the door and push their way past the turnstiles into the alley
that got annoying fairly quickly
yeah no kidding
a carnival worker stands behind a makeshift underground jewish railroad booth
the two hand the carnival worker their tickets
thanks for riding the underground jewish railroad
if you plan on returning today please make sure to get you hands stamped before you leave the alley
nah were kosher
the two walk past him
esther turns to the hammer
so now what
now we wait for santa to make his next move
he gives her a once over
she is stunning
want to get a drink
your typical blaxploitation bar
it could easily pass for the lenox lounge in harlem with the exception of the large menorah shaped sign out front
we see a bar packed with orthodox jews
a wall separating the men and women in the bar runs along the center of the room stopping about ten feet from the stage
signs clearly demarcate these men and women sections
onstage a klezmer band plays a rendition of a to be determined s funk classic
esther and the hammer enter the joint
mid song the bandleader notices the two walk in
the hebrew hammer everybody
the hammer raises his hand in acknowledgment
the entire bar cheers and applauds
hammer escorts esther to a table on the womans side of the wall and then walks around to the other side of the divider where he takes a seat opposite
the wall from her
the band begins a rousing version of hava nagila
a good majority of the men in the bar rush to the dance floor and begin dancing zealously with one another
esther shouts over the wall in an attempt to overcome the din of the bar
so do you come here often
the hammer struggles to hear
he shouts back to her
what was that
i said do you come here often
yeah about once a week
i said yeah about once a week
a hasidic bar patron approaches the hammer and smiles
would you like to dance
we get another shot of the men dancing together arm in arm on the dance floor
im okay right now
as the patron leaves joshua another hasidic man standing directly behind him takes his place at the hammers table
hey morty wanna cut a rug
nah im good
im kind of here with somebody
the hammer motions to the wall
joshua looks as if his feelings are hurt
maybe next time
maybe next time joshua
take it easy
as joshua leaves we get a wider shot of the hammers table
a long line of men leads up to it
chaim feygele an effeminate slick hasidic man chest hair spilling out of his loosely buttoned butterfly collar shirt neck dripping with gold chains steps up to the hammer
hes got a huge phoney smile plastered across his face
well shalom there mister
do we know each other
no but we have mutual friends
chaim points to the dance floor
another shot of men dancing with one another arm in arm
the names feygele
this guy is clearly making the hammer nervous
my friends call me morty
so morty i just love a man in a black suit
care to dance
mordechai is flustered
you know i
have to go to the bathroom
ill be right back
the hammer gets up quickly and leaves
we cut to esthers side of the wall
the hammer walks behind her while she checks out the band on stage
she turns around pleasantly surprised
do you want to get out of here
she looks relieved
i would love to get out of here
a smooth laid back blaxploitation era song pumps from the speakers
we do a slow pan from the stereo into a tight shot of esther and the hammer slow dancing
esther grunts and moans a bit
we begin a slow zoom back from the two eventually pulling back far enough to see what esthers moaning about
the hammer is a seriously terrible dancer stepping on her toes forcing her into awkward positions etc
we see a cu of the hammer accidentally stepping on her toes yet again
esther pulls herself away from the hammer
im better with men
sensually maybe we should try a different kind of dancing
you mean like disco dancing or doing the funky chicke
i get it
we see a tight medium shot of esther
her erect nipples are clearly outlined through her blouse
now the hammers really getting it
now were talking boobola
i want you to talk dirty to me
he thinks for a moment
i want to have lots of children by you
get a good paying stable job
settle down in long island somewhere
but not fancy schmancy
shes warming up
i want for our children to go to private schools and take music lessons
little abraham will go to stanford for college batya will go ivy league maybe vassar
afterwards theyll make the decision as to whether or not theyd like to continue their religious studies in israel
because hey after all well have practiced the highly effective assertive democratic style of child rearing sprinkled with a healthy dose of liberalism
shes on fire for him
oh god yes
also on a daily basis i want you to tell me what to do where to do it and how i should live my life
kiss me you semitic stud
she grabs him and kisses him passionately
i feel something poking around down there
maybe i should investigate
what do you think about that mr
certified circumcised dick
she begins to unzip his pants
we cut to a shot of an excited mordechai as we hear the sound of the unzipping of his pants reach its conclusion
a cu on her as she looks down at his jewish manhood
a wide eyed almost shocked reaction
she slowly looks back to him and smiles slyly
as the two embrace we rack focus from the two of them in the bg to the hanukkah candles burning brightly on the menorah in the fg
we blur out of focus
the sun rises over the city
we start close on the hammers hand as he screws a light bulb into his electric menorah until it glows orange
esther caresses the hammers chest as the two enjoy a post coital cigarette
wow that was amazing
the hammer gives her ass a smack and then picks up a container filled with some kind of white powder
he snorts a bit of it off of the star of david chain that hangs from his neck and places the container of white powder back in its place by
esther is mortified
what did you just snort
its for my allergies
the capsules make me gassy
you know ive been thinking about what santas got planned for us next
she cuts him off
your mother was right
you do work too hard
oh she said that did she
what else did mommy dearest have to say
well she also said that you need to find a nice girl to help take your mind off of your work
im just glad she thought i was good enough for you
the hammer sits up
when did you guys have this conversation
when i was in the bathroom
what else did she have to say
relax morty i think your mom is wonderful
she cares so much about you
get this while you were gone she said shed help me get you to work with the jdl if id come eat by you once in awhile
like i needed any incentive to be with you
the hammer goes into a fit
you made a deal with my mother to sleep with me if id help you
what does that make you
what does that make me
and my mother
what does that make her
he makes a realization
oh my god
shes become my pimp
and shes whoring her bitch son out to the highest bidder
its not like that
youre being completely neurotic
i was just playing along
he thinks aloud
always meddling in my life
this is so typical of her
to esther but from you
i thought we had something good here
im sorry esther i just dont think we can see each other romantically anymore
the phone rings and the hammer picks it up
we wipe into split screen
the chief is on the other end
hammer its the chief
weve got ourselves a situation
get yourself down here ive got something you need to see
the star of david vault like doors open and the hammer and esther hurriedly enter the room
the chief waits for them
thank god youre here
about an hour ago we received this transmission from the north pole
he clicks a button on a remote control and static fills the giant telecommunications screen eventually fading into the image of a larger then life santa
and now my hanukkah loving friends i will reveal to you the true nature of my diabolical scheme
an image of a giant clock in the shape of a star of david
the jewish atomic clock located in the outskirts of jerusalem
keeper of time for the jewish calendar
powered by judeum
an element so rare it exists only inside the clock itself
we tilt down to reveal a blue glowing substance in its base
santa comes back on screen
once i extract the judeum from the clock the jewish calendar will cease to exist forever eradicating hanukkah
in less than twenty four hours which by your jewish calendar is approximately
he struggles with this one
he looks at someone o
at the north pole
to someone at north pole can i borrow that pen and notepad
a notepad and pen are handed to him from o
santa makes some written calculations on the notepad
hes clearly having trouble
the hammer and esther exchange looks
uncertain four years and three quarters a lunar cycle
shifting back into psycho mode well whatever
in less than twenty four christian hours hanukkah will be nothing more than a fond memory
tiny tim hobbles into frame on his crutches
merry christmas everybody and god bless us everyone
the two laugh hysterically
the transmission however doesnt end
the two abruptly stop laughing
santa begins to talk to tiny tim
so how was i
it was good
very chilling but you still got all the points across that we talked about
we cut to more confused reactions of the hammer and esther
i wasnt too over the top
no it was the perfect level
oh did i tell you
i picked up that new kc and the sunshine band record that you recommended
you were right it is good
santa looks towards the camera and begins to react strangely
cameraman why is the red light on the camera still on
are you still filming me
santa approaches the camera
you fucking ass
static fills the screen
the hammer turns to the chief
looks like i got a plane to catch
take esther with you youll need the backup
no way its too dangerous
besides my days of hooking are over
youre not my bitch mordechai
please you have to believe me
did i miss something here
its a long story
ill explain when i get back from saving the clock
he turns his attention to esther
the hammer exits
esther is dejected
hes gonna need the help
a stock footage shot of an airplane landing
superimposed over the image are the words ben gurion airport israel
welcome to the ben gurion airport
for ground transportation please proceed to terminal
we cut to the hammer whos watching this stock footage of the airplane landing on a television set by the chertz car rental counter
the hammer approaches the counter where a female israeli rental agent stands waiting
do you speak english
the ch sound she makes is accompanied by a whole lot of spittle
the hammer wipes his face and then returns the favor
the hammer continues
i need to rent your biggest cadillac
preferably lowered with white wall tires
she checks her rental sheet
im so sorry sir but somebody just rented our last chadillac
she nails him again
seriously annoyed he wipes his face clean once more
well what else do you have
well we do have a ch
the hammer puts his hand up as a shield and cuts her off quickly
whatever it is ill take it
s road music occupies the soundtrack as we see a shot of the fast moving pavement of the open road
slowly we pull back to reveal the hammer throttling a monstrous harley the hammers talis flaps wildly in the wind
his shtreml helmet is strapped on tight over his goggles
the scenery oddly enough resembles the mojave desert
we cut to a sign reading the west bank palms a gated community
on it we see an illustration of a housing compound surrounded by a remarkable amount of barbed we pan over to the highway as the hammer zips past on his
the hammer unaware of her presence speeds by her large cadillac
she puts the car into gear
tucked out of sight behind a billboard esther pulls off from her side of the road and onto the highway in pursuit of the hammer
and yes the car is lowered with white walled tires
the camera makes it way up to reveal a large roadside billboard arrow resembling the ones you might see advertising casinos on the drive into vegas announces the jewish atomic
from the outside the j
c has the appearance of an observatory
for no apparent reason a small motorcycle ramp sits near the front door
a single fed y truck pulls into the dirt parking lot
a gang of thug elves spill out of the back of the truck as a s
go go go
the head elf jumps out and out of frame
an elf flunky stand by a small motorcycle ramp studying it curiously
the head elf walks into frame
whats this doing here
i think it was left over from an israeli robbie kneivel television special
you want me to get rid of it
besides its not like someones gonna jump their motorcycle into the building while were inside
the head thug elf points up towards the sky
theres santa now
the thug elves look up to the sky and we do an overhead push down on them as helicopter force winds blow their hats off
the carriage of santas sleigh touches down on the ground
tiny tim sits shotgun in the sleigh while santa vomits violently over the other side
santa finishes up and wipes his mouth with his hand
im airsick you asshole
where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly
i dont know
why dont you ask them sir
santa takes this in
santa paces as a drill sargent would in front of the line of harnessed reindeer
theyre shivering in their hooves
whos the leader of this operation
more scared reindeer faces
comet furtively motions towards rudolph with his antlers
santa sees this marches quickly up to rudolph and gets in his face
whats your major malfunction dumbfuck
rudolphs scared shitless
step forward son
rudolph attempts to move forward but the harness attachments prevent him from doing so
uh he cant sir
you can feel the robert deniro esque intensity boiling inside of santa
you gonna learn to guide this sled right
you gonna make sure your men follow suit
because if im puking down chimneys come christmas eve im gonna have your hide
rudolph shakes his head
the bells on his harness tinkle
santa continues to stare down the reindeer as he walks away
rudolph is clearly broken but continues staring back at santa as he makes his way out of frame
the expression on rudolphs face changes from fear to insolence as he angrily follows the o
suddenly santa charges right back into frame and places his drawn gun to rudolphs temple
you eyeballin me son
rudolph quickly looks away
santa puts his gun back into his belt and then adjusts his suit and hat as if to regain his composure
without warning santa throws a fake punch at rudolphs face forcing the reindeer to flinch
i didnt think so
santa and his gang bust through the front doors taking the two guards by surprise
santas men quickly tie them up and duct tape their mouths shut as if out of gullivers travels
the guards are dragged away out of frame
santa steps towards camera and surveys the room
the jewish atomic clock
its the kind of place where a giant telescope at an observatory would be housed
the clock is breathtaking in its size
on its face in place of the standard numerals are the names of jewish holidays
for example yom kipur is where the twelve should be followed by passover etc
in the center of the face an odometer like gauge reveals the year
at its base the brilliant blue judeum glows brightly
santa barks out orders
weve got work to do
one of the thugs pushes play on a ghetto blaster and the song santa claus is coming to town begins to play
a few of the thugs insert a bicycle pump into the judeum clock base and begin pumping
the hammer is moments away from the j
he spots the motorcycle ramp and then guns his engine
inside santa and his thugs hear the sound of the chopper growing in strength
the roar of the engines is piercingly loud
and then nothing
a beat passes and then the hammers motorcycle busts open the front door
an insert of the hammers bike skidding to a stop
as santa goes for his gun the hammer interrupts him
can you just give me one second
santa is confused
still on the bike the hammer uses his feet to backpeddle the motorcycle to the doorway
looks of bewilderment from santa and his gang
the hammer reaches the doorway and kisses his hand
a john wooish slo mo shot as the hammer touches his hand to the mezuzah nailed to the doorframe
the hammer jumps off the bike and we get the requisite quick push in on him as he pulls out two uzis from under his jacket
lets dance the hora
santa draws a pistol and with a single shot from his uzi the hammer blows it out of his hand
it lands on the other side of the room
santa looks up from his empty hand
get him boys
santas elf thugs open a chest filled with large sub machine guns
the chest is labeled heavy artillery
with great difficulty they struggle to pull the heavy machinery out of the box
the hammer mildly amused watches them
the hammer blasts away and the elves scramble for safety
the sound of gunfire is deafening and constant
an elf sneaks quietly towards santas gun
esther walks in through the front door and spots something o
that gives her cause for concern
unbeknownst to the hammer the sneaky elf picks up santas gun
he raises it at the hammer ready to fire
the hammer turns and nails the elf just in time
esther gun drawn backs up into frame with the hammer and the two fire off rounds
what are you doing here
mordechai i love you
i couldnt let you do this alone
i love you too
im sorry about freaking out yesterday
i was wrong
i forgive you
go check on the clock
ill finish up here
we do another quick push into the hammer as he turns towards tiny tim
tiny tim standing alone with his crutches tucked under his arms looks like a deer caught in headlights
the hammer grins mischievously
the hammer begins firing
in slow motion tiny tim hobbles as fast as he can towards an overturned table gunfire trailing him
like a pole vaulter with two poles tiny tim plants his crutches firmly into the ground and launches himself over the table
he lands directly on top of santa who cowers underneath the table
get off of me you cripple
what are we gonna do
hes got us on the ropes
we dolly back with the hammer as he approaches the camera firing rounds at the table
we cut to the duct taped hasidic guards tied to their chairs
one of them frantically nudges the other and motions to the window
fear fills both of their eyes
we see what they see
through the window the sun is quickly setting behind the mountains
we cut back to the hammer
the speed with which he shoots begins to slow
esther checking the clock for damage calls to him
whats the matter
i dont know
im feeling kind of tired
we cut back to santa and tiny tim underneath the table
we hear the shooting continue to slow until finally it ceases altogether
santa and tiny tim exchange looks
whats going on
whyd he stop
maybe he ran out of ammo
take a look
tiny tim pokes his head over the table to see
the hammer and esther lie together slumped up against the wall
they look exhausted
tiny tim drops back below the table
well hes kinda just resting in the corner with his girlfriend
he thinks for a second
an idea forms
what day is it
what time is it
i dont know
about sundown i guess
santa makes the connection
why didnt i think of this
its the sabbath
a blank look from tiny tim
the day of rest
he cant fight on the sabbath
cmon get up
weve got him beat
the hammers pov as santa and his thugs approach him cautiously
well well well
it looks as if the hebrew hammers got a weakness after all
santa turns to his thugs
finish extracting the judeum from the clock
to tiny tim tiny tim i want you to introduce the hebrew hammer to the christmas spirit
another blank look from tiny tim
you want me to be nice to him for no apparent reason whatsoever buy him clothing hell never wear and for just one day of the year pretend to forgive
him for all the horrible things he did to me as a young boy when my mommy wasnt looking
no dipshit i want you to kill him
he thinks about it
santas gonna take the sled back to the north pole and celebrate his victory with his new stocking stuffer
santa grabs esther and attempts to pull her up
the hammer holds on tightly to her other hand but isnt strong enough to resist santas might
esthers hand is pulled from his firm grip and santa takes her into his arms
santa forces her out the front door leaving tiny tim alone with the hammer
we hear the sound of santas sled taking off
take a look hammer
the clocks already beginning to power down
we see a shot of the elves pumping out the judeum from the clock and then tilt up to reveal its face
the dial slowly spins past yom kippur passover hanukkah purim and then finally the macys off spring sale
tiny tim raises his gun point blank at the hammer
whats the matter
no more snappy one liners
it seems all is lost when
we hear the sounds of a whole lot of guns being cocked
tiny tim turns around to see the entire kwanzaa liberation front with their guns raised at him
jamal standing next to mohammed flashes tiny tim a smile
merry kwanzaa nigga
the hammer and mohammed enter through the vault doors
the chief waits anxiously
mordechai youre back
thanks to the help from the brothers at the klf hanukkahs safe for now
the chief notices the hammers dejected look
so why the long face
santas got her
the chief overcome by sadness slumps down into a chair
will you help me
i love her sir
if i dont help you i wont be able to make her my wife
mohammed ali paula abdul rahim has agreed to come with me to the north pole on a rescue mission
mo standing in the bg gives the chief the fist chest salute
to mo youre a mench
to hammer mordechai by any means necessary you bring my esther back to me
even if it requires using judaisms most powerful weapon
oh no not the
the chief shakes his head yes
there wont be any need for that sir
hammer the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands
i know sir
i wont let you down
the hammer motions to mo and the two begin to leave
they pass by sammy davis jr
the hammer acknowledges him
sammy davis jr
you two cats are beautiful
i love you guys
you take care babe
mo whispers into the hammers ear
whats wrong with him
hes still working out some identity issues
the hammer and mo crawl onto the snow covered bluff overlooking santas workshop
with his binoculars the hammer scopes out the compound below
binocular pov instead of your standard two circles filling the screen we see the world through a pair of star of davids
the place resembles the exterior of an industrial warehouse with two elves on guard with guns
its gonna be tough but the back entrance looks like our best bet
i wanted to ask you how were you able to pinpoint the exact location of santas workshop
weve been trying to gain that piece of surveillance for years
the hammer puts the binoculars down
this is the year
its time the boys at the klf got into the th century
let me show you something
the hammer pulls out a laptop computer
the jdl supplies all its agents with this state of the art device called a laptop computator
whats it do
now this might get a bit technical but try and stay with me
using a highly sophisticated connection of other computators called the internet i can access surveillance maps villian biographical information and even sports scores with a few simple keystrokes of this
the hammer makes a few keystrokes and turns the screen towards mo
man thats far out
hey the jets won
but wait theres more
with a few swift clicks of this hand computer interface commonly referred to as a mouse i can download illicit pornographic material and even send it along to a friend
via a cyber postal route known as e mail
mos interest is seriously peaked
youre tellin me that you can get porno on that thing
take a look
the hammer does some computing
for example heres a picture of your sister tawanda getting freaky with a german shepard
mos eyes widen
gettin freaky with a what
he grabs the laptop from the hammer and looks at the screen
a picture of tawanda making out with a german man decked out in lederhosen on a rural german hillside
the two are surrounded by sheep
mo gives a sigh of relief
oy vey thats almost as bad
thats tawanda getting freaky with a notorious white supremacist
mo goes for the keyboard
wheres the white out button on this thing
we get a cu of the enter key as mo presses it
a soothing computerized female voice purrs
what just happened
remember that bit about the cyber postal route
the hammer looks at the blissfully ignorant mo with empathy
nah forget about it
santa sits at the head of his conference table
tawni and bambi sit on his lap
a cigarette dangles from his mouth and he holds a giant glass of eggnog in his hand
rudolph stands in the corner of the room
rudolph more egg nog
rudolph equipped with a tray around his neck holding a glass of egg nog walks over
santa stares at him antagonistically as he takes the glass off of the tray and takes a sip
santa puts his cigarette back into his mouth takes a drag and blows smoke past camera
a huge cloud of smoke blows over rudolphs face
santa smiles at his women as we hear rudolph cough
ho ho ho
suddenly the two women are pushed from his lap as a sassy black prostitute rises up between his legs from underneath the table
listen motherfucker i already told you
i dont care how much yo ass is payin me if you call me that one more time there aint gonna be no more visits down to the south pole
you feelin me
his ego deflates a bit
yes maam loud and clear
tiny tim enters the room
he has a black eye and his clothing is torn
damn sugar what happened to you
santa i got some really bad news
the hammer wears tefilon consisting of leather straps with boxes wrapped around his head and arms
he silently bows his head in front of the gigantic wall as he mumbles something to himself
mo nervously scans the area for guards
what are you doing
just praying to god that we dont kill ourselves going over this wall
the hammer unwraps his leather straps and then tosses them high over the wall
the boxes on the straps catch on a pipe
the line is pulled taut and the boxes hold secure against the pipe
the hammer and mo begin to scale the wall a la the s batman and robin television show
the hammer leads the way while mo directly behind him has his arms wrapped tightly around his waist
the hammer stops climbing for a second and turns to him
you know you dont have to hold on to my waist
youre tied in
mo releases his arms from the hammers waist
indeed he is tied in
i knew that
the hammer and mo drop from the wall onto the ground
the hammer looks around
no guards in sight
in front of them is door clearly marked well that was easy
mo heads for the door
the hammer calls to him
before we enter you need to know that my research has determined that santas compound is wired with the xp stereo type alarm system
a stereo type alarm system
take a look
the hammer points to above the door
sure enough there sit how do we bypass it
the alarm will trigger if the system detects any non w
tendencies inside the building
for example if you were to dribble a basketball or eat watermelon or use the word dawg
that is spelled with an aw as opposed to the letter o
within the confines of this workshop the alarm would sound
this pisses mo off
listen cat ill have you know that i hate the taste of watermelon and am a terrible basketball player
well thats good news for us
it means the system is outdated
this should be easy
the two enter through the door
the hammer shuts the door behind them
so far so good
suddenly the two hear the sound of footsteps coming down the hall
they duck into a corner
the sound of the footsteps passes
the hammer makes the silent military eyes gesture to mo by pointing two fingers at his eyes indicating for him to check and see if the coast is clear
mo bends out from the corner to look
pennies fall from his pockets
its all clear
the hammer bends down to pick up the change
mo i think you dropped some
mos eyes widen in terror
the hammer picks up the pennies and the ear splitting alarm system is triggered
red lights flash and over the loudspeakers we hear
mo and the hammer start running down the hallway
doors line the corridor
the hammer kicks open one of the doors and enters as it shuts behind him
the camera stays in the hallway with mo who looks around nervously
from inside the room we can hear the hammer exits the room
the two continue on down the hall
the hammer spots another door violently kicks it open and enters
again the door shuts behind him followed by the sound of more intense the hammer exits
cmon lets go
mo stops and looks at him
what are you doing
that jewish atomic clock stuff ate up a lot of our budget
mo shakes his head in understanding and the two run on making a hard right out of frame at the corridors end
a beat passes and then we hear more intense gunfighting
mo and the hammer run into frame
mo points to the other end of the hall
theres tiny tim
tiny tim spots them and begins to hobble furiously away in the other direction
ill take tiny tim
you go find your woman
mo runs down the hallway after tiny tim
the hammer turns towards the other direction to find
two elves on multi colored mopeds comin right for him
the hammer stands motionless as the elves gain ground
right before they reach him the hammer quickly pulls his talis off of his neck and holds it outstretched clotheslining the two off of their mopeds
the elves are out cold
the hammer admires his work
santa running for his life rounds the corner
he stops dead in his tracks as he spots the hammer
the two look at one another for a brief moment and then santa points at something behind the hammer
hey whats that over there
is that a bowl of matzah ball soup
the hammer looks behind him
he turns back to find santa long gone
he takes off down the hall after santa
mo catches up to the hobbling tiny tim and begins to mock the manner and speed at which he runs running side by side with him circling around him as
he attempts to get away etc
realizing that itd be impossible to outrun him tiny tim comes to a stop
mo trains his pistol on him
now im gonna do to you what i should have done earlier
tiny tim closes his eyes in anticipation of the worst
mo grabs both of his crutches from under his arm and runs off
tiny tim wobbles a few steps and then slumps down against the wall
we pull away from tiny tim as he calls to mo
not my crutches
santa enters the room and begins to frantically barricade the front door with anything he can find a chair a large crucifix a cart of tomatoes
feeling confident that the door is secure he turns around to find the hammer standing in front of him
the hammer grabs santa by his shirt
wheres my girlfriend santa
i dont have to tell you anything hammer
youre gonna have to kill me before i tell you
the hammers confused
but if i kill you then youll be dead
santa thinks about this for a couple seconds
the hammer looks up from his interrogation and spots a sign taped to a door directly behind santa
it reads the room the hammer grins mischievously at santa
dont worry your pretty little head
hammer fires a single round past camera
red splatters his face
we cut to the other side
santa cowers by the cart of that was a warning shot
we hear esther screaming from inside the room
im in here
the hammer turns towards the sound
suddenly santa kicks the hammers gun out of his hand and then draws a pistol from behind his belt and points it at him
looks like the tables have turned once again hammer
more screaming from esther behind the door
and you wont even be able to say goodbye to your esther
so long mordechai
give my father my regards
santa readies to fire
i didnt want it to come to this but you leave me no choice
i have no other option but to use the most powerful weapon in the jewish arsenal
the hammer closes his eyes and puts his hands together as if in meditation
santa looks around nervously
what are you doing
the hammer meditates for a bit more
suddenly his eyes open and he begins
i shlepped all the way to the north pole for this
i come to fight you and you dont even put out anything to nosh on
what kind of arch nemesis are you
well it wont work on me hammer
im too strong for it
esther continues to scream for help
this makes the hammer even more determined
what sort of host would treat company this way
esther is clearly uncomfortable in your guest room
im shvitizing from running around shooting people
and my feet
what kind of flooring is this anyway
my arches are killing me
its beginning to work on santa
and to top it off you didnt even have the courtesy to give me a proper hello when i entered the room
what have i ever done to you to be treated with such disrespect
santas a wreck
please make it stop
ill do anything
here take my gun
he hands his piece to the hammer and kneels on the ground pointing to his head
please just one to the head
put me out of misery
mo enters the room
hammer you alright
watch him for me
the hammer kicks open the door
she is restrained to a chair
the hammer quickly unties her and the two kiss
as they continue kissing we hear the sound of someone clearing their throat
the hammer looks towards the source of the noise to see none other than joseph lieberman
joe is tied to a chair and wears a gore lieberman campaign button
the hammer begins to untie joe
thank god youre here
esther looks at the hammer curiously
you two know each other
we go to the same temple
all three step back into santas conference room
mo continues to hold santa at gunpoint
mo get him out of my sight
mo begins to take santa away
the hammer turns around
i need closure here
to santa i just wanna say one thing
you know where you messed up santa
you underestimated the true meaning of hanukkah
santas a broken man
he gets on his knees and inquires earnestly
please tell me
what is the true meaning of hanukkah
the hammer thinks about this for a second
hes drawing a blank
he looks to esther and she shrugs back at him
thats a very good question
and i do know that it does have something to do with
esther chimes in
and some miracle oil that lasted eight days
and that my friend shouldve been enough for you
take him away mo
mo drags santa out of the room
i see the light now
i was wrong
and santas gone
the hammer turns to esther and gets down on one knee
he places a ring on her finger
esther bloomenbergensteinenthal will you marry me
id gladly give up my last name to be with you
the two kiss in celebration
joe pokes his head out into the hallway
what happened out there
he looks to the hammer
the hammer shrugs his shoulders
oh mordechai you know how i detest gore
well then maybe you should have thought about that before you ran with him
cmon lets get you back to washington
and we pull out as the three make their way down the hallway
carver exits the kitchen platters of food in hand
shabat shalom everybody
we see esther and the hammer at the other end of the table
they smile and hold hands
with a bit of difficulty mrs
carver works her large behind into her chair
and a merry christmas to all of our gentile friends
the hammer raises his glass in honor of mun chi
mun chi returns the gesture
before we start the sabbath id personally just like to thank god for all the blessings ive received over the past year
a beautiful fiancee
a wonderful mother
carver is as proud as can be
and the opportunity to help my brothers and sisters in the jewish community
well im just glad youre safe bubba shaina and eating by your mother for shabos
she squeezes his hand
carver begins to cut her meat
but with all the attention the newspapers and television have given you youd think that you were the pope or something
proudly well i did save hanukkah mom
my children and my childrens children and my childrens childrens children
he gets himself back on track
and their children will all be able to eat latkes and spin dreidels and light the menorah with the knowl
interrupting so you saved hanukkah mr
i mean lets be honest mordechai it isnt even one of the high holidays
mordechai looks to esther
she shrugs her shoulders in encouragement
now if you had saved passover or yom kipur then maybe youd have what to brag about
did i tell you that my friend maureens son the investment banker was responsible for a very big merger on
no no no no no
i see what youre doing here
so all of a sudden hanukkahs not good enough for you is that right
we get a shot of mrs
shes a master of the art of pleasant non listening
well i have news for you mom
it is good enough
im good enough and i wont leave here until i hear you tell me
carver picks up the paralyzed tabby and begins eskimo kissing it
hello mazel tov
a boojee boojee boojee boo
im not finished yet mom
mun chi completely uninvolved in the conversation and obviously famished scoops serving after serving onto his plate
carver ignores her son as she continues to play with the cat
a boojee boojee boojee boo
whats that mazel tov
your tuchus needs some more airing out
carver removes the diaper
esther and hammer gag from the smell of it
mun chi a forkful of food inches from his mouth gets a whiff and then places the utensil down in angry frustration
what a good poop you made in your diaper mazel tov
mommy loves you
such a good boy you are
this gets the hammer going
oh i get it
to you the cat pooping in his diaper is somehow better than my saving a jewish holiday
giving up forget it
so what are you two planning after the wedding
well for starters were going to honeymoon in boca for a week
and then when we get back mortys been talking about taking a stable good paying job as a consultant for the jdl
well i couldnt be happier for the both of you
from outside we hear the sound of sleighbells ringing
i think i hear the new santa claus busy at work
the hammer motions for everyone to get up and follow him to the window
we cut to the outside of the window looking in on the four as they try and get a better look outside
i forgot to ask you whod they put in charge as the new santa claus
since santa will be living out the rest of his days at a home for the religionally insane and because he had no blood heirs the kwanzaa liberation front and
the jewish defense league agreed to make the whole santa claus process a democratic vote
were all very pleased with the first santa elect
the hammer spots something up in the sky and points it out to the rest of them
look there he is now
the full moon shines brightly in the bg of the night sky as we slowly pan past rudolph and the rest of the reindeer eventually reaching the cockpit
jamal holds the reigns and waves down at mordechai and company
from the window mordechai esther mrs
carver and mun chi wave back
the hammer jewxploitation theme music begins to fade up
merry christmas jamal
merry christmas niggas
we pull away from the outside window as the four continue to wave
one by one the reindeer whip straight past camera followed by jamal
as he clears frame we
