next friday by ice cube debo is laid out on the grass
in the movies when you beat up the neighborhood bully you suppose to live happily ever after
but around here thats when all the drama begins
blue and red police lights flash over debos body
two sheriffs walk into our frame and stand over debo
they flash their lights on him
craig contd v
last friday i got fired for the first time
i got high for the first time
i got shot at for the first time and i kicked debos ass for the first time
they get him to his feet but he stumbles and falls in the bushes like a knocked out prize fighter
the sheriffs laugh at him
debo looks dazed and confused
the sheriffs help him out the bushes and start to cuff him
craig contd v
i was the man that night and debo ended up going to jail for a couple of years
but he told ezal he was getting out next friday
he said when he see me he was gonna smoke me on the spot
they walk him out of frame
craig contd v
and today is next friday
new line cinema presents etc
its early friday morning and the sun peeks over the la skyline
as the city starts to awake and the credits continue to roll we see several shots of the real people who make up los angeles
it seems that they all move to the same beat
debo is released from the twin towers county jail
still in his orange jumpsuit he walks right past us and down the street
everybody clears his path
soundtrack still pumpin
debo crosses the street passing an old man dancing and directing traffic
debo stops the man starts to dance in front of him
he stares for a second then hes on his way
still walking tall and hard he trips over a crack in the sidewalk losing cool points
three little black girls in plaid uniforms practice the latest dance steps on their way to school
debo is walking towards them
they scream and take off in the other direction
still walking he stops at a corner
a sa boy waits to cross with his low rider bike
a metrolink train passes
after it goes by we see debo riding off on the boys bike
hes on the ground holding his eye
debo continues to ride through the city
he turns a corner or two and comes to a stop at craigs house
jones dog catchers truck sits in front of the house
a chihuahua like the taco bell dog takes a dump on the lawn
it starts to bark at debo
he looks down at the dog and kicks him in the street
the dog yipes
debo focuses his attention on craigs house
the hallway is clear and quiet until mr
jones craigs father storms out of the bedroom
he struggles to put on his dog catchers uniform
he stops at the bathroom door and knocks hard
off yo ass and on yo feet this aint the time to beat your meat
jones laughs at himself
ill be out in about minutes
hurry up today is fri day
and we gotta hit the high way
jones continues on his way dancing to the beat
hands crack open a sack of bud onto the magazine
a pack of zigzags fall into frame
papers are ripped from the package
the doctor of this delicate operation
soon as my pops found out what debo said to ezal he wanted me to move with my uncle and little cousin in rancho cucamonga
til things calm down or debo went back to prison
whichever comes first
hes sitting on the toilet dressed not using it putting the finishing touches on his masterpiece
he licks rolls and slides the j into the fifth pocket on his levi jeans
craig contd v
i feel like the biggest punk around here
i wiped debos ass
he should be the one moving
the front door opens
jones walks out the door yelling back into the house
i dont wanna hit that traffic
he steps off the porch backwards and into fresh chihuahua shit
he slips and falls on the grass
jones contd i be got damn
jones gets up
he brushes the grass off his uniform
he looks clean but when he turns around dog shit is smashed all over his back and butt
jones contd craig
craig emerges from the house with his bags in hand
irritated here i come
still mad well bring yo ass on
craig slams the door and starts towards the truck
whats the matter
i fell in some mud

jones gets in the truck
craig jumps in
they back out and pull off
hes daydreaming about smokey
i didnt wanna leave my neighborhood at all
especially my homeboy smokey
but he went to rehab last week
i know imma miss him
out of nowhere debo jumps in front of the truck
jones slams on the brakes
get out the car boy
this the rematch
debo reaches for his shank
craig turns to mr
daddy punch it
jones floors it and hits debo
he falls over the hood off the car and in the street
the yellow truck speeds off
debo jumps up staggering with scrapes and bruises
you know imma find you

craig screams out the window

jones is a bit shaken up
that nigga worst than them damn pit bulldogs or something
thats why moving witcha uncle elroy and cousin day day is the best thing for you right now
with attitude yall making me look like a punk

jones grabs the air freshener from under the seat
he starts to spray too much
craigs window wont roll down
craig contd whats wrong with the window
i gotta getem fixed
they dont roll down
just hold your breath
they exit the freeway and pass a sign that reads rancho cucamonga the city away from the city
welcome to the suburbs
where the smiley happy people live in peace and quiet
the neighborhood is full of green lawns and nice two story track homes as far as the eye can see
the yellow truck drives through the streets and pulls up to a cul de sac
jones blows the horn
nice neighborhood huh
years of chasing dogs and my lazy ass brother hits the lotto his first time playing
i still cant figure that one out
why they got to have the loudest house on the block
uncle elroys house is royal blue with gold trim
all the other houses are painted in earth tones

craig pulls his belt off
he swings it and hits cheeco in the middle of his forehead with the buckle
the dog cries and runs back across the street
the jokers arent laughing anymore
joker stares at craig
craig stares back

leaving craig standing there
he sees karla walking away

craig just looks away and walks into the house
craig steps into the house

uncle elroy takes the razor and starts to cut the cigar the long way
uncle elroy contd all i smoke is blunts

cause his eyes start to bulge and he starts to toke cough with your mouth closed
it looks like hes about to bust when he lets out a big puff of smoke
then he starts to cough and cough and cough out of control
craig and suga are amazed at this display
uncle elroy falls to the floor on his hands and knees
he falls on his back and passes the blunt to craig
uncle elroy contd still coughing its the bombay
craig takes the blunt and puts it up to his lips
he hits it holds it in and looks at suga
suddenly his eyes bulge out and he starts to toke and toke and toke and toke
he starts to cough out of control and he falls next to uncle elroy whos still coughing
craig passes the blunt to suga who looks at it for a moment and then looks directly into the camera
as if to say shiiiiiiiiiiiit
all three are passed out on the couch
uncle elroy is snoring with a little slobber hanging
craigs knocked out with his mouth open
sugas head is not secure and shes starting to bob
she bobs so hard that her head falls in craigs lap
he wakes up and looks down
he looks over at uncle elroy whos looking over at him

his eavesdropping is interrupted by a loud knock on the door
craig is so comfortable he doesnt want to move
the knocking gets louder
craig gets up slowly and starts to clean the area

craig finds himself caught between suga and uncle elroy but now everything is totally still and quiet
uncle elroy starts to snore again
the coast is clear now
craig tries to make his escape
he crawls over suga to get away
she grabs him and starts to kiss him

craig breaks away and tries to hurry out the room
on his exit he hangs himself on the fuck swing and hits the floor with a thud
he scrambles to his feet then hes out of there

craig reaches into his fifth pocket

roach snatches it
craig snatches it back

day day snatches the joint and puts it in his mouth

roach pulls out a mini skateboard thats actually a lighter
weed doesnt solve problems
it eases the mind and the soul
he lights the joint
day day takes a hit
i didnt think you smoked bud that much

i got an idea
he hands the joint to craig
gets up and closes the door
then he grabs the vacuum out of the corner
roach contd this is a little theory of mine
it should work
he plugs in the vacuum and turns it on
he puts the nozzle in day days face
that aint gonna work
day day hits the j and blows into the nozzle
it quickly sucks up the smoke
passing the j it works
still gonna smell it
roach hits the joint harder than anyone else
smoke starts to come out of his ears
craig and day day get a kick out of that
a pink limo pulls to a stop
the chauffeur gets out wearing his suit just a little too tight
he opens the door and a pair of pink boots hit the pavement
the camera pans up to pinky the asshole owner
look man you hittin them goddamn corners too fast
i almost spilled my hennessy on this dollar suit
he walks over to the door
he thinks its open
pinky contd i be damn
he shakes the door
he looks inside
no ones at the counter
cassettes all over the floor
pinky looks around making sure no one sneaks up on him
he reaches under his shirt and pulls out a glock mm
sticks his key in the door and steps in
is upside down
all the blood has rushed to his head
he has chinaman eyes and a big smile on his face
roach what are you doing
r u s h intensely
a big cloud of smoke rolls out of his mouth and he falls and hits the deck
roach contd my spleen
craig and day day laugh at roach
the vacuum is still going but the room is very smoky
craig jumps in
unplugging the vacuum this vacuum dont work
wheres the restroom
out the door and to the left
i thought the vacuum would work
craig makes a left and grabs the knob
he feels something pressing on the back of his head gun
whispering dont move or ill blow your head smooth off
craig throws his hands up
pinky contd now back up slowly

pinky backs up and steps on roachs skateboard
the gun goes flying and so does he
pinky falls on his ass
the mm lands in front of craig
theres a big scramble for the gun
the mood is serious
i gotta think of a plan to get this money before tomorrow
you could sell your beamer
day day gives roach the evil eye
roach contd my bad

we gotta ask him when he comes out
lets go and clean up before pinky gets here
maybe you can ask him to loan you the money
yoooo thats it
you aint as dumb as i think you are roach
pinky and craig are still scrambling for the gun
the store looks like a tornado hit it
craig comes up with the pistol
pinky jumps on the ground

craig is exhausted
he stands over pinky with the gun
i been trying to tell yo ass that

he finishes off the last few bites of his sandwich

the beamer pulls into the driveway
our trio get out with very long faces
in a strange way i feel responsible for day day getting fired
if i wouldnt have fought pinky and gave day day the joint hed still have a job
day day walks into the house while craig and roach stay out on the porch
uncle elroy opens his bedroom door wearing a s m mask and holding a tube of ky jelly
he removes the mask
day day hands him the notice
uncle elroy takes it with his greasy hands
i got fired too
he starts to beat day day with a sex toy
the dog truck exits the freeway
he pulls into a gas station by the freeway
he stops near the restrooms and jumps out air freshner in hand
when he gets to the door its locked
jones contd say man hurry up

jones paces nervously
jones contd i knew i shouldnt have ordered that extra hot sauce
craig and day day are trying to think
roach is practicing skateboard moves

he attempts to jump off the porch with his board and lands dead on his ass once again
his board continues to roll
man sit down
i cant think with you falling everywhere
his board continues to roll into the street
at this same time jokers low rider rolls by and breaks his board in two
roach runs to pick up the pieces
the joker bros
back their low rider into the driveway
they have no sympathy
cheeco the pitbull is in the back yard
hes happy to see them
they stroll into the house with three mexican girls with them
joker spots our trio looking

they disappear into the house
craig has a twinkle in his eyes and roach walks over pissed
who the fuck is that day day

im not letting nothing go
they killed my board
let it go
craig is looking over at the jokers house
baby joker walks out the front door
he walks over to the rider and pops the wait
baby joker pulls out a chrome hydraulic pump
he carries it towards the house
cheeco starts to hump his leg
baby joker drops the pump something falls out
we cant see what it is
baby joker quickly puts it back

day day and roach look at each other
the private party is starting to heat up
big joker sits on the couch with a pretty young girl on his lap
hes smoking on a perfectly rolled cone joint
lil joker dances with the other girlfriend as an old school jam plays in the b
the other senorita is pouring herself a drink
karla walks into the room

karla storms out the room
baby joker walks in carrying the chrome pump

baby joker carries the pump in the bedroom
joker is close behind
he slams the door
the girl dancing with lil joker gets too nosy

craig day day and roach are sneaking across the street towards jokers house
craig looks calm
day day looks nervous
roach eats on a piece of baloney

day day tries to turn around
craig grabs him

roach sneaks past jokers lowrider
he slowly approaches the fence
no sign of cheeco
roach opens the pack of baloney and pulls out a slice
nervous whisper here cheeco

its pitch black behind the fence still no cheeco
craig makes a move

day day follows
he didnt have that much baloney
they sneak up to the side of the house
the music is bleeding through the walls
lil joker is dancing with all girls
theyre all getting high and feeling good
one girl has come out of her blouse
the others start to follow her lead
yelling towards bedroom hey homes you guys better hurry up

craig and day day are peeking through the window
craig moves on
day day is still watching
to himself look at those tig ole bitties craig snatches him from the window
they walk over to the fence

day day gets ready to fight
craig jumps like hes going to hit him
day day jumps back and almost falls
i hope to god that dog is happy

cheeco is nowhere to be found
roach starts to sing
my baloney has a first name

we hear a mean growl out of the darkness
roach contd my baloney has a second name it just like the first cheeco
growling gets lowder
roach contd ooooohhhh i love to eat it everyday if you ask me what ill say
we can hear tiny footsteps running at roach
roach contd cheecos got to be the dumbest fuckin mutt in the whole wide u
cheeco is running at roach full speed
he jumps on the fence and starts to bark with everything hes got
roach drops the baloney
hear the dog barking and freeze in their tracks
day day tries to run
craig grabs him again
loud whisper wait for what
a lot of barking
hes still over by roach
picks up the baloney and stuffs the whole pack into his mouth
cheeco is silenced
roach is relieved
the chrome pump is open and filled with money
baby jokers pulling out the money while joker sits on the bed counting it
they stop when they hear cheeco barking
want me to take a look
no keep working
in the mirror behind joker we see a stick slide through the curtain
the curtain cracks just enough to see craigs eye looking in
just then lil joker bursts through the door with his shirt off and two half naked girls on his arms
yo man fuck that shit

its friday time to party sa
close the door
not until you come party with us man
baby joker looks at the girls then at joker
alright put it in that drawer
joker hands baby joker the money

they start to exit the room
craig is still looking
day day is scared shitless
hes looking for cheeco
whispering what you see
that pump was full of money
i saw where they put it

no man just wait
craig climbs in the window
day day holds his stomach
i got the b gs
his meat supply is almost gone
he tries to think fast
cheeco starts to look for more meat
roach grabs the smashed brownie out of his pocket and throws it to cheeco
he swallows it in one big gulp
hes looking for more
there is no more
cheecos still growling
suddenly cheeco falls back on his butt and lets out a slight moan
cheeco is looking up at roach
hes seeing double even triple
cheeco lays down
it looks like hes faded
no lungs baby
craig is in
the bedroom door is cracked
craig walks over and shuts the door gently
he locks it
then he creeps over to the dresser
he pulls out the pump and sets it on the bed
he opens it revealing all the bundled up money packed in
he starts to stuff it in his pockets
day day is trying to keep his composure
the sa brothers are having a good time
joker is getting nasty with one of the girls
he pulls her by the hand
joker picks her up and carries her to the bedroom
he goes for the door
joker contd who locked this door
everybody looks confused
joker contd who locked this fuckin door
joker starts to kick the door
craig hurries to put the pump back
hes about to go for the window when bang
theres a kick on the door
all craig can do is go for another door on the other side of the room
the door flies open and craig is out there just in time
i dont want no doors locked around here

joker walks in and hits the lights
he throws the girl on the bed
oh poppy i like it rough
taking off shirt good cause thats how you gonna get it
baby joker has his back turned when we see craig sprint behind him and up the stairs
baby joker turns around
he thinks he saw something
he slowly starts to walk up the stairs
karla is in her room working out
craig runs in
hes shocked to see her
she doesnt see him but hes frozen

roach is on his back looking through the fence
he hits a joint and blows the smoke into cheecos face
like i was saying
