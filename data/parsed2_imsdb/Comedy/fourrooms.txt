the camera pans down a weathered wall covered with postcards from miami beach florida the copacabana n
wish you were here from niagara falls rickshaws and babes on beaches etc
the camera comes to rest on an old photograph of a s hotel the mon signor in its heyday with a full staff of people posed on the lawn in
an old guy with a staccato voice delivers a monologue there used to be a staff of fifty in this place
im the only one left from those days
it all comes down to one sap the night shift bellhop thats me
what the hell is a bellhop
you know where the name comes from
silence of course not
its so simple its stupid
they ring a bell and you hop
you hop to front and center
no heroes in this line kid
just men doing a job
no questions asked none answered
i try to keep it simple kid not too personal
another voice of a young man interrupts
you met any of those old stars
are you kidding me
i took rin tin tin out for a shit for christs sakes
i taught shirley temple how to roller skate
i saw fatty arbuckle regurgitate three cheese sandwiches right on the spot youre sitting kid
what did you say your name was
i remember marilyn used to come down at night and doze off in the kitchen
she liked the sound of the fans out back spinning around
sure these were stars kid
errol flynn used to call me alibi
youll pick up a few stories yourself kid
i dont think so not like yours
what do you think a star does when he goes to the bathroom kid
he pulls his pants down and takes a crap just like you and me
take my word for it
a wisp of smoke passes over a napkin pinned to the wall with a lip print on it signed marilyn
the camera pulls back to reveal ted and the old guy sitting on a foldout cot in a small back room of the hotel mon signor
the old man is dressed in a striped t shirt with a bellhops cap on
he looks like an old pirate
next to him on the bed sits ted a young guy with a bellhop jacket draped over his knees
the old bellhop takes a long drag off a big cigar
a good cigar wrapped in miami
i get a box of them every christmas from the chairman of the board
i think he sends them to me to keep my mouth shut
its tough not to get a little personal in this business
the old bellhop takes a hit off his cigar and stares down at his cap lost in thought
what do you mean
the old guy passes the cap over to ted
put it on
ted puts the cap on
frankly you look stupid
like the philip morris guy
i cant believe i wore that thing for fifty years
you keep it
the old guy gets up from the bed and throws a jacket on
pulls a few postcards off the wall throws them in an old straw suitcase and slams the lid down
he heads for the door
stay away from night clerks kids hookers and marital disputes
the old guy pauses for a second and looks ted dead in the eye
never have sex with the clientele
no way not me
you got any other advice
always get a tip
the door slams shut on the back room
the big empty lobby of the mon signor
you can tell that at one point this used to be a swank place
it still is kinda
its also kinda decrepit
the concierge a snappy fast talking red haired young woman in a blue blazer named betty stands behind the reception desk
the old man suitcase in hand makes a beeline through the lobby heading toward the front door
betty sees him
hey sam wait a minute
the old guy stops in his tracks and turns around
betty comes from behind the desk
i just want to say good bye
who are you
the old guy squints his eyes at the young gal
gotta light sister
goddam cigar went out
she speaks to the old guy as she lights his cigar and he puffs away
i just want you to know from the owner and all the staff your fifty years of service have been an inspiration to us all
youre a legend in your own time and the mon signor will never be the just forward my cigars red
he turns around the walks out saying over his shoulder aufwiedersehen
betty is left standing in the lobby
ted appears behind her in his bellbody uniform sans cap
sam the bellboy
now there was a man
oh hi teddy
ready to start the night shift
well let me buy you a drink
you wanna buy me a drink
im starting my shift
youre not an alcoholic are you one drink wont kill you
they walk out of frame
in the empty frame we betty and ted sit in the back room both with drinks in their hand
this dialogue is to be delivered rapid fire howard hawks style
after fifty years sam retires and youre taking over the night shift
youre filling some mighty big shoes
oh i know
sam was a legend in the hotel business
oh i know
a bellhops bellhop
an inspiration to us all
he ran the night desk for fifty years all by himself
an amazing man
no desk clerk
no night man
just fuckin sam and his wits
a man alone
and youre gonna do the same
ted spews his drink
yes you can
no i cant
i never worked the night shift before
oh night shift smight shift

i havent had a day

during the night theres nothing to do
its new years eve
whichll make it less busy than normal

what i have aint butterflies
i cant handle this hotel all by myself
betty slows the scene down
okay lets calm down a minute
slow it down cool it off
lets just talk
you can say any goddamn thing you want ted
i thought we were calming down
i thought we were cooling off
say good bye to hostility
were just talking
im calm im cool lets talk
ted in a nutshell all you have to do is hold the fort
its new years eve
most of the guests are going out
youll just be giving them a little nod as they come staggering in at three
in the morning
nobodys having any parties a few get togethers but no parties
you got about three people checking in tonight thats it
the only variable is chester rush in the penthouse
the guy from the wacky detective
yeah him and his entourage checked in last night
theyre in the penthouse
the only reason i refer to it as a variable is that hes a movie star
ya never know about movie stars
im tellin ya ted its cake
betty takes a piece of paper and writes her number down
continuing and look if you have any problems call me at the party
ted thinks about it for a moment
great for fifty bucks
youre shirking your duties for this nazi
for that you pay a price and the price is fifty bucks
one horst is not a nazi
two thats not a fair price
youre taking advantage of the situation
now twenty bucks is a fair price
yeah but what youre doin to me aint fair
and you are completely and totally taking advantage of me and your position
so fifty bucks is the perfect price
betty begrudgingly digs in her purse
okay but dont be a pussy
you dont bother me unless its an emergency
in fact for fifty bucks you better not call me unless the fuckin buildings burning down
she gives him the money
get ready to take the desk
ted sits in the chair takes another drink and prepares himself for the night
ted the bellboy meets his first guest of the evening as a taxi unloads her luggage
to his warm surprise the guest is a beautiful mediterranean goddess actually we will come to see she is not technically a goddess but a high priestess
she is about years old speaks with an italian accent and is dressed in gypsy garb
she is athena
ted takes athenas luggage onto his cart
but one item in a woven moroccan bag proves to be unbearably heavy
athena is concerned as he attempts to lift it
pleeze be careful my god
you have no idea
ted strains as he uses all his cojones to lift the insanely heavy bag onto the cart
athena tips the cab driver stingily
the driver winces and gets in the cab
ted has now managed with grunts and groans and strained blood vessels to put this thing on the cart
the cab skids away
athena looks at ted who is out of breath
im usually a good tipper but this one this cab driver he had green all around him
i dont like that in a man
ted wheezes and pounds on his chest
is that bad
like you read auras or something like that
something like that
yeah well what color are you seein around me
hows the tip lookin
i see purple
in your face and
as if she cant help herself athenas eyes are strangely drawn to his crotch
she frowns confused by this impulse
ted appears to be charmingly oblivious
athena looks back into his face
ted touches his face as if searching for the purple in it and moves the cart inside discreetly checking out his crotch and giving her a confused side glance
ted shifts hats to check the girl in
he checks her reservation
scratching his head weird name okay youre booked in the honeymoon suite just one night
with all this luggage
i will only need to stay till sunrise
and how will you be paying
he looks at this wacky gypsy chick numbly she pulls out her gold card and smiles
the doors open and ted and athena emerge upon the third floor
ted follows athena with the cart down the hallway to her room
ted opens the door then lifts the easiest bags first
in the center of the room is a jacuzzi with hokey plastic cupids poised with urns on each side
a dormant fireplace looms beyond the still hot tub
ted stares at the heavy bag with anxiety then looks in front of him to athena as she rubs the round plastic head of a little cupid and mumbles perfect
then arms open wide chin lifted to heaven eyes closed she mumbles a faint incantation
then she does a belly dance wiggle and turns to ted who is truly perplexed
well the other bag i need it
he starts to lift it again straining and turning purple
he laughs sickly
what the hell you got in here lady
she relieves him of the task and effortlessly picks up the bag
dryly the white cliffs of dover
ted is stunned as she slings the bag over her shoulder and pauses to pull a spot out of her cleavage
she hands it to him
ted is grateful and disoriented
the others will be coming soon
send them pleeze
ted nods confused by the others and walks off with the cart
then he turns from outside the doorway
oh i forgot to show you how to turn on the jacuzzi
but athena is ahead of him she flips a switch and water begins to flow from the baby cupids urns into the hot tub
i been in dis place many new years
you send the others to me huh
as she says this the door closes with a strange force shutting ted out
athena takes the bag to the bedroom of the suite
a round bed with pink tucknroll headboard
its impossible to imagine having an orgasm in this room unless it were achieved by laughing
athena carefully removes a large beautiful white slab of stone from her tapestry bag
she caresses it and carries it like a baby to the bed and places it in the very center the head of the rock resting on dusty heart shaped pillows
then she removes from her bag a pink negligee and matching high heeled slippers
and these she places with reverence on the bed
on this night oh great goddess diana we restore your virgin flesh and bring you back to real life
close on the rock slab
we hold the artifact
soon i take you to the pond for a cleansing
well its a swimming pool but it will be under the setting sun okay
just as ted is recovering from the mystery of this first guest elspeth arrives
she has skin like marble the body of venus piercing blue eyes blond hair and is dressed all in black clothing like honey west in a rubber dress
she carries several bags and a silver sword on her shoulder
may i help you
have a reservation
then she snaps irritated behind her
angle on a young punk rocker chick with long orange hair a long leather coat wearing a tight t shirt with studs spelling pussy across her breasts
this is kiva
kiva is kicking the tar and nicotine outta the cigarette machine
just as teds eyes grow wide with anxiety several packs of smokes drop into the juvenile delinquents hands
wait up gawd
i had to get supplies for this boring ass night
to ted we have a reservation in the honeymoon suite
you must be one of the others
and whatre you carrying the rock of gibraltar
she stares at him without humor
he fumbles for the key
he walks around the desk to help her with her black crocodile luggage
jars clang inside
he is ready to go but elspeth turns to lecture kiva on the hazards of smoking as kiva lights up
whatd i tell you about smoking
thats right i smoke and im addicted to it and i dont want the same thing to happen to you
in game show host voice hello welcome to this weeks edition of the hypocrite of the year award as kiva goes off on her impression of a game show host
elspeth is growing increasingly rageful like a mother with an unruly child
ted waits luggage in hand
thats enough she cuts kivas ramble off
kiva blows smoke defiantly
youre not my mother
yes i am
then whyre we sleeping together
ted looks on uneasily at the relationship that is beginning to unfold here
elspeth checks his reaction and becomes self conscious at his scrutiny
i didnt mean it
i happen to be the only one who
cares about you but her wild child looks off bored
elspeth turns to ted flustered
please take us to our room
ted smiles uneasily and reaches to relieve her of her sword but elspeth quickly slams her palm on the sword and shoots him a piercing glare
he jumps back with a light nervous laugh
he leads the way to the elevator
the couch has been set out here in the hall as well as coffee tables lamps and the tv
elspeth and kiva enter the room
athena is gone
as ted stumbles around the furniture in the hall he peers in the room and see a transformation
with most of the furniture removed candles and incense and flowers are beginning to form an altar around the fireplace
but oddest of all is the pink tinged water swirling in the jacuzzi and pouring from the cupid urns
a sprinkle of white powder on the carpet encircles the hot tub
elspeth hands him a tip as he gawks at the circle
one of the others is bringing her cat
ted starts away again perplexed
he turns for one last look to see elspeth kneeling before kiva who sprawls on the floor
he shakes his head and leaves
youre gonna have to wait in the other room
because i said so
ill watch tv
you cant watch tv because the noise will interfere with our ritual
kiva looks around the room and spies the tv in the hallway
she turns to elspeth with sarcastic concession
elspeth bristles as the brat saunters off to the bedroom
elspeth enters the sacred circle stands before the altar whips out her sword and makes a ceremonial gesture pointing the sword upward perfectly centered between her breasts
kiva behind elspeths back exits from the bedroom doorway into the hall and comes back in lugging the tv into the honeymoon bedroom
elspeth kneels before the altar
athena enters the room with the cleansed artifact and lays the slab in the center of the altar upon the heart shaped pillows as elspeth lays her sword next to
the women look upon the union with tender affection
soon our goddess will come
i will go get her negligee
athena stands up but her reverie is dispelled as she shrieks
loud tv suddenly blasts from the bedroom and kiva the brat is trying on the pink negligee over her clothes
athena takes the negligee off the irrepressible youth
what are you doing
have you no respect who who is dis girl
kiva turn off the tv
i cant leave her at home shes on probation and i gotta keep an eye on her
well elspeth your friend cannot stay here during the ritual
she may be one of your kind but she is not one of us
or i go along with my offering
the women have a stare down
then athena calls out in a seductive pout make me
elspeth becomes anxious with jealousy
athena is exasperated as she firmly demands from elspeth lets not forget i am the high fucking priestess
deal with dis girl
elspeth defers to athena with remembered reverence and respect
she bows apologetic and scurries to the bedroom
eyes lifted to heaven wearily tell me did we have these problems in salem
i dont think so
elspeth swallows her rage and approaches the brat with a soft touch
you know what i love about you
yeah she knows
your sweet side
and what do i get if im sweet
you get whatever you want
and you know what else i love about you
seduced now what
and saying this she kisses kivas nose and leaves the room
kiva is quieted now
as elspeth closes the bedroom door she has the last word
and i saw you checking her out
kiva slinks back on the bed put in her place for now
the doors open and ted pushes a cart of expensive designer luggage and lots of it behind yet another gorgeous gal
this one is jezebel a southern beauty fawning over her cat as she carries nothing else and proceeds down the hall like a southern princess
talking to her cat in baby talk oh you little stinker
oh you sweet little muffin
mama loves the baby
jezebel bursts in chattering
well this is just darlin
just darlin hi dee girls
ted carries all her bags inside awkwardly
again the place has become all the more transformed with wild canopies of exotic cloths and fixings
elspeth and athena are hard at work on a strange nature sculpture as jezebel enters
she stands inside the powdered circle and before the hot tub which now has dark blue water swirling inside
she presents her cat upward toward heaven frees the cat bares her breasts and sucks in the vibes ahhhh
ted settles the bags down hoping for a peek at her charms but her back is to him
the kitty rubs on her leg
she picks it up and presses it against her bare breasts petting it sweetly
she winks and hands him a tip
and saying this she shoos him away
through the glass doors to the bedroom she sees kiva sprawled on the bed writing on herself
well i see elspeth has herself a new lil fool what the hell is she doin here on our night of annual ritual
wearily i have sanctioned her presence as long as she behaves
come on there is more work to be done to welcome our great diana
why do i always attract girls who are looking for a babysitter
well now honey maybe juvenile hall aint the best place to find serious relationship material
elspeth seethes at her
jezebel acts blithely innocent
ted is walking from the room with the cart
his face is etched in a mask of perpetual frown as he looks at the tip in his hand at least these lunachicks tip well
waking him out of his deep mood is raven
another female intoxication she wears a short skirt all done up in native american southwestern themes
but she carries a small old handmade broom
she moves down the hall blissed out
ted makes eye contact despite himself
im looking for the room for making love
you might be referring to the honeymoon suite
straight thata way
you cant miss it see all that furniture in the hallway oh i know the way
i just wanted you to know that i knew where i was going and that you neednt bother yourself with me
the others are here great
wearily oh yeah its so great its fantastic
in deep empathy ohhh
i know it all seems very strange but youre coping with us much better than the bellboys of past new years
past new years
oh yes weve been coming here every new year
for a long time
thanks for your patience
oh hey no problem wreck the place
bring in cats
ruin the carpet with flea powder pour paint in the jacuzzi
throw the furniture out the
wherere your bags
i travel very light
ted looks down at the broom at her side her bare feets her thick dark hair
it keeps getting weirder
she wanders off
the last of the lovely girls arrives
she is different from the others
she looks like a farm girl very earth mother with a tablecloth halter top and skirt sandals and a simple scarf over her long dark curls
she carries two bags by herself and holds a small black pot under her arm
she is eva
already weary of these girls yeah yeah honeymoon suite
she lowers her eyes worried
all right lemme give ya a hand
no thats all right
i can carry them by myself
she is so sweet and sincere that he feels like a heel to have been irritated with her
he picks up her bags
im a man doin a job no hero
eva smiles beautifully
well gosh thank you
ted holds evas hippy sacks as she holds her black pot
there is a shy quiet tension here
tell me how long have the others been here
about an hour
evas heart sinks
they arrive at the door
he carries her bags in
the room is entirely transformed into a beautiful glowing palace with an elaborate altar both earthly and the other earthly
the other four girls are arranging the altar as eva enters
you are very late eva
im sorry athena
i was attending a birth and the placenta was late in coming
ted is slightly queasy
she hands him a tip and smiles then takes it back
oh wait lemme give you a little more than that
teds no fool he waits while eva looks through her change purse
which birth is more important to you that of a mortal or that of a goddess
all life is precious
but i do apologize for being late elspeth
back home they jist yank on the umbilical cord do a karate chop on the mamas belly and them things come right out
they do that here too jezebel in the hospitals but it causes hemorrhages
i fed the mother a bowl of comfrey tea and it brought the afterbirth down perfectly
the couple are going to use it for fertilizer to plant a lovely tree for their baby
oh wow if they were really back to nature theyd eat it like other mammals do
close on teds face as he gets thoroughly grossed out
in some native american cultures they dry the umbilical cord grind it to a fine powder and put it in a leather pouch that the baby wears to ward off
but burying the placenta is also a very sound ecological practice cause of the oxygen it carries
cheerfully to the others yes because you see when the placenta detaches from the uterine wall
wincing in disgust uh thank you ladies ill be going now
if you need anything eva places a nice tip in his palm
we do need a few things
ted sighs as eva enters the circle with her black pot
she kneels softly holds her hands in piety before the altar and softly incants as she offers her pot and places it on the altar
the stone and sword and flowers now rest here on pillows covered in chiffon scarves
the negligee hangs from the mantel the slippers underneath as if expecting someone to materialize into the garments
we need fresh rosemary from the kitchen
mostly what we need is from the kitchen
hey are you listening
ted is watching eva enchanted
yeah yeah rosemary
and a little bit of sea salt or kosher salt if you dont got no sea salt
a bottle of spring water italian please not french shit
and some french fries
kiva shut up
irritated and some ginger two of the eyes of a trout fish and a piece of raw meat liver if you have it
whining i want fries you dumb jerks with your stupid fucking ritual
shut up you little shit
dont talk to her that way
ted has scribbled down the items as she speaks
he looks at this list and these girls and shudders as he walks away
he turns points at eva
ted smiles at this angel of a girl
she smiles back
but as she looks him in the eyes he feels a strange buzzing connection happening
he holds his head almost swooning with dizziness
get to work man
ted comes out of his daze looks at the list again and huffs off
after he goes the girls begin to bring forth their most treasured offerings in ornate ancient bottles vases or vials
jezebel folds her arms and clears her throat in the direction of kiva sitting idly on the edge of the blue water jacuzzi with her feet dipping irreverently in the
you have to go in the next room now
oh wow like im bummed out that i cant watch
whining at elspeth im bored
she climbs up the stairs trying to pull the brat to her feet
dont put me in there by myself
ill miss you way too much
kiva dont do this to me
kiva sees a bit of weakening here she takes her feet out of the jacuzzi
she begins to speak softly
if you just lemme
ill play dress up with you the way you like it
you know what i mean
elspeth begins to weaken
but continues to pull the brat up
kiva pours on softer seduction
we can pretend and ill do it exactly
the way you want it
with the egg whites and the kilt
elspeth is now fully seduced
kiva takes elspeths hand and presses it lightly on her face
like last week
elspeth is enthralled but from a disgusted ick sound from jezebel elspeth realizes shes revealing this side of her life in front of her coven
she nervously looks around and see all the coven looking at her a disgusted jezebel an understanding raven a preoccupied eva and an impatient and stern athena
elspeth comes to her senses straightens her posture
well talk about this later kiva
she turns on elspeth and bites her hand
elspeth pulls her arm away and grabs kiva by the hair
aw really now child abuse
you stay outta this
i demand this stop now elspeth
elspeth lets go of kivas hair
kiva jerks away from her
im running away from you
and ill call your parole officer and shell find you and send you back to eastlake
kiva stomps off into the bedroom
now that the fucking melodrama is over can we start the goddamn ritual pleeze
elspeth enters the powered circle
each girl takes off her shoes
they anoint themselves with oils
we are communing here on new years eve to bring to life the great goddess diana who was turned to stone in this very room forty years ago today
the girls moan in sleepy eerie agreement as they begin to sway within the circle
diana great beautiful one we make these offerings to you that we may undo the wicked spell which deprived you of the seed of your lover your virginal blood of
your very life
we now form the symbolic rock with our bodies
and saying this the girls all form a rock with their bodies gracefully draped one upon the other
music begins and slowly they start to unfold from the rock
the girls each find their place in a semicircle around the jacuzzi
some bare their breasts other strip off a layer of clothes
they anoint their arms with water from the jacuzzi
they begin a lovely dance snaking their way around the semicircle
the first one to go from one end to the other is athena
she then proceeds up the stairs and positions herself between the altar and the jacuzzi
she steps forth with a bottle to the altar and pours it into the jacuzzi
on this night in this hour we call upon the ancient power o goddess bride i offer thee milk from a mothers sweet titty
each of the girls moans eerily
athena places the bottle on the altar and bows away
she joins the circle as elspeth now steps forward with her offering in a vial
to reverse the evil which has been done i make this offering to the divine one a whore not an innocent was for whom i seized a virgins blood
goddess of light goddess of lust to undo this awful spell is a real must
to bring you life and get you high i offer the sweat of five mens thighs
the girls moan loudly as they sway
jezebel places her offering in the hot tub and bows out returning to the circle
now raven comes forth with a small leather canteen
she unscrews the lid as she offers in her opiate stupor
diana oh great one we live without sun until this wicked curse is undone
in hope that you live and to us appear i have collected a years worth of tears
she pours liquid into the mix as the witches moan
now its evas turn
eva continues to sway not moving forth to the altar
the girls keep their eyes closed as they sway waiting for evas offering
athena finally gives her a push and she goes
eva kneels before the altar
she produces a silver bottle with a chain on its cap and neck
she timidly begins to incant
great goddess diana fail you i will i was to bring fresh sperm from my bill
i had him erect and his semen would follow but alas i was hot so hot that i swallowed
the moans turn to wails as the girls gasp and shriek
athena opens her eyes wildly
you stupid little witch
you swallowed the sperm
aye yi yi
elspeth opens her eyes and folds her arms smirking bitterly
it just shows what an amazing lack of control you have over yourself eva
honey why didnt you just use your hands
didnt your mama teach you not to put them things in your mouth
i understand though
eva bursts into tears
athena is firm
there is no time to cry over swallowed sperms
youre gonna have to get some baby
you have one hour to prove what kind of witch you really are
just then a knock at the door
calling out what do you want
athena smiles and turns to eva
bellboy come right in
ted opens the door
his eyes bulge out as he looks upon the fleshly feast
he steps back
they giggle seductively all except eva who sniffles red eyed
amazingly teds attention is captivated by evas sorrow not by the naked charms of the other witches
she shyly covers her breasts
sensitive to her shame and sorrow he looks away and steps from the door to fetch the room service cart
athena directs the others to put on their shirts
ted wheels in the cart
heres the things you asked for
oh and uhh sorry but im not gonna pick the eyes outta this dead fish
he points to the trout
elspeth picks it up flings the eyes into the jacuzzi and tosses the trout out of the window
she smirks at him comtemptuously
handing ted bucks okay mister heres your fifty dollar tip only you have to do one more thing
make our little eva smile
well leave you alone
to eva firmly and dont use your mouth
the girls step out
athena turns to eva and points to her watch then holds up one finger
eva looks up worried
the door closes on her and ted
she looks at ted and sighs
he covers her with a shawl
the other witches listen at the door
if she doesnt get his goop in ten minutes im going to take him myself
thatll be a first for you
oh shit kiva
she runs back in for her bratty girlfriend who is already sneaking out the bedroom door
and just where do you think youre going
well gawd i need a candy bar or something you havent fed me all day
im getting all shaky
my blood sugars really low
elspeth honestly now some babysitter youre turnin out ta be
i will collect fresh earth
jezebel i want you to gather damp moss
raven you bring me a birch branch
elspeth you go feed your terrible girlfriend
we meet back here in one hour and lets all have faith that eva can get this guy off
the witches disperse
eva sits among pillows before the altar as ted stands in front of her
ted is trying his best to make poor eva smile
but no matter what his antics she looks off sadly
help me out lady
i gotta earn this fifty bucks
oh look they dont care if i smile or not
all they want is
ted waits she sighs and rest her chin in her hand
you wont understand believe me
she begins to cry tearfully again
ive been around yknow
he postures proudly all puffed out
eva looks at him helplessly
and he paternally encourages her to explain
the five of us elspeth jezebel athena raven and me are a coven
ha like a coven of witches
he looks around the room quick cuts of candles iconography jars of lurid substances unknown body parts of animals woven into the nature sculpture
and are those tongues in that can
teds getting the creeps but again puffs himself up
i knew that
getting calmer and you see our coven has spent forty years trying to perfect a ritual to undo a wicked curse put on our goddess diana
gee you dont look a day over twenty
i mean the witches before us tried and failed
but athena our high priestess discovered a great potion to reverse the evil spell which turned our beautiful goddess into an old rock
looking at the rock yeah
is that her
eva nods looking lovingly at the stone
she was a beautiful virgin
an entertainer by trade but a great sorceress by design
it was here in this very room on her wedding night a jealous rival placed the curse on diana
she turned to that here
and her young husband turned into a pink fish
they found him swimming in the pool in circles
while our dear goddess a stone in her honeymoon bed
ted frowns as he ponders all this
eva takes a photo from the altar and hands it to ted
this was diana
close on photo a blond bombshell in full on betty page attire a bare tittied pinup girl playfully spanking a girl in bondage with a spiked high heel
this girl here
this is the goddess diana
the photograph slowly comes alive
diana stops spanking the girl and unties her
she pulls the girl in the black satin mask up off her lap and makes the girl stand
the women face each other and break into a cheek to cheek tango
close on ted as he shakes his head
are his eyes playing tricks on him
i hate to tell you this but i kinda doubt she was a virgin
oh but she was
she had lovers but she saved that for marriage
which is the example ive tried to follow to do everything but that till i marry
she begins to sob again
ted comforts her
hey dont cry
a virgin is a rare and beautiful thing
if you say she was a virgin ill believe it
well it doesnt matter now
and she wont be resurrected tonight cause i failed her
i let my whole coven down
wait a sec that rock was gonna turn back into this
he holds up the photo
now that would be something worth seeing
only not now we were each supposed to bring something a life fluid
wincing in disgust if this is gonna be like one of those afterbirth conversations i dont think i wanna hear this
i swallowed it
you swallowed what
eva looks off
ted searches his brains thoroughly sickened now
you mean you were supposed to bring
like a guys
she nods he winces queasy
eva looks at him helpless
and now youre my last chance
laughing yeah sure
then panic whoa what
you want my for the witchy poo ahh no no way nope
besides its against hotel policy
i was warned no sex with the clientele
eva sobs pleading
she throws off her shawl baring her lovely breasts and reaches her arms around his neck
he keeps backing off
unbeknownst to him he is already doing a ritualistic shuffle
ha cmon now jokes over
seeing this is no joke hey were gonna step in the flea powder
thats not flea powder thats sacred dust ground from the horns of albino goats
i knew that
he is backing away into the circle as she comes for him soft and sweet
her eyes are again putting the magic hex on him as he tries to resist her gaze
whats a nice girl like you doing in a coven anyway
well see what i really want to do is be a midwife
ive attended four births already
i can prevent vaginal tears and everything
trying to dodge her hexing eyes well thats a good thing
a guy doesnt like surprises down there
all the while she is stepping toward him into the circle
i joined the coven to attain greater understanding of my feminine power so i could become a truly great midwife
the hex working now oh well i see youve been gaining a lot of insight into your
eva sweetly takes his hand and places it on her breast
do you really think so
buckling under the temptation well yeah id say that seems to be the case
she licks his neck his eyes roll back heavenly ohhh god
bettys gonna kill me
whos betty your girlfriend
they fall into a kiss as she begins to remove his cap
she moves him toward the jacuzzi closer and closer
ted pushes his room service cart
he is flushed
lights a cigarette takes a great big satisfied drag
eva runs to the door dreamily her naked body wrapped in her shawl
she passes him a card
my phone number in topanga
cocky sure baby
yeah ill give ya a call
she smiles and shuts the door
the other witches are arriving with supplies from the garden
kiva now having raised her blood sugar sucks on a lollipop a sunny girl
she talks to raven who carries a birch limb
whats that used for
its a birch branch symbolizing eternal life
you can also use the bark for a tea which assists in astral travel
hey i wanna be a witch
the other girls roll their eyes as elspeth smiles proudly
ted blows smoke at them and pushes his cart off down the hall
the witches run inside the room
eva sits blissed out in the center of the circle smiles
im a woman now
but where is his stuff
pointing to the jacuzzi we did it right there in the big cauldron
ooohhh honey youre gonna be sore tomorra
didnt your mama teach you that water strips a girls lubrication
sex in water is great in the movies not in real life
but you will learn
as we all did
yeah when she cant walk
to elspeth i guess you wouldnt have those kinds of problems without penetration
and virtually no cervical cancer either
okay girls enough sex education lets get going with our ritual goddammit
athena regally leads the ritual as they all bare their breasts again
kiva throws off her shirt to join in
as she does we see black bondage tape on her nipples
elspeth darts a quick look at the tape looks at the other witches not sure she likes this but she goes with it
the witches sway in a circle eyes closed as eva makes her offering
goddess diana i offer you the jism of one i wooed for you that you may live and know such bliss of getting laid by a guy like this
the witches all incant
so must it be
three times three times three
they march half naked as they moan and revel in eerie cries
the jacuzzi begins to bubble and boil
their cries heighten the potion bubbles over
athena reads from a huge leatherbound book the book of shadows full of potions and spells
four discouraged witches pack their bags
the room has been restored to its worldly under splendor
kiva uses the remote on the tv
so much for witchcraft
the slab of rock remains a slab
i dont understand what went wrong
i say eva pulled one over on us
honey eva was wearing the face of someone just fucked good
and the best actress in this world or any other cant fake a thing like that
exactly if she was fucked so good how could she save his come
it could be done
girls knock it off
she looks up from the book maybe
maybe it needed to be the sperm of a virgin male
dreamily he was no virgin
the witches sadly collect their things
athena deep in thought strokes the slab
lets leave her here with the sword until dawn
i will come back for her before checkout time
feel too sad to carry her away before the sun comes up to warm her
they all agree
they pick up their bags and head out
cuddling her cat i cant believe we have to carry our own bags out
my mama would have a hissy fit
flirtatiously ill carry your bags
firmly youre carrying my bags
they leave the room
jezebels cat leaps from her arms as she hoists her luggage
eva walks out satisfied thought perhaps a little sore ouch she says and smiles
athena takes one last look at their goddess slab
next year we try again with virgin sperm
she closes the door on the honeymoon suite till next new years eve
ted behind the desk on the phone
we only hear his side
oh jesus what did i tell you
do you want milk and cookies or do you not
pause i cant turn on an adult station without permission from your parents
pause he checks his computer thats not what the machine tells me
pause you be good and youll get milk and cookies but for now leave me alone please
ill be up later to put you both to sleep
he hangs up
to himself goddamn kids
the phone rings again
a small party is going on
a long haired yuppie scum type in on the line
people dance in background
what room am i in
this is the front desk sir
the yuppie turns away from the phone and speaks to real theodore
what room are we in
how should i know
i just got here
into phone you know dont you have one of those light things
if you care to go to the door and look on the other side youll find the room number
to real theodore call my assistant and ask her what floor were on
whos your assistant
the girl you party with every night
to himself who
im here alone sir
its room i think
i could have sworn we were on the fifth floor
into phone right
what do you need sir
to real theodore what do we need
into phone ice
ill be with you momentarily
ted saunters down a hallway with a butt hanging out the corner of his mouth and a bucket of ice swinging at his side
he pulls up at a door on which the faded numbers read something like room
ted knocks on the door
after a moment the latch is thrown and the door swings open
ted cautiously steps into the dark room
a demonic cackle cuts through the darkness
no one here but us chickens
say its pretty dark in here sir
what do you expect theodore a fuckin floor show
do i know you
i dont know
in a flash the lights switch on and ted finds himself staring down the barrel of a pretty intense looking
magnum cocked and ready to fire
at the other end of the gun stands a year old man sigfried who sports a cheshire cat smile and a just try fuckin with me look on his face
sigfried isnt the only person in the room
directly behind him sits a beautiful young woman angela gagged and bound to a chair
ted drops the bucket to the floor
i brought your ice
in fact the whole getups kind of cute
the monkey suits a nice touch honey puss
this has to be a mistake
is this room
what do you take me for theodore
a very upset man
sigfried reaches in his pocket and throws a handful of assorted stimulants into his mouth chewing on them like they were breath mints
sigfried thrusts his hand forward gripping ted by the throat and leads him to angela
to angela i am an upset man theodore
how do you know my name sir
im psychic theodore
look my name is ted actually and i have no idea whats going on here but ive obviously come at a bad time
lets not belabor the fact that you have no sense of timing theodore
the fact is youre here
sigfried turns to angela
continuing and i couldnt think of a better time for you to introduce me to your beau than on new years eve
oh fuck theres a mistake
youre fucking wrong here
my name is theodore yes
my mother named me that and i hate the name
but im a fucking bellhop
people call me ted
i work here
suddenly with great force sigfried slams the butt of his pistol smack into teds temple sending him to the floor
ted looks up at sigfried in shock
look id love to sit here all night with you talking about things like when you broke in your first mitt pause that was insensitive of me wasnt it t
h e o d o r e
but lets cut to the chase okay
a tense silence fills the room
all eyes are on ted who cant figure out what the fuck this guy wants
sigfried looks hard with disbelief at ted who winces back
you are really beginning to annoy me theodore
sigfried throws another handful of pills into his mouth
look obviously you two are working something out and if i could help you with your problem i would
what are you saying
are you saying i got a problem
are you trying to say i dont give her what she needs
that im fucking insensitive
look is this about another man
ted has struck a raw nerve
sigfrieds mood swings drastically he bends down next to ted
lets get our abcs right here theodore
are you saying my wife cheats on me
i didnt say that
oh for christs sake theodore this is about as intimate a situation as you can get you me and angela here
its pretty cozy
to say nothing of how stupid an idea it is to lie to a man with a loaded gun without considering the possible response
i demand an apology
the phone rings
ive got to take this
sigfried glances at it
then to angela
he picks up the phone
into phone what
pause we aint got any needles here kid
just a big fucking gun
he listens to the other line says good bye and hangs up
to ted now where was i
oh yeah i remember
sigfried kneels next to ted and assumes a prayer position
i want you to pray for forgiveness theodore
sigfried hands clasped together signals for ted to do the same
the gun lies at his side
ted considers a bold move but thinks better of it
sigfrieds eyes pop open
he cuts a look to ted signaling him to assume the pose
continuing now say after me i apologize
ted looks to angela for help
she can only stare back with intense wide open eyes
for fucking what
that i said you might have been unfaithful
that i said you might have been unfaithful
listen theodore youre in church here
youre kneeling in front of an altar
truth is all it hears
say the following i theodore must humbly and sincerely apologize for saying that you fucked another man
ted repeats what sigfried has told him
this appears to have a calming effect on sigfried who gets up off the floor turning his face to angela
continuing do you accept the fucking apology
naturally angela says nothing
continuing you always gotta get the last word dont you
its one way with you angela isnt it
i give and i give and i get nothing back
sigfried turns to ted
continuing she just sits there waiting for me to jump through hoops
angela attempts to speak through the gag
both men wait with bated breath for a response
sigfrieds had enough
continuing stupid me for a second i thought you were going to say something
something like im sorry
youre absolutely right love cakes i wouldnt want it that way
thats one thing you can say about angela
shell never do anything she doesnt want to do
if the feeling aint there she just isnt going to do it
there is nothing in this world as fucked as a woman who gives when she doesnt want to
never let that happen to you theodore
it makes you feel very little indeed
ted beckons sigfried
you mind if i
spit it out
i dont mean to upset you further sir but i think she was trying to say yes
are you condescending to me theodore
absolutely not i would never do that
why dont you just say it
that you think im an idiot
i would never say that
you think youre superior to me dont ya theodore
you dont think i notice there is a gag in the womans mouth
of course you do
naturally of course
and do you know how i know that
because i put the gag in her mouth
im gonna let you in on a little secret about communication theodore
its all in the eyes
points the gun at ted him
turns the gun on himself or me
him or me
lets drag it out
sigfried empties the last of the pills into his mouth heaving the empty bottle over his shoulder
he takes off disappearing into the bathroom
ted finds himself alone with angela
they lock eyes
angela implores ted to lean forward
ted sizes up the situation his chances of making it to the door are slim due to the fact that he would have to pass by the bathroom door
ted paces back and forth in front of angela who struggles to get his attention
he whips around and they face off in what appears to be a game of charades
ted finally gets the point and cautiously removes the gag from angelas mouth
angela spits an old sock out
we dont have time to play charades here asshole
untie me quick
listen lady i dont know what in the hell is going on here but id appreciate it if you would explain to that nutcase that hes making a big mistake
look whether you like it or not youre in the middle of a situation here you cant just wish your way out of
but ive never seen you people before were complete strangers
everyone starts out strangers ted its where we end up that counts
ted wrestles with the idea of whether to untie angela or not
i dont know if i can do this
its too hard
life is hard ted
you ever stopped to consider how many times you change your underwear in a lifetime
on nervous impulse ted begins the calculations
i dont mean literally you ignoramus
forget it listen to me
theres a gun in my suitcase behind the bed its loaded
im not going to shoot anybody
get the gun and ill shoot anybody
and make me an accessory in the murder of your husband
ted collapses to his knees in front of angela
thats not fair
it just isnt fair
get a fucking grip on yourself
first off who says hes my husband
and second we are a long way from fair here fair is back in jolly old england eatin crumpets and sipping on tea
ted collects himself
not so fast
well maybe there are two sides to this thing
there are two sides to a plate still you only eat off of one
now get the so whys he got you tied up
im a werewolf ted
get the gun
ted is at a loss as to what to do
angela turns on the charm
come on ted
come over here just for a minute
you can do it
come on ted
you look like a good guy
ted creeps towards her
thats it teddy
you look so much more attractive when youre self assured
sigfried suddenly comes to life
hes heard from the bathroom belting out life is but a dream
she boom she boom
she panics quick hes coming back
put the gag back in and remember the gun
ted hurries to replace the sock in her mouth
nine thousand three hundred and twenty two times to the best of my estimation
sigfried coughs sending a chill up teds spine
ted whips around to discover sigfried leaning up against the door to the bathroom
i was just beginning to think i could trust you theodore
teds fingers are frozen over angelas lips
i was just trying to help her breathe a little
dont let me stop you teddy
you dont mind me calling you teddy do you
i used to have a little bunny rabbit named teddy it looked real cute nibbling on angelas ear
only problem here is youre no bunny rabbit theodore and it really fuckin razzes me to picture you doin it
but dont let me stop you teddy
no need to play sneaky poo
ted starts to back toward the door
look man if this is some kind of voodoo thing and you want me to have sex with your wife there is absolutely no way
shouts at the top of his lungs i said nibble asshole
the directness of sigfrieds command coupled with the sound of a trigger being cocked forces ted to approach angela
angela is a stunning beauty and ted being kind of a shy guy makes for an awkward situation
ted leans forward
as he closes in angelas eyes close
whispers sorry lady
ted pulls up short of actually nibbling on angela
whats the matter no whiz left in the cheese
im not cramping your style am i
look im not playing this game anymore
sigfried yanks ted backwards
he wraps his arms around him
its almost all over theodore and soon you can go home to mommy
ted struggles to free himself from sigfrieds powerful bear hug and blasts out the following monologue
my name is not theodore its ted teddy not theodore
yes my mother did me the service of naming me theodore and i havent a clue as to how you know that because everyone who knows that lives a long
way away from here
do you have any idea what its like to go to school where all the other kids parents are in jail doing time for crimes like grand larceny aggravated assault
burglary and murder and you get stuck with a mother who names you theodore and dressed you up in little matching pink outfits with get this a little blue bow fucking tie
well ill tell you what happens
pretty soon theodore becomes theo the thumper and when theo the thumper gets old enough he packs his bags and goes thousands of miles away where he can put the
whole bloody mess behind him
so if you dont mind shoot me now because no one is going to call me that again
my name is ted okay
sigfried has followed the entire tirade in stunned silence
he takes a step toward ted and offers him his hand
my name is sigfried
sigfried cuts a something wrong with that
look at ted
nice to meet you sigfried
ted cautiously takes sigfrieds hand
very impressive ted
theo the thumper
its a deal kid
ted it will be
sigfried holds onto teds hand
the soft sound of distant fireworks pops in the background
car horns and a muffled countdown signal that its new years
sigfried moves uncomfortably close to ted and from out of nowhere bolts forward planting a wet kiss right on teds mouth
something snaps in sigfried
he is either really getting off on this or he is caught in the grips of a seizure
he doubles back on the floors
ted and angela watch as he flops around like a flounder with the cocked gun waving all over the place
ted wipes his mouth with his jacket sleeve while trying to dodge the barrel of the gun
you okay mister
ill get help
sigfried manages to steady the gun and point it directly at ted
he signals for ted to go to the bathroom
continuing thats the wrong door sir
sigfried grabs ted by the leg and shove the barrel of the gun into his crotch
sigfried pulls teds face closer to his
get me the nitro
its in the bathroom cabinet
ted rushes into the bathroom leaving sigfried a babbling mess behind
ted enters the bathroom which appears shaken by an earthquake
towels and wet clothes are all over the place
an evening gown is flushed halfway down the toilet and pills are everywhere
sigfried is shouting from the other room to hurry
ted checks the cabinet searching for a bottle marked nitro
ted spots a small window set above the toilet
he figures this is the best chance hes got to make a break
ted goes for it
he manages to get his head and one arm through the window before he gets stuck
his legs dangle in the bathroom
struggle as he may he can only hit the toilet bowl lever which sends a loud flush sound out through the apartment
shouting in the distance its no time to take a leak teddy im fucking dying here
outside the window teds in another world
hes almost safe
its a strange feeling kind of like bathing in warm water in paradise knowing a huge shark is ready to rip his ass off
he can see the flickering red glowing light from the witches room from the floor below
ted sees eva bopping naked past the window
he shouts her name out to no avail
the music drowns out his voice and they ignore his calls for help
the blood rushes to his head
he lets himself hang there for a moment
he wonders how many other people have found themselves in situations like this before him
right next to his face ted recognizes a bloody hand print
its not his blood
ted hears a sound from above and twists himself around spotting a young man previously seen as the yuppie scumbag on the phone leaning out of the window directly above
after a quick moment of sizing him up ted gathers himself
somethings wrong with the guy all the blood is drained from his face and he is mumbling something
listen im stuck here in a situation that i cant even begin to explain but would you be so kind as to get help
could you call the police please
continuing you okay
the young man manages to belt out the word ice just before hurling a mouthful of vomit toward ted
it takes all teds strength to dodge the puke and pull himself back into the bathroom
he falls back on the floor
he props himself up and checks for damage
he notices something odd
the room is silent
he walks into the bedroom
ted looks around the still room
no ones there
he heads toward the door and from out of the corner of his eye he spots sigfrieds hairy leg
sigfried has passed out on the floor
angelas chair has been knocked on its side
ted races over to help lift her back up
he pulls the gag from her mouth
angela jumps all over him
wheres the fucking nitro
i couldnt find it
you took long enough
untie me for christs sake you fucking upset him and hes dying
ted struggles to untie angela
i thought you wanted to kill him
youd make a great cop theodore
the knots are all over the place and a real bitch to untie
i cant handle this alone id better get help
ted turns on a dime and runs smack into sigfried whos been taking in the whole conversation
i tie a pretty good knot dont i ted
thank god youre okay
never felt better
angela hears sigfrieds voice from behind her back
to angela come on honey dont get mad
it was just a little test and im glad i did it because now ill know forever that you really do love me
truly and deeply
if the simple fact that i didnt want your bloated dead body lying out on the floor is love then no wonder we find ourselves as we are at this
very fucking moment
i heard you and there was genuine care in that voice
cant be denied
can it ted
i think youre right and if you just keep this kind of open dialogue going youll go a long way to resolving this misunderstanding
ted edges his way toward the door
continuing youd be surprised what happens when people just listen to each other without succumbing to all that pain and anger
you heard shit monkey boy
easy for you to say after you fuck another mans wife
you should at least have the guts to stand by your convictions
sigfried turns an icy eye on ted who has given up all hope of ever getting out of the room
thats a lie sigfried
i swear to god
angela continues her tirade
when i think of all the times you were inside me promising me a better life it makes me want to puke
sigfried slowly raises his gun pointing it directly at teds chest
why are you doing this
what have i ever done to you people
what didnt you do stick man
unfortunately you dont have the balls to back up the actions of your huge cock
the words hit sigfried like bullets to the chest
his legs weaken
whimpering hes got a huge cock
shes lying again mister
its not that big
show it to me
come on man shes lying
cant you see shes fucking with you
put it this way god made up for what he did to gumby with ted here
show it to me
show him your cock theodore
sigfried runs over to angela and kneels in front of her
stop talking about his cock will you
its hard to stop talking about something so huge
i could go on and on about his cock bone nob bishop wang thang hotrod
hump mobile oscar dong dagger banana cucumber salami
sausage kielbasa schlong dink tool big ben mister happy prick disk pecker peter pee pee wee wee weiner pisser pistol joint hose horn middle leg third leg meat stick joystick
angela is on a roll
she fires the words at sigfried hitting him pointblank
he pleads with her to stop covering his ears
ted watches the man crumble
continuing junior the little head little guy rumple foreskin tootsie roll
snake one eyed monster one eyed wonder shaft sword meat whistle skin flute love muscle roto rooter instrument banger rammer ramrod cherrypicker log pole
sigfried tries jamming the sock back in her mouth to stop the flow she manages to give him a fuck of a bite in the process
meanwhile ted figures this to be his moment to make a move and bolts for the door only to be tackled by sigfried at the one yard line
after a struggle the two men rest on the floor catching their breath in a relaxed embrace
please dont leave me
ill call you ted from now on
its not me mister i swear
personally i dont give a fuck ted its just i dont want to be alone right now
im feeling a little vulnerable
sigfried heaves the gun over his shoulder grabs a half empty bottle of jack daniels and passes it to ted who takes a hit
continuing no guns okay
just you and me ted
you know my father used to say that forgiveness is the only thing that evil cant sink its teeth into
kind of nice down here on the floor isnt it ted
things take on a whole new perspective
youd like my trust wouldnt you ted
yes i would
i just got one thing to ask you and ill let you go
tell me straight now
what was it like
what was what like
you know you and her
oh for fuck sake sigfried what do you want me to say
either way youre fucked right
you ever gonna see her again theodore
if i ever saw her again id run the other way
sigfried releases ted and stands up
youre lying but i can respect that ted
if you told me it would no longer be a secret and secrets have a power kid
you open that box and they disappear forever
a bad secret will rip you apart but the good one are all you got
in the end when all the people you knew are dead and gone all youll have left are you secrets
and when you die the box is open and it all blows away dust to dust all the anger jealousy desire and love just blow away
sigfried throws his hand out to help ted up
continuing so you know what i say lets call it a truce kiddo
sigfried takes ted by the hand and leads him to an open window
ted is overcome by the sweetness in sigfrieds voice and follows him to the window willingly
the two men look out into the dark los angeles night
continuing im a man of love theodore
love is all i live for
i can see that
maybe to a fault
dont beat yourself up over it
thats nice of you to say ted but i probably should make a clean break of it cut her loose and get my own place
i just cant imagine living without her
do you think i should seek professional help
its not for everyone but maybe in your case it could help
you ever been out on the ocean at night
ted shakes his head
continuing i have
scary as a motherfucker all that darkness around you
its like a big black carpet rolled out as far as the eye can see
sometimes if youre lucky youll see a light
it could be as small as a little spark but it will cut a path straight through all that blackness straight to you
it could be another boat or some distant fire on an island but that light will shed a shining path of diamonds cutting through mile after mile of darkness to
lie at your feet
thats love ted its like a path of light in an ocean of darkness
ted and sigfried stare out of the window in peace transfixed by the glimmering lights of the city
a loud shot rings out shattering the still moment
the two men spin around
angela stands there with a smoking gun hanging at her side
sigfried drops to his knees
ted checks him out no blood
angela has fired the gun into the floor below
ted looks up at angela
angela opens the chamber of the pistol and hands the bullets to ted
to ted youd better go check to see if i killed anybody downstairs
sigfried is bent over silently weeping on the floor
you people gonna be okay
angela sits next to sigfried and gently strokes his back
were fine ted
ted points to a tray with half eaten food on it
would you like me to
another time ted
ted slowly walks toward the door and takes one last look at the strange couple at rest in the corner of the room before closing the door behind him
ted walks down the hallway lost in thought
an energetic young guy with a bouquet of flowers plows into him
happy new year buddy
happy new year
i was just in room what a party
you know where room is at
its somewhere around here
the guy takes off in the direction teds walking from
ted suddenly realizes who this guy is and whips around shouting to the young guy
continuing hey whats your name
the door slams on room
ted is relaxing at the front desk
he breathes slowly
he finally has one moments peace after an already long night
he even has a chance to straighten his tie
the phone rings
close up of a cigarette hanging out of a mans mouth as he speaks into the telephone
bottle of moet et chandon
man hangs up the phone and stubs out his cigarette into an already overstuffed ashtray by the bed
man turns around to face the camera
he is a dark and handsome latin male in his mid s
he walks toward the camera as he continues straightening his tie
he stops at the door of the bathroom and watches his wife and two kids get ready for the party
wife seems to be a beautiful woman in her mid s
the children are sarah nine and juancho six
man strikes up another cigarette and finishes his tie
he watches his wife comb juanchos hair down and to the side like an idiot
not being able to stand it anymore man tears juancho away from his wife and snatches the comb
give me that
man begins to slick juanchos hair back
you look cool with your hair up like this
juancho is smiling now
hes happy hes going to look like his dad
not down and to the side all stupid like your mom likes to comb it
juancho looks over at sarah who is going through the tortuous ritual of having her mother brush the tangles out of her long unmanageable hair
wife seems to be taking out her aggressions on the tangled mess
man is starting to have problems of his own with juanchos hair
juanchos hair is thinner than mans so it wont stay up
man puts down his cigarette in order to get a better handle on it
we see the frustration growing in his face
juancho picks up the cigarette and pretends hes smoking too just like his dad
man tears the cigarette away from juancho and smokes it down to the filter
he looks at his own cool hair and then down at juanchos which wont stay up
man flicks the cigarette butt into the toilet in frustration
youve got your mothers hair
in anger man starts messing up juanchos hair
i cant do anything with it
furious man simply swipes juanchos hair back down and to the side the way wife had it before
juancho looks like an idiot again
juancho slouches past everyone as he exits the bathroom
sarah watches him leave as her own hair is finished
putting a plastic clip in sarahs hair there
wife then finishes her own gorgeous hair
man lights up a new cigarette
mocking so are we gonna have fun tonight
man blows smoke in wifes face as he walks out of the bathroom
i didnt think so
sarah has joined juancho in watching television
man watches the children watch tv
we can see the wheels turning in mans head
he turns back to the bathroom
he watches wife now
practically burning rubber
wife puts the lipstick down and turns to her husband
she is beautiful
shrugs lets just leave the kids here
wife glances out at the children eyes glued to the tube
here in the room
with the television
wife thinks about it for a second
she shrugs a sure
you want to have fun tonight dont you
theyll be fine
he kisses wifes face and exits the bathroom
she covers the wet spot with more cake makeup
the children turn to face him
you guys are going to stay here and watch tv
the children look at each other
i want you to be in bed asleep before twelve
your mother and i will be back later on
wife goes straight for the door
he blows one kiss
one for both of them
as man and his wife walk out the door man turns back to the children
he closes the door
sarah stands in the middle of the room
shes looking at the door man and wife just disappeared through
her dress looks frilly and beautifully uncomfortable
she touches the edges of the fabric
why did we have to get all dressed up if we werent going with them
man and wife are walking down the hall
man stops in his tracks
wife stops too and looks at man
juancho shuts off the television
he drops the remote to the floor
his attention is on the fireworks outside
he leaps to the window and begins unlatching it
what are you doing
stinks in here anyway
man bursts through the door of the hotel room and stands in the doorway glaring at the mischievous juancho
juancho bangs his head on the window trying to get back inside
he leaps to the floor and tries to turn on the tv with the remote
stern what did i say
juancho turns to man as if hed been sitting there watching television the whole time
ted appears at the door with mans champagne
the champagne you ordered sir
no time for this
leave it on ice
ted proceeds to place the champagne in the room
but i want some now
ted is torn
man pushes him into the room
therell be plenty for you and the party baby you can bomb yourself all you want at the party
what a waste
ted places the bucket near the bed
after setting up the bottle he turns to leave but now man closes the door trapping ted inside with them
to ted hey
ted looks around bewildered
man is reaching into his coat pocket
you want five hundred bucks
man hesitates a moment then pulls out his wallet
that was too easy
how about three
my children are staying here tonight watching tv
i want you to check up on them every thirty minutes
check up on em
make sure theyre all right make sure theyre fed make sure they go to bed
we can call out and hire a babysitter
i dont trust babysitters
my children are safer alone than with some fucked up pedophile babysitter i dont know from the man in the fucking moon
what about him
what makes you think you can trust him
man grabs teds face and tilts it torward wife
tell me thats not a face you can trust
man lets go of teds face
he feels his jaw
its still there
look sir id like to help you out but i really cant
im all alone here tonight
man whips out his wallet and counts out money in teds face
i thought you said five hundred
man glares at ted
i said three hundred
ted doesnt back down
no you distinctly said five hundred
the angrier man gets the quieter he talks
you calling me a liar
ted while not backing down massages the situation
no im not saying youre lying
im saying you accidentally forgot that what you first said was five hundred
man has never been challenged like this by a fuckin bellboy
i dont do anything accidentally jerk
i mightve first said five hundred but what i last said was three hundred and what you say last is what counts
ted not only doesnt back down but psychologically pokes his finger in the scary mans chest
well then if you say five hundred one last time we got a deal
mans eyes narrow
he physically pokes his finger in teds chest
you fuckin with me pendejo
now ted takes a step backwards
no not at all
its new years eve and im here alone
if there was somebody else here no problem but im by myself
and looking after your kids is a pain in the ass i dont need you callin my kids a pain in the ass
no theyre not a pain in the ass its the situation thats a pain in the ass
man drops the tenseness
no you were right the first time
you win tough guy five hundred
man respects ted for not backing down but not insulting him either
a skill man never learned
wife shoots a look at the children
disgusted you kids are getting expensive
juancho turns back to the tv
sarah stares down wife
looking at name tag whats your name
close up of name tag
man tears off teds name tag and throws it to children
to the children his name is ted
if you need anything dial and ask for ted
sarah catches the name tag and reads the name on it ted sarah looks up at ted
she clips the pin to her dress and smiles shyly at him
man puts the money in teds pocket and then grabs his ear pulling him close
deadly whisper if something happens to my children i wouldnt want to be you
make sure theyre in bed before midnight
thinking before midnight
then should i wake them up for the countdown to the new year
wife looks disgusted
as man and wife exit he turns to the kids and says dont misbehave
man closes the door
man and wife book it down the hall before ted can change his mind
ted is standing facing the door the man and wife just disappeared through
he turns around slowly to face the children
his eyes are wide
his face is quiet
the children are staring at him
these are the rules
dont break the rules and i wont break your necks
the kids look at each other
smiling i always wanted to say that
someone said that to me when i was a kid
sarah laughs at his joke
except they were joking
ted goes to the door
the rules are simple
dont do anything you wouldnt do if your parents were here
if theres an emergency call me on the phone like your dad said
thats not what he said
teds surprised by a challenge this early in the game
he said to call if we need anything
well ive got a lot of work to do and i cant have you calling me every time you want a drink of water so please limit your calls to
we paid you five hundred dollars
well call you if we need anything
you dont want to upset my dad
try to call only when necessary
watch tv and if youre good ill bring up some milk and cookies
ted walks briskly down the hall counting his money the whole way
juancho takes off his socks and shoes and throws them onto the floor
sarah looks at the discarded shoes and socks
close on the shoes and socks
sarah looks over at juanchos bare feet
her nose twitches
your feet stink
juancho smells his feet
they dont stink
sarah throws his shoes and socks behind her
they land on the bed
juancho is flipping channels and finds an interesting show
check it out
sarah realizes he found a nudie station
youre not supposed to watch this
were supposed to watch tv
not this kind of tv
juancho rolls up in a ball the remote tucked in some recess of his stomach
sarah hits him then goes to the phone
she punches sits on the bed and checks the name on the name tag pinned to her shirt
ted walks up to the front desk just as the phone rings
sarah is taking off her white winter tights
its me sarah
youre our sitter for tonight
oh jesus what did i tell you
i said if you dont bother me youll get milk and cookies
now do you want them or do you not
i want you to turn off the nudie station in our room
ted checks the computer
reading stats on room i cant turn on an adult station without permission from your parents
struggling with winter tights not turn it on turn it off
its already on
thats not what the machine tells me
well stop listening to the machine and listen to me
theres naked ladies dancing on my tv and i want em off
if youre good youll get milk and cookies so leave me alone please
ill be up later to put you both to sleep
he hangs up
angry sarah slams down the phone
she has an unusually adult temper
we know where she gets it from
she looks up and sees that the nudies are still in full force
change the channel now
juancho turns around
he has a face like someone just laid a fart in his nose
man youre the one with the stinky feet
sarah smells her feet
they dont stink
yeah they do
here smell for yourself
she sticks her foot out for juancho to smell
he slowly very slowly
climbs onto the bed and lowers his head to her foot
sarah waits until hes close enough to her foot before she kicks him in the face sending him somersaulting off the bed and crashing to the floor
she grabs the remote control he left behind and changes the channel to a cartoon
juancho gets up and realizes his defeat
he decides to wander about
looking for something to do
sarah tries to ignore him as he stalks the room
its only a matter of time before he finds mischief
juancho sees the champagne bucket and bingo
he goes for the bottle
holding up the bottle hey get a bottle opener
sarah opens her mouth as if about to tell him to leave the champagne alone
she stops herself when she realizes she wants some champagne too
she quickly scrambles about for a bottle opener while juancho unwraps the bottle top
sarah opens the dresser drawer with such force that a few hidden contents long forgotten in the back of the drawer slide forward
some coins a paperclip and a hypodermic needle
she looks down at the needle that lays beside the gideon bible and casually picks the phone back up and punches
the phone rings
ted bucket of ice in his hand gets ready to go to room
as he crosses the desk the phone rings
he looks at the board and see room s light blinking
he sighs in exasperation
sarah sees juancho shaking the champagne bottle violently
dont shake it
into phone ted
then dont call me
i thought id tell you that your cleaning ladies are doing a bum job
theres all kinds of leftover stuff around here
sarah picks up the needle and rolls it over in her hand several times
needles and things
were not supposed to have needles here are we
i mean they dont come with the room do they
send someone up here to clean this place up right
the champagne bottle explodes all over juancho
he looks surprised
to juancho to ted i gotta go
my brother just exploded the champagne all over the room
oh and bring us a couple of toothbrushes
theres a card in the bathroom that says youll bring free toothbrushes if we ask for them
she hangs up
a frustrated ted hangs up the phone
he walks briskly to the elevator
sarah and juancho are pouring themselves champagne
they turn up the television and drink
juancho shudders at the taste but tries to drink as much as sarah
sarah clearly doesnt like it but tries to pretend she does
sarah picks up an instruction card near the phone to see how to make room to room calls
im calling another room give me three numbers
sarah punches in the room number
the phone rings
she holds the needle up to the light to examine it
you dont know me and i dont know you but
do you have any needles
weve got needles here and i was wondering if they come with the room or not
dont have any
she hangs up
juancho puts down his champagne glass and searches his fathers coat pocket
he finds a pack of cigarettes and takes one out
he puts it in his mouth and pretends to smoke
sarah checks out the hypodermic needle carefully
she has an idea
in the bathroom sarah seeks out her mothers lipstick
sarah stands atop the chest of drawers and uses the lipstick to draw a bulls eye on one of the hotel art paintings
she writes numbers next to each circle representing points
juancho is standing at the foot of the bed cigarette hanging out of his mouth as he practices his dart throwing technique
pointing out the rules the center is the bulls eye points this ones points this ones points
the needle lands an inch from her face in the point slot
hey wait a minute
let me get out of the way
sarah a little tipsy now grabs the needle and staggers to the bed
she hears the key in the doorway and throws the needle into the curtain to hide it
ted enters the room somewhat disheveled from his encounter with sigfried
he has a tray and a new bottle of champagne
he puts the champagne bottle into the empty bucket
he spots the original bottle lying on the floor half empty and dripping into the carpet
i brought you some milk and cookies
if you want some you have to eat them now because youre going to sleep
were going to sleep now
your parents said put you to bed before midnight
well its before midnight
maybe that way youll leave me alone
those arent milk and cookies
we were out of cookies so i brought you milk and saltines
now hurry up and eat
youre going to bed right now
juancho bites into a saltine
sarah simply examines one
these are old
impatient dip em in the milk
the milk will make them soft
sarah gives up and throws the cracker back onto the tray
shes a little drunk
ted picks up the ruined champagne bottle
juancho dips his crackers and eats them
he makes a face and drops a soggy cracker onto the tray
now i dont want you guys wandering around so if you need to go to the restroom go now
they go to the bathroom
ted sits on the bed
he sees the painting on the wall but cant figure out whats different about it
the red lipstick blends right into the aesthetic value of the painting
ted smells something funny
he looks down and sees the socks on the bed
he grabs a fork from the tray and uses it to throw the socks across the room
the kids come back out
what about our pajamas
you wanna look nice in case theres an earthquake dontcha
the children nod
then stay in those clothes
the kids lie on the bed
sarah notices a jar of mentholatum ointment on the dinner tray
oh this is just some mentholatum ointment
come on under the covers
close your eyes and ill tell you a story
the children close their eyes
ted opens the jar of the ointment and sniffs it
strong stuff by the look on his face
your dad says he doesnt trust babysitters
i dont blame him
you know what my babysitter did to me once
confiding i never told my parents either
the children lie in the bed eyes closed listening intently
ted dips his fingers in the jar of vaporous ointment
i hated going to sleep
you know its nighttime and you wanna run around and act crazy
so what my babysitter did to make sure id go to sleep and not be tempted to get up was shed take some of this vapor rub stuff
can you smell this
eyes closed the kids inhale
they smell the ointment and nod yes
well shed just dab a little of this over each eyelid so that i would be sure and keep my eyes closed all night
ted is spreading the ointment over their eyelids as he says this
now youve got some too
dont open your eyes or itll burrrn burn burn
the smell helps clear your sinuses too so its doing double duty
what happens when its morning
if you keep your eyes closed all night it will wear off by morning
but dont open your eyes before did you ever open your eyes
extreme close up on teds eyes
the children are quiet
and now look at me
in unison we cant
youll do just fine
sleep well and i wont tell your parents about the champagne
after a moment of darkness the night is disturbed by the loud crashing of fireworks outside the window
sarah sits up eyes closed
her face feels the warmth coming from the window and she tilts her head toward it
the light of the fireworks dances its reflections off her face
she inhales deeply
then makes a sour face
she goes for the bathroom arms outstretched like a blind girl
she gets to the bathroom turns on the light and searches for the sink
she begins to wash the ointment off her eyes very carefully
she dries her eyes thoroughly and opens them
checks them in the mirror
a little red but otherwise fine
she goes back into the bedroom turns on the television and grabs the new champagne bottle
she shakes it violently
he turns his head to her
his eyes are still closed
are you watching tv
the champagne bottle explodes
she pours herself a glass
if you wanna watch too you have to go wash your face
juancho gets up smiling and tries to run to the bathroom
he slams into the wall hard
juancho walks into the bathroom a little slower more cautious
sarah pours herself another glass
she downs the glass and shudders
she smells the bad smell again
only now she really smells it
she smells her feet
she smells the champagne
juancho enters the room and sits on the bed
sarah grabs his foot and smells it
she drops his foot
juancho stares blankly at her
sarah looks down at the mattress
she smells the mattress
juancho looks at her as if shes drunk
sarah leaps off the bed and turns on the room lights
she takes a huge swig from the champagne bottle then stalks toward the mattress
juancho leaps off the bed as well and stands back
sarah pulls the mattress off of the bedsprings enough to see what is underneath it
sarah is too stunned to scream
stuffed into the bedsprings is a womans dead and beaten corpse
teds phone ringing
ted looks at the phone as if pondering whether or not to answer it
he taps his fingers
finally he answers the phone
what do you want now for christs sake
near tears i dont know but shes in my bed
theres a dead body in my bed
thats just your brother
no theres a womans dead body inside the bed in the mattress
you saw the body
youve got ointment on your eyes
you cant see shit
now go to sleep
ted hangs up the phone
godammit go to sleep
crying now i washed it off
you washed off the ointment
pissed drunk yeah didnt you ever think to do that
ted is quiet on the line
juancho lights up a cigarette for real and takes nervous puffs
sarah carries the phone over to juancho and snatches the cigarette away from him
she stuffs it in her own mouth and nervously takes a long drag on it
through cigarette you never tried it did you
then you agree im smarter than you
now you listen to me
get your ass up here and call the police because theres a dead body in my bed and it smells like shit and it looks even worse and if you
dont help us my dad is gonna lay you down right next to her i swear to fucking god
she drinks from her champagne bottle
shes pulling the mattress back over the corpse again
shes drunk all right
incensed im coming up and if there isnt a dead body by the time i get there ill make one myself
ted slams down the phone
as he walks away from the counter he spots the childrens parents driving up to the valet out front
ted breaks into a sprint and dives into a closing elevator
sarah continues to cover the body with the mattress
close on teds face as the elevator car races up seven floors
the man is carrying his drunk wife through the lobby
ted bursts into the room
he sees the disarray
ted pushes the champagne out of sarahs hand spilling it onto the floor
what the fuck is going on
he sees juancho with the cigarette hanging out of his mouth and rips it away from him
the butt goes flying onto the carpet near the spreading champagne spill
your parents are on their way up and im not taking responsibility for this mess
check under the mattress
crying for the body cant you smell it
its your feet
sarah grabs the mattress and pulls it off herself
ted sees the rotting corpse
vomit spews out of teds mouth
gurgles through vomit spewing lips jesus fucking christ
what the fuck is this
he tears at the phone
into the phone police its an emergency
pause hello police this is the mon signor hotel get someone up here right fucking now theres a dead whore stuffed under the mattress
tears well in sarahs eyes as she looks at the body
dont call her that
into the phone im dead fucking serious theres a dead fucking whore stuffed in the bedsprings of the fucking bed
stop calling her that
sarah grabs the hypodermic needle from under the curtain and stabs it into teds leg
sarah steps back almost tripping over the champagne bottle
she picks up the bottle and holds it defensively in case ted tries to retaliate
ted spins around now noticing the needle sticking out of his leg
juancho lights up another cigarette
the champagne spill has spread to the fallen cigarette butt
the carpet bursts into flames around the spill
close on a key going into the keyhole outside
ted tries to pull the syringe out of his leg but yanking it makes it break in two the plunger in his hand and the needle still stuck in his
ted staggers and grabs hold of the dead womans foot for support as he steps on the remote control flipping the tv on to the nudie channel just as
man opens the door
man stands at the door drunk wife unconscious on one arm the door knob in the other hand
hes looking mean
mans pov focused on the dead woman in the bedsprings
we pan up the dead womans leg to find ted holding her foot
we pan down teds leg to find the hypodermic needle jutting out
then pan over to the other hand holding the broken syringe plunger
we pan over to the nudie channel then down to the fire blazing behind the children
pan up to the dripping champagne bottle in sarahs hand then over to the cigarette hanging out of juanchos mouth
juancho tosses his cigarette out of his mouth to an area behind him
another blaze starts immediately
man drops his wife to the floor
in the wide shot of ted and the children we see that the fireworks are bursting big and bright outside the window behind them
almost as bright as the flames eating through the room
man simply glares at ted
finally man speaks
did they misbehave
ted stares blankly at man the camera as the sprinklers burst on
drenching the room as the picture the elevator rides down to the lobby
the doors open and a wet disheveled and frantic ted steps out
he staggers across the lobby to the reception desk
he grabs the phone
the wild new years eve party is winding down
some guests are passed out some are asleep some are making out two guys are playing nintendo a girl watches them
the phone rings
the girl who wears a guinness stout t shirt answers the phone
happy new year

awww how come
well betty the chick whose house youre at even though you dont know her leaves me here all by myself on new years eve
and first thing right off the bat im fucked by a coven of witches
an oven full of witches fucked you
is that like at the circus when they stick all those clowns in an itty bitty car
a coven of witches
well one witch in particular
was she an old hag with a mole with hair growing out of it
no no no she was
margaret thinks for a moment
whats the problem
well admittedly that was the best part of the night
it was pretty fuckin cool actually
but it was still an unnerving way to start off the night
sounds to me like a pretty great way to start off the night
okay lets just skip over the witches
skipping over the witches
so later in another room some crazy sucking maniac sticks a gun in my face and forces me to play out some psychosexual drama with his wife
he made you have psycho sex with his wife
no he didnt make me fuck his wife he thought id fucked his wife
he held me at gunpoint with a loaded gun
what kinda gun
i dont know im not a gun guy
it was big
like dirty harrys gun
yeah something like that
did it have a real long barrel or a short barrel
what difference does it make
well for one thing its the difference between a
magnum and a magnum
who cares if it was a
it was a fuckin loaded gun pointed at my fuckin head
margaret takes this in
you wanna skip over this part too
i want you to get betty on the phone
yelling to the room anybody live here named
to ted whats her name again
the sleepy room stirs
betty wakes up from the floor
yeah whatcha screamin about
yeah im betty its my fuckin place who the fuck are you
im margaret hands her the phone and this is ted
betty takes the phone
ted whats the problem
whats the problem
i dont got a problem i got fuckin problems
yawning wiping sleep from her eyes sure
well most recently theres room
theres a scary mexican gangster dude pokin his finger in my chest
theres his hooligan kids snapping their fingers at me
theres the putrid rotting corpse of a dead whore stuffed in the springs of a bed
therere rooms blazing afire
theres a needle from god knows where stuck in my leg infecting me with god knows what and finally theres me walking out the fuckin door right now
a ringing sound happens that we havent heard before
teds head turns toward it
its the guest board
and the top light the penthouse is ringing
it rings where all the others buzzed
betty can hear it distinctly on her side of the line
the sound fully wakes her up
they start talking howard hawks style again
suddenly alert is that the penthouse
thats the chester rush party they want something
yeah well tough titty
theyre just gonna have to wait cause im out the door
panicking now ted wait a minute
i know youre freaked i know youre stressed
youve had a real bad night yes betty ive had a real bad night you say theres a dead body in a room
yes i did
no problem this is a hotel weve had dead bodies before its just the price of doing business
you said the hotel was on fire
is it still on fire
no its out
good sprinkler system worked like a charm
now you wanna leave youve had enough
ill take care of everything else
the only thing i ask is that you take care of chester rush
then you can leave
now look ted hes a very important guest of this hotel
in fact he is the most important guest at the hotel
the mon signor used to be a haven for movie stars
through the thirties and forties and the first half of the fifties more movie stars if you break it down on a night by night basis stayed at the mon
signor than any other hotel in hollywood
now we had some hard time in the eighties even though we were the official hotel of cannon pictures but were coming back strong in the nineties
and a movie star clientele is important to that comeback
if we can keep stars of his magnitude happy were on our way
so ted just take care of him then you can leave
look i dont feel like he probably just wants some champagne
you can do that cant you
please just take care of him the entire staff of the mon signor is begging you
but get your ass here pronto
youre a good man ted
ted hangs up the phone
and picks up the board phone
sorry for the delay
how can i help you
the elevator door opens and ted wheels out his tray into the hallway
theres been a bit of an effort to make himself appear a bit less disheveled than in the last scene
hes only minorly successful in the attempt
his uniform still looks like shit his hair looks tousled and he walks with a limp
he wheels the cart up to the penthouse door and knocks at the door
a woman opens the door its angela from alexs story
what the hell are you doing here
she holds up the drink she has in her hand
having a drink
is that crazy husband of yours in there
are you kidding hell be asleep till christmas
from behind her we hear entrez entrez
angela steps aside and ted wheels in the tray
the penthouse is huge far and away the best suite in the house
and standing in the middle of the biggest room in the hotel is the hottest newest comedy star to burst onto the hollywood scene in nearly a decade chester rush
at this moment in time hes the king and he has the swagger of a new king
after only one movie hes pulled the sword out of the stone
and the look on his face says kings good
surrounding him is his entourage
they all look like once upon a time this evening they were dressed sharp however at this late hour everybody looks about as disheveled as ted
one of the lads norman has planted roots in a comfy chair with his leg thrown over the arm and a bottle of jim beam in his hand
the second guy leo is in the back of the room pacing back and forth on the telephone
he is completely oblivious to the rest of the rooms activity
in chesters hand is an ever present glass of champagne which he constantly spills as he gestures wildly
around the room are the leftovers pizza boxes fast food hamburgers and empty bottles of cristal champagne
still sitting entrez entrez come in come in
wheeling in the tray hi sorry i took so long but i got everything you asked for not a problem my friend mr
closing the door his names theodore
actually its not theodore he throws a look at angela its ted
chester rises from the couch
so ted the bellboy as i was saying would you care for some champagne
thats not what i was saying but would you care for some champagne
no thank you
its the best
i never liked champagne before i had cristal now i love it
okay yeah sure
as chester goes and pours ted a glass as i was saying ted dont worry about being late
for our purposes promptness is far behind thoroughness
on thoroughness he hands ted the glass
they clink glasses and drink
whadya say ted
no not thank you
whadya say about the tasty beverage
fuckin good ted
its fuckin good
lets try it again shall we
so ted whadya think about the beverage
its fuckin good
you bet your sweet bippy ted
its fuckin cristal everything else is piss
norman in the chair starts yelling at ted
ted knows hes being laughed at but not why
to norman knock it off youre making my friend ted here uneasy
to ted pay no attention to norman here ted hes just fuckin wit ya thats all
thats from quadrophenia
now me myself when i think of bellboys i think of bellboy isnt an insult is it
is there another name for what you do that im ignorant of
bellman bellperson bellboys fine
im glad they havent changed that
theres a friendliness to bellboy
as i was saying ted when norman thinks of bellboys he thinks of quadrophenia
but me when i think of bellboys i think of the bellboy with jerry lewis
didja ever see the bellboy
you should its one of jerrys better movies
he never says a word through the entire film
a completely silent performance
how many actors can pull that off
and he has to go to france to get respect
that says it all about america right there
the minute jerry lewis dies every paper in this fuckin country gonna write articles calling the man a genius
its not right
its not right and its not fair
but why should that surprise anybody
when has america ever been fair
we might be right every once in a while but were very rarely fair
where do you want this
you in a hurry ted
he is but doesnt want to rush the movie star no not particularly
good then stop playing beat the clock
now let me introduce you to everybody
he puts his arm around ted and leads him around the room
angela crosses frame drink in hand
our friend from downstairs you already seem to be acquainted with
as she snuggles up in a big comfy chair oh me and theodore go way back
dont we theodore
the names ted angela
i only let people with loaded guns at my head call me theodore
angelas like you ted a newfound friend
we met at the pool
to ted have you ever seen angela in a one piece
well its somethin to see
arm around ted the man sitting in the chair with the bottle of jim bean in his hand and the sense of humor is norman
norman say hello to ted
norman shakes his hand
the sociable son of a bitch on the telephone is leo
and the person on the other end of the phone is his lovely wife ellen
to leo leo say hello to ted
leo breaks away from his phone conversation for two seconds
hi ted glad you could make it
back to phone what
pause what does punctuality have to do with love
which brings me to me chester rush ted
pleased to meetcha
chester shakes teds hand
im sorry i havent seen your movie
ted wonders if he should have said that
chester walks over to the table and pours himself some more champagne
when he talks now its slower and somewhat distracted
the tone of the scene starts changing
its quite all right ted nothing to feel sorry about
thats why god invented video
but you know ted a lot of people did see it
chester takes a drink of champagne a disgusted look crosses his face and he slowly puts it down
his manner gives the room a chill
when he talks he addresses the room
who drank out of this bottle last
chester walks over to ted and fills his glass
who drank out of this bottle not the other bottles this bottle last
whats wrong chester
he spills the champagne from his glass onto the floor
its fuckin flat norman thats whats wrong
the champagne the fuckin cristals fuckin flat
chester improvises a temper tantrum about the flat cristal
everyone looks at him not knowing what to say
even leo walks over to witness
the whole room is uneasy and a little frightened
when chester finishes his tantrum he turns his attention back to ted
as he talks to him he opens up another bottle
but its not the rapid pace delivery chester has done so far
its more troubled and distracted
i was saying ted a lot of people did see it
and not just on video either
leo what was the final take on domestic
leo is still in the doorway making sure his boys cool
worried tone you okay champ
struggling with bottle im cool so talk to your wife
leo turns his attention back to the phone and goes inside the room
thats before video and before foreign and before pay tv and before free tv
were talking fuckin asses in fuckin seats
he pops the cork before all that other shit the wacky detective made
chester walks over to ted and fills his glass
and my new one the dog catcher its projected to break a hundred
he clinks teds glass with his the dog catcher
the dog catcher
they both drink
the tantrums over and chesters back to his fast talking good natured self
now lets stroll over here and see what goodies you brought us
do you mind me asking whats all this stuff for
one thing at a time ted
im not a frog and youre not a bunny so lets not jump ahead
cmon norman you should be interested in this
pause tell it
ted produces the things they called for
a block of wood
chester knocks on it
why three nails
thats how many peter lorre asked for
ted is completely bewildered
a roll of twine
thats definitely a roll of twine
a bucket of ice
to norman you into it
to chester im into it
to ted go on
chester takes it and eats it
thats for me
and a hatchet
a hatchet as sharp as the devil himself is what i asked for
well you be the judge
ted holds the hatchet out for chester to take
norman snatches it instead
ill be the judge
norman touches the end of the blade with his thumb
thats a sharp motherfucker
bring all this bullshit over to the bar
you heard him ted
ted is completely confused and starting to get a little scared but he does what hes told
leo slams down the phone
you still married
maybe maybe not but i dont give a flyin fuck either way
ive had it with that machiavellian bitch
im too drunk to drive home
im sorry about that im real sorry about that
i got drunk on new years eve cut my fuckin head off
noticing ted at the bar whats going on here
we now return you to the man from rio already in progress
surprised noooo youre gonna do it
you guys aint bullshittin youre gonna really go for it
angela is still curled up
after talkin about it all night they better
i wanna see a show
when we do it youll have something to see
leo walks up to norman and throws his arm around him
you are one radical dude
ted doesnt know what anybodys talking about which is just fine with him
he finishes laying out everything on the bar and says well thats everything so if you dont need me for anything else ill go back downstairs
not so fast ted
we aint quite done yet
why dont you take a seat at the bar get comfortable and have an open mind when we explain the festivities of the evening to you
look guys you paid for the room
as long as you dont break up the furniture you can do whatever the fuck you want
and me personally i dont care if you break up the furniture
you dont have to explain anything to me
whatever constitutes a good time as far as you guys are concerned is your business
well its your business ted
cause we want you to take part
take part in what
chester your way of breaking the news to him gently is scarin the shit outta him
look at the poor guy
just spit it out
little by little everybody has gathered around ted
first off let me say that theres nothing homosexual about what were going to ask you to do
theres nothing sexual at all about what we want
but i was thinkin you might be thinkin we want you to do some sex thing
pee on us suck us off shit like that
let me assure you nothing could be farther from what we want angela interrupts can i jump in here
no you cant jump in here this is my story
theodores been here fifteen minutes and youve talked about everything but
hey if you dont like it you can get the fuck out
leo taps his champagne glass with a tiny spoon shutting everybody up
if itll please the court let me explain to ted our intentions
yelling i second the nomination
yelling move the nomination be closed
chester takes the hatchet and brings it down on the bar like a hatchet
calmly leo the floor is yours
to ted ted did you ever watch the old alfred hitchcock show
totally bewildered at this point yeah
did you ever see the episode the man from rio with peter lorre and steve mcqueen
i dont think so
oh youd remember it all right
in the show peter lorre makes a bet that steve mcqueen cant light his cigarette lighter ten times in a row
now if steve mcqueen can light his cigarette lighter ten times in a row he wins peter lorres new car
if he cant he loses his little finger
pause norman and chester just made the same bet
pause normans putting up his pinky against chesters mint convertible red convertible chevy corvelle that he can light his zippo ten times in a row
ted looks at all of them taking in the information before saying you guys are drunk
well that goes without saying but that doesnt mean we dont know what were doing
ill tell ya what im doin
norman lays an issue of hot classic cars in front of ted on the bar
on the cover is a picture of chester smiling standing next to a beautiful red convertible chevy corvelle
the headline reads hollywoods hottest new star next to americas hottest old car
i drive a motherfuckin honda my sister sold me
you hear what im sayin
a little white motherfuckin honda civic
he holds up the magazine you see this shit
reading the magazine hollywoods hottest new star next to americas hottest old car
he hands ted the magazine now you take a good look at that machine that this motherfucker over here is standing next to
thats a nigger red rag top chevy corvelle
and i love that car moren i love hips lips and fingertips
cut to we sittin here celebrating gettin high drinkin champagne cristal
when youre drinkin anything else youre drinking champagne
when youre drinkin cristal you say youre drinkin cristal
rockin new years eve
when all of a sudden we flip on steve mcqueen and peter lorre bein fuckin badass
and i look at this funny motherfucker over here and i say id do that for the chevelle
and chester replies
you guys wouldnt be doin something this stupid unless you were drunk
everybody breaks into a here here murmur
i think that pretty much goes without sayin
wed probably chicken out
but when youre fucked up you dont lie
you tell the fuckin truth
and the fuckin truth is my lucky zippos gonna win me chesters car
to chester why are you doing this
thrill of the bet
im the one with something to lose here
cause i can pretty near guarantee that i love my car moren norman loves his pinky
to leo how bout you guys youre just gonna sit back and let your friends mutilate each other
life dont get much more exciting than this
i mean if norman was puttin his dick on the choppin block id step in cause ya know in the morning wed really regret that
but his pinky
who gives a fuck
i mean theoretically he could lose that choppin onions tomorrow
life still goes on
to angela how bout you
to ted i dont care
which brings us to your part in this little wager
i dont have a part
now ted my old granddaddy used ta say the less a man makes declarative statements the less hes apt to look foolish in retrospect
now therere some inherent obstacles in this undertaking
first of all im not some sick fuck like peter lorre on that show travelin the countryside collecting fingers
were all buddies here
nobody wants norman to lose his finger
we just wanna chop it off
so if fate doesnt smile on ol norman well put his finger on ice and rush im to a hospital where in all likelihood be able to sew it back
so normans protected
his interests have been looked after
my interests on the other hand have not
i am as emotionally attached to my car as norman is physically to his finger
im putting up a very expensive piece of machinery on this wager
now if i lose i lose i have no problem with that
im a big boy i knew what i was doing
however if i win i wanna win
if norman lights his lighter ten times in a row hes gonna have no emotional problems about taking my car keys whatsoever
but if i win its not inconceivable that leo or myself at the last minute might not be able to wield the ax
which brings us full circle to you ted
clear eyed ted
we want you to be the diceman
pause as they all look at him
angela breaks it
helluva night huh ted
i gotta get out of here
ted abruptly gets up and makes a beeline for the door
chester whips out a hundred dollar bill and quickly calls to ted from his position at the bar
ted i got a hundred dollar bill here with your name on it whether you do what we ask or not just to sit back down in the chair for
one minute more
ted spins in his direction
im not gonna cut off his finger
maybe you will and maybe you wont but that has nothing to do with this hundred dollar bill in my hand
you can tell us all to go fuck off and walk right out that door
but if you sit back down and wait sixty seconds before you do it youll be a hundred dollars richer
ted just stands across the room thinking
take the money
ted youre gonna do whatever you want to do
were just askin you to indulge us for another minute more
and chesters willin to pay for it
ill take your money and ill sit back down
but a minute from now im gonna walk out the door and when i do therell be no hard feelings
well i want you to have a bit more of an open mind than that but yeah well either convince you or we wont
no hard feelings
ted wearily sits back down
chester positions himself in front of ted at the bar
okay leo you be the timekeeper
let us know when one minute begins and when it ends
you got it
he checks his watch gentlemen start your engines
chester jumps up and down loosening up
chester who talks fast anyway starts his pitch
its chester who now plays beat the clock
okay pay attention here ted i aint got much time
now im gonna make two piles here on the bar
he takes the hundred dollar bill and lays it out on the bar one pile pointing at the hundred dollar bill which is yours
and another pile chester whips out a money roll fat enough to choke a horse to death which could be yours
he lays a matching hundred dollar bill on the bar starting a second pile now what you have to be aware of is were gonna do this bet one way
he lays another hundred on the end pile or the other
he lays another hundred on the pile whether its you who holds the ax he lays another hundred on the pile or the desk clerk downstairs he lays another hundred
on the pile or some bum we yank off the street
he lays another hundred on the pile you can buy a lot of soup with that pile
to norman shhhh im the closer
to the group how much is on the bar already
i lost count
ted do you know how long it takes the average american to count to six hundred
laying another bill on the pile one minute less than it takes to count to seven hundred
you know ted a persons life is made up of a zillion little experiences
he lays another bill on the pile some which have no meaning are insignificant and you forget them
and some that stick with you for the rest of your natural life he lays another bill on the pile barring alzheimers of course
now what were proposing is so unusual so outside the norm that i think it would be a pretty good guess that this will be one of those experiences that
so since youre gonna be stuck remembering this moment for the rest of your life you gotta decide what that memory will be
he lays down the last bill on the pile so are you gonna remember for the next forty years give or take a decade how you refused a thousand dollars
for one seconds worth of work or how you made a thousand dollars for one seconds worth of work
well ted whats it gonna be
ted looks at the pile then looks up
we dolly into his face
we see a quick montage of horrendous moments from all the other stories
back to ted
the group cheers
but when its over no matter what happens i get the money
as long as you do your part you can take the pile walk out the door and not say another word
lets do it right now before i change my mind
everybody gets in their position by the bar
norman lays his left hand on the block of wood with his pinky sticking out
in his right hand is his zippo lighter poised and ready to strike
chester hands ted the meat cleaver
ted takes it raises it up above normans finger in position
perfect perfect perfect perfect
this is great
this is a moment in time none of us will ever forget
everybody is crowded around the scene on pins and needles
norman you ready
ted you ready
norman looks hard at the zippo in his hand
ted holding the cleaver stares focused on normans pinky
norman readies himself
places his thumb on the wheel in the zippo
takes a breath
it sparks but doesnt light
without missing a beat ted brings down the cleaver slicing off normans pinky
norman lets out a scream
ted in one move lays down the cleaver scoops up the money and walks out the door
camera is positioned at far end of hallway looking down it at the elevator at the other end
ted walks out of the penthouse in the f
in a medium shot he takes the thousand dollars in his hand looks at it smiles and sticks it in his pocket
it mightve been a bad night but its been a profitable one
he chuckles at the irony and whistling a happy tune turns his back on the camera and walks down the hall to the elevator
all the while we hear pandemonium breaking out behind the door
as ted walks to the elevator the credits roll
he waits for the elevator it arrives he gets in the doors close
as credits continue to roll we hold for about two beats
the door bursts open and everybody comes piling out
everybodys screaming yelling different things to one another
norman has a bloody towel wrapped around his hand hes screaming and crying
my finger my fucking finger
chester has the bucket of ice with the finger in it
leos trying to direct everything
everybodys in frantic activity except for angela who stands back drinks her drink and watches the show
they all run down the hall toward the elevator
somebody trips and they all hit the ground
the bucket of ice with the finger goes spilling
they run around like crazy looking for the finger and picking up ice cubes
norman lies on the floor and screams
they pick it all up get to the elevator and push the button
when it arrives they all dive in except for angela
you know im gonna call it a night and go back to my room
its been fun
the doors close on the screaming maniacs
angela walks through a door marked stairway
credit roll continues angela comes through the door we steadicam in front of her as she walks the halls looking for her room
she finds it
angela sticks her key in the door then stops when she sees something approaching
the look on her face combines strange awe and mild shock
almost floating ethereally a mysterious blond bombshell wearing dianas see through negligee and slippers armed with elspeths sword slung over her shoulder wanders toward her
she is in a daze perhaps lost or drunk
you okay lady
the bombshell looks up at her dizzily
i said you looking for someone
have you seen him
angela and the girl have a strange moment as they connect through the eyes
having had enough emotional intensity tonight angela breaks their eye contact
lady i havent seen anybody
diana quietly says ohhh as she drifts on down the hall in a daze
angela puts her hand to her temples before opening her hotel door
she does a double take on the hallway empty
she pauses a beat then walks into her room
after the door closes we hear sigfried on the other side
where the hell have you been
