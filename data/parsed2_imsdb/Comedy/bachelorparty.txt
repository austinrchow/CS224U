screenplay by neal israel pat proft story by bob israel camera pans a group of freshly scrubbed innocent children obediently standing in line like recruits for the holy crusade
pull back to reveal they are wearing the gray blazers striped ties and navy slacks of st
they are waiting patiently at the curbside in front of the statue of the schools sainted namesake
one of the fifth grade boys pokes the kid next to him with his elbow
the other kid is about to retaliate when sister mary francis a stern faced nun appears behind them grabbing them both firmly by the shoulders
make one more move and youll both be staying late for the rest of the week
softly in unison sorry sister mary francis
i didnt hear you
louder sorry sister mary francis
sister mary francis checks her watch
she scowls and looks out past the parking lot gate
suddenly we hear the sound of an engine roaring at full throttle
there is a screeching of brakes followed by the loud grinding of gears
it sounds like the indy is taking place around the corner
used to this step away from the curb children
zooming through the parking lot gates is a large yellow school bus
it practically takes the last turn on just two wheels
the bus driver quickly slams on the brakes leaving ten feet of rubber behind him as the bus comes to an ear splitting halt right in front of them
the front door immediately swings open and rick stahl the driver hops out
rick is the life of the party even when there isnt any party going on
while chronologically older than the st
luke students the only thing that sets him apart from them is that he has a drivers license
rick figures hell live up to his capabilities and get serious in his next life
this incarnations strictly for laughs
sister mary francis steps up to him
youre late again rick
i know sister but i have a very good excuse
there can be no excuse for tardiness
youre absolutely right
i should never have stopped to save that drowning infant
im just weak sister im so weak
he starts sobbing softly into his hands
all right stop that
children on the bus
the kids obediently file past rick who makes like he is drying his tears with his handkerchief
sister do you ever get lonely after vespers
if you do why dont you give me a call
im in the book
smiling despite herself get going rick
youre late enough as it is
think it over
he hops on the bus closes the door and gently backs the bus out of the parking lot
as soon as the bus is out of sight of the school all hell breaks loose
the formally well mannered children are acting like normal kids
hitting each other over the heads with books running up and down the aisles screaming at the top of their lungs
he removes the st
christopher statue from the dashboard revealing a hulaing hawaiian girl in a grass skirt
he watches the madness behind him in his rearview mirror picks up the p
microphone and rationally attempts to restore order
over mike if you dont all calm down im gonna drive this thing over a cliff
the kids pay no attention to him
continuing philosophically ah
ricks bus pulls up to a light and another school bus filled with kids from a public school pulls up alongside of it
the other driver gives rick a competitive smirk and guns his engine
rick counters by gunning his
all the kids start screaming race
wipe em out
go for it
some of the kids even start taking out money and start betting one another on the races outcome
as he readies for action
the light turns green and theyre off
or as off as two lunky school buses filled with kids can be
the two buses come zooming down the street
the kids are screaming at rick to go faster
one of the little boys looks nauseous as he clutches the seat in front of him
the buses squeeze down a narrow street neck and neck with one another
the kids are all yelling words of encouragement to rick who is hunched over in his seat driving with the determination of andy granitelli
the nauseous kid is now turning a pale shade of green
he moves to an open window straining to control the inevitable
they race down a steep hill
the nauseous kid cant hold it any longer
something hits with a splat against the windshield that resembles campbells chunky vegetable soup
the other driver turns on the windshield
it only makes it worse
ricks bus pulls out in front accompanied by the cheering of his passengers
suddenly a stop light looms ahead
rick puts on his brakes
both buses stop just in time
ricks kids are all piled in a clump right behind him in the front of the bus
although disheveled the kids still manage a victorious cheer
were looking through the camera lens
we see a cute one year old baby boy
hes sitting on a cuddly blanket
we hear the voice of jay oneill
he is a baby photographer at sears
hold that smile
and watch the birdie
he takes the picture and we see the camera flash
we see he has his camera and backdrop set up in the camera department behind a velour curtain which blacks out the rest of the store
hes conservatively dressed in a suit vest and tie
he looks like he could be a young republican
but under those sears clothes is a man a little off center
ricks best friend
need we say more
he takes the film out of the camera
the matronly mother is in the process of gathering up her baby
these should be in the mail to you by next friday
she smiles and exits
a beautiful and were talking gorgeous woman enters
her clothes hug every curve of her body
she has her baby in her arms
oneill immediately wants her and now
his eyes settle onto her full breasts
these he likes
look at those babies
she gets this innuendo and loves it
continuing how are we doing
my name is oneill
and you are
then there is a god
why dont we take that baby picture
he takes the baby
he has a hard time taking his eyes off her breasts
he places the baby on the blanket
continuing if i were you id breast feed until i was or
gets behind camera sizing up the shot tell ya what
we see the baby sitting on the blanket
why dont you lean into the picture with your child
she coyly leans into frame
continuing a huh
a little more
she is totally blocking her baby out of the picture
he gets out from behind the camera
im getting one heck of a glare off your dress there
could you undo a few buttons
seductively of course
she starts to unbutton her blouse
oneill looks into his camera
we see the woman finish her last button
now lean in a little more
as she complies her breasts all but spill out of her dress
continuing hold that pose
he runs from behind the camera and poses with the woman
we see a quick series of camera flashes
each pose finds him near her breasts
he has them on his head
hes cheek to breast
enters and witnesses the photo session
he immediately jumps into the shots
rick joins the craziness
after several beats the woman gets bored and exits the frame
as rick and oneill continue mugging like two year olds in a photo booth the woman takes her child and exits
a few beats pass and the guys notice theyre alone
whered she go
she probably had sex scheduled for
oneill lets pick up the guys for a drink
i have major news to announce
oneill crosses to his camera and takes out the film
be right with ya
he picks up some photographs of todays work
each one has a different mother in several seductive poses
their babies are barely visible if at all
pictures a family will cherish forever
ricks school bus pulls into the yard of the auto shop
several chicanos are working on various cars
rick and oneill hop out
hey chulo where are you man
we see a very large pair of shoes sticking out from under the chassis
slowly a large bear like body rolls out and we catch our first glimpse of chulo
a happy go lucky mechanic of mexican ancestry
hey you guys whats going on
were going for a little liquid refreshment
ill go with you
wait a second
move that car will you
a small mechanic with an eye patch gets into a car behind them as we dolly with the guys through the lot
continuing roberto you finished fixing that lighter yet
another mechanic sticks his face out of another car and shakes his head
just then raul the eye patched worker whizzes by behind the guys driving the car in a zig zag pattern right into traffic
continuing to rick im glad you guys came by
whats the occasion
ricks got an important announcement to make
what is it
ive decided not to run for president
too bad man that blows my chance to be ambassador to france
behind them we can see roberto fiddling with the lighter
suddenly flames leap out of the car blowing roberto ten feet into the air
the guys all start to pile into the bus
nearby another employee is washing down the garage with a hose
chulo turns to another mechanic who has his head under the hood of a car
manuel be sure and finish up the electrical system on that chevy
manuel waves at chulo who turns hops on the bus
rick starts it up and starts to drive away
just as the bus clears frame we see manuel connect two wires together at the same moment the guy with the hose washes down the area around his feet
manuel lights up like a christmas tree screaming in pain
there is a beat and then robert falls into frame still holding the cigarette lighter and the car raul is driving enters the lot and smashes into the side of
a sign on an office door says concert ticket agency
from inside we hear someone talking loudly on the phone
chulo rick and oneill open the door and go inside
on the walls in the cramped office there are rock n roll concert posters advertising rock bands like men at work the clash and barry manilow
behind a cluttered desk we find a little man with a thin mustache and horn rimmed glasses
this is gary melnitz wheeler dealer entrepreneur and coward
gary yells a lot which is a definite overcompensation for his size and inability to deal with the opposite sex
yelling into phone screw you
dont jerk me around
you promised me seats for the police concert
screw you screw sting
hangs up and sees the guys standing there hi guys
gary youre quite an animal
the phone rings
continuing into phone hello concert tickets
pat benitar has a yeast infection

he gets up and they start for the door
just then the phone rings
gary picks it up
annoyed screw you
softly oh mom i didnt know it was you

he hangs up the phone and they start for the door again
isnt he incredible gets along with everybody
yeah hes really got his thing together
oh eat me
the guys all laugh and exit
its a quiet restaurant near a marina
a lot of business people in suits are eating
customer one calls for a waiter
the waiter approaches them from out of frame
wed like to order now
we see their waiter ryko a blond tanned muscular beach bum who has definitely stayed out in the sun too long
how you guys doin

bad day for sailin waves are too rough and
annoyed you can skip the small craft warnings
were in a hurry

he holds up a blackboard with the days menu

one of the customers shrugs and hands him a pen

rick and the guys appear in the bar
they all disappear into the bar area

the customers are pleased to get rid of ryko

chulo gets up and gives rick a big bear hug
the other guys shake his hand

what can i tell you

i love you guys
i always will
lets have a toast
the guys all raise their glasses
to girls with big pairs
yeah right on etc
as they down their drinks we we see a couple of very contemporary looking year olds going into a very now clothing store like fred segals
when the door opens loud rock n roll music blasts out
inside the store we see all the sales clerks grooving narcissistically to the music like theyre at a disco
the cashier phoebe has devoted her life to following the current trends and fads no matter how inane they may be
today shes in a reggae mode her hair wound into tight dreadlocks as she sways lost in the ozone to the music
a customer approaches her with a purchase
id like to pay for these
oh sure wait till this song is over
she floats off again
one of the young male customers approaches an attractive salesgirl
this is debbie thomerson ricks intended
she seems to be the only sane employee in the place because shes actually working putting clothes on the racks
this impression of sanity fits her as she is level headed and has a clear sense of herself
she can also take a joke thus her engagement to rick
excuse me where can i try on these pants
right over here
she leads the customer to the try on booths
the customer enters one
we see that the saloon style doors of the booths have been hung too high so as he takes off his pants his underwear is exposed to the world
we pull back revealing other people in other booths their bare asses clearly in sight
no one in the store seems to care however as they are much too busy dancing
the front door opens and bobbie a very sultry and earthy looking girl with long dark hair pushes inside
she is oneills girl and debbies best friend
shes also someone who would party every night if given half a chance
i dont believe it
im so excited
bobbie what are you talking about
oneill just tole me
its sooo great
i dont believe it
phoebe crosses to them
debbies marrying rick
yes its true
the girls screech and jump around hugging each other in sheer joy
a male customer moved by this outpouring of affection moves over and gets in the middle of the girls enjoying every moment of being hugged by three women at once
to customer realizing would you get out of here
reluctantly the guy retreats back to the calvin klein jeans rack
does cole know about this
really you went with him for two years
he still thinks im going with him
im going to break the news to him tomorrow
hes not gonna be happy
and your parents cant be too thrilled either
as far as theyre concerned the only good rick is a dead rick
but i dont care
its my decision
oblivious im totally blown away
youre getting married
it seems like only yesterday i showed you how to have oral sex
deb i want to throw you a shower
oh thats really sweet
id love that
well invite all the girls
i dont believe it
the girls all start to scream and carry on all over again
rick is cooking dinner in the cramped combination kitchen living room
he has about five dishes going at once as he dashes from stove to refrigerator
he grabs some hamburger meat rolls it into a ball then slaps it on the counter
he then takes a steam iron and presses it on the patty
debbie comes in the front door and crosses to him and hugs him tightly kissing him sweetly
between kisses god youre a slob
but a fabulous cook
what are we having
its either meatloaf swiss steak or charred flesh
i wont know till its finished
looking at the stove i think your dinners burning
rick crosses to the stove
a small fire is coming out of one of the frying pans
he douses it with water
its supposed to do this
setting the table want to hear something great
bobbie and phoebe are throwing me a shower
its really gonna be fun
not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me
youre going to have a bachelor party
im a traditional guy
its a traditional event
he brings all the food to the table well what do you think
it looks awful
yes but looks are deceiving
takes a bite not in this case however
are you going to have women at your party
no sweetheart its a stag party
does stay home
im not talking about does
im talking about hookers
why do you ask
because from what ive heard its a tradition and youre a traditional guy
rick grabs her starts kissing her passionately on the neck
deb you is my woman now
i is yo man
no painted lady ever gonna come between us
i need you to promise
okay you got it
i got a way we can seal the deal whatd you say
he grabs her
they kiss and slide down onto the table knocking the dishes to the floor
through the iron gates of an impressive looking estate comes debbie in her convertible vw rabbit
she pulls up behind a new porsche and a jeep all decked out with rifles nets and other hunting equipment
as she walks down the path toward the house she sees something off in the distance that startles her
a large brown grizzly bear appears to be entering the side door of the house
the bear turns around
we see that the bear is in fact dead
it is being carried by a tall handsome hunter
he waves to debbie and indicates for her to follow him inside
debbie opens a rustic looking door and peers in
over here deb
in the smokehouse
camera pans with debbie as she enters the room
she passes several trophies guns and stuffed animal heads hanging from the wall
she makes her way past some sections of an undetermined animals anatomy hanging from hooks suspended from the ceiling
finally we see cole whittier a steve garvey look alike
rugged all american and heir to the whittier plastic wrap fortune
despite his jockish good looks and outward arrogance theres something in his manner that is definitely unsavory
as debbie approaches him we see that he is butchering some unfortunate friend of the forest on the table in front of him
note for the squeamish all of this is done out of frame
the only thing we should hear are the delightful sounds of taxidermy
just got back from the mountains
as he cuts in with a surgeons skill isnt this a beauty
its gonna look great in the den
debbie tries her best not to look down at what hes doing
cole weve got to talk
finally realized ricks a jerk huh
no cole i
lifting an organ of some sort o
its all right i forgive you
im not the vengeful type
well forget what happened
why dont we take a trip together
maybe kill a few lions in kenya over christmas
cole listen to me
ive got to tell you
you know when you dumped me for that wimp i thought cole shell be back
god wants the two of you to be together and sure enough
cole im marrying rick
confused youre marrying him
then why are you coming back to me
i just thought i should tell you myself before you heard it somewhere else
cole stops what he is doing for a beat and just stares at debbie intensely
then he returns to his work with a renewed enthusiasm chopping slashing and slicing
you know how that makes me feel deb
wanta know how that makes me feel
softly angry deb
a little louder yesss thats the word angry
but if he makes you happy you go right ahead
i want you to be happy deb
a little nuts no matter what no matter how angry it makes me no matter how much it hurts
be happy deb
be oh so very very happy
cole im sorry i
thats all right deb
go be happy and smile a lot deb
do it for me
uncomfortable im going now cole
i understand deb
debbie exits and we push in on cole
something on his face says hi
im really out of my mind
stan is ricks older brother and a proctologist
although hes only in his early thirties he thinks and acts like someone in their early s
a little on the pompous side stan is never without his pipe
okay rick hold out your arm
he crosses to a sterile container and takes out a syringe
you wouldnt hurt your own brother would you
looking at the needle cautiously i changed my mind
i dont need a blood test
the marriage is off
i just then stan sticks the needle in his arm
continuing you always were sneaky stan very sneaky
rick marriage will be good for you
its done wonders for me
true youre a lot handsomer now
dont you have enough blood already
without much conviction you wont miss a thing about being single
the wild parties the different girls every night running around like a maniac
god i miss that
stan youre depressing me
hey i didnt know you were going to fill er up
just take a couple of gallons okay
stan removes the needle and hands rick a cotton ball
continuing thats an even trade
a cotton ball for all my blood
returning to this world okay rick all finished
i cant wait for that bachelor party
i need the action
camera follows them as they go out into the hall
continuing dont say anything to my wife about it
they pass an open examining room
stans wife tina is also a doctor and is examining an old man
shes not as tiny as her name suggests
in face shes more like over sized
rick moves to hug her and he notices that tina has her finger up the old guys ass
looking up rick
to patient mr
goldsmith this is my brother in law
hes getting married
without turning around congratulations
tina turns to a nurse
nurse will you take over
the nurse shrugs and sticks her finger up the patients rear end as tina hugs rick
continuing im so happy for you
rick hugs her uneasily trying to make sure her right hand doesnt come anywhere near his face
debbie and rick and her mom and dad are having a frustrating game of tennis behind her parents plush home
thomerson is a stockily built guy in his fifties who prides himself on being tough and competitive
his wife loves to shop
as far as shes concerned appearances are everything
neither of them likes ricks appearance or anything else about their future son in law
thomerson slams the ball to rick rick slams the ball back and drives it over the fence out of the court
frustrated all right who serves
you do daddy
thomerson serves the ball to debbie who hits it over the net to her mother who hits it to rick who slams it over the fence out of the court
thomerson does not look pleased
rick hit the ball easier son
you dont have to kill it
cant i just maim it a little
perhaps we ought to stop now
lets at least finish the set
rick starts humming the abc wide world of sports theme loudly
gives him a disgusted look and serves the ball
rick smashes the ball and sends it over the fence out of the court
a middle aged couple are sitting on some lawn furniture trying to read the newspaper
a tennis ball comes down from the sky and hits the guy squarely on the top of the head
pull out to reveal that theyre surrounded by dozens of tennis balls
one of these days im gonna burn thomersons court to the ground
rick and mr
thomerson are having a heart to heart chat over some lemonade in front of the tennis court
well i have to admit my games a little rusty but i love polo
its unrelenting a constant challenge to the senses
really a beautiful experience
rick i want to cut through the b
id love that
sitting on his anger good
i think youre an asshole
no let me correct that an immature asshole
which is fine except youre marrying my daughter and im afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes
let me finish
debbies an adult
she can do what she wants
but if you want your marriage to last youre going to have to change some things about yourself
if i may make some suggestions
first youre a slob
you have to dress for success
second your outlook on life
thomerson drones on rick shifts uncomfortably in his chair focusing his attention on debbie her mother and her older cynical cousin ilene who are sitting nearby on the rear patio
im using the same caterer for the shower i had for our christmas party last year
if i were you id worry less about the shower and more about ricks bachelor party
ilene why would i want to do that
i trust rick
of course you do
i trusted my ex mel too
cousin i can only talk from experience
what do you think they do at these parties have tea and play scrabble
ilene rick promised
debbie dont be naive
men are pigs
trying to change the subject girls why dont we go inside for lunch
calling to mr
t boys would you mind bringing in that lemonade
in a second
to rick and youre irresponsible
show some initiative try to better yourself stop showing off actions speak louder than words
well sir thats quite a list
but youre absolutely right
and if i work hard at it i think i can be a totally changed person by the time we finish lunch
thomerson rolls his eyes knowing hes been wasting his breath
he grabs the pitcher of lemonade and rick grabs the tray which is filled with fresh lemons
they get up at the same time and collide sending the lemonade all over mr
and the lemons bounding over the fence
the neighbor we saw before is reading his paper when an avalanche of lemons comes flying at him joining the tennis balls on the lawn
i hate those people
i really do
the thomersons rick debbie and ilene are just finishing lunch
the doorbell rings
thomerson gets up to answer it
standing there is cole wearing his tennis shorts
am i late
not at all
were just finishing lunch
cole crosses to the table and kisses mrs
ts hand gallantly
good to see you mrs
he turns to rick
cole gives him a quick look of contempt and exits with mr
so cole you been practicing your game
why is cole here
you know your father enjoys his company
much the way hitler enjoyed hanging out with mussolini
and cole are having a fast paced game
thank you sir
i know youre as unhappy as i am about debbies marriage to rick
yes sir i am
cole i dont want you to give up on her
ive tried to change her mind
its not her mind you need to change
its disneyland head in there
but how can i do that
if it were me id reason with him first
then if that failed
with malice id take more persuasive action
drills a wicked forehand shot straight at cole who swings at it and misses
conspiratorily thanks for the advise sir
keep me informed
push in on cole
this is a man with a plan
the bluff overlooks the ocean
its a beautiful spot
just the right setting for an outdoor wedding
some folding chairs have been set up and a canvas canopy
gathered for the rehearsal are gary ryko chulo oneill who is with bobbie debbies mother and mr
thomerson phoebe ilene tina stan a gray haired priest
father falwell and of course rick and debbie
everyone is admiring this picturesque setting
everyone but mr
hes very underjoyed at the sight of rick and his friends
thomerson are standing with father falwell
they are watching rick holding debbie
the thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck
you can tell a man by his friends
theyre not such a bad bunch
he points off thats his best man peeing on a tree
in the b
we see oneills back to us
he is definitely relieving himself on a weeping willow
the wind begins to pick up
if everyone would take their positions
everyone takes their places for the wedding procession
the wind now takes this time to blow with much greater force
as father falwell opens his bible the wind rips the pages out of the holy book
they blow to the four corners of the earth
continuing oh dear
well lets begin
he hums the wedding march
chulo hums along
his humming is a driving jimi hendrix like guitar lick that all but drowns out fathers humming
hes orchestrating the proceedings
he gestures for him to start down the aisle good
debbie and mr
as he gestures for them to make their walk to him a gust of wind lifts up fathers cassock exposing his bare ass
he quickly grabs his cassock and covers himself
he begins to walk toward the priest
suddenly out of nowhere cole appears at his side
dont you know its bad luck to see the groom before the wedding
i want debbie
you dump her and ill give you cash
whats debbies blue book value right now
five thousand dollars
they are now standing near father falwell
debbie is approaching them with mr
shoots cole a signal to up the ante
seventy five hundred
okay ten thousand plus a g
toaster oven a litton microwave a cuisinart
im marrying debbie
a set of sears best metric tools
to oneill what is this persons story here

cole what are you doing here
hes just trying to save you from making a mistake
to rick a big mistake
to cole cole go away
hes gonna hurt you debbie
hell never be true to you the way i would
well all keep that in mind
cole turns red with anger
pissed rick me and you arent through yet
he runs off
a la talk show host ladies and gentlemen cole whittier
lets hear it for him a funny funny guy
we love ya babe
the wind suddenly picks up
a storm is coming in off the sea
father falwells cassock blows up again
it starts to rain and hail
everyone runs for cover but rick and oneill
to oneill you think the gods are telling me something
rick is snuggled cozily on his side of the bed fast asleep
debbie is staring anxiously at the ceiling
after a couple of beats she tugs at ricks shoulder
i cant sleep
i got something for that
he groggily reaches into the nightstand pulls out a hammer
he raises it as if to hit debbie over the head
stop fooling around
i need to talk
whats the matter
i dont know
i just feel scared
he sits up about what
the wedding my parents your family our friends my job the future our relationship the caterers my gown your tuxedo our honeymoon the apartment my shower your bachelor party
i think the only think youve left out are our relations with the soviet union
sweetheart everythings gonna be all right
before or after i have my nervous breakfown
he starts to gently rub her shoulders
she breathes deeply trying to let go
that feels so great
thats very relaxing
now i want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland
he slowly lowers her to her pillow and tucks the covers in around her
continuing close your eyes
theres nothing to worry about
i love you
im a great guy
yawning in two days youre gonna be mrs
he yawns again and turns off the light on the night table
there is a beat of silence in the dark
we push in on their faces which are faintly illuminated by a street light outside the open window
both of them have their eyes wide open as they stare at the ceiling in fearful anticipation of the next day
the guys except gary are walking through the busy airport
you sure garys got this whole party deal together
yeah man hes got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks
i hope so
hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero
what time are we supposed to get to the hotel
dont worry chulo the partys not gonna start without you
we got plenty of time
i cant wait to see old larry
its been five years
people are streaming out of the plane
finally the last person exits
where the hell is he
knowing larry he probably missed the flight
there he is
talking very slowly guys
larry floats toward them and stops in front of them
he stares at them strangely looking from face to face
god i love you guys
to the guys surprise he goes around hugging each one of them
continuing this makes me so happy
they start walking toward the baggage claim area
so larry how have you been
just in love with everybody
its really a beautiful planet
i love you rick

so hows your wife
larry stops walking and immediately breaks down
i hate her
i hate her guts the bitch
larry you and your wife got problems
i dont want to talk about it
i love you guys
i love my friends
larry reaches into his pocket takes out a quaalude
continuing you want to share it
naw two on a quaalude
he pops it in his mouth
the guys exit the baggage area
rick is pushing larry who is sprawled out on top of his bags in a luggage cart
my marriage is the worst
a big pile of shit
maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while
she hates me
youll see as soon as you get married everything changes
you sure you want to go through with it man
his interest peaked what do you mean it changes
before larry can answer they reach the bus where debbie is waiting for them

he opens the door picks debbie up and carries her out to the sidewalk

they kiss and the guys whistle in the background
then debbie starts toward the house and rick hops back into the bus
he gets into the seat and sits there for a moment watching debbie with a guilty look as she goes into the house
to rick whats the matter
snapping out of it nothing
lets get crazy
when do the girls get to the party
dont worry garys taking care of that now
the guys holler and whoop it up as rick puts the bus in gear and takes off down the street
jumbo a well dressed behemoth in a sky blue suit and widebrimmed hat is standing on a street corner talking to gary
so we want your best girls the cream of your crop
lets see your bread
gary takes out a roll of bills which jumbo grabs and quickly counts
continuing okay i got just what youre looking for
calling off margot
two shapely hookers in tight fitting clothes come up to them
theyll do just fine
look after the orgy maybe we could have coffee
the girls look at him with is he for real
in their eyes
shorty wheres the party
gary takes some slips of paper out of his pocket and hands jumbo one
park view hotel room
theyll be up there in a half hour
nice to meet you both
gary turns almost collides with a garbage can and starts walking down the street
he passes a parked porsche
after a beat cole whittier sticks his head up and watches gary walk off
then he hops out of his car and approaches jumbo and the girls
i must have just missed my friend
he hired you for a bachelor party
at the park view hotel room
what about it
coles face lights up
this is the information he needed
takes out piece of paper this is the new address
we changed our minds and decided to send the girls over to his house instead
he takes out a fifty dollar bill
continuing and heres a fifty
i want this to be a surprise so you never saw me okay
pocketing the money no problem
cole smiles happily as he slithers back to his car
to himself now shell see what kind of jackoff he is
a parking valet crosses to the bus as rick hands him the keys
be careful with it
its a rental
the guys hop out with the enthusiasm of a home team thats just won the state championship
they race in the front door
a banner over the door reads welcome miss moosehead beer this is a pretty plush place
the kind of hotel that prides itself on its classy image
the guys are totally unaware of the sedate atmosphere in the lobby as they go screaming toward the elevators
to some dignified guests we who are about to go ape shit salute you
all right im stoked
just as they are about to get into the elevator a hand comes into frame and holds the door so it will not close
widen to include the manager
all their carrying on stops when the guys see him staring grimly at them
if he wasnt a hotel manager hed be a mortician
he has a constant expression on his face that suggests hes constantly sucking lemons
just where do you guys think you are
the library of congress
beyond the sun
are any of those right
this is the park view hotel
im the hotel manager
are you looking for someone
were looking for our room
rick takes out his key
its on the tenth floor
what do you know they moved it
catch you later
the door starts to close and the guys start yelling
keep your voices down
this is a respectable establishment
we dont go for any funny business here
just then a guy with a moosehead beer hat and two guys in a moose costume pass him and enter the elevator with the boys
i see what you mean
youre a beautiful guy
and youre doing a damn good job
the door slams shut before the manager can say anything else
several of debbies friends have arrived and are chatting amiably in the living room
phoebe is dipping potato chips into a bowl that says muffy on it
do you have any more of this dip mrs
its really excellent
you just ate purina cat chow
gross me out
debbie comes into the living room and sits next to bobbie
concerned what do you thinks gonna go on at the guys party
theyll probably get drunk and watch dirty movies
but dont worry about the dirty movies
what do you mean
i forgot to tell you
yesterday i found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of oneills car
i took care of em
starts to giggle rick ryko oneill chulo larry and stan are walking down the hallway looking for their room
spots the room aha
the guys give out a hearty cheer as they huddle around the door
oneill grabs the doorknob
he takes his time playing up the moment
continuing and now
the guys lean forward anticipating the opening of the gates of heaven
continuing to our honored guest rick and his life long friends i say
turns the doorknob gentlemen start your boners
he flings open the door and everyone but he and rick burst into the room
the guys all but dive into the room
it is a two room suite with living room kitcheonette and separate bedroom
the room has been decorated with balloons
a sign reads happy bachelor party
it looks far from professionally decorated
chulo frantically checks out the rooms
he hangs a chin up bar in a doorway and starts to chin himself
i did the balloons myself
he takes a prophylactic out of a trojan carton
he blows it up
on closer examination we see all the balloons are inflated prophylactics
chulo returns from his search of the rooms
crazed wheres the women man
we gotta have women
chulo one thing at a time
sex is my one thing
im good at it
a bit of a warm up
he threads a film projector
continuing well spend an hour with nymphos without pants
oliviers in that right
then its on to the real thing
cheering all right
ryko flips off the lights as oneill puts the projector into forward and the title flashes on a movie screen
all the guys yell in anticipation
we see a man stepping out of a shower
he puts on his robe and exits the bathroom
to his surprise and to the delight of our guys two young beautiful nordic looking women dressed in micro minis and see through blouses stand waiting for him
theyre danish i know it
im crazy for danes
sit watching the screen
to chulo denmark makes great nautilus equipment
id like to jerk and press those babies
to oneill and i thought we wouldnt have any meaningful conversation
the man takes off his robe
the girls start to seductively undress
excitedly all right yeah yeah yeah
suddenly an abrupt jump cut
the girls are undressed and lying on top of the man
our guys are seriously let down
he cant figure it out
as the women kiss the man from his head slowly down his chest past his navel and heading south
their eyes start to widen like a child in a keene painting
yes go go yes go
another abrupt jump cut spliced together with what looks like a band aid and the girls are sitting on the side of the bed
the man is recovering from the best sex hes ever encountered
rick turns to a shocked oneill
excuse me but this is as arousing as a stroll through the vatican
this isnt right
they watch the screen
the two women seem to be taking a liking to each other
they begin to fall onto the bed and entwine
please yes do it yes yes oh yes
a jump cut and they are dressing
stan cant take it anymore
he jumps to his feet
where are the dirty parts
im a doctor
i can see these things
what a waste of two women
oneill rises abruptly
i dont get it but at least garys got the real stuff coming up here in a few minutes
in ecstasy women
the girls are having a great time
the front doorbell rings
thomerson answers it
standing in the doorway is tina stahl stans wife shes late for the shower
behind her are two obvious hookers margot and darlene
tina doesnt know either of the girls
before tina can speak margot speaks up
shes reading from the piece of paper cole gave her
through heavy gum chewing yeah hi
look is this
margot reads the address
north franek avenue
im tina stahl
everyone come in
cole sits in his car and watches happily as the hookers go inside
debbie spots tina
she is oblivious to the two hookers
they give each other a big hug
the hookers watch closely
debbie leads tina to the other women
continuing you know everyone here dont you
the girls hug and give big hellos
meanwhile margot and darlene have come to the conclusion theyve been hired for a kinky scene
one of these huh
looks that way
bucks a buck
they start to unbutton their coats
tina hands debbie her present
its so heavy
she sits and the girls gather around as she starts to open the gift
phoebe happens to look off and is stunned by what she sees
the others are curious at what she is looking at and they too stare o
stunned to silence
dressed in leather and mesh stockings
margot carries a whip
darlene is holding a phallic electrical device
business like is there an empty outlet in here
debbie unconsciously points to a nearby wall
margot and darlene stand amidst the girls
darlene plugs in her device
she and margot start to embrace and fondle one another
the girls watch in stony silence
dumbfounded at what they see
margot and darlene start to sink to the floor out of our sight
before they disappear we see margot take out her gum and park it on an end table
now out of sight the girls watch for a beat
then we hear the whirring of darlenes implement
our girls screech in horror and hold onto one another in a protective clump
the guys are sitting around drinking eating and looking generally bored
chulo sits in front of the tv glumly watching an old i love lucy re run
if i was ricky ricardo i would beat the shit out of that chick
totally ripped staring at the black and white image wow
the colors are sooo beautiful
chulo gives him a strange look
opening a beer reading the label isnt there any beer thats not imported
all this stuffs from st
calling to imaginary person o
bartender round of brains for my friend here
gary enters the room
hes all smiles
confident hes done a great job arranging for the entertainment
hows it going guys
everyone crowds around him like children greeting daddy
looking for candy hidden in his coat
wheres the girls
wheres the girls
rick pushes them away from gary like a referee separating two fighters
give the guy air
everyone to a neutral corner
whats going on
we got no women
this place should have been wall to wall tits by now
to oneill guy paints a beautiful picture
im going to see what the hell happened
looks like the only one who got screwed here was you
he exits out the door
so what do you guys think of the party so far
the guys toss sandwiches and empty beer cans at him
putting his arm around oneill well i think youve done a damn fine job
everyone pelts rick and oneill with more junk
suddenly the door bursts open
the guys look up and are surprised to see cole enter
rick i want to talk to you
turns to the others i dont remember ordering an asshole from room service
cole enters closing the door behind him
i dont want any trouble
oh come on just a little
im ready to make you another deal
mock excitement ooh be still my heart
points out window see that down there

coles porsche parked in the hotel parking lot
rick gestures to chulo to look out the window
his voice tells us he has something in mind isnt that a great car chulo
chulo gets ricks drift
ah excuse me

he starts to exit
before he does he grabs a hanger out of the closet
i love that car

they back away from the window

surprised the car for debbie
getting a little excitable i mean it
the car is yours
gee guys what should i do

all the guys treat this as if its lets make a deal
they take sides yelling out take the car keep debbie
over the din we hear a befuddled rick
continuing what a decision here
he walks over to the window
cole follows closely
hes trying to convince rick to take the car
handles like a dream
so does debbie
chulo is using the hanger to jimmy the car lock on coles porsche
he jumps into the car and drives off
rick and cole are at the window
the guys are still trying to convince rick on his decision
i got the car only two months ago its got as he looks out the window we see with him that his car is gone
continuing shit shit shit shit
my cars gone
maybe it had something to do
he charges out of the room
hes only been gone a few seconds and i already miss him
gary spots jumbo on the same grimy street corner
hes pimping for one of his ladies and makes a sale to an anxious young marine as gary approaches him
jumbo where the hell are the women
what are you talking about asshole
your whores never showed up
they left an hour ago pink nuts
jumbo has had enough
he backs gary against a wall and pulls a knife on him
irritated a lot thats it prick lips

gary hurriedly digs into his pockets and gives jumbo his money
this is bad public relations
i was planning to do a lot of business with you
but now im going to have to go elsewhere
mock sincerity hey
you want girls
ill give you girls
he snaps his fingers and two of his ladies come forward
continuing to girls give him the works
thats more like it
the girls walk over to gary and proceed to beat the crap out of him
it is a garish nightclub
a large lighted billboard proclaims all male
two cars pull into the parking lot
debbie and all of her shower guests get out
are you sure this is a good idea
look you heard what those hookers said
they were supposed to go to a bachelor party
that doesnt mean it was ricks party
debbie men are pigs if they can have women we can have men
reluctantly i dont know about this
cmon mother itll be fun
the girls giggle as they enter the place with mrs
thomerson following reluctantly behind
look at that guy
what a hunk
check out the other guys buns
lets sit over here
they head for some empty tables
debbie notices her mother is still standing transfixed by the man on display on stage
debbie grabs her by the shoulder
on the way to the table they pass michael the bartender who looks at them and immediately recognizes debbie
finding this interesting he picks up a phone and dials
softly into phone yes
is there a rick stahl registered there
gary beaten up his clothes ripped stands amidst the guys
hookers beat you up

the guys start toward the door
zonked and depressed guys i think id rather stay here

i just want to be alone
now theres milk and cookies in the refrigerator
go to bed right after falcon crest
as larry slumps on the couch the guys exit
rick and the guys exit the hotel
as they exit mr
both parties are oblivious to the others presence
thomerson is greeted by a moosehead beer executive who is wearing a straw hat that says moosehead beer
ed were so glad you could come over at the last minute and judge our little beauty pageant
my pleasure al
always happy to help out in a pinch
looking around excuse me

he enters a phone booth and starts to dial
to executive covering mouthpiece i had to get out of the house anyway tonight
the wife is throwing a bridal shower for my daughter
into phone this is ed thomerson

reading number off phone
he crosses with executive toward the ballroom
congratulations on your daughters wedding
whos she marrying

they exit into ballroom
amidst the kitchen activities we see rick oneill ryko stan and michael
so will your friend nick do it
hell do anything for money
i love his attitude
calling off they still out there
hes peeking through the kitchen door
we see debbie and the shower girls whooping it up at a ringside table
stan turns back to rick
breathing heavy at ringside
he joins the other guys
a la long john silver so they want action eh
are you with me me hardies
the guys shout approval as nick one of the male dancers enters carrying a tray of food
nick is a muscled hunk
guys this is chippendales star attraction nicholas carter
better known as nick the dick
nick the what
nick drops his pants
since hes being shot only from the waist up we cant see what the guys see
proudly the dick
astonished at this o
sight jesus christ
lets get this thing going
nick holds the tray waist high
rick arranges the food
continuing looks good
can i have the bun michael
michael hands rick a hot dog bun
rick places it on the tray
he turns to nick
continuing and now nick
or is it mr
nick if you would be so kind
he holds the tray with one hand
with the other he reaches out of frame
in a nutshell what he does is place his honker in the hot dog bun
as he slaps his business into the bun we hear a solid thump
nick the rest is all yours
excusing himself gentlemen
as he does our guys crowd around and peek through the kitchen door
we follow him as he approaches the girls table
if you ladies would like to serve yourselves
the girls grab their orders
hers is the hot dog
she points to it
is this the foot long
and then some
grabs the hot dog
it wont come off the tray
she yanks harder
nick drops the tray and mrs
finally comes to realize what she is pulling on
she screams in terror
because of sheer fright she cant seem to drop nicks schlong from her grip
the rest of our ladies look to see mrs
s hot dog
they scream in shock
debbie spits out her marguerita hitting phoebe in the face
they are busting a gut watching the girls reactions
she looks up just in time to see the guys close the kitchen door
still frozen in a state of shock
the girls try to pry her hands off
several hookers are standing around
gary approaches them
talk to the pimp
she gestures to a man with his back to us
the pimp turns around and we see he is the stereotypical pimp
one big difference hes an indian straight from the streets of calcutta
hes soft spoken and ever smiling and he still hasnt quite mastered english
oh so heavy indian accent what can i be doing for you
youre a pimp
im telling you i am joe
i want women
that i got
very good women
they sit on your face anything you want
ill take some
big problem now
soon they go to customers
i need them for a bachelor party at the park view hotel
you are being in luck
customers in same hotel
i let you have them at cut rate price for minutes
not one minute longer or milt will come for you
milt joins them
milt is a massive hulk
a bearded exbiker
he could have come out of an mx silo
a menacing mountain of a man decked out in a cowboy hat
this being milt
milt casually takes off his hat and immediately sticks his face through a nearby window smashing it to pieces
he pulls his head out smiles and puts his hat back on
continuing girls back in minutes or milt cuts your balls off
gary extends his hand and they shake
to himself as he walks to his car i just bet my balls and shook on it
the guys are piling back out of the bus into the hotel
the manager watches them suspiciously
rick oneill ryko and stan come back into the room
concerned calling larry
rick crosses to the bathroom door opens it and goes in
larry is on his knees on the side of the tub with his head submerged fully under several inches of water
continuing what are you doing
larry comes out of the water
he gasps for breath and speaks
im killing myself
he takes a deep breath and submerges his head again
rick unplugs the tub and it begins to drain
youve got to lighten up
you and the wife can work it out
the water has drained from the tub leaving larry high and dry
he lifts his head out of the tub
in his state hes unaware that the water is gone
he gasps for air as rick holds him up
sometimes when people are mad they say things they dont mean
no she hates me
i want to end everything here
larry takes a deep breath and plunges his head into the tub
his head hits the waterless tub bottom with a loud thud
he goes limp from the concussion
his body drapes into the tub head first
yeah i guess so
i see youre right
cmon lets party
larry gets up and exits the room
push in on rick
he looks after larry concerned
to himself he aint all right
cole sits in a phone booth holding the receiver impatiently
the receiver is off the hook
after a beat mr
crosses to the phone
cole does not see him and vice versa
yes son did you find out where the bachelor party is
yes i did
hows everything going
not so good
he wouldnt listen to reason
he stole my car
i cant find it anywhere
so hes playing hard ball
well two can play that game
yelling go after him
stop at nothing
you hear me
im sorry sir i cant hear you
looking over into the next booth he sees thomersons back
continuing some fat slob in the next booth is making a lot of noise
well tell the asshole to shut up
calling off hey shut up
sorry i cant hear you
some pin heads yelling
shut up im talking here
into phone now look i want you to go back and i dont care what you do
stop that marriage
he slams the phone down and exits screen right
cole starts to exit left when he spots chulo getting into the elevator
hey man your cars looking good
crazed where is it
the elevator doors slam shut
cole races out into the street
cole comes bursting out into the street
we can tell by his shocked expression he doesnt like what he sees
shit shit shit shit shit
camera pans as he charges to his porsche
his pride and joy has now thanks to chulo been customized into a chicano special
its chopped and channeled dingleberries rim the back window flames have been painted on the rear fender a chain steering wheel fuzzy dashboard dice hanging from the mirror
a real east l
hes snapped totally flipped
he turns and yells up to the hotel screaming rick
hes standing near the window
i think thats for me
he looks out the window and sees cole standing next to his transformed porsche
debbie is mine
shell always be
yelling back cole when was the last time you had a lobotomy
furious youve had it
im gonna get you
cole hops in his car and drives off blowing his horn at oncoming traffic
the horn plays la cucuracha
cole slams his fist on the steering wheel in disgust
to guys dont you love it when old friends stop by
to rick hey im starved
lets go get something to eat
well bring back food for everybody
im not really hungry
he grabs rick by the arm and leads him out of the room
rick is finishing giving the food order to a waiter
in the b
we see oneill talking to a bellhop
the bellhop is pointing to a table
oneill thanks him and slips him some money
couple more on rye
lots of fries
and a burger and diet soda
waiter acknowledges hes got it and exits
oneill joins rick
lets sit down
oneill leads rick to the table the bellhop pointed out
they sit down
immediately oneill takes some cash from his pocket and holds it under the table
huddled underneath the table hidden by the tablecloth is a hooker
her specialty is coming right up
she grabs the bills from oneills hand
she tucks the money in her cleavage and turns her talents to rick
she unzips his fly
he reacts to the zip sound
what the hell is that
my gift to you
under the table
the best table in the house
the hooker has begun to do what she does best
and rick loves it
i think we can skip the wine list
enters the restaurant
he spots rick and oneill and crosses to them
boys good evening to you
rick tries to maintain his dignity
but from under the table a blue ribbon job is being applied to his fun zone
father falwell good evening
falwell shakes ricks hand
rick hangs on for dear life
pumping the hand up and down at a faster and faster rate
falwell pries his hand loose
so rick soon you will be a married man
how does it feel
well nice seeing you both
ricks excitement heightens as the hooker pulls out all stops
ooooooooh jesus oh god god god god oh jesus jeeeesussss
father falwell looks on rather perplexed
rick sees falwells puzzled look
continuing i was just saying grace
before rick can speak we hear a voice from under the table
ricks hand exits frame and zips up his pants
then rick and oneill get up
father would you like to take our table
oneill cant believe what rick is about to do
he sits in ricks spot
rick leans on the table to say his final farewell to the priest
he takes this moment to get some money out of his pocket and hold it under the table
the hooker grabs the money
i think youll enjoy this table
so long father
he and rick suppressing a laugh exit
father falwell picks up the menu
we hear the zip sound
father perks up
he doesnt know what the hell is happening
oneill turns to rick as theyre leaving the coffee shop
i dont get it
why didnt you go for it just now
i dont know
maybe its because i love debbie or maybe its hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad
im not sure
rick and oneill enter the suite
no one is there
where the hell is everybody
everyone jumps out from their hiding places
with our guys is gary and his team of five prostitutes
gesturing to the girls the team bus just pulled in
its a party
one of our hookers kelley gets everyones attention
whos first guys
everyone acts as if theyre in grade school
they raise their hands they come on like kids trying to get the teachers attention
the guest of honor should be first
nah thats okay
my brother has to look up old peoples asses all day long
lets give him a break
give me the will to live
let me go first
a moving plea
okay doc you lead off
ill screw clean up
everyone cheers stans good fortune
kelley takes stan by the hand and leads him into the bedroom
gary turns on a record and everyone starts dancing
larry is laying out drugs on a table
they consist of lines of coke and various happy time pills of all colors and shapes
rick takes a look at the layout
a drug smorgasbord
he sees the party has taken off
i have returned
he spots a sweet faced young hooker laverne
she is prancing around in her bra and underwear
chulo wants her
continuing points to her you
laverne is frightened of chulo
mainly because hes coming at her like a sex starved buffalo
chulo goes after her
scared she runs around the room then out the door
chulo gives chase
to oneill chulos got such a nice light touch with women
laverne runs down the hall closely pursued by chulo
an all female new wave band comes to the door
oneill greets them
you made it
you can set up over there
as they enter we go to chulo is on the heels of laverne
she bursts through a door to excape him
laverne finds herself on the stage of a beauty pageant still in her bra and panties
five other ladies are dressed in their bathing suits
chulo stops short of running on stage
laverne seeking the safety of the moment stands in line with the contestants
they like what they see
to another great bathing suit
indicating laverne i think i screwed that one once
debbie and the shower guests are all in a state of undress
we watch as they put on dresses and heavy makeup
thomerson is still freaked out over her meeting with nick the dick
i had his weiner right in my hands
i told you
men are pigs
i saw them standing there
what a gross thing to do
i bet right now rick and his pals
she spits disdainfully are knee deep in whores
a strange wang right in my palm
ilene we dont really know that
thats what were going to find out
i feel like im spying on rick
thats just what were doing
ill kill stan if i find out hes been screwing around
ilene shoves socks in her bra to enhance her cleavage and defiantly slaps on her new dress
brett are you with us
coming out of her fog yeah sure
i was eye to eye with an unfamiliar pud
the party is taking off
the all girl band is going ape shit
the guys are dancing with the hookers
theyre all moving in unison to a gyrating new wave dance step and singing along with the music
hes wearing gravity boots hanging upside down entwined around one of the hookers
theyre hanging there making out like crazy
gary passes by
hey gary spot me
stan comes out of the bedroom
hes disheveled but looks very happy
he crosses to rick
thanks a lot that was the best
nah not yet
look youre my older brother
i need some advice here
whats the deal with marriage
what can i expect
well the first month its great
the second month things calm down a little
by the third month youre looking through your old girlfriends phone numbers by the fourth month youre numb by the fifth month hopefully the football season starts
thanks stan youve been a lot of help
stan pats rick on the back and dives into the festivities
he spots someone across the room
its like tony spotting maria for the first time in west side story
as in a dream sequence all sounds stop
two pinspots hit them
she turns and sees him
both are madly in love
like two pieces of metal attracted to the same magnet they walk toward each other
they take each other by the hand
they walk into the bedroom and close the door behind them
the new wave dance briefly continues then comes to an end
oneill grabs ryko who is just coming down from his gravity bar and stan who is wearing a pair of womens underwear on his head
you guys better get going
its getting late
ryko and stan cross to the door and exit
as they do four or five pretty girls are passing by in the hallway
is there a party going on in there or something
go on in
the girls cross inside
lets hurry back
there is a pained tragic and extremely stoned out look on his face as he sighs deeply and then summons up his courage
widen as he looks down at his right wrist
he heaves another deep sigh and brings an electric razor into frame
he turns it on and runs it over his wrist
of course nothing happens
just then rick enters
what the hell are you doing
im trying to slash my wrists
youre trying to kill yourself with an electric razor
i couldnt find any razor blades
well this is terrific
now youre gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable
just go out there
forget about everything and laugh it up
suddenly laughs like a crazy man ha ha ha
no have fun first
now forget about marriage for a while
as he shoves larry out gary enters the bathroom
his expression tells us hes had the best sex of his life
gary how we doing big stallion
rick i really think im in love
this is cause for celebration
shell probably charge half price for sex from now on
rick exits as gary dreamily crosses to the mirror
into mirror this time its real
garys woman enters and closes the door
their eyes meet
gary takes her hand and kisses it gently
she turns away then lifts up the toilet seat lifts up her dress and proceeds to pee
she is a man
gary is stunned
his jaw drops open
garys dream girl guy finishes his business
he drops his dress and turns to gary
the names tim
im always available
he blows a kiss and starts to leave but turns back
by the way
i also do engine work on bmws
gary feels filthy
he rips open the cabinet takes out tooth paste and toothbrush and vigorously brushes his teeth
he rips off his clothes and jumps in the shower and scrubs as if hes scraping barnacles off a hull of a tugboat
ryko and stan drive up to a country stable
they get out of the car and open a barn door
both are pleased at what they see
standing there is a donkey eating straw
cole drives up in his chulo customized porsche
he gets out then reaches back into the car and takes out a crossbow the heavy duty metal kind hunters use
he looks up menacingly at the hotel and spots the room where the party is going on
he sees another hotel across the way
he gets an idea and enters the other hotel
the party is going full blast
some other girls and a couple of guys hotel guests enter the room and are quickly swept up in the spirit of the party
oneill approaches rick
rick im concerned
this is your bachelor party
you havent had sex with anyone yet
trying to joke his way out of it get a few drinks into me well dance and see what happens
i got something you cant resist
i have a friend tracey
she wants to meet you
she loves to please
indicating the bedroom right in there pal
if im not out in a half hour send for the paramedics
thats the old rick
rick enters the bedroom
its dark but for a lamp on the nightstand which is on
in one corner of the room we see the figure of a woman
tracey walks toward rick
the light illuminates her
what we see is truly the most beautiful woman on earth
she is totally nude
a vision that would make any man screw and ask questions later
to himself overwhelmed by her eat my chair
rick instinctively makes a move toward her
he decides to go for it
just then a strange thing happens to traceys face
it transforms into debbies
rick stops dead in his tracks
he cant believe it
debbies face is now on traceys body
you promised me rick
you promised you wouldnt make love to anyone else
rick is shaken by this
he shakes his head and wipes at his eyes
debbies face is gone
he moves toward tracey again
her face transforms into sister mary francis
dont go back on your word rick
be true be strong
sister mary franciss face disappears
i cant do it
her face becomes stans
look at me im beautiful
stans face turns back to traceys
all the kids from his bus are gathered around tracey
theyre egging him on
put her away
go for it
debbies face appears on traceys
pleading dont rick
debbies face disappears
rick cant take it anymore
i cant do it
i love debbie
he runs out of the room leaving a very confused tracey in his wake
oneill is waiting outside the bedroom door as rick comes out
howd it go
put it to you this way youre gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula mister
im proud of you lad
rick crosses to the bar area as oneill watches him go beaming
cole enters the room
he runs to the window
his window is right opposite the window in the hotel of ricks party
he places an arrow into his crossbow
hes looking down his sights
rick is the target
and an easy one at that for at this very moment rick is crossing past the window
the door opens and in walks rajah the indian pimp
he looks pissed
hes looking for gary
angry am looking for this dunghead who took my women
he is being liar to me
minutes way over
he has rick right where he wants him
coles finger squeezes off a shot
luckily he starts to dance with a female guest
this takes him out of line of the arrow
the arrow zooms through the open window
rajah is standing by the door
the arrow zips through the room misses everyone and lodges in the wall inches from rajahs head
he looks at the arrow and realizes he almost was killed
frightened holy dung is this thing
i sic milt on you
he get back bitches
i haul ass
he runs out of the room
rick and oneill watch rajah exit confused
who was that
i dont know
looking at arrow whats this
just then another arrow comes zipping through the room lodging in a chair inches from rick
to new arrow how bout this
still drawing a blank
they turn in the direction the arrow came from and look out the window
they spot cole loading his bow in the room across the way
he look familiar
get the hookers in a circle
we better put cochise out of business
they start for the door as we go to chulo is waiting outside a door that says dressing room
several of the beauty contestants race out wearing formal gowns
laverne follows them wearing a very tight black dress
chulo approaches her
stay away from me
im not gonna hassle you
you look beautiful
nervous think so
i borrowed it from one of the girls
i dont look too fat
youre an angel
laverne is moved by this
before she can respond a stage manager takes her by the arm and pushes her on stage
chulo watches laverne enter the stage to hearty applause
thomerson and the other judges sit in the front row making notes
the girls are lined up on pedestals as the mc approaches laverne all right here is your question miss
he looks through his cards hurriedly and is unable to find lavernes
how would you solve our countrys present economic problems
thats a good question
from the way i understand it according to supply side economics when supply exceeds demand recession is the result
thats why i think we should control the credit markets and increase the prime rate
that way the consumer price index will stabilize and we will have economic recovery
they break into spontaneous applause
he is totally blown away
she smiles broadly at the applause and walks off stage
chulo moves alongside her
howd you know all that stuff
youre a real brain
nah i used to fuck a librarian
chulo looks at her with awe and respect as she exits into the dressing room
debbie her mother and the girls enter the lobby
they approach the hotel manager who is standing behind the front desk
they are dressed garishly like hookers
debbie has on a cheap blonde wig and mini skirt
the manager looks at them the way one would look at an approaching plague
i dont believe were doing this
the manager crosses to them
can i help you ladies
yes were looking for the stahl party
the girls turn and start toward the elevator
thomerson who is wearing the kind of push up bra that makes her tits look like the black hills smiles at the manager seductively
he smiles back then catches himself
to bellboy those guys are asking for it
the girls cross to the elevator
ilene pushes the button and the doors swing open
they get inside and just before the doors close a huge behemoth of a man joins them inside
he turns and faces camera
its milt rajahs beefy helper
he doesnt look happy as he eyes the girls
they look back at him uncomfortably as the doors slam shut
the elevator door opens
milt has all the girls by the collar and hustles them down the hall
youre making a big mistake
you still got another job to do here
what kind of job
im a housewife
milt stops at a door and kicks it with his foot
the door opens a crack at first then swings open wide revealing six middle aged japanese business men in their underwear
they smile wide at the girls obviously thrilled with the quality of the merchandise delivered to them
milt shoves them into the room
get in there
he slams the door shut and exits
the guys start to move toward our panicked girls
they speak to each other in japanese with english subtitles nice looking quim huh bob
yeah you know me ray ive always been a sucker for redheads
lets get out of here girls
they turn toward the door
one of the japanese races over and gets there first slamming and bolting the door shut
guys take it easy
the girls run around the room in a panic with the japanese chasing them in very hot pursuit
rick oneill and tracey quietly approach coles door
tracey is dressed in a see through negligee
this is it
he positions tracey outside the door go get im
he and oneill duck around the hallway corner out of sight
he is at the window holding his crossbow
he is frantically searching the bachelor party across the way for any sign of rick
where the hell is he
he hears a knock on the door
cole quickly hides his crossbow under the bed and answers the door
tracey stands in the open door
coles jaw drops open
he has never seen anything as lovely
make love to me
she walks into the room
cole closes the door
rick and oneill run up to the door
they listen closely
we hear the sound of coles shirt being ripped off the buttons flying around the room then the sound of his pant zipper being undone
we have ignition
e and oneill burst into the room and close the door
oneill is tying the end of a sheet around the bed post
we see the bed is minus its sheets and blankets
all set here
the guys have tied the sheets and blankets together and made a rope
the other end is tied around coles chest
and thats all cole is wearing hes nude
you guys are never going to get away with this
rick stuffs coles underwear in his mouth to gag him
were just going to keep you in a safe place until after the party
he and oneill lift cole up and put him out the window
they hang onto the sheet blanket rope and lower him slowly outside
we see cole being lowered from the window
hes struggling but can do nothing about his predicament
he looks down
the hotel parking lot is ten stories below
he looks up to the guys
they look down at him from the window above
now dont get into any trouble
they duck inside the window
rick oneill and tracey exit the room
to tracey dont you wish you were a guy so you could have fun like this
hes scared to death
we see that coles weight is pulling the bed to the window
hes slowly lowering down the side of the building
a young couple enters the room
they are very much in love
he gives her a kiss and closes the door
why dont you get comfortable
she smiles coyly and starts to undress
he crosses to the closed blinds
continuing theres a wonderful moon out tonight
he opens the blinds revealing coles ass pressed up against the window
she screams horrified
the girls are being hotly pursued by the japanese men
subtitled hey bob this beats the shit out of sushi doesnt it
the bed moves right up against the wall under the window
we see the end tied to the bed post is beginning to untie
the knot unties
he falls out of frame
the rope trailing behind
the young couple from the room are seated in his sportscar
hes cranking open the sun roof
babe i didnt know anything about that
the sun roof opens
suddenly coles ass sticks through it
the woman freaks out again
we see a groggy cole sitting in the sun roof
the man in the car is trying to calm down his lady
chulo and laverne are standing in the wings while in the b
we can see the mc singing the moosehead beer jingle
then all right can we have our five finalists please
good luck laverne
laverne and the five finalists go out on stage
he gives an envelope to the mc
thank you mr
well the judges have made their decision and this years miss moosehead beer is
they are all nervous especially laverne
laverne squeals with delight and hugs the mc as he puts the bejeweled crown on her head
then the mc leads her to the microphone
teary eyed i cant believe it
this is the happiest day of my life and i owe it all to him
she points o
to chulo chulo with tears in his eyes comes out on stage and in a surge of emotion picks laverne up off her feet and hugs her passionately
i know ive had that girl
looking at chulo and i know that guy from somewhere too
the other judge looks at mr
camera pushes in to a car in the parking lot which is towing a u haul trailer behind it
the car stops and turns off its lights
stan and oneill sit in the car looking at the hotel
how the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside
i dont know
i thought you told me you had it all figured out
maybe i did
i dont remember
through clenched teeth id love to get you in an operating room
just then the moose from the beauty pageant steps outside the hotel for a smoke
the guy in front removes the head takes a drag of his cigarette and passes it to the guy bringing up the rear
after a beat smoke steams out the rear end of the costume
they both have the same idea
they stroll out of the car and approach the two men in the moose suit
we cant hear what theyre saying but we can see the bills stan is taking out of his pocket
ryko grabs the moosehead and runs over to the trailer with it
the door opens and stan and ryko enter pulling the moose by a rope
can you believe how perfect it fits
whod have thought theyd both be a size regular
just then rick and oneill saunter into the lobby
hey you guys
whos your friend
keeping it a surprise oh
the guys from the beer convention
were bringing them to the party
to moose i was wondering how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing
at that moment he hears a splat hit the ground
the guys look down and see a large shiny clump of shiny brown excrement nestled in the shag carpet
continuing say no more
the manager crosses to them
i dont know which one of you did this but youre not going anywhere till you clean up this disgusting mess
resigned anybody got a paper towel or a shovel or something
all the guests turn away in disgust
stan takes out a handkerchief and hands it to rick who closes his eyes and picks up the warm little bundle
the manager turns and walks off in a huff
on the way back to the elevator rick checks to see no one is watching and places the handkerchiefs contents on the front desk just out of frame
smiling contentedly the guys lead the reluctant moose into the elevator
the doors slam shut
the manager is just finishing checking in a couple from out of town
ill have the boy take your bags up
he goes to hit the bell and to his surprise his hand comes down on something soft and mushy
the look on his face tells us what it is
its the gift rick left behind
to couple excuse me
i seem to have a hand full of potty
revolted he races into a room marked men
the doors open and several people from the moosehead beauty pageant come out
thomerson is one of them
thanks for helping us out ed
we appreciate it
any time al
crosses to the door just as cole comes running in slightly dazed wrapped in the tattered remnants of the sheet that held him suspended out the window
they both are shocked to see one another
cole my god boy what are you doing here
nearly hysterical the bachelor partys upstairs
they made me get naked
they hung me from the window so high up it was so scary i fell down
take hold of yourself
what room are they in
all right ill go up there and take care of this myself
disgusted you look awful son
go find yourself some clothes
with a determined look thomerson crosses to the elevator as cole runs into the hotel gift shop
rick ryko stan oneill enter with the moose
we brought back a friend
for your viewing pleasure meet mike the magical sexual mule
oneill lifts the head off the moose costume revealing a real burro
the burro shows all his teeth as burros are apt to do when excited
oneill and stan zip off the rest of his costume revealing a well endowed beast
surprised how about this a trojan donkey
and heres mikes partner in more ways than one
a gal who doesnt think happiness ends with primates
the very lovely miss desiree
desiree an erotic tall woman wearing a leather face mask comes out of the bedroom carrying a long whip
desiree puts ravels bolero on the phonograph then she starts to sway her hips sensuously in front of the animal
they all scream and holler approval
she rubs up against the donkey shaking her backside against the animals
shes gonna pin her tail on the donkey
now all eyes are on desiree as she does an erotic striptease
it is getting bored and a little hungry
it bends its head to the left and spots the table with food on it
it bends over and starts munching on some cole slaw
to the catcalls of the partygoers desiree is getting all worked up stripping down to a g string
its had enough cole slaw
now it sniffs at larrys drug smorgasbord and then starts to chomp on a few pills
next it sticks its head into the lines of coke and snorts them up in one gigantic sniff
she lets her long flowing hair hang down over her breasts
then she takes a mattress and sets it on the floor
she rolls on it and sways her hips sensuously on her knees
rick cant believe hes seeing this
the other guys are screaming at the top of their lungs
even larry seems spell bound
it doesnt look so hot as it finishes off every drug on the table
she moves over to the donkey hits him on the side gently with her whip then pulls him over to her mattress
the donkeys blood shot eyes are the size of saucers
once again he shows his teeth in a kind of shit eating grin
desiree drops to the mattress and beckons the animal to her
mike the donkey obediently does as hes told moving to her in a trance like very turned on state
come to mama
the donkey takes another step forward and then suddenly rears up on his hind legs snorting
he starts bucking wildly
the crowd moves out of his way as the animal goes berserk for a few seconds then without warning collapses in a heap on the floor
everyone goes rushing up to it
chulo and laverne enter the room followed by several of the other contestants and others from the beauty pageant
excited hey you guys im getting married
to laverne were gonna make lots of kids
he looks over and sees everyone gathered around mike
what the hell happened
gary shushes him
we push in on dr
stan who is listening for signs of life in the animals chest
finally stan stands up somberly
you mean its
i did everything i could
its my fault
hes dead because
i left those drugs
its really not all your fault
i was talking to mike earlier and he had a lot of problems
personal things you know
made some bad investments
at least now hes peaceful
cmon we gotta get this thing out of here
oneil places the moosehead on the donkey as rick gary chulo and stan pull the donkey out into the hall like pallbearers at a funeral
thomerson whos been standing at the door takes this time to sneak into the suite right behind them
thomerson cant believe the goings on
people are making out drinking and dancing
he hides in a corner to watch undercover
the guys shove the donkey onto the elevator and the doors snap shut
on phone yes
of course we dont allow that sort of thing here maam
well im sorry the noise woke you
ill take care of it right away
he hangs up and crosses to the elevator
ive had enough of this
just then the elevator door swings open
the donkey falls out into the lobby
the manager screams in terror as do several of the hotel guests
continuing thats it
im calling the cops
some more uninvited guests come drifting into the room
welcome welcome one and all
recognizing the voice oh no
he turns and spots mr
thomerson as he makes his way through the party
thomerson goes nose to nose with rick
this is it
when debbie hears about this shell never see you again
now im calling the cops to break up this sex orgy
and toss your ass in jail
he turns away and walks out of frame
oneill crosses to rick
what are you going to do about it
defeated what can i do
debbies going to go crazy and end the whole thing
ill stop him
you stall him
thomerson is heading for the phone in the bedroom
thomerson stops and turns to rick
continuing dramatic please no
dont ruin my life
he drops to his knees and hugs thomersons legs
the party stops and everyone watches
continuing its not me
i was brought up on the wrong side of the tracks
a victim of my environment
larry is handing oneill a plastic bag filled with white powder
is that all the coke in the place
oneill unscrews the mouthpiece off the phone
he pours the bag of cocaine into the phone
he then screws the mouthpiece back on over this mound of powder
satisfied with his work he exits the bedroom
thomerson is trying to free himself from ricks grasp as rick continues with his hard luck story
my poor old mammy had to take in laundry
my pappy had to work hours a day at the pez factory
oneill gestures to rick that everythings ready
rick immediately jumps to his feet
no sob story is going to change my mind
thomerson pushes oneill aside and enters the bedroom
the phones all yours
thomerson in the bedroom picks up the receiver
as he does so a cloud of cocaine falls out of the mouthpiece
he screams at rick gesturing with the phone in his hand as he dials
each move produces a large cloud of powder which causes him to sniffle slightly
i never liked you
ive never liked any of your friends
ive hated you from the first time i saw you
and now you are out of my life
you are out of my life
he starts to react from inhaling the powder
he puts the receiver to his ear
he takes a deep breath and tries to dial another number
a large cloud of coke flies up his nose
he takes another deep drag
he forgets all about dialing
he jams the receiver against his nose and takes deep drag after deep drag
desiree still wearing her leather mask crosses to him and sits down next to him on the bed
he gives her a big wide smile
oneill closes the door
reach out and snort someone
everyone starts to whoop it up again
its still a standoff between the girls and the horny japanese
lets give them what they want
debbie opens the bedroom door and motions for the japanese to file in
the japanese immediately put two and two together and get orgy
these are some happy fellas as they enter the bedroom
deb were pretending to be hookers
herding in the last japanese right in here
the big show starts in one minute
the japanese man enters the room
debbie slams the door shut behind him
look girls ill stay behind and hold them off
the rest of you break for it
ilene are you crazy
i know what im doing
the girls run out the door
she has what she wants
she walks into the bedroom surrounded by panting japanese
gentlemen the gods have answered your prayers
she takes a running leap and dives on top of the japanese
debbie and the ladies run to an elevator
debbie presses the down button
i hope ilenes all right
i hope those guys are all right
the elevator door opens revealing the donkey lying flat on his back
his stiff legs point skyward
the girls see him and scream
they run down the hall to the stairway
on the way debbie notices shes passing room
she hears the party sounds inside
she heads for the room angrily
this is a lady out to even a score
as debbie opens the door her father walks by with desiree on his arm
neither sees the other
debbie enters the room
she is surprised by the masses of humanity rubbing shoulders with one another in the room
oneill looks over from the other side of the room and spots her
he isnt fooled for a minute by her wig and mini skirt
he runs over to rick
guess whos here
another surprise guest
whats with her costume
oneill points and rick sees debbie
she doesnt see them
continuing i dont know
go up to her make like you dont know her and send her into the other bedroom
you got it
oneill crosses to debbie
continuing hi baby
youre new here
i dont think the grooms had you yet has he
push in on debbie
no not yet
where is he
rick opens the door from the bathroom
the lights are turned off and from the flashing illumination of a neon sign outside the window we can make out the outline of debbies body on the bed
i cant see anything
debbie in a disguised southern accent speaks out
dont turn on the lights sugar
seductively ill lead you around
a seeing eye hooker
why dont you get undressed
rick starts to undress
while undressing he takes on the persona of mr
he sings rodgers opening theme in that same sappy child like manner of his
singing its a lovely day in the neighborhood
its a lovely day its a beauty would you be mine could you be mine
hes now stripped down to his underwear please wont you be my neighbor
today were going to learn about anatomy
he jumps on top of her and starts mauling her passionately
debbie snaps on the lights
she throws off her wig and she and rick come face to face
youre a hooker
i cant believe it
she all but jumps out of bed
i cant trust you
cmon i knew it was you
holding back tears rick youre lying
as rick protests she throws on her blouse and runs out of the room
rick charges after her
the place is wall to wall people
she tries to make her way to the exit but her path is slowed by all the happy revelers
yelling over the din furious let go of me
yelling back debbie im telling you i didnt do anything hardly
the marriage is off
now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life
i dont want that
i want to be with you
and i want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment
i am committed
i love you
just then desiree and mr
thomerson cross through frame
shes leading him around by the silver chain which is now attached to his neck
shes also carrying a leather whip
i dont believe you
you dont believe me
rick gets up on the sofa and yells loudly over the din
can i have your attention
everyone stops what theyre doing and looks up
continuing i want to ask you all a question
have i had sex with anybody in this room tonight
theres a negative response from the crowd
continuing are you sure
everyone responds positively
continuing thank you
all the guests go back to partying
rick drops off the sofa and faces debbie
and these are not just ordinary party goers there are professionals in this crowd i didnt want any of them
youre what i want
now what do you want to do about it
sexy lets get naked
she takes him by the hand and crosses into the other bedroom
rick and debbie enter
to their surprise they find a man wearing a leather mask tied to the bed and happily licking desirees boots which she dangles in front of him
she also holds a whip over his head
despite the mask there is something very familiar about his face and the white powder encrusted all over his nose
debbie picks up on this immediately
sure enough mr
thomerson looks up and grimaces knowing hes been caught with his bondage down
he tries to say something but the boot in his mouth prevents anything intelligent from coming out
of course sir
that explains it
leather is a very good source of vitamin e
the party has reached fever pitch
suddenly police sirens pierce through the party sounds
we hear the hotel manager beating on the door with his fists
the manager is pounding on the door
by his side are several youre all under arrest
to everyone in the room your attention please
may i be the first to say its a raid
everyone starts to panic and run for the doors
continuing im glad no one is panicking
he snaps up his clothes from the bedroom
to police break it in boys
the cops rear back for a run at the door
at that moment the hotel door opens up and the cops and the manager are trampled by rick debbie mr
thomerson ricks gang other guests and assorted hookers
they run down the stairs
the cops pick themselves up and give chase
the manager looks inside the room and is devastated by what he sees
hiroshima looked better after the a bomb
we see the police have collared bobbie phoebe mrs
thomerson and the other ladies of the shower as hooker suspects
our bachelor party mob now charges down the stairs and out the hotel doors
the cops grab mr
thomerson as he tries to get out and they throw him in line with the others
unfortunately for him hes standing next to mrs
what are you doing here
before he can answer mrs
thomerson checks out his shocking leather outfit
the phone made me do it
shocked youve been having strange sex
no brett i
its all right
proudly so have i
he is totally blown away by this as the cops lead them out of the room
ive seen another mans diddly
our people pile out of the hotel
rick debbie and all ricks friends run down the street
suddenly a porsche pulls up between rick and debbie
he reaches over and pulls debbie into the car with him
cole what the hell are you doing
he drives off
hes kidnapped her
everyone into the bus
they all board the bus
as cole rounds a corner a tire comes loose and rolls off the car thanks to chulos shoddy workmanship
shit shit shit shit shit
he looks to the rear and sees ricks bus not far behind them
suddenly he spots something o
he grabs debbie and runs a city maintenance truck is driving slowly down the center of the street
a man in the back of the truck is leisurely placing orange cones in the center line of the road
cole with debbie in tow grabs the trucks driver and hauls him out of his seat
he then places debbie inside the truck and him at the wheel
he peels out
our man with the cones in the back is unaware of what has happened
he keeps placing the cones on the street
however now the truck is hitting speeds in the upper s
the mans leisure pace speeds up
he rapidly places cones on the road at break neck speed
rick is plowing into the cones and knocking them all over
our man with the cones is almost completely exhausted
rick is in pursuit knocking over cones
hes almost caught up with cole
the vehicles reach the top of the hill
cole grabs a sharp left and pulls into a movie theater parking lot
the maneuver loses rick for a second
rick jams on the brakes and doubles back into the parking lot
cole pulls up with a screech in front of the theater
he grabs debbie and jumps out of the truck
he drags her into the theater entrance
rick brings his bus to a stop and he and the gang pour out of the bus
he and debbie stand outside the theater which is a multi plex cinema
fourteen movie theaters under one roof
prominent is a sign which reads hour d festival
cole drags debbie into one of the theaters
the gang runs up to the theaters
fan out and look for them
they all go running into various theaters
he approaches a theater and sees the title of the movie playing inside
aw ive seen this one already
rick chooses a theater and goes inside
the patrons are wearing their d glasses watching the action on the screen
on the movie screen we see a man and a woman arguing
cole and debbie enter the theater
they run down to the front of the screen heading for an exit
he gives chase and catches up with cole
he takes a swing at cole and cole swings back
behind them on the screen a man has come to the rescue of the woman
a fight starts in the movie also
the patrons sit calmly watching the action
miraculously ricks fight with cole is in perfect sync with the actors in the movie
rick hits cole with a punch that sends him backwards into several movie patrons
the patrons are impressed by the realism of the films special effects
cole throws a punch
the punch hits a man in the front row in the mouth
to lady next to him gee what a realistic effect
yeah like youre in the movie with them
rick climbs over several rows and continues to pummel cole
cole grabs a womans purse and begins to hit rick with it
cole runs out of the aisle as rick climbs over people and dives onto cole knocking him to the aisle
to his date best d ive ever seen
as the movie ends rick has cole by the collar and is dragging him out of the theater
rick exits the theater with cole
he tosses cole to chulo
debbie comes running behind rick
to debbie are you okay
this has been quite a night
heres a thought
why dont we go home and give our private parts a workout
hugging him youre so romantic
the patrons are exiting
all of them are very up and excited by their d experience
a man who has taken a punch and has had his jacket ripped to shreds doesnt seem pleased
ive seen better
its another gorgeous day on the bluff overlooking the ocean
just right for rick and debbies wedding
we see the wedding in progress
the area is adorned with flowers
the many guests are seated and taken in the moment
among these are tracey desiree and garys she man who waves to gary as he stands with the other ushers chulo ryko and larry
chulo is choked up and trying to hide his tears
he looks over at laverne who smiles to him
to ryko hey man dont forget my bachelor partys next friday night
ill get the hookers
nearby stand the maids of honor bobbie phoebie and ilene who blows a kiss to her date ray one of the japanese businessmen
the thomersons sit in the front row
neither of them is cherishing this moment
sotto to mrs
thomerson well have morons for grandkids
resigned to the fact but
at least well have grandkids
they sort of smile at each other at the thought
father falwell is almost through with the ceremony
a car pulls up in the b
exiting the car is stan and a woman
oneill the best man sees the car
he pokes rick
he indicates to rick someone has arrived
we see the man in the car is stan
he ushers the lady in the car to larry
hes surprised at who she is his wife
howd you get here
rick called me
larry looks to rick and gives him a warm smile and a wave
rick acknowledges larry
why dont we go someplace and talk
they walk off
now before i pronounce you man and wife the groom wishes to recite his vow to debbie
they fear the worst
oh god almighty
he turns to debbie
he waits a beat and begins
i love you more than cheese
and i love cheese a lot
they hide their faces in their hands
off in the distance a storm is coming in fast over the ocean
the wind begins to pick up
undaunted rick continues his soliloquy
in fact more than dairy products in general
i love dairy
my love is cream
pour me on the cereal of your life
now it starts to rain
he wants this to end
he calls softly to rick trying to get his attention
people begin to scurry for cover
in the b
under a tree we see larry and his wife huddled in each others arms
from the way they look they have worked things out
i think this song pretty much sums up the way i feel at this moment
he begins to sing the theme from the flintstones with all the gusto of jack jones
father falwell has had enough
rapid fire i now pronounce you man and wife
he blesses them lightning fast and springs for his car
credits roll as rick continues to sing in the driving rain
debbie joins in on the chorus
she loves her man
everyone has run for the safety of their cars
everyone but the thomersons who sit and look on bewildered
flintstones meet the flintstones theyre a prehistoric family from the town of bedrock theyre a page right out of history
