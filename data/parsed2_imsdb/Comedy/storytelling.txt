href b b storytelling by todd solondz by todd solondz final draft title card fiction the time is circa
vi and marcus finish making love
marcus has cerebral palsy
hey you want to hear my short story now
lifts a ms from a shelf by his bed i can read it to you
you mean again
well i changed the ending a little
what happens now
well actually its the same but longer
i think its better
well then maybe you should just read the ending
but it wont make any sense if you hear it out of context
i think you should leave it the way it was
it was good
so you dont want to hear my new ending
youll read it in class tomorrow
beat anyway i have to go
i promised melinda id help her with her oral
she rises starts dressing
youre tired of me
i can tell
marcus im tired
youve lost interest
you hardly even sweat any more when we have sex
i was never much of a sweater
you know that
look vi i dont blame you
you feel you feel pity now
the pleasure isnt there any more
the kinkiness has gone
youve become kind
it is bright and sunny
mr scott who is black presides over his class
marcus is reading from his story vi at his side
catherine a stunning intellectual sits near the teacher
the rest of the students amy elli etc
listen closely and take notes
but when he saw her
it was as if he could walk like a normal person
his legs didnt swing his arms didnt spaz away
he wasnt a freak any more for she made him forget his affliction
no more cerebral palsy
from now on cp stood for
he was a cerebral person
marcus and vi exchange looks
i thought it was really good marcus
really moving and emotional
yeah i thought it was really emotional too
and i mean really good word choices
it kind of reminded me a little of faulkner but east coast and disabled
or flannery oconnor
she had multiple sclerosis
he was blind
updike has psoriasis
maybe im wrong but um im afraid i found the whole thing to be a little trite
its earnestness is well
its a little embarrassing
and those adjectives theyre a little flatfooted
im sorry but
anyway what do i know
dont even listen to what i say
catherine is right
the storys a piece of shit
you express nothing but banalities and formally speaking are unable to construct a single compelling sentence
you ride on a wave of cliches so worn in fact it actually approaches a level of grotesquerie
ad your subtitle the rawness of truth is that supposed to be a joke of some sort
or are you just being pretentious
beat then checking his class book ok
marcus upset rushes outside vi in pursuit desperately trying to console
marcus wait up
what do you want
dont be so upset
what the fuck are you talking about
beat you know he hated my story also
your story was terrible
he moves on she keeps up with him
youll write something better next time
if you had just been honest with me in the first place i wouldnt have read it
i knew it was shit
i believed you
thats not fair
i was honest
just because i wasnt sucking up like that bitch catherine
well i sure didnt hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered
i admit it i was scared
i was shocked in fact by what he said
and hes so
im sorry if i let you down but really i still say hes just one opinion
i dont even like his books that much
theyre all so aggressively confrontational
i dont care if hes won the pulitzer prize
catherine and mr scott walk by together in the distance
you just want to fuck him
like catherine and every other white cunt on campus
he leaves her
melinda lies on her bed with some homework watching vi
on phone but marcus
you cant just unilaterally decide to end things
this is a relationship were talking about
you dont just
she hangs up and enters her bedroom in tears
vi contd fuck him
are you ok
im totally ok
melinda rises puts a hand on her shoulder
you did the right thing
i know that
why do i waste my time with undergrads
theyre all so
i just thought marcus would be different
i mean hes got cp
what are you gonna do now
go to a bar
dont worry about me
ill be fine
she starts changing into a new outfit
students hang around outside
vi goes inside
vi walks up to the bar
can i have a beer
after getting her beer vi turns around and suddenly notices mr scott who is sitting alone
she goes over to him
vi contd hi
what are you doing here
what are you doing here
i didnt mean i just didnt expect to run into you here thats all
well now you have
vi laughs sort of ten blushes
yeah um then
are you alone
can i join you
mr scott gestures for her to sit down with him
vi contd gee thanks
i just wanted to say that im really happy with the class and um
i know you must here this all the time but im also a great admirer of your work
a sunday lynching especially
really um spoke to me
god i hope im not embarrassing you
beat cause i
i really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was
and i also agreed with what you said today about marcuss story
it is a piece of shit
you have beautiful skin
beat so catherine seems like she might become a really good writer
arent you going out with catherine
beat im sorry
its none of my business
i didnt mean
im not going out with catherine
beat do you think i have a potential as a writer
thank you for being honest
mr scott leans over and touches her hand
i have so much respect for you
mr scott and vi walk together in silence
vi and mr scott enter
he turns around and looks at her
can i just freshen up for a second
he indicates the direction of the bathroom
its over there
vi enters locks the door behind her
she looks at herself in the mirror then notices a snapshot of catherine she is naked legs open wide
other erotic photographs lie beneath catherines
to herself almost chanting dont be a racist
dont be a racist
dont be a racist
vi emerges from the bathroom to find mr scott lounging on the bed
its a really nice place you have
is the rent high
take off your top
take off the rest
she does and he looks hard at her
finally he rises
he starts making love to her from behind
mr scott contd whispers say nigger fuck me
i cant say that
fuck me hard
fuck me hard
say nigger fuck me hard
nigger fuck me hard
nigger fuck me hard
lights are out
marcus looks in the mirror ponders his reflection
there is a soft knock at the door
he turns away from the mirror and opens it
vi is there teary eyed disheveled
can i come in
vi finishes reading her story to the class
so john flipped her around and slammed her against the wall
jane braced herself she thought about her mother
she thought about peter
she thought about god
say fuck me nigger
fuck me hard
johns flesh abraded her soft skin
there would be marks
she acquiesced and said what he asked her to say and did what he asked her to do
she had entered college with hope with dignity but she would graduate as a whore
why do people have to be so ugly
write about such ugly characters
i know you all think im being prisssy but i dont care
i was brought up in a certain way
and this is
yeah well it did seem a little affected
like by using taboo language you were trying to shock us about the hollowness of your characters
i think it was a little bit racist
it was completely racist and beyond that i felt deeply offended as a woman
as if a woman can only operate from experiences of objectification
and so weirdly misogynistic
i mean why does jane go through with this
is she stupid
hey but wasnt this a rape
or did i miss something
because i im confused
because if this was a rape then why would she be a whore
beat it was confessional yet dishonest
jane pretends to be horrified by the sexuality that she in fact fetishizes
she subsumes herself to the myth of black male potency but then doesnt follow through
she thinks she respects afro americans she thinks theyre cool exotic what a notch he d make in her belt but of course it all comes down to mandingo cliche
and he calls her on it
in classic racist tradition she demonizes then runs for cover
but then how could she behave otherwise
shes just a spoiled suburban white girl with a benneton rainbow complex
its just my opinion and what do i know
but i think its a callow piece of writing
callow and coy
jane wants more but isnt honest enough to admit it
in the end she returns to the safety of her crippled translation sexually impotent boyfriend
this is bullshit
her story was the truth
but it happened
i dont know about what happened vi because once you start writing it all becomes fiction
still it certainly is an improvement over your last story there is now at least a beginning a middle and an end
a lower east side tenement apartment
a dogma poster hangs above the bed
toby down and out and in his thirties leafs through his high school yearbook
he reads an inscription toby i just know youre going to become a movie star
please dont forget me when you make it to the top
i will always love you pam
he picks up his phone and dials
hello is this pam
who is this
how are you
how are you
so whats going on
thats what i was gonna ask you
oh yeah well
i was just calling because well i was wondering if you still remembered me which i guess you do
look at where we are the year
can you believe it
i mean did you ever think we would actually make it
um well yeah
beat so are you still acting
oh no not any more
no um i kind of came to terms with myself i realized i had done what i had to do
and it was time to move on
so what did you do after you gave up on acting
well i went to law school if you can believe that
mike tobys roommate and cameraman enters looking for a towel then goes to take a shower
i believe it
yeah well it was really all kind of a joke and a rip off so uh
so i dropped out
oh thats too bad
yeah well then it got me writing so that was a good thing
anything i might know about
well um i kind of let things go on this novel id been really into i mean the whole publishing industry is totally corrupt
i mean really its finished
thats too bad
i worked over at a homeless shelter for a while drove a cab to pay the rent but i mean that was like i mean i have some dignity
so then what do you do now
im a documentary filmmaker
anything i might have seen
n not yet
im hoping to get a grant for this one project on teenagers
geez remember when we were teenagers
you didnt wanna take me to the prom
oh i dont remember that
well but it was so long ago
we were so different back then
uh well anyway so im looking for subjects for this documentary on teenage life in suburbia
kind of an exploration of the mental psyche of its mythology
i wrote to derrida to see if hed like to do the narration
but everythings still kind of in development at this point
toby beat i work in a shoe store right now
but its cool
im not ashamed
i mean really i have a much stronger sense of self now
and uh anyways its really very temporary
so anyway tell me
what about you
id heard through the grapevine you were producing movies
but not any more
tired of life in the fast lane
so youre um
how old are they
eight six and four
wow that really is great
in a few years who knows maybe theyll want to be in my documentary
listen toby i cant really talk right now
do you mind if i call you back
to himself after pause maybe she has caller id
it is bright and shiny
do you have any hobbies
scooby seventeen and mr demarco the guidance counselor sit opposite each other
no not really
any books you like to read for fun
none at all
how about those underground comics
i hate reading
beat all right scooby lets not beat around the bush
with your attitude youre not going to get in anywhere
so you just dont care
beat let me ask you not as your guidance counselor but
as a friend what do you want to do with your life
i mean what kind of long term goals can you possibly have
talk to me
tell me what youre thinking
well i mean
i wanna be on tv
maybe have a talk show or something
or early letterman
and how is it you hope to achieve this goal
see if i have any connections
the sprinkler system is still on
the family is sitting waiting at the table fern scoobys attractive mother marty his bullish father brady sixteen his handsome jock brother and mikey ten his smart youngest brother
consuelo the maid brings some bread to the table
did you knock on his door
yes but he just shouted at me and used the f word
would anyone be interested in being hypnotized after dinner
lets just start
i dont know whats wrong with that kid
maybe hes gay
dont ever say that
what if he is
marty ignore him
hes vegetarian doesnt do sports
and even if he is
gay people are people too you know
youre just being prejudiced
i dont care is hes gay
i mean its not like i have to share his room or anything
i just want to know what the hell hes doing in his room thats so interesting he doesnt come down for dinner
maybe hes building a bomb
dont even joke about that
what happens if he blows up the school
a tense pause followed by a distant crushing sound
im going in there
was anyone in my room today
is everything ok
my cd case like totally collapsed
im gonna have to recatalogue all weekend
sitting down hey
can you pass the salad over
beat steaks really good tonight
got a lot of homework
whaddya mean you dont know
you either got a lot or you dont
whats not to know
beat you started filling out your college applications yet
im not going to college
what are you going to do
what do you know
dad im trying to figure things out right now ok
its like really hard and im just listening to some old elton john and
brady mouths gay
leave the table
you heard me leave the table
rising man i am out of here
this family is so fucked
mom its not fair if brady can say the f word and i cant
yeah well mikey listen up
cause heres a lesson lifes not fair
a red sports car drives up front
esposito bradys buddy drops off brady and cheryl bradys cheerleader girlfriend
a cleaning woman walks along the sidewalk on her way to the bus stop
ill talk to you later man
brady still in his football outfit tracks in some dirt
cheryl follows him to his room giggling
mikey sits on the sofa while consuelo continues her housework
do you have any brothers or sisters
four brothers and five sisters
beat why did your parents have so many children
i mean if they were poor wouldnt it be better to have just one or two
it was gods will
but do you really believe in god
and heaven hell and angels and all kind of stuff
the livingstons are eating dinner
how was school today
same as what
just the same
a tense pause
were studying the holocaust in social studies
we did the same thing last year also
how was the class
well im supposed to watch schindlers list for homework
the movies like almost four hours
and then im supposed to write a report on survivors
to marty you know any survivors dad
do i know any
well technically your zeda is a survivor
he was in a concentration camp
but he had to escape the nazis
but i thought he came over to america before the war
well he did
with his family
but his cousins they had to stay and they were all killed
and if hed stayed he would have been killed
so in my book hes a survivor
even though it was only his cousins that were killed
but that couldve happened to him
or to me if id been alive
you mean then were all survivors
if it hadnt been for hitler he wouldnt have had to leave europe
we would have been
but then in a sense since you would never have met dad if your family had stayed in europe
if it werent for hitler none of us would have been born
a long pause
get the hell outta here
rising man its just like conversation
toby sits across from mr kirk
tell me you make a living at this
im actually not doing this for the money
when you make a documentary you do it for many reasons but money is certainly not one of them
i dont get it
well sir a lot has happened to the landscape of the suburban high school since i was a student and i feel it would be a valuable perhaps even enlightening
endeavor to chronicle the changes to get intimate with the realities kids and parents face in american schools today
yeah well whatever
ill let you know if theres interest
toby pauses by the receptionist before leaving
excuse me wheres the bathroom
toby rushes to the urinal
scooby is sitting in a corner smoking a joint observing him
toby smells the pot turns and smiles at him
you a pervert
actually im a documentary filmmaker
you mean like blair witch project
im doing one on high school students in fact
its kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of columbine
is this to like get into sundance
yeah well its possible they would be interested in it
actually there is some interest from the sundance channel
hbo and mtv have also shown some interest
so you have connections
the lights are on
you see were trying to do a film on suburban lifestyles
toby sits in the living room surrounded by the livingston family
marty fingers a card that reads toby oxman documentarian
his address and phone number are printed below
kind of an american family for the new millennium
i thought this was about kids getting into college
oh it is
i mean which is it
you gotta keep your focus straight
youre absolutely right
the focus is on the college admissions process today
and you want scooby to be the focus of all this
scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds
oh well i dont have them yet but either scooby is the focus or forget it
yeah i thought i was the focus
i wanna be the focus
brady slaps him
toby we need this to be a positive experience
well i suppose i could reconceive
cause scooby does have a quality that ive been looking for a quality that is emblematic of american today
its part disillusionment part hope
consuelo comes in with tea and twinkies
boys take napkins
not to be crass but what do we get out of this
laughs dont worry he doesnt mean money
oh i know i know that
well sharing your story your ups and downs and so forth can i hope be an illuminating experience
how do we know we wont be exploited
no its true
mr livingston i fully understand and i share your concerns
you fell vulnerable
and i know that this is a very difficult question but what it comes down to is can you make a leap of faith in me in the same way
that i have to make a leap of faith in you
big esposito in football attire surrounded by brady and other athletes talks to toby
kids whip towels at each other in the background
this is a great school
i dont care what anybody says
i mean its not perfect but like the people are really cool like the teachers and kids
they really care and all
and i know that they make fun of new jersey all the time but i dont care
cause theyre just snobs
cause jersey is where americas at
walking down these hallways just like the ones i once walked down as a teenager i couldnt help thinking back to a time when every day i woke up depressed
suicidal consumed by despair
had things changed
was the competition to get into the most prestigious schools still a requisite rite of passage
beneath these masks of courtesy and friendliness i knew that there were darker forces at work
and i knew that scooby was the key to revealing the truth
scooby scooby scooby
what are you thinking
college sats your parents your brothers your friends
how is it you deal with all this stress
a school psychologist sits at her desk
the pressure to get into the college of your choice is incredible
you know they did a study recently of the youth in bosnia during the bombing and they found that the stress the young people experienced there was less than what
american high school students go through when applying to college
is that right
oh my god
toby and his editor examine the footage on an avid
so whaddya think
well im not really sure what youre trying to say
its funny i suppose
but it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are
im not making fun
im showing it as it really is
youre showing how superior you are to your subject
no but i like my subject
i like these people
no you dont
yes i do
i love them
the cameraworks nice
ill tell mike
beat well its still just a beginning
i know i can
it is bright and sunny
fern is in the kitchen talking on the phone
she has a list of names and notes in front of her
consuelo dusts in the background
toby and mike stand nearby with a video camera recording everything
but marj may i call you marj
what it really boils down to is
what does it mean to be a jew
and the new wing at beth israel is
well actually last year you gave
but this year would not only be a mitzvah it would bring you to a new level
yes of course
your gift would also give you a chagall menorah and two tickets to the dinner dance this spring
because its true israel needs us now
if not now when
well thats wonderful
ill speak to you next week
she hangs up just as scooby walks inside fresh from school
how was school today
ready for tomorrow
the sats knucklehead
im not taking them
he walks off
the family is eating dinner
there is a tense silence finally broken by mikey
i was looking through scoobys sats practice books this afternoon and i took one of the practice tests
guess what score i got
and im only in fifth grade
everyone turns to glare at him
scooby is brushing his teeth when marty enters
we have to talk
whaddya wanna talk about
dont screw around with me
you know what im talking about
beat youre taking those sats
youre taking those sats or your cd collection is history
youre taking those sats and youre going to college
youre taking those sats if i have to strap your ass to a chair but buddy your taking them
under his breath as he starts walking away tired of this shit
toby and mike shoot footage of the students as they take their sats
scooby is filling out his sat in such a way that he creates a pattern of filled blanks that spells fuck this shit
toby and mike are interviewing brady and cheryl in the driveway
off to the side mikey tries hypnotizing a cat
so are you surprised that scooby took the sats after all
hes kind of a wuss
how about you cheryl
were you surprised
hey how come you drive such a shitty car
joins their laughter i dont know
thats interesting though
a cool car
is that something thats real important to you brady
scooby handles a gun his friend stanley has given him
pretty cool stanley
howd you get it
its my dads he hides it under some old tv guides in his closet
gee your dads smart
is it loaded
no i dont think so
scooby points it at his head
im not an idiot man
i watch tv
a little nervous i dont know why
you should be
scooby points it at stanley gets a terrified reaction then tosses the gun aside
you can keep it
he lies down
i like you
beat do you think that youd let me
if you feel like it
just give me a second
he pulls a bag of mushrooms out from beneath his night table takes some and offers to stanley
you want some
scooby flicks on a cd then lies down
while stanley goes down on scooby the camera pans away from scooby to reveal marty and fern being burned at the stake in the front yarn writhing and screaming in
im so sorry
i should never have made you take the sats
the camera then pans to reveal conan obrien approaching
hows it going
what are you doing here
im looking for a last minute guest for my show
ill be your guest
well all right
lets take a look at the television and see how we look
the camera pans to reveal a tv standing on the lawn
conan turns on the tv and we move inside it to see conan and scooby sharing some talk show patter and repartee
welcome to the show scooby
nice to have you here
great to be here
and thank you for dressing up for us
this is very classy
what kind of professional plans do you have
whats in your future
well i was thinking
i might work for you
what do you want to do for me
whats your idea
be your sidekick you know and maybe eventually become a tv talk show host
tv talk show host ok
you were at sidekick eight seconds ago then tv talk show host
youll be a latin dictator in a bout a minute
lets see what they think of the first idea
im curious what the audience thinks
folks what do you think should scooby be my new sidekick
scooby new sidekick everybody
bigger round of applause
scooby has spaced out while flossing
there is a knock at the door
theres something i need to talk about with you
there are some rumors
and like dont take this the wrong way
i mean im cool
ive got a good reputation at school and well
i really dont want it ruined
he is visibly upset
a football scrimmage is in progress
a play ends and the coach comes on to the field barking esposito what the fuck do you think youre doing
youre tackling like a bitch on my football team son
you gotta bend your ass over and hit somebody
you understand me
you understand me
then do it
thats the way to hit that hole son
brady waves a cheryl in the stands
were gonna become a football team today guys
lets move the ball
i wanna see you hit those holes
defense fill those goddam gaps
lets go guys
lets do it
on the next play brady runs to catch a pass but is moved down by esposito shouting kill him
cheryl jumps up alarmed
cheerleaders finish their go bucks
cheer but brady doesnt rise
brady lies unconscious in bed hooked up to machines
marty fern scooby and cheryl stand around him
mikey sits at the kitchen table with consuelo
he is eating ice cream
when im in high school im not going to play any football
im just going to concentrate on class rank
beat what did you do in high school
i did not go to high school
werent there high schools in el salvador
we had to work
my family was poor
mustve been hard being poor
im still poor
beat but consuelo even though your poor dont you have any hobbies or interests or anything
but like what do you like to do when youre not working
im always working
but when youre not
what do you like to do
this is work
but its not like real work
this is just babysitting
consuelo stares hard at him in silence
you know your jobs really not so bad if you think about it
you should smile more often
driving along the neighborhood shots a lam post a sign a floating straw wrapper
when the sky is clear and the sun is warm youre reminded of how beautiful things can be a lamp post a sign a straw wrapper blowing in the wind
but when that dark cloud appears you realize how fragile the balance of life is
the neurologist dr barry jordan discussing bradys condition when brady first arrived at the hospital he was unresponsive to verbal stimuli
wee performed a ct scan which demonstrated a large subdural hemotoma with mass effect
since the removal of the subdural hes been in coma
a psychologist discussing the effect of the brady crisis on his family when i first met the livingstons it was in the first twenty four hours of brady coming in
after his tragic football accident and they were acting in a fairly typical way
the livingstons consulting with dr goodman in a hospital waiting room were not the ones who need the help
my son needs help
and you my sons in there
he cant even feed himself he cant eat i dont even know if hes going to be a vegetable or not for chrissake
the picture freezes and then zooms into a close up on scooby
but what about scooby
how would this effect him
what meaning is to be found in this
toby and his editor finish watching this latest footage
this is definitely better
you think so
you dont think that this might not be a little dry
this is entertainment youre making toby
this story about a kid in the suburbs and the state of the college admissions process has with this brady crisis evolved into something much richer and more provocative
yes i know
but still it should be somewhat entertaining
i mean without this footage without this rigorous documentation it would feel like exploitation
no no no
this is serious
but dont you find it a little funny too at the same time
youve got a family tragedy on your hands
will you tell me whats funny about that
about a kid in a coma
nothing i guess
i mean why are you making this documentary if you cant treat your subject with appropriate gravity
ok youre right youre right
beat you know we need to screen what weve got
invite some regular people just some random off the street types
and see what real people think of this
i dunno toby
we really have a long way to go
you still need a lot more footage and its probably a little premature to start screening
ok then we can invite serious intellectual types
were not ready
hip alternative types who will understand the process better
were not ready
well i need to see this with an audience
whats an audience going to tell you
i dont know
maybe theyll like it
mikey opens the refrigerator takes out a bottle of grape juice pours a cup for himself then accidentally spills it all on the floor
i spilled some grape juice on the floor
mikey goes downstairs finds her alone in her bedroom
she appears to be upset
are you crying
yes you are
i can tell
whats the matter
mi jesus esta muerto
consuelo im sorry but you know if you dont speak english i cant understand you
who is jesus
you have a bay
my grandchild baby
gee i didnt even know you had any children
but why are you so upset about jesus
how did it happen
he was executed
he was on death row and then he was executed
how did they execute him
beat maybe its for the best
i mean if he was guilty of doing something wrong
people who are bad should be killed
dont you think so
jesus was not bad
maybe he was and you just didnt know it
but still you cant be sure
i am sure
but really you never know
beat why was he on death row
for rape and murder
consuelo what is rape exactly
beat it is when you love someone and they dont love you
and then you do something about it
sometimes i feel like my parents dont love me
well then when you get older you can do something about it
a long pause
i spilled some grape juice upstairs
do you think you could clean up the floor now
marty and mikey sit by the comatose brady who lies now in his own bed
do you think that brady will ever get better
one in a million recover
maybe hes that one in a million
mikey theres optimism and then theres stupidity
its a very fine line
i dont think theres any hope either
i was just trying to make you feel better
would you let me try hypnotizing you now
sure go ahead
ill be right back
mikey hurries off to fetch his hypnotizing apparatus
marty sits and waits
just a sec
be right there
mikey returns sets himself up across from marty and takes out a shiny object
dad can you turn around a bit please
now you must look at this shiny object and concentrate
relax your legs
relax your arms
relax your shoulders
now keep your eyes on the shiny object
your eyelids are getting heavy
youre getting sleepy
now let your eyes close shut
and you are asleep
martys head drops
now you are completely under my power
i am the only voice you can hear the only voice you will listen to
when you wake up you will be in a good mood
you wont worry so much about brady
and i will be your favorite from now on
if brady dies you can be sad for a little bit but i will still be the most important person in your life
you will never be mean to me and always give me whatever i want
also you should fire consuelo
now when i snap my fingers you will remember nothing but you will do everything i have asked
mikey snaps his fingers and marty wakes up
you wanna get some ice cream
a couple of maids are walking by with white babies in strollers
so like yeah
i caved in
i mean i had to
my parents theyre like still really depressed about brady
so i wrote the bullshit essay
filled out the applications did the interviews
yknow i figure i can always drop out
so whered you get in
beat but what did you get on your sats
kinda weird i know
but i think they thought it was like good weird
marty and fern sit on the sofa
we used pull
you know you have to
sometimes you just have to toby
but what kind of pull did you have
i have a cousin
very big giver to the alumni fund
its all about who you know
look were not suckers
everyone else is out there doing the same thing

i need to speak alone with consuelo for a moment
he runs up the stairs pretends to disappear but stays to observe
livingston and i have discussed this and weve come to the conclusion that we are not very happy with your work lately so were going to let you go
i i dont understand
weve been happy with you in the past but now we think maybe its time for a change
i know youve had trouble at home and maybe you know some of that is reflected i your work
but mr livingston i work very hard for you and your family
i understand i understand that and im sorry it had to end this way
consuelo exits the house and trudges towards the bus stop carrying all her belongings
other cleaning women are waiting for the bus as well

he goes into the screening room
of the documentary being screened
marty talks to toby poolside as he prepares a barbecue
i think scoobys like a lot of kids
he just hit a
a speed bump
now hes gonna find his way his path is gonna be cleared and i think hes gonna continue his education at a good college
and everybody else is gonna be happy
but mr livingston arent you a bit fearful that scooby will be confronted with hollow values and systemic conformism
i dont know why this is so hard for you to comprehend
i had a terrific time in college
ive got a terrific job a comfortable salary terrific wife three terrific kids
and every year i give to the alumni fund
now why are you trying to make college out to be a bad thing a negative experience
you were unhappy
well to bad
get over it
stop trying to impose your misery on others by going around saying life is bad life is horrible
life is tough on you
well boo hoo
scooby talks to toby in the backyard marty seen in the distant background
well yeah my dad is kind of a goofball
i just have to pretend to go along with his ideas
cause he really doesnt get it like i could be the next oprah for all he knows but hes never even seen the show
watching himself on screen as he continues talking to toby
what is most important to you
id like to be good at something
it doesnt have to be tv
i mean it could be movies
id be willing to direct
the audience laughs
but id like to be you know
not necessarily a superstar just famous

still talking to toby
uh scooby now i understand how you want to be a tv talk show host and all like conan obrien but did you know even he went to college

watching the film and listening to the audience
the laughter is out of control
he is devastated
marty and fern are in bed watching the news
mikey appears in the doorway

mikey gets in bed with them
snug as a bug in a rug

consuelo approaches the house stealthily
opening the back of the house stuffing towels under bedroom doors turning on the kitchen stoves gas switching on the main gas valve in the boiler room
a very long pause
scooby gets off the bus with a few cleaning women
he walks homewards
scooby sees reporters policemen firemen ambulances gas company vehicles and neighbors surrounding his house
toby and mike suddenly appear with their camera trained on him
