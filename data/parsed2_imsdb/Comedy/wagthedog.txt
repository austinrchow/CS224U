guess who am
id like to mention a few names who
i know who you are mr
i was acting as a private citizen
nothing that ive done should be construed as reflecting on the orders or intentions of anyone with whom you may have reason to believe i am connected with
or in whose employ quite touching
and i take this opportunity to suggest that equally i admit to nothing and that i would like my lawyer present
we show and n
confirms there are no nuclear devices on the canadian border
there are no nuclear devices in albania
zat put us in something of a pickle
albania has no nuclear capacity
our spy satellites show no secret terrorist camps in the albanian hinterland
and the border patrol and the r
report no repeat no untoward activity along our picturesque canadian border
the albanian government is screaming its innocence the world is listening
there is no war
course theres a war
im watching it on television
nwho might you be when alls said and done
my name is ronald brean
whore you working for
nobody whose name you want me to say mr
young i promise you
sall very well but when the fit hits the shan somebodys going to have to stay after school and who do you spose that might be
sonly got to hold for another few days
well im not interested in how long its got to hold for
what are you interested in
im interested in the security of my country mr
as are we all and id like to take this opportunity to suggest that the security of the country would be ill served by any any
any untoward revelation regarding uh
and i think that the security of the country would be best served by its citizens obeying its laws
gemme a federal judge gemme search warrants all premises controlled by our friends and bench warrants for the two of
well im sure that speaks very well of you and for your parents
but if forced to choose between the security of the country and the security of your job which would you pick
and while you hesitate permit me to suggest that they are one and the same
your country and your job
im doing my job mr
thats what you see me doing here
what is it you thought you were doing
and id like to point out that ive been on prescription medication the side effects of which
im doing my job too
would you give me a
do you think you could call off your dogs for a minute
whats on your mind
i have a question for you
why do people go to war
why do people go to war
ill play your silly game
why do they go to war
to preserve their way of life
would you go to war to do that
well i have too
would you do it again int that why youre here
i guess so nif you go to war again who is it going to be against
your ability to fight a two ocean war against who
sweden and togo who you sitting here to go to war against
that time has passed its passed its over the war of the future is nuclear terrorism it is and it will be against a small group of dissidents who unbeknownst
perhaps to their own governments have blah blah blah
and to go to that war youve got to be prepared you have to be alert and the public has to be alert
cause that is the war of the future and if youre not gearing up to fight that war eventually the axe will fall
nyoure gonna be out in the street
and you can call this a drill or you can call it job security or you can call it anything you like
but i got one for you you said go to war to protect your way of life well chuck this is your way of life
and if there aint no war you can punch out go home and take up oil painting
and there aint no war but ours
its just for eight more days
one more thing what is that river shes running across
the young girl in the video the albanian girl
shes running its some sacred
some ancestral land cloven by the brook named
give it to moss no were on top of it
no thank you i should be in nashville tell him im coming in
nice enogh people
they just hadnt thought it through
i was busy
yes i need the new poll fig
ill call in from nashville
and patch me through to the big bird will
ive got to hand it to you
they sure let us out of there easy
they just hadnt thought it through
midst repeated denial from the albanian government
while at the white house a sense of stillness pervades awaiting the return of
it aint hoarding
its stockpiling uh huh
only common sense
we got the guy we got the guy we got the guy
the canada thing was a shuck
a shuck wasted a day
what can you do with canada
bears mapleleafs sugar on snow
lays there on the plate like a lox
what what were breaking up ill call you from the studio

what is it
at the airport
cause we decided at the airport he hugs the fat wet albanian broad we
no no no no no after the airport
gotten word that the situation in albania is resolved
that it is resolved
my military sources confirm that our troops along the canadian border and overseas are standing down and i must take this opportunity to call upon our president to stand and
face the charges the heinous charges brought against him
you know folks there is nothing in life as precious as the innocence of a child
now i do not say these charges are true i do not see how they could be
accusations of of sexual misconduct in anyone must be investigated
in the case of a sitting president of one whose term and i do not hesitate to mention it ends in effectively in a matter of days
i call upon the president
what does he mean the situation has been resolved
he just got hip to us
he just ended the war
what are we gonna do about it
we guard the northern borders
we live the northern liiiiifffe
we come to restore order
for our children and our wiiiiiiiffee
tellem to knock it off
what are we going to do
the war is over
the war is over
senator nole just ended the war
well we started it he ended it
and the c
confirms the cessation of hostilities with
those limp dick
turncoat thought they let us out of there too easy
wars over pal
gloria sell the house
the war aint over
i saw it on tv
the war aint over til i say its over

you think youre in a spot you think this is a tight spot
try making the hunchback of notre dame when your three lead actors die two weeks from the end of principal photography
this is just
act one the war
act two the
its like those japanese in the caves on okinawa
didnt believe the war was over
you got a guy doesnt believe the war is

the threat of nuc ear terrorism has been quelled
we are in contaot with the albanian premier who assures me and this government credits his assurances that his country does not wish us ill and has not
that the threat which we perceived was not of his wish or of his making
of his making from whence did it come
our information states it came from a small group of armed dissidents
of armed and violent dissidents
but that group has been in the main subdued
now how did we come by this information
who subdued that group
it falls to me to reveal to you a secret to reveal the existence of a secret group of warriors
men yes and women trained and pledged their strength their skills and if called upon their lives in the service of their fellow americans
a group so secret its very existence has been known to just a few and known not by a name but by a designation number three oh three
anybcdy know latin
member of the group was left behind what were then enemy lines
and i can only say to those family members of group which members are i know as i speak gathering to comfort you the parents of the missing man i
can only say i need a latin motto anybody know ny latin and the albanian government joins with me that no i repeat no effort will be apared to find
this brave man and to bring him home
