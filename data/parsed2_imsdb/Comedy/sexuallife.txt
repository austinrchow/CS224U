written by ken kwapis draft from an aerial view we see the outline of a city
any city will do
mirrored high rises
sprawling apartment complexes
a lot of people live here
whoever they are
as we move closer we discover that this is not a real city at all but a scale model of one
everything is in miniature the buildings parks and freeways
gliding over this tabletop metropolis we find that none of the buildings have roofs allowing us to peak inside
we float through miniature coffee shops offices and bedrooms where toy figures are arranged in tableau of everyday life a man dines alone
a woman walks her dog
two kiss on the street
one waits for a bus
over this we hear marianne faithfuls smoky voiced cover of the standard when were alone just picture a penthouse way up in the sky with hinges on chimney for stars
to go by a sweet slice of heaven for just you and i when were alone
from all of society well stay aloof and live in propriety there on the roof two heavenly hermits well be in true when were alone
as the song ends we find a miniature girl who lies on a miniature bed
a cramped one room studio
asleep on a futon is a slender girl of nineteen lorna
her blood red toenails give the place its only color
an alarm clock rings its twelve noon
lorna uses her foot to turn it off
why did you let me sleep so late
lorna looks over to an empty pull out sofa its only occupant a skinny kitten
lorna contd contd terri
to the cat she must already be at work huh
the cat meows very non committal
still in her t shirt and panties lorna opens a can of cat food as the kitten looks on
she probably forgot what day it is right arthur
some friend she turned out to be
not like you
you remember what day it is dont you
off the cats blank stare im not giving you any food until you tell me
arthur the cat responds with a pitiful meow
lorna smiles and sets down the food
lorna contd contd thats right
i knew youd remember
lorna dressed casually walks to the bus stop
reading the crossword puzzle in the paper she doesnt see the curb and trips spilling her purse
embarrassed she gathers her things then takes a seat next to a latino woman
lorna smiles and resumes work on the puzzle
stumped by a clue she turns to the woman
simon and garfunkel hit
the woman shrugs and looks off
suddenly lornas phone rings
she reaches into her purse but its not there
then she spots it
in the street
but the moment she goes to get it a truck roars past and smashes it to smithereens
lorna contd contd oh my god
but as she scoops up the pieces in her hand a smile creeps across her face
lorna contd contd no this is right
this is exactly right
a few notches up from a greasy spoon
lorna sits at the counter stirring her coffee
a waitress approaches
excuse me whatever happened to that sign the one that used to hang next to the pies
the waitress looks over her shoulder
the one that said today is the first day of the rest of your life
we got rid of it
have you decided
before lorna can speak we hear shell have the steak and egg special
lorna turns as terri her roommate joins her at the counter
a little older than lorna terri is cute but a little dangerous
look at her she needs protein
lots of protein
to the waitress white toast
the waitress leaves
working early today huh
no i had something important to do
terri opens her bag and pulls out a small gift wrapped box
i knew youd remember
terri gives lorna a kiss on the lips
of course i remembered
go on open it
i wasnt born until ten minutes before midnight
and thats when ill open it
you better like it
i dont want to tell what i had to do to pay for it
it must be good
so whats the plan stan
something special today
other than splurging on toast
there is something
count me in
something ive been thinking about for a long time
terri sighs she knows exactly where this is going
i cant do this forever terri
lorna points to the corner of her eye
i know i keep talking about it but this time im going to do it
in fact i did it
this is my last day
i called them
i told them i was out
you did not
i have one more appointment
give me your cell phone
im calling them back right now
lorna smiles and pours the shattered remnants of her phone on the counter
a bus ran over it
isnt that perfect
its a perfect sign
terri pops a cigarette in her mouth as the waitress delivers the toast
to terri cant do that here miss
i know i know
im not going to light the damn thing
beat fuck me
look im good for next months rent
this takes terri by surprise
what youre leaving too
get out of town for a while
i really feel good about this
beat i appreciate everything youve done for me this year terri
i wish youd talked to me first
i didnt because
i knew youd try to talk me out of it
thats because im looking out for you
its because there is so much opportunity here
beat and its because im your friend
lorna fiddles with her toast
beat listen im late
lorna leaves some change on the counter picks up her gift and gives terri a hug
as lorna goes the waitress reappears
your friend comin back
hard to say
someone is flipping through a stack of wedding photos
festive shots of various couples
at the altar
cutting the cake
posing with relatives
were in a living room lorna sits on the couch browsing the wedding photos
she has a quizzical look as if the photos were of some incomprehensible alien culture
the apartment is cluttered but not dirty
the decor suggests an occupant of modest means and bohemian taste
the occupant is todd who enters counting a wad of money
by turns cocky and nervous
he sets the money in front of lorna
seventy five right
for the half hour
not including tip
todd paces uneasily
and typically the size of the tip is
depends on how generous you feel
this your first appointment
ive done this before
lorna thinks otherwise
she pats the seat next to her
come over here youre making me nervous
he plops down next to her
so how much extra do you feel like spending
i dont know
another fifty dollars
she thumbs through the wedding photos
so this is what you do
it pays the rent
these are good
youre really a good photographer
well somebody thinks so
i get a lot of work
and you can only spend another fifty on me
todd walked right into that one
lorna contd contd maybe youll feel more generous once you get to know me
her face has an open unguarded beauty
you have a great smile do you know that
yeah ive heard
and i like your name
like the cookie
gee ive never hear that one before
she laughs at him
but its not unkind
lorna contd contd i have a friend who makes photos
shes had some stuff in magazines
really dirty stuff though
worse than dirty
you probably wouldnt like it
hey im not afraid of sick images
in fact its what i aspire to do create pictures that are edgy that really assault you that reach out and slap you in the face
lorna considers this
i dont know
shake people out of their
your friend would understand
whats her work like
she photographs people pissing on each other
maybe thats the point
but who would want to look at that
i mean bathrooms have doors for a reason
what do you like
i like things that make me happy
lorna holds up a photo of a beautiful smiling bride
i bet shes going to have a very happy life
she lingers over the photo
i dont think im the marrying kind though
marriage its so
sometimes when im doing a wedding i look at the bride and groom and think what a couple of lemmings
im not sure people can be true thats all
lorna puts down the photos
now that weve gotten to know each better maybe we should get started
alone lorna prepares
she tears open a condom wrapper stares into the mirror and runs her lines
oh you really have a big cock
my you really have a big cock
god what a big cock you have
lorna and todd are having sex
shes on top her movements slow and hypnotic
occasionally lorna offers a moan some are more convincing than others
note throughout the scene our angles generally exclude todd from view
we may hear him but our focus is on as she goes about her work lorna wears a vaguely puzzled expressions
in fact puzzles are on her mind
forty two across
simon garfunkel hit
begins with i
im a loser
did they sing that
susie used to play moms simon garfunkel records all the time
i scratched one once and she pulled my hair
i havent spoken to her for almost a year
her little kid must be walking by now
maybe i should give susie a call
nah fuck that
shes perfectly capable of calling me
i mean im listed
i am a rock
i am a rock thats the answer
i am a suddenly lorna remembers the job at hand
flatly god you really have a big cock
like pavlovs proverbial dog todd moans and the whole thing is quickly over
lorna gives todd a look its an astonishing impersonation of tenderness
that was something
let me tell you
that was something
cut the modesty
you really know what youre doing
lorna dressed is dialing the kitchen phone
from the kitchen window she can see a school playground across the way
girls in uniforms perform a jump rope cadence
into phone hey its lorna
im clocking out for the last time
no im not done for the day im done
wait i dont think you heard me
well just give it to one of the other girls
give it to terri
i dont care if hes an important client i told you im
well youll just have to cancel it wont you
i dont care what it pays its not my fuckin she turns to find todd in the doorway listening
into phone hold on
to todd what
are you alright
the cab fare will be another twenty
you never said anything about cab fare
of course i did
are you calling me a liar
i swear you didnt say a word about it
lorna slowly brings the phone to her ear
into phone alright
where is it
todd is at the wheel of his vintage buick
lorna sits on the passenger side
she looks off distracted
on the seat between them is the gift from terri still unopened
you havent told me where were going yet
make a right at the light
can i ask you a question
without a beat no forget it
go on ask
well after we
after we did it you didnt really mean what you said did you
about me being so good
lorna looks at him like hes the biggest fool in the world
this is not lost on him
back peddling im only asking because im fascinated by this whole scene youre in
so dont worry about sparing my feelings or anything
im just curious
pull over here
up the block is a high rise luxury hotel
limos and cabs line the driveway
uniformed doormen guard the entrance
you see that hotel
in one of those rooms theres a man waiting
hes waiting for me
i dont know what his name is or what he looks like
he may have bad skin
he may be really ugly
but no matter how he looks or how bad he smells or whether he makes weird wheezing sounds when he comes i tell him the same thing
the same thing i told you
well thats what i thought
i mean a guy would have to be pretty lame to think that
todd knows better than to even finish
to think what
quite out of the blue she leans over and kisses him on the cheek
its todd right
well todd youre alright
beat and that i dont say that to everyone
she opens the door starts out if i wanted to see you again no
you cant see me again
beat but thanks for asking
lorna closes the door and starts for the hotel
todd drives past watching her recede in the rear view mirror
the moment she disappears todd looks down and sees the gift box from terri lorna left it on the seat
without missing a beat todd slams on the brakes jumps out and races back to where he left her
looking everywhere lorna
but lorna is gone
a business that specializes in sentimental portraits weddings graduations anniversaries
even beloved pets
a photo shoot in progress
todd and his colleague phil mid s are doing an engagement portrait
the couple very straight and suburban are just of out todd and phils earshot
to the couple beautiful just beautiful
to todd you used a rubber i hope
and how much did this afternoon delight set you back
about a buck and a quarter
to the couple we just need to reload
as they do since when do you have a hundred and twenty five dollars to throw away
im sure you spend just as much on porn rentals
theres no comparison
here ill do the math for you
phil pulls a calculator out of his camera bag
phil contd contd punching in numbers a video rents for
thats a two day rental
that means you can get off at least a couple times before its due
i can get off ninety four times for the same amount you paid to get off once
now tell me who gets the better deal
i cant argue with that
anyway i stopped watching porno
they kinda depress me
beat when i want to get off now you know what i use
phil taps his forehead
to the couple okay folks
its magic time
the couple is gone
phil and todd wrap some equipment
phil contd what i dont understand is arent you getting enough action from that sarah
whats sarah got to do with it
youre seeing her arent you
thats a whole different situation
but youre doing it with her right
i like sarah a lot
and i dont want to blow it by pushing too hard
you mean you havent
she wont put out
no no no
you dont get it
you cant equate the two
what i did with lorna lorna
thats her name
i mean thats the name she gave me
what i did with her
that was like going to some exotic place
for a visit
havent you ever wondered what that kind of person is like
what that world is like
i was just
the lower depths
beat you think im full of shit dont you
i didnt say anything
a revival house in a college neighborhood
the ticket seller hangs a sold out sign in the box office window just as todd and sarah come running down the sidewalk
sarah at twenty five is cute brainy articulate and hopelessly insecure
they lean against the wall and catch their breath
i am so sorry
i hear its really overrated
i could just kill him
this is not the first time hes done this either
cooked up some phony emergency right as im getting on the elevator
hes your boss
being an asshole is part of the job description
were talking about the most self centered man i have ever met
god forbid i should have a life right
beat but im not going to let him do it
ruin my evening
without a beat you know he also thinks hes gods gift to women
im surprised he hasnt been sued by now
he takes her by the shoulders
take a breath
im taking a breath
and she does
now take another one
i like you
have i told you that
you know what i want to do
i want to go shopping
for a house
completely thrown just what i was thinking
todd drives sarah through a neighborhood full of beautifully maintained old homes
she is a kid in a candy store look at the detail on that one
every one of these is a gem
makes the stuff i work on look pretty shabby by comparison
she shifts to get a better look
in doing so her foot hits an object on the floor
she lifts up lornas birthday gift still unwrapped
todd reacts he forgot to get rid of it and sarah reacts to todd
obviously not for me
somebody left in front the studio
i just picked it up
sarah nods she seems to buy it and promptly opens the box
what are you doing
maybe we can find out whose it is
inside is a silver bracelet and a hand written note
remember im in your corner
pretty cool bracelet
you just found this
stupid of me
i shouldve left it
thats a name you dont hear very much
like the cookie
off todds look what
youve never had a lorna doone
terri and lorna
lovers more like it
and this bracelet is some sort of talisman
you have a perverse mind
beat which i like by the way
perhaps terri killed lorna and this gift provides her with an alibi
maybe you should put it back
what arent you a little curious
todd pulls over and stops
i dont know how to put this
this is our fourth night out and i feel a lot of pressure
for this to work
i want it to work too
off his look oh
is this about sex
dont you think were being a little
methodical about the whole thing
maybe we should just
get it over with
dont you think its better to be sure of each other first
to have a little bit of trust
sarah absently fingers the bracelet thats not hers
you can trust me
i know i know
beat but youre not sleeping with anyone else right
of course not
its not such a strange thing to ask
i just need to feel i told you
you havent asked me if im seeing anyone
is that bad
its silly i know but it makes me feel like you couldnt imagine anyone being interested in me
you should be flattered i dont ask
i respect you enough to assume youd tell me if youre involved with someone
sarah considers this
ask me anyway
are you serious
off her look alright
are you seeing anyone
todd takes the bracelet puts it on the dash then leans to kiss sarah
i do want to make love tonight
im just worried that all this talk is going to kill the spontaneity she presses her finger to his lips i think spontaneity is overrated
todd and sarah are making out in her bedroom
to expedite matters theyre also trying to undress
its not very practical
todd cant quite kick off his shoes
sarah cant quite get her blouse unbuttoned
finally todd the light
he switches it off
they sit side by side and undress down to their underwear
they look at each other
dont say anything
what were you going to say
i wasnt going to say anything
you look beautiful no dont say that
lets get under the covers
they climb into bed and move into each others arms
lets go slowly
they kiss caress shedding their inhibitions
ive got one of those
whats the word
a bunion not a bunion
oh a foot spasm
here let me he throws back the covers and massages her foot
i hate this
what can we do
nothing its fine its fine
lemme just walk it off
she gets out of bed and hobbles into dressed in bra and panties sarah hops up and down the hall desperate to relieve her pain
todd appears in the doorway and watches her mad little dance
his thoughts she has a better looking body than i imagined
breasts are definitely bigger than i thought
you can just never tell with breasts can you
i dont know what to make of this foot problem
maybe she gets a spasm every time she has sex
ive heard of people with problems like that
people who cant have sex without laughing or burping
oh god what if shes one of them
sarah looks up from her hopping
i am so embarrassed
trust me this doesnt happen all the time
the thought never crossed my mind
sarah and todd back under the covers making love
todd is on top moving slowly
sarah bites her lip and closes her eyes
todd looks at her and wonders she wont look at me
why wont she look at me
ill bet shes preoccupied with her foot
shes praying she wont get another spasm another foot freak out
shes being awfully quiet too
why is she so quiet
maybe she needs to concentrate
some women need to concentrate
i read that in a magazine at the grocery store
that blonde check out girl who works there is really cute
i love the way she says paper or plastic
todd lets out an excited gasp
sarah opens her eyes with alarm
whats the matter
these walls theyre paper thin
this building is so poorly built
everyone can hear you
todd rolls off of her
is that why youre so quiet
yes the walls are
what are you saying
its hard for me to tell if youre enjoying this
of course i am
im sorry if im not vocal enough for you
thats not what i
sarah i just want to make sure im doing something right here
theres no right or wrong way to do this
i just want to make sure im
you know in the ballpark
sarah stares at him
todd i dont expect you to do everything right the first time
sorry that didnt come out the way i meant it
they roll away from each other and stare at the ceiling
we hear a distant siren a fire engine maybe
somewhere theres a five alarm fire blazing
you didnt like it
no i didnt say that
i was just
lets be still for a while
sarah and todd havent moved
its not clear how much time has elapsed
everyone expects fireworks the first time you do it
but thats just a myth
lets not be too hard on ourselves
our expectations were a little high thats all
todd nods his agreement
and at the end of the day sex is only one part of the picture
what do you mean
i know this couple
they had nothing in common but good sex
they went at it like a pair of rabbits
and guess how long it lasted
they were hot for each other
but there was nothing else
beat theres got to be something else
and they stare at the ceiling
they still havent moved but unbeknownst to sarah todd has fallen asleep
she looks at him
she caresses his face
then her hand slides down under the sheets
she tries to arouse him but after a while she stops
hes very much asleep
sarah lies back
she slides her hand between her legs and begins to touch herself
the air is cool and crisp as sarah wearing sweats and a t shirt jogs through the neighborhood
she turns down a side street heading for a nondescript house with a faded american flag hanging off the front porch
sarah climbs the steps where an elderly man her grandfather sits with the morning paper in his lap unread
sarah gives him a kiss
hows she doing today
dont pay her any mind sarah
the things she says they get stranger by the day
sarah pays him no mind and heads into the house
sarah and her grandmother sit on the back porch which offers a splendid view of
other peoples back porches
sarahs grandmother has a sense of mischief thats quite at odds with her deteriorating frame
the two drink coffee
they keep telling me im doing fine that im even improving
why do they have to lie
at my age
what are they trying to protect me from
maybe they know something you dont
she pulls out a pack of american spirit cigarettes and lights one
one in the morning with coffee
one at night with cocktails
where was i
beat oh yes
my story is coming to an end sarah oh please
your story thats the one i want to hear
i wish i had a story to tell
the last time there was talk of an admirer
all you want is dirt nan
the world is made of dirt sarah
so please dish
no detail is too small
im sleeping with two different men
one of them is a good man
hes good for me
the other one he can be a complete ass
a total jerk
in other words
he excites you
and i hate it
i hate him
and on top of that i cant have him
can you see your pappy
sarah looks back over her shoulder
she catches a glimpse of her grandfather
hes still on the front porch
he hasnt moved
keep an eye on him
because im going to tell you something he shouldnt hear
something no one knows
once i had two lovers
one was your grandfather
he had prospects then
he had a car and we drove everywhere and people would look at us and say now there goes a couple
he never pushed me
he told me he respected my virginity
and i liked that
they hear a loud creak
hes not moving
the other man he was a boy really he had no prospects
and he had no car
and he had no respect
he certainly had no respect for my virginity
and i liked that too
she takes a long luxurious drag
but i had to make a choice
i chose your grandfather
the day before the wedding i went to let the other boy down
met him by a river where we used to swim
well one thing led to another and when i returned home that night id left my virginity back in the tall grass by that river
sarah sits on the edge of her chair
but i did bring something back
a bite mark
that sonuvabitch left on my neck the size of a peach pit
did pappy see it
he did and he didnt
on the wedding night in this house i managed to squeak by
it was dark
we were shy
he took me in his arms and said im glad you waited for me
in other words i lost my virginity twice in the same week
they both laugh
no small feat
its an accomplishment
but the next morning your pappy saw it
he demanded an explanation
and sarah do you know how i got out of that pickle
i said what you dont remember giving me this
he said no
and i said well you were so fired up last night its a wonder you can remember anything
beat and the beast was tamed
sarah considers the story
and youve never been tempted to
come clean with your pappy
why should i tell him
he had nothing to do with it
i wonder what became of that boy
never saw him again
i dont regret a thing if thats what youre wondering
i was in fact
look what i have
i have you
beat and you know what else
i have the tall grass by that river
and those clouds
from where i was laying the clouds looked really beautiful that day
the same model we saw at the start of our story
we glide toward a miniature suburban development
row upon row of houses each no different than the next
over this i dont believe it
youre actually asking my opinion
you really want to know what i think
we tilt up to reveal that were in the well appointed office of the well heeled josh an architect in his early s
josh studies the model like a boy with a train set
sarah stands beside him
to tell you the truth no
i just wanted to hear your voice
youve barely said boo to me all morning
alright what do you think of it
youd have to pay me to live in that neighborhood
off his look hey what do i know
im just the assistant
what are they going to think
thats all that matters
to paraphrase you this is going to give them a major hard on
not the women of course
you havent met these women
sarah laughs catches herself and stops
sarah and josh move down a hall toward the elevators
josh is in micro management mode the champagne order
a messenger is meeting us at the site with the proofs
he reaches behind her and pats her butt
have you never heard of the phrase impulse control
they reach the elevators
i love it when youre full of contempt
she just glares
people are starting to notice josh
i work very hard to act completely indifferent toward you
the least you could do is to keep your hands to yourself
ive got a better idea
why dont i distribute a memo informing everyone that you and i are not sleeping together
josh just for the sake of variety could you take me seriously for a moment
i have another idea
lets just end it
i think we should
josh didnt expect this
the elevator arrives
he steps aboard and holds the door for her
im going to take the stairs
josh shrugs and lets the doors close
sarah considers the stairs then hits the down button again
sarah and todd eat lunch on a bench in a busy promenade
deli sandwiches in wax paper rest on their laps
i cant put my finger on it
i just dont feel its happening with us
you dont want it work out thats what youre saying
i mean i did
its no ones fault
you want your pickle
do you want your pickle
you know what the problem is
the first night we went out we shouldve just fucked
two dumb bunnies
without any history any baggage
a pair of blank slates
it couldve been perfectly meaningless
you want chemistry
the less you think the better the chemistry
less talk more action
its just not happening for me
the least you can do is give me your goddam pickle
they look away from each other
todd eats in silence
the pickle sits between them
joshs model come to life
a fallow stretch of land lined with unfinished houses some more skeletal than others
at one site we find two parked cars
a gold lincoln navigator and an old bmw convertible
a house in progress
the walls are in place but little else
stray two by fours saw horses electrical cable
in an upstairs room what will soon be the master bedroom josh confers with a construction supervisor
nearby sarah talks on her cell phone
into phone i dont care if it costs the same if its not dom perignon tell them we dont want it alright
anybody else call
as she hangs up the construction supervisor exits
sarah and josh are alone
guess ill be heading back
beat about the other day
are you having any second thoughts
youre angry i called it quits arent you
you can admit it
in fact i want to thank you
for sparing me from the most unhealthy relationship ive ever had in my life
for that i thank you
josh raises his hands in surrender
are you having seconds thoughts
i say lets make a clean break
lets just walk away from it
she extends her hand
what are you doing
lets seal the deal
its a little awkward but they do
now that weve put that behind us theres one problem left
where do we put the bed
josh gestures to the empty room
sarah smiles its a familiar game
oh the bed
lets put it against this wall
away from the morning sun
its got to go here
so you can see the hallway
they head out
as josh and sarah leave the house they decorate several rooms
not enough height for bunk beds
why do you assume there will be two children
there has to be
they need to keep each other company
definitely not enough space for two people to cook
i prefer to eat out
they size up the space enjoying their play
sara walks around imaginary furniture
i wouldnt put the ottoman there
where would you put it
it needs to go over
she waves her hand accidentally brushing against joshs chest
she lets her hand linger
they both know whats happening
we have another problem
and that would be
what do we do with the elephant in the room
youre very clever
she rubs his chest
we shouldnt be rude to an elephant
she lets her hand drop to his crotch
they can get very annoyed
if you ignore them
she pulls josh to her and kisses him
josh fairly attacks her his hands all over her body
after a few lustful beats he lifts her and she wraps her legs around him
its an absurd request the room is completely exposed but josh carries her to the front door and kicks it closed
as the door slams obscuring our view
with sarahs back against the door josh enters her
she looks up
with no roof above them she has a brilliant view of
they float past as she thinks sarah v
contd lets not put a roof on this house today
lets leave the walls unfinished
its okay not to know where the sofa goes
we can choose them another day
i like it the way it is
a work in progress
she moans theres nothing quiet about her at all
josh and sarah have finished
he tucks in his shirt
she puts on a shoe
i have to tell you that was the best break up sex ive ever had
sarah considers this
it was wasnt it
beat closure is important
josh now you can move on
you can meet someone who
someone whos not a prick like you
josh reacts slightly offended
beat as if that would have made any difference in this
what is this thing called again
shes fishing she hates herself for it
sarah contd it wouldnt have made any difference right
josh im surprised you have to ask
sarah im not asking
hell answer anyway
josh if my hands werent tied
it might have made all the difference
sarah i said i wasnt asking
and thats the worst answer you couldve given
cut to josh and sarah get into their respective cars her bmw his navigator
josh looks at himself in the rear view mirror
he reacts josh what the hell is this
sarah looks over
josh contd you bit me on the neck
ive got a goddam hickey
sure enough there is a bright red mark on his neck
sarah comes over
she reacts with shock embarrassment then
josh contd whats so goddam funny
you did this on purpose didnt you
sarah i did not
i was just
i didnt mean to
i was caught up in the moment
and she laughs again
josh what the hell are we going to do about this
sarah josh you are a big boy
you can take care of this on your own
josh glares at her starts his engine and leaves her in the dust
cut to todd is on the kitchen phone
lornas bracelet sits on the counter
into phone no no no
you dont understand
i dont want an appointment i just need to get in touch with her
she left a package here by mistake a gift
no id rather give it to her myself
lorna but i assume none of you use your real names
but she was working last week
and you dont have a forwarding number
look its really important that i get this back to her so the line goes dead
he dials again
then a knock at the door
todd reacts hes not expecting anyone
he opens the door and finds still dressed in the clothes she wore earlier
she holds a small paper bag
i brought you something
she hands him the bag
he looks inside
beat whats in your hair
she touches her hair
lots of sawdust at the job site
beat can i come in
todd puts the bag of pickles on the kitchen counter
he sees lornas bracelet
and slides it into a trash can
josh still sporting his hickey approaches the humorless teenage girl behind the counter
need some help
yes i have a problem
i need some
something to cover up a
hell just take a look
josh shows the girl his hickey
i can do without the attitude thank you
impatient but what do i do with it
just put it on
and call your lawyer
in the driveway of his fashionable home are two parked cars
joshs mercedes s and his wifes lexus rx
in the mercedes josh finishes applying the concealer to his neck
he checks himself in the mirror the hickey is completely gone
his hands however have concealer all over them
josh washes his hands in the master bathroom
he double checks his neck in the mirror
from the adjoining bedroom we hear but do not see his wife gwen
im reading a stupid article in a stupid magazine
if its stupid why read it
ignores this the whole issue is devoted to famous couples who are breaking up
listen to this
remember the blonde doctor on that show you hate
shes a bore
shes breaking up with her husband of twenty years
said a friend her shows in syndication shes thin shes rich and she wants to play
josh dries his hands
some poor tree gave its life so we could know that
its comforting reading about these broken marriages
josh opens the door into the gwen sits under the covers with her magazine
in her late s she is a refined patrician beauty
as josh undresses for bed why
its not enough for our marriage to succeed
everyone elses must fail
is this going to be one of those nights
one of those nights we talk
theres no need to talk because theres no problem
he gets into bed next to her
ive been under a lot of stress
you dont have to apologize
theres nothing wrong with the slump were going through
in fact its a good thing
he turns off the side light
we cant see them the room is completely dark
too much passion can ruin a marriage
look at eric and sylvia
at the beginning you couldnt pry them apart
they were joined at the genitals
total burn out
a marriage cannot sustain that kind of intensity
its good for people to grow bored with each other
that way they can meet and fall in love again
she snuggles up to him strokes his back
in case you hadnt noticed
im trying to seduce you
i can feel that
youre welcome to reciprocate
josh turns on the light and sits up
to be seduced there needs to be an element of surprise
i know all your moves
you know mine
how can there be any surprise
gwen sits up throws back the sheet
rub my feet
i think we should have an affair
with each other
that makes no sense
you pick me up at a bar
pretend i dont know you
ignores him or we could meet at a hotel
ill register under my maiden name
just like the graduate
the graduate is about a married woman having an affair with a college boy
when i met you you were a college boy
gwen the graduate is a story about a very unhappy woman who has an affair out of wedlock
as i recall it turns out rather badly for her
rethe foot rub you can stop
thats what they do
im not an actor
and i love you the way you are
i love you too
and he turns out the light again
pretending to be strangers is not going to solve the problem
who said there was a problem
a cocktail party at joshs firm
josh is the center of attention greeting investors fielding compliments
gwen stands beside him drinking champagne dom perignon after all
through the crowd he spots sarah entering with her date todd
your lovely assistant is here
retodd you didnt tell me she had a new boyfriend
i dont ask her about her personal life
sarah and todd arrive
hey you two
todd this is my boss josh and his wife gwen
todd and josh shake hands
sarahs told me a lot about you
josh is not sure how to take that
sarah you look great
youve been keeping my boy on his best behavior
its a dirty job but somebodys got to do it
i know he asks to go above and beyond the call of duty
he can be tough
josh im trying to thank sarah for all the extra attention she gives you
we should really have you over for dinner sarah
its been too long
you can bring
im hopeless when it comes to names
especially after two glasses of champagne
hey im still working on the first thank you
to todd so are you two living together
sarah and todd both laugh
weve only known each other a few weeks
josh reacts he knew nothing of this
you two seem to fit
it only took me a few days to know with josh
in fact i knew after the first date
you knew what
that he was the one for me
to sarah she loves to embarrass me
to gwen dont stop
i want to hear about this first date
well it was the cheapest date ive ever been on
i was broke
do you know the chinese place on third
that little hole in the wall
i know it
used to be a cool dive
now its ultra hip and overpriced
this news gives gwen pause
i think our first dinner cost a grand total of ten dollars
gwen loves to dissect our first date
it was a momentous night
babe we should really go back there
josh gestures to the bar
gwen why dont you continue your stroll down memory lane while i drink
todd you up for it
they move away toward as josh and todd sidle up
to bartender gin
todd what are you having
im fine thanks
sarahs an attractive girl
you two serious
shrugs hard to say
she wants to play the field right
no thats not it
you want to fuck around
cmon were guys
i know the drill
todd considers his audience then decides to open up we dated a few times and to be honest i was on the fence about sarah
i liked her but i didnt think we were in a good groove
then a couple weeks ago her grandmother died
i didnt know
beat she didnt say a thing about it
it wasnt unexpected but sarah took it really hard
so where did that leave me
i was ambivalent about things right
but then my ambivalence had to take a back seat
i had to be there for her
and ready or not our relationship became
a real relationship
josh simply listens
you know i wasnt ready to be that involved with anybody
i dont know
death has a funny way of making you get outside yourself
josh looks past todd gwen is still chatting with sarah
gwen makes eye contact with josh and sends him a warm smile
josh and gwen drive home in silence
gwen notices something out the window
you missed the on ramp
somewhere we need to go first
the mercedes pulls up to the happiness chinese restaurant
josh and gwen get out and take in the sight we dont have to do this tonight
yes we do
she peers in the window
we cant go in here
he opens the door for her
were different too
modern non chinese decor
anything but a hole in the wall
josh and gwen are in a booth sarahs a very interesting girl
did you know shes training for the marathon
i dont want to talk about sarah
what do you want to talk about then
i want to talk about me
and what a fool ive been
gwen is not prepared for this
i thought if we came here tonight we could
flustered but i thought you were over this place
theres nothing left
not one remnant of our first date
josh sees a plate of fortune cookies on the next table somebody left without eating them
brightens the fortune cookies havent changed
he brings over the plate
youre supposed to wait i cant wait
i have to know
he opens the first
reading you are on the verge of success
gwen laughs opens one herself
reading you will have a change of plans
josh reacts opens a third
reading you are very creative
thats what ive heard
the last cookie
you open it
he slowly cracks in open
checks both sides i got a blank
no its perfect
no problems no history nothing
he takes her hand
josh and gwen approach their car
behind them the restaurant is closing
by the way i didnt get your name
off his smile oh my name
she glances across the street
a shop window sign reads bail bonds
my name is gail
well gail im not usually this forward on a first date may i take you to my car and ravish you
on one condition
that you tell me your name
oh i thought everyone knew my name
im bill gates
they get into the back seat and begin to kiss
is it true what they say bill about billionaires
that all the wealth is just a way to compensate
people are jealous
i can imagine
it must be so lonely at the top
he reaches between her knees
what are you doing
what do you think im doing
beat the fortune cookie said youre on the verge of success
were not in a bed
you shouldnt read fortune cookies too literally
josh swings gwen onto his lap
they go at each other like
a couple of college kids
as he makes love to his wife he thinks can anyone see us
is anyone looking
why should it bother you
with your wife
thats the way its supposed to be
you know every inch of her
the shape of her ass
the mole under her nipple
the whole history of her body
and you know that if you really concentrate you can succeed
shes someone you dont know
he puts his mind to it gwen and her mother joanne are in the living room looking at samples of fabric
at sixty joanne is robust and shrewd
thats the problem with this room it needs color
the vibrant colors of haiti
personally haiti does nothing for me
when your father and i were there this was before you were born i almost died from a piece of lettuce and i wouldnt want anything to remind me of
beat anyway quit changing the subject
gwen puts down the swatches
i didnt say anything
because youre not sure
no im sure
im sure hes sleeping with her
beat and i may have to kill him
you think i should just forget about it
yes i do
mother dont you think honesty is essential in a marriage
it can be quite detrimental
gwen begins to pace in exasperation
you know where it will get you
your whole marriage will unravel and youll have nothing
all the things you take for granted month long vacations in st
lucia theyll disappear
youll be a divorced woman in her late s
why did i invite you over
you make me feel like shit
thats my job
the phone rings
the machine can get it
i dont monitor calls
it makes me feel like im hiding in my own home
from the answering machine gwen this is david warren
hopefully a welcome voice from your past
my shows on hiatus and im in town for the weekend
id love to catch up
are you free for coffee
pick up the phone
gwen just stares at the machine
i have no idea what youre up to
i hope life is treating you well
i heard through a friend of a friend of a friend that youre still married
if you want give me a call
im crashing at my sisters
the number is hold on the number is
hope to hear from you
how long has it been
have you ever seen his show
its absolutely dreadful
i never miss it
if josh isnt home ill watch it
its kismet then
a brief liaison with an old flame
the perfect way to deal with your anger
youre an insane mother
itll be good for your self esteem
did it occur to you that maybe he just wants to have coffee
joanne crosses to the answering machine
rewinds the tape
on hiatus and im in town for the weekend
are you free for coffee
she hits stop
hes flirting admit it
hes calling out of the blue
joanne gathers her purse
im right and im going
but take a tip from someone whos been there
opportunity is knocking gwen
you have a chance to level the playing field
beat you have a chance to do something good for your marriage
gwen fresh from the shower studies her face in the mirror as josh unseen in the bedroom dresses for work
we could use some more color in the living room
i said youre right
about more color in the living room
im glad you think so
she leans closer to inspect a new wrinkle
an upscale hotel
gwen in a sheer blouse and a slim leather skirt fills out the registration card at the front desk
the desk clerk looks up from his computer
and how many nights will you be staying with us
we do have a two night minimum
she hands him the card
id like to pay in cash
that wont be a problem
we just need a credit card imprint for your incidentals
the desk clerk puts her at ease
which we tear up when you check out
will you be needing more than one key
gwen and david lunch in the hotels elegant dining room
david is quite the draw turning heads across the room
and its no wonder
he has real magnetism
im still reeling
it was the most humbling experience of my life
getting raked over the coals by a bunch of sixteen year old drama students
at my own alma mater
im surprised they werent all over you
they were with knives drawn
what did they say
basically why am i working on a piece of shit like malibu nights when i should be doing shakespeare or chekhov
beat it was brutal
a waiter delivers a bottle of champagne to david
compliments from the table in the corner
the waiter gestures
david and gwen turn
in the corner three middle aged women are smiling
david mouths a gracious thank you their way
those women are happy youre not doing shakespeare
you look great
you havent changed a bit
i dont think im malibu nights material
walking boob jobs
you look like you enjoy kissing them
its very simple
i close my eyes and imagine im kissing someone else
someone else in particular
if shes as tan as you i dont want to hear about it
david reaches for his wallet
here take a look
he hands her a photo
in it we see david standing with a distinguished man in his mid s
with them is a smiling boy about eleven
gwen is nonplussed
whats wrong with this picture huh
lets start with the man upper left
and the best thing thats ever happened to me
and the boy
hes andys son from a marriage that needless to say didnt work
andy came out when eric was just five
and when did you
about fifteen years ago
off gwens look is this too much information
but fifteen years ago
that was right after you and me
was i the last woman
was i that bad
no you were fantastic
i was completely confused
gwen quickly gulps down some champagne
whats the matter
im very happy for you
and i have to confess im relieved
oh what the hell were friends right
i had this ridiculous idea that you wanted to get together to have a
for old times sake
and frankly i wasnt looking forward to turning you down
which i would have of course
which youre not because youre
she slides her empty glass toward him
would you pour me a little more david
gwen leans against the front desk
the desk clerk approaches
can i help you maam
gwen looks lost
are you okay
id like to check out
was there a problem
i was stood up
by the past
we wont charge you for the room
no you dont understand
beat more than you might think
gwen stares at him
shall i close out the account
i need the room after all
beat will you show me the way there
the desk clerk looks at her with no apparent interest
youre in luck
i was just about to take my break
the desk clerk and gwen ride in the elevator
there is no discernible connection between them
the desk clerk leads gwen to the room
it couldnt look more business like
he locks the door
she surveys the room
something from the mini bar
hows the air conditioning
shall i pull down the covers
do you want to know my name
he takes her in his arms
ill be fine
beat this could get you in trouble
you could lose your job right
i dont care
you dont even know me
we have nothing in common
thats where youre wrong
he begins to unbutton her blouse
after a beat she begins to unbutton his shirt
a little later
a maid vacuums the carpet as the desk clerk emerges followed by gwen
they cross to the elevator as business like as before
to the maid buenas tardes senora
gwen and the desk clerk board the elevator
he presses l for lobby
she presses p for parking
thank you for taking care of the room
and they ride in silence
in gwens mind and now the score is tied
oh my god what will i tell my mother
i did it with a desk clerk
hardly the affair to remember
of course she will disapprove
is english even his first language
this is your idea of a liaison
your idea of leveling the playing field
you dont even know the boys name gwen touches the desk clerks arm
whats your name
youre kidding me
gwen laughs she cant help it
whats so funny
nothing its just she laughs even harder
the elevator door opens
david gets out and looks at her oddly
sorry i just
i didnt think youd be named david
the door closes on gwen leaving david in the lobby
a bit befuddled
david resumes his post
desk clerk works beside him
he leans to david theres a woman waiting to see you
shes been here for half an hour
he points to a lobby chair where we find rosalie spunky mercurial
she and david made eye contact
she springs up and advances toward him
why are you here
you werent going to return my calls
dont you have more important things to do
picking flowers honeymoon reservations
is there somewhere we can talk
the desk phone rings
david picks it up
into phone front desk david speaking
tap water is very drinkable in this city
of course sir
well send up some bottled water right away
he hangs up
is there somewhere we can talk
whats wrong with here
but here i wont be tempted to raise my voice or do something rash
thats the first lesson of hotel management
never lose your cool no matter how annoying the guest is
not that i plan to go into hotel management
i dont have ambitions in that direction
or any direction if i recall you correctly
the desk phone rings again
exasperated david grabs it
into phone front desk david speaking
yes maam the restaurant has a smoking section
well i didnt make the policy
if its any consolation the smokers are seated in a little corner of the patio and they feel very bad about themselves
he hangs up
and gives rosalie a very deliberate look
rosie youd better leave
before i get myself fired
she starts to protest
thinks better of it and exits
david hangs his uniform shirt in his locker
he gathers his personal things
a jacket a knapsack and
a violin case
the hotel manager approaches
yo fiddler on the roof
david reacts this is the last person he wants to deal with
regards the violin wish i could play an instrument
chicks really dig that stuff
tried the guitar in high school
what can i say
always a struggle
i hear you
for instance it takes a certain discipline to know that when youre working at the hotel when youre on the clock
shrugs you shouldnt fuck the guests
david was not expecting this
hotel manager contd you want to bring your girlfriend here on your day off
thats a different story
ill even give you the corporate rate on a room
beat just dont do it while youre on the clock
you hear me
it wont happen again
david marches away
in a sun lit practice room a string quartet rehearses
four men david included perform an energetic movement from a beethoven quartet
note throughout the film weve heard this string quartet as underscore
we meet the soundtrack
david plays with emotion and a physicality we havent seen in him truly this is where he lives
after the rehearsal
violin at his side david trudges through the exit
music emanates from every room
he turns a corner runs smack into shes been waiting
she simply picks up where they left off i want you to be there on sunday
you told me wed always be friends
youre an important part of my life david
theres so much history between us
i dont want to trash it simply because because what
because youre getting married
rosie i want you to be happy
and someday well be friends
someday well all go out to dinner
the four of us
the four of us
me you jerry and whatever pale imitation of you i can dig up to be my date
but hes on a roll and the check will come and jerry will pick up the tab and ill protest but not too much
then youll give me a kiss on the cheek and some dim memory will stir in me but not for too long
and well say it was great to see you
and it will be great to see you
but until then
david exits leaving rosalie alone in the cacophonous hall
a clean modern apartment that rosalie shares with jerry late s upstanding sturdy good looks
rosalie and jerry sit in the living room meeting with their wedding planner a highly efficient woman in her mid s
weve got a few more things to cover
theres a courtyard behind the church
its a popular backdrop
our photographer says the light is gorgeous
we need twenty minutes before the ceremony for singles
jerry your fathers press secretary insists on sending someone from the papers
i told him you want to keep this as private as possible but
what could i do
it is an election year
exactly what he said
the guest list
we have a few more no shows
she consults a list
bennett send their regrets
rothman will no be attending
hes not coming
after all that shit you put me through now hes not even coming
the wedding planner smiles politely
so if there are any last minute ignores her i guess that means youve been talking with him
yes i talked to him
to wedding planner would you excuse us for a minute
take your time
rosalie gets up and leads jerry into once they are out of earshot i talked to david
i uninvited him
i told him it wasnt right
i told him he shouldnt be at our wedding
when did you decide this
i dont know
i just realized i dont want our wedding to be about where ive been
i want it to be about where you and i are going
what did he say
i want to know
he was disappointed of course he was
hes still in love with you
but he understands
i drew the line honey
i did it for us
rosalie gives him a kiss
amidst a clutter of unpaid bills take out cartons and laundry david practices the violin
he plays a bach partita not for the easily intimidated
the phone rings
he lets it ring a while before picking up
into phone what do you want rose
were you sleeping
i can hear you
he moves to the window
rosalie on her cell waves to him from the sidewalk three stories below
its so sad
why do you always play sad songs
i dont write em rose
beat is our conversation over now
please let me in
she laughs mischievously
you dont trust me
beat stay there
ill be right
wait a minute
this is insane
im not coming down
go home rose
i mean it
im going to wait here for one minute
you do that
then im gone
you wont see me again
she hangs up
he hangs up
rosalie sits on the front steps
to himself be my guest
sit there all night
david turns from the window
he accidentally knocks his metronome to the floor setting it off
david shuts it off goes to the door
his hand on the knob if i go down those stairs
it will only lead to one place
right back here
the two of us
a short brilliant moment
one more to add to the gallery
then empty handed again with nothing to show for it but an emotional hangover
im not going to open this door
like the man said dont fuck the guests
rosalie is on the front steps
she smiles as she hears the door open its david
he joins her
ive got nothing to say to you
the reason i wont just leave you alone is not because im confused
my feelings are perfectly clear
i know you find it incomprehensible that i can love jerry and love you
and that one love has nothing to do with the other
but its true
this is bullshit
i cant spell it out any more plainly
because i cant be this close to you
and not want to touch you
and he does touch her
he puts his hand on her leg
and if i cant do that i dont want to be your friend
dont be so mean
david flashes an angry look
then he pulls rosalie close to him
the bottom line is
if im with you i have to touch you to kiss you
that doesnt work for friends does it
she doesnt answer she lets him stroke her leg
when im not with you this is more than you need to know
if i touch myself i can only think about one person
no one else
what do we do
what do you mean we
this is your problem
beat my only problem is how to get you out of my mind
how to erase you
delete every bit of you
presses an imaginary key into the ether
she kisses him
he engulfs her in his arms
you have to say good bye
i dont know how
david and rosalie have sex on the single bed in his spartan room
shes on top of him they face each other
the lovemaking is both fierce and tender longing and leaving rolled into one
as rosalie grows more aroused she begins to cry
tears quietly stream down her cheeks
david reacts should we stop
rosalie is too choked up to answer she shakes her head no
and they continue tears and sex
david sits in bed alone while rosalie showers in the adjoining bathroom
david will you hand me my shampoo
its in my purse
david opens rosalies purse and finds a travel size bottle of shampoo
he just shakes his head
rosalie drives home
checks herself in the mirror her hair is still damp
she rolls down the window to blow dry it
she turns on the radio finds a rock and roll station
noisy mindless perfect
in her mind hail mary full of grace blessed be the fruit of thy womb jesus
holy mary mother of god pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death amen
hail mary full of grace blessed be the fruit of
rosalie slips inside the door
no sign of jerry
she removes her shoes and tiptoes into the television is on the sound is muted
an infomercial is playing
jerry is sleeping
she nudges him
he doesnt stir
rosalie sits at the foot of the bed
she grabs the remote and un mutes the sound
a physical fitness expert is talking
and the change is not just physical
youll be amazed how quickly your whole outlook will she flicks off the tv
rosalie undresses and climbs into bed
she starts to kiss jerry
slowly he wakes
what time is it
he looks at the time
it is late
we couldve gone on all night
she rubs his chest
we need to make love now
i cant explain it
we just need to make love now
he kisses her neck her breasts
suddenly she stops him taking his face in her hands
whats the matter
i just need to fix this moment in my mind
a long beat
she studies his face
i love you
i dont want to spend another minute of my life without you
off his reaction you dont have to say anything
she climbs on top of him
youre forgetting something
no im not
he laughs uncomfortably
dont you think
no i dont
lets not use it tonight
beat im ready
if youre ready so am i
she straddles him rocking back and forth
with grim determination
talk to me
jerry and rosalie dressed informally pose for a publicity photo
the photographer is todd
each click of his camera brings a blinding flash
todd very good
you both look great
perfect shot for the paper
rosalie to jerry sotto voce i didnt mean to put pressure on you
jerry babe youre making too much out of this
beat its not like i didnt enjoy making love
rosalie i know
beat but i also know you wouldve enjoyed it more if i hadnt
jerry raised the stakes
rosalie i wasnt going to put it that way
beat but its true
jerry maybe it is
but please dont read too much into it
rosalie i wont
cut to high ceiling
stained glass windows
dark mahogany pews
at the altar jerry and rosalie confer with their priest late s doctrinaire
a lot of young couples prefer husband and wife to the traditional man and wife
personally i dont feel the phrase man and wife gives the woman a diminutive status
but i leave the choice in your hands
do you have a husband and wife
jerry simply nods
to jerry after the blessing ill instruct you to kiss the bride
keep it simple
that could be tough
the priest feigns amusement
remember this is gods house
and there will be prominent people here as well
not to mention the press
so lets keep things on the up and up
jerry accompanies his father late s on a cigar buying expedition
tobacco enthusiasts relax in leather chairs
wafts of smoke hang in the air expensive smoke
jerrys father finds a brand he likes
here we are
two hundred a box
you dont have to do this dad
if i cant come to the bachelor party i want to be there in spirit
beat the boys will like these
i remember my bachelor night
frankly i wish i didnt
not a night im particularly proud of
ill leave it at that
why are you sharing this
or warning me
i know you
you wont make an ass out of yourself
a little something from your mother and me
he reaches into his pocket hands jerry a key
its a key
smiles theres a new housing development just west of here
ive been giving the developer a lot of breaks and
now hes giving me one in return
im almost embarrassed to say how little this cost me
i cant accept this
yes you can
make your old man happy
jerry says nothing
i get it
this is rosalies domain
she should have a say in where you two settle down
but dont worry you wont be forcing her hand
because shes going to love it
jerry just nods
lets ring these babies up
bachelor party in progress
in the living room a dozen guys smoke cuban rolled cigars drink shots of tequila and watch a stripper perform
the least boisterous of the group is jerry who watches the action with a drunken glow
the partys host jerrys best friend enters and summons jerry into the best friend aims jerry toward the stairs
alright my man
do i have a choice
then im ready
the guys pitched in for this
he pats jerry on the back
so go up there and get our moneys worth
jerry starts up jerry approaches the bedroom door with a fateful air
he touches the door knob
in his mind why am i stopping
theres a hot girl waiting on the other side of the door
everyone cuts you slack for this kind of thing
this is supposed to happen
its a tradition a time honored ritual
losing your tooth losing your virginity losing the championship
if i walk through this door what am i losing
my father was here and his father was here and his fathers father was here hand on the door
what am i waiting for
he pushes it open
the room is dark except for a shaft of moonlight that silhouettes a girl on the bed
her foot dangles off the side the toenails painted blood red
jerry turns on a lamp to meet sitting on the bed in a tank top and a short skirt
as fetching as ever
you must be the groom
the guys were right
youre a looker
did they also tell you i dont usually do this kind of thing
she pulls off the tank top revealing a black brassiere
all the better
i like challenges
she crosses to face him
getting married tomorrow huh
yes i am
love honor and obey
thats the drill isnt it
tomorrow i take the vows
without much ceremony she starts massaging his crotch
so technically this doesnt count
you cant break a vow you havent taken can you
you sound like my lawyer
lorna kneels down before him
she unzips his pants
ive done my share of lawyers
they spend most of the hour negotiating the tip
beat thats a joke
i got it
she pulls down his pants looks up at him
something bothering you
i dont know if i should be doing this
she starts to stroke him
want my philosophy
if we dont make mistakes now and then how are we ever going to learn from them
now you sound like my priest
ive done a few of them too
they spend most of the hour feeling bad about what theyre doing
but they do it anyway
then they shortchange you on the tip
one of them absolved me once before he left
thats something i guess
who are the best tippers
the guys who can least afford it
guys with families
and the worst
i dont discriminate
besides a penis doesnt know from politics
a penis is the most politically incorrect part of the body
it has a simple agenda
rehis erection he knows what he wants
and she proceeds to give him a blow job
jerry guides her with his hands
he tries to relax
but he cant
he yanks her away from him
i cant do it
dont worry about it
lorna instinctively puts a little distance between herself and jerry
hey its no sweat
i get paid either way
no you dont understand
i cant fucking go through with it
off lornas non reaction i cant get married
all at once his face fills with rage
jerry swings his fist into the wall punching a hole in it
adrenaline pumping he doesnt even notice the blood on his hand
she shakes her head shes completely nonplussed
that was smart
now youre bleeding
she takes him by the arm into she runs cold water over his hand its really banged up
then she wraps a towel around it
do you love her
i dont know
lets sit down
they return to lorna and jerry sit on the floor their backs resting against the bed
now the mood is intimate
she wants to have a baby
thats the way its supposed to be right
i wouldnt know
my parents approve of her
her parents approve of me
whats wrong with a little approval
jerry gives her a hard look
thats my whole life
my whole goddam carrot and stick life
ever since i can remember ive been chasing after this person or that persons approval
playing one role then another
the good student
the good son
the industrious boy
pats on the back
handshakes from people who matter
the good boyfriend getting on his knees and proposing to the good girlfriend
the dutiful bachelor receiving the traditional blow job from a
jerry stops himself
lets him off the hook professional
ive lost count of all the roles theres so many of them
beat i have no idea who im playing now
i dont see what the big deal is
i play roles all the time
and you want to do that your entire life
beat i dont even know your name
and ill do whatever the hell i want
well i cant live somebody elses version of my life anymore
do you understand
she gets up and crosses to the window
lifts it up
heres your chance
its not too far a drop to the lawn
you have gas in your car
its the first day of the rest of your life
i promise you this opportunity will not come around twice
he looks out the window the suburbs at night
cozy warm lit
im going to do it
he smiles at lorna
then he climbs out the window
she watches him hit the ground hobble across the lawn and get into his car
and hes gone
she sits on the bed takes in the room
it seems ordinary and strange all at once
lorna spots the bloody towel jerry left it on the floor
she folds it neatly concealing the blood
the wee hours
the only person at the counter is lorna
she pours cream in her coffee watches it swirl
something else catches her eye
behind the counter lies a crumpled newspaper
to waitress mind if i have that
morning paper should be here any minute
i just want the crossword puzzle
the waitress puts the paper in front of her
it falls open to the metro section where lorna sees a photo of jerry and rosalie the one todd shot
the accompanying headline deputy mayors son to wed tomorrow
the waitress cranes her neck to see
theres a catch alright
terri still under the covers studies the torn clipping from the paper
lorna brushes her teeth
its the oldest condition known to man
im telling you hes two states away by now
beat he made a clean break
i know it
terri shakes her head
if youre wrong youre paying for drinks tonight
lorna and terri walk briskly down the sidewalk
they round a corner to see a magnificent catholic church
a white limousine decorated with streamers sits in front surrounded by expensive cars
well what do you know
lorna cant believe it she almost feels betrayed
told you we shouldve dressed up
were going inside
but lorna is bounding toward the cathedral
lorna and terri enter
the vestibule looks empty
suddenly they are startled by a flash
they turn to find a photographer checking a bulb its todd
lorna we shouldnt be here
hearing her name todd looks up
then he gathers his gear and starts inside
but lorna intercepts him
excuse me could you tell me whos getting married in
beat hey i know you
the wedding guy
have we met
you dont remember me
you must be thinking of somebody else
i must be thinking of someone else
and he disappears into the church
what was that all about
nothing my ass
you broke the cardinal rule of the trade
pedantic never acknowledge a client in public
what is this
hooking for dummies
lorna grabs terri by the wrist and slips into they take a seat in the last pew
the front pews are packed all eyes focussed on the wedding party at the altar
jerry and rosalie face the priest who blesses the ring
the wedding ring is a powerful symbol
it is a circle with no beginning and no end
it is also the circle that encloses your love for each other ill bet that dress is vera wang
jerry and rosalie turn to face each other
do you rosalie take this man to have and to hold in sickness and in health till death do you part
and do you jerry take this woman to have and to hold in sickness and in health till death do you part
lorna studies jerrys face for any sign any hint of his real feelings
then by the power invested in me by christ our lord i now pronounce you husband and wife
to jerry you may kiss the bride
lorna leans forward
shes moved despite herself
terri looks over
youre crying i cant believe it
no im not
beat weddings make me cry
the congregation applauds
jerry shakes hands with the best man his father
he gives his son an approving pat on the back
suddenly a security guard appears in lornas face
ladies this event is strictly for invited guests
were with the grooms party
lets not do this
youre not with the groom
terri points to lorna
she had his cock in her mouth last night
doesnt that count
lorna bursts out laughing
laughing through her tears
the guard is not amused
lorna and terri race down the church steps giggling like school girls
they turn a corner lean against a wall
catching her breath terri lights a cigarette
i dont know why he came back
beat it wasnt love
guess youll never know for sure
they start down the sidewalk remember the guy i told you about the writer
he said he wanted to immortalize you
what a line
hes been steady work
every tuesday for the past month
well get this
yesterday he called and asked me out
on a date
a non paying date
no money will be exchanged
you want to hear the weird part
i said yes
that is weird
you gotta keep an open mind lorna
beat you never know with people
they wait at the crosswalk
lorna idly glances at the window of a brownstone apartment
a man finishing a cigarette
he catches lorna looking his way
a woman comes up behind the man and casually embraces him
the man gives lorna a last look before pulling the curtains closed
the light has changed
terri starts walking
cmon what are you waiting for
she lingers at the curb for a moment pondering her next move
