by vince mckewin february its raining lightly in the harbor and the water around the moored boats looks dirty and cold
we pick up a sad excuse for a boat sitting in an end slip
its a sea gull shitcovered thirtyfoot cabin cruiser that hasnt cruised in a long long time
a ratty looking unpainted plywood addition has been nailed to the top of the cabin
its partially covered with a blue plastic tarp
the tarp moves and shane falcos half naked torso emerges from under it
shane is late twenties golden boy handsome but quickly going to seed
he looks hung over
shane glances up at the sky and rain
he pulls on the top part of an old patched wet suit and zips it up
were buzzing around the harbor with shane in an old zodiac inflatable dinghy
shane has pulled up the attached rubber hood to his wet suit so that only the white pasty oblong of his face is visible
its still raining as he steers the little boat around the sailboats and yachts
he pulls up to a fiftyfoot sailboat and cuts the engine
with practiced moves he ties the dinghy to the rear rail of the sailboat and clips a bill for services rendered on the sailboats stern line
he slips on a weight belt puts on a pair of old gaffer taped goggles jams the end of a air hose in his mouth and falls backward out of
the dinghy and into the water
its dark dirty and murky
suddenly shane floats into frame and comes at us with a long spatula
he attacks the underside of the sailboat which is covered with green algae muck that hangs a foot off the bottom of the boat
the spatula scrapes away the green mess revealing the pure white underside of the boat
as he scrapes
muck from the boat floats past him
this doesnt look like fun
as he works he happens to look down and notices something on the bottom
amidst the beer cans and other trash something golden is sitting on the bottom
shane takes a deep pull on his hose lets it go and drifts down
a shaft of sunlight penetrates the murky water and reveals a broken trophy half buried in the mud
shane kneels over it and picks it up
the trophy is almost a full size football rendered in bronze attached to a broken base
shane turns the ball over in his hands
he grips the seams like hes done this before
then he holds the football out in front of him
suddenly he starts barking garbled signals to an imaginary offense
he turns to his running back as he yells something like blue
it comes out in bubbles he cocks his left leg and his wide receiver goes in motion
then on the snap he turns and starts a five step drop
he moves in slow motion because hey
he executes a perfect play action fake on the third step of his drop and looks down field for his receivers
but theres a blitz
he steps up in the pocket but a linebackers arm almost takes his head off
he dodges he bobs he weaves in a kind of delicate ballet
he rolls left and keeps looking for the open man
suddenly he points down field pulls up and cocks his arm
the ball comes behind his ear and snaps forward in a perfect release
the trophy spins out of frame but we hold on shane as he watches his pass
suddenly he throws both arms up in a touchdown signal
we stay on him as he freezes in this pose of victory fifteen feet underwater on the trash covered muddy bottom of marina del rey
a miami dolphin linebacker crushes a washington redskin running back and lands on his throat elbow first
its a beautiful fall day in november and miami is beating the skins in front of seventy six thousand crazed washington fans
the redskins are at their home stadium better known as the big o
john madden and pat summerall are calling the game in shirtsleeves
that play my friends sums up the redskins running game all day long
now washington calls their last time out
madden leans over to do his diagram that shows up on your tv screen
we stay on him as he draws and explains
hey the dolphins do this as good as anybody
see in a four three two two you got the guards
plugging up the middle then the corners
boom and boom
are free to box
leaving the middle linebacker to cut off the trap here
third and twenty two but forget the first down with eight seconds showing and the skins down by a touchdown
could be the last play
could be the last play of the season if the players go out
redskin quarterback eddie martel is conferring with redskin head coach bud tildon near the bench
madden and summerall continue over
take it all in people
this could be it for
we move to veteran redskin center reese evans standing on the sidelines uniform totally clean
he looks near tears
once again if you havent heard it was announced during halftime that the n
players association will hold a press conference immediately following this game that would make it about five oclock eastern time and it is expected that the players union will announce
a strike effective immediately
twelve striking looking women dressed in burgundy and gold are doing some inane chatter to a section of fans that ignore them
the girls are led by pretty annabelle farrell a bundle of manic energy inside a body from heaven
its all about money folks
more money of course and aint it always
the shame of it is the big losers are you out there the fans
the redskin quarterback moves to the huddle
here we go third down eight seconds to play ball on the dolphins thirty three yard line
skins down by a touchdown
the huddle breaks and martel sets up over the center
the ball is snapped and martel drops back
he looks for a receiver and doesnt see anybody
he steps up in the pocket sees an opening and takes off running down field
there goes martel
martel is a pretty good broken field runner for a big guy
plus with the defense covering every possible receiver hes got a lot of daylight
nobody has touched him as he crosses the fifteen
suddenly a safety smaller than martel looms in front of him at the ten
martel goes down in one of those wimpy quarterback slides before the safety can even hit him
the gun sounds and the game is over
they look at each other in disbelief well
martel goes down ten yards short of a score
on maybe the last play of the season
i think he might have slipped
yeah theres a lot of that going around
well see these guys throughout
theyre typical low level washington bureaucrats named todd rod and bob who live for the hogs the traditional name for the redskin offensive linemen
todd is shirtless and his entire upper body is painted redskin red
at that moment they are livid with their quarterback and bob is speaking for them all
were coming to your house tonight and were gonna fucking kill you
and if you got a dog were gonna kill your fucking dog too
behind her the rest of the cheerleaders are already walking away
annabelle looks at quarterback martel with pure disgust as he walks off the field
the rooms blinds are pulled tightly against the bright sunlight
only the blue light of a tv illuminates anything
suddenly we hear an old man in the bed give out with a loud piercing wail
the door to the room bangs open and an english male nurse named augustine ripley dressed in white comes running in
hes carrying a syringe in each hand poised at the ready
he runs to the bed of the still wailing edward francis oneil
oneil is hooked up to an oxygen tank watching the just completed redskin game with the sound off
did they win or lose
oneil continues to wail
that has the distinct tonal quality of a loss
he puts one needle down and jabs oneil with the other one
he murmurs to the old man as he injects him
nice medicine for a loss
keeps us calm
makes us not so sad
keeps us on an even keel
gives us some perspective doesnt it
and well save the winning medicine for next sunday wont we
if you keep talking to me like im a five year old im going to hurt you
he reaches for the phone and hits the speed dial
well want to talk to coach now wont we
he hands the phone to oneil
on the phone what the fuck was that
coach tildon sitting in his office
we can hear players getting dressed listening to music and getting showers outside his open door
on the phone i think he slipped
bullshit he slipped
he could have scored
anybody could have scored
i got one foot in the god damn grave and i could have scored
mister oneil lets face facts the players are going out
its gonna happen
and nobody wants to get hurt on the last play before a strike that could go on for the rest of the season
you god damn wimp
oneil throws the phone down
augustine picks it up and then cranks up the oxygen a notch
oneil takes big gulps of the rich air
it always makes you feel better when you fire someone we know it does dont we
get me jimmy mcginty
get him here
oneil sucks hard on the oxygen
a reporter is interviewing wilson jones the huge defensive end for the redskins
wilson wears an enormous diamond earring
wilson is dressing at his locker
hey man i do what my union says
but youre already one of the highest paid players in the game
the fans just dont see the point of a player like you striking
let me tell you something im a big man you see
wilson holds his arms out
yes hes gigantic
there are some days when i am so beat up that i cannot dress my own big ass
i asked management for a valet or some shit to help me dress and they said no way
so fuck em
shut up everybody here it is
somebody turns up a tv in the locker room
a handsome ex player named jerome lindell steps up to a podium at a press conference
hes wearing a two thousand dollar suit
on the tv he is identified with a super jerome lindell president national football league players association
i have just left a meeting with representatives of the owners and i am sad to say that they have refused the players final demands which center around a rise
in the current salary cap
therefore i am recommending that all n
players walk out and not play until our demands are met
i want the players to walk out tall to walk out righteous to walk out in the knowledge that we do this as a team
we shall overcome the fat cats
i send peace to my union brothers
the entire locker room is silent for a beat
and then everyone starts getting dressed again maybe a little slower than before
shit im goin to vegas
as he sleeps peacefully
the only sound is the hiss of his oxygen
then we hear ice cubes sloshing in a glass
oneil opens his eyes and sees jimmy mcginty a handsome devil in his late sixties wearing golf clothes and sipping the last dregs of a scotch rocks
mcginty you look like shit
im dying jimmy
mcginty you been dying for twenty years
oneil motions to the glass
jimmy pours three fingers from a glenlivet bottle and hands it to him
mcginty that poof of a nurse of yours is gonna kick my ass if he catches you drinking
oneil removes his oxygen to sip his whiskey
he smiles as it goes down
gimme a butt
mcginty i quit
i want you to come back as head coach
i fired that asshole tilden today
mcginty im retired
and besides you dont have a team
they all flew home in their jets to their castles
were gonna finish the season anyway
all of us owners decided
were gonna use replacement players
mcginty youre a bunch of greedy bastards arent you
what about the god damn players
i got the highest payroll in the n
and they still want more
mcginty thats because youve been bottle feeding straight cash to these big babies for years
oneil sips his whiskey and calms down
no team owner in their right mind is gonna give back those t
all we promised fox was twenty two guys with a pulse every sunday
but think about it jimmy
we got a great opportunity here
we got a chance to put a team on the field that plays the game just for the love of it
like we used to play it
mcginty we also used to play without face guards
jimmy im really dying
the doctor says ill be gone by superbowl sunday
help me bring a winner back to d
you did it for me once before
you can do it again
mcginty listen i golf once a week with the president of the united states
i walk my grandkids to school every day
i got a young wife who will fuck me any time i want which frankly isnt too often but its comforting to know its there
i dont need it
wouldnt it be fun
a bunch of poor nobodies who play to win instead of a bunch of bitchy millionaires
you can put it together jimmy
players love you
they always have
mcginty pours more scotch and looks into the glass
tell me youre gonna do it
mcginty shut up im thinking
heres the deal you let me recruit who i want with no interference
mcginty im talking anybody i want
and no interference with my coaching either like you used to
sure jimmy sure
mcginty and one more thing no more notre dame stories
you start telling me notre dame stories and i pull your plug personally
i swear to god
mcginty is sitting behind the empty desk as his two main coaches give him a presentation
they are offensive coordinator leo pilachowski and defensive coordinator six phone lines with internet access on two one for defense and one for offense
we thought we would skip special teams for the moment
except for a kicker
we definitely need a kicker
a place kicker over a punter
the thinking being that if we lose the toss we have to be able to at least kick off
both coaches laugh nervously
mcginty doesnt say anything
heres the list of every player cut this past season
what we would like to do is
mcginty interrupting those people
pointing to list most of them were cut because they were shitty
mcginty takes out a piece of paper of his own with a bunch of names on it
mcginty were going to go another way here
ive done some scouting since i retired
on an ad hoc basis of course
and what i have here is a list of people ive kept an eye on
theyve all played football somewhere but only a few in the pros
and theyve all got something
unique to bring to the game
were gonna take these people and try to put together a winning team
and if nothing else they should be fun to watch
mcginty looks up when he senses someone standing in the doorway
its reese evans the veteran redskin we saw standing on the sidelines with the clean uniform
you wont need a center
mcginty how you doin reese
bored and ready to retire
im just looking for one more hit
one more really good hit
mcginty what about the strike
hell im rich
i got no complaint with mister oneil
i just want a chance to play one last time
shit id rather go out with a broken leg than sitting on the bench
mcginty nods to pilachowski
the coach takes a marker and fills in evans in the center circle
mcginty welcome to the new washington redskins
to his coaches lets find reese somebody to play with
a bunch of biker types are cooking up a vat of speed
these guys are big and badasslooking
after a beat one of the bikers looks up at the door
did you hear something
the other biker shakes his head no
the one who asked the question walks over to the door and listens for a beat
he turns to go back and suddenly the door disintegrates in front of a charging man wearing a police windbreaker
this is daniel bateman a big young psychotic cop who immediately runs over the poor biker who was listening at the door kicking the guy in the head as he
bateman dives on two more bikers and viciously head butts one of them
he stuffs the others head into the meth mixture pulls him out and clubs him with a big police blackjack three quick times rap
the guy goes down like lead
bateman looks around and spots a big biker cowering in a corner
the biker is terrified
bateman takes two stops toward the guy when suddenly three more cops wearing windbreakers run in out of breath
they look around at the unconscious bikers
why dont you ever wait for us
someones beeper is going off
the three cops look at theirs
the cowering biker looks at his
bateman pulls his beeper studies it and looks puzzled
what area code is
a loaf of wonder bread is spinning through the air in slow motion
it comes at us twisting and turning
hes tall maybe and positioned behind the cash register
hes wearing a washington redskins sweatshirt
cliffords hands are up as he waits to catch the bread which was tossed by his manager at the back of the store
the loaf hits cliffords hands and then bounces out
it lands on the counter in front of a ten year old smart ass kid
not amused what else
a pack of marlboro reds a pint of martel cognac and a box of trojans extra long
clifford grabs the kids two one dollar bills and makes change for the bread
get out of here
im telling your mother you were talking like that
the kid leaves
the manager yells from the back of the store as he holds up a portable phone
hey clifford somebody on the phone wants you to play football next weekend
tell em i gotta work saturday
and im watching the redskins on sunday
aint nothing stopping me from watching the redskins on sunday
mumbling no way thats gonna be happening me not watching the redskins on sunday
into phone hes gotta work
pause they said theyll pay you
on phone how much
pause ten thousand five hundred dollars
stunned ray who the fuck is on the phone
pause its the washington redskins
we hear deafening applause as we hold on andre and jamal williams two huge bodyguards dressed in identical black suits
suddenly the artist formerly known as prince comes off stage grabs a towel from an assistant and starts walking with jamal in front and andre in the rear
as they walk a cell phone rings
andre pulls it from his pocket and answers it quietly
jamal runs interference with the techies and groupies backstage
to someone get out of the way
to someone else dont look at him
he dont like being looked at god damn it
no eye contact
as they walk andre is still talking on the phone
finally they get to the backstage door and stop
the rock star prepares to run the gauntlet of adoring fans behind his trusty bodyguards
but his bodyguards are conversing quietly but urgently with each other
one of the assistants throws open the door
a big mob waits outside
the anointed one turns to his bodyguards to lead the way but
the mob surges
the artist formerly known as prince screams as hes trampled to death by his fans
shane falco wearing his patched wetsuit climbs out of his inflatable dinghy and flops onto the deck of his cabin cruiser
he looks cold and tired
you look like a swordfish i caught once
mcginty is sitting in an old deck chair on the stern of the boat
mcginty he hit the deck just like that
shane studies his visitor
and you look like that coach from the seventies
from the redskins
except you look a shitload older
mcginty the price of happiness
something to take the chill off
he offers shane an elegant flask
shane takes it and drinks
mcginty im running the redskins again
and i want you to quarterback em
no man ive been out way too long
mcginty what three years since san diego dumped you
youre in shape flopping around in the water like that
you know what my nickname was in san diego dont you
as in i hear em and i dump the ball
mcginty well you didnt have much of a line to protect you
i got two concussions to prove it
mcginty thats why girls dont play the game
mcginty drinks from his flask
mcginty i scouted you when you were playing at ohio state
i told san diego they were probably making a mistake when they signed you
truly shocked no kidding
mcginty oh you had a lot of tools a quick release
a scrambler by nature
good downfield vision
but you got hurt a lot
and worst of all you never could win the big game
what did you lose the sugar bowl by your senior year
what forty points
and now you want to recruit me
mcginty a scrambling quarterback is gonna do real well in this new replacement environment
and to tell you the truth i think i can help you with your biggest problem
whats my biggest problem
i think that sugar bowl took it all out of you
theres a beat as shane looks away
im retired from football
mcginty yeah and it looks like things have been going really well for you since
shane doesnt meet mcgintys eyes
i like being here
i like being alone
no screaming crowds thats for sure
pause you know what separates the winners from the losers
gettin back on the horse
the one that kicked you in the teeth
youre still young
you still got bags of talent
if you do well who knows what will happen when the strike ends
shane keeps staring out at the water
mcginty you want me to tell you youre not going to get hurt
you know you will
no doubt about that
mcginty points to the boats in the harbor
mcginty wouldnt you rather get hurt than scrape the shit off of other guys toys
were right off queens boulevard on a busy side street where lou pacifico is taking book
lou is short dark and handsome
he leans against the wall of a liquor store
deuce and an eightball on go down rita in the eighth
lou writes quickly on a small pad
after a beat another passerby leans in and whispers something to lou
lou writes quickly again
from across the street an old woman sticks her head out of a four story walk up
this is lous mother who speaks with a heavy italian accent
louis you got a phone call
from across the street who is it
its the washington foreskins
ma what are you out a your tree
yelling louder im telling you they said its the washington foreskins
people in the street are now starting to look up at this old woman screaming foreskins
louis quickly crosses the street to his apartment house
but at that moment a soccer ball bounces toward him from where a group of kids are playing in an alley
out of pure instinct lou gives it a mighty boot
we follow the arc of the ball as it sails down the block
everyone stops to admire the kick
still airborne the ball crosses queens boulevard
at that moment a very old mafioso type is being helped from his limo by several lieutenants
the ball hits the old guy right in the back of the head knocking off his porkpie hat and dropping him to the pavement like a bullet
the lieutenants pull pistols and surround their fallen leader
he sees what happens and quickly ducks into his apartment house
he spots lou before he disappears inside
coach roland lamont a good looking ex running back in his late twenties is coaching a high school player
we can see that roland is wearing a pretty substantial knee brace
he holds up a football
cut right on me now
right on me
he pitches the ball out to one kid who runs right at him steps on rolands foot with his cleats and then cuts around him
roland screams and falls to the ground
not right on me goddamn it
he writhes there a beat until he hears coach lamont
its the washington redskins
roland holds his foot and manages a smile because he seems to know what the phone call means
to the sky thank you lord
the stadium appears empty
suddenly a football thrown with a perfect spiral comes at us
we see the ball sail cleanly through a rubber ring attached to the crossbar on the goalpost
hes in shorts and a sweatshirt taking snaps from center reese evans
try a roll to the right
evans bends over another ball
shane sets up in the shotgun
shane footsteps falco
this is what youre going to build an offense around
mcginty is sitting with oneil on the fifty yard line twenty rows back
augustine holds oneils oxygen tank as the old man sits huddled in a coat thats way too big for him
christ jimmy i ask you to build me a team based on balls and the first player i see is footsteps falco
mcginty hes got as much natural talent as any quarterback in the league
and hes got the happiest feet ive ever seen
mcginty all he needs is a shot of self confidence
hes our quarterback
thats the way it is
what about a safety
we got two a days starting tomorrow and a game in five days
and we still dont have a safety
oneil motions to augustine for more oxygen
here we go
nice fat little hits
he turns the valve up
oneil breathes deeply
i called a friend of mine who just happens to be the governor of maryland
mcginty terrific the governor is going to play safety
dont worry about it
he drills a perfect spiral through the circle
a ramp at the rear of the stadium gives vehicle access to the interior
the bottom of this ramp is now a maelstrom of activity
the regular washington redskins are in a picket line walking in circles
the players are dressed in everything from fur coats to expensive leather jackets and leather pants
half of them are on cell phones
we can see some of their cars parked haphazardly nearby bmws porsches mercedes etc
jerome lindell the president of the players association is being interviewed on camera by a reporter
as president of the players association what does your presence mean here mister lindell
very simply support for these fine players and union men
is the home of freedom and the collective bargaining agreement
i am here to remind all americans that the owners are no better than the robber barons of the nineteenth century
they have blatantly gone out and hired scabs which is against all principles of our constitution and the declaration of independence and probably even the emancipation proclamation
the picketers start shouting and pointing
and here come the scabskins now
a bus slowly makes its way towards the ramp and the picketers
shane is sitting in the first seat with reese evans center
we move behind them and see among others daniel bateman psychotic cop clifford franklin cant catch a loaf of bread jamal and andre williams ex bodyguards lou pacifico kicker and
bookmaker and roland lamont ex high school coach
eggs start hitting the bus windows
we can hear the regular players chanting scabskins
hes very excited as he looks out the window at the striking players
roland lamont sits next to him
oh god theres eddie martel
and wilson jones
i love wilson jones
his big face looms right outside the bus window
he looks pissed off and scary
he leans across his seat to shane
hey lou pacifico
shane shakes his hand
i lost a ton a money on that sugar bowl disaster of yours
did you get your butt kicked or what
hes looking out the window when an eeg splats against it
he turns to his brother andre you know i dont take that shit
jamal reaches into his jacket and starts to pull out a nine millimeter pistol
andre stops him
a nondescript van pulls up and a muscled deadly looking guy in handcuffs and jail issue clothes gets out
this is bearded safety earl he aint no girl wilkinson
a maryland state trooper unlocks the cuffs
the replacements are getting off the bus as the players chant
when reese evans former redskin center gets off the bus the players go wild
reese coolly gives them the international suck my dick sign
clifford gets off behind him
he waves and smiles at the striking players
they throw rotten fruit at clifford in return
sid an oldtimer equipment man folds towels
behind him we can see helmets pads etc
mcginty walks up dragging shane who is fully dressed in a uniform including helmet
mcginty to sid what is this
mcginty points to the intricate face guard on shanes helmet
its an exaggerated version of a linemans cage with so much metal criss crossing that you can hardly see shanes face
mcginty hes a quarterback
how is he supposed to see
he told me he was a linebacker
i can see
mcginty holds up three fingers
mcginty how many fingers
andre and jamal are hitting the blocking sled simultaneously
they drive it out of frame
hes now wearing a helmet with a twobar quarterback face guard
he takes a snap and pitches out to running back roland lamont
roland now wearing a big knee brace looks sharp as he cuts to the outside
the offensive coordinator is standing with mcginty who is concentrating on the scrimmage
suddenly pilachowski spots someone
his mouth drops open
hes a fourhundred fifty pound ex sumo wrestler crammed into a redskin uniform
fat rolls are visible everywhere
oh my god
lee walks up
mcginty bows and says something in japanese
lee bows and answers back in japanese
then they shake hands
mcginty how you doin mickey
not bad coach
mcginty you look great
why dont you work out at left tackle
you got it
lee puts on his helmet pulls his ponytail out the back and rumbles away
pilachowski is looking at mcginty like hes crazy
youre not serious
mcginty i met mickey in hawaii
when he was even bigger
hes a sumo wrestler
that means hes an expert at pushing people around
thats what pass blocking is leo
defensive coordinator christopher banes comes running up in a lather
to mcginty i got a defensive end whos deaf
watching lee walk away ill trade you for a tackle whos gonna play in a diaper
how can i coach a deaf man
mcginty you dont have to
he looks across the field at a big good looking kid named brian murray who is in the middle of a pass rushing drill
murray looks really fast especially for his size
mcginty brian murray would have gone in the first round five years back if he hadnt been born deaf
i first saw him play right here in d
for galludet college
hes a hell of an athlete
you wont have to tell him anything
i cant believe it
i got to be able to communicate with him
mcginty then learn to sign
hey look at it this way hell never get pulled off sides on an audible
mcginty thinks this is funny as shit
hes just done a fivestop drop on a pass play
hes looking down field when he sees something scary
he throws the ball away and then is nailed and taken down on his back by bateman psychotic cop
shane groans and lies there with bateman on top of him
hi im danny
mcginty pulls bateman up
mcginty nice pop danny
danny runs off
what was that
mcginty danny bateman
ex cop ex marine ex rugby
hes absolutely harmless if you just play dead
mcginty helps shane up

youll live a lot longer
im very interested in that
is lined up at middle linebacker
when the play starts he runs headlong into four blockers and takes them all down with him
beats his man and turns as shane rolling out to his left puts the ball right on his numbers
franklin drops it
on the snap they pull to lead a sweep
unfortu nately each thinks the play is to their side
they forearm each other and then get into a fight
boots one from thirty five yards through the uprights
he smiles takes out a marlboro light and a bic and fires up
pulls up does a button hook and shane puts the ball in his hands
franklin drops it
the sumo guy hits the blocking sled and turns it over
is down on the ground viciously punching another player as two assistants try to pull him off
is in a crossing pattern in the end zone
shane puts the ball right in front of him
unfortunately it hits him in the hands
shane is sucking down water from the portable water cart when head cheerleader annabelle farrell walks up
shes dressed in tight workout clothes
annabelle farrell head redskinette
im in charge
of the redskinettes
oh yeah hi
ive been watching you

and i mean anything okay
shane is really not sure
they put you up at the hilton

she walks away
we watch her world class ass move across the gridiron
on mcginty and clifford franklin mcginty is holding a ball and talking to his wide receiver
mcginty because its a damn waste of all that speed clifford
i told you that when you were in high school
youve got to catch the ball son
this is the main idea of the passing game
i know coach i know
i assume that you have touched a woman in a romantic way have you not
oh yeah coach sure
in a you know romantic way
from here on out you touch this football all the time
he shoves the football in cliffords hands
mcginty just like you touch your girl friends
i better not see you without this ball
mcginty starts to walk away
can i still like touch my girl friends if i dont you know let go of the ball
mcginty thinks about that
mcginty yes clifford if you can manage that absolutely
andre and jamal are just about dressed
andre helps jamal on with his jacket
jamal then helps andre on with his
hes stripped down sitting on a bench
reporters are trying to interview him
microphones are in his face and video cameras jockey for position
just glad to be back playing
thats all ive really got to say
but where have you been
what have you been doing to make a living
ive been involved lately in the
mickey is watching roland unbuckle his big complicated knee brace
note there should be something slightly medieval about this brace
you only played one game
actually less than two minutes
i was a rookie third round pick in
we were playing atlanta in the home opener
near the end of the first quarter they sent me in i took a screen pass over the middle and got hit by both linebackers
one a side
my knee turned into wet toilet paper
end of career
can you play on it now
roland takes out a wrench and starts unscrewing a bolt on his brace
ive been teaching high school football for five years
its not a bad life
im good at it
there are some days when i actually love it
but for one more shot at this
id give it all up
this time theyre gonna have to take me out in a box
hes standing naked in front of his locker staring with anticipation at a garment bag
slowly he unzips the bag revealing a beautiful new suit
he touches the lapels reverently
hes sitting in front of a locker holding his football with a shit assed eating grin
someone walks by
i got wilson boones locker man
do you believe that shit
he drops his ball and quickly picks it up again
he looks around to make sure coach didnt see him
the regular redskins are out in force holding signs as they lean on their beamers and porsches
shane pulls up in a battered honda
when he gets out hes immediately surrounded by six striking regulars led by quarterback eddie martel and defensive end wilson jones
hey you cant park there
look i dont want any trouble
you dont want any trouble
youre taking my job away but you dont want any trouble
to wilson he doesnt want any trouble but he puts this piece of shit in a no parking zone
shane looks but its obvious hes parked legally
ill move it
no well do that for you
go ahead wilson
move it for him
wilson motions to another big guy
the two of them proceed to roll the honda over on its roof
it lands with a crunch
you all put that car back
everybody turns to see andre and jamal walking towards them
who the fuck are you
were the people who take care of the quarterback
were the guards
all the regulars laugh at this
put the car back
kiss my ass
to jamal its okay
no its not
jamal points to a gorgeous midnight blue porsche
to wilson thats your ride aint it
before wilson can even answer jamal pulls his nine millimeter
no more porsche windshield
all the regular redskins dive for cover
you crazy motherfucker
move his car back
jamal raises his gun again
no porsche drivers side window
he turns to his cowering teammates
come on help me god damn it
the guys quickly pick up the honda and put it right side up
to jamal you are gonna pay for this
no im not
and quit messing with my man here
that includes his ride
jamal spins the nine and holsters it
andre and jamal get on either side of shane
they look at each other and then quickly switch sides
lets go to practice shane
lets do that
shane smiles at his guards smiles at the still shocked redskins and they move out
shane dressed in pads and pants opens the door and walks in
during the opening and closing of the door we hear so if anyone does have any firearms we need to turn those in as soon as possible no questions asked
shane stands in front of the urinal and goes through the painstaking process of locating his dick
first he wrestles open his football pants and then has to deal with the cup etc
next to him at another urinal is walter cochran a big serious bornagain tackle
as he pisses walter has his bible propped open behind the flush handle so he wont miss a minute of scripture
praise the lord shane
walter pees for a beat
shane will you witness with me
will i what
will you witness with me
for this upcoming practice
by now shane is pissing too
praise the lord for giving us a way to eliminate shane
why not talk to him in the midst of performing his gift
walter takes his hand off his whizzing member and holds it out to shane
shane looks at walters hand for a long time but finally he removes his own guiding hand and clasps walters hand tentatively
they continue pissing as they hold hands
heavenly father thank you for allowing us to pee the poisons from our systems
please help us in todays practice to be strong and
mcgintys house day a barbecue is in progress for the new washington redskins at the beautiful home of coach mcginty
the huge back yard features a pool and a catered buffet barbecue
andre and jamal are loading down their plates
mickey lee is gnawing on a two foot slab of ribs
lou pacifico has a little three card monty going at a picnic table
coach mcginty is holding up a beautiful baby girl to the admiring players
he kisses the baby and then hands the child to his gorgeous young wife
augustine is pushing mister oneil in a wheelchair
they pass the outside bar and oneil suddenly lunges for a bottle of tequila
augustine has to rip it out of his hands
coach banes and earl wilkinson criminal are talking to a distinguished looking big man in his fifties
this is a d
circuit court where did you play judge
do i call you judge
your honor or judge is fine
i played at harvard
but i played in the days when you went both ways
offense and defense
when players were really tough
to wilkinson and where did you play college ball
im sorry what was your name again
wilkinson is smiling but he looks dangerous
i played at a junior college nobody ever heard of
what position did you play on defense judge
yeah big fellow like you thats what i would have guessed
it was a different game in those days
no tricks like today
you know maybe you can show me some of your technique your honor
maybe you can show me some of that toughness
id be glad to
theres an evil glint in wilkinsons eye
mcgintys house day shane is standing alone in a large hallway looking at an enormous trophy case stuffed with the spoils of football
you would think hes done enough
shane turns and sees her
shes as fetching as ever
mcginty i mean
i was kind of thinking the same thing
my theory is he came out of retirement to see if he could win with losers
pause oh shit
i didnt mean
interrupting hey its okay
ive been called worse
like after that sugar bowl game
i guess you could survive anything after that
shane has to actually smile at this
sometimes i feel like everybody in the world saw that game
like i could go to india and some little guy would run up to me and say boy did you suck in the sugar bowl
so how come youre such a fan
hes a huge redskin fan
hes in his twenty ninth year at the senate office building
as a guard not a senator
the only thing that keeps him going he says is me and the redskins
thats where i get it
my fan ness
suddenly are you scared
shane is totally taken off guard by this woman
anybody would be
but youre good
and youll do good
well thank you
look i gotta study the play book tonight
ill see you
break a leg tomorrow
its from the theater
for opening night
you say the worst thing that can happen
and it wont
break a leg
shane waves uncertainly and walks away
mcgintys back yard day the judge now with his jacket off and wilkinson are lined up across from each other in a three point stance in something called a man
the entire team forms two lanes on either side of them as they face off
the idea is to knock the other guy down and get by him
alright this is how we used to stop a running back
i cant wait
someone says hut
and wilkinson slams into the republican th circuit court judge and knocks him head over heels
the judge lands on his back wham
hes out cold
wilkinson slaps hands with andre and jamal
got me a judge
man that felt good
its another beautiful fall afternoon and cars are entering the stadium parking lot
at one of the entrances the striking redskins are picketing
jerome lindell nfl players president is still marching with them
a little boy stops one of the redskins and asks for an autograph on a program
the player gives it to him and the kid walks away
lindell runs after the kid grabs the program and rips off the page the player signed
to kid dont be asking for no autographs from the real players and then go in and watch the scabs
the kid retreats quickly
lindell rips up the page
to the player that is not the message we want to send our children
its very quiet
shane sits in pads and no jersey methodically squeezing a football
reese evans his center stops by
shane nods and gives a nauseous looking smile
remember to nod your head on the snap
out of it nod my head
for when murrays in
the deaf kid
he needs to look at you on the snap
shane nods that he understands but he goes back to staring at a wall
andre and jamal sit facing each other
andre throws a vicious forearm at jamals head but jamal catches it
they both nod in approval
lou pacifico smokes and stares
bateman is leaning against a wall fully dressed helmet on
hes staring into space and smiling to himself
he looks terrifying
earl wilkinson the criminal is polishing a beautiful pair of new alligator shoes
clifford franklin looks at himself in the mirror as he ceremoniously puts on his helmet
walter cochran is reading his bible in front of his locker which features a picture of jesus and a cross
mickey lee ex sumo is sitting in front of a bowl of hard boiled eggs
hes methodically popping them into his mouth
he eats four as we watch
coach pilachowski comes up to lee and watches him eat
what are you crazy
nobody eats right before a game
i always ate before a big match
i need the bulk
like a hole in the head he needs the bulk
coach mcginty comes strolling through the locker room the picture of calm
he walks by defensive end tight end brian murray and signs to him to have a good game
murray signs back thanks coach
cochran spots mcginty and puts down his bible
coach mcginty id like to lead the team in the pregame prayer
thats the problem with professional sports today too much god damn praying
five hundred dollar fine to the first man i hear praying
mcginty turns and bums an egg from mickey and walks to the middle of the locker room
he eats the egg as he turns slowly and takes in his players
mcginty a lot of people are waiting for you to fall on your asses today
and guess what
youre going to
but i dont give a shit if you look funny out there
or if you miss a block or drop a pass or trip over your own dick
this is professional
and the difference between professional and amateur between playing for the washington redskins and michigan state is simply
you are being paid to win
not just to play
not just to learn how to be good sports
not for the alumni
you are being paid to win
i dont care how the fuck you do it
but im demanding it
because those guys whose place youre taking have forgotten that simple fact
so go win it
he walks away
the players get up and start moving
were focused on an enormous plastic blow up washington redskin helmet that bobs on the ground in front of the exit to the field
the idea is the players will run into and then out of the helmet as they are introduced
annabelle and her fellow twenty cheerleaders are lined up on either side of the bobbing helmet waiting for the players
they are in their booth vamping on camera
pretty bold move by new england patriot owner victor kiam who went out and bought an entire semi pro team once the strike happened
redskin management on the other hand is going with a bunch of unknowns
their public relations people dont even have bios yet on most of their players although well see one or two familiar faces out there today
like shane falco the enormously talented college quarterback from ohio state who never fulfilled his potential in the pros
to madden wow remember that sugar bowl falco quarterbacked when florida state creamed them
oh yeah they were absolutely decimated
and if im not mistaken falco set a record in that game for bowl interceptions
anyway for some of these players this is another shot a last shot probably for a guy like falco
shane is looking out at the field through the blow up helmet
he looks scared
suddenly a cannon goes off with a stomach resounding boom
ladies and gentlemen your washington redskins
a sparse crowd is in attendance mostly diehard fans like todd rod and bob who are decked out in burgundy and gold
they look drunk already as they cheer like mad
heres the starting defense today
bateman is first in line
he looks like a racehorse on cocaine
at middle linebacker number daniel bateman
bateman takes off at a dead run out of the tunnel and into the helmet
it hits a wire stretched across the ground inside the helmet
he trips big time into the side of the helmet
he bounces its inflated remember
to the other side bounces again and is shot out of the front of it like a cannon ball
bateman bounces out of the helmet and takes out the first six cheerleaders
girls fly left and right
one girl is knocked out of her shoes
madden covers his face
summerall looks pained
even the hardcore todd rob and bob can hardly look at the carnage
a contingent of strike players like eddie martel and wilson jones huddle in the parking lot
they are laughing their asses off as they watch on a personal tv
cheerleaders are down and screaming in pain
annabelle is running from girl to girl doing triage
hes sheepishly standing to one side as trainers come out to assist
jamal and shane are examining the trip wire
obviously they were sabotaged
uh the rest of the washington redskins
the rest of the team walks unceremoniously out of the helmet and onto the field
the patriot kicker puts one in the end zone for a touchback
the ball is placed on the twenty as shane and the offense walk out onto the field
shane walks slowly toward the huddle thats forming
andre and mickey lee are arguing
thats where i stand
no its not
come on man thats my spot in the huddle
as he walks we hear mcgintys voice in shanes helmet
yes they do it by one way helmet radio so the filtered voice you hear is mcginty speaking into his headset mike
all right son nice and easy now
lets run our ten planned plays get a feel for the land
shane walks into the huddle and chaos
fat fucking nip
you dont know shit
what did you call me
you heard me you tub a rice shit
hold on whats the problem here
andre and lee ignore shane and start pushing each other
im gonna kick your black ass
you aint kickin jack shit
now jamal gets involved as shane tries to get between them
to lee dont be messing with my brother
hey hold on
hes watching the play clock and when it gets to zero he pulls his penalty flag and throws it
delay of game
lee suddenly punches andre through his face guard
andre knocks into shane and spins him around
jamal then goes to punch lee he misses and nails shane in the back of the helmet
shane goes down hard
they look confused
i dont know
something seems to be going on in the huddle
it looks like
yes shane falco is on his back
they havent run a play yet but falco is down
this is not a good sign
trainers race out to shane who is lying face up with the huddle standing over him
clearing the cobwebs what happened
am i hurt already
shane sits up
suddenly he remembers what happened
god damn it
i am the quarterback
i am the only one supposed to talk in the huddle
yeah but he took my place
i dont give a shit
shane gets to his feet
everybody leans in
if youve got something to say raise your hand
is that understood
lee raises his hand
shane grits his teeth and nods
suppose like you dont feel good
or youre hurt or something like that
then you tell me before the huddle starts
okay listen up blue east storm toss
jamal raises his hand
thats to the right
no its to the left
its to the right
you better be quiet shane theyll hear you
we do hear a whistle
a penalty flag flies by
delay of game
shane throws ups his hands
on mcginty hes talking into his mike
mcginty what the hell is going on
well pat so far the redskins have minus ten yards offensively
hes in bed sucking oxygen watching the game
augustine sits with him
turn it off
this is going to kill me
it breaks this time and everyone runs to the line of scrimmage
on the snap shane turns to head off to lamont but instead runs right into jamal who knocks him down
shane looks up at jamal
have you suddenly decided you dont like me jamal
you said it was to the right didnt you
shane leans in
lets try something simple
red left slot open
to jamal thats to the left
they break and shane lines up over his center
on the snap shane hands to lamont who sweeps left cuts inside and picks up eight yards
shane is ecstatic
and then a penalty flag flies by
shane looks at jamal who is trying desperately to hide his number
shane leans in with the next play
cochran playing right tackle cant resist
we should have prayed
solo right slot a y stick
they break and come to the line of scrimmage
twenty two green
shane does a play action fake to lamont and then turns downfield
hes buried by three defenders
the ball squirts loose and the patriots recover
hes livid on the sidelines
as his offensive line comes off he rants at them
shane hobbles off past the defense rushing onto the field led by bateman
washington comes up a minus fourteen yards on their first possession
they break their huddle and come to the line of scrimmage
bateman is snorting fire
earl wilkinson with smith on the back of his jersey patrols the secondary and calls out the formation
you got wide right
check on the wing
the patriot quarterback sets up over center
bateman runs offside and flattens the quarterback
penalty flags fly everywhere
defensive coordinator banes rolls his eyes
the ref moves the ball five yards and gives the offside sign
they come out of the huddle again
green eighty seven
bateman dives offside again and forearms the quarterback knocking him on his back
flags fly again
one patriot lineman makes the mistake of pushing bateman
bateman literally jumps on his head
more flags fly
banes is screaming something unintelligible at bateman
its marched downfield by the ref this time fifteen yards
over this we hear i think the redskins just set a record for penalties in the first three minutes
were waiting for the stats on that
here come the patriots again
rolls to his right but the blitz is on and he reverses and rolls left
hes finally cornered and has to dump the ball off
the pass is incomplete and hes knocked on his ass
fakes to lamont and rolls again
he fires a bullet to franklin on a down and out
clifford actually catches the ball then bobbles it and in trying to get possession again hands the ball to the defender
the defender cant believe it for a beat and then he streaks down the sideline and scores
c mcginty just shakes his head
scream in pain
rod pours his own beer over his own head
looks disgusted as he watches with augustine
grabs the opposing running backs face mask and spins him around and around
flags fly everywhere
is on the run again looking for a receiver
he finally throws the ball
right into the hands of the opposing safety
shane dives for the guy and misses
the safety scores
is trying desperately to get the crowd into the game by jumping up and down and waving her pom poms
five guys right in front of her get up from their seats take all their stuff and leave
shows the patriots up to
hes rolling in the back field again looking for a receiver
nothing but meat coming at him
shane panics and tosses the ball out of bounds
shane looks at mcginty on the sidelines
we hear mcgintys voice
you had lamont open in the flat
shane puts his head down like he knows it
come on now son
pick up your pace on the roll
see the big picture
pump and fake pump and fake
everyone is dirty sweating bullets and breathing very hard
shane leans into the huddle
lee is raising his hand
i dont feel good
and with that he promptly vomits sixteen eggs
man thats ripe
everyone is reacting
some players gag
shane we got to move
on the count of three
everyone more left
eleven bentover guys move in unison with tiny steps to their left
the guy watches the huddle moving
what the fuck is this
summerall has his binoculars on the moving huddle
john how many years have we been calling games together
seventeen i think
pat just hands john the binoculars
shane calls the play as they continue to move as one
u brown right west a lead
thats you mickey
puke on him if you have to
the huddle stops and they break for the line of scrimmage
he lines up face to face with the patriots defensive end
lee breathes in the guys face and the patriot gags
lee runs right over the guy
hes quickly followed by lamont with the ball
lamont runs for eighteen yards and a first down
hes waving for a substitute as he weaves off the field
very nice off tackle run by lamont
execution was letter perfect
that puts the redskins in field goal range
and here comes pacifico to see if he can get them on the board before the half ends
he flicks his smoke away as he runs out onto the field
a guy sitting at the bar turns his head quickly to the televised game when he hears pacificos name
this is the same mafioso type who saw lou kick the ball that knocked the godfathers hat off
he crouches down and waits for the snap from evans
pacifico lines himself up
this will be a forty five yarder
thats a tough distance for your first n
field goal try
its a perfect snap
shane spots it pacifico belts it
and it goes through for three
they begin immediately singing hail to the redskins a march always sung after a score
they and the sparse crowd in the stadium know and sing every word
he gets high fives all around
then bateman runs up and in his ecstasy slaps pacifico in the head
pacifico goes down knocked out cold
led by annabelle the girls are doing a stirring finale to hail to the redskins
everyone is lying on the floor
shane has ice bags on his head shoulder elbow and both knees
pacifico is getting smelling salts from a trainer as bateman hovers nearby waiting to apologize
mickey lee is chewing ice
cochran is reading his bible
mcginty walks in and bends down to shane
mcginty quietly you got to look for murray over the middle
you got to trust me on this hes a big tough kid with good hands
we cant put three plays together without a penalty a fumble of a fight
mcginty you still got a whole half left
youre a thoroughbred out there running against a bunch a nags
you can pick these fuckers apart
shane smiles through his pain
youre really good
the patriots have the ball
their quarterback drops back for a pass and throws it
earl is covering the intended receiver
he deftly steps in front of the guy and makes a diving catch
another terrific interception by smith
thats his second
madden starts shuffling through pages
yeah this guy is a player
he finds the paper hes looking for
according to the redskins ray smith
no college given no high school given
it just says hes been a resident of the state of maryland for the last four years and five months
likes to embroider
shane is walking toward the huddle
in his ear he hears mcginty v
o half your job is getting that huddle in the right mindset
use your imagination shane
shane stops short of the huddle
everyone is looking at him
there is a beat and then shane steps in
okay lets all take a few seconds to think about what we were doing for a living
just last week
shane looks around the huddle
everybody looks pained and or depressed
lets kick ass
red right pass x hook
they break the huddle and shane sets up over evans
he glances over at brian murray
murray is lined up in a three point stance at tight end
but his head is turned and hes looking directly at shane
shane nods on the snap
the front five in the persons of andre jamal reese mickey lee and cochran hit out and simultaneously knock their men on their backs
shane with plenty of time hits murray over the middle for twelve yards
shane looks over at the sidelines
mcginty is smiling
is under pressure but he rolls smoothly and rockets the ball downfield
murray pulls it in for fifteen yards
rolls left off the shotgun fights off a cornerback and throws back across field complete to lamont coming out of the backfield
is calling for a fair catch on a punt
he catches the ball but bateman flies into frame and decks him
are blocking side by side pushing their men back as lamont squeezes through with the ball
is pass blocking like the all pro that he is
he knocks his man flat and then doubles up on cochrans man
is pursuing a running back
he knocks down an official and runs right over him
then he gets his hands on the running back and pushes him out of bounds and then knocks over a photographer
pumps once and then drills a twenty yard spiral
clifford franklin beats his man and dives for the ball
he bobbles it and then squeezes it to his stomach as he hits the ground
madden uses his pen on the screen to try to explain a play
there are already lines everywhere
began with a redskin end around but cochran the pulling tackle ran into falcos pitchout
right here it bounced off his helmet
then it was kicked by landon and then hayes touched it i think and then green got a hand on it and then bellinski recovered it and then he lost
it and finally the ball took a crazy bounce right back into falcos hands look at his face here
hes as surprised as anybody
falco then ran it back to just about the original line of scrimmage executed the same play an end around to murray and the skins score
welcome to strike football
he boots the extra point
scoreboard patriots redskins
were on the clock which shows one minute ten seconds left in the fourth quarter
it breaks and comes to the line of scrimmage
shane drops into the shotgun
shane rolls left but theres a blitz
the cornerback is almost on him when shane shifts and rolls the other way
hes wide open five yards from the goal line
theyre breathing down his back
he sees franklin and cocks his arm
suddenly opposing jerseys are everywhere
shane dumps the ball
hes immediately decked by a defensive end
we watch the flight of it in slow motion
we follow it right into the hands of
a new england patriot defensive back
hes down and not moving
they scream in despair
she falls to her knees in pain
falco is intercepted
thats too bad
yeah and it looks like hes hurt too
he was really starting to put it together here in the fourth quarter
only forty eight seconds now left on the clock
hes helped off the field and onto the bench
on mcginty he grabs bateman before he can run out onto the field
very slowly get me the ball
he runs out onto the field
they line up
hut hut hut
the quarterback hands off to the running back right up the middle in a typical run out the clock play
bateman comes out of nowhere decks the runner and literally rips the ball out of his hands as he goes down
they go wild
she does a cartwheel
on mcginty hes leaning over a groggy shane on the bench
mcginty dont shake your head at me
you are going back in there
you are gonna run the same god damn play you are gonna throw the ball to franklin again and this time hes gonna score
mcginty grabs some smelling salts from a hovering trainer
he shoves them under shanes nose
shane is suddenly very awake
mcginty you are the only one in this entire stadium who can do it
do you understand me
you can do something no one else can do
so start right here
start living your destiny
or give it up for good
shane stares at him
then he stands up wobbles and puts on his helmet
theyre all turned and watching as shane makes his way slowly out onto the field
annabelle watches him closely
here comes falco with eighteen seconds left on the clock
im surprised to see him again after that shot he took from bellinski
it breaks and shane stands over evans and looks out at the defense
nasty looking linebackers and cornerbacks stare at him
his voice cracks and several defensive players openly laugh at him
shane gets an idea
hes down in a three point stance facing a defender
he whispers to reese whats that mean
whispering back hes changing the play
its a long count
falco could be calling an audible
he shifts position in the backfield
to shane is this right
shaking his head black left
lamont shifts again
clifford goes in motion from his flanker position but then changes his mind and goes back the other way
lamont and clifford then bump into each other
they are totally confused now as they try to adjust to the equally confused redskins
on mcginty he looks extremely pissed
he turns to hand the ball off to lamont but lamont is not there
shane turns the other way and sees lamont just standing there looking at him
shane runs over to him and hands him the ball
meanwhile the patriot defense is going the other direction
lamont takes off
one cornerback is not taken in
the guy dives for lamonts legs
we hear a clank as the cornerbacks helmet hits lamonts industrial knee brace
the guy bounces off and lamont trots into the end zone
falco calls an audible at the line of scrimmage and lamont takes it in
shane meanwhile is looking at mcginty on the sidelines
in shanes helmet i guess you saw something i didnt
shane nods vigorously
dont try to bullshit me pal
you didnt want it
winners always want the ball with the game on the line
you know that
shane looks down
the play is
waggle right drag hook
he looks ten years younger as he and augustine watch
with eight seconds remaining pacifico will try the extra point that will send this game into overtime
this turned out to be one hell of a contest pat
he sets up for the kick
he waits for the snap
he sets up at his flanker position
shane catches the snap and pitches the ball out to murray from his holding position
its a fake
the patriot right defensive end breaks through and reaches for murray
the only person in his way is shane still kneeling in the holding position
shane screams as the huge lineman trips over him and then falls on him
murray sweeps around the right side and scores untouched
everybody goes nuts
he pounds on augustine
they pound on each other
hail to the redskins is deafening
on mcginty he just smiles
hes still under the defensive end
reese evans pulls the guy off and bends down to shane
we won shane
shane manages a painful smile
its packed with players friends and assorted groupies
pacifico is smoking and talking non stop to a group who hang on his every word
andre is already passed out at a booth
jamal supports one side of andre so he doesnt fall over
murray is signing to several fans who sign back
clifford franklin signs autographs
earl wilkinson dressed to the nines is dancing close and slow with a gorgeous woman
shane is at the bar and hes not in good shape
hes got cuts and bruises visible and every time he moves he grimaces
the martinis are starting to help however
hes talking to a stunning woman in red
ultimately its a pain thing you know
i mean its darwinian the survival of the numbest
whoever can take the pain most gets the largest contract
he finishes his martini and throws the olive over his shoulder
let me buy you another
she signals to the bartender
i dont know how you do it
i hate pain
pain is a no no as far as im concerned
shane gets his new drink takes a sip and visibly slumps at the bar
slurring im glad that you are concerned
hey are you alright
ill take you up to your room if you like
shane looks at her closely
i would like
shane weaves down the hallway with the woman in red
they stop at a door
shane fumbles for a key
another stunning looking woman suddenly appears from down the hall
this is the a friend of mine is going to join us okay
ready to party
she checks the hallway takes the key from shane and sticks it in the lock
looking at both women oooooh
and youre the book baby
suddenly annabelle farrell appears in the hallway
to the girls go away
both of you
annabelle punches her in the nose with a straight right hand
the girl bounces off the wall
to annabelle these are my guests
now bleeding you crazy bitch
both girls take off
why did you do that
annabelle opens the door
you were about to be rolled
as he enters thats what i was hoping
annabelle is pulling the bed down as shane falls into a chair
they work the bar downstairs looking for drunk redskins
shane looks embarrassed
i guess they found one
dont feel so bad
its a rookie mistake
she turns and sees that hes already passed out
she looks at him not unkindly
then she unbuckles his belt and starts pulling his pants off
as he opens his eyes
he rolls over and screams in pain
shes wearing nothing but a redskins t shirt
she quickly bends over him
groaning what is it
its for the pain
its only a little bit illegal
shane takes it and swigs a glass of water
ive got to go to the bathroom
its far away isnt it
well just take our time
she helps him get out of bed
when he stands he screams again
my hair hurts
you took a hell of a beating
the martinis didnt help either
she walks him to the bathroom like an old man
he shuffles in and closes the door
dont be afraid if youve got blood in your urine
did you undress me
slept here with me
are you kidding
you were catatonic
he appears again at the door
back to bed
he leans on her as she walks him back
he gets into bed with a moan
may i ask you a personal question
do you do this for all redskin quarterbacks
of course not
then why me
annabelle takes her time answering
i dont know
i guess i cant resist a man who can take a hit
i cant take a hit
annabelle cradles his head
its all in your head
now get some sleep
annabelle walks up to shanes door with a stack of newspapers
the bathroom door is closed
annabelle talks to him anyway
youre the golden boy in the press this morning
she reads a headline
falco scores big
to herself well
still reading hey a lot of the regular players are starting to cross the picket line
it doesnt say
shane comes out of the bathroom dressed and ready to go
hes still moving slowly and in great pain
where are you going
mcginty called a dinner meeting with the whole team
shane tries to put on his coat but hes so sore he cant
annabelle helps him
you saved my life
probably just your wallet and your watch
and that pill that sure worked
youre basic double d vicodin
but be careful its habit forming
the best stuff always is
theres another awkward silence
ice both knees and that shoulder before bed
clifford still carrying his football comes out of his apartment in a third floor walk up
hes wearing his redskins jacket
as he turns around from locking his door he stops dead in his tracks
all of cliffords neighbors all the way down both halls are standing in front of their doors
they all start applauding
clifford smiles from ear to ear
are trying to hail a cab on wisconsin avenue
suddenly one cab then two then four slam on their brakes
cabbies hop out to open their doors for the brothers
walks down g street with brian murray
brian spots something in a store window and stops roland
roland gasps as he sees himself duplicated on ten tv screens in an appliance store
hes on tape being interviewed at a redskins practice
dressed in casual chic is moving quickly through lord and taylors department store with two sales clerks in tow
he stops grabs four cashmere sweaters smells them hands them to one clerk and moves on
is standing in front of the white house
he has a line of ten people who are paying five bucks for an autographed picture of himself that he hands out from a huge stack
we see shane walk in the door
the scabskins are all being served dinner in a private room
mickey lee is served a steak the size of a briefcase
andre and jamal get lobsters big enough to be pets
ed oneil is being fed pureed asparagus by augustine
when augustine drops the napkin and bends over oneil whispers urgently to cochran who is enjoying a steak ill give you thousand dollars for a bite of that steak
mcginty taps his glass at the head of the table and stands
mcginty alright listen up there have been a lot of rumors about the regular players crossing the picket lines
they are not rumors
many union players have now seen the error of their ways and are coming back in droves
apparently they have been struck with the realization that it is a blessing to be playing professional football
there is dead silence in the room
everybody thinks its over
mcginty but they had their chance
now its your turn
mister oneil and i have agreed to ban all striking players and to continue to go with you guys
theres a beat and then everyone breaks into cheers
suddenly the door flies open and a reporter and a cameraman step in and start filming
the reporter shoves a microphone at mcginty
coach what will be your strategy against new york this sunday
out in the restaurant patrons see the players and a few break into hail to the redskins
suddenly the whole restaurant starts singing
shane looks embarrassed
pacifico stands up on his seat and conducts the singing
andre and jamal hold their lobsters in the air and make them dance to the song
were on a television showing pacifico conducting and the entire restaurant singing
eddie martel redskin quarterback is watching the scene at home on the late local news
the palm patrons showed an impromptu appreciation tonight for the new washington redskins
they may be unknowns and far from superstars but it sure looks like they have charmed the fans
martel looks very angry
shane answers his door
annabelle is standing there
she gives him a bottle of pills
we dont travel with the team
so heres tylenol with codeine regular vicodins the magic bullet one that i gave you before and a couple of darvons if you actually break something
pop em in the ambulance
ill be watching on tv
the giants got back three of their four defensive linemen
plus their middle linebacker
what can i say
go from the shotgun and scramble your ass off
shane smiles at her
she suddenly grabs him and they kiss big time
then she breaks and walks quickly away
shane doesnt know what to make of this
were down on the field in the middle of a play
shane is running away from three new york giant defensive linemen
shane is not even looking for a receiver
hes looking to save his life
finally hes caught by a six foot five two hundred and seventy pound defensive end named hank morris who throws him down and lands on top of him
in shanes ear hello again
theyre back in their booth calling the game
thats all pro hank morriss third sack his second here in the fourth quarter and the sixth of the day for the giants
falco is gonna be sore tonight
if he can stay alive that long
ten three new york in what has turned out to be an incredible defensive duel
jerome lindell is once again outside the stadium picketing with a smaller group of players
he does his interview on camera standing in front of a huge semi truck
and a big overweight truck driver stands next to him
because its about brothers and brotherhood and standing together against the oppressors
thats why i am so grateful to our teamster brothers who have joined us here today in new york to protest the greed squad known as the n
the truck driver suddenly pumps his arm and a its deafening but lindell smiles through it all
shane is rolling out with morris on his heels again
he cant find anyone open and runs out of bounds
everybody is breathing hard beat up and exhausted
shane leans in
to reese evans you got to double up on morris
hes too far outside for me to get to him
to cochran bring him down and sit on him
hes been beating the crap out of me all day
i feel like a rag doll out here
ill help this time
spread left a right roll right half back sail
shane sets up in the shotgun
on the snap lee and cochran double team morris
morris slaps cochran away like well a rag doll and then confronts the sumo master
he bumps stomachs with lee
lee flies through the air and lands on his ass
he spots his receiver he cocks his arm and wham
morris decks him
and of course lands on him
to shane its just me fuck face
in order to get up morris puts one huge hand on shanes helmet and pushes himself up
shane moans as his face guard digs a four inch hole in the turf
on mcginty hes talking into his mike
mcginty you want a time out
that looks like it hurt
shane gets up
hes got a huge piece of turf stuck in his face guard so that for a beat we cant even see him
then he pulls out the dirt and grass and we see shane really pissed off for the first time
everyone gathers around
to lee and cochran let him in
dont touch him
let him through
they break the huddle
shane goes into a shotgun
shane does a three step drop from the shotgun
cochran and lee hit out on either side of morris giving him a clear shot at shane
morris comes hard and fast
shane looks downfield winds up turns and fires the ball at morriss head
the ball goes like a bullet for five feet and then sticks like a dart in morriss face guard
for a moment morris is blinded
and shane is dumbfounded
then morris starts to wrestle the ball out of his mask
andre and jamal grab onto morris who starts stumbling down field with the ball still stuck in his helmet
the ball is stuck in his face
but morris wont go down
hes still trying to pry the ball loose as he throws off jamal
then he shakes off andre
hes in slow motion in midair diving towards morris
its absolutely quiet hes deaf remember
as he soars towards morriss head helmet and ball
murrays full body weight hits morris in the helmet which flies off and rolls across the field with the ball still stuck in it
out of the silence we suddenly hear the hit and the crowd roar
morris goes down like a building with murray buried in his throat
todd rod and bob are destroying todds den in reaction to the hit
annabelle is screaming whoa
to that hit
theyre watching on tv
now thats a hit
its in the very chubby hands of mickey lee who is rumbling downfield with the fumble helmet recovery
new york players have been slow to pick this up because they too have been admiring the lick that murray put on morris
suddenly the whole team is chasing lee
they catch him pretty easily at the twenty but lee represents a lot of weight
lee staggers across the ten shaking players off left and right
one defensive halfback sacrifices himself and throws himself at lees feet
lee trips over the guy gains his footing again walks on the guy who screams in agony and falls into the end zone carrying three players with him
john is beside himself
i love to see a fat guy score
he gets up in jubilation spikes the ball helmet combination and runs through the back of the end zone
but he doesnt stop
hes aiming for a low wall that separates the first row of fans from the field
they see mickey rumbling at them and they all get the picture at the same time
he launches himself into the stands in ecstasy
lee lands on all four of them
its hiked into shanes hands and pacifico boots the extra point
giants redskins time remaining seconds
murray and lee are getting congratulations from everyone
to murray what a hit
slower what a hit
murray nods that he understands
to murray im proud of you kid
jamal and andre are hugging lee
in the b
we can see paramedics lifting one of lees four fans onto a stretcher
youre the one youre the one youre the one
you think thats worth a shoe deal
mcginty walks into the middle of it
mcginty stop with the lovefest
lets get the goddamn ball back and win this thing
were close on bateman as he lines up for the kick off
everybody in the stadium knows that an on side kick is coming
bateman is standing in the hot spot for recovering the ball
shane and everyone with decent hands is on the field
pacifico lines it up and boots it ten yards
the ball takes a crazy hop hits a giant and ricochets off him
bateman runs over two guys and grabs the ball on the bounce
hes got it
but bateman doesnt go down
he turns and starts running across the field
shane runs after him
danny go down
youre using up the clock
but bateman likes this new job kick off returner
especially after he runs over a giant and stiff arms another
bateman is finally trapped on the far sideline after gaining perhaps eight yards
so he turns and starts running back the other way
shane has been chasing him and now sees bateman running back at him
shane has no choice but to throw himself in front of batemans legs
bateman goes down
shane jumps up to ref time out
bateman looks up at shane
beautiful tackle shane
now thats something you dont see everyday
bateman has burned up most of the clock
eighteen seconds remain
mcginty shane and pacifico confer
we got time for one play but if we dont get it out of bounds the game is over
mcginty yeah but youre looking at a sixty five yard kick from here
smoking a butt no problem
to shane you hold it
ill kick it
mcginty looks at shane and they both shrug
mcginty what the fuck
madden cant believe it
i cant believe it
mcginty is gonna let pacifico try the field goal from sixty five yards out
hey john this kid has got a heck of a foot
but sixty five yards
hes set up to receive the snap
pacifico lines himself up the way soccer style kickers do
then he takes a drag on his smoke and flicks it away
did he just
i think that guy is smoking on the field
no i think you imagined that one john
shane looks at pacifico and his clean uniform
then shane looks at his own uniform which is covered with blood dirt and grass stains
pacifico looks clean
you look great lou you know that
pacifico is really touched
that means a lot to me
shane turns to evans who smiles at him between his own legs
the snap is perfect
pacifico boots the shit out of it
end over end yard after yard it flies straight and true
its straight enough
if its got the distance its
the ball hits the crossbar and goes over
everybody goes crazy
players are pounding on pacifico
but pacifico is desperately looking around for someone
he spots him its bateman running flat out across the field to congratulate him
pacifico runs for his life
after a beat the door opens and annabelle is standing there rubbing her eyes
shes wearing a cut off redskin jersey
are you hurt
youre getting used to being slapped around
thats a good sign
nothing comes out
would you like to come in and make love
im here because
i dont want to be alone
most of the world feels that way
you dont have to be embarrassed about it
but to tell you the truth
im kind of scared of you
annabelle takes that in and thinks about it
i wont hurt you
she takes his hand and leads him inside
annabelle is giving shane a slow sensuous full body massage
its lucky for us hes on his stomach
shane does a lot of moaning as annabelles fingers work their magic
she gets to a place on his shoulder thats especially tender
he moans even louder
that shoulder is going to need special handling
annabelle pulls her jersey off and gently presses her breasts into shanes back
shane puts a pillow over his head to drown out the ecstasy
after a beat he pulls the pillow away
you know what hurts worse than my shoulder
i cant imagine
their defensive end punched me in the mouth
annabelle starts laughing
its killing me
annabelle is laughing hard now as shane rolls over
shane and annabelle are in a close after sex kind of cuddle thing
shane is unburdening himself
after that game after being beaten that badly in front of the whole country after humiliating myself my team my school my family i mean did you know that i
set two sugar bowl records
i was sacked eleven times
i threw six interceptions
anyway after that i could never seem to adjust in the pros
i was too scared
i lost my balls
we see annabelles hand move slightly under the covers
well theyre back
you know what i mean
i lost the edge you need to play this game
i dont believe that
i dont think it just goes away
it was only one bad day shane
everybody has those
somehow i convinced myself that i couldnt ever win the big game
i got so down that i was afraid to be playing when a game was on the line
i was afraid to screw up
thats the sure sign of a loser
from there it wasnt very far to thinking that ill never win that i didnt deserve to win at anything
youre winning now
youre winning me
they kiss real good
its a huge town house in foggy bottom
its entrance is now lined with reporters
one is speaking on camera to his anchor
bob im standing in front of redskins owner edward frances oneils home and all we know right now is that the washington player previously known as ray smith is in
fact earl samuel wilkinson
we see two photographs of earl one with his current beard and the other his clean shaven mug shot of five years ago
the all pro miami safety who was serving five to seven years in the maryland state penitentiary for three counts of aggravated assault
as you may recall one of those counts was against a baltimore city police officer and resulted in that officer being hospitalized for quite some time
hes doing his sports segment from the studio
any idea how wilkinsons identity was discovered and who leaked it to the media
no bob but rumor has it that the national football league players association had something to do with it
in other n
news almost sixty percent of the regular players have now crossed the picket lines and more are crossing every day
the strike now in its second week is expected to go out with a fizzle
most experts think that the monday night dallas washington game will be the last with replacement players
but even that game will feature at least percent of the regular cowboys
coach james mcginty will try to make it a perfect three and o with a team made up totally of replacement players
and one felon
pause that we know of
mcginty stares out the window at the reporters as augustine feeds oneil soup
mcginty stop worrying
doesnt care if he played under an assumed name
everything was legal
he was let out on a work release program
hell be kept under house arrest but hell still be able to play
where are we gonna keep him
mcginty in the stadium
well fix up something comfortable for him and hell get his exercise by kicking the shit out of n
how did you pull that off
mcginty how else
with your money
to augustine take this cow piss out of here
you used to love asparagus soup
they say that when the taste buds go youre at the beginning of the end
augustine leaves with the tray
mcginty i want to keep falco after the strike ends
as martels back up
lets keep em all
the hell with the regulars
mcginty youve got to take the union players back once the strike ends
its part of the collective bargaining agreement
the hell i do
let em sue me
mcginty theyll do worse than that
theyll close down the stadium
god damn em
then you got to beat dallas
the whole country will be watching
all those millionaires down there deserve to have their noses rubbed in it
mcginty ed lets be honest beating dallas is gonna be a hell of a trick
you can pull it off
you proved that winning doesnt have to look pretty
these boys are hungry for it jimmy
theres nothin more dangerous in all of sports than a hungry team
i remember back in we were playing nebraska in the mud
mcginty interrupting ed im begging you no notre dame stories
okay jimmy okay
but you beat dallas for me and then ill go gently into that night
were on mickey lee who is wearing his redskin game jersey with no pads
hes stuffed into a cadillac brougham a big ass version of the caddy
hes talking directly to us
youll score too with a cadillac from coleman cadillac
its a big car for a big man
mickey is very wooden as a spokesperson
he tries again
same thing youll score too with a cadillac from colemans cadillac
its a big car for a big man
thats good mickey thats real good
lets try it again
mickey looks game
andre jamal brian murray roland lamont daniel bateman lou pacifico and shane are standing outside the stadium after practice
they are all mobbed by autograph seekers
all of them are signing as fast as they can
the guys are on the grounds of the washington monument
they are lined up against a bunch of little kids
shane takes the snap
the ball is a miniature rubber football
all the linemen fall down
the kids blitz and sack shane for a big loss
annabelle watches and laughs and claps
still crammed into the cadillac
he looks exhausted and pissed
in a monotone youll score too with a cadillac from coleman cadillac
its a big car for a big man
that was good
lets try it again
im not doing it again
who are you orson welles
this is nuts
lee tries unsuccessfully to get out of the car
are lined up in redskin jerseys minus pads
its team picture day and everyone looks happy to be there
shane walks down the hall to his room
he walks in and closes the door
when he turns around eddie martel ex washington redskin quarterback is sitting on shanes bed
two defensive linemen types stand by the window
this is a visit
who let you in
i used to nail one of the housekeepers
pointing to the linemen you know who these guys are dont you
youll be seeing a lot of these guys tomorrow
what do you want
but these boys wanted a little head start on you
theres a beat and then shane suddenly bolts for the door
but the two linemen grab and hold him
im flattered that you actually think we have a chance to win
it can be a game of luck
and under no circumstances can we allow a scab team to go three and o
especially against the dallas cowboys
its just not good for the game
is the union behind this visit
i cant really say shane
by the way have you ever tried throwing a football with bruised ribs
he kicks shane viciously in the side
the pain makes it damn near impossible
the linemen drops shane on the floor
and one other thing i want you to stay away from annabelle
shane is gasping on the floor
the sad fact is she wont give me the time of day
but you cant have everything i want
i cant let that happen
so you gotta stop seeing her
just on principle
martel viciously kicks shane again
let me hear you say it
shane is trying to get his breath
you can do it
barely visible i wont go out with her anymore
to the linemen gentlemen
to shane hey have a great game
they move toward the door
once again fans stream into the parking lots
in a corner of a lot jerome lindell is once again holding forth on camera
but this time hes standing with a hard looking guy in a suit named matheson
i think that mister matheson here and myself are very close to an agreement that will put the pro back in pro football
mister matheson what are the sticking points in the negotiations as far as the owners are concerned
only one that the players immediately go back to work with no change in the existing contract
lindell looks uncomfortable
but he smiles anyway
the familiar monday night football theme song is just ending
al michaels does his on camera intro
good evening from the big o here in washington d
where the mighty dallas cowboys take on the cinderella washington scabskins as they have come to be known
hi im al michaels and we are witnesses to a unique matchup tonight as shane falco and a contingent of strike players go up against the entire regular squad of
the dallas cowboys
yes you heard right every cowboy has now crossed the picket line some as late as this afternoon and they will all play tonight
can a rag tag group of hasbeens and castoffs stand up to what was once called americas team
and what about the strike itself
it has been so ineffective that many predict it will be over before this game ends
stay tuned as boomer and dan join me for strike ball d
eddie martel wilson jones and other regular redskins take their seats on the fifty yard line
everyone is just about dressed in their uniforms and ready to go
lou pacifico enters in street clothes and starts undressing quickly
he looks worried
shane watches lou for a beat
we see shane shift his upper body and grimace
mcginty enters and pulls shane aside
youre staying on after the strike
shane smiles in spite of the pain
mcginty its probably better that you not say anything to the rest of the guys until after the game
whatever you say coach
mcginty walks into the middle of the locker room and goes into pre game speech mode
mcginty alright listen up
the strike is just about history
by tomorrow you will no longer be redskins
its important that you leave here however with the knowledge that you have made a difference in your own life in the owners life or whats left of it and
especially the fans
you have proven to a skeptical america that sports is not about contracts or agents or shoe deals
sports is about rising to the occasion
we have one more opportunity tonight to do that one more chance to show what heart is all about
the dallas cowboys are waiting out there to kill you
i expect nothing less than for you to win even in your death throes
we have a powerful weapon on our side tonight there is no tomorrow for most of you
and that makes you very dangerous people
pacifico belts the kick off deep into the end zone
the three hosts sit in shirtsleeves and ties headphones on
that is one very big leg on lou pacifico
hes a big reason why this strike team is two and
but the fact is a kicker does not an offense make
i think tonight the scabskins will have a very rude awakening
but you have to admit dan falco is proving to be the real thing
well boomer no i dont have to admit anything
rolling his eyes here we go
everybody laughs politely
earl wilkinson flattens a dallas punt returner
hes now wearing a jersey with his real name on the back
bob is dressed in a striped convict suit with wilkinsons number on it
he gets high fives from todd and rod for wilkinsons hit
he walks out onto the field to join the huddle
he turns and sees a smiling annabelle
shane gives her a guilty wave and then cringes with the pain of just having to lift his arm
the redskins line up
cochran is opposite butler the big tackle that visited shanes room
to butler i just want to say what an honor it is to play opposite you
and if its not too much trouble i would love to have your autograph
on the snap butler bashes cochrans head with his forearm and knocks his helmet off
then he runs over him
he under throws a very weak looking pass to lamont
shane grits his teeth against the pain
hes dazed and still on the ground
butler walks over and bends down to him
im gonna autograph your body with bruises you scab ass son of a bitch
shane is in the backfield once again running for his life
hes rolling left with butler on his heels
he throws another weak incomplete pass to murray
shane is crushed by butler after he throws the ball
hows that side feel
grimacing like christmas morning
butler leans on shanes side as he gets up
shane gasps with pain
on mcginty hes watching shane closely
then he talks into his mike
mcginty whats the matter with your arm
are you alright
theyre watching the replay on their monitor
dan is very happy
butler never gave up on him
thats a pound guy who moves like a halfback
dan i think butlers hit on falco was late to tell you the truth
well of course you do
you were a wimp quarterback
the dallas kicker puts away the extra point after a score
is under pressure as he rolls out
when a defensive lineman gets close he throws the ball away like weve seen him do before
a defensive back intercepts
the ball goes through the uprights for a dallas field goal
massages oneils feet as the old man watches the game
he looks worried
smokes and stalks the sidelines
he looks up into the stands and sees the mafioso type looking down at him
steps up in the pocket
he looks downfield but in the face of the pass rush he throws the ball weakly out of bounds
is pass blocking but the first guy spins him around and the second guy runs right around him
is double teamed on a pass rush
he spins but he can get no leverage against his opponents
when the play ends he pushes one of them
a penalty flag flies by
takes a pitch out is immediately hit hard and loses the ball
a cornerback picks it up and takes it all the way for a dallas score
steps up and bats a ball away from a dallas receiver
a flag flies
wilkinson argues the call
is lined up across from butler
on the snap butler slaps cochran in the face mask with his big fat club of a hand
cochran disappears out of frame
the dallas kicker puts away the extra point after a dallas touchdown
sitting in the stands look satisfied
the redskins huddle
shane is in pain
he looks up at the clock
theres thirty two seconds left in the half
red right x hook
the break the huddle and come to the line of scrimmage
shane rolls right and looks downfield
he holds the ball and keeps rolling
no one can get open
suddenly lamont cuts in front of him and yells shane
lamont sees an open lane and shane follows him
he eats up yards before two defensive halfbacks close in
lamont throws an incredible block and takes out both guys
shane blows by and heads for the end zone
only a safety stands between shane and pay dirt
his side is killing him with every step he takes
when the safety moves up on him shane panics and goes down in the same kind of slide that eddie martel did in the beginning
the gun sounds and the half ends
shane sees redskin trainers running out onto the field
he turns and sees lamont rolling on the ground in pain as he holds his bad knee
the boys are doing their half time stand up
thats the end of the first half and not surprisingly it was all dallas
the cowboys had over two hundred yards offensively versus washingtons frankly pathetic thirty eight yards
thats total offense
falco got close to scoring on the last play of the half but he appeared to have slipped
by the way running back roland lamont was hurt on that play and word is hes on his way to the hospital
al the battle is being fought and won in the trenches
you cant expect a bunch of pick up players to stand up to a professional pass rush like the cowboys
theres still a whole half left dan
and remember falco is proving to be a second half quarterback
you got to be kidding
those big fat boys in the trenches get awful tired
you ought to know that dan
okay lets join chris berman with our half time show
after a beat we hear clear
whats wrong with you guys
he started it
i did not
you called me fat
i did not
but you are
dan reaches across al and grabs boomer by the throat
the three of them start wrestling in the booth
everyone is nursing a bruise or some sort of wound
shane is nowhere to be seen
mcginty walks into the middle of the locker room
mcginty alright listen up the strike is officially over
theyre announcing it on tv right now
so this is it gentlemen
we have one half left to keep from being totally humiliated
you are better than the present score
you have nothing but your own self respect riding on this game
its up to you
heres your swan song people
how are you gonna sing it
and with that he walks out
everybody looks beaten and depressed
shane stops two paramedics who push roland lamont on a stretcher
roland is really hurting
im sorry roland
that was a great block
for my last play in football ill take that block
shane looks terribly guilty
i thought you were going to score
did you slip
shane cant look at him but he nods
thats what i thought
you were a warrior roland
im gonna miss you
it was a dream come true
go kick some ass for me
the paramedics roll him away
shane slumps against the wall near tears
mcginty comes out of the locker room
he locks eyes with shane for a beat
and then mcginty turns his back on him and walks away
everyone is quiet
shane walks in
sid the equipment manager sees him and yells
hey shane i just heard
he smacks shane on his bad side and shane grimaces
congratulations on what
shane is staying on
hes gonna be martels backup
everyone stares at shane for a beat
is that true
nobody says anything for a beat
i got to tell you shane you played the first half like you were staying
like you already had a contract
shane looks around the room at this beaten bunch
no one makes eye contact with him
youre right clifford
and im sorry
but now i want to go out there and either beat these bastards or die trying
i never wanted to beat anybody so bad in my life
everybody lets this sink in
earl wilkinson finally speaks up
i dont know what yawl are doin tomorrow but my ass is goin back to jail
but if i gotta go i want to go back a winner
hell im retiring
i have thirty minutes of football left in my whole career
me too reese
lets get it on
everybody turns to shane
gentlemen our problem is the cowboys arent afraid of us
but they should be
weve got one chance on offense to make our stand the first play of the half
one touchdown aint gonna help shane
but one nasty ass play might
we just gotta be brave
and trust each other
shane happens to glance at pacifico
pacifico wont meet his eye
shane turns to sid
help me with this
sid helps shane strip his jersey off
everyone reacts to the bruises on shanes side
somebody has to tape me up
the cowboys are already back on the field as the redskins come out of their locker room
at nine forty eastern time the agreement was reached and except for this upcoming second half the strike is history
boomers tie is off and his shirt is torn
dan looks guilty but still angry
its about time
i say let the professionals back on the field
the fans deserve nothing less
yeah you would say that
the dallas kicker puts the ball in the end zone for a touchback
he starts to follow the offense out on the field
then he turns and sees annabelle engrossed in a cheer
he runs over to her
are you okay
is it your side
i owe you an apology
ill explain later
but thank you for believing in me
you give me strength just looking at you
and with that shane takes her in his arms and kisses her deeply
the crowd on that side of the field reacts to the kiss with a wooooooo
well this is a first
shane falco seems to be
hell al hes necking with a cheerleader
ive done a little of that in my time
the players are not supposed to fraternize with the cheerleaders
hey dan what are they gonna do
he breaks the kiss and looks up in the stands at eddie martel
shane gives him the finger
the crowd goes wooooo
at that too
martel doesnt think this is funny
shane walks onto the field leaving a confused but happy annabelle
he walks past dallas defensive lineman butler
that wasnt too smart
suck my dick
butler is too shocked for a comeback
it breaks and shane walks to the line of scrimmage
here we go first and ten for the redskins
twenty four zip dallas
we can see now that wilkinson and bateman are now part of the offense
they line up as receivers opposite defensive halfbacks
in fact everyone but shane is on the line of scrimmage paired up across from a cowboy
shane leans over reese and takes in the dallas defense
the dallas middle linebacker yells at shane
are you ready for more pain footsteps
shane just smiles
on the snap many things happen at once sticks his fingers inside butlers face mask and pokes both eyes
throws the ball as hard as he can at the middle linebacker and hits him in the crotch
the guy grabs himself and collapses
kicks his defender in the shins as hard as he can
the defender screams and falls down
gets a cornerback across from him in a choke hold
the guy cant breathe but bateman holds on
lifts up his defenders face guard and connects with a right hand to the guys chin
pulls the defensive lineman in front of him to the ground
then he falls on him
the guy screams
all across the line of scrimmage redskins are punching kicking and gouging the dallas defense
flags fly everywhere
most of the dallas players are down and screaming
jamal stands across from a defensive lineman
he hasnt touched the guy
but he nods to the player to look at his hand
the guy looks down just as jamal flicks open a deadly looking switchblade
the guy jumps back and yells hes got a knife
but there is so much confusion that nobody pays any attention
jamal slips the knife away
flags fly everywhere
ive never seen anything like this
one washington player had a cowboy in what appeared to be a police choke hold
i see at least five flags
the officials are going crazy trying to figure out the penalties as shane and the offense back up and make room for the dallas medical staff who come running out
on the field
some dallas players are livid to the ref he scratched my eyes out
he hit me on purpose
on mcginty hes smiling to himself on the sidelines
he faces the cameras turns on his microphone and sums up the penalties
unsportsmanlike conduct number number and number on the offense fifteen yards
to himself times three
thats forty five yards
illegal use of hands number on the offense fifteen yards
that makes it sixty yards
unnecessary roughness number and number fifteen yards
turns to another ref how many yards so far
a ref is taking a very long walk with it
he stops at the redskin two yard line and puts it down
shane leans in
okay everybody stick together and dont take any shit
lets make em hurt
they break the huddle and line up with their backs to their goal
butler is still whining
i cant believe you went for my eyes
im gonna do it again cause it was fun
he drops butler with a vicious forearm
shane flicks the ball over the middle to murray who pulls it in for fifteen yards and a first down
now at running back sweeps outside with jamal and reese evans leading the way
both linemen growl as they throw themselves into the defense
is rolling right with butler on his heels
just when it looks like butler has him cochran comes out of nowhere and cuts butler at the knees
shane fakes a throw and keeps the ball for a fifteen yard gain
hits franklin with a short flick pass
runs off tackle and scores
kicks the extra point
scoreboard dallas redskins
blitzes from his safety position and decks the dallas quarterback
stops a runner at the line of scrimmage and throws him for a loss
takes a punt at his own thirty
with bateman blocking wilkinson springs to the outside and goes all the way for a touchdown
pacifico kicks the extra point
scoreboard dallas redskins
is set to boot one
the ball is snapped the kicker moves forward and suddenly brian murray breaks through the offense and blocks the kick
hits franklin on a little down and out
hes hit by the defender the ball goes flying but so does a flag
redskin first down
four minutes six seconds remain
the redskin huddle breaks
the guys come to the line of scrimmage
first and ten at the cowboy twenty and im telling you we are looking at a totally different team here in the second half
the redskins are playing like theres no tomorrow because hey there isnt
i gotta agree with you on this one
the surprising thing for me is how ineffectual the cowboys have been in this half
i mean they look totally intimidated
i love when you guys agree
hes in the shotgun calling signals
he gets the snap and starts looking downfield for receivers
he slips while hes blocking butler who takes advantage of the situation and blows by him
hes got franklin crossing in the end zone
he cocks and throws and simultaneously gets decked by butler
a dallas defensive halfback goes up for it but just tips the ball
it keeps going now end over end
right into the waiting arms of franklin who is standing by himself in the end zone
franklin is shocked
his teammates run into frame and mob him
what a fluke
total luck there al
makes up for the perfect ones they drop
maybe not so lucky
falco is down
hes on his back
she looks worried as trainers run out onto the field
theyre watching in oneils bedroom
trainers are bending over him
hes out but hes mumbling put your tits on my head
a trainer hears that and looks worried
shanes teammates run up and carry him off the field
hes holding for pacifico on the extra point
on the snap franklin bobbles the ball but manages to put it down
pacifico belts it through the uprights
scoreboard dallas washington
shane is sitting on the bench holding his head and his side
hes talking quietly to mcginty
hes on the field calling for a fair catch
he makes it
one minute twenty remaining and even though dallas didnt score they sure ate up a lot of the clock
hes leading the offense out onto the field
and it looks like falco cannot answer the bell
hes still on the bench and it appears that safety earl wilkinson will be leading the redskin offense
they just need to get the ball in field goal range
and for pacifico thats anything up to sixty five yards
he takes the snap from the shotgun and keeps the ball on a sweep
he plows for twelve yards
thats good for twelve yards
the clock stops on the first down
the redskins have no time outs left
mcginty is still bent over him
mcginty i need your hands in there for the field goal
i cant trust franklin to hold
he almost dropped the extra point
shane is in major pain but nods his head
i can do it
he rolls again but no one is open
he crosses the line of scrimmage is hit and goes down
it continues to run and passes twenty seconds as we watch
theyre hurrying back to the line of scrimmage
wilkinson stands over center
on the snap wilkinson throws the ball out of bounds
wilkinson throws it away and with twelve seconds remaining the redskins will try a forty eight yard field goal to tie it up
thats almost a chip shot for pacifico
he shakily follows pacifico out onto the field
reese evans catches up with him
to shane are you okay
just make it a good snap
to pacifico and youll do the rest right
pacifico doesnt answer
evans leans over it
hes kneeling in the middle of the field waiting for the snap
but something is bothering him
to pacifico lou are you alright
pacifico looks up from where he is set up for the kick
there are tears in his eyes
they know where my family lives
shane tries to digest what he just heard
through his legs come on shane
shane looks back at pacifico and makes a decision
the ball is snapped perfectly
shane catches it and spots it perfectly
pacifico moves to kick it
and shane pulls the ball away
pacifico flies through the air like snoopy as he kicks nothing but air
he lands hard
shane jumps to his feet and starts running
its a fake
falco has it
on mcginty hes in shock
he has totally caught the cowboys by surprise
he sweeps around the right side
the dallas middle linebacker has recovered and is moving quickly to cut shane off
but reese evans comes out of nowhere and crushes the guy with a flying block
shane cuts downfield and heads for the end zone with nobody near him except for the same safety from the first half who waits for him at the ten
the safety smiles as he takes a bead on shane
shane heads right for the guy
he puts his head down and smacks helmets with the safety
the guy goes down and shane runs over him and into the end zone
on mcginty he jumps into the air
he jumps out of bed
they jump on each other
shes jumping for joy
he spikes the shit out of the ball
and then sees something up field
wait a minute
wait a minute
weve got a flag down
shane stands stock still in the end zone watching the ref call the penalty
hes wearing number and he collapses in tears
they are now sobbing in agony
hes being helped back to bed by augustine
hes walking slowly back to the line of scrimmage
on mcginty he looks sick
shane walks up to pacifico who is down
his arm is being immobilized by a team trainer
i broke my arm
big smile thank you
you saved my ass
in his earpiece he hears mcginty
someday you can explain what that was all about
we got no kicker so you gotta take it in
youre the leader
to himself what would unitas do in this situation
pause i have no idea
shane leans into the huddle
im so sorry shane
im sorry everybody
no problem mickey
to evans hell of a hit reese
thats the one i was looking for
i can retire in peace now
right after this play
so besides me who really wants the ball
he looks around the huddle
he studies each face
and then he comes to rest on brian murray
brians eyes are shining
he doesnt need words here
to murray yeah
you want it brian
lets hook up
signs as he says it blue left slot open a right
two jet x drive
gentlemen its been an honor sharing the field of battle
everybody puts their hands into the middle
they break the huddle with a roar
three seconds are showing
shane leans over reese and calls it
on the snap shane rolls left
he cuts his man at the knees
he takes two men down
he cuts on a deep post
he steps up and throws a clean bullet downfield
he roars in pain as he throws it
the pass is perfect
he pulls it in and beats his man to the end zone
hail to the redskins is deafening
todd rod and bob are screaming
oneil kisses augustine
annabelle throws a punch into the air
mcginty is all smiles
shane walks up to him and they shake hands
pilachowski and banes hug
lee and andre are hugging and crying
cochran is on his knees praying
reese evans joins him
wilkinson hugs jamal
clifford franklin hometown boy throws himself into the stands where fans mob him
the washington redskins first string quarterback is so pissed off he jumps up from his seat and turns quickly to go up the steps and out of the stadium
but he slips awkwardly and falls
he grabs his knee and screams
hes still in the end zone holding the ball up to the crowd
the roar is deafening
we hear nothing but somehow the pure energy of the moment comes through
in the silence hes walking in slow motion toward annabelle
and everybody is smiling
