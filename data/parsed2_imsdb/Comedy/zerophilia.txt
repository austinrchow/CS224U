written by martin curland revised march
an engine rumbles in the distance
the full moon shimmers on a puddle
a frog splats in splashing a one man pup tent
lukes eyes pop open disoriented realizing hes fallen asleep reading by flashlight
hes nineteen still slightly awkward and unaware hes growing handsome
he listens as the engine rumbles louder closer
he peers out through the tent flap
glaring head lamps roar toward him
scrambling out of his sleeping bag he hurls himself against the side of the tent as
an rv camper nearly plows down the tent skidding to a stop in the mud
luke extricates himself from the tent
he runs to the driver side window of the rv
are you all right
inside alexa thirties earthy looks up at him bleary eyed
she nods yes
how did you even get here
theres no road
im from utah
are you alone out here
he nods yes
she bursts into tears
ive been driving for days
i dont even know where im going
im really sorry
she gathers herself sniffling
i have warm apple kringel in the camper
would you like some
uh what is it
luke stands at the rvs tiny kitchen counter wolfing pastry off a paper plate
so this survival quest is your vacation
its my third try
kind a lame huh
seven days alone in the wilderness
id be afraid
its just something i really wanted to do
luke notices an odd pile of stuff by the sink
the electric drill
she smiles grateful eyeing his torn t shirt and shorts
youre all wet and muddy
why dont i hang those up to dry
im propositioning you
he considers fearful but thrilled
students crisscross on bikes in front of the quadrangle
the huge round headlights and muscular front grill of an old semi truck rumbles up to the curb
its the cab only like the sliced off front of a train engine
luke hops down startling his friends keenan and janine passionately making out on the sidewalk
twenty brainy and athletic janine adjusts her glasses the only remnant of a bookish past as she thoughtfully considers lukes massive truck
sort of retro
i thought you were gettin a pickup
i changed my mind
hoping for a more enthusiastic response he turns to keenan who climbs up and peeks inside the cab
hes rugged streetwise perpetually bemused maybe ed norton and bill murray had a son
you think its stupid
janine stares at him
she shrugs trying to put her finger on it and when luke rolls up his t shirt sleeves she grins
oh my god
you got laid
who is she
luke glares at keenan
i didnt say a word
you know janine
shes got x ray vision
to janine camping
a total stranger
i knew that whole waitin to meet the right girl thing was crap
i have to get to physics
the trucks great
see ya hottie
could find something to call me other than what every guy in the world would say
at a loss keenan grabs her and kisses her passionately
she walks off rolling her eyes but secretly loves it
keenan climbs up into the cab
so this is gonna be like your car
look i know its dopey
but dont you recognize it
its painted and the mufflers switched out but this was my dads
keenan looks around with fresh eyes
he reaches an arm way up under the glove box and grins pulling out a small stash of weed
a little dried out
the truck barrels along through the trees
luke and keenan share a joint
first off that woman
we didnt go all the way you know
you think technically im still a virgin
were you inside her
i been havin this weird dream
the thing is i think maybe the dreams real
no way im tellin you
you know enough of my secrets to get me shot
sharons mom on thanksgiving
what the fuck dream is there you cant tell me
its about part of me gettin smaller
an important part
keenan looks over warily then busts out laughing then realizes lukes serious
you have gotta be fuckin kiddin me
youre not thirteen
maybe i caught something
i think its good you bought this truck
they both laugh
a small run down service garage crammed with tires tools and discarded car parts
lukes truck idles in the service bay billowing smoke
max nineteen lean in overalls with shoulder length hair and edgy eyes wipes his greasy hands on a rag
dripping with masculinity he swaggers around the truck chewing gum wielding a pneumatic torque wrench which he occasionally revs for emphasis
i can do the gasket for twenty bucks
but new t sprocks for this thing
two three hundred maybe
can i hold off on that
no skin off my ass
but a few days weeks your whole transmission could blow
i shouldnt got this
max considers sets his baseball cap on the truck fender and four hundred seventy five horsepower
twenty eight inch wheels
its a classic
let me dig around out back
maybe we got a used set
thatd be great
max disappears through a squeaky door at the back
luke picks up a rag and wipes fingerprints off the fender
he sits impatient for max to return
he examines maxs cap tries it on
he picks up the torque wrench swaggers about trying to look macho in the manner of max
he spins around and revs the wrench catching sight of michelle twenty watching him from out front in jeans and t shirt with warm confident eyes
luke swallows wide eyed a deer in headlights
he sets down the torque wrench
its not my wrench
its my truck
whats wrong with it
oh just needs a new gasket and a couple t sprocks
the flanges are sheared off
no big deal
you have to watch my brother max
hes sellin you t sprocks
theres no such thing
last week he sold mrs
gustafson a whole set six hundred bucks
my names michelle
from new york
poli sci transfer
i sort of asked around campus
youve probly already got a stalker huh
luke stares awkward
you heard about cafe lunizia
they got new york style pizza
make you feel at home
you askin me out
oh well uh definitely
an suv pulls up at the gas pump stuffed with keenan and other guys
chad exuding supreme self confidence calls over to luke as he pumps gas
hey spanky lets go
look forward to kickin your puck ass
your names spanky
no puck ass but people just call me luke
were beatin his frat boy team in street hockey
pisses em off
ill talk to max
tell him to just replace the gasket
lukes breathing grows heavier
so what do you think
ill just sit there while you eat
i wont even talk
look i just split up with this total amoeba
oh im a paramecium
thats way more evolved
im practically pond scum
maybe ill give you a call when the trucks ready
you mean to go out right
michelle smiles and walks out through the squeaky door at the back
a whisper whoa
that was her
jesus youre sweatin like crazy
luke sits nods yes wipes beads of sweat from his brow
were goin out
keenan gives him a high five
luke smiles catching his breath
a small run down house
hockey gear dirty laundry and keenan are strewn across the garage sale sofa
he munches a burrito while watching the game
keenan leaps up
he races down the hall sliding on the linoleum
luke a towel around his waist stares at himself in the mirror horrified
keenan looks clueless a little uncomfortable now
i had hair
not a lot but youve seen me some right
okay i dont know
well whered it go
keenan takes a bite of the burrito in his hand now mashed
i really thought you gettin laid was gonna help
what is it with you man
i mean youre smarter than me youre better lookin than me
i am not
but im just sayin you can get any girl you want
easy for you youve got janine
im still workin on my ged
how long you think brainiacs gonna wanna hang with that
she worships you
man im gonna be that wild fling she had with the local dude from the bike shop
god what was his name
keenan gives him a look of im crazy
youre gonna have a great time with her tonight
just be yourself
luke and michelle dine on the patio strung with far too many white lights
i caught him with my best friend
such a cliche
from this park avenue family
hed know what kind of mushrooms those are what the best wine is
the best wine is beer
im such a moron
no i am
i have incontrovertible proof
she kicks off her shoe and sticks her bare foot on the table a tattoo of a green bird on her ankle
its a hawk
see youre smirking
and its green
thats the one color tattoo they cant remove
im considering a prosthetic foot
they sip from their glasses and drink each other in
luke contemplates a kiss
but his breathing grows shallow he gasps
whats the matter
maybe just kind a hot out here
you want moron
when my dad died its okay i was nine
i barely knew what was goin on but i thought the tombstone was really sad looking so i painted smiley faces and fish all over it
yeah im sure dad wouldve loved that
his face reddens
overheated luke tugs at his shirt brushes sweat from his brow
so what do you think makes a good relationship
i dont know
knowing you want to be there even when it gets scary or bloody
whered that come from
no its just not the usual guy thing
youre great you know
luke puts his hand on his chest feels something
he stands puts on his jacket
will you excuse me a sec
hyper ventilating his arms clutching his chest beads of sweat on his forehead luke checks the mens room door locked
he ducks out the service entrance
by the dumpster luke reaches behind his head whips off his jacket and shirt and looks down
his eyes go wide
on his chest female breasts
two waiters come outside for a smoke
table twenty nine
like to bring her the cannoli special
luke peers over the dumpster down at his breasts with a high fever and passes out slumping to the ground
lukes eyes open dilated disoriented
hes lying on the ground shirtless among bits of garbage
he watches bleary eyed as a mouse peers at him from inside an empty milk carton
the mouse runs over and sniffs at a canteloupe which triggers lukes memory he grabs his chest relieved to find its back to normal
he stands dizzy surveying the dark locked restaurant and staggers across the deserted parking lot toward his truck
lukes semi thunders along
luke stares out in shock
he hears heavy breathing moans voices
he looks around for the source of the sounds glances over
in its reflection a leering male stripped to the waist
lie down for me baby
the head lamps of an oncoming car flash at him
as he glances out the driver side window music blares from the passing car
a glimpse of what might be an orgy of bodies intertwined
the female driver grins maniacally up at luke as the car horn screams by
luke careens to one side glancing at the trucks
the car recedes in the distance but the female driver appears close in the mirrors reflection leering
she licks the mirror from the inside and disappears
luke stares out eyes glazed
the decrepit old garage looks as if it may collapse any second
barbells on the floor
luke dodges and weaves slugging a makeshift punching bag
keenan appears wiping sleep from his eyes
we takin up boxing
i dont know
whats goin on
you competin for mr
universe this week
everyone should just mind their own fucking business
keenan recoils at the attitude
didnt go so great huh
luke punches the bag harder and faster a near seizure road he collapses in a heap
it was goin great
and really smart
and the way she eats ravioli like aah
then i started feelin all weird again and
oh man youll think im nuts
keen i had breasts
i felt em
whoa first date
definitely the new luke
youre startin to creep me out
listen i think i know whats goin on okay
acute adolescent anxiety
its from the stress of college girls grades
its really common
im not an adolescent
whered you get this crap
i found all the symptoms right off panic attacks localized alopecia thats hair loss
this doctor wrote back any chance your friend luke just lost his virginity
you told you gave him my name
hes a doctor back east
hes sending this information pack
look i started thinkin youre goin bipolar on me or somethin
come on man breasts
luke hops down from the truck cab fixes his shirt and hair trying to look nonchalant as he rings the doorbell
hearing something behind him he turns as max punches him in the stomach knocking the wind out of him
you son of a bitch stay the hell away from my sister
luke gasps for air
you dont say a word
you just leave her sittin there
i came to apologize
max shoves him across the yard
get out a here
shes not home anyway
will you tell her i came by
shes honest with you so you bolt
and then what you wake up feelin sorry for her
is that what she thinks
i left cause a what she said
shes like the most incredible girl i ever met
max sneers skeptical
i had this pasta quattro funghi four mushroom
it took me a while to even figure it out but i think someone put shrooms in it or somehow they got in there by mistake
i was hallucinating and everything
amazes even me a guys capacity to be a world class asshole
fortunately im familiar with the cause
will you please just tell her i came by
ill catch up with her on my own
look im gonna see her again if shell see me
i dont care what the fuck you say about it
they face off
you get near her ill feed your nuts to the neighbors dog
what kind a dog is it
i mean is it a pitbull or what
caught off guard a smile escapes max
im crazy about her
luke nods yes
ill tell her you came by
luke nods appreciative
a tanker truck quakes past
surrounded by fir trees the eerily empty mini mart glows with fluorescent junk food
luke stands behind the cash register leafing through the outdoors man
the chime bings and sydney enters early thirties elegant in thrift store chic
shes cool and in control
at least on the outside
she surveys random candy bars stealing glances at luke
had a sudden intense craving for a cherry popsicle
you can check in that freezer
what a relief
workin late huh
yeah four am
sometimes you guys are just unfathomably stupid
why in the world do guys say it sucks as if it were a bad thing
i mean every guys dying to get a blow job right
so you think theyd treat those words with profound respect like holy scripture
what an unbelievable sunset honey doesnt it just suck
you won an olympic gold medal
i guess youre right
it must be great at your age
that river of testosterone coursing through your veins the damn about to burst
how about we just lock this place up and go for an olympic gold
disappointed she checks her reflection in the freezer door
i ought to dye my hair
dont you think
uh i dont know
your hair is such an incredible color
i love it
do you think i could cut just a little piece
match the color
it really sucks
youre messin with me
i love it
you really should get rid a that thing anyway
i have clippers in my bag
i can just snip it off
she snips his hair
luke pulls away
whats the matter
dont you like being touched
dont you like being a guy
sorry but youre just bizarre
she chuckles lays money on the counter
but i learned long ago you cant change your true nature even if it can change you
as she leaves she takes a provocative bite of the popsicle
acres of yellowing corn surround a dilapidated farmhouse converted into a pool hall
the windows glow from warm lights inside
parked along the gravel driveway are pickup trucks cars and lukes semi
smoke rowdy music and the clack of cue balls
keenan and luke snake their way through the pool tables
its that lady from the store
grey and black at the bar
keenan looks over at sydney finishing off a bourbon
janine and michelle check out a rack of billiard balls from the worldly british owner polly
she runs the place like a wild west saloon with such ease and confidence it suggests there may be a shotgun under the bar
that boy keenan still giving you trouble
actually i tried exactly what you said
works every time
to michelle nice to meet you darling
i hope youll find not too many rules here and the drinks not too dear
polly moves off
isnt she great
guys drive across the state just to buy a beer from her
total loner though
no ones ever seen her with anyone
what did she tell you to try
janine whispers in her ear
michelles jaw drops open scandalized
luke hands his keys to jeremy the handsome bartender in exchange for a full pitcher of beer
shes eyeing you
i think shes comin over
sydney saunters up
can i buy you a drink
uh no thanks
were already here with dates and stuff
where is she
theyre around somehwere
luke if you like this girl we better talk
sydney glances around talks quietly
anything happen since we last spoke
pressure in your chest
who are you
you know him
we exchanged e mail
i came right away
luke gives keenan the evil eye
your friend here has an extra chromosome
the little remaining color in lukes face now drains away
he shakes his head no
someone put mushrooms in my mushroom sauce
i tested your hair
youre like some whack job
get the hell away from me
luke moves off sloshing beer
denial denial denial
always the first step
keep him away from that girl
whatre you talkin about
most people have forty six two x if youre a girl an x and y if youre a guy
hes got forty seven an x a y and a janine and michelle select pool cues
weve only been together six months
and hes such a guys guy everyones buddy but alcoholic parents six months in juvey
wild past huh
i think the only reason hes even alive right now is okay partly cause hes so damn smart but mostly cause theres this one person he knows absolutely no matter
what wont bale on him
he doesnt trust me at all
hes a rock
so yes you can trust him
im hoping keenans the same way
cause believe me im not used to rocks im used to pebbles
grains of sand
luke rejoins them with the pitcher of beer glancing back toward the bar
keenan comes too with a look of concern
i need a drink
keenan steals glances at luke trying to sort it all out
aside to luke that ladys nuts
sydney sits at a bar stool keeping an eye on luke and michelle
jeremy lays out a cocktail napkin speaks with a slight texas drawl
you see that couple over there
i dont get it
whats he see in her
id give my left one to be with her
so could he
now alone with michelle luke lines up his cue stick then catches michelles admiring eyes
she smiles glances over at keenan and janine making out by the jukebox
your friends sorta like each other huh
thirty seconds together you cant pull em apart
howd they meet
keenan sold her a bike
i dont think theyve been apart more than six hours since
luke peers over the corner pocket and watches michelle shoot and sink the ball
i never thought in a million years youd go out with me let alone twice
youre not sposed to say that
thats a total pathetic loser thing to say
but im gonna take it as a huge compliment
okay two word answers only
whyd you ask me out in the first place
whyd you say yes
luke sneers not his favorite compliment
okay two words
whatre you most passionate about
so much for deep
the electricity between them charges the air
luke maneuvers himself closer
okay im gonna take a wild shot
ricochet off the back over here then straight into that side pocket
what are my chances
point zero zero zero one
luke takes his shot
and kisses her
the ball ricochets off the back across the table and sinks in the pocket at the side
jeremy looks on aroused
sydney squints dismayed barely able to watch
will you look at that tonsil hockey
id prefer not
this could get bad
youve been staring at him all night
you got a thing for him or what
actually im hoping hes got one for me
keenan and janine rejoin luke and michelle all four elated
looks like you two are gettin on okay
should we rack up another game
id like to get good at this pool thing
luke racks up the balls as michelle lines up the cue
okay im gonna break this wide open
go for it
before keenan has lifted the wooden triangle rack michelle hammers the cue ball
it cracks off the rack rockets off the table
and cannonballs luke in the crotch
keenan michelle and janine all gasp
they cringe poised waiting for luke to react
luke picks the cue ball up off the floor and sets it on the table
he sees them watching him
man id be on the floor cryin like a baby
no im all right
surprised they return to the game
michelle lines up the cue ball again as luke considers
with a slow dawning realization that something somehow just isnt right
he casually touches his hand to his pants
he pales slightly
would you excuse me a sec
he looks to keenan for help
sydney watches as keenan and luke cross the hall toward the back
she flags jeremy
a glance at luke better give me the whole bottle
luke tries the mens room door locked
keenan opens another door that leads them into a store room
luke follows with a look of concern
i mean it was like a precision guided missile
luke unzips and gently digs in his trousers
he looks down shudders
uh ah lukes face contorts terrified
ill get some ice
luke shakes his head no points toward his crotch gasps barely able to make a sound
keenan gives him a look repelled perplexed
then takes a look
his eyes get huge
sydney bursts in with the bottle of bourbon
i was afraid a this
to keenan make sure no one gets in
to luke now will you listen to me
luke slack jawed keeps checking himself
each time the horror of it grows more intense
sydney uncaps the bourbon and drops capsules in from a prescription bottle
its gonna come back
whatre you givin me
and a shitload of darvon
you gotta calm down
here we go
he and sydney have to yell to hear over lukes escalating whats wrong with him
hes a zerophiliac
im gettin a doctor
this isnt right
sydney grabs keenan shoves him against the wall
i am a doctor
you breathe one word anyone else sees him like this and hes fucked
pictures all over the net tabloids television
were gonna get it back
to keenan you let me help him he gets a normal body lives a normal life
now you his friend or not
keenan nods that yes he is
sydney releases him
hang onto him
so he doesnt get hurt when he passes out
now just wait a sec
is it there are no recorded incidents of transmission from physical contact
oh please god
what did i do nothing
youre a z
oh my god i used his deodorant
oh will you calm down
lukes eyes glaze over
he weaves losing his balance
sydney helps luke flop down on the floor
he passes out
hell be alright
he didnt go all the way
when you fall asleep or pass out a z almost always reverts back
its called a nocturnal remission
keenan approaches luke then steps back
oh relax its not contagious
keenan grabs the bourbon darvon concoction from sydney wipes the rim of the bottle just in case then takes a big swig
on a corner table sits high tech laboratory equipment
keenan and luke gulp beers still in shock
luke keeps one hand down his pants for reassurance
in the world
theres no way to know
it doesnt show up in any normal dna test
its triggered when you first have sex
the woman in the rv
dark from utah
now youre morphescent whenever youre aroused
you tellin me this is gonna happen any time he gets the hots for a girl
keenan looks over at luke
man this could be a problem
is there a cure
its not a disease
but there are steps you can take
well what are they
take it easy
you cant rush this
before anything you need to try going all the way
all the way
you need to turn all the way into a female
you out of your mind
you have to give it a try
maybe we should get a second opinion
yeah may be
cause you can fine but i warn you theyve never seen this before
first theyll try a barrage of antipsychotic medications surgery electroshock therapy god knows what
if he were to try goin all the way then what
luke glares at him
im just askin
it aint gonna happen
oh for chris sake
im trying to help you
that z chromosomes not latent anymore
you dont get control a that thing you dont know when its going to kick in what its gonna do
you want to end up with three left breasts behemoth hips and one testicle
luke and keenan swallow wide eyed at the prospect
sydney calms herself down
now theres no reason for that to happen
youre not the only one who didnt get any sleep
now are you going to let me help or not
how would he even do that
go all the way i mean
hes a z
to luke you become morphescent when you get turned on
you can change all the way when you have an orgasm
well excuse me
truth is at this stage you dont really need anyone else
sydney wearily sips a highball
she looks to keenan for help
keenan flashes the international sign for jacking off
its a lot to absorb i know
when youre ready give me a call
your first time you shouldnt be alone
a deserted hilltop cemetery
luke sits on the manicured lawn across from a gravestone with vestigial images of brightly colored smiley faces and fish
and i really like her dad
he bounces a soccer ball against the headstone
you know i always thought your dying was the worst thing that ever happened to me and that happened more to you than it did to me
i mean a lot more really
luke paces nervously
look every day i wish you were around but i swear if i tell you this you damn well better stay dead
he glances at a burial ceremony half mile away
and i swear to god im gonna beat this thing
no matter what it takes
before i tell you i just want to make sure you know that okay
a hushed voice
i think i might be a zerophiliac
keenan and luke spar on roller blades hockey sticks in hand
luke whacks the hockey puck with such intensity it may land on mars
im not doin it
i dont care what she says
i can control this thing
i didnt know what was goin on before
i do now so its not gonna be a problem
i just need to stay focused
you mean keep yourself from getting turned on
howre you gonna do that
you get turned on by two scoops of ice cream
luke glares at him
im just sayin
i mean you think larissa the horse faced girls got her good points
michelle and janine ride up on their bikes
i knew wed find em here
we just wanted to know if youre alright
after last night
slightly suggestive good
luke smiles his face reddens
i had a really good
luke smiles nods followed by a look of panic
will you excuse me a sec
he ducks away
what is goin on
we just need to be alone
we got a big game tomorrow
sometimes guys just need to hang with the guys you know
janine gives him a look of what the hell are you talkin about
keenan stares back pleading
janine relents despite herself
let the boys play with their pucks
luke leans against the logs wipes sweat from his brow and realizes
panicked he grabs his crotch feels it everythings normal
or is it
he frantically unbuttons his shirt and peers inside
he slumps back against the logs
luke storms through the house trying to evade janine who enthusiastically follows
keenan traipses after
you told her
i had to
you know janine
she knew somethin was up
ive read about this kinda thing but i didnt think it was real
its so cool
how can you say that
if i had a chance to be a guy for a day id jump at it
seriously keen wouldnt you want to get inside a girls body
realizing she just handed him the perfect straight line
dont even go there
rolling her eyes fine
still isnt it every guys dream to have a pair of boobs to play with anytime he wants
not my own
to keenan man how could you tell her
she should be here
its just weird two guys alone one turnin into a girl
yeah i cant wait
not exactly something you get to see every day
what he gets to and i dont
no one gets to
luke goes in the bedroom slams the door
keenan and janine take up residence outside
janine tries to peek through the keyhole beneath the door
should we put on some soft music
you want a magazine in there
janine keeps an ear held close against the door
how bout a couple beers
maybe you want to take a bath
will you please shut up
does he sound different
lewd oh my god
rising in pitch oh my gawd
keenan and janine exchange a worried look
now approaching the mirror in awe
gently raising a hand to touch the exquisite female face reflected there stands a real female an absolutely female luke
the door opens revealing female luke wrapped in a sheet
keenan clutches janine
they stare at a total loss incredulous
female luke speaks with an unmistakably female voice
happened fast huh
can we see
female luke hesitates
its not like i havent seen you naked a hundred times
and shes a girl
female luke shyly parts the sheet revealing her stunning naked torso
exasperated of course theyre perfect
i couldnt have tits like that
female luke checks herself out in the mirror
look at me
keenan and janine sit on the edge of the bed in shock
whats the matter
keenan afraid to answer looks to janine
they both have the same reaction
youre really hot
victorias secret hot
sports illustrated swimsuit edition
latvian lesbians hidden camera chronicles
to keenan dont look at me its your tape
keenan keeps his distance from luke embarrassed if turned on
look i just wanna get one thing straight
no way im gonna sleep with you
man even as a joke thats just i will
im definitely not into the butch hair thing though
you gotta do something about that
keenan looks at her shocked
i thought youre into watchin two girls
female luke cant stop gazing at herself in the mirror
this is too weird
this is freaking me out
should we call dr
i did it
now i can switch back
get outta here
yeah okay yeah
will you stop starin
janine rolls her eyes as she and keenan back out of the room their eyes locked on her amazing body
janine and keenan are sprawled on the nearby couch
luca opens the door
its like i cant get in the right mood or something
welcome to my world
oh honey no one could in this situation
you gotta help
i need to do this right now
you cant force these things
some girls go half their lives before they even have one
okay studly what do you suggest
she likes it when i tell her stuff
youre so beautiful i love your smile the english patient was my favorite movie too
janine and female luke both roll their eyes
female luke swings the door shut
the doorbell chimes
figured youll want some after
janine throws it open max stands outside
can i help you
i was lookin for luke
hes not around right now
female luke comes out of the bedroom wrapped in a sheet
she stops in her tracks stares at max
max stares back intrigued
how ya doin
female luke nods okay
you live here too
janine keenan and female luke are momentarily speechless
shes just visiting
shes lukes cousin
keenan and luca glare at janine
max gazes at luca spellbound
i always thought luca was a guys name
italian or something
luca wraps herself more tightly in the sheet
im part italian
im part italian too
the important part
perfect italian lei sono una bella donna
amerei per mostrarlo il che inclinando torre di pisa
whats that mean
his eyes fixed on luca he smiles
you in town for a while
no just a few weeks
im leaving today
is there anything you want me to tell luke
max gets fluid scanning the room for a toehold infatuated by luca
he seizes on a hockey stick
im way into hockey
i was hopin luke could show me the ropes
is he as awesome as ive heard
do you play
uh i dont know
shes gotta pack
you need to go
really nice meeting you
janine ushers max out the door and shuts it on him
luca ducks into the bedroom shuts the door
luca at the window peers out between the curtains watching as max walks away
as max gets to the end of the driveway he stops and turns back sporting a charming smile
luca jumps away from the window smacking into janine
are you okay
luca just stares back at her nonplussed
what is it
whats the matter
beginning to get it oh
what do you mean oh
shrugs hes a hunk
i got to switch back
whats the big deal
get out of here
just get out
janine emerges from the bedroom to join keenan
he looks up at her questioning
whats goin on
its a girl thing
does he need any help in there
not from you
keenan and janine sprawled out leaning against the door half eaten pizza between them on the floor weary
buzzing emanates from inside the bedroom
this is good
keenan and janine perk up
alright okay now open those little levers on the sides
and flip that center thingy back
keenan finds this particularly unsettling
enthused did you get this thing at the mall
janine wouldnt have one a those
and mines got way more features than that one
keenans crotch or that one
keenan gives her the evil eye
so whered you get it
it was larissas
inside the bedroom the buzzing stops
keenan grabs the last bottle from his six pack
im just sayin hes not that experienced with girls
oh and you are
im startin to wonder if you are
im not gonna feed your fantasies
keenan flips the tv remote disturbed
luca sits on the edge of the bed frustrated
dont call me that
you gotta just think about whatever turns you on
no matter what it is
luca considers she goes over to the window peers out momentarily then draws back
janine lies down on the floor
last ditch okay pretend youre thrown on your back pinned against the bed
spread eagle eyes closed she fantasizes as she directs
you cant move an arm a leg nothing even an inch
keenan glances over taken aback at her tone
and two strong hands feel your thighs
keenan watches getting turned on
creeping firmly slowly toward your breasts
keenan lunges for janine
babe every time i look at you i get the shivers
i just want to rip your clothes off and throw you down
theyre kissing rolling around together now
i want to envelop every inch of you that incredible curve along your side
they roll on the floor clothes torn
i want to pin your arms over your head and make mad passionate
keenan and janine recoil
whether agony or ecstasy its a frightening sound
the door opens
luke stands in his shorts all male
youre a screamer
sydney makes her way through a barbed wire fence past a no trespassing sign
a lone dog howls in the distance
life size replicas of greek gods venus and david all face one way in the mist
their cold stone bodies press up against each other nude indifferent
a figure peers out between the statues in a long black coat a baseball cap over his eyes luke
what are we doing here
didnt want anyone around
so i did what you said
was it difficult making the switch
it was hard gettin back
i need an owners manual
sydney smiles nods in agreement
a lot of guys could use one of those
so what now
do i take pills or something
no it doesnt work like that
this may sound odd but i need to know if youre attracted to me
youre not gay are you
im just not attracted to you like that
okay calm down
this could be a problem
right now you can go either way anytime you want
its a very special and critical time for a z something youll experience only once in life
you need to use this incredible opportunity youve been given to figure out which youre supposed to be male or female
dont you see
you get to choose
i dont want to choose
i want to be a guy
yes well the thing is sometimes your desires can conflict with your desires
its important to know for sure
believe me i know
i think you need to try again
whyre you so resistant
if the truth is you want to be a guy great but if not
dont even say that
well clearly some part of you feels differently
you couldnt change if you didnt want to
thats the thing about the truth
itll set you free but first it can really piss you off
sydney moves to leave
this is nuts
im supposed to be a guy
then whats the problem
you are one
sydney turns to leave
youre not gonna help
i will the moment youre ready to try again
you can come back to my place right now if you want
bikes and suvs outside the shut down mill
abandoned timber surrounds an asphalt clearing
luke keenan chad jeremy and other guys in the midst of a friendly if brutal roller hockey game
luke glances over and spots max high up on a pile of logs cheering them on
jeremy passes the puck off to luke who drives it maniacally to score the winning goal
the guys cheer
well aint we a basket a biscuits
yeah luke what got into you today
the guys gather up their belongings near the cars
luke sits on the running board of his truck unlacing his skates
max comes over
i dropped by your place
any chance you could give me a few pointers
youre awesome out there
and according to my sister you walk on water
luke grunts a smile
truth is i uh met your cousin
you both have practically the same name
we were both named after our uncle
well shes cool
actually shes hot
i was hopin maybe you could hook me up
not a chance
she just wouldnt be interested
she a lesbian
of course not
shes my cousin
michelles my sister
you gonna tell me you wouldnt like to do her
fuck you man
luke shoves max who shoves him right back
what is your deal
luke lunges for him
they go at it wrestling fiercely
max gets the upper hand and pins luke down to the ground
luke surges with rage breaks free
grit teeth ripped clothes they roll on top of each other two rabid pitbulls
keenan and the other guys rush in pulling them apart
keep the fuck away from me
and michelle too
you can fuck off
what the hells goin on
to the guys lukes datin his sister
oh you can all fuck off
luke breaks free of the guys and moves off
sydney stands at the bar with a cup of coffee chatting with jeremy
ive had it for years
well its very sexy
i love mens clothes
what else have you got in your closet
jeremy smiles unsure what she means
when polly approaches her eyes a little red jeremy pulls her aside
polly are you alright
didnt mean to walk in on you
im fine thanks
thats the trade off
she puts a hand to his cheek reassuring
jeremy ducks behind the bar
my god hes gorgeous
yes hes a michelangelo
and the sweetest boy in the world
sorry darling im afraid youll find hes not your type
oh well see about that
i think he may prefer men
i certainly hope so
keenan and janine enter
you two better have a seat
is luke alright
he should have full control over this now
something must be really confusing him
the only thing i can think of
when he became luca was he attracted to one of you
you can get really thrown by that
well he sure as hell wasnt attracted to me
wasnt it just the two of you
janine glances to keenan as his eyes go wide grossed out
oh give me a break
they just had a huge fight
he tried to beat the crap out of him
janine and sydney exchange a knowing look
oh christ lukes not queer
he was just turnin into a girl
he was a girl
this is just wrong
would you rather she was attracted to me
maybe i would
right now luke needs your help
he needs to know youre behind him no matter what he wants
so whats all this mean
maybe luca really likes this boy enough to want to be female
to keenan dont sneer
oh come on
i know the guy
weve done all kinds a shit together hoops hockey
oh and girls cant play sports
why the hell would he want to be a girl
thats so hard to imagine
i know what im talking about
you see this
sydney pulls out a snapshot shows it to janine
oh my god
youre one too
youre a z
youre a guy
i made a terrible mistake
she and keenan keep staring at the photo
and once you finally figure out who you are its a horrible thing not being yourself
thats why its crucial we help luke
janine nods grasping the significance
keenan keeps looking from the photo to sydney and back again
you musta worked out
luke sits waiting on the steps of a campus dormitory
janine approaches grinning carrying a box tied with a bow
keenan trails behind straddling his bike
whats this all about
janine hands him the box
keenan sneers cringes
its just a little something we thought you might want
luke opens it pulls out a blue dress
what the hell is this for
elated i told her
to janine i told ya
what a stupid ass idea
we just want you to know whatever you decide its all right with us
no its not
get this thing away from me
judas luke hurls the box out to the curb
keenan gives him a thumbs up
think she wishes everyone was female
whats that sposed to mean
oh christ janine
it means he doesnt want to be girl
like hed have to think about that
there happen to be millions of us out there that like being female
well bully for you
janine walks over to pick up the box
i want to know
just exactly whats wrong with being a girl
its fuckin phenomenal if you happen to be one
maybe we shouldve had this conversation the other afternoon
that wasnt my choice
i sure as hell didnt make you do it
janine will you just let me talk to him for a sec
its a guy thing
give me a fuckin break
janine storms off with the box
she talked me into it
you know janine
keenan picks up his bike gets on
you do like bein a dude right
keenan grins rides off
calling back you should thank me
the one she picked out was pink
luke passes a sidewalk trash can and notices the gift box mangled inside
glancing around to make sure no ones watching he pulls the dress out brushes off some dirt
he shoves it back in the trash stares at it
luke kneels on the floor stocking candy shelves
the chime bings
he peers over the aisle looks around no one in sight
michelle appears by the soda dispenser wary of him
how are you
as they talk michelle maneuvers to get closer
luke maneuvers to keep his distance
you look really nice
i was hopin you might call
i was going to
theres something i need to talk to you about
but did i do something wrong
nothin like that
theres just some stuff ive got to sort out
they gaze at each other across the magazine rack a mountain range of silence between them
theres nothing you cant tell me
what did you want to talk to me about
they stand silent beneath the hum of fluorescent lights
so heard you and max really got into it
i kind a lost it
he knows how to push buttons huh
what exactly did he say that got you so pissed off
i dont know
wed just finished a game
i was all revved up
hes actually a really nice guy
not sure hes too crazy about me seein his sister
did he scare you off
no he doesnt scare me
what his struttin around thinkin hes such a bad ass with his shirt hangin open half the time
lukes surprised and embarrassed by his own words
michelle steps away confused
its just an act
he likes pretending hes joe cool
always says you gotta just be whatever you want and fuck em if they cant take a joke
well hes a joke alright
look im not sure this is gonna work out
im sorry i didnt mean no
i cant do this
im not sure you even know who you are
much less who i am
have you ever even had a girlfriend
whats that supposed to mean
well if you think my brothers such a joke how much better could you think of me
were not that different you know
youre totally different
hes a guy for one
and hes my best friend
if you dont like him you cant like me
luke kneels in the aisle stocking shelves distracted fidgety distressed
he glances up at the magazine rack
a female fitness magazine catches his attention
the beautiful cover model seems to move
he stares at it no movement
luke approaches the rack and flips over the magazine cover
as he steps away he glances back at the rack the adonis on the cover comes to life
he rips off his shirt as he moves off one magazine cover and into another where he passionately kisses the bikini clad cover model
the models and others on half a dozen covers begin stripping down moving to other magazines and making out with each other all across the rack
the windows glow among the dark trees
inside luke rips up covers hurling magazine after magazine across the floor
michelle leans against the shower wall staring at the spray of water upset
steam rises filling the bathroom
she begins singing longingly
i wanna know how to go to the inside of love
i cant find my way through
washing herself behind the shower curtain the timbre of her singing voice mysteriously shifts
as her hand turns the shower faucet it changes
im outside of love to the side or above i cant find my way with you
a glimpse of her shoulder behind the shower curtain grows more muscular and her voice begins lowering in pitch
as michelle becomes max
must be a special view finding a me with a you on the inside of love
max steps out of the shower and towels off in the mirror
a persistent knock on the door
sydney pulls on a robe over a pair of mens boxers wiping sleep from her eyes
she swings the door open
luke stands outside in pouring rain
sydney pours hot tea
youre one too
why didnt you tell me
i didnt want to confuse the issue
so its true what you said
you really know
i wouldnt change unless i wanted to
maybe some part of you
how much of me
i mean for it to work
more than half
what if it was only a tiny bit a thought
i dont know
but i believe there may be thousands of zs out there millions for all we know go their whole lives without even knowing they are one
nothing ever happens
you couldnt keep it from happening
i love being with michelle
how come i cant control it when shes around
i think whatever part of yourself you deny just gets bigger and bigger until it takes you over
luke nods sadly
you think i dont really want to be a man
i think for some making it stop is more important than knowing who you are
it was for me
maybe for me too
right now youre morphescent
the key is to have sex with another z
you become adulmorphic
your gender locks
you cant just change anytime you want
thats why i came all the way out here
and why you keep tryin to get me in the sack
thought maybe i could save you some distress
but you say youre not attracted to me
for it to work both of us have to be into it
that wont be a problem
not right now
acres of empty grass
luke sits at the top of a hill by his dads grave
remember that christmas when keen and me accidentally set the scofields house on fire
he stares up at the sky
and that burning shingle drifted over and lit up the robertsons place
the whole town was ready to lynch us and we snuck back home
two am you were up drinkin coffee
he tugs out hunks of grass
i thought you were gonna kill us
but you just looked me right in the eye and said son theres leftover pizza in the fridge
a tear rims his eye
that was the coolest thing anyone ever said
dad im in such trouble
i feel like if i let this thing in its all over
but i dont know what else to do
guess you cant figure out who you are until you accept who you might be
department store shopping bags and boxes are strewn across the bed
sydney checks herself out in the full length mirror
a mans gray tuxedo jacket over lingerie
the giant work floor of the abandoned mill
sunlight beams through holes in the roof
max on roller blades practices guiding the hockey puck along the floor
he stops when he notices the figure watching him from outside the giant metal doors luca in the blue dress on roller blades hockey stick in hand
youre about the last person i expected to see
i can show you a few moves if you want
what the hell
luca demonstrates hockey technique expertly guiding a hockey puck through an obstacle course of broken equipment timber and sawdust piles
all the while she dodges maxs attempts to steal the puck
max finally gets it which riles luca
she hip checks max
they swerve to avoid a pipe crash landing on top of each other on a sawdust pile
they bust out laughing
youre better than luke
i taught him everything he knows
luca pulls away from max suddenly self conscious that maxs leg is on top of hers
awkward from the broken connection they gaze up at the blue sky through a hole in the roof
i thought you left town
had to come back
whered you learn to speak italian
just tourist stuff
ill have the spaghetti bolognese
how much for a room
have you been
in new york
want to go with me
max leans over and kisses luca
she responds tentatively at first then as she grows more confident
her face reddens she gasps
luca pulls back self conscious confused
she brushes sawdust off her dress stands
look this was a mistake
looking up luca sees keenan staring at them from across the floor incredulous
keenan exits out through the giant doors
are you and he
its really none of my business
i shouldntve come here
max stands brushes off the sawdust
please dont say youre just visiting
that you need to leave
im the one who needs to leave
max skates off across the giant shop floor
the semi truck is parked alone in the middle of the asphalt
from inside the cab the blue dress flips over the rolled down window
keenan leans against a tractor rolls his eyes and twists open another beer which he gulps
luke hops down from the truck cab wearing langford u
sweats and a t shirt
keenan sits on the running board
i mean what the fuck is goin on
you do wanna be a girl
youre into guys now
i dont know exactly
i dont know
keenan downs his beer pensive
he crushes the can and hurls it smacking a garbage can
what about michelle
i had to be sure
i am now
come on its sort of a catch
i make out with a girl i start turning into one
you gotta admit its a little weird isnt it
suddenly uncomfortable sitting so close to luke keenan stands
lets get outta here
you want a ride somewhere
why dont you go see her
think youre more her type
keenan picks up his bike
ill see ya round okay
see me around
look im gonna find my own place okay
this is gettin too fuckin weird for me
im goin to dr
to make this stop
i dont care
ive had it with all this crap
i mean you gonna start hittin on me next
yeah thats right keenan you and me lets do it
keenan rides off leaving luke shell shocked
sydney wears a stunning black silk evening gown
small greek statues now adorn the room
i guess i really did need to face it head on in order to see
it was courageous
girls are just i dont know
its a different energy
theyre soft and warm they can make a guy feel complete
and multiple os
actually male zs have multiple os too
been so long i nearly forgot
okay to be honest im relieved you sorted this out
my conscience would have bothered me for decades if wed just gone ahead without you being certain
sydney pops a cork and pours herself and luke glasses of champagne
so how does this work
we just do it
it just happens
luke and sydney begin undressing
do you like this dress
looks great on you
even without everything else dresses are reason enough right there to stay a guy
sydney takes this in considers
stay a guy
let me get this straight
you didnt decide to be a woman
of course not
sydney realizing her mistake regroups plan b
just testing you
hold on a moment
theres something i forgot
she retrieves some rope
whats that for
youve never done it with another z
trust me you need to be tied down
does it hurt
on the contrary
the alabaster eyes of a small greek statue stares blankly in the direction of the carnal sounds coming from the bed off just let yourself go completely
wow this is intense
when two zs do it the lateral hypothalamus gets completely overwhelmed
cellular fission kicks in and well
you can go zytusional
the chiseled eyes of a two foot statue of david blankly stare
lukes voice begins rising in pitch
what have you done
luca the sounds escalate growing increasingly more intense culminating in the extraordinary never before heard
a great looking bare chested guy with sydneys hair appears in reflection male sydney
behind him still strapped to the bed is now luca a gag in her mouth
male sydney carries a phone while fussing with his hair in the mirror
into phone i hear youre the best
yes its an emergency
or ill have to cut it myself
to luca now you look me in the eye and tell me that wasnt the best sex you ever had
luca moans struggles violently
into phone half an hour
male sydney clicks the phone off
you can have all my clothes
oh and i just bought these incredible anna felucci pumps
reconsiders maybe i should keep those
male sydney returns to dressing a ribbed tank beneath a gray italian tux
okay i wasnt completely honest with you but i never lied either
that is what you wanted
youre adulmorphic now
the only way to switch is to do it with another z
he gazes at luca a pang of guilt
he sits on the bed speaks softly
i know you dont believe me but this is the right thing for you
eventually youll figure that on your own
but i could tell it was just gonna take way too long
luca stares distraught
oh for chris sake
being a woman doesnt make you any less of a man
the entire bed lurches back and forth as luca struggles
male sydney winces pangs of guilt which turn to anger
i cant live my whole life wrong cause of one stupid mistake
im a man
i love havin this chest these arms
but most of all
grabs his pant crotch welcome home boys
hang in there im takin you out for a spin
luca lies alone in the room bound and gagged on the bed
a knock at the door
luca moans and tries to yell through her gagged mouth
the knock persists
the ivy parts and keenan peers in
his eyes go wide
he pushes the window open a little whispers
whats goin on
where is she
luca moans and struggles against the ropes
i guess i really didnt think you were gonna go this way
keenan sits on the edge of the bed
luca moans trying to get keenan to remove the gag
hang on a sec
look im sorry about earlier what i said
but all this stuff
janine and i split up
luca stops struggling shocked
all i ever did was piss her off
im not sure she even wants a guy
and you think im so much better with girls than you and sure i can get laid anytime i want but truth is i never even woulda hit on her
if it werent for watchin you
keenan climbs on top of luca starts untying her hands straddling her
the way you just talk to em about anything like it was okay
i gotta get her back man
with herculean effort keenan struggles to hold back tears
its like the whole worlds blown apart
man you havin tits now is just weird
the truck thunders along through the trees head lamps blazing dashboard lights bright
keenans at the wheel
janine said hes definitely there
did she mention me
luca indicates no
god im glad you want to be a guy
you are absolutely sure right
cause it really is totally cool either way
okay i just dont want you to think im zerophobic or somethin
students gather outside the farmhouse pool hall
male sydney spots his prey and approaches jeremy who hangs out alone on the grass near a small bonfire
the firelight licks their faces
youre on the wrestling team
you catch the meets
just an educated guess
jeremy laughs glances around unsure what to make of him
the truck careens around a curve
cant this thing go any faster
you know me better than anyone
what do you think
i mean if i werent a hundred percent sure which im sposed to be
if you had to say
all i know is every time you look at michelle or think about her you smile
what the hell else do you need to know
its not right
she deserves to be with a normal guy
so you dont get to be with anyone
they drive in silence
that why they call it zero philia
shes not gonna want some guy who thinks maybe hes supposed to be a girl sometimes
how do you know
did you ask
no way im gonna ask her that
well you have to
where are your nads man
luca glares at him
keenan realizes his mistake
well get em back
the truck roars on
as janine looks on male sydney moves in for the kill
come on lets grab a couple beers
sydney tugs at his t shirt
of course i see you brought your own six pack
keenan and luca hop down from lukes truck scanning the crowd
janine waves to luca and points across the way
she wont even look at me
they stride across the field
male sydney shoves jeremy passionately against the wall
i do love to mess with texas
keenan and luca appear around the corner
we better get outta here
keenan reaches them first
he wrenches male sydney and jeremy apart
its not the way it looks
oh jeremy i so profoundly dont care if youre queer
trust me around here thats nothin
luca catches up and tackles male sydney throttling him on the ground
you son of a bitch
were doin it again right now
she your wife
she just said she wants sex
to luca i cant
it wont work
were goin inside right here
ill scream rape
so will i
they pull male sydney toward the barn door
but im gay
we both need to be into it or nothing happens
jeremy moves off wide eyed and disturbed
thats why i became a woman in the first place
i couldnt handle it
figured if i was female it was okay to like guys
male sydney shakes his head no
youre tellin me cause youre straight as a girl and im straight as a guy we can screw and switch but
cause youre straight as a girl and im gay as a guy even if we do it
im just screwed
you need trigonometry to figure this thing out
maybe youre bi
in my world the kinsey scales three dimensional but trust me girls do nothing for me
to keenan you on the other hand
what am i gonna do
what if hes lying
i say do him again anyway
waste of time
luca notices michelle standing nearby
its not what you think
keenan and luca realize that shes luca right now not luke
what does she think
im not sure
michelle moves off
luca runs up
i dont believe this
you slept with that guy
its not what you think
what about max
what about him
dont you care about him at all
not like that im straight
im attracted to you
oh who cares you idiot
and sorry to break it to you but im straight too
thisll sound crazy but im not who you think i am oh christ luke luca i know who you are
luca stares stunned
you know im a zerophiliac
so you can just go fuck yourself
does max know who i am
what if he does
hes a guy
and youre a girl
michelle gestures oh really
im not supposed to be
theres no supposed to be anything you just are
is that what you think
well then congratulations
youre a guy just like every other guy i ever met
i cant believe you slept with him
he was a woman
i was tricked
i didnt know id switch
michelle stares incredulous
youre gonna tell me hes a z too
both of you
well thats just perfect
what is there something in the water around here
she told me it would make it stop
that it would keep me from turning into a girl
whys that so important to you
theres no way this was gonna work
because im a zerophiliac
because you cant stand being one
correcting her luke
she glances back sad and angry
luca watches her go distraught and then runs
luca collapses on the ground overlooking polly wogs
janine and keenan run up a few yards behind
they sit nearby catching their breath unsure what to say
luca gazes up at the moon
whats it like
to really make love
they all three gaze up at the moon
keenan steals a glance at janine
the best parts just lyin there after
really close really far away
like goin to the moon maybe
they should open a pizza joint up there
janine glares at him and keenan winces
what am i gonna do
maybe being a womanll turn out okay
like being an elevated member of the male species
i just mean maybe hell learn to like it
sarcastic to keenan as hard as that is to conceive
both of you
what you want a written guarantee
youre so damn lucky
youre into him hes into you
what the hell else do you need to know
janine looks to keenan with a look of remorse hopeful
i think youre the female half of me
i think youre the macho half of me
and i dont know what half of who the hell i am
they look to luca surprised
then all three bust out laughing
what are you gonna do
i dont know
i prefer being a guy but im a girl
im attracted to max but im in love with michelle
its like im sposed to be both
her own admission surprises her
not too practical
but at least now i know
she almost laughs sad but relieved
the place is cleared out save for polly cleaning up behind the bar and max alone shooting pool
how about we get a game in before dawn
max nods sets up a new rack
whats the point
it never works out
or they just cheat on you anyway
liverpool was a veritable shagfest when i was your age
a boulevard of broken hearts
but eventually i found him
she sinks the cue ball in a corner pocket
then he died
everything reminded me of him
so i came here half way round the world to forget
then created this place just like the one where we met
he cant handle this
he cant handle who he is
you being a guy too
or him being a girl
pollys confused but presses on
but once you really know someone and they know you it makes you whole
no one wants to know who i really am
youre so sure
he was the one person i thought could understand
but no its impossible
max puts the cue stick down and moves off
polly calls after
its worth finding out
max slides out from under an old car
seeing luca he hardens wiping his greasy hands on a rag
i know she doesnt want to talk to me
but do you know where i can find her
left two days ago
just til friday
max returns to his work
i wanted to apologize to her
forget it i dont know
obviously nothings gonna ever be with me and her but i just wish she knew how much i and that i wasnt cheating i was just trying to be a
man for her
laughs shed have a field day with that one huh
if you talk to her please just tell her im sorry and i wish her the best
luca nods not fully understanding maxs response
to you too
mixed signals i guess
max walks toward the back then yelps wincing
son of a bitch
you all right
stepped on a nail
max sits on a crate starts untying his boot
so you gettin used to this at all
you definitely had me confused
for whatever its worth
i think youre a pretty hot guy
but youre not interested
truth is i am
and i guess it sounds crazy but i couldnt do that to michelle
luca moves off as max removes his boot and his sock
for whatever its worth i think youre pretty hot too
too bad youre a moron
i have incontrovertible proof
luca stares at max and then down at his ankle at the tattoo max meets her eyes and it finally dawns on luca standing in shock and now putting it
all together she lunges for him nailing him to the ground kissing him
she rips maxs t shirt as they fall to the asphalt knocking over oil cans
luca manhandles max shoving him against a pile of huge tires as maxs face transforms
michelle slams back onto the crabgrass
she pulls luca toward her as lucas face transforms into luke
luke and michelle roll on the crabgrass kissing transforming as they roll into luca and max and michelle and luke and luca or was that max
white gauze curtains billow in the morning breeze
the suns first rays light up the down comforter and white pillows
michelle stirs slowly then bolts awake
she grabs luke a vise grip around his torso
he awakens groggy
michelle bites her lip embarrassed releases him
you still think im going to bolt dont you
and leave me stuck
what do you want a gender pre nup
i have to go to work
she nuzzles him playfully
luke glances at the clock moans
only place im going is back to sleep
i cant show up at work like this
he smiles folds into her
