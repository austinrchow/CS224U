href b b rush hour jeff nathanson a smoky haze dims the blazing sun
skyscrapers sit like watchtowers over the city where east meets west for five and a half million people a day
the american embassy u
and chinese flags side by side
hu li dark glasses exits and slowly moves toward a street vendor across the street
she pays for an order of pork bao as she takes her first bite we see two offices on the sixth floor blown out a huge fireball erupting over one
side of the embassy
people panic and run
hu li doesnt even flinch
she takes a bite of her pork bao as she casually turns to the stunned street vendor
chinese subtitled someone better call the police
the passenger window rolls down and we see carter styling in a chinese cut suit
hes holding a chinese english dictionary leaning out the window giving his best do me look to two girls in a convertible
int chinese deng wa lu yun cai shen wu
the horrified girls speed off and carter turns to lee who is driving and singing to his radio
singing wish they all could be california
wish they all could be california girls
carter ejects the beach boys cd from the stereo and tosses it out of the sunroof
i warned you about playing that shit when im in the car

a call comes in over the following conversation is in chinese english subtitles

carter follows lee out of the car the two men making their way to the door of the raven club
carter is combing his hair getting himself ready for a night on the town stopping when he spots two hot women walking into the club
thats what im talking about
a real hong kong night club

your breath has been a little funky all day

carter looks at lee
fixes his collar

carter dances through the door lee follows
a dark upscale club that is packed with gangsters beautiful girls and civilians
lee and carter walk in
lee is trying to keep a low profile as carter stares up at the stage where a man sings karaoke the most painful rendition of michael jacksons dont stop till
you get enough
ill meet you at the bar in ten minutes
they dont like tourists in here so try to blend in
im two feet taller than everyone here
where you going
lee walks off trying not to be seen as carter steps up to the bar takes a seat next to two chinese thugs
how you boys doing tonight
the thugs ignore carter as he motions to the stage where the old man continues to sing
that is the worst singing ive ever heard
that sounds like something youd hear in prison after lights out
the thugs continue to ignore carter
lee makes his way down a hallway looks through an open door sees a private room
several triads are using hi tech machines to count stacks of american hundred dollar bills
get closer to my body now
and just love me till you dont know how
lee steps back into shadow does a double take as he realizes hes hearing carter belting out dont stop till a room full of chinese sitting with their mouths open
watching carter on the karaoke stage doing a dead on michael jackson singing his heart out
dancing and making eyes at a few of the smitten women who are watching him
whispering from side of stage carter get off that stage
are you kidding they love me
im a star lee
a god to these people
carter resumes singing really getting down
moonwalking to the edge of the state where lee pulls him off
this is a gangster bar were here undercover

im just starting to have fun
beat well fine then go ahead pull your badge and do your thing

before lee can react carter has lifted lees badge and gun
carter bounds back on stage pulls the plug on the music and fires three shots into the ceiling silencing the bar
chinese deng wa lu yun shen wu wattu masu wang lui
strange looks from the crowd
carter turns to lee
whispering whatd i say
you just said youre their worst nightmare and to line their mothers up for a milking
cmon get up here and help me out
reluctantly lee gets on stage
more looks from the chinese as carter speaks lee translating
okay all the triads and ugly women go to that side all fine ass women on this side
carter fires two more shots in the ceiling
lets try this again
who here knows ricky tan raise your hand
who here is named lee
raise your hand
now i know youre lying
the crowd still hasnt moved
except in the back where lee spots several gangsters leaving
as lee runs off stage as they run out i come back and catch yall singing michael jackson and youre all going to jail
lee and carter run into the street just in time to see hu li and several gangsters round a corner
lee takes off and chases them on foot
the far end of the street is blocked by market stalls
the gangsters look around frantically
an apartment building is under construction massive bamboo scaffolding top to bottom
their only way out is up
lee and carter dash around the corner to see the gangsters swarming up the scaffolding
lee wastes no time going after them
with a running start he jams a foot on the wall and vaults to the bottom rung grabs hold and swings up
hang on lee
carter jumps to grab hold of the scaffolding
not even close
he backs up hes gonna take a running start
above lee reaches gangsters
they all tear off the lengths of bamboo and square off
the clatter of wood against wood as they beat at each other
wrestling over his pole lee flings two of the gangsters over the edge
below carter has hold of the bottom rung straining mightily to pull himself up
just as he gets his chin above the bar
it breaks and he drops
the two gangsters crash land on either side of carter
he takes one look at their pain
he dashes into the stairwell
above the last two gangsters come at lee
he stomps down levering up floor boards which see saws them off balance
with the advantage he batters them with his bamboo pole and knocks them off
he climbs after the gangster leader
on hu li and the gangsters coming over the crest of the hill seeing carter climbing up the hill
lee pulls himself up onto the roof takes a few steps when wham
he is clocked by a foot bamboo pole
lee topples over the edge
we see his adversary for the first time
as she steps to the edge
the stairwell door flies open and carter emerges
gun low and ready
hu li is gone
out of breath freeze
carter goes to the edge and sees lee hanging on a pole below
carter is blind sided by hu li
she takes one sultry step towards him then twists her heel and windmills a hard kick that sends carter flying off the he falls along the side of the building
he manages to grab the end of a bamboo pole that juts out from the scaffolding
theyre hanging side by side holding on for their lives
hu li looks down at them
she has no weapon to finish them off
she turns and runs disappearing in the night
holding on with all their strength
the bamboo is starting to bend
all i wanted was a little mu shu
try to land on your feet
carter looks down at a rancid dumpster below them
i cant believe i flew ten thousand miles for this shit
the pole breaks carter and lee drive through hong kong the two men riding in silence bruised and covered in garbage
you lied to me
i got somebodys old chopsticks stuck in my ass so dont tell me youre sorry
just take me home
there was an explosion at the american embassy today two american translators were killed
carter takes this in
cant believe his own bad luck
so that ricky tan hes the one who blew up the embassy
lee and carter walk into a massive courtyard where thirty year olds are going through their warm up routines
master fu s wears a black robe as he teaches his kids
im telling you right now im tired of this shit
theres two billion chinese let one of them be your partner
this wont take long
master fu barks out a barrage of shaolin fighting stances
like well trained army the students yell and kick hard
the students yell and form an x with their arms
master fu notices carter and lee watching from the back
the students exchange baffled looks
staring straight at lee twisting tiger
lee may be a big rusty but he puts on a shit kicking move that leaves the students blown away
lee smiles basking in the glow
until he sees master fus disappointment
didnt i teach you to always arch your back
bowing humbled yes master
while lee follows master fu carter stands in front of the year olds who sit motionless around a fighting circle
carter starts stretching his legs warming up
i was watching you kids
my name is carter lapd and im a third degree black belt
at least thats what i tell the girls at the holiday health spa where i work out
carter throws a series of quick punches but the kids have no reaction
let me give you kids some tips
the key to kung fu is the follow through
why dont you stand up
the kids dont move no reaction
carter continues to throw punches
go ahead kick me hit me
ill show you how to block
come on stand up give me your best shot try to kick right to my head
the kids still dont move
carter working up a sweat from shadow fighting takes off his jacket draping it over the holy buddha behind him a mistake
he swings back around to face the kids and never sees the kick that sends him flying back onto the mat
he looks around and sees all of the kids standing in fighting position
thats pretty good
which one of you kids did that
lee and master fu walking
i need your help master
im seeking a man who used to train with you
hes become a killer the worst kind of animal
animals kill only from hunger or fear
the man you seek is lower than a serpent
faces lee he kills for money
in the b
we see the kids leaping acrobatically over carter from all sides
carter frustrated tries to grab the kids out of the air as they fly by but they elude him
they disappear o
lee and master fu walk another moment master fu lost in thought
he was the best i ever trained you know
lee reacts your father and ricky tan were my favorite students
and for such awful things to happen as they did lee cuts off master fus reminisces hes obviously uncomfortable
how do i find ricky tan
again in the b
carter and the flying kids go zipping by in the other direction disappear o
master fu pats the soil around a struggling plant
a seeding spends its entire life reaching towards heaven
i know master but
the answers you seek can be found in heaven on earth
heaven on earth
master i dont understand
working it a temple where heaven is on earth
a mountain where earth reaches for the its a massage parlor downtown
heaven on earth
you will find your answers there
lee bows to master fu slowly turns to walk back down the pathway
put a c note in the jar
lee puts a few bills in the jar heads down a pathway
master fu walks over and takes the cash
lee emerges from the path stops when he sees carter two students headlocked under each arm another two scissor locked between his legs holding another two down with his hands
and sitting on the last one
and thats how you use the lapd choke hold
now start practicing and dont make me come back here
you ready to have some fun
a neon light hangs above the upscale massage parlor
just follow my lead and act like a tourist
i am a tourist
lee and carter walk into an upscale massage parlor and stand in a lobby
soft music is playing
good afternoon gentlemen
lee bows followed by carter
in chinese hello

the hostess takes carter by the arm walks over to a hidden sliding door slides it open to reveal twenty beautiful women
carter truly is in heaven

to lee your friend have big appetite
handing robes to lee and carter please put these on and wait upstairs in the quiet room
twenty men in silk robes lie in reclining chairs women massaging their feet and hands
there are big screen tvs showing nature films relaxation music playing in the background
lee and carter sit in the quiet room dressed in matching purple robes
lee wears slippers carter wears his high tops
carter is enjoying a hand and neck massage at the same time
a woman walks over and hands them each a drink
now im on vacation
i knew youd come through lee
lee doesnt respond
lee is staring at someone on the far side of the room
a man who radiates a unique blend of sophistication and brutality
over there thats ricky tan
thats ricky tan
hes four feet tall
ill go over with you right now shake him down
this is a very dangerous man
im a dangerous man
youre not gonna ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat
im calling for back up
lee gets up from a chair hurriedly exits
carter looks at ricky tan sitting quietly in his chair with his laptop computer on his knees
carter makes a decision gets up and walks towards him
ricky tan ive been looking all over for you
tan looks up for a moment a smile
im busy at the moment
i said get on your feet
i know you detective carter right

enjoying your visit
im lees new muscle his right arm and dont let the robe fool you
this is the only color they had left

tan laughs goes back to his laptop
carter grabs the laptop from ricky and throws it across the room shattering it against the wall
ricky glances at his men who are seated around the room waiting to move
i told you to get on your feet
having heard the commotion lee arrives by carters side breathless as tan looks up surprised
lee ive missed you brother
getting up giving lee a hug i heard about the two americans im so sorry you must be under great pressure
you must come with me for questioning
ive got girls and chicken and hot oil waiting for me
i dont think so
a nod of ricky tans head and ten large men in robes and towels spring out of reclining chairs menacingly facing lee and carter
id like to pay you for that laptop
its no problem
but i must excuse myself inspector
thats chief inspector he got promoted
tan bows to lee and carter
and good day
as tan starts to exit lee and carter move to intercept him
but they are blocked by tans men
lee grabs one of the mens towels and pulls it off
the man covers his naked body
lee is grabbed by one of the other henchmen but he escapes and begins kicking ass using the towel and his own robe to block and wrap another mans arms
blocking kicking and punching everything in sight all the while managing to keep his privates covered with a towel his robe or some other found object
carter meanwhile uses his quick hands to send several men flying back grabbing a towel of one of them
ref his privates damn
no wonder youre pissed off
carter uses the towel like lee did to block and trap one of the mens punches
in the middle of fighting lee is suddenly exposed he flinches to cover himself and is punched from behind
momentarily stunned hes lifted from behind two men throwing him out the front door
carter is also overpowered by two men who lift him over their shoulders
ricky tans black limo screeches to a stop
the door flies open and lee and carter are tossed out onto the highway
both men are completely naked
a packed street lee and carter dodging in and out of people
the camera pans and we see lee and carter from behind
goddamn you got a small ass
dont look at my ass
the station is packed with americans fbi agents secret service
theyve set up shop right in the middle of the bullpen
superindendent chin is arguing with special agent sterling a year old hard ass who is in charge of this circus
chin you have been ordered by the ministry of public security to assist the fbi and secret service with our investigation to provide us with whatever we need
if you have information it belongs to us
this is still hong kong
two americans have been killed on united states government property this is our investigation
chief inspector lee will brief your people
he will report to me
do we understand each other
suddenly all eyes turn as carter and lee enter the bullpen
out of breath still robed lee covering himself with a trash can lid carter using a red construction cone
who the hell is that
humiliated that is
chief inspector lee
the detective in charge of our investigation
put a diaper on him chin
i want to talk to the great inspector lee
the shades are down as lee frantically gets dressed putting on a suit and fixing his tie
carter finishes putting on a black chinese style suit from lees closet then moves for the door
where are you going
back to heaven on earth
i need my damn passport back
im going home
who needs you
why you mad at me
you needed back up so i backed you up
i was about to take out ricky tan and those bodyguards

whens the last time you had some fun
whens the last time you took a night off had a date
i have plenty of dates
whens the last time you had some mu shu lets hear it lee when was it

and you aint black
the two men look at each other for a long beat
lee quickly walks out slamming the door behind him leaving carter half dressed
lee walks in sees sterling sitting at chins desk
chin stands in the back
lee this is special agent sterling from the united states secret service
the secret service
what im about to tell you cannot leave this room
the men who were killed yesterday were not american translators
they were undercover u
customs agents trying to break a triad smuggling ring
we dont know what theyre transporting out of hong kong but whatever it is it got the agents killed
how can we help
stay the hell out of our way
i can get to ricky tan
we know all about tan
thats why were leaving him out there as bait
we think this is a lot bigger than just ricky tan and his fu cang long triads
carter is on the phone his feet on lees desk
as he talks he opens a drawer pulls out a wad of cash and pockets it
captain youre gonna have to speak up
im on a car phone
captain diel sits behind his desk talking on the phone
is it true carter

there was a dinner last night two hundred lapd officers were there
two hundred cops

he owes me money
ive waited my whole life for this job but i dont have a shot in hell of getting it
do you know why

and what the hell is heaven on earth
sir im working on a big case over here and by the time i get back theyre gonna make you governor
captain you there
as carter walks out the door he brushes past hu li who is standing in the hallway disguised as a fed ex delivery person
carter checks her out as he exits
carter starts walking down the street making his way past an outdoor butcher market getting strange looks from locals and tourists alike
he motions to an old woman who is selling how you doing
can you direct me to the heaven on earth massage parlor
the old woman stares at carter starts motioning to her cages filled with birds
no i dont eat live birds
i like my birds dead and deep fried
you ever been to popeyes
the woman takes out a bird holds up a hatchet
no dont do that i had a big lunch
im warning you im a police officer just put the blade down and let the bird go
lee walks out of the captains office heads for his own office but never gets there
an explosion rips through the second floor of the station
lee diving for safety as glass and debris shoot over his head
sheer pandemonium as lee quickly looks up at his destroyed office tries to get to his feet
stunned police officers and detectives are crowded around lees office looking at the rubble
lee pushes through the crowd its all smoke and fire
now way anyone held back by the heat
carter walks down the street holding a cage with a live red bird inside
he stops a man who is sweeping in front of his store
how you doing
im looking for heaven on earth
the man stares at carter watches as he pulls out his shan shui cao guo jiu pao gai niu tao zi
you wish to spank my sister with a ping pong paddle
no man i was just asking
ill go see if shes awake
as the man walks into his store carter runs off
carter strolls back into frame peering into the store to see if its worth staying
lee sits by himself in shock
superindendent chin approaches
all he wanted was some mu shu
are you okay lee
im sorry i have to go
carter finally makes his way to the massage parlor moving for the front door when he sees ricky tan exit
carter ducks to the side and watches as ricky climbs into the back of a waiting daimler
the daimler drives off
carter rushes to the middle of the street with a determined look on his face
im gonna solve this case myself
carter flags down a cab jumps in the back seat
the cab driver turns to carter who motions to the limo
loud follow that limo
the cab driver continues to stare at carter
you understand what im saying
follow that car
where it goes you go
this is a chase we are chasing that limo
beat we are still parked were not moving
this is the opposite of chasing drive the car or i will kill you
the driver slowly turns holding out his hand
carter fishes in his pocket hands the cab driver a wad of cash
now you speak my language
lee drives misty eyed
rap music playing over the stereo
lee turns it up slowly moving his head to the music in tribute to carter
his cell phone rings he turns down the music
lee we just got a call from the harbor patrol
ricky tan is throwing a little party on his boat tonight
if you dont want to
did you tell sterling
let him find out on his own
i want the hong kong police handling this
lee hangs up
a look of intensity
he cranks the rap music up a man on a mission
a foot yacht is anchored in victoria harbor
ricky tan walks along the top deck with hu li disappearing into a crowd of people who are partying on the ship
carter steps out of the cab
ill be right back
carter steps out of the cab which immediately drives off leaving him alone on the docks
carter looks around the dock a pull up valet station parking fancy cars rich people getting on the boat as their names are checked off a list by two doormen
a huge party a live band plays for a crowd of business men politicians and beautiful women a whos who of hong kong
carter walks up to the front of the boat two doormen holding clipboards immediately stop him
im with the band

the band has been playing over an hour

as carter walks past the doorman wait

carter cuts a smoking dance move
can you do that
man shakes head no thats why youre down here and im up there
now this is my party dont forget it
carter walks onto the ship starts singing to himself
the ships horn sounds the yacht starts to head out to sea
lee steps out of his car sees the yacht is pulling out of the slip
he runs along the side of the boat has no choice but to jump from the end of the pier landing hard on the side of the ship somehow holding
onto a porthole window
he clings to the yacht then throws himself toward a hanging lifeboat climbs up the side and jumps toward the top rail as carter walks through the ship he grabs
a handful of food from a waiter his eyes searching the crowd rounds a corner almost stepping right into hu li whos approaching steven reign
steven reign is in his s perfectly groomed impeccably dressed his looks and bearing say one thing money
hes got the big party smile on but as hu li arrives reigns face shifts and his eyes go dead the billionaire as sociopath
carter steps back but sees reign whisper to hu li
carter hides and turns away as hu li instinctively scans the room for signs of trouble
he heads into the main party
carter stops walking when he comes upon isabella molina a stunning brunette sitting at the bar drinking a glass of champagne
carter lights her cigarette for her
how you doing baby

carter nods waves
steven reign and isabella walk away
lee makes his way toward a staircase that is blocked by a bodyguard
he quickly disarms the guard and grabs him by the throat pushing him against the wall
where is he
the hong kong police
he killed a detective today and hes not getting away with it
now where is he
and dont play games or well kick your lying ass
lee slowly turns around and looks at carter who is standing right behind him
never met him
do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth
nobody understands the words that are coming out of your mouth
get your hands in the air
lee and carter turn to see four bodyguards standing in front of them with guns in hand
ricky tan is expecting you
it looks like hugh hefners bedroom complete with round bed and sunken bar
ricky tan sits in front of a big screen satellite tv screaming at the lakers
hu li opens the door and the bodyguards lead lee into the bedroom
come on shaq hit a damn free throw
you can do it big guy
we see shaq miss his free throw
he still doesnt follow through
i just lost five grand
tan turns off the tv turns to lee
why dont we go on the deck get some air

to hu li leave us alone
hu li hesitates upset at being dismissed
to lee could you have your partner wait for us outside
i aint his partner im a tourist

carter pulls lee aside
what leave you alone so he can cap you
im okay you go

he had us beat up
thats nasty shit
remember i told you my father was a policeman
beat ricky tan was his partner for ten years
pause what the hell is going on here
carter holds lees glance for a beat then turns and walks the other way
tan and lee reach the upper deck where they are alone
despite what people suspect
what you suspect dont
ricky tan hears the steel in lees voice acknowledges it
if your father were alive i would be turning to him now
beat i didnt blow up the american embassy but i believe some of my people did
my enemies are trying to frame me
beat there is a war going on within the triads and i am going to lose
my name has been written into the book of death
the police can protect you
nobody can protect me
ill make a deal with you lee
but only iff youll get me out of hong kong
tell me why they killed the customs agents
there is a ship in the hong kong harbor
hu li bursts onto the deck flanked by four bodyguards
ricky tan screams something at hu li in chinese
hu li screams back as she empties her gun into rickys chest
tan falls back over the rail and into the water
lee moves towards hu li but the four bodyguards are on lee attacking from all sides
hu li exits as lee tries to fight off the bodyguards
reactions from the crowd as gunshots echo from the deck above
hu li moves quickly down the hallway rounding a corner and suddenly goes flying landing flat on her face
its carter who ran to the sound of the gunshot and tripped hu li with his leg
all right get your hands up
hu li backflips up kicking carter in the head
lee takes down bodyguard but is still fighting three on one
a furious exchange of acrobatic blows between lee and bodyguard
carter and hu li face off
you wanna piece of me
cmon ill give you a little lapd ass kickin
hu li savages carter with a series of punishing blows
lee manages to defeat bodyguards and
as he catches his breath the sound of a speed boat starting its engines
lee runs to the rail looks down to see a speedboat starting to pull away from the ship
hu li jumps onboard the moving boat
lee starts to turn for the stairs running down towards the stern
lee and carter run up to the stern at the same time watching helplessly as hu li gets away in the speed boat
carter turns his head sees steven reign at the other end of the boat watching hu li escape not at all behaving like a panicky billionaire should during a gangland
wordlessly reign disappears back into the shadows
the yacht is anchored
a few triads led away in handcuffs
thrown into patrol cars that have surrounded the docks
sterling chin lee and carter on the dock
quite a night inspector
ricky tan was our only bait and now hes gone
you finally got your revenge at the expense of a u
what revenge is he talking about

i dont ever want to see you again you got that
hey you secret service man what are you stay out of it carter

sterling walks away disgusted
im sorry lee but my orders are to fully cooperate with the secret service
lee nods a respectful but bitter acknowledgment
chin motions for two uniformed hong kong police officers to approach
to police officers escort detective carter to the airport ill take him
the hong kong police officers produce handcuffs
to lee fine
but dont expect me to talk to you
carter stalks off

carter gets in lees face
the two men look like theyre about to come to blows

a long beat while lee considers what to say
five years ago my father was chief inspector working a big international smuggling case
ask me if i give a shit
lee waits a beat then drops the bombshell
ricky tan killed my father
carter is suddenly all ears listening intently now to lee
he found out his partner tan had been working for the triads all along
beat before my father could prove it he was killed in the line of duty
how the hell did tan get away with it
all the evidence against him disappeared the smuggling case was unsolved
tan resigned and went over to the triads openly
pause this is about your daddys death
hell lee you know my father died on the job
you could have told me
realizing this is about more than all that isnt it
this is about your daddys last case right
lees caught fibs badly
no no that would be crazy you thought the customs agents get blown up and smuggling and ricky tan and you put it all together and came up with a
five year old case
thats why you didnt tell me what we were doing
i thought youd think it was crazy
i am sorry
lee inclines his head stiffly turns and walks toward his car
carter watches him
finally he rolls his eyes and yells
so are you getting on the plane or not
come on we still got time to order the kosher meal
always get the kosher meal they bring it first
i cannot go to la
carter steps close and for a second we see the man and the cop beneath the attitude
it sounds impossible you said but if somebody gave me the chance to square up my fathers death id go to hell to do it
carter turns walks away without looking back
you want to figure out why they killed your daddy get on the plane
still not turning i guess youre going to have to trust me on this one
carter and lee are getting comfortable among all the other passengers preparing to take off
lee has a moment of doubt
i should go back
ricky tan mentioned a boat in hong kong harbor
lee let me introduce you to the carter theory of criminal investigation follow the rich white man
follow the rich white man
almost but youve got to say rich white man all run together like its one word
follow the richwhiteman
now every crime somewhere has a rich white man taking his cut
every single one
now in our case we know the rich white man is steven reign
big hotel billionaire
he was on ricky tans boat ordering hu li around just before ricky got smoked
how do you know hes our man
because when the shooting started he was way too cool
see most white people when theres shooting they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like aaaahhh

black people keep their cool when the shit goes down
but not like asians
we never panic
yeah what about when godzilla was coming

carter standing at a window holding high powered binoculars
lee standing next to him
we are cartons of chinese food are all over the sleazy run down hotel room
the lights low the curtains open a crack
traveling up the side of the reign hotel
stopping at the penthouse floor where we see isabella talking with steven reign in a hotel room
after a beat reign walks to the door
carter flips the binoculars to lee who starts watching

carter stares at lee for a long beat
lee maybe its best if we dont discuss our personal lives

lee lifts the binoculars turns back to the building

she walks to the bedroom where we see her through sheer curtains
slowly taking off her coat
lees eyes go wide as isabella drops her coat and starts to unbutton her blouse

isabella suddenly drops undressing and walks back to the living room to pick up the phone
we see her clearly now in bra and panties

we took an oath as police officers
if we dont do this who will
lee backs off and carter steps back to the window
he sees isabella hang up the phone

as she turns to the window
a tape recorder in hand
she puts the recording device away walks back into the bedroom and puts on a robe
i dont understand
shes walking back towards the door
we see isabella wearing a robe standing at the door of her hotel room talking with someone
she opened the door
someone is delivering a package
inside the hotel room we see hu li handing her a package
its the girl who delivered the package to your office
its a bomb
lee and carter bolt on the move sprinting out of the room
isabella closes the door
she brings the bomb with her as she walks into the bedroom carter and lee run across the street heading towards the entrance of the hotel
lee and carter sprint out the penthouse elevators running down the hallway
isabella takes her robe off glances at the package picks it up and starts to open it as lee and carter come bursting through the bedroom door
carter and lee stare at isabella who stands in bra and panties
damn girl you fine
lee lowers his eyes as isabella looks at him grabbing the bomb carter following him as they sprint out the bedroom
lee and carter run out the suite lee throwing the bomb toward the end of the hall as he and carter dive to the floor
lee looks up sees a hotel employee pushing a room service cart about to walk right past the package lee and carter run back to the bomb

carter picks it up starts running with it through the hall heading for the elevator
carter is about to throw it in when he sees an older couple do you want us to hold the elevator

carter is still holding the bomb doesnt know what to do with it stairs
carter throws him the bomb and lee runs to the stairs lee is about to throw the bomb down the stairwell when he sees two maids walking toward him
get out of the building
lee looks horrified as he hangs onto the package has no choice but to throw it back to carter
lee and carter burst through the roof door carter trying to hold the bomb as far away from himself as possible
he looks over the side for a place to dump it the streets are filled with people and cars
theres people down there
theres people up here
get it out of here
lee takes the bomb quickly rolls it across the roof lee and carter diving to the ground once again as the bomb slides to the center of the roof coming
to a stop right in front of isabella
shes wearing a bathrobe now clearly pissed off as she slowly bends down and picks up the package
get on your feet
lee and carter stand and face isabella watch as isabella begins to open the package
i wouldnt do that

isabella opens the package removing a stack of a hundred you see no bomb

lee examines the stack of hundred dollar bills from hu lis package
carter checks out the suite pocketing some of the food from the mini fridge
is this a payoff
its a sample
you guys ever heard of the superbill
its a myth
some kind of counterfeit
its much more than a counterfeit
out of world banks cant tell the difference
the paper is crane linen blend and the bills are printed on u
howre they getting into the u

treasury intaglio press
the only one to ever leave the country
five years ago ricky tan bought that press on the black market

lee and carter exchange looks
it wasnt hard to spot the fakes until this past year
then tan got hold of one of a kind swiss made hundred dollar plates and started making superbills
understanding and hu li killed him for the plates
theyve printed and shipped one hundred million dollars and theres only one way to spot a fake
isabella lights a hundred dollar bill on fire and it burns they use an optical transfer ink from india that burns red the real ink burns black
what the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money
the real question is where are the plates
if we can find the plates we can stop the whole operation
isabella thinks for a beat
maybe thats where you can help us
carter this is your city right
and lee you know hu li and the triads
okay find out where hu lis keeping the plates
hands lee a card with a phone number welcome aboard gentlemen
from this moment on youre working for the united states secret service
isabella opens the door to let lee and carter out
they exit quickly trying to hide their excitement
camera stays on isabella as she takes out her cell phone punches in a number
lee and carter are officially out of the secret services way
lee and carter both wearing dark sunglasses walk through the street trying their best to look like secret service agents
they approach carters parked vette
secret service agent carter

carters had the last word he gets into the vette
lee reluctantly gets in too
carters vette pulls up in front of a hole in the wall
carter and lee pass through the restaurant only two tables are occupied
carter and lee enter the busy kitchen where the owner a black man named kenny is yelling in chinese to an over worked waiter
kennys wife a spectacular looking chinese woman works the stove
a couple of cute half black half asian kids run around the kitchen

kenny looks up at carter
a cool appraising glance

kenny follows as carter opens a door to men seated around several card tables playing mah jongg for big money
lee and kenny follow carter inside
its very smokey and very crowded

including the vig brand new sequential hundred dollar bills
i knew something was wrong

kenny pushes a chinese painting aside to reveal a wall safe
he opens the safe and hands carter a bill
carter checks it out
carter takes out a lighter and holds the flame to it
whoa what are you doing
kennys question is answered as the bill burns bright red
pissed off i knew it
the guys name is zing
he works at the kitchen at reign plaza

youre off the hook
carter and lee move for the door
you sure you guys dont want to stay and have a bite
my wifes got the best mu shu this side of compton
carter and lee exchange a look as we cut to establishing
carter and lee park their car and walk inside
carter and lee enter
to a worker were looking for a guy named zing
is he here
zing hears carter turns and sees them
carter and lee exchange looks and run after him
zing sprints down an employee hallway through a doorway and down some stairs
carter and lee in pursuit
carter and lee burst out the door at the bottom of the stairway coming almost face to face with who has her gun out
waiting for them
isabella is standing near by and zing is visible off to the side
an wheeler in the loading bay is just being shut and locked
a limo is parked beside it
lee and carter both assume fighting positions
when most of the other workers pull guns other triad soldiers step out putting their guns close on lee and carter
they cant blink without getting mowed down
in chinese the great chief inspector lee i will be remembered for ridding the triads of your petulance
hu li savors the moment
i hope you just said i have no business being here cos i was just leaving
carter starts to leave and hu li trains her gun on him freezing him in his tracks
isabella slowly walks several feet ending up behind lee as she speaks
hu li i think theres someone who will want to talk to them first
hu li looks at isabella nods an acknowledgement
isabellas knocked him out from behind with the butt of her gun
carter drops to one knee as hu li pounds him across the jaw with her fist
oh thats a filling right there
thats gonna cost you
hu li lunges forward and kicks carter sending him backwards
put them in the truck
the workers pick up lee bring him to the back of the truck
i should kill you right now but im gonna let you live cause youre fine and maybe you can be reformed
the workers start towards carter
he holds up his hands
no more hitting
ill get in the truck myself
as carter walks towards the truck by hu li they exchange a look of sheer hatred
as soon as he passes by her hu li coldcocks carter with her gun
the eighteen wheeler the limo and the black lincoln town car pull out of the loading dock headed for the highway
the truck pulls onto a highway the limo close behind it
lee and carter are in the back with crates filled with money
theyre both in pain trying to recover from the head blows
carter is flexing his battered body
are you okay
whats the first thing i told you never trust nobody
how could you fall for that shit
i knew she was dirty
she saved our lives
for how long

lee looks disappointed

ricky tan didnt kill my father the fu cang long are not in south central

lee turns away from carter
as long as youre asking
i think you have a pretty good voice
i knew it
what does she know
you want me to sing something
how do the fu cang long usually kill their victims
theyll probably torture us first shock our privates then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head
sing your ass off
lee clears his voice
did you happen to see the most beautiful girl in the world
and if you did was she crying crying
the wheeler drives by followed by the limo
hu li and isabella sit in the back of one of the limos that is driving behind the truck
hu li is on the car phone
dont worry the plates are safe
yes the dragons been fed
she hangs up and glances at isabella who is doing her best to appear completely uninterested
the limo splits off from the wheeler
carter works at opening one of the crates
lee steps up takes a deep breath searches the crate looking for the sweet spot and punches a hole in one of the thick boards
they start prying the crate open
every opponent has a weak spot
you ignore everything around you and put all your energy into one perfect strike
ill remember that next time im fighting a box
carter opens the crate its filled with superbills about worth
he tosses a stack to lee
benjamin franklin he discovered electricity
a chinese man discovered electricity
no chinese man discovered electricity
yes he did
he also invented the bicycle
now that i believe
carter pockets two stacks of superbills
lee looks at him
you never know
besides i always wanted to die rich
the truck lurches
were slowing down
this must be it
end of the line
youve been a good friend james carter
oh no you dont

ill kick your ass from here to compton
you could never kick my ass

winks at lee thats more like it
the truck is parked in the underground loading docks
its approached by four triad soldiers
soldier opens the trucks double doors to find
lee and carter are gone
except for boxes of money the truck bed is empty
two soldiers enter the truck bed
lee and carter wedged up against the ceiling of the truck bed
above the doors and over the soldiers
lee and carter swing down in unison knocking both soldiers to the ground
in the next instant still holding on to the door frame swings and backflips onto the roof of the truck
who swings onto the ground grabbing one of the guards to use a shield as gunfire erupts
lee jumps off the truck knocking the last guard to the ground
he then grabs the guard carter is using as a shield and together they swing him into the truck knocking down the first two guards
carter and lee slam the back doors shut bolting them closed and run like hell scrambling into what looks like the closest way out a large open pipe on the
side of the tunnel
lee and carter run through it extends out from the underground loading docks
i see some lights
lee and carter spot a tiny sliver of light coming through a manhole cover
they start climbing up the metal stairs that lead up to the street
s packed with people and cars
lee and carter coming up from the manhole standing together in stunned disbelief as they look out at the las vegas strip
they cover their eyes blinded by the greatest light show in the world
i just got an idea how someone could launder a hundred million dollars in cash
they both turn around and come face to face with a ten story dragon
fire shoots from its nostrils every fire balls blow out over the strip as lee and carter look up at the red dragon
the huge neon sign reads grand opening lee and carter come out of the sewer
that was the name of ricky tans boat
lee and carter watch as limos pull up to the front of the hotel its like a hollywood premiere
the richest of the rich are making their way inside
wait a second
we cant go in like this
look at this place we gotta look fly
we gotta mac out
what is mac out
follow me my asian brother
carter and lee start to walk away
just stay down wind because i think you stepped in some serious rat shit down there
lee and carter are walking into the upscale clothing store
as they enter a salesman approaches them
may i help you gentlemen
carter flashes his biggest smile as he pulls out a stack of superbills
nothing touches this body but pure silk
and get my partner something from the childrens department
carter puts his hand on lees shoulder
would your partner like silk as well
i personally like it when a couple matches
carter takes his hand off lees shoulder
no you got it wrong theres no couple here
just two single police officers working a very dangerous case
we have lots of big men chasing us
im sure all the boys are chasing you two
dont worry ill make you guys the bell of the ball
he winks as he walks off and carter looks at lee
this is the last time i go shopping with you
lee and carter enter frame dressed to kill perfectly tailored couture versace suits gold watches the whole bit
le is awkward in player guise
whispering remember lee youre a player now
you own the place
carter pulls out his altoids and he and lee each take one as they walk through the doors
i own the place
carter struts through the lobby lee doing his best to imitate carters pimp and roll
they walk past the giant that looks exactly like my uncle darrell
buddha is the symbol of luck and good fortune
buddha is the symbol for fat and lazy
the man has the biggest tits in asia
they are moving through the main entry hall lined with terra cotta chinese soldiers posed and dressed for battle
rickshaws and bicycles take people through the hotel
the main casino is roped off and empty
people crowded around the perimeter a sign reads buy in everybodys a winner
the lights dim a spotlight comes on and finds steven reign on the balcony overlooking the entrance
a thousand years ago a small wealthy village in china hired a young dragon to guard their treasure in a cave hoping to scare off potential bandits
their plan worked quite well until the people of the village started sneaking the dragon extra food hoping to make him bigger and stronger
the dragon ate so much and grew so big that he eventually got stuck inside the cave and the treasure was stuck behind him for all eternity
beat ladies and gentlemen i have found that lost treasure
it is here inside the greatest casino in the world
welcome to the red dragon where everybody is a winner
reign smiles flips a switch the casino comes to life
fireworks bright lights endless rows of tables dealers waiting
a band plays on a stage in the casino lounge
chinese acrobats perform suspended from the ceiling and on the balconies above
applause all around as the flame shoots out of the dragons nostrils and the acrobats perform
carter and lee walk down the red carpet
to waitress bring us some twelve year old scotch
to a cigarette girl get us a box of your finest cigars
to a change girl give me ten dollars in nickels
dice rolling on a craps table
we see blackjack dealers busting paying out customers
hundred dollar slot machines paying out jackpots
gamblers winning all over the casino
then going to the main cage and exchanging their chips for superbills
look at this place lee
the biggest front in the world
as people pour into the casino steven reign is making his way through the crowd shaking hands and posing for pictures
here comes the rich white man
ill handle this
as carter walks off a woman grabs lee and pulls him onto the dance floor
the woman spins to face lee her face half hidden under the dance floor lights
put your arms around me
isabella grabs him around the waist pulls him close
hold me close
theres cameras everywhere
an asian band sings strangers in the night as lee tries his best to slow dance
an intimate moment between isabella and lee her face nestled in the crook of his neck hiding her face
whats going on
i need your help
last time you needed my help i ended up in the back of a truck
i had no choice
you have to trust me
lee starts to get into the music moving his hips in a slow sensual rhythm
you move well
just trying to make it look real
look over there
thats the eye in the sky room
lee looks over her shoulder
behind me is the soft count room
were pretty sure the plates are back there
why dont you go get them
if im wrong then my cover is blown
as steven reign makes his way through the casino carter steps right in front of him giving him a big hug
stevie hows it going my man
somebody get a picture we can use it for a mug shot
detective carter you always seem to show up where you dont belong
lemme ask you something steven
and i want the truth
is there any way i can date your daughter
just dinner and a movie maybe go listen to some jazz
vegas has been my town for years
i crawled out from under the first rock
do you really think you can intimidate me here
youre right youre a smart guy
most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar
but this is an even swap
you play games with me detective and youll lose every time
the odds are always in favor of the house
reign walks off with his men
carter watches him leave
lee is dancing close with isabella
the secret service almost busted reign at his casino in macao but the place burned down before we could move in
how do i know i can trust you
lee dips her holds her in his arms for a long beat
im asking for real now will you help the secret service
beat but ill help you
lee holds her for a long beat their lips almost touching
he finally lets her go and she disappears into the crowd
carter walks up sees lee standing alone on the dance floor
lee what the hell are you doing
im out here trying to strong arm steven reign putting my life on the line and youre up here dancing with some bimbo
did she have a friend
it was isabella
she says the plates are in the soft count room
lee motions to the room where we see a security guard standing in front of a small door
are you crazy man
she almost got us killed
shes setting you up again
im going to find out
wait a second
theres guards all over the place
youll need a distraction
carter looks around the casino
ill go to the craps table make a big scene
when security comes over you make your move
try to keep them busy for five minutes
ill give it my best shot
carter walks up to a craps table everyone turning to stare
sir youre aware that we require a fifty thousand dollar buy in to gamble here this weekend
carter throws a hundred thousand in bills onto the table
i saw the sign i can read
now gimme a hundred thousand in chips
and a diet coke and some wash n dries
lets move people i came to play
the dealer pushes k worth of chips in front of carter
what the hell is that
those are five hundred dollar chips
did you give me five hundred dollar chips because im black
no i just assumed
you assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five hundred dollars a roll is that right
are you a racist
starting to scream everyone else at the table has thousand dollar chips but the black man gets the nickel is that it
did my people survive two hundred years of slavery so you could send us back to the cotton fields with five hundred dollar chips
do i look like chicken george to you
the pit boss gets on his walkie talkie
floor security we have a problem at table nine
the security guard lowers his walkie talkie starts moving towards carters table
two security guards approach carters table
answer me one question
how come ben vereen isnt performing here at the hotel
is ben vereen not good enough for you people
lionel ritchie is performing here tonight
lionel ritchie hasnt been black since the commodores
sir youre going to have to calm down
carter watches as lee moves past the guard and makes his way into the soft count room
i have a dream where black people and white people can gamble together without getting different chips
a big crowd has gathered as the security guards try and push their way through
the pit boss picks up the phone calls upstairs
sing with me
we shall overcome
carter starts clapping and the confused crowd joins in as the security guards move in
now in the spirit of brotherhood lets play craps
lee walks into the hallway moving like a cat as he hugs the walls and tries to make his way to the soft count room
he hears noise two security guards coming behind him through the casino door
he has no choice but to crawl over the back of a money cart and hug the top
he lies as still as he can trying not to be seen until he realizes hes staring directly into the eye in the sky cameras that are in the ceiling
as he passes directly under the camera clearly mouthing the words oh shit as he rolls by
lee looks to his left sees the soft count room a mountain of counterfeit superbills that are waiting to be paid out
on the opposite side the real money is being wheeled out toward a waiting truck that is parked at the back door
lee sees two more cameras in the ceiling knows his cover is blown
he jumps down off the cart is standing in front of the locked vault
theres no way to get the plates
isabella has set him up again
he turns and smiles at the confused security guards
hows it going

the guards make their move
and lee starts to fight them down the hall using the cart as a shield as he rams into two more guards fights them off as he turns the corner
toward the casino door but he gets slammed to the ground by a right cross
hu li threw the punch a roll of quarters in her hand as she stands over him with five triad soldiers
she holds a knife to lees throat

she puts the small grenade in lees mouth tapes it shut
she holds the detonator in her hand

carter throws the dice
the table erupts as carter grabs the dice
let it ride
the elevator doors open and lee is led toward the eye in the sky room by hu li and the three triads
as they walk into the room the triads remain outside guarding the room
forty video monitors show every inch of the hotel
a man stands in front of the two way mirror looking down at the casino the reflection off the glass obscuring his features
lee has the tape around his mouth and his hands tied behind his back as hes led into the room by hu li
imagine a business where people hand you money
and you hand them back absolutely nothing
ricky tan alive and well turns around and stares at lee
isabella is standing next to him
lee is shocked at the sight of ricky tan alive
now thats a true american dream
thanks to a few pieces of metal and a very greed driven us customs agent
ricky tan walks toward lee starts to smile
look at you youre ridiculous
you know it didnt have to be like this
but its too bad
like father like son
lee stares at isabella for a beat
hu li motions to one of the monitors
in chinese hes going for the plates
ricky tan looks at one of the monitors sees steven reign walking down a hallway about to walk into the penthouse look at this old fool what does he think
ricky tan shifts his attention back to lee
its almost impossible to find a partner thats trustworthy and loyal
wouldnt you agree lee
we see carter at the craps table having the time of his life
ricky tan turns to walk out of the room motioning to isabella as he goes
well at least you will die with honor
but choy gien
subtitles wont see you again
carter has two racks of chips in front of him a huge crowd surrounding him
im up a hundred and fifty grand

somebody cash me out
several triad soldiers dressed like security guards approach carters table
sir wed like to escort you to the cashier

as they walk toward the door marked vip room carter glances at the men knows hes in deep shit
ricky tan turns to hu li
chai hu li

ricky tan walks out
hu li holds the detonator up to lee plays with the button
in chinese in a few minutes
youll beg me to push this button
hu li pulls her knife moves towards lee
she holds the blade to his face
about to cut him
when isabella pulls her gun
isabella walks toward lee whose hands are still tied behind his back
hu li clutches the detonator in one hand her knife in the other
she takes a step toward isabella
its time to end this inspector
isabella cocks the gun spins back and kicks the detonator from hu lis hand slamming her against the wall and sticking the gun under her chin
united states secret service
hu li whips her knife around catches isabella across the hand the gun sliding across the room near the detonator the two women fight around it
lee watches them almost step on it dives to the floor and rolls toward the detonator
hes about to grab it when theyre about to move in
get the detonator
the triads go for the detonator as lee gets to his feet kicks hu lis legs out from under her
one of the triads about to pick up the detonator but lee gets to him first
he fights with one hand tied behind his back
hu li and isabella fight it out in the eye in the sky room
lee gets kicked towards the eye in the sky window
two security guards lead carter away from the table when an airborne lee rockets through the eye in the sky window
in a rain of glass he lands hard on the casino floor
the noise grabs everyones attention including lee
the guards restrain him
lemme ask you something
any of you ever felt before
he slams the rack of chips across their faces chips flying as the guards hit the floor
doesnt feel so good does it
hu li picks up the detonator
a heeled foot kicks it from her grasp
isabella has recovered
the detonator flies on his back lee watches the detonator sail over his head and disappear into the crowd
it lands on a drink cart
before lee can get there a waitress changes trays and carries the detonator on her rounds
panicked lee searches for the detonator
he jumps atop a blackjack table to get a better vantage
he cant see it but he does see carter on top of a craps table keeping security guards at bay with a croupier stick
black man gets on a hot streak and youre all trippin
carter and lee see each other
they have the same simultaneous though help
carter is lees only hope to get the bomb out of his mouth
but from here to there a mass of people
the quickest way is the high way
lee leaps from table to table
scattering playing cards
reaching the carpeted divide
lee doesnt stop
he launches off the bent over back of a high roller landing on a rickshaw surfing it to the tables on the other side
carter looks around for lee catches a glimpse of the eye in the sky room
check it out
he socks a guard in the face
isabella and hu li are locked in battle
rolling to the floor they both see the gun
they scramble over each other to get to it first
a security guard climbs on the table to level carter when lee arrives
he kicks the guard off and turns to carter his plea muffled
what the hell are you doing with tape on your face
no time to explain two more security guards arrive
kicks and punches fly but lee cant get hit in the mouth
he bobs and weaves holding his hands to carter to untie them in between swings
gunshots from the eye in the sky room
everyone hits the deck
carter and lee dive on to the floor as panic ripples through the casino
people flee for the the waitress deserts her tray
it gets knocked over and tips on the floor
the detonator lands feet away from carter
this cant be good
lees eyes bug he sees it too feet stampeding past it
a high heel misses it by a fraction of an inch
he lunges for it manages to cradle it in his taped hands when wham
he is bumped and it flies away
the second it hits the floor it is kicked skittering down the red carpet
the victor emerges in the eye in the sky room
hu li steps out on the pagoda roof and jumps down
the detonator rolls right past hu li
as she bends to pick up the detonator lee knows he wont get there in time
horrified he screams at carter through the tape
hu li lifts the detonator
carter finally pulls the tape off lees face
lee spits the grenade into the air
diving on carter bomb
hu li hits the trigger just as it lands on a roulette table
the table is blown off its foundation
chips and cash volcano
hu li is blown backwards by the force of the blast
sheer pandemonium grips the casino
carter and lee peer out from behind a row of slot machines
the place is deserted
why didnt you tell me you had a bomb in your mouth
no you didnt
yes i did
i said mmmmmm
a hand on carters arm
this is serious
ricky tan is alive
we have to get to the penthouse
lee jumps up sprints toward the elevators at the dragon end of the casino
carter stuffs his pockets with chips then races after lee
but halfway up the carpet
lee turns to see what is holding him up
hu li survived the blast and carter has turned to face her
you go after ricky
i got this
lee turns and runs off past the dragon
unfortunately five triads block his path
in a flurry of punches lee makes short work of them and races toward the elevators
each readying in their own manner
hu li carefully wraps her long hair into a bun on top of her head
carter stretches flexes ready to sting like a bee
im not gonna hold you back this time just because youre a woman
im gonna pretend youre a man
she pulls off her jacket prepares to fight him in her undershirt
a very beautiful man with a perfect body who id like to take to the movies
she takes a sword from a terra cotta statue swings it around like a master
i may have been absent the day we went over this in karate class
quick carter reaches for a fighting stick off a terra cotta soldier
she slices it in half
carter reaches for another
shes toying with him
lees in the elevator as the doors close
suddenly a hand cuts through parting the doors
a wound on her shoulder
are you okay
she steps in too weak and starts to fall
lee grabs her and holds her in his arms
he gently helps her down
i didnt know which side you were on
now you know
the elevator doors open
isabella holds up a room key the key to the suite
lee takes the key backs away and steps into the elevator
ill try to get backup
the elevator doors close
steven reign is closing the safe
there are stacks of hundred dollar bills on his desk which hes putting in a black bag along with the plates
as he turns around he comes face to face with ricky tan
americans love to gamble
dont they mr
im cutting our deal short
and my plates
they stay with me
im sure you wont have a problem with that
reign shows tan the gun in his belt
grabs the bag and starts to walk toward the door
i enjoyed that little story you told about the dragon and the treasure
my mother used to tell it to me all the time
do you know the moral of that story mr
greed will imprison us all
tan grabs reign from behind and stabs him with a knife
i hate that fortune cookie shit
lee bursts through the suite door watches as reign falls dead to the floor
ricky takes the black bag off the desk
put the plates down
ricky tan looks down at the gun in reigns belt
another terra cotta fighting stick is in half in carters hands
will you stop
picks up cocktail umbrella what am i supposed to fight you with
no more toying
hu li charges carter who grabs a roulette wheel as a makeshift shield
she slices it in half
hes got nowhere to hide
she jabs him with the sword
falls back against the table clutching his chest
hu li windmills kicking a terra cotta soldier on top of carter but the double bladed bamboo pole in its hand ricochets back and she is pierced through the shoulder
with the blade
staring at carter in stunned disbelief she drops to her knees
carter walks toward her considers his options then kicks her in the head knocking her out
when are you people gonna learn
dont mess with the brothas
weak in the knees carter looks to the sound on his chest
he reaches through the slice in his jacket
instead of a hand covered in blood it comes out with a thick wad of cash
thank you benjamin
carter runs for the elevator
lee is walking toward ricky tan the two men circling reigns body
youre just like your father lee
all these years hiding behind his badge
i wanted to help him to share with him but he was too afraid of change
when you think about it i didnt really kill him
i just put him out of his misery
put the plates down
i dont think its over
there are casinos all over this country
let me make you a rich man lee
dont make the same mistake he did
ricky glances at the gun in reigns belt
if you reach for that gun im going to kill you
dont you remember
im already dead
ricky makes a play for the gun but lee is much too fast taking the gun and pushing ricky against the wall just as carter bursts in the room
hey ricky hows it going man
whats up lee
lee has the gun pressed to tans head
weve never seen him like this before
would you like me to tell you how your father died
lee you okay
lee doesnt respond
he keeps an eye on ricky
he never begged for his life
or tried to make a deal
all that he asked me just seconds before i pulled the trigger was that i promise not to kill you
lees finger is on the trigger he wants to pull the trigger but cant
lee wait a second
its not worth it man
hes making you do this
its worth it to me
do you have it in you lee
or are you gonna spend the rest of your life hiding like your father
hes going to jail
you won now just put the gun down
lee is trying to pull the trigger but he cant
thats what i thought
tan takes the black bag and swings it toward lee the plates hit him across the face and knock him down
tan reaches for it and is about to pull the trigger when lee and carter come flying at him together
both kicking him tan falls back smashing through the window
lee tries to grab tans hand their fingers touch for a split second
but tan pulls his hand away and falls stories to the street below
a taxi is parked out front
tans body slams on the roof
lee and carter are looking down at the street both relieved its finally over
carter puts his hand on lees shoulder
i dont know about you but i need a wine cooler
as they turn to the door hu li is walking toward them bleeding and half dead
she has another bomb in her hand
this one twice the size of the one from earlier
in chinese well go together inspector
please tell me she just asked for a ride to the airport
hu li hits the switch starts to smile
lee and carter turn and run for the open window
lee and carter dive out the window grab a cable just as the the fireball shoots out as they start to slide down the side of the hotel
lee and carter swing toward a huge grand opening banner
they flip under it do a loop before they slam against the its knocked loose and they fall with it toward vegas blvd
lee and carter hang on as they drop to the street
a huge truck speeds toward them as they hold on for their lives
the entire strip speeding toward them
i cant believe i flew ten thousand miles for this shit
they lift their feet just as the truck passes
the sign dips and they fall straight down into the open sunroof of a large lee and carter land in the back
slam into their seats and try to catch their breath
the two men starting to laugh when they realize theyre alive
we made it man
lee and carter look up to see the versace salesman and four of his friends sitting in the back of the limo staring at them
the boys are all drinking champagne and dressed for a night on the town
well there is a god after all
lee and carter exchange looks as the limo stops in front of the hotel
here we are
the red dragon hotel
in front of the hotel we see fire trucks ambulance police cars and isabella and sterling arresting twenty triads
were all going gambling and then to see siegried and roy
i hope you two are feeling lucky
lee is talking with a bandaged isabella who is standing with sterling and several other secret service agents
lee and isabella hug goodbye
as she walks off to board her plane lee slowly walks back to carter who is smiling
i saw that
she kissed you didnt she
you played it cool though
walking away never looking back
shes going home to new york
i need some ice
lee and carter watch as she gets on the plane
that your gate down there
im this way
i guess this is goodbye
i guess so
thank you carter
you take care of yourself lee
carter steps back bows to lee
lee shakes carters hand like a brother
the two men smile
turn to walk away
theres something i want you to have
lee pulls a badge from his pocket
hands it to carter
your fathers badge
no way man
i cant take this
i can finally let it go
carter takes the badge
in that case i got something for you
i picked it up at the hotel
carter pulls out a wad of cash
what is this
about fifty grand
i won it at the tables
i cant take this
its okay i got lots more
carter pulls out another wad of cash
they owe us man
thats the least they can do
this money is evidence
come on lee
stop being a cop for five minutes and live it up
there must be something you want
lee looks back toward isabella
i always wanted to go to madison square garden
see the knicks play
new york city
the plaza hotel
a little mu shu
some kung pao
they look at each other smile
i could use a little vacation
amen to that brother
as lee and carter start to walk away together the music swells
war starts to play
they dance their way through a crowd of people their arms raised as the two friends make their way through the airport
