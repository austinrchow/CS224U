b if window
href b b life as a house by mark andrus a clock alarm sounds over titles on black
we hear someone clearing congested lungs coughing up phlegm a slight crash stops both the cough and the alarm
the cottage is a tiny peeling paint rat trap set dead center on a small ocean front cul de sac surrounded by four massive post modern mansions
george nelson squints and shivers as the spotty morning light and ocean breeze enter through an open window
bold waves crash against the cliffs outside the room
a five foot wide stack of hand hewed beams are piled pyramid style making movement in the room next to impossible
george stands shirtless in underwear and coughs again
he steps over a pile of tools and stands at the window facing the sea
a happy sounding tune by guster what you wish for begins with the lyrics woke up today to everything gray and all that i saw just keeps going on and
the post modern house is three levels of concrete and glass
sam is sixteen with spiky black hair a nose ring two earrings and painted black nails
the song continues with
sweep all the pieces under the bed close all the curtains and cover my head
sam looks wasted as he climbs out of bed and rummages through his dresser retrieving an empty bottle of prescription drugs he tosses the bottle
he walks to a desk where a half built model of a house sits unfinished and squeezes glue into a plastic bag and sniffs it
sam enters the closet and digs into a pile of dirty clothes pulling out the tie to a robe he knots it around the closet pole and then twists it
once to form a noose
he slips his neck through the noose and lowers his body though we dont see exactly what hes doing below his neck its evident through his jerking arm that hes
colleen beck georges next door neighbor is a well maintained blonde in her late thirties
she walks out of the angular concrete mansion grabs the paper and walks back in
this is a minimalist kitchen with pored concrete walls and stainless steel cabinets
colleen drops the paper on the table and walks to the sink to wash her hands
the song continues
if this serenade is not what you want its just how it is
colleen appears distracted for a moment
she walks outside onto the terrace with wet hands then bolts back in breezing through the kitchen with purpose
alyssa is sixteen and perfect with strawberry blonde hair and white teeth her head is partially out the bathroom window
colleen bursts in eases alyssa aside and with effort sticks her head out of the same high open window
this is ridiculous
we must not see exactly what they see but out the window and almost beyond view a stream of urine arks out from george nelsons beach house bedroom into the
pacific ocean some twenty feet below
the piss stops
colleen bangs her head trying to get it back inside the house
robin webber is georges ex wife still beautiful at forty
she herds two boys ryan and adam down the hall
run downstairs and give your dad a hug
hell be gone for his birthday
can we have a party for him while hes gone
robin stops and knocks on a bedroom door
i hope youre showered and ready for school
a loud crash stops ryan and adam at the top of the stairs
robin rushes in and glances around the room for her son
the closet pole and a long line of clothes have been felled by sams dangerous whack off technique hes on the floor with the robe tie still around his neck
and a pile of shirts sprawled over him
the song continues
come out come out wherever you are would you do it all over right from the start and what you wish for wont come true you arent surprised to love
robin stops at the door trying to figure out why her son is sitting in a pile of his own clothes
ryan and adam join her looking equally perplexed
georges dog guster is doing his business on the lawn of a modern day robber baron david dokos who exits his house with a briefcase
he hops into his mercedes and proceeds to chase guster straight across his well manicured grass
guster easily escapes death and runs off
george walks out of his shack as david hops the curb flips him off and drives away
george waves goodbye
stick it up your ass
have a nice day
glancing around guster
guster runs to his side as colleen rushes out of her house
this has got to stop
hes going back in
does it give you some sort of perverse pleasure to expose your
penis in plain view of my sixteen year old daughter
there are no windows facing my
george this is the third time
the plumbers due out on friday
youll have to explain that to the police
you were the only neighbor i could tolerate
i did warn you
my life is a warning
i just cant figure out for what
colleen shies away from georges stare he finally turns and walks toward the house but stops short as he turns back
colleen how hard was it for you to get your head outside that window far enough to see my dick
this stops colleen for a moment it was difficult
george walks back to the cottage and locks guster in before stepping into an old ford truck and driving off
colleen watches him drive off then turns to her house and stares
peter webber robins husband is a distinguished intimidating man with silver hair and an expensive suit
lois the maid serves french toast to ryan and adam as robin sips tea
sam broke his closet
peter glances at robin who shrugs
i dont have a clue anymore
i wish youd talk to him
he needs a man
his father is a man
a man he respects
sam walks into the room from the hall outfitted in all black with kick ass boots
thanks for talking about me behind my back
useful in court
are you wearing eye shadow
adam ryan and robin check out the eye shadow
take it off
sam flutters his eyelids in defiance of his stepfather
do it now
if i walk out the door whos gonna be here tonight for the follow through
peter hesitates for just a second
have a nice flight
sams out the door with his eye shadow intact
what did you say
dad said it first
robin focuses on peter who simply shrugs
adam stands up walks over to his father and gives him a hug
i get chocolate cake for your birthday
are your hands clean
adam is quick to back away from his father and lick the fingers of one hand
george is resting his head against the glass window as he stares out at the blighted landscape leading to downtown los angeles
a sudden pang tightens his face he presses his hand against his stomach and closes his eyes
sam is alone at the back of the parking lot sitting on the hood of an old saab smoking as two boys josh and marek both seventeen park a porsche
and pull alyssa beck georges peeping neighbor and another girl out of the backseat
dude nice look
sam simply nods as marek and the other girl laugh at his all black garb earrings and eye shadow
i saw your dad this morning
sam drops his cigarette and stomps it out as he stands his face lightens as alyssa waves before walking away
two hours a week for three hundred cash
the whole summer
do the math
as a dig they consider that a hatchback or a station wagon
oh that isnt yours anyway is it
josh raises his eyebrows and smiles before walking away
sam faces the saab and kicks the bumper as hard as he can
suddenly a boy corey bolts up from the back seat
i was in total rem man
the architectural firm of benson and feinsilber occupies the entire fortieth floor george nelson is their sole model maker
rather than offices most of the space is open segmented only by portable low walls
along the outer walls below the long line of windows is a shelf filled with amazingly intricate models
george is alone in a cubicle of his own cutting polystyrene with a hot wire
steven gardner rounds a corner with a velocity that makes george flinch
close to done
im doing the grass
fuck the grass
who said grass
steven exits as quickly as he entered but as soon as george goes back to work steven pops his head back in
burke bided out the berlin plaza
did he tell you
i was going to start monday
he likes the look of the computer models anyway
you take too long
beat after you mow the grass would you mind bringing the house to my office
i have a presentation to make
george simply stares as steven nods and leaves
sam is by himself his eyes closed listening to music through headphones as alyssa stops to stare she visually scans him head to foot appearing slightly perplexed as a friend
i wouldnt make a habit of it
the friend walks on after a beat alyssa does too
in the distance the sun colors the sky a blinding orange as it sets
a range rover with blackened windows is parked behind a porsche
tinted windows an up tempo tune with a hand clapping by the pansy division begins a bed would be a treat but all weve got is this backseat tinted windows
are a beautiful thing
through the front windshield we can see marek sitting in the passengers seat with his eyes closed
josh mareks friend is sitting on a bench in the park behind the cars
a dark secluded spot in a deserted parking lot tinted windows are a wonderful thing
suddenly the passenger door on the rover opens and marek climbs out brushing his hair with his hands before casually checking his zipper
he closes the door and the car speeds away
josh walks to marek and wordlessly they climb into the porsche and drive off
george is shirtless in his front yard hand hewing a twenty foot beam
one strong long pull and a thin shaving flutters to the ground guster nabs it and starts to chew
youll crap real logs if you keep eating wood
guster appears unconcerned as he awaits a new shaving
george glances up wipes the sweat from his forehead as alyssa walks toward him in white shorts and a tee shirt
sorry i got you into trouble
george goes back to works and guster taste tests shavings as alyssa searches for something else to say
does sam have any friends
george stops and looks up he has no idea how to answer
he seems lonely
are you his friend
and i guess hes into guys
i hate nose rings
and the blue eye shadow thing really isnt working
george is totally confused unsure most of the answer but before he can question her a police car pulls to a stop officer kurt walker steps out
thought id run over the list
officer walker removes a pad from his pocket and flips through to find his place
this is such a street of whiners
from tuesday to yesterday not including monday or today
dokos is repeatedly running over her lawn
the corliss have attributed the increase in rat population in their environs to the state of your
ipos caused the rat population on this street
officer walker focuses on alyssa
and of course the becks with the
it could have been a squirt gun
to george youve been good this week
you forgot david dokos and tom and barbara
kurt stuffs his pad back into his pocket
dokos calls animal control for guster and i was out here on the other
pointing to the plane do you mind
george hands him the plane and kurt begins to work the wood
are you guys friends
weve known each other since grade school
i mean but did you both go camping on weekends
listen to music
talk on the phone
george doesnt answer and kurt keeps working
hunted rabbit in the hills
alyssa stares at george disappointed
i aimed high
we just werent very much alike i guess
i dont know
casually to george i liked your dad more than i liked you
i wouldnt want you as a friend
george just never really
aimed that high
even with not hitting a rabbit
i knew you were doing that by the way
thats why i stopped doing it with you
you were no fun
it was always like you were frightened
quiet and boring
kurt is beginning to perspire as he shaves food off the beam for guster
funny how hes the architect and youre just a loud mouth cop
he builds models for architects
his dad on the other hand was the real deal
designed and built the coolest houses ive ever seen
was bankrupt and dead before i was twenty
left you this place
it was in my name so he wouldnt lose it
he stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title
do you know what id give to have this
forget how i got it
i cant afford dirt in this town
i live in riverside goddammitt and you get to piss in the ocean
kurt stops working and steps back
your kid was down around divers cover again smoking pot
i didnt write him up
told him i wouldnt tell you
thanks for telling me
at least your father tried george
kurt walks to his car and drives off
theres a moment of awkwardness with alyssa
george walks into his house leaving alyssa with guster
robin is sitting at the kitchen counter cutting carrots through the french doors shes able to watch ryan and adam along with a few friends play in the pool
i could be anyone
robin jerks with fright as half the carrots roll to the floor
then why do you stay you
george picks up the carrots and washes them in the sink
you should lock your doors
ring the bell before you try the door
george bites into a carrot as robin starts chopping again
did sam call to tell you he wouldnt be over this weekend
you let him pierce his nose
robin snatches the carrot from georges hand and chops it up
lock the door behind you
where is he
where he always is
george takes robins hand and removes the knife
not that i dont trust you
as george lets go robin holds on he appears surprised by her grip of his wrist
robins eyes well with tears
i should have knocked
george is clearly not comfortable with his ex wifes hold of him with her tears
what kind of a mother cant stand her son
george jerks his arm away from her grip
i dont know
george is tense and he walks to sams door and knocks
why arent you coming in for the weekend
george tries the door its locked
frustrated he walks back down the hall and down the stairs
outside the boys are engaged in a raucous version of marco polo
robin is at the sink she holds her hair back with one hand and splashes water on her face with the other
george walks by outside carrying a ladder
ryan is the first to notice george
what are you doing
im not cheating
im not looking
robin wipes her face with a hand towel as she rushes out
what are you doing
he doesnt answer
the boys have stopped playing adam opens his eyes
he never answers
why does he have a lock on his door
because he put the lock on
do you think i told him he could have a nose ring
why do you ask me everything you should ask him
i dont know anything anymore
the boys line up against the edge of the pool and watch george extend the ladder against the house and climb
you climb up there and tell him what he can and cant do
take him for the summer okay
whip him into shape
cut his hair
make him smile
let him hate you for a while
sadly youre too late for heroics george
george lops a leg over the railing and steps onto the bedroom balcony
he peers into the room through the sliding glass door and tries to open it locked before removing the screen to the small open window beside it
he climbs in
sam is asleep on his bed in his underwear wearing headphones
on the floor is an aerosol can of whipping cream
george picks up the can and tosses it in the trash
he focuses back on his son with his nose ring earrings blue eyeshadow and thin pale white body
sam is soundly asleep
george gently removes the headphones from his sons head drum heavy music surges from the small padded speakers
you need every brain cell youve got
a knock on the door stirs sam more than his fathers voice
half asleep leave me alone
sams eyes are still closed as he shifts onto his side
george opens the door robin is weak and weepy
i dont know what to do anymore
you take him
hostile youre such a good father
george walks out of the room around robin and down the stairs without a word
sam stirs at the sound and sits up to confront his mother
what are you doing in my room
i didnt go in your room
i locked the door
i locked the door
robin grabs the door and closes it quickly but doesnt move
i locked the door
i dont sneak around your room
sam rushes over to the window and stares down at the screen and ladder
ryan adam and their friends are still in the pool holding onto the coping staring up at sam
sam slams the window shut and searches for the can of whipping cream
he gets down on his knees to search under the bed
standing and making one more pass of the room he notices the can in the trash
he instantly focuses all his rage at the closed door
this is my room
you have no right in here
this is mine
robin is sitting on the floor at the top of the stairs staring blankly down at the foyer of this modernist mansion
why cant you all just die and leave me alone
the traffic is thick and loud and the sky is a blanket of brown as george makes his way down a sidewalk mixed with professionals and panhandlers
suddenly sick george rushes to the side of a building and vomits
george wipes a clump of wet paper towel against the vomit stain on his cuff as he walks through the pockets of cubicles to a large enclosed office
a secretary smiles as she stands up from her desk and opens the door
is there a
he holds out the wad of wet paper towels but before he can say trashcan bryan burke stands up from behind his desk
george have a seat
ive got juice
george steps in and the secretary closes the door to the office
bryan approaches with his arm outstretched but george can only raise the paper towels
a bird caught me
bryan grabs a trashcan and holds it up george tosses the ball into the trash and sits down
bryan motions with his hand as he sits
im good thanks
what are you on
how much weight have you lost
i just havent been very hungry
hows your wife
when we divorce a decade ago she was very very angry
beat now shes just hostile
bryan nods and laughs as he takes a chunk of croissant and chews as he talks
what was he
he buys and sells the world
quite the spotlight on that guy
i did tell you didnt i
that id be ready to start the berlin model today
well thats sort of
youre sure youre not hungry
bryan is anxious as he holds up the rest of the croissant
george shakes his head no
bryan tosses his croissant into the trash can and leans forward
this isnt me
beat we can show clients endless options change anything in a matter of hours on the computer
but you wont change
typing and clicking myself to renderings isnt why i started building models
all of us are typing and clicking george
whether we want to or not
which is why we bid out a quarter of our projects
it doesnt make a lot of sense anymore to want what we dont have and dont want what we do
george glances around the office angered by the thought hes being fired
ive been here twenty years
maybe thats too long
thats too long
george nods as he stares at bryan
listen they decided on a week a year severance but i got them to twenty six
thats six months salary george
medical and everything for six months
you can learn all you need to on the computer long before that
maybe find a job closer to home
bryan is rattled by georges blank stare
he takes his glass of orange juice and sits back in his chair taking a sip all the while keeping an eye on george
my wife left me because i wasnt
i kept trying to explain that my father sucked all the emotion from me
drunks do that sometimes
make their kids afraid
make them unwilling to express themselves
bryan knows hes supposed to say something he just cant seem to figure out what
how old are you
we were probably in school together
you went to berkley
bryan lights up at the sound of his alma matter
class of eighty six
i didnt know you were there
i was a sophomore when i got the call my parents were dead
this is not the direction bryan had hoped the conversation was headed
my dad had a blood alcohol level of
a little high
drove right into oncoming traffic
killed my mother with him
a lady in another car
hurt her daughter
a five year old girl
i think about her still
bryan wants this to end
he leans forward with a whisper
maybe i can get you a year
i hate this job
what are you talking about
you love your job
from the day i started
cant stand it
bryan is perplexed as george stands
then it sounds like im doing you a favor
it may sound that way but i react out of fear
my life has nothing to do with what i like or dont like
you havent been listening have you
i didnt know there would be a quiz george
well i feel better about this now
i was hoping for that
relieved and not understanding anything about irony bryan stands and extends his hand
george shakes bryans hand without malice
ive got one favor to ask
what can i do for you george
i built my first model here when i was twenty
there are hundreds of them on shelves around the office
twenty years of my life
i was wondering if i might be able to pick a few to keep to take home
only the ones that really mean something to me
bryan recoils slightly from the request
i mean we dont get to keep our work
i could maybe ask them if you could choose one
but you know frankly george you were the best
computer models cant begin to match the beauty you gave yours
theyre a part of this firm
they inspire me
i go out there and sometimes just stare at something ive designed
it amazes me
i would miss that too much
beat look i may be going out on a limb but you go out there and look them over every single one of them and pick the one you like
the best and take it with you
just run it by me first just in case you know
but im sure itll be okay
well its the least i can do
yes it is
george nods and leaves
bryan looks lost and guilty again
george walks around the maze of cubicles back to his own
he finds an empty box and starts to pack
against a wall a large rack is filled with spools of architectural plans
george pulls one of the plans down rolls it out and detaches the wooden spool
without warning and with a fury hard to fathom he proceeds to bat and smash a shelf of beautifully rendered models
heads pop up in other cubicles as george walks out of his own and armed with a frightening rage methodically attacks model after model resting on shelves just below massive
plate glass windows that frame downtown los angeles
steven gardner who asked for his model without grass rushes to within feet of george as he witness his creation deconstruct into shards of cardboard and plastic
mother of god
not my house
george stops for a second to focus on steven but steven is smart enough to run
george continues on with the business of disassembling his work
oh please please no
the plea is instantly followed by a pathetic low whine
george works up a sweat as he whacks model after model portions of plastic walls or window splatter the office as though bombed in war
bryan burkes secretary inches as close as she dares
burke would like a word with you george
george lowers his stick as he faces her
in his office
when youre able
with that george finishes what he began only minutes prior the complete and utter destruction of every model displayed on every shelf in the office save one
workers huddle together collectively moaning and moving en mass from the mayhem
george picks up the sole surviving model in his arms and cradles it carefully as he walks into bryan burkes office
bryan cowers behind his desk as george enters with his model in one hand and the long wooden stick in the other
ill take this one if thats okay
it takes bryan a few aborted attempts to answer before he simply nods
thank you for going out on a limb and allowing me one
bryan nods again then quivers as george steps forward leans the stick against the desk and extends his hand
youre a great architect and a miserable human being
bryan winces as he extends his hand
they shake hands and george grabs hold of the stick again
george walks around the desk and bashes in a model hidden on the floor one that bryan had obviously wanted to save
george drops the wooden spool and walks out of the office as bryan garners the courage to stand
youre not even an architect and youre a miserable human being
george turns around only long enough to answer
george closes the door behind him
bryan stares down at the remains of the model he gets down on his knees and carefully gathers up the pieces
george is sweating as he walks with his box of personal items under one arm and the model under the other
dizzy he stops for a moment and tires to orient himself glancing one way then the other before staggering back and pressing himself against the building for support
sweat beads and drops from his nose and chin as the song across the universe begins by the beatles
george sets the box down but clings tightly to the model as he closes his eyes
pools of sorrow waves of joy are drifting through my open mind possessing them caressing me
george drops face first to the cement crushing the model beneath him
george is probed and poked by doctor after doctor
an ultrasound test followed by a ct scan followed by a mri results in more tests
a flexible tube is slid down georges throat as dye is shot into his body
sounds of laughter shades of life are ringing through my open view inciting them inviting me
a long blunt needle is shoved into georges side for a biopsy of his pancreas
x rays are lit and highlighted as doctors ponder the specks the disease
finally george is opened up nearly bloodless slice through skin muscle and fat reveals death
limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns which calls me on and on across the universe
george is wheeled down a long hall to the critical care unit
nothings going to change my world nothings gonna change my world
george tries to sit up but falls back as he closes his eyes opens his eyes closes his eyes
that took care of the pain
george opens his eyes again as an attractive nurse enters with a tray of food
i could kiss you
the nurse smiles as she lifts the cover off the dinner
she raises georges bed
what would you do if you had three or four months to live
the nurse glances over at the other patient in the room whos sleeping before answering in a soft voice
id eat a lot of red meat
good for you
the nurse smiles as she sits down beside the bed
she fills a spoon with corn and aims it for georges mouth he accepts the good will chews and swallows
what would you do
id build a house
george takes another spoonful of food
what kind of house
you know what mortise and tenon is
the nurse shakes her head no
ive got every part of it ready
its like a jig saw puzzle
all in pieces now just waiting to make sense
ive been through design and review
the planning commission city council
she feeds george another small spoonful of food
no ones really said four months is all you have have they
stage four pancreatic cancer
they havent even pretended to offer treatment
you tell me when would you start eating red meat
can you build a house in four months
i can die trying
the nurse rests her hand for a moment on georges cheek
good for you
i havent been touched in years
suddenly alarmed by her emotion the nurse removes her hand and stands back away from george
im sorry i dont know what that was
a handshake or you know someone pats you on your back through clothes
doctors people who have to touch you
but not by people who want to
everybody gets touched by someone they love
isnt that weird
i mean i dated a little bit after my divorce for four or five years
i know when my son was younger
maybe when he was ten or eleven even hed run up and wrap his arms around me
george suddenly stops to catch his emotion
the nurse checks the door before walking back to george she brushes back his hair with both hands then fingers the curves of his ears finally resting her thumbs on
oh god im married
feeling guilty she flees the room waking the other patient
george is resting eyes closed sitting on a bench with his box and the remnants of the model beside him
a black range rover pulls to a stop with a honk
george stands to gather his things as robin steps out of the car yelling
i called everyone everywhere
you just vanished
you could be dead
thanks for waking me up
picking me up
youre loud today
youre inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion
youre the most beautiful woman i have ever known in my life
robin is stumped for a second confused by the words
im not talking just physically
even your anger is perfect
robin climbs back in the car and slams her door shut
george sets his box in back and climbs into the front seat as robin takes off
he closes his door as she runs a stoplight
i didnt think youd know i went missing
you didnt think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat
a blueprint spool
where have you been for a week
i left to think
what did you do with your dog
kurts been feeding him
but you cant call me while you think
i wasnt thinking
look im sorry i didnt think to call you while i thought
george raises his eyebrows wanting just the slightest give from robin
she glances at him but wont yield
i need to talk to you
why would they tow your truck
i was parked in day parking
why call me
im going to tear down the shack and build my house
youve been saying that for twenty years
while we were dating you said it
theres nothing anymore to stop me
and im going to cash in my life insurance policy
how many years did i live with your beams and boards
first in the garage then in the living room
were going to do it robin
salvaged floorboards from a house in pasadena
doors from a church in new hampshire
i love those doors
where will you live
look i wasnt serious about you taking sam so you dont have to get into any actual construction to get out of it
whens school over
god i hate the thought of him home all day
ill be by saturday to pick him up
he doesnt want to spend the weekends with you anymore
not for the weekend
for the summer
you and sam are going to live in a garage without plumbing for the summer
the garage is plumbed
ill put in a toilet
thank you for at least sounding sincere
i need help
hes cheap labor
one of you would end up dead
at least well have a house to show for it
forget it really
i want him with me
no you dont
george rests a hand on the back of her neck
i want sam for the summer
robin furrows her brow for a moment and glances at george
it takes a while for her to answer
george rests his hand on robins cheek for a moment as the nurse had done with him
robin turns her head and bites his finger
george nods as he mock nurses his finger
sam is walking with corey whos wiry and wan with a red nose
the whole summer man
party in tahoe
i dont know
itll just be my brother the dweeb on weekends
all we gotta do is sand and paint the cabin dude
boasting my dads gonna let me use the boat and my charm is gonna let me use my rod
income village is the place to hook up with hump
hey it beats letting town folk go down on you for the summer
sam stops which stops corey
sam glances around to make sure no ones listening
i never said anything
i havent done anything
i know what the deal is
josh is a pimp
im not stupid
you dont know what the deal is
there is no fucking deal
sam walks away pissed that corey knows what the deal is
george is shirtless the stitches still fresh on his side he carries drags his mattress into the garage
alyssa walks from her house to the garage and peeks in
george is making his bed which is not easy because guster is curled up on it
the one car garage is not dry walled and the cement floor is clean but stained
george steps away from the bed slightly rattled by alyssa
why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage
im living here while i build another house
is that legal
alyssa sits down on the bed beside guster and starts to bounce up and down
george takes another step back
dont you have school
alyssa lies down on the bed lifting the sheet to her nose
are these clean
george is alarmed
guster licks alyssas ear
george bangs his head with his hand and starts to search the room
alyssa reaches out and slides a finger down his scar
i cut myself
george pats down his pockets
i had them in my pocket
im not shaving my legs or pits this summer ive decided
george opens the drawers of a small desk and a chest not paying attention to alyssa as she raises her leg and runs her hands down the stubby skin
paula cole isnt a vertical kisser
george dabs his keys from the floor beside the chest
make the bed for me would you
i gotta run
george turns around to alyssas leg up and a great view of her underwear
what are you forty
george whirls around to face colleen as alyssa lowers her leg
i forgot where i put my keys
and you thought they might be under her dress
i was just showing him my hair
alyssa miffed as she stands
i think you need to rethink what you think of me
alyssa walks around her mother and out of the garage
colleen stares at george
her leg hair
colleen turns and walks out
george drives the four miles north to robins house listening to paula cole
he turns into emerald bay a guard gated community and a guard waves him in
george rushes from his car and tries the front door but its locked
he rings the bell and lois the maid answers
webber is in the backyard
in his room packing
sam has a cd by marylin manson on loud as he packs a suitcase on his bed
the knock on the door is barely heard
another knock draws his disapproval
sams face turns sour as he yanks the door open
sam shrugs and returns to finish his packing
i think youll have fun this summer
its nearly impossible to hear george over the music
dont forget your headphones
the music is quickly driving george crazy
would you mind turning it down
this doesnt register with sam
it wont all be work you know
george is once again seemingly unheard
he walks to within inches of sam and grabs his head and yells into sams ear
it wont be all work you know
sam pulls away from the touch and turns the music off
i heard you already
george walks to the sliding glass door and stares down at the boys and robin in the pool
your mom and the boys can drop by anytime
to check up on me
ill be around to check up on you
why would you be there
because i live there
you live in corys parents cabin
ryan and adam are on their backs on rafts as robin swims laps between them
suddenly like a ufo crashing to earth sams suitcase spirals downward straight into the pool barely missing both adam and ryan
no fucking way
the boys are knocked off their rafts as robin takes off her goggles and focuses on sam up on his balcony
you stupid liar
i hate you
george bursts out of the kitchen onto the patio
did you tell him hes spending the summer with me
no im not
sam storms off the balcony back into his room
what was i supposed to do
when you didnt show up saturday i tried to call
your phone isnt working
i dont have a phone
i drove over and you were gone
i cant leave the house
last time you were gone for a week
did you tell him he was spending the summer with me
i was going to let you do that
hes not spending the summer in tahoe
sam walks out of the kitchen to confront his father
who are you anyway
i dont even know you
youll know me by the time were through
im not going
ill get your bag
george walks to the edge of the pool and scoops up the suitcase holding it out as it drains
mom tell him im not going
you already promised me
you have everything
robin is in an uncomfortable position as she glances at sam before focusing on george
i did say he could go
im not going
you dont have a choice
sams eyes well with tears as his voice cracks
robin is ready to concede
george adamant hes not spending the entire summer with another kid in tahoe
if he leaves i will follow him up there and i will drag him home by his nose ring
he can hate me
you can hate me
he can try to kill me while i sleep
you can call the police
you can call your husband or your attorney but sam is spending the summer with me
hes my son
sam is crying now snots running down his nose
robin is shocked by georges forcefulness
can we hate you
you can do anything you want
george walks to sam and touches his arm
go get in the truck sam
sam jerks away from his dad as dramatically as he can manage
go fuck yourself
george drops the suitcase and grabs sam by the arms
as much as sam tries to resist hes clearly no match for his father
your nose ring comes out of your nose
if youve got them in your nipples they come out too
and theres no make up at my house
no glue sniffing
no pills no grass
if you hit me ill call the police
youve worn out your welcome at this house sam
i wont ever hit you
beat this may well be the worst three months of your life but youve earned it
so pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck
ill hate you forever
you cant even begins to know how much i hate my father
upbeat think of it as a family tradition
sam glares at his mother before grabbing his soggy suitcase and stomping out of the backyard
robin is stunned silent by georges decisiveness
sam is pressed against the passenger side door
george walks from the backyard and opens the truck door to climb in but is stopped by sams suitcase
he lifts it out and sets it in the bed then slides into the cab sitting on the soaked seat
george rises up and turns to sam who is sullen and silent
sam is shirtless on his back on the roof of the shack sunning himself as george struggles to extricate a sofa from a doorjamb
guster is asleep on the grass under a tree
for like three minutes
after another bout of trying george drops the sofa and steps back to glance up at sam
if i break my back daddys gonna buy you a naval ring
no reaction from sam
and if that naval ring dont fit daddys gonna rub you down with the sun screen
sam glances down at his father puzzled by the verse
i want you wearing sun block
and i want you down here to help me
sam dismisses his father without a word he simply adjusts his face back to the sun
george walks away
a sudden spray of water drenches sam forcing him to his feet in a cold panic
george stops the hose water pelting
it works on guster
george is still struggling with the sofa stuck in the door
frustrated he steps away from the sofa
youre in there not helping at all arent you
sam is leaning against a wall with his arms folded across his chest
you know what else helped guster
the slightest alarm crosses sams face
george is shirtless in shorts boiling pasta on a portable stove as he heats a sauce in the microwave
a dresser topped with plyboard serves as a countertop other than a sink being across the garage near the toilet this is a fairly well equipped makeshift kitchen
do you want garlic bread
george waits a bit to make sure no response is no response
then stuffs a hunk of garlic bread into the toaster oven
sam is sitting on the edge of a cliff that drops twenty feet to the ocean guster is whining for attention behind sam
well get over here then stupid
guster inches forward on his belly which makes sam smile
are you afraid of heights guster
sam drops to his belly and stretches out to pet guster
the fall probably wouldnt kill me anyway
guster inches closer and licks sams face
george walks out with a tray filled with spaghetti garlic bread and a coke
thinking of jumping
george sets the tray on the ground beside sam
george walks to the edge of the cliff
only jump after you hear the wave crash against the rock
the water will take you out
swim a little north and youll see the sand
sam sits up and faces his father with a trace of alarm
first time i did it younger than you i thought id break my neck and just sort of float to catalina
beat you dont always get what you wish for sam
george suddenly leaps forward and disappears into the sea as a wave crashes against the rocks below
sam scurries to his feet and scans the ocean for his father the only thing visible is darkness
guster is lapping up the dinner bread and all as sam calls out again
in a bit of a panic sam runs from the cliff
the traffic is heavy as sam runs against it
without a sidewalk and with parked cars blocking a reasonable path this is a dangerous trek north
sam runs to the edge of the water and anxiously waits for his father to emerge from the sea
a jogger startles sam he steps into a wave that soaks his shoes
george floats on a wave into view and stands in waist high water only to be knocked way back down
he rises and falls and rises before making his way to the sand and sam
are you totally insane
i almost saw catalina
george coughs and drops onto the sand exhausted
sam storms off angry that he cared enough to get angry
sam is winded as he walks off the street to the middle of the yard
he glances around for guster
guster bounces out of the garage with spaghetti sauce covering his muzzle
youre so busted dude
sam sits down on the grass and plays with guster who yaps with joy as he breaks away and closes the distance with the abandon of a puppy
wheres my dinner huh
sam manages to pin guster on his back
he looms over the dog as he kisses him on the nose
wheres my dinner
who ate my dinner
whos in trouble now
sam rolls over guster and stands nearly stumbling in the process way uncool
what are you doing here
guster bumps against alyssa for her attention she kneels down to pet him
theyre trying to make me spend the summer here
im leaving in the morning
im supposed to be in tahoe
your dads really gonna build his house
i dont know
well if you dont go i guess ill see you
sam is clearly shy around her
you should stay
i dont know
wheres your dad
he jumped into the ocean
tell him i said hi
alyssa pets guster again before walking away
sam is smitten
sams curled up in a tattered lazy boy near the toilet watching television as george sits on the bed brushing his teeth
suddenly sam turns to face his dad
im not taking a dump with you in here
george nods as he continues brushing
my brothers say its the worst smell theyve ever smelled
george nods again which appears only to irritate sam
i think you have to have a door between where you cook and where you crap
like even in the bush tribal people and like that have a place for both
its like a law
george walks around sam to the sink and spits rinses and wipes his mouth with a towel
he faces sam
which side of the bed do you want
sams jaw drops as he glances at the double bed
the sofas a pullout
george smiles and pats sam on the shoulder before walking to the sofa and pulling it out to make a bed
probably in the bible
george drops his pants and climbs into bed
he pulls the sheet up and fluffs the pillow before resting his head
i have to take a dump
george twists around in bed to face sam
after a beat he tosses the sheet back climbs out of bed pulls back on his pants slips on his shoes and walks out of the garage
george is up on the roof hacking through the shingles and beams with a chain saw
a huge dumpster set on the lawn receives only about half the throws george makes
sam is near the ocean in a chaise lounge listening to music through his portable cd player
have you got sunscreen on
theres no chance hes been heard
tom and barbara two older neighbors of georges nearing home from a walk stop on the driveway both look pleased
its about time this shack is torn down
barbara appears surprised as george turns to face them she obviously didnt realize he was the one up on the roof doing the demolition
oh hello george
guess how many low income apartments the city approved for this lot
tom and barbara react by trying not to react
tom and barbara step back and walk away
george heads to the ladder and climbs down
sam is grooving to the music with his eyes closed as georges hand filled with a gob of sunscreen plops onto sams stomach
sam bolts up from the chaise lounge in a rage
what are you doing
i warned you yesterday
dont touch me
you cant touch me
hey you stayed
alyssa walks across her lawn to the feuding family
george holds out the bottle of sun lotion to alyssa
rub him down please
george walks back to the ladder and up onto the roof as alyssa and sam stare at one another
hes a freak
you look better without make up
i cant even take a shower here
come over to my house whenever you want
ill tell my mom
i might not stay anyway
ill get your back
sam reaches out for the lotion but alyssa hides the bottle
have you ever had anyone but your mom or dad put it on for you
sam thinks about it for a second before shaking his head no
its weird how different it is
george is back with the chain saw hacking away at the roof
sam is hesitant as he lies down on his stomach
alyssa kneels and squeezes lotion on his back
she works it in starting at his neck working her way down to his pants
she squirts sams arm and as she rubs close to his pit he squirms
do you remember me from when you lived here
your dad dated my mom after her divorce
i wanted him to marry her
alyssa grabs under his armpits and tickles him
sam yelps and rises onto his elbows as josh roars by the shack in his porsche
josh and i are going to south coast
maybe see a movie
sam is disappointed as alyssa stands to leave
dont forget your front
alyssa walks to the shack and waves goodbye to george
george waves her off
sam curls onto his side as he watches alyssa run across the lawn to josh
for a girl
sam appears irritated as he stands and walks into the garage
sam glances out the window to check on his father then quickly rummages through every drawer and cabinet looking for what he finds a prescription bottle
he checks on his dad through the window again then opens the bottle and takes out five pills
he fills a glass with water and swallows two saving three for later
he sets the bottle back where he found it before he drops on the bed with a grin
guster is in a full out run for a rubber ball
sam is shirted sitting at the patio table
with the ball gladly returned sam tosses it again
george walks out juggling two plates of sandwiches and two cokes and sits down
do you ever get like the slightest inkling that you might want to help me instead of doing absolutely nothing
get the inkling sam
im getting tired of your attitude
sam picks up the sandwich examines it and sets it back down on the plate
i hate turkey
no you dont
george takes a bite of his sandwich before responding
i want you to take out your nose ring and leave it out
it bugs me
you snore at night
that bugs me
can i take you out
your brothers are right
it was the most god awful smell ive ever had my nose around
george tightens his face and waves his hand in front of his nose
sam stares at his father
a black range rover pulls to a stop and robin steps out with a pizza box in her hands
thought you guys might be hungry
as robin walks up the drive sam picks up the turkey sandwich and starts eating
george glances at sam as robin sets the box on the table and sits down
well for later then
robin focuses on the nearly roofless shack
guster walks to the table and sits down by robin ready to beg
it makes me sad
i used to live here
but you hated four out of the five you did
i was here six years
and i only hated two
the first and the last
george sets his sandwich down
i dont even like turkey sandwiches
what kind of pizza
george opens the box and pulls out a slice
sam appears disinterested as george starts in on the slice of pizza
to sam sure you dont want any
sam shrugs off his mother looking away
robin nods and grabs a piece for herself
youre too thin george
from what you used to be anyway
george responds with a pleasant face hes not going to explain his weight loss right now
why the first and the last
robin sets her slice of pizza down as she studies george
the first because i wasnt sure you really loved me
the last because i wasnt sure i really loved you
though it may appear that sam isnt interested in the conversation his ears are perked
i was up on the roof this morning tearing it down and it struck me as strong as anything ever has
that im happy today
what have you been before today
it was just that maybe the way the sun struck the ocean the sound of the waves
it was simple whatever it was
then i started thinking about the last time i felt this good
beat its been a long time
do you remember
the only time i can think of for sure i was holding onto sam in the ocean saving him from the waves
george turns to sam whos caught staring at his father
you head was pressed against my chest
i could feel your heart racing
and i remember i kissed your hair
we have it on video
was that when
my parents were down for his sixth birthday
i remember that
robin inexplicably starts to cry
she instantly tries to take it back pressing her hand to her mouth wiping her eyes but whatever emotion has her has her good
both george and sam are confused and concerned
i have to go
she stands and backs away from the table
what is it
beat ill drop by your lunch tomorrow
robin wipes her eyes again as she climbs into her car and drives off
sam and george face one another
i dont know
im gonna take a walk
i need some money
youll have money when you work
youre so predictable
sam sets his sandwich down and grabs a slice of pizza as he stands
he walks for a few feet stops and turns around
you havent been happy in ten years
he doesnt wait for an answer as he walks away guster follows
george takes robins slice of pizza and drops it on the cement thats all it takes to turn guster around
robin is sitting alone at the table doing nothing
the tv is on loud in another room
adam walks into the room in his pajamas
he sits down across from his mother at the table
robin smiles at him
he smiles back as he scoots his chair closer to the table and extends his arms straight out across the top
robin extends her arms and they lock hands near the middle
without a word they hold hands
adam lets go and climbs on top of the table scoots across it with a kiss for his mother before hes gone sliding off the table on his rear and
running back to the tv
george is on the patio bending a thin piece of copper tubing
sam storms out of the garage fuming
no one would blame me if i left
id blame you
i want you here
im not doing it
itll be fine
why dont you just beg some money off my dad and move into something decent with a real kitchen and a real bathroom
id rather sell my nuts to a castrati
sam screws his face down huh
i dont beg
and i dont take a shower in the middle of the yard
i can promise you complete privacy
you cant promise me anything
you dont have anything to promise
you live in a garage
you dont have cable
youre not hooked up to the internet because you dont even own a computer
you dont have a job
george finishes bending the copper into a circle
he stands and holds the copper circle out for proof of privacy
this will save you from prying eyes
sam dismisses his father with a shake of his head
he heads back into the garage
sam quickly heads to where georges prescription bottle was hidden under a pile of underwear
he steals two more pills and swallows them before grabbing a towel and walking out
if you had a stupid phone or i could use your truck mom would give me some money
youll have money when you work for it
sam stomps down the driveway and across the grass to alyssas house
george walks around to the back of his garage with the rounded copper tubing
sam is standing on the porch with his towel and clean clothes
colleen answers the door
is alyssa home
shes out with a friend
do you know when shell be home
she didnt really say
sam nods and steps back as he prepares to leave
i didnt recognize you
alyssa said you dont even have plumbing over there
not a shower
colleen takes sam by the arm and nudges him into the house
sam is slowly making his way around the room taking note of everything some dried flowers a yearbook a cabinet full of cds dirty clothes stuffed in a hamper
he walks into the bathroom before walking back out and making one more round
robin is sitting between her sons on the sofa watching a movie
peter enters the room carrying his jacket
the goddamn traffic
were we going out to dinner
robin focuses on her husband but the boys are riveted to the television
is lois still here
ill make you something
robin stands as adam and ryan try to hold her down
did someone call to tell you id be late
robin walks into the kitchen without responding
sams in the shower obscured by the sandblasted glass
bro i need you tonight
sam bumps an elbow against the glass as he opens the shower door enough to look out
josh is sitting up on the marble countertop
i locked the door
josh holds up a tiny screwdriver
itll take you like twenty thirty minutes
does alyssa know
you got any weed
you got the money
sam waits a beat before closing the shower door
alyssa sent me up to see if you wanted to hang around and watch a movie with her and her mom
the round copper tube is braced and nailed to the side of the garage on it hangs a shower curtain
george is making noises inside the curtain as he showers
i know theres an explanation
george pulls back the shower curtains just enough to see kurt standing by in his police uniform
no hot water
george is shivering as he closes the curtain back up
dokos called to complain that you and a boy are squatting illegally in the garage of your house
check the permits
it was built as a guesthouse
its a legally rentable unit grandfathered when south laguna was incorporated
without warning the copper tubing holding the hanging curtain falls to the ground
george turns the water off and grabs a towel
unfortunately his ass is not what the towel covers
now that should be illegal
alyssa and colleen are curled up on the sofa as josh and sam stick their heads in to say goodbye
thanks for the shower
i want you both to stay
and candy too
alyssa holds up a huge bowl of popcorn and the dvd case
im gonna give him a ride in my car
ill see you tomorrow
come over anytime you need to sam
thanks id like that
the only thing keeping sam from staying is josh who jerks him out by the shirt
with kurt in the only chair george hands him a cup of coffee and sits down on the pullout sofa which is pulled out
im surprised he hasnt left
i havent forced him to work
i only wet him down once
why would he leave
sam rushes in and grabs a sweater before starting out
sam stops at the door and waits impatiently
where are you going
i dont know
when are you going to be back
i dont know
well until you know you cant go
sam is gone in a flash
kurt studies george for a second
im not very good at it
kurt nods agreed hes not
robin arranges an attractive plate of food which she sticks in the microwave
peter walks in wearing different clothes but the same personality
i hope your ex husband is equipped for the havoc of sam because it seems absolutely blissful here tonight
he sits down at the table opening up a newspaper as robin stares at him
do you think its odd your kids dont hug you
it would worry me
peter glances up from the paper focusing on robin
if i let everything that should worry me worry me id be dead from worry
what would you be if you asked adam and ryan to run in now and hug you
id be you
the answer bothers robin enough that peter cant concentrate back on the paper
ill do it if thats what you want
robin walks out of the kitchen
peter folds the paper and shoves it across the granite counter
sam and josh are parked on a street that overlooks the valley east of laguna beach
they share a joint as josh explains the specifics of the job
you dont have to do a thing
just get in and get out
as quick as you can
close your eyes and think of whatever
sam hands the joint to josh
whats your deal with alyssa
i wasnt sure
she wouldnt even fucking go out with until she was sixteen
i mean thats not even a rule just her own thing
she like figures things out on her own and then thats it
a black mercedes benz pulls to a stop a ways down the street
josh hands sam a cell phone
if this rings run
sam is scared and it shows
he already knows everything about what he cant do
you can tell him not to even look at you if you want
im thinking its too weird now
josh pulls a baggie of grass and holds it out for sam who takes it and stuffs it in his pants pocket
it beats working
josh hands sam the joint
inhale and get out
sam is quick to inhale but slow to get out
josh takes the joint and sam steps out
he walks slowly to the mercedes opens the door and climbs in
josh turns the cd on to gusters all the way up to heaven
sam closes the door to the mercedes
he said to only look up he said to never look down down is where we came from
its an odd song sung in a happy tempo a whistling refrain overtakes the lyrics as josh inhales
he said to hope for the best and take a load off my chest
soon i could be happy and go all the way up to heaven and go all the way back home
with the music loud josh misses the police car as it stops behind him without the lights
too late for a getaway he fumbles for his cell phone and tosses the joint out the open window
the officer approaches the porsche with his hand on his gun
what did you toss into the brush
josh furtively presses send on his cell phone as he faces the officer with a guilty face
he said i might need his help no one gets high on themselves
i just seem so lonely hes just trying to be nice and spread around his advice
i could be happy
turn off the music
as the music stops the door to the mercedes opens and sam hops out with his pants around his ankles
the officer notices and walks towards the mercedes
the parking lights flash red as the car starts and flees the scene
sam yanks up his pants and leaps down the hillside falling and rolling in the brush as the officer yells for him to stop
josh starts his car but the officer dissuades him from leaving by removing his gun
josh turns off the engine
oh its working now
what did you toss into the brush
before josh can feign innocence again the brush starts to smolder
sam is spotted with weeds and dirt as he continues his way down the steep hillside holding up his pants
after hes sure hes safe he sits down and rests his head in his hands
he starts to shake frightened by his actions
he drops onto his back buttons and zips his pants as he starts to cry
slowly he stops crying but keeps staring up at the sky which is loaded with stars and a full moon
mesmerized by the brilliant night sam cant stop staring
george is removing the last of the windows carefully prying it out of the casement as robin pulls up in her range rover
she steps out dressed in levis boots and a t shirt carrying a large bag
she smiles and walks toward george dropping the food sack on the patio table
its not breakfast yet
i dreamed about your house last night
finished or unfinished
it was perfect george
it was so real
didnt you once dream you could lick people well though
that wasnt a dream
that was sam
with his ear infection
my tongue around the edge of his ear is what cured him
george isnt quite sure how to take her comment
finally he points to the garage
go in there and lick his attitude
the antibiotics werent working
beat its what i believe george
george stares at robin for a second before he nods
you were wrong about the first year you know
it takes robin a second to understand hes saying he loved her when they married
ive been wrong a lot in my life
its like foresight without a future
robin almost smiles george confessing love ten years dead
i have three hours before i pick up adam and ryan
beat where will i be most useful
robin glances around assessing the best use of her time
with your hands or your tongue
youre not well
robin picks up a pile of splintered board and tosses them in the garbage bin
robin and george carry a twelve foot beam from inside the shack and set it down on cinder blocks
both look exhausted as they head back in for another beam
sam saunters out of the garage in shorts sits down on the patio chair and opens the sack his mother had packed for lunch
he pulls out a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and starts eating as george and robin emerge from the shack with another beam
robin and george set the beam down and turn to sam as they both wipe sweat off their faces
sam chews his sandwich ignoring them both
robin walks close to sam trying to capture his attention
ryan has a game later
he asked if youd come and watch
sam glances up at his mother just long enough to let her know he hates her then drops the sandwich and walks back into the garage
a city inspectors car pulls to a stop on the street and bob larson steps out with a clipboard
robin passes him as she walks back to her range rover
ive been dreading you
bob and george shake hands as robin drives off
do you happen to have an unenclosed toilet in close proximity to a kitchen
and if i enclosed it
an exhaust system or a window is code
allowed outside the enclosed area
sam walks out of the garage in long pants and a shirt
where is it
a friend of yours is here
did you got through my pants
i might have a solution
george grabs his chain saw and walks to the garage with sam and bob in tow
whered you put it
george walks to an armoire and empties it
he grabs a hammer and bangs pries and pulls the back off then dumps the cabinet onto the floor
i know you took it
i want it now
george yanks the chain saw to a roar and fashions an oval cut a few feet deep on the cabinet base
he kills the saw lifts the armoire and scoots it in front of the toilet
bob grimaces as george opens the armoire revealing the toilet inside
i hate to ask about a window
to sam i flushed it down the toilet
oh my god
george jerk starts the chain saw again and fashions a small opening above the toilet ripping through the studs wire mesh tar paper and stucco fine dust invades the space
like a storm
bob coughs as he writes in his book
george kills the chain saw and sets it down as he surveys his work
if i had a gun id kill you
bob seems fairly anxious to conclude his business
i assume youll fill the
uh window with glass
if thats what it takes
whats in my pants is none of your fucking business
a little rattled i would say youre in compliance
i hope that makes the pain in the ass that called you happy
george is staring at sam
bob backs out of the garage
you and me both
with bob gone george walks to sam and gets in his face
everything about you is my business
what you smoke what you swallow what you sniff its all my business
sam slams his fists against his own chest maddened
ive been using since i was twelve
youre all so unbelievably stupid
you didnt give a shit about anything i did until now
ill apologize for everything but today
today i give a shit
youre too fucking late
the gloves on the table are for you
you cant make me do a thing
sit down for a second
george gently guides sam back onto the bed
sam hops up mad
ill call the cops if you touch me again
george sets sam back onto the bed not so gently this time
sam is less eager to hop up in defiance
oh so youre in the big shit now
people go to prison for what you just did to me
my dad used to play a game
i never really understood what it was until after he was gone
sam appears immensely disinterested
i was holding for someone
that wasnt even mine
the game was to make me smaller than he was
no matter what
he could be almost invisible as a human being but i had to be smaller
so if i got good grades i was a pussy for not playing football
if i cut my hair for him it wasnt short enough
if i shaved it i looked like a psycho
i never won the game
and if he couldnt make me smaller with words
tears well in georges eyes
sam is caught up enough in what his father has to say that he has to feign his lack of interest
ill have to pay him back
i wont ever hit you
beat i dont want you smaller
i want you to be happy
not here with me
not home with your mother
not up in tahoe
beat youre what i was most of my life sam
i see it in your eyes
in your sleep
in your answer to everything
youre barely alive
im not even listening
you know that great thing though
is that change can be so constant you dont even feel the difference until there is one
it can be so slow that you dont even notice that your life is better or worse until it is
beat or it can just blow you away
make you something different in an instant
it happened to me
george walks to the garage door as he wipes his eyes
he stops and turns back around to face sam
build this house with me
george walks out leaving sam on the bed to think
george gathers a pile of splintered boards and tosses them into the dumpster
he works while guster sleeps
the sun is fierce low on the horizon with a heat that distorts the distance
george is sweating and shirtless as sam walks out of the garage with the gloves on and stands staring at his father
after a beat george notices him
i have to pay back what you flushed down the toilet
beat i want ten dollars an hour
then im done
he points out the roofless shell of a shack
it all has to come down before we can start again
beat knock it down
george picks up a sledghammer and hands it to sam
sam hoists the hefty hammer and with some true effort slams it on a sideboard
he slams again and again as george picks up a slightly smaller sledgehammer
i hated this house from the second my father cheated everyone and put it in my name
george takes a good hard whack at the wall knocking a huge hunk of it down
sam stops to watch
twenty years of hating what you live in
what you are
this is the end of it sam
im gonna build something of me here that i can be proud to give to you
i dont want it
george yells as he lands the hammer into the wall again
sam is alarmed by his fathers blatant rage
do whatever you want with it
i dont care
all i want from you is for you to remember we built this house together
we havent build shit
youre just tearing down your father
it feels good
george strikes another blow to the house joined with a mad wail
sam starts low a whisper of a scream but quickly builds soon rivaling george in volume as he pounds away
this soul letting cleansing ritual is both impelling and frightening to watch
tom and barbara colleen and her maid step out of their houses drawn and perplexed by the guttural noise
both boys are asleep as robin enters and wakes them with the drop and bounce back to your feet from the mattress method
its morning sleepyheads
they both wake with a groan
robin leaps onto adam and tickles him to life
robin is quickly finishing a breakfast of oatmeal and fresh fruit with adam and ryan who are still dressed in pajamas
why do we have to get up and eat with you this early
i just thought it would be nice
are you going to see sam again
i thought i might stop by
all day again
not all day
ill be home after lunch
robin stands and dumps her dishes in the sink
you can go back to bed
or lois might let you go swimming
i wanna be with you today
theres not much to do there
i mean its all work
we can work
robin focuses on her sons both of whom seem willing to work
ryan would you rather swim or work
can we really help build a house
peter walks in surprised by everyone being up
why is everyone up so early
george is knocking away the forms used to pour the foundation
sam walks out of the garage with a towel he shields his eyes from the morning sun as he watches his father work
without make up or a nose ring and with the black dye gone from his hair and the polish from his nails sam is a handsome kid
george looks happy laying bare the foundation that will hold his home
sam walks to alyssas house unseen by his father
colleen is walking with sam toward the stairs
if shes not up you can use my shower
youre here early today
were getting out of the ground today
sam looks fairly excited as he rushes up the stairs
sam stops at the door and knocks
i can use your moms
alyssa is curled up in bed cuddling a stuffed bear as sam walks in and closes the bedroom door behind him
were you with josh when the cops arrested him
alyssa sits up in bed holding the sheet to her chest
nervously not really
he got busted
his parents took his car
theyre making him ride a bicycle the rest of the summer
sam cant help but like that
he asked me to tell you that you owe him a hundred dollars
he can peddle over anytime he wants to for it
sam breaks into a full on smile
this is serious
i dont have my license
he was my ride
im just here to shower
sam walks into the bathroom before he closes the door he faces alyssa with another smile she tosses her bear at him
george is prying off the last of the boards when hes hit with a pain that takes him to his knees
he drops the crowbar and sits down in the dirt as guster walks over to comfort him
george takes deep breaths and closes his eyes as he tries to gain control over the pain
the doorknob jiggles jiggles and turns alyssa opens the door and walks in dressed in a t shirt and panties
once again sam jumps and jams his elbow to the frosted glass as he partially opens the shower door
is this like a past time with people
alyssa sets a tiny screwdriver on the vanity
ive seen lots of people
its not a big thing for me
hand me a towel
im getting out
im coming in
i dont want you to
were not gonna do anything
why are you so stupid
why are you so uptight
i dont even
what do you mean
i dont even know what that means
it means im gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way
hand me a towel
hand me a towel
sam is anxious
alyssa takes off her t shirt and pulls down her panties before grabbing a towel she hands it to sam as she forces her way into the shower
barely visible through the frosted glass alyssa wets her hair as sam stares in her direction
the towel drops to the tiled floor
george is curled up in bed the prescription bottle and a glass resting on a table
hes holding onto his side still in some pain
a honk gets guster barking outside
ryan and adam run to guster with glee as robin steps out of the range rover with a large covered basket and a boom box
she sets the basket and radio on the patio table and searches for george ending up at the entrance to the garage
george has hidden the prescription bottle and is sitting on the bed as robin walks in
i thought youd be up with the sun
my stupid back
robin sits down on the bed next to george concerned
do you need anything
ill go to the pharmacy
i have some demerol at home
i took something
robin runs her hand down georges spine
he wont use my shower
i dont get it
outside adam and ryan are each calling guster
you brought your kids
i kind of said that maybe they could do something
they really wanted to come
i really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me
i dont think theyll be too much trouble
ill find something that wont kill them
let them keep their eyes and fingers
youre a good mother
with some effort george stands
do you need help
i think so
robin stands and wraps her arm around his waist and he drapes his arms over her shoulder as they walk out of the garage
i woke up this morning at three and couldnt fall back asleep
everyday i think i see more of sam than ive seen in years
adam runs with abandon to sam and alyssa as robin helps george to a patio chair
adam runs into sam with a hug then steps back
whats that for
mom said i should
i would have anyway
sam appears awkward as he rests his hand for a second on adams shoulder
who are you
who are you
im his brother
im his friend
adam views her suspiciously as they walk across alyssas grass to the patio
mom says we can build a house
its clear that robin is falling in love with her son again
alyssa extends her hand to robin and they shake
youre so nice to let sam use your shower
hes got a standing invitation
sam instantly flushes red
sam walks to ryan whos been standing back from the group
sam drapes his arm over ryans shoulder and together they walk to the foundation
so you wanna build a house
if we do will it stay up
a blink song blasts from the boom box on the patio table
ryan and adam slather paint remover on five old painted doors
they work with gloves and brushes and appear meticulous in their application
alyssa and sam nail and bolt the corner posts to the rim joist as robin and george work on the stick framed door deck
while george is moving a little slower than usual it appears that the pain is nearly gone
as the song ends robin rushes toward the radio
i brought a few of my own
someone stop her
robin runs to her car and retrieves a few cds
she slips the cd in and we hear john hiats distance
its a slow soft song that brings a smile to georges face
its been a while
this was my very first slow dance
did you know him before you knew dad
since seventh grade
tell him how you made me fall in love with you
i smiled at him
watch out for the smile boys
robins body moves slightly to the music as she smiles
the boys arent sure what to make of the advice
you are the beautiful love my lover i am the distant shore so far away
there is so much to uncover loves hiding
what is this distance for
what is it for
whos up for a dance
robin glances around for any takers finally focusing on george
just dont hug me too tight
adam walks to his mother and they hold hands as they dance
sam sits down to watch
george wears a smile that wipes the last of the pain from his face
thats all you get
im busy today
adam backs away and grabs his paintbrush
robin stops dancing as she focuses on george
lets see if youve gotten any better
oh im worse
much much worse
robin waits to see how worse
george finally walks to her and takes her in his arms
he must have been better than this
the waltz smooths out as they dance closer holding tighter
we fill the air with silent stares
but still no one there we are strangers
alyssa decides its time to go
ill see you tomorrow
sam watches alyssa walk away but hes quickly drawn back to his mother and father dancing
ryan appears anxious unsure of the music and george
when did you fall in love with my dad
the dance stops
george lets go of robin as she focuses on ryan
when i found out i was pregnant with you
sam is on the pull out bed listening to music through head phones
we hear a flush the armoire doors open and george walks out of the cabinet washes his hands turns off the light and drops into bed
a nightlight stuck in a socket above the bed casts a dull blue light over the room
sam takes the headphones off
after a long silence i took some of your vicodin
i like how it feels not to feel
george turns onto his side to face his son
i know the feeling
how do you become something youre not
what would you like to be
what im not
what are you now
thats not true
see thats the thing
i am what i say i am
i know parts of who you are
what do you know about me
george drops back onto his back
he takes his time to answer
when you started first grade and your mom went to work it was so she could save for an apartment
but then she met peter and skipped the idea of renting
hes got nothing to do with me
i couldnt imagine how i could compete with him for any part of you
so i didnt
he wanted you to have his last name
i let him even take that
he was a prick when i was six and hes a prick today
george turns onto his side to face sam again
i wish you had told me then
im telling you now
i gave up on you
id be in tahoe having fun if you had given up
what would you be doing now
getting high i guess
if i asked you to stop would you
i havent used anything for two days
im proud of you sam
and hide whatever that new drug is you have
i like it
sam turns away from his father and puts his headphones on
the music bleeds through the headphones in a muffled rumble
i put a gun to my fathers head once
georges voice is soft theres no chance sam can hear
have you ever thought like that
ive been thinking
watching you work
how much do you hate me
beat he was passed out
just screaming at my mother before
under cooked meat
i went back to my room
put the barrel close to his ear and chickened out again
not my dad
hid in my room
not even me
beat of course it was a bb gun
but it still would have hurt like hell
sam notices his fathers mouth moving and takes off the headphones
are you talking
i was just thinking about my mom
she wouldnt leave him
i remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses
i mean it was dark outside and in
but we never talked about it
to hide a black eye
why wouldnt she leave
i think she was terrified of living with him
but maybe even more terrified of life without him
i would have killed him
everything would have been better if you had
youd have liked your grandmother
and thered be a girl out there thatd have her mother
i remember reading about her in the paper
they couldnt find her father and her mother was dead
i still feel guilty about that
do you ever wish you had done it
george thinks about that for a second
i loved him too much
after everything he did to you and your mom
thats so weird
sam slips his headphones back on
guster is squatting on the lush lawn of the mansion taking a dump
david bursts out from his house rushes to his black mercedes and tries once again to run over guster
no such luck
guster moves on to another lawn as mr
dokos drops over the curb and drives off down the street
in the late june afternoon with a clotted cloud sky robin adam ryan sam alyssa and george work at building a house
adam and ryan are staining the interior doors they stripped days earlier
george and sam carry large wood beam to the foundation and slip it into the pocket mortise of the laminated beam that spans from pier post to pier post
robin grabs a drill and screws the cast in tie down to the wood beam
alyssa is sawing a rafter in half as her mother walks across the grass with a huge basket of food
is anyone hungry
with music playing in the background everyone is packed around the patio table eating pasta and drinking lemonade
i like the color im making the doors
the absolute best color ive ever seen in my life
adam lights up pleased to be praised
how many bedrooms will your house have
will sam live with you or us
its a quick response that draws robins attention
sam lightly bops adam on the head
so put your plans of my room in the trash
i dont think dad wants you home
adam thats not true
yes it is
would you stop being ridiculous
your father wants sam home as much as i do
sam starts laughing
sam cant stop laughing
it wasnt meant to be
sam and george stand at exactly the same time and walk back to the house
without a word they work together as they continue to frame the house
suddenly george turns back to the pack of people at the table and loudly proclaims i love you
he goes back to work as sam glances at him amused
adam and ryan are surprised and it shows on their faces
robins in bed reading as peter emerges from the bathroom in pajama bottoms
you know what ive decided
robin glances up from her book to peters hairy chest
to shave your chest
we should take a vacation
peter grabs his pajama top and slips it on as he climbs into bed
robin sets her book down
the biggest waste of time since television
do you remember anything ive said that wasnt negative
robin takes long enough to think that peter forges on
just the two of us
it takes robin a few seconds to answer
id love to drive through new england in the fall
sooner than the fall
he closes in on her kisses her cheek
after the kids are back in school
lois will stay with them
or we can pawn them off on your parents
out of reasonable excuses robin opts for the truth
im helping george build his house
ive been helping for the last few days
i told you sam was working
i mean he really is
that was the plan
we couldnt stand him and george needed help
as true as it is this still irritates robin
i cant go right now
you cant go because of sam
we havent been away together for three years
what difference does a few months make
you cant go with me because of sam
sam is working at something for the first time in his life
once in a while he even talks to me
i want to be around for that
so am i robin
im working at something too
im even talking
do you want to be around for it
peter is intense close up not giving her breathing room
i dont know
robin whispers her answer
peter pulls away and settles down on his back
robin doesnt move for the longest time
finally she eases onto her back and turns out the light
i was talking about our marriage
silence finishes the conversation
with an extended plate and overhung rafters the frame takes its form rooms are roughed in windows are framed two gable dormers distinguish the common rafter roof in the front
and a frame for a balcony juts out over the ocean in back
robin and adam are locking in and hoisting the sheets of plywood on a pulley system up to ryan and george who are stripped down to shorts george is thinner
sam is showering as alyssa walks in from the bedroom and joins him no protest is voiced this time around
alyssa smiles at sam as she grabs a wash cloth and slathers it with liquid soap
whats the point of this
does everything have to have a point
i dont get it
im not really supposed to touch you but i can look
alyssa faces sam as she washes her body with the cloth
are you sure youre totally into guys
what are you talking about
im not gay
sam glances down at himself alyssa looks too
i mean hello
they both look up
i was wondering
youre driving me crazy
do you know what its like trying to jack off in an armoire
youre off you know
youre way way off
i thought i was helping you
it would help me if i could kiss you
no i dont
i thought we were just friends
what you think you know doesnt have much to do with reality
i mean i hope im not the first to say that about you
okay but then well just be friends
sam stands still unsure of his next move
have you ever even kissed a girl
sam appears shocked she would even ask he hasnt but shes not supposed to know that
alyssa makes the move closes the distance and kisses him
apart it appears to be something they enjoyed
sam wraps his arms around her presses himself against her and kisses her again
after a few seconds of making out sam jerks once then again as he backs away
alyssa grimaces as she glances down
alyssa steps into a corner of the shower as sam turns around and rests his forehead on the tile
youre scrubbing the shower down
george and sam are on ladders reinforcing a window opening on the second floor with a x spline
ryan and adam are flat on their backs on the grass with guster between them dog tired
robin is at the grill with hamburgers as alyssa prepares the table for dinner
you must have a really great husband
robin glances up at alyssa
why is that
just i mean well youre here every single day
hes at work while im here
i guess id just be jealous if i were him
well he doesnt need to worry
if my kids and my wife were always at an ex husbands house id worry
hes not the type to worry
robin is slightly pissed at alyssa grilling her she flips the hamburgers and calls out lets eat
music is playing softly in the background
peter is sitting alone in a chair with a drink in hand
after a bit lois walks in holding a can of pledge and a rag
id be glad to fix you something
no im fine
lois nods and walks away
for all the presence of the room peter looks small and frayed in it lost in his own house
lunch is over
adam is wrestling with guster on the lawn
robin is taking money from her purse as george hands sam the keys to his truck
nothing r okay
enough for drinks popcorn and candy
and video games after
to sam will you come in and say hi
sam shrugs takes the money and keys as ryan and adam rush close to him
do we have to take her
the three boys turn to watch as alyssa now dressed in a dress walks across the lawn to join them
its literally frightening how beautiful alyssa can look with her tan and white dress sam shutters
josh is peddling down the highway on his bike sweating in the full afternoon sun
george is hewing a beam as robin watches from a chair
i should go
george stops and wipes the sweat from his forehead
maybe you shouldnt come everyday
i like to be with sam
its just that theres less that adam and ryan can do anymore
beat id hate to have them bored
robin stands and walks to george
i know theyre not much help but they love coming here george
how much time do they get to spend with their dad
what is it with this
they wouldnt spend less time with peter if they lived here
he has no time
robin walks away then back shes frustrated
do you know alyssa thinks something is up with us
shes giving me crap about being away from peter and now youre trying to do the same thing
what no one seems to realize is that peter isnt there
hes not there
and when he is he isnt
beat so if you dont want me here or you dont want my kids here just tell me george
ill stop coming
but it wont be because of peter
itll be because you asked me to stop
say what you need to say because im not leaving until i hear it
id rather you not be here
in the distance on the street josh peddles past on his bike
i thought we were helping
i can hire workers to help me
robin nods gathers her things walks to her car climbs in and drives off
colleen is standing in the entry talking to josh
you can come in and wait if youd like
what friends did she go with
robin pulls right back to where she was parked and parks again
she steps out of the car talking
nothing is going on with us is it
when i picked you up from the train station
what you said
what did i say
that thing about i was the most you know beautiful person you had ever known
what was that
that was the truth
youve never said that before
ill say a lot of things ive never said before
it sounded like a pick up line
i cant pick you up
robin sits down weighted by the reason
you bit my finger
if i werent married
george wants to answer quickly dismiss the impossible and move on but emotion catches him off guard
he forces a smile
lets not do this okay
i need to know
you need to know what
do i still love you
robin is surprised by the question
she nods her head
theres not a doubt in my mind that through all my anger
my ego i was faithful in my love for you
from seventh grade on
robin raises her eyebrows what a revelation
that i made you doubt it that i withheld it
thats the greatest mistake of a life full of mistakes
beat but the truth doesnt set us free robin
i can say it as many times as you can stand to hear it
and all that does the only thing is remind us that love isnt enough
not even close
tears well in robins eyes as she stands
i should go
george nods she should
robin walks to her car opens the door she faces george before climbing in
george walks into the garage
george rummages through his sock drawer
pulls out a folded sock and opens it the prescription bottle drops to the floor
he fills a glass and swallows three pills
robin opens the door and heads straight for the kitchen
all i am is what i have
robin jumps and searches for the voice
peters sitting alone in the living room
that sounds pathetic doesnt it
what are you doing home
i always felt i could never marry you without first showing you what a fabulous life you cloud live despite me
robin takes a few steps into the room
you never really trusted me
you live a fabulous life robin
i never asked for more
thats the problem
please dont leave me
peter stands and walks to her
robin doesnt respond
where are the kids
sam took them to a movie
ill be in the bedroom
peter takes her hand and kisses her cheek before walking down the hall
robin stands still trying to assess the exchange
in a bedroom we dont quite recognize two people are in the throes of making love under a silk white sheet
its hard to tell whose voice that is robins
george is in bed awakened by a knock
i fell asleep
alyssa walks in closing the door behind her
sams dropping adam and ryan off
george is slightly out of it with oral morphine he tires to sit up but settles for propping up his head
can you keep sam straight
hes not gay
i found out purely by accident believe me
i mean drugs
catching up i thought you said he was
he wouldnt use around me
i dont like any of it
youre a good girl
i need to ask you something mr
alyssa walks over and lies on the bed beside george
you have to ask like that
i want you to try something with me okay
ive taken a lot of morphine
for my back
can i wait till i can say no and sound convincing
alyssa leans forward and kisses him its a real kiss that lasts a lot longer than it should
and when its over did you feel anything
maybe your tongue
i dont know my mouth is numb
why did you do that
they both stare up at the ceiling
when you dated my mom i saw you kiss her once
you looked like such a good kisser
its the couple making love again this time were close enough to make out colleens face underneath josh who is working with speed if not exact precision
my mother would die
lets shut up and not kill her
oh my god
peter has changed and is on the bed his head propped up by pillows he stairs blankly at the door
robin is sitting alone in the living room in the same spot peter had been sitting earlier
alyssa and george are still beside each other in bed
its not what i was expecting
what did you think it would be
i dont know
realizing more like when i kissed sam
alyssa sits up in bed
more like that
she stands and grabs his big toe
thanks for your time
alyssa waves goodbye and leaves
george is confused by it all
josh looks as though hes been struck by a hammer as he lay on his back with his mouth slack
under the sheet low down colleen is swallowing her pride and showing off her technique
a sudden blaring noise an alarm pierces joshs throaty groan
colleen jumps off the bed the sheet still haunting her head
oh my god
alyssa closes the french door she entered through and rushes to the alarm panel as the siren blares
colleen and josh are frantically pulling on clothes as the noise throws them off balance
with the alarm off alyssa walks to the entry
josh has pulled on his underwear backwards only speed counts
alyssa glances around before heading up the stairs
without a knock alyssa opens the door
the room is empty but the bed is messed
alyssa walks to the master bath following the voice
colleen is standing above josh who is bent over on his knees with a plunger in the bath
i completely forgot
im so sorry josh
beat what are you doing
joshs face is flushed red and beaded with sweat
i put him to work
it takes a second for colleen to realize that alyssa is talking about the plumbing
i couldnt get it to go down
and why was the alarm on
i set it to see if it would work
youd better call and cancel
oh god we dont want the police
colleen is anxious as she rushes out
josh stands and wipes the sweat from his forehead
whats going on
josh fumbles and fidgets finally finding a way out
whats the deal with you and sam
robin is fixing dinner as we hear the front door open
adam is talking as he rushes into the kitchen
i got to play one video game for three hours straight
ryan enters right behind him
wouldnt you move to another one if the one you were playing made you look stupid
robin checks the entry to the kitchen no sam
thats how you get things right is to always try and never give up
i guess it depends on what you give up on
robins face lights up as sam walks into the kitchen
there were no pgs
so i just gave them money to play games
can you stay for dinner
depends on what id give up on
robin opens the oven and shows sam a platter of lasagna
it looks like a trap
robin turns to adam excited at having sam stay for dinner
go tell your father were eating
dads home already
in the bedroom
adam takes off in a run as sam walks to the sink and washes his hands before grabbing a stack of plates for dinner
he arranges the five on the table and then heads back for utensils as adam runs back in
hes not there
check the bathroom
i checked everywhere
hes not there
gusters at the door whining
george and sam are asleep
colleen is sitting alone at the kitchen table drinking coffee as alyssa walks in
what are you doing up so early
i couldnt sleep last night
im supposed to be mad at you but im not
colleen is trembling as alyssa pours herself a big bowl of lucky charms
what do you mean
using josh like that
alyssa eats her cereal as colleen bursts into a confession
i will never forgive myself
i know i took advantage
i should have my head examined
alyssa looks confused as she swallows her lucky charms
he said you asked him to tighten your toilet seat too
thats so uncool
colleen quickly nods
i wont do it again
alyssa keeps an eye on her mother as she continues on with her cereal
guster is taking a dump on the immaculate lawn
david dokos rushes from the house dressed in a suit and picks up the shit with a gloved hand and heaves it at guster as the dog trots back to
tom and barbara the old early walkers of the street stop and watch as david picks up more crap and tosses it onto georges driveway
he notices tom and barbara
mind your own fucking business
tom and barbara stay silent as david dokos walks back into his house and slams the front door shut
josh is in eleventh gear on his ten speed peddling like a demon for the becks house
robin pulls to a stop and ryan and adam run from the range rover to sam and alyssa who are helping an electrician dale install the outside boxes and sockets
he was there and then he wasnt
sam faces his mother as she walks toward the house
he hasnt called
who are you
robin shakes her head no to sam
dale turns to face adam
im the electrician
im the builder
sam turns back to finish what he was working on as alyssa grabs adam with a hug
george is swallowing two pills as robin knocks on the half open door opening it all the way in the process
is your back still killing you
i didnt think youd come today
i kept thinking about it what you said
i hope you were trying to keep me away fro the sake of me
peter left me yesterday
no fuck you
no are you in love with george
what did he say
ill be in the bedroom
robin walks to george and holds on to his shirt
i couldnt walk in there
beat so he left
she rests the side of her head against his chest
he kisses her hair
outside a hammer beats a reminder that theyre not alone
the ocean drowns the sound long enough for robin to kiss georges chin and in that instant the instant where everything but the touch washes away george kisses robin with
such punch that it knocks them onto the bed
they continue to forget everything as they roll with the punch
dad dale needs to know
sam stops at the jamb of the open door as his mother and father scramble to their feet from the bed
i had a kink in my
as george falters robin feels compelled to complete the lie
the door was open
a quick confession i dont know what im doing
i wouldnt let adam or ryan see you doing it
it wont happen again
george and robin are flustered embarrassed by being caught something sam clearly relishes
dale wants to know if we should run an outside outlet for christmas lights with a switch inside
beat have him put it on a separate line
at christmas well pact it so full of lights well make god wear sunglasses
sam laughs grabs the door and closes it on his parents
robin slumps truly embarrassed
i could die
so could i
george touches robins chin draws her head up
he stares at her afraid to say what he needs to say
are you going to kiss me
its not my back thats killing me
robin furrows her brow not understanding
george surrounds her head with his hands and kisses her forehead
adam and ryan are helping dale run the electrical lines alyssa and sam drill screws into the second story floorboards
music is playing loud on the radio
josh stops peddling quite a distance from georges house and gets off to search for alyssa
only seeing adam ryan and dale josh pulls out his cell and dials
frustrated and anxious colleen slips off the dress shes wearing and tries another one as the phone rings
josh is standing behind a tree talking on his cell phone as he stares at georges house
i dont see her
beat please just open the door when i knock
he slips the phone back in his pocket hops back on the bike and makes a beeline toward colleens house
busted josh has no choice but to join alyssa
i was hoping
go for a ride
alyssa and sam are leaning out the framed second story window
on the handlebars or your shoulders
are you afraid of heights
sam walks away from the window and goes back to work
can you help us out
my parents cut my allowance off
without a car im totally screwed
george is paying sam ten dollars an hour
sam sticks his head back out the window
hey i can get you three hundred cash for two hours
josh is fuming as he stares at sam
its just a joke
a stupid joke
i could use the money
sam turns away from josh
george walks out the garage as he wipes his eyes
i recruited some help for the roof
george walks to josh and extends his hand
adam races to george with a hug something unexpected
adam rushes back to work as george breaks into a smile
alyssa rushes down the stairs and straight into georges arms
george is still smiling as he tucks a strand of alyssas hair behind her ear
ryan sort of saunters over to george with his hands sunk deep in his pockets
without asking george wraps his arms around ryan with a hug
afterward i just wanted to know where mom was
she needs to be alone i think
because dad left
shes a little sad is all
i dont even care if he ever comes back
ryan walks back to adam whos been standing still listening
josh you look like you could use a hug
george is too quick with his hug
josh is stiff as a board
sam looks pissed as he walks away from the second story window and resumes screwing the floorboards
george sets his eyes on dale as he opens his arms wide
dont even think about it
george walks toward dale with his arms still extended
well they got me started
i swear to god ill use these wires and shock you so bad your tongue will turn black
adam and ryan are excited as george closes the distance
finally dale drops the harmless wire and takes off in a run
colleen is pacing the kitchen in a silky dress we havent seen before
finally she grabs the phone
george is propped up on the chaise lounge next to the patio table where everyone has dropped their crap
sam and josh are sheeting the roof with tarpaper
robin is still in the garage
one of two cell phones on the table begins to ring
would you get it for me
dale is in the middle of wiring a box
just let mine ring
i dont know
george picks up the offender unsure whose phone it is
into phone hello
into phone where are you
youre driving me crazy waiting like this
i want you in me now
george nearly drops the phone he sits up straight
into phone colleen
colleen sits down panicked
into phone i
george holds the phone out and examines it for a second
is it mine
god i hope not
thats not mine
josh trips slips and slides off the roof to the ground below as alyssa lets out a loud scream
colleen tosses the receiver as though it were a ball on fire
everyone including robin is circled around josh who is sprawled on the ground
maybe ill go home
is that bone sticking out
im an idiot to have you up there
its my fault
an ambulance is heard approaching
colleen runs from her house shes now dressed more appropriately in levis and a blouse
i heard a scream
if i could just stand up
colleen stops a few feet short and covers her mouth with a trembling hand
i think he might have broken a leg
the ambulance silences the siren as it turns onto the cul de sac and stops in front of georges house
robin george and sam are sitting at the patio table as ryan and adam play catch with guster
two ribs a finger a leg a bruised kidney and a mild concussion arent bad considering he landed on brick
neither robin nor sam attempts a response
finally i better get the kids home
not a perfect day
george stands because robins standing
without warning robin begins to cry again
ryan and adam stop playing ball
sam studies her before finally lowering his eyes
with her kids looking on george stands still hesitant to comfort her
theres a moment where all that there is where the only thing seen or heard is robins pain
after an awkward amount of time she wipes her eyes wipes her nose crosses around the table to sam and kisses the top of his head then his cheek
without a word she walks to her car and climbs in ryan and adam quickly join her in the car
george is brushing his teeth dribbling and foaming over the only sink in the garage
sam is propped up in bed with guster dressed on top of the sheets fingering through a stack of cds
he glances over at his father twice before speaking
you look like shit lately
george spits and rinses facing sam as he wipes his mouth
you look better than ever
i dont think mom cares that much that my
that peter left
she seemed upset
whats wrong with your back
sam tries to look slightly less interested than he is by continuing to flip through the cds
george sits down
i mean do you need to have surgery on it or what
because those pills youre taking are for a lot of pain
and youre going through them quick
are you taking them still
no but i count them
in a sock isnt new you know
this is not easy for george he fumbles a bit before answering
im having a problem with cancer
sam stops flipping though the cds
i dont know what that means
what kind of problem
the kind where there isnt really an answer
i still dont know what that means
i wanted you here so we could have a few months together
maybe everything happens for a reason
something bad to force something good
sam looks somewhat panicked
are you dying
this is not easy for george he fumbles a bit before answering
im having a problem with cancer
sam stops flipping through the cds
i dont know what that means
what kind of problem
the kind where there isnt really an answer
i still dont know what that means
i wanted you here so we could have a few months together
maybe everything happens for a reason
something bad to force something good
sam looks somewhat panicked

george nods his head
and you told mom today
sam whacks the cds off his stomach they scatter across the floor
guster scoots off the bed in a panic
you knew you were dying from the start
sam bounds out of bed in a rage
were all dying from the start
beat i just got picked for advanced placement
you lied to me
i would have lied to me if i thought id believe it
this was all for your sake wasnt it
having me here
trying to get me to like you
i never tried to get you to like me
beat i tried to get you to love me
you fucking pulled it off
sam storms out of the garage
colleen pulls a robe around her nightgown as the doorbell rings again and again
she flips on a light and opens the door
sam backs away from the door as he talks
is alyssa here
whats the matter sam
my dads dying
i really need to talk to alyssa
alyssa is leaning over the upstairs railing
sam walks up the stairs as colleen closes the door
sea lions romp on a rock offshore as gulls circle above
the sun sheets the morning on the water thats blinding
alyssa is under the covers holding onto sam who is still dressed
both are asleep
george is in bed in pain
a prescription bottle is open beside him and pills are scattered on the sheet
a knock on the door forces george to gather the pills and hide the bottle
kurt the cop opens the door dressed in civilian clothes
its my day off
i thought id help with the plumbing
i need you to do me a favor
concerned god you look like crap george
i want you to find someone for me
colleen walks out her front door straight to her neighbors house
after a bit of ringing and a bit of waiting tom of the walking tom and barbara answers the door in a bathrobe
does your son still own a company that builds houses
dale is wiring with adam and ryan helping
kurt robin and colleen are setting up and sealing the plastic plumbing pipes
two new men greg and miguel are on the roof finishing up where josh fell down
music is playing on the radio
george is asleep on the chaise lounge
alyssa walks across the grass and stops to stare at george
tears well in her eyes
alyssa continues on to the house and walks up the stairs
hes been asleep for hours
is sam okay
he wont leave my room
will he talk to me
robin accepts the answer
slowly they all return to work
the day is productive as we see the black drainpipes and the copper water runs coming together like a maze
the roof is shingled and the wiring is nearly complete
whether awake or asleep george spends the day in the chaise lounge
a city inspectors truck pulls to a stop and bob larsen steps out with a clipboard and a concerned look on his face
george is dozing on drugs
youre not a plumber kurt
kurt finishes hooking in a plugged tee at a turn and stands
i worked every summer with my dad
check out what ive done
its not whether its good or bad
you know that
its whether your licensed
frustrated kurt glances around at all his good work before answering
are you still renting that illegal non conforming studio under your house for a thousand a month
bob opens his clipboard and checks a number of items off
looks good to me
oh thats embarrassing
that was too easy
at least look around
i really did do it right
that isnt why im here anyway
george wakes up and quickly hones in on bob
ive been dreading you
bob walks toward george as he talks
one of your neighbors is adamant your home has exceeded its approved height
hes filed to have construction stopped immediately
its thirty feet
well if it is we have a problem
george stands he appears slightly shaky
i have the permit
after your last extension request and with design review and the board of adjustment and the appeals to the city council was there an amended permit
to the patio and one north facing window
suddenly realizing and six inches to the height
george sits back down
everyone emerges from the house to join george and bob
why do you let your dog crap on his lawn day after day
i dont let him
he just loves to
hell make you tear the entire roof off rather than give you any satisfaction
im afraid you wont be able to continue until this is settled
you can always go back and file an appeal
that would take weeks
just so you know well be here working tomorrow and every day after until this house is finished
hell call us again and then hell call the police
he has an attorney on retainer
just so you know
robin turns and walks back into the house
colleen alyssa adam and ryan soon follow
if he hears a hammer hell have you arrested
robin picks up the hammer and pounds a nail into a piece of wallboard
dale miguel greg and kurt walk back to the house and go back to work
bob glances at george who shrugs
colleen is watching the news as alyssa walks in to say goodnight
im going to bed
has he eaten anything at all
alyssa shakes her head no as colleen flips on the tv
id be more comfortable if he slept in the guestroom
id be more comfortable if you hadnt slept with josh
and george would be more comfortable if he werent dying
colleen is embarrassed alyssa knows the truth
comfort doesnt mean that much when just getting through the night is the goal mom
alyssa walks out
colleen curls up and hides clutching pillows on the couch
george is shaking and sweating as he tries to crawl off the bed to his sock drawer
guster wakes up and hops off sams bed to lick george on the face
george is in real pain as he drops to the floor on his back
he winces and cries out as he pushes himself forward with his legs toward the dresser
george suddenly stops pushing his legs slump flat on the concrete floor
his eyes flutter shut as guster continues to lick his face
alyssa is dressed combing through wet hair when the sound of construction distracts her
she opens her window and sticks her head out
suddenly excited she pulls her head back in
sam is in bed as alyssa speeds out of the bathroom
there are like twenty people working on your dads house
alyssa bolts for the door but stops short as she faces sam
if it were my father id wanna spend every second with him i had left
sam doesnt face her doesnt even attempt to look up
you hate your father
if he tricked me into loving him is what i meant
youd hate him for the trick
not if what he left me was real
alyssa leaves closing the door behind her
sam stays put
colleen is talking to tom and barbara as they stand to the side of the house where a throng of men assemble the house
he pulled this crew off a tract in newport
theyre the best
robin pulls to a stop on the street and adam and ryan run out to gawk at all the workers
whats going on
i hired some help
colleen glances back as alyssa runs to join the group
who are all these people
i think hes still sleeping
robin walks to the garage door and knocks
robin knocks again before opening the door
guster is beside george on the floor
robin rushes in and kneels down
she presses her hand against georges cheek
youre still warm
georges eyes flutter open
robin leans down and kisses him on the cheek
george focuses on robin he tries to speak stops and tries again
finally in a weak voice we hear stop licking me
alyssa bursts into the house and rushes up the stairs
sam is sitting on the edge of the bed as alyssa enters
your dads going to the hospital
sam doesnt respond
alyssa holds out her hand as we hear the ambulance approach
i dont wanna go
he asked where you were
he wants you with him
i dont wanna go
sam is nearly pleading frightened to move
alyssa walks out
the siren stops
the front door closes
sam sits still
the house is coming together incredibly fast with all the workers
tom and barbara are supervising the crew
david dokos whips around the corner in his black mercedes and parks in his driveway rushing over as he yells
nothing is built until the board of adjustment hears the appeal
david is searching for george finally settling for tom
where is he
i should have reported you for tossing that piece of dog doo
toms face is flushed barbara calms him by grabbing his arm
tom lets not overreact now
david dokos stomps his feet and thrusts his fist into the air as a child might if he were overreacting
i want this fucking piece of shit construction stopped now and i want that goddamn roof ripped off and lowered and i dont care if i have to spend a
shit load of money to get it done
i will do it
tom and barbara simply stare at him in disbelief
david walks back to his house
tom turns to his wife
i want this house finished before he can stop it
tom rolls up his sleeves and walks toward the house to help
colleen and alyssa walk into the house listless both look tired and sad
alyssa enters the room walks into the bathroom
sam is gone
adam and ryan are sitting next to each other on the floor subdued tossing a ball to guster
the kitchen door opens and peter walks into the family room
adam is the first to notice but the last to react
ryan stands as guster barks
guster be quiet
peter has a growth of beard and is dressed in levis and a knit shirt he doesnt look like himself
you got a dog
its not ours
ive missed you guys
ryan is tough not giving an inch
peter stares at his sons ashamed that the question could be asked
adam stands and walks to this father takes his hand
ill tell mom youre here
george is asleep looking dead with tubes in his arms
we hear a bit of the song by warren zevon my shits fucked up
well i went to the doctor i said im feeling kind of rough he said ill break it to you son your shits fucked up
sam is alone on the roof in the fading light stringing party lights over the shingles and under the eves
robin couldnt look worse as she walks down the hall to the family room with ryan
peter is standing alone
ryan joins adam on the floor with guster
robin stops and stands ten feet from peter
i thought maybe
i know its late
but if youre hungry
the sun has set as sam stands at the edge of the cliff trying to garner the courage to jump
after the sound of a wave crashing against the cliff sam closes his eyes and leaps off the edge of the earth
alyssa is sitting on the edge of her bed as colleen stops beside the open door
are you doing okay
alyssa shakes her head no
colleen walks into the room and sits down beside her daughter
alyssa rests her head on her mothers shoulder
robin peter ryan and adam are in the middle of dinner as adam excitedly tries to explain all that he and his brother have accomplished
and we got to take all the old paint off all the doors and then george taught us how to stain everything and he even let me choose the color
i liked best
and he said he loved me
we did a lot of the wiring too
oh and i got to drill a hole into a board to put the wire through
ive never heard you so excited about anything
maybe you can come help us too
id like that
peter glances at robin
sam is still wet as he walks down the hall
we hear more of the warren zevon song
i had a dream ah shucks oh well now its all fucked up its shot to hell
sam enters the room as a nurse scurries to catch up
im afraid no ones allowed in here now
hes my dad
sam is staring at george who is either asleep or unconscious
the nurse finally relents and walks out
sam sits in a chair beside the bed and begins to cry
slowly georges arm slides out beyond the railing of the bed his hand open
sam does his best to stop crying
i brought you something
sam pulls out a pair of sunglasses from his shirt pocket
george shakes death and drugs away as he manages to open his eyes
weakly i dont wanna go sam
sam gently slides the sunglasses over his fathers eyes he rushes to the window and pulls the curtains back
can you see
sam walks back to the bed and pulls it toward the window stretching the cords and tubes to their limit
he grabs the remote and raises georges head
off in the distance against the backdrop of an endless black ocean georges house is seemingly on fire with lights
pain cant stop a smile
its almost done
george takes hold of sams hand with his own
they continue to stare at the lit house holding hands
the door opens and robin adam ryan and peter are greeted by guster who bounces around like a wired rabbit
go brush your teeth and get right into bed
adam runs to robin for a kiss then grabs peter with a hug
adam runs up the stairs guster right on his heels
ryan is staring at his father
do you know anything about building a house
i guess i could teach you some things
robin sneaks a quick kiss on ryans cheek as he heads for the stairs
after hes gone robin turns back to peter
i hardly recognize you with a beard
that was my plan
to be hardly recognizable to you as me
i feel in love with george again
peter nods something he already knows
ill see you tomorrow
theres a moment where its clear that peter doesnt want to leave and robin doesnt want him to leave but after the moment passes peter walks out and robin sits
down at the base of the stairs
colleen and alyssa are asleep together on the bed
sam is up on a ladder pounding copper nails into cedar shingles that face the house
alyssa runs across the grass
where are you
floating to catalina
sam steps off the ladder
alyssa wraps her arms around him
sam removes sleepy bugs from alyssas eyes before he kisses her
a police car stops in front of the house and kurt steps out
alyssa and sam turn to face him
he said he heard hammering
before kurt can answer david dokos storms out of his house and trudges toward them talking
my attorney is driving down from newport beach
if i hear one more nail being hammered i swear to god before this is all over ill end up owing this house
as sam is staring at david dokos a hint of recognition crosses his face
dokos says that your father missed his height envelope by six inches
he wants the entire roof taken off and lowered
wait a minute
a wave of fear rushes through david dokos thats instantly visible
do you drive a black mercedes
sam figures out why we knows david dokos from the aborted blowjob in the black mercedes
im going back to my house to wait for my lawyer
david starts to leave but sam stops him with are you sure we need lawyers
davids face is sheet white as he forces himself back around
because all were really talking about is six inches right
are you threatening me
what are you talking about
im sixteen years old
how could i possibly threaten you
david dokos stares at sam for a long time before glancing at kurt and his police uniform for just a second
would you like to help us finish the house mr
yes i would
what the fuck
everything happens for a reason
thats what my dad said
then you tell me what just happened
sam walks back to the ladder and hammer leaving kurt and alyssa confounded
david takes a step back
sam pounds in another shingle as david walks quickly back to his house
george is unconscious as robin enters and sits down beside him with a video camera
i found the last time you were happy
robin adjusts the viewfinder and presses play on the camera
george doesnt wake up
on the tiny screen we see a younger george in the ocean his arms wrapped around six year old sam he shields sam from the waves and kisses his sons
robin rests the camera on the bed as the video continues to play
she takes hold of georges hand and begins to weep as she presses her head on his chest
an envelope with robin and sams name on it rests on the nightstand beside the bed
twenty men along with tom and barbara alyssa and colleen sam and david dokos are painting installing windows floors or cabinets as the house begins to take its final shape
peter stops and steps out of his car as adam and ryan race for the house
its almost done
sam walks out the front door
do you guys feel like painting
i love red
thats my favorite color
adam and ryan walk into the house as sam focuses on peter who keeps his distance
you dont look like you
either do you
peter glances down at his work clothes
i thought i might be able to help but it looks like you have all you can handle
do you like red
peter nods hesitates for a moment before walking up the driveway to sam
georges bed is empty stripped of everything
robin is still sitting in a chair beside the bed a letter resting on her lap
a nurse stops at the door
are you sure we cant call anyone
robin shakes her head no
the nurse moves on
from the outside the house is finished windows in doors on roof shingled
the sun drops behind the house causing a halo of bright light to envelop it
most of the workers have gone home because most of the work is done
all the floor are hand scrapped cherry huge beams and wood planks lend a strength to the ceiling
the kitchen cabinets are in the bathrooms are complete
sam ryan alyssa adam and peter are the only ones left
outside we hear a car pull to a stop
adam and ryan run down the stairs
peter stops cleaning a brush and walks to the window as sam stands still
adam runs to robin and meets her mid yard with a hug
when does george get to come see his house
its so beautiful
adam and robin are staring at the house
ryan can see the strain on his mothers face
is george okay
all robin can do is shake her head no
sam backs away from the window
peter turns to face him
standing straight as he can being as brave as he can tears well in sams eyes as he softly shakes
peter walks to sam and wraps his arms around him
i always thought of myself as a house
i was always what i lived in
it didnt need to be big
it didnt even need to be beautiful
i just needed to be mine
i became what i was meant to be
i built myself a life
i built myself a house
sam clings to peter completely lost in sorrow
adam and ryan have their arms wrapped around their mother as we pull back and watch the sun set the sky off in dazzling hues of orange and red
robin is driving with sam beside her in a low middle income neighborhood in santa ana
sam is holding the letter
youre sure about this
you could keep it and rent it out
this is what he wants
i read the letter
you read the will
he wants you to keep it
to live in it some day
then maybe this isnt what he wants but this what he was hoping for
beat maybe its what i want
its clear to see that robins proud of sams decision
she checks an address on a piece of paper and pulls to a stop
sam steps out of the car holding the letter
sam is shaking slightly as he walks up the cracked concrete walk to the door
he rings the bell
twenty one years ago my father crossed a double line
he changed my life and the life of a little girl forever with that mistake
i just cant stop thinking about her
a woman in her mid twenties opens the door in her wheelchair
sam is very nervous as he reaches in his pocket and pulls out a set of keys
my father built you a house
the woman is confused as sam holds out the keys
the house is majestic in its setting among the trees and grass on the jagged just of rock that accepts the constant crash of ocean against it with a solid
this is where if you were a house you would want to be built
