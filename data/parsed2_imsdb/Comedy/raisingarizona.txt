b if window
href b b screenplay by ethan coen joel coen my name is h
with horizontal hatch lines
call me hi
a disheveled young man in a gaily colored hawaiian shirt is launched into frame by someone offscreen
he holds a printed paddle that reads no
the hatch marks on the wall behind him are apparently height markers
the first time i met ed was in the county lock up in tempe arizona
as his picture is taken
on the paddle nov
a day ill never forget
a bellowing male voice from offscreen dont forget the profile ed
it is mounted on a tripod
a pretty young woman in a severe police uniform peers out from behind it
turn to the right
what kind of name is ed for a pretty thing like you
short for edwinna
turn to the right
hi obliges but still looks at ed out of the corner of his eye
youre a flower you are
just a little desert flower
on his eye skewed profile
lemme know how those come out
as hi is escorted away from the camera toward his cell
at the far end of the corridor a huge con is sluggishly mopping the floor
i was in for writing hot checks which when businessmen do it is called an overdraft
im not complainin mind you just sayin there aint no pancake so thin it aint got two sides
now prison life is very structured more than most people care for
his pov of the mopping con tracking as he approaches and the mopping cons pov of hi as hi approaches
but theres a spirit of camaraderie that exists between the men like you find only in combat maybe
the mopping con snarls as hi passes grrrr
or on a pro ball club in the heat of a pennant drive
a ballplayer connects thwock for a home run and the crowd roars
panning a circle of men who sit facing each other in folding chairs
the pan starts on hi
in an effort to better ourselves we were forced to meet with a counselor who tried to help us figure out why we were the way we were
at this point the pan has reached the counselor an earnest bearded young man who straddles a folding chair with his arms folded over its back
he is addressing one of the cons why do you use the word trapped
the huge muscle bound black man with a shaved head is knitting his brow in consternation
why do you say you feel trapped in a mans body
he bites his lip thinking then in a resonant bass voice well sometimes i get the menstrual cramps real hard
three parole officers two men and a woman face hi across a table
have you learned anything hi
yessir you bet
you wouldnt lie to us would you hi
no maam hope to say
a beat up chevy pulls into the all night stores empty parking lot
i tried to stand up and fly straight but it wasnt easy with that sumbitch reagan in the white house
hi is getting out of the chevy in a hawaiian shirt holding a pump action shotgun
i dunno they say hes a decent man so
he primes the shotgun whoosh clack and heads for the store
maybe his advisers are confused
full face exposure of hi once again in front of the mug shot wall
turn to the right
hi obliges but shoots sympathetic glances at ed who is obviously upset wiping away tears and snuffling behind the camera
whats the matter ed
my fai ants left me
she said her fiancee had run off with a student cosmetologist who knew how to ply her feminine wiles
on his profile
he turns back to ed
dont forget his phone call ed
you tell him i think hes a damn fool ed
you tell him i said so h
and if he wants to discuss it he knows where to find me
as another police officer starts to lead him away in the maricopa county maximum security correctional facility for men
looking up through her tears as hi is led away
state farm road number thirty one tempe arizona
struggling to call back over his shoulder as he is firmly led out the door
ill be waiting
the door slams
as hi is once again escorted toward his cell
the mopping con is now in the middle background having worked his way about halfway up the corridor since last time we saw him
i cant say i was happy to be back inside but the flood of familiar sights sounds and faces almost made it feel like a homecoming
as hi passes
group is meeting again
most men your age hi are getting married and raising up a family
they wouldnt accept prison as a substitute
hi looks sheepish
would any of you men care to comment
two convicts sitting next to each other gale and evelle appear to be friends
but sometimes your career gotta come before family
work is whats kept us happy
yeah but doc schwartz is sayin you gotta accept responsibilities
i mean im proud to say i got a family
looking down from the ceiling
in the foreground lying on the top bunk hands clasped behind his head as he stares off into space is moses
moses is a gnarled elderly black con with wire rimmed spectacles
on the lower bunk also with hands clasped behind his head and staring off at the same spot in space is hi
i tried to sort through what the doc had said but prison aint the easiest place to think
an when they was no meat we ate fowl
an when they was no fowl we ate crawdad
an when they was no crawdad to be foun we ate san
you ate what
nodding we ate san
you ate sand
hi faces the same three parole officers across the same table
well boy you done served your twenty munce and seeing as you never use live ammo we got no choice but to return you to society
these doors goan swing wide
i didnt want to hurt anyone sir
hi we respect that
but youre just hurtin yourself with this rambunctious behavior
i know that sir
of a eleven parking lot at night deserted except for his car which sits untended its engine rumbling
now i dont know how you come down on the incarceration question
hi backpedals into frame with a shotgun and a bag of cash
whether its for rehabilitation or revenge
he spins and grabs his car door handle
he tries the back door
but i was beginning to think
as we hear the wail of an approaching siren hi takes it on the heel and toe
that revenge is the only argument makes any sense
on hi against the mug shot wall
turn to the right
dont forget his latents ed
we see his right hand being efficiently manipulated by eds two hands she is rolling each of his inked fingers into the appropriate space on an exemplar sheet
hear about the paddy wagon collided with the segment mixer ed
twelve hardened criminals escaped
eds hand lingers on top of his
his other hand enters to rest on top of hers
got a new beau
no hi i sure dont
hi slips a ring off his own finger and slides it onto eds
dont worry i paid for it
the surly mopping con has now worked his way up to the foreground
hi is being escorted past him to his cell
they say that absence makes the heart grow fonder and for once they may be right
halfway up the corridor hi points casually at the floor
you missed a spot
the mopping con turns to watch him recede
same high shot with moses on the top bunk hi on the lower
more and more my thoughts turned to ed and i finally felt the pain of imprisonment
an momma would frow the live crawdad in a pot of boiln water
well one day i decided to make my own crawdad
we begin to crane down to tighten on the absently staring hi
an i frew it in a pot forgettin to put in the water ya see
moses voice is mixing down as we lose him from frame
and it was like i was makin popcorn ya see
the joint is a lonely place after lock up and fights out
we are now very close on hi staring
when the last of the cons has been swept away by the sandman
the underside of the top bunk
a sudden flash whitens and fades to leave the image of ed smiling behind her camera softly supered on the underside of the bunk
he wearily turns his head to profile on the pillow and shuts his eyes
but i couldnt help thinking that a brighter future lay ahead a future that was only eight to fourteen months away
eyes closed he is illuminated by a flash
hi and the same three officers
got a name for people like you hi
that name is called recidivism
ree peat o fender
not a pretty name is it hi
no sir it sure aint
thats one bonehead name
but that aint me anymore
youre not just tellin us what we wanna hear
no sir no way
cause we just wanna hear the truth
well then i guess i am tellin you what you wanna hear
boy didnt we just tell you not to do that
over his shoulder as he strides toward a door marked processing and flings it open
it is the familiar booking room
ed looks up from her camera having just snapped a picture of another suspect against the hatched wall
im walkin in here on my knees ed a free man proposin
hi cocks a finger at the suspect
as she nervously frets at her white bridal gown in front of a mirror
and so it was
dont forget the boo kay ed
gazing earnestly into the camera
a congregation is seated behind her the brides side wearing police blues the grooms side hawaiian shirts
also staring into the camera
you bet i do
over their shoulders the minister
on the newlyweds smiling at the camera
on the newlyweds smiling at each other profile to the camera
in the middle of a vast expanse of desert
eds pa staked us to a starter home in suburban tempe
hi is working the drill press wearing goggles and sweat stained overalls
and i got a job drilling holes in sheet metal
next to him idly stands bud a veteran of the shop with a grimy face and a pair of goggles pushed up on his forehead
so we was doin paramedical work in affiliation with the state highway system not actually practicin yunderstand and me and bills patrollin down nine mile bill roberts
barking no not that motherscratcher
anyway were approachin the wreck and theres a spherical object arestin on the highway
he pauses to blow and pop a bubble with his chewing gum
and it dont look like a piece a the car
mostways the job was a lot like prison except ed was waitin at the end of every day
hi is scowling at his paycheck
behind the barred window a fat cashier grins
and a paycheck at the end of every week
gummint do take a bite dont she
hi sits in a lawn chair in front of the trailer
ed sits on his lap his arms around her
both are wearing sunglasses looking at the setting sun
the scene is suffused with a warm yellow light
these were the happy days the salad days as they say
as the sun sets the light is turning from yellow to amber
hi and ed watch their heads following its slow downward arc
and ed felt that having a critter was the next logical step
it was all she thought about
the amber is turning to a more neutral dusky light as the sun has set
hi and ed continue to stare at the point where it disappeared
her point was that there was too much love and beauty for just the two of us
the dusk is slipping away into darkness
and every day we kept a child out of the world was a day he might later regret having missed
we are by now holding on pitch black
from the darkness that was beautiful
ed is crossing off the last day on the calendar before a day circled in red
so we worked at it on the days we calculated most likely to be fruitful
hi is wearily entering after a long day at work clutching his lunchpail
and we worked at it most other days just to be sure
ed flies into frame and leaps into his arms covering him with kisses
in each others arms hi and ed roll over on the bed
seemed like nothing could stand in our way now
we pan with them rolling and continue off them to the night table on which sits a framed pair of photographs of hi probably taken by ed one shows him
full face the other in profile
ed sits in a lawn chair knitting a booty
hi stands in bermuda shorts and an unbuttoned hawaiian shirt hosing down the minuscule patch of front lawn
my lawless years were behind me our child rearin years lay ahead
a squad car its siren wailing kicks up dust as it roars into the foreground
hi and ed are seated on folding chairs facing an agents desk
hi wears a sport coat over his hawaiian shirt
ed is in her dress blues
its true ive had a checkered past but ed here is an officer of the law twice decorated
looking with a dead pan from the file to hi
so we figure it kind of evens out
his face still deadly neutral the agent looks back down at the file and unfolds the accordioned rap sheet revealing it to be a couple feet long
but biology and the prejudices of others conspired to keep us childless
on ed as she stares vacantly out the passenger window
our love for each other was stronger than ever
he looks from ed out to the road
but i preminisced no return of the salad days
over his shoulder as he stares listlessly at himself in the mirror a razor held forgotten in one hand his face half lathered and half shaved
the pizazz had gone out of our lives
the bedroom is somewhat messy
ed sits on the edge of the bed also staring listlessly
her police uniform is on but not yet buttoned
her hands lie palm up in her lap like two dead fish
ed lost all interest in both criminal justice and housekeeping
soon after she tendered her badge
once again hi works as his sweaty gum chewing colleague stands idly by
even my job seemed as dry and bitter as a hot prairie wind
so here comes bill a walkin down nine mile thats bill parker yunderstand got his sandwich in one hand the fuckin head in the other
alone in his chevy
he looks to the side
i even caught myself drivin by convenience stores
that werent on the way home
hi and ed sit listlessly watching tv
then one day the biggest news hit the state since they built the hoover dam
ed perks up reacting to something on tv
hi notices her reaction and also sloughs off his stupor to watch
the arizona quints was born
a newscaster silently reading copy
behind him news footage of five nurses holding infants mortices in
by arizona quints i mean they was born to a woman named florence arizona
eyes still locked on the set ed reaches her hand out to hi
eyes still locked on the set hi takes her hand in his
as you probably guessed florence arizona is the wife of nathan arizona
and nathan arizona well hell you know who he is
nathan arizona a stocky middle aged man in a white polyester suit is gesturing expansively with his white cowboy hat toward a one story warehouse store with a football stadium
parking lot chroma keyed in behind him
mixing up on the tv so come on down to unpainted arizona for the finest selection in fixtures and appointments for your bathroom bedroom beaudoir
the owner of the largest chain of unpainted furniture and bathroom fixture outlets throughout the southwest
and if you can find lower prices anywhere my name aint nathan arizona
as they slowly look from the tv set toward each other
hi lounges near one of the vending machines as a businessman puts in a quarter
yep florence had been taking fertility pills and she and nathan had hit the jackpot
the businessman takes his newspaper and releases the machine door as he turns to leave
hi snags the door before it closes and takes his own five finger discount copy
he flips the paper over to look at the headline
the banner headline of the tempe intelligencer is the subhead more than we can handle laughs dad
next to it is a picture of nathan
now yall whore without sin can cast the first stone
a pull back from the paper shows hi and ed reading it together at home
they look from the paper to each other
hi opens to an inside page and we pan a row of pictures the five tots with their names underneath harry barry larry garry and nathan jr
but we thought it was unfair that some should have so many while others should have so few
in the middle of the desert
it reads welcome to tempe
we are floating in toward ed who is seated waiting in the drivers seat of his chevy
hi enters frame and cinches down a ladder that is tied to the roof of the car
pieces of red flag flutter at either end of the ladder where it sticks out beyond the car
with the benefit of hindsight maybe it wasnt such a hot idea
hi gets in the car
it starts down the long winding road leading away from the trailer kicking up dust
but at the time eds little plan seemed like the solution to all our problems and the answer to all our prayers
the title of the film burns in raising arizona
a building chord snaps off in a shock cut to tableau of a couple at home
nathan arizona is on the telephone his stocking feet up on an ottoman
florence sits reading dr
spocks baby and child care
the living room is dominated by a large oil portrait of nathan and florence gazing out from the wall over the mantelpiece
into the phone eight hundred leaf tables and no chairs
you cant sell leaf tables and no chairs
chairs you got a dinette set
no chairs you got dick
i ask my wife she got more sense
from somewhere upstairs we hear an infant start to cry
florence stops reading and looks up at the ceiling
nathan is oblivious
miles all i know is im away from the office to have me some kids and everything goes straight to heck
i aint gonna stand for it
another title is supered below the first september
the baby stops crying and florences attention returns to her book
yeah and if a frog had wings he wouldnt bump his ass a hoppin
im sick of your excuses miles
it is now
as he throws out his wrist to look at his watch a third title is supered beneath the first two p
in the p
im gonna be down to the store in exactly twelve hours to kick me some butt
he starts to replace the receiver but brings it back with an afterthought or my name aint nathan arizona
as he slams the phone into the cradle the titles disappear
another baby starts crying
florence looks up at the ceiling
that sounds like larry
close on the crying baby as hi bounces it gently but desperately
he starts to lower it back into the crib
the crib is unpainted with the name of each baby burned bonanza style into the headboard harry barry larry garry and nathan jr
instead of quieting as he is lowered into the crib the squalling baby only sets off one of his brothers
hi hurriedly lifts him back out
he looks desperately around the room
the room is wallpapered with nursery rhyme characters
there are toys strewn around
there is one adult sized easy chair in the corner
hi carries the baby over to the chair stepping on and reacting to the squeal of a squeeze me toy on the way
he sits the baby deep in the chair and then returns to the crib to deal with the second crying baby
he lifts the baby out of the crib and gently bounces it
this baby stops crying
another one in the crib starts bawling
hi sets the second baby down on the floor and gives it a rattle to keep it pacified
he reaches for the third baby in the crib
sweat stands out on hi s brow
he is desperately chucking the third baby under the chin when we hear a muffled he whirls to look across the darkened room
the first baby has dropped off the easy chair and is energetically crawling away toward a shadowy corner
nathan and florence are sitting stock still staring at the ceiling
after a moment another baby starts crying
whatre they playing telephone
they stare at the ceiling
loose babies are crawling everywhere
hi is skittering across the room in a half crouch a baby tucked under one arm reaching out with the other as he pursues a crawling baby across the room
he hefts the other baby with his free arm and brings the air back to the crib
he turns to look frantically around the room
the other three babies have disappeared
there is perfect quiet
hi goes over to the closet door which is ajar and swings it open
he reaches under a moving pile of clothes on the floor and pulls out a baby
he returns it to the crib and freezes listening
the sound of a rattle
he drops to the floor to look under the crib
a baby holding a rattle leers into the camera in the foreground
behind him hi on his stomach is reaching in to grab at his leg
hi is pulling the baby out away from the camera when with a plop
a baby drops onto hi s back from the crib above
hi twists one arm back to grope for the baby crawling on top of him
he is straightening up a baby in each arm when he reacts in horror to something he sees across the room
the hindquarters of a diapered baby are just disappearing around the corner of the nursery door into the hallway
florence and nathan are staring at the ceiling
after a beat we hear a muffled plop
on the ceiling
a beat later the bleat of the squeeze me toy
whynt you go up and check on em
they sound restless
the floor level wide angle shot shows a baby crawling toward the camera in the foreground
behind him in the background just rounding the open door from the nursery yet another baby is making a mad dash for freedom
hi emerges from the nursery and stepping around the background baby trots toward the baby in the foreground
by the time he reaches it the low angle cropping shows us only his feet and calves
perspiring as he tiptoes the last two steps to the baby
the baby and beyond it the stairway down to the main floor
we hear footsteps approaching
he scoops up the baby and hurriedly tiptoes away toward the nursery
the baby at the nursery door in the foreground the staircase in the background
as hi reaches the baby we hear footsteps climbing the stairs
his free arm comes down into frame to scoop the baby up and out of frame just as florences head appears bobbing up as she climbs the stairs
she approaches the nursery still clutching the dr
as florence enters from the hallway door
we track back into the room on her as she approaches the crib
halfway there she freezes staring in shock
all of the babies have been replaced in the crib but not lying down they are seated in a row staring back at her lined up against the far crib
railing like a small but distinguished panel on meet the press
eds pov of hi approaching the car
he is shrugging and displaying a pair of manifestly empty hands
barely able to fight down her anger
hissing whats the matter
hi appears at her the drivers window
sorry honey it just didnt work out
he is reaching to open the door but she slaps his hand away from the handle
what dyou mean it didnt work out
they started cryin then they were all over me
he is trying to open the door which ed is holding shut with all her might
it was kinda horrifying lemme in honey
course they cried
i know that now
come on honey we better leave ed is rolling up the window and locking the door
you go right back up there and get me a toddler
i need a baby hi they got moren they can handle
muffled through the closed window and very forlorn aw honey i dont you come back here without a baby
florence is holding one of the babies cradled against her shoulder
she is facing the hallway door her back is to the crib and window
the baby peeping out over her shoulder is facing the window
of the window as his head appears in it
looking back he holds a finger to his lips
florence starts bouncing it patting it on the back
hi and the window bouncing up and down
nathan is leafing through the lingerie ads in the newspaper
we can hear florences returning footsteps
muttering christian dior my butt
they pay money for that
howre the kids
fuckin kids i love em
we hear the bleat of the squeeze me toy
florence and nathan look at the ceiling for a beat then nathan clears his throat and returns to the newspaper
ed sits anxiously waiting in the drivers seat peering intently through the windshield
as she catches sight of something she breaks into a broad smile unlocks the door and slides over to the passenger seat
hi is opening the door with one hand cradling a baby in the other
which one ya get
as he gets into the drivers seat i dunno
he hands her the infant then hands her the copy of dr
spocks baby and child care
heres the instructions
oh hes beautiful
hi nods as he pulls away from the curb
hes awful damn good
i think i got the best one
ed is gushing and kissing the baby through the rest of the conversation
i bet they were all beautiful

its like when i was robbin convenience stores ed suddenly bursts out crying
i love him so much

as the lights are thrown on
the room is hung with streamers
a string of cut out letters reads welcome home son

ed is entering with nathan jr

jovially hes all right he is
he reaches for the child

he takes the baby in both hands and holds him out at arms length pointing him at the various places of interest
the baby looks goggle eyed at each one
lookahere young sportsman
that theres the kitchen area where ma and pa chow down
over theres the tv two hours a day maximum either educational or football sos you dont ruin your appreciation of the finer things

well well just sit you right there boy
he is propping nathan jr
up in the corner of the couch
hi sits at the other corner and ed sits in a facing chair
just put those dogs upn take a load off
hi beams at nathan jr
ed smiles at nathan jr
looks from one to the other deadpan
they seem to be waiting for him to contribute to the conversation
suddenly hi slaps his knee
what are you kiddin

ed is getting up
hes a scandal honey
hes a little outlaw
as she picks up the baby hes a good boy
he aint too good
you can tell by that twinkle in his eye
dont you think we should put him to bed
hang on honey
he is frantically reaching for a polaroid camera
lets us preserve the moment in pictures
just one okay
she sits down on the couch with nathan jr
as hi starts screwing the camera into a tripod
i gotta tell ya im a little scared
absently as he sets up the camera how come is that honey
well we got a baby hi
its an awful big responsibility
as he peers through the lens honey could ya slide over a tad and raise the nipper up
as she complies i mean we never done this before and im kinda nervous
youre doin real good sugar
hi sits on the couch holding the cameras cable release
he puts his arm around ed and smiles at the offscreen camera
ed nestles her head against his shoulder
i love you hi
were set to pop here honey
youre gonna help arent ya
through his teeth as he continues to grin at the offscreen camera hows that honey
give nathan jr
a normal family background just quiet evenings at home together
we begin to hear distant thunder
you can count on it honey
everything decentn normal from here on out
as he squeezes the cable release flash the image momentarily freezes on hi beaming nathan jr
staring and ed looking at hi with a little bit of concern
the rolling thunder has built to a thunderclap at the cut and the flash of the polaroid match cuts to lightning throwing a momentarily harsh glare on the field
rain beats down on the bare patch of ground we are looking at by now just a patch of mud
faraway lightning flickers and we hear the rumble of more thunder approaching then suddenly thwack a head pops up out of the mud
it is gale the con we saw in group therapy
he bellows as lightning and thunder flash and crack nearby
his head is covered with mud although the driving rain is already starting to wash it away
we are beginning to track in an arc around gales head who is now struggling working to get his shoulders and arms up out of the mud
the end of the degree arc and a flash of lightning reveal way in the distance the wire topped walls of a penitentiary
still bellowing as if in some primal rage gale has gotten his muck covered arms up out of the earth and is now pushing down to haul up the rest
of his body
it comes with much effort and with the loud sucking popping sounds of the fiercely clinging mud
finally he is free
with a great cry the mud covered man plunges his right arm straight back down into the earth all the way up to his shoulder
he gropes intently and then apparently having grabbed hold of something underground he starts pulling
his arm comes slowly back up out of the mud
clasped in his hand is a human foot
bellowing with effort he continues to pull liberating the foot
torso of his companion and finally his head
as the rain starts to wash the mud off his companions head we see that it is his friend evelle
both are bellowing
mud sucks and pops
at the cut the ear splitting thunder drops out to quiet
we hear only the muffled patter of rain and the hum of a bare fluorescent
the two bedraggled escaped cons are standing side by side combing their hair in the mirror
the men seem absorbed in their task using hair jelly from a jar that sits on the shelf between them to restore their ducks ass haircuts
evelle cracks the bathroom door and looks out into the rain
what is it
the two men are trotting out to a mercury that sits untended at a gas island a gas hose on automatic stuck in its tank
as gale starts up the car evelle yanks the hose out and drops it to the ground
gale is already starting to peel out as evelle gets in
late at night
hi sits asleep on the sofa at the far end of the room in a pool of lamp light
we hear faint distant knocking
as we track in toward hi the knocking becomes louder and more present
as we approach hi we see that several polaroids are spread over his gently rising and falling chest
by the time we tighten on his face the knocking has become quite loud
hi starts awake with a grunt
open up in air
he looks up alarmed
the front door of the trailer
someone is pounding insistently
its a police
he sits up and tenses
he looks around
ed stands in her nightgown at the mouth of the hallway holding nathan jr
and squinting at hi
she hisses hi
whats goin on
po lice son
open her up
hi gets to his feet hurriedly tosses the polaroids under a cushion of the couch and takes out a gun
get in the bedroom
they aint gonna take nathan
well id like to see em fly
as ed turns back to the bedroom open up and maybe well letcha plea bargain
as ed enters and shuts the door
she listens hard at the door his footsteps cross the living room the click of the door opening silence
a burst of raucous male laughter
come on out here
want you to meet a couple friends of mine
as ed enters carrying nathan jr
all three men hi gale and evelle are beaming at her
honey like you to meet gale and evelle snopes fine a pair as ever broke and entered
gale roars with laughter
boys this heres my wife
ed smiles politely then squints at hi
kind of late for visitors isnt it hi
well yeah honey but these boys tell me they just got outta the joint
gotta show a little hospitality
gale is admiring the baby
well now h

hi and ed look at each other uncomfortably
hi clears his throat
well so far we just been using junior

gale is staring at the streamers and decorations
reading aloud welcome

i thought yer folks was dead h
very uncomfortably well we thought junior should see their final resting place whynt you boys have a seat
as the two men move toward the couch ed hesitantly pipes up hi its two in the morning
she wrinkles her nose

apologetically we dont always smell like this miz mcdunnough
i was just explainin to yer better half here that when we were tunneln out we hit the main sewer dumb luck that and just followed that to you mean
you busted out of jail
we released ourselves on our own recognizance
what evelle means to say is we felt the institution no longer had anything to offer us
he is looking at the baby

gale evelle and hi look up at ed dumbstruck
after a beat maam
you just cant stay
i appreciate your bein friends of hi and all but this is a decent family now
she looks at hi
i mean we got a toddler here
gale leans in close to hi a look of sincere concern on his face and says under his breath say who wears the pants round here now honey dont you
now you boys can set a while and catch up and then youll be on your way
there is an awkward silence as she leaves and slams the bedroom door
gale is carefully studying his thumbnail evelle stares fixedly at the ceiling
still looking at his thumb gotcha on a awful short leash dont she h
sometime later as hi tiptoes in
ed lies in bed facing the wall we see only the back of her head
hi sits gingerly on the edge of the bed and smiling sticks a finger through the bars of the crib to play with the baby
the sound of the tv set in the living room filters faintly in
they still here
hi is momentarily startled then goes on playing with the baby
yeah theyre just gonna stay a day or two
its raining out honey they got nowhere to go
ed finally turns to face him
we hear the two men laugh raucously in the living room
theyre fugitives hi
hi turns to face her
howre we gonna start a new life with them around
well now honey you gotta have a little charity
ya know in arab lands theyd set out a plate promise just a day or two
tonight and tomorrow tops
looking straight down at hi asleep in bed
it is later filtering softly in from the other room is the end of the star spangled banner on tv
we are craning down
that night i had a dream
for a brief moment we see a wall of flames and hear it roar
still craning down
id drifted off thinkin about happiness birth and new life
wall of flames
the faint national anthem ends we hear the weeeeeeee of a test pattern
but now i was haunted by a vision of roaring
at the cut whooooosh
a huge low rider motorcycle bursts through the flames its engine roaring even louder than the fire
its driver is a huge leather clad hellion
the chains worn by the biker clank ominously as he rides
he was horrible
the biker roars out of frame
as the biker roars into frame his rear tire laying down a wake of fire
a lone biker of the apocalypse
as he roars along a ribbon of desert highway
a man with all the powers of her at his command
the biker reaches for his bullwhip
he could turn the day into night
the biker cracks the whip and at the crack the sky behind him turns instantly to black
bolts of lightning crackle across it as thunder roars
tracking with and also in on the biker from behind as he roars along a strip of highway
he is reaching for the two sawed off shotguns which are strapped crisscross across his back
and laid to waste everything in his path
pulling the biker from a distance as he levels the two shotguns
the tracking camera pulls back further to reveal a running jack rabbit keeping pace with us in the foreground
he was especially hard on the little things
crack as the first shotgun spurts orange the foreground rabbit keels over
the biker slues the other gun around
on a rock in the foreground a desert lizard suns himself
the biker is approaching in the distant background
the helpless and the gentle creatures
crack from afar the foreground lizard is blown away
of the empty desert road stretching away
in the foreground a lone desert flower blooms
the biker roars into frame
he left a scorched earth in his wake befouling even the sweet desert breeze that whipped across his brow
as the biker roars away the foreground flower bends with his draft and then bursts into flame
from in front
he twirls the shotguns in either hand and reaches back to plunge them over his shoulders into their holsters
i didnt know where he came from or why
we are moving in on his chest where two crisscrossed bandoliers carry two rows of hand grenades their silver pins glinting in the sun
we follow the line of one of the bandoliers up to his right shoulder which bears the tattoo mama didnt love me
i didnt know if he was dream or vision
from behind booming down as we track
we are approaching the crest of a rise
but i feared that i myself had unleashed him
of the biker approaching craning down as he draws near
for he was the fury that would be
with the crane down we momentarily lose him from view over the rise then suddenly roar he tops the rise and wheels spinning is airborne as he crashes back down
to earth in the foreground and roars away
only now we are no longer in the desert we are looking down a twilight street at the end of which is the arizona house
as soon as florence arizona found her little nathan gone
the roar of his engine and clank of his chains recede as the biker gradually dissolves into thin air
we are left looking at the empty street and the faraway arizona house
the receding roar has left behind eerily beautiful singing a woman singing a lullaby
faintly behind the singing there is also a droning high pitched noise
the camera starts floating forward very close to the ground moving slowly toward the arizona house
the high pitched drone is becoming less faint under the singing
the camera is accelerating
the drone is growing louder we can now tell that it is a human scream
as we approach the arizona house we can see that a ladder is propped up to a second story window
we are moving quite fast now
the scream all but buries the singing
we are rushing toward the house toward the base of the ladder the sustained scream drawing us on
we hurtle toward and then straight up the ladder with no abatement of speed sucked forward by the deafening scream
we reach the top and hurtle thwap
through the white curtains of the open second story window into the nursery to reveal florence arizona her back to us screaming over the crib
we are rocketing toward her
she is turning to us hands pressed to her ears mouth stretched wide in an ear splitting shriek and we are rushing into an extreme close up of her gaping
mouth and her wildly vibrating epiglottis and we as they snap open
the screaming snaps off at the cut
the singing that the building scream covered however is now audible again
perspiration beads his forehead
he looks down toward the foot of the bed
it is now morning
ed walks back and forth gently bouncing the baby as she walks
she is singing it a lullaby
faintly from the next room we can hear gale and evelle snoring away like buzz saws
groggily he all right
hes all right
he was just havin a nightmare
hi is getting out of bed
he crosses to the bedroom window and cracks the venetian blind
orange light filters in
beyond a clothes line and a septic tank a huge orange ball of sun is rising
we can almost hear the roar of its burning surface
sometimes its a hard world for little things
the orange sun rumbling perceptibly rising
at the cut the rumble of the sun is snapped off by the high pitched ba weeeeeeee
of a strobe going off as a flash picture is taken we are looking over nathan jr
s shoulder as he stands at his open front door facing a battery of press people who stand out on the porch
an obie light over a local tv news camera glares in at us various flashbulbs pop
no the missus and the rest of the kidsve left town to i aint sayin where

yeah watch yer butt
sir its been rumored that your son was abducted by ufos

sadly now dont print that son
if his mama reads that shes just gonna lose all hope
a policeman from inside the house is taking nathan by the elbow
we really have to ask you some more questions sir
as nathan allows himself to be led back into the house he calls back over his shoulder but remember its still business as usual at unpainted arizona and if you
can find lower prices anywhere my name still aint nathan arizona
we are following the two hand held as the police leads nathan toward the living room
the room is filled with policemen milling about in several different uniforms local police state troopers plainclothes detectives
the original policeman is leading nathan to a table where a white smocked technician is preparing inkpad and exemplar sheets
the dialogue is urgent rapid fire and overlapping
byrum here can take your exemplars while you talk
byrum has taken nathans right hand and is rolling its fingers onto the inkpad
just let your hand relax ill do the work
nathan jerks his hand away
what is this
i didnt steal the damn kid
two men in conservative suits are approaching

nathan bellows back get your feet off mdamn coffee table
also raising his voice at the offscreen bellower ron youre upsetting the victim
nathan is getting worked up
damnit are you boys gonna go chase down your leads or are you gonna sit drinkin coffee in the one house in the state where i know my boy aint
sir there arent any leads yet aside from this coat gimme that
he grabs the overcoat being displayed by fbi
thats a five hundred dollar camels hair sir you might want to wash your hands at this point
nathan realizes that hes gotten ink from his fingerprinting all over the coat
he is rising to his feet and hurling the coat to the floor
he furiously kicks the coat
everyone leaves microbesn whatnot
throughout the speech nathan stalks the room working himself into a frenzy furiously putting coffee cups onto coasters generally cleaning up hectoring the police and swiping their feet off his
hell thats your forte trackin down them microbes left by criminalsn commiesn shit
thats yer whole damn raison ditre
i want nathan jr
back or whichever the hell one they took
hes out there somewhere
somethin leads to him
and anyone can find him knows the difference between a lead and a hole in the ground
specifically it is the hole in the muddy patch of earth that gale and evelle climbed out of
we hear only the squish suck of many feet walking around in the mud offscreen
we are pulling back to reveal the feet the shiny black patent leather shoes and blue pants cuffs becoming quickly spattered of several policemen milling about the hole
german shepherds sniff around also
with a roar motorcycle wheels enter frame
the bikes jackbooted rider casually tools around the hole once police step back and dogs skitter away to give him room
he backs toward the camera and stops standing astride the bike
the burning stub of a cheroot is dropped into frame it hisses angrily and dies in the mud
we start to crane up
the whipcracking biker cue mixes up
the bikers motorcycle idles with a deep rumble like the roar of fire on the sun
we are now framed looking over the bikers shoulder
the policemens attitude to him seems to be deferential
one cop in front of him is pointing a direction
the biker is shaking his head he doesnt think they went that way
suddenly with a loud whipcrack effect the bikers head snaps to profile
he is staring across the field stock still having heard smelled or sensed something
the dogs milling around the hole also react snapping to attention a split second after the biker
a jackrabbit is bounding away at the far end of the field
after a moment their attention returns to the hole
his attention also returns to the matter at hand
he squints concentrating
his bike rumbles
gradually his face sets in a specific direction
we pan down to the tattoo on his shoulder mama didnt love me
his shoulder flexes once or twice as he revs the throttle then he puts the bike in gear and it roars out of frame
they are both intently munching cornflakes staring at something offscreen
after a beat awful good cereal flakes miz mcdunnough
ed is sitting in the living room bottle feeding nathan jr
she is surrounded by the rumpled sheets and blankets used by the house guests
she does not respond to the ice breaker
gale puts his spoon down and picks up a cigarette which has been smoking in the ashtray next to him
there is a bead of milk dribbling down his chin
he takes a contemplative puff studying ed
whyncha breast feed him
you pear to be capable
mind your own bidnis
through a mouthful of cornflakes ya dont breast feed him hell hate you for it later
thats why we wound up in prison
gale blows out smoke and picks up his spoon to start back in on his cornflakes
anyway thats what doc schwartz tells us
hi is walking in yawning
sharply as hi sits and starts to pour cornflakes into a bowl hi
hi holds the cornflakes box arrested in mid air
he looks at ed who is motioning to gale and evelle with her eyes
say boys you wouldnt mind makin yourself scarce for a couple hours this afternoon
were havin some decent friends over
gale and evelle are looking dumbly from ed to hi
what ed means to say is seein as you two boys are wanted it wouldnt exactly do to have folks seein you here i mean for your own protection
anything you say
more relaxed now to ed matter of fact honey maybe ill skip this little get together myself glen wont mind and ill just duck out with the boys knock back
a couple of uh co colas sure h
wed love to have ya
looking pleadingly at hi
feeling the look he goes back to his cornflakes
maybe that aint such a hot idea either
gale leans back to blow smoke at the ceiling
bitterly so many social engagements
so little time
it is the bathroom where we earlier saw gale and evelle combing their hair now empty
we are looking toward the door
the bathroom is quiet except for the dripping sink and the faint rumble of an approaching motorcycle
it grows louder then begins to recede as the bike shoots by the station
suddenly we hear the screech of the bikes brakes
we are on the road outside the gas station as the motorcycle screeches to a halt in the foreground
the low wide shot crops the biker at his shins
in the background behind him is the gas station
the biker pauses for a moment thinking or feeling
we hear the rumble of the bike approaching very loud
crash the bathroom door flies open as the biker bursts in astride his hog bright daylight streaming in with him to throw him into imposing silhouette
the shafts of light pouring in are defined by motes of dust dancing in the air
fast track in on the jar of hair jelly sitting on the shelf under the mirror
an extreme close shot shows his nostrils dilating as we hear him sniff
he revs the rumbling bike stealing thunder from a far mountain
hi with ed standing by is just opening the door to a young couple
glen is a short stocky blond man in his early thirties wearing bermuda shorts
dot is wearing slacks heels and a scarf over her hair
glen dot as the door opens dot hops up the stoop shrieking
wheres at baby

from behind glen gives her an energetic thwok on the ass
go find him honey
dot spins and smacks glen across the face with her purse
through clenched teeth cut it out glen
he reels under the blow
quietly hes asleep right now
dot shrieks again but this time muffles it with her own hand
she tiptoes into the trailer hand to her mouth
glen rubbing his cheek seems angry at himself

glen at the top of the stoop turns out to the yard
come on kids
a scad of children ranging in age from two to seven are crawling over his car

she puts her hand to her forehead reacting to the baby as if she is about to faint
hes an angel
she hides her face in her hands and looks away as if blinded then sneaks a look around her hands
hes an angel straight from heaven
now honey i had all my kids the hard way so you gotta tell me where you got this angel
did he fly straight down from heaven
well you gonna send him to arizona state
the weaving knee level tracking shot is following a six year old boy in shorts and a dirty t shirt as he tramps around the trailer brandishing a big stick
he strikes the walls furniture various other objects with his stick hollering bam
with each blow
the track weaves off him and onto hi who is bending down to pull a couple of beers from the refrigerator
he raises his voice to make himself heard over the din of all the children boiling around the room need a beer glen

the sound of shattering glass
glen looks around

dot faces hi and ed across a picnic table covered with grilled hamburgers rolls green jello mold cooler etc
one of the younger children sits in the middle of the table occasionally taking a fistful of jello and flinging it at hi
the two women dont seem to notice
and then theres diphtheria tetanus what they call dip tet

we are tracking on hi and glen as they walk side by side
glen is sopping wet wearing only swimming suit and wing tipped shoes
his body is ghostly pale except for a v area at his neck and his arms below the short sleeve line which are a bright angry red
hear about the person of the polish persuasion he walks into a bar holdin a pile of shit in his hands says look what i almost stepped in

glen is eyeing him shrewdly

he stops walking
hi stops also looking at glen still puzzled
glen lays a companionable hand on his shoulder
now the thing about dot is she thinks and shes told me this he looks around as if to make sure they are not being overheard
his tone is confidential
hi looks suspiciously at glens hand on his shoulder
glen nods energetically im crappin you negative

through tightly clenched teeth whatre you talkin about glen
whatm i talkin about

beaming he takes his hand off his shoulder and spreads his arms
im talkin about the sex revolution
im talkin about thwak his fist swings into frame to connect solidly with glens jaw
glens feet leave the ground
he flies back and lands in a heap
glen in the foreground groggily rubbing his jaw hi approaching menacingly
keep your goddamned hands off my wife
he is scrambling to his feet
i was only tryin to help
keep your goddamned hands off my wife
with hi still advancing glen starts to run
with hi pursuing in the background
glen is looking back over his shoulder to shout at hi as he runs
i feel pity for you man
glen runs smack into a tree and drops like a sack of cement
hi is driving his jaw rigidly set his temple throbbing
sits in a safety seat between him and ed
we finally go out with some decent people and you break his nose
that aint too funny hi
stolidly his kids seemed to think it was funny
well theyre just kids youre a grown man with responsibilities
whatever possessed you
he was provokin me when i popped him
howd he do that
but hi hes your foreman hes just gonna fire you now
i expect he will
and where does that leave me and nathan jr
with a man for a husband
he is pulling into a convenience store parking lot
that aint no answer
honey thats the only answer
he puts the car in park but leaves it running
nathan needs some huggies
ill be out directly
as he gets out of the car mind you stay strapped in
a hand enters to take a package of panty hose from the standing rack
a hand enters to take a big carton of disposable diapers from the shelf
a pimply faced lad with a paper eleven cap on his head
he is looking up from a dirty magazine reacting in horror to something approaching
hi is approaching the check out island with a gun in one hand the carton of huggies tucked under the other
the leggs stocking is pulled over his head to distort his features
ill be taking these huggies and whatever cash you got
as he presses a silent alarm under the lip of his counter
ed is reading to nathan jr
from a large picture book
not by the hair of my chinny chin chin
then ill huff and ill puff
she pauses for a moment listening
we can barely hear a distant siren
she resumes absently but her voice trails off
and ill blow your house in
we can definitely hear the whoo whoo of the siren now and it is definitely approaching
ed hooks an arm around the seat and looks behind the car then looks forward
indistinctly visible through the semi reflective glass are two figures at the check out island
one is pointing something at the other
as the siren is growing louder
under her breath that son of a bitch
she unstraps herself and gets out of the car
two shot of hi and the cashier who is stuffing bills into a grocery bag
beyond them we can see ed outside circling the front of the car
her shout is muffled through the glass you son of a bitch
with this hi notices her
he turns to the cashier
better hurry it up
im in dutch with the wife
but ed is already getting into the drivers seat of the car
as she slams the car door shut
the siren is quite loud now
that son of a bitch
hang on pumpkin
the car squeals out of the lot
the squad car tops a rise to bounce into view its siren wailing
hi bursts out the door still wearing the stocking
the carton of huggies is still tucked under one arm
bellowing hopefully after his departing car honey
we hear the smack crack of a gunshot and glass impact but the approaching squad car is still too far down the block to have been the source
hi looks around the parking lot bewildered
the wailing siren is becoming painfully loud
hi looks behind him at the plate glass front of the store where a bullet pock mars the glass
through the glass we see the pimply young cashier with the paper eleven cap pop up from behind the counter to sight down his huge
magnum for another shot
the gun is so big he uses both hands to heft it
smack crack the bullet kisses another hole in the glass
hi is off and running
the squad car is screeching into the lot
an officer tumbles out of the passenger side before the car is fully stopped
he rolls on the pavement then hurriedly rights himself and takes up a half kneeling shooting stance
at the same time the little cashier is emerging from the eleven with his gun
the two bang away at his retreating figure the policemans revolver popping the cashiers magnum booming
we hear the policeman who is still in the car drawling over its loudspeaker halt
its a police warning son
put those groceries down and turn yourself in
legs pumping panty hose still over his head its unused leg streaming behind him like an aviators scarf
the gun is tucked into his belt the huggies are tucked securely under his arm
behind him we can see the officer and the cashier squeeze off another couple shots and then the policeman piles back into the squad car
she hears distant gunshots
that son of a bitch
hold on nathan
were gonna go pick up daddy
she hangs a vicious u turn
huffing and puffing down the road with his huggies
the cop car careens onto the street in the background its siren wailing
the passenger cop is leaning far out his window one hand gripping the light and siren rack the other pointing a gun at hi shooting away
bullets whizz past
suddenly with a soft pthunk
the huggies box pops forward out from under his arm hit by a bullet
still running hi reaches forward tries to catch it on the fly bobbles it tips it loses it
he overruns it a couple steps before he can bring himself up short
he turns and reaches to pick up the box but ping ping bullets chew up the road near his hand
leaving the huggies hi takes off through a well manicured yard
the police car is proceeding on down the street to catch him around the corner the driver still drawling over his loudspeaker thats private property son
come back out to the street and reveal yourself to officer steensma and officer scott thats me
hi vaults a fence to land in the backyard
as he straightens to his feet we hear a horrible snarling and barking
a huge black doberman is bounding across the lawn
it looks like it means to rip his throat out
the dogs racing pov as it bounds toward the paralyzed hi
the dog leaps camera flying up toward his face and the dogs slavering muzzle flies into frame and stops bare inches from his nose and the dog falls back having
reached the end of his chain
hi resumes running
on the dog snarling and straining against the end of his chain
down along the chain toward the spike mooring it to the ground
as the dog strains the spike starts to stir in the ground
other dogs can be heard barking now the doberman having started a sympathetic wave
her jaw set she takes a hard turn looking this way and that
that son of a bitch
the police car approaches and roars by the passenger cop still hanging out his window
lookie nathan a police car
she is looking in her rearview mirror
say that looks like bill steensma
the camera is shooting forward at ground level following the doberman as it bounds along
the doberman is dragging his chain and spike which stretch into the foreground bumping and scraping along the road
far ahead we can see hi running then turning down an intersecting street
a second dog peels into the road to bound along with the doberman
running up a dark street
there is an oncoming pickup
hi runs directly at it
the driver screams and brakes not quite in time
hi rolls onto the hood and off and gamely trots over to open the passenger door
the driver is leaning over to tell him son you got a panty on your head
just drive fast
he is displaying his gun as he starts to climb in
and dont stop till i tell ya
before hi can get his door shut the driver is obediently peeling out
hi is reacting to an oncoming car
he peels the stocking off to look and leans across the drivers lap to bellow as eds car passes honey
hi turns to look through the back window
eds car is braking and spinning into a u turn
leaning out the window
mind the baby now
next to him the driver is screaming
as hi turns forward the entire windshield explodes in
the pimply faced cashier from the eleven is standing in the middle of the road ahead sighting down his
magnum for another shot
we are rushing in
ready to fire and thump he is bowled over by the arriving doberman still trailing chain and spike and now accompanied by three other dogs all braying at the top
of their lungs
still screaming the driver puts his body into a hard right turn to avoid the cashier and hellhounds
roaring up the new street they are now directly in the path of the oncoming police car its siren wailing barreling straight at them
still screaming the driver leans into another hard right
wind is whistling in through where the windshield used to be
two wheels hop curb as the car skids into the new street fishtails and roars away
she hears dogs siren squealing brakes on an adjacent street
hold on nathan well take a shortcut
she gives the wheel a hard right turn
but there is no cross street
the car hops the curb and roars up someones nicely tended front yard heading for the gap between this house and the one next door
recovered and turned around from its near collision with the screaming driver the squad car is now squealing onto the street the screamer swerved on to resuming pursuit
as the police car roars down the street eds car appears from between two houses behind it bounces down the front yard to the street and follows the police
raking two shot of hi and the screamer
hi is looking back over his shoulder at the pursuing police
desperately pleading can i stop now
hi looks forward
they are rushing toward an imposing colonial house planted at the end of the dead end street
maybe you better
stepped on hard
the brakes scream
as the car squeals to a halt hi is catapulted through where the windshield used to be tumbling over the hood onto the front lawn
he rolls to his feet and as he runs up the lawn calls back over his shoulder thank you
we are tracking behind hi as he runs up to the house and crashes through the screen door
still tracking behind him as he runs through the living room
a middle aged couple sits on the couch watching tv
they look up as hi rushes by
hi plunges down a staircase
as he does so we hear ka chick ka chock ka chick ka chock
he emerges into a rec room where he and we rush past two kids playing ping pong
he runs out the back door
as he runs into the house
as he runs through the living room we catch a glimpse of the middle aged couple gaping at him
officer steensma plunges down the stairs
outdoors now running crossing the street behind the house and entering the parking lot of a supermarket on the other side
as a pack of dogs thunders in
the lead doberman with chain and spike has now picked up about a dozen neighborhood dogs
the dogs thunder through the living room and down the stairs
as they hit the rec room the thunder of their feet turns into the clatter of nails on tile
as hi bursts in
tracking on him as he runs down the broad front aisle head whipping as he runs looking up each perpendicular lane searching for something
he turns up one of the last lanes races along it and grabs a carton of huggies still on the flat run
he emerges into the broad back aisle and runs along it but at the first perpendicular lane he hits we see officer steensma gun leveled at the other end
hi keeps running
the policeman is running along the front aisle keeping pace with hi running along the back aisle
he squeezes off shots at hi as each lane gives him the opportunity
hi abruptly stops between lanes and doubles back losing the policeman
he runs down the second lane he comes to toward the front of the store
the pack of dogs appears at the end of the lane and thunders up toward hi braying at the top of their doggy lungs
the lead doberman holds in his teeth a paper eleven cap
hi reverses again and emerges into the back aisle
a pyramid of cranberry juice explodes at his shoulder
the policeman has been waiting at the end of the back aisle he aims once again
hi plunges down the next lane but is brought up short as ka boom
five jars of applesauce explode in front of him
standing in the raised platform cubicle at the front of the store is the store manager a fat man in a white short sleeved shirt with a lit cigarette dangling
from his mouth
the manager cracks open his shotgun and inserts two more cartridges thoonk thoonk in the smoking chamber
hi doubles back once again toward the back aisle
he is still several paces from the end of the lane when the policeman appears there squaring to face him
the policeman is in front of him
the manager is blowing out groceries on the shelves behind him
as he coolly levels his police special and takes aim at hi
still on the dead run hi is flinging the carton of huggies
the carton rockets straight at the camera
futilely raising his gun to avoid impact the huggies catch him square on the chest
the force makes him stumble one fatal step backwards into the back aisle where crash he is hit broadside and bowled over by a rocketing shopping cart propelled by an
hysterically screaming shopper
racing on down the back aisle bellowing
tracking from in front
beyond her we can see the pack of furiously barking dogs nipping at her heels
they boil over the prostrate officer steensma and this is the last we see of him in this movie
as hi emerges through the back door
ed is just skidding around the corner
hi scrambles in the passenger side
raking two shot with hi in the foreground
the car peels out of the lot
thank you honey you really didnt have to do this thwak ed gives him a good hard slap and his head rolls toward the camera
you son of a bitch
youre actin like a mad dog
rubbing his jaw turn left honey
still at top speed she leans into a hard left tires squealing
what if men the babyd been picked up
would a been accessory to armed robbery
nawww honey it aint armed robbery if the gun aint loaded what kind of home life is this for a toddler
youre supposed to be an example
now honey i never postured myself as the three piece suit type turn left dear
we got a child now everythings changed
well nathan jr
accepts me for what i am and i think you better had too
you know honey im okay youre okay
that theres what it is
i know but honey see i come from a long line of frontiersmen and here it is turn here dear frontiersmen and outdoor types
his eyes are fixed on something in the road ahead
im not gonna live this way hi
it just aint family life
his attention is still on the road
he is opening his door even though the car is still racing along
he absently concedes well
it aint ozzie and harriet
in the extreme foreground sits the first carton of huggies that hi dropped in the middle of the road
the car is approaching
as the car passes the carton his hand reaches from the passenger door and snags it
as hi pulls the carton in and slams his door shut
crane up in the car speeding away
as ed bursts in the front door holding nathan jr
you two are leaving
they look up dumbstruck and mortified from the sofa where the have been watching tv
now i got nothing against you personally
gale and evelle look appealingly toward hi who shifts uncomfortably behind ed
but youre wanted by the authorities and youre a bad influence in this household in my opinion
we sure didnt mean to influence anyone
and if we did we apologize
ed is unmoved
im goin in to town tomorrow to see about some shots for the baby
when i come back you better be gone or ill kick you out myself
she storms into the bedroom and slams the door
there is an awkward silence as gale studies his thumb and evelle stares at the ceiling
finally evelle turns to hi
whats he need his dip tet
im awful sorry boys but when ed gets mad you know when she gets an idea
well there aint a thing to apologize for h
he looks at evelle
it seems pretty clear what the situation is here
yeah i guess the missus wants us to clear out
youll pardon me for sayin so but i get the feelin that this here
his gesture seems to take in the trailer and the entire domestic situation
aint exactly workin out
well now eds generally a real sweetheart i and as per usual i wouldnt be surprised if the source of the marital friction was financial
well matter of fact i did lose my job today come on hi
youre young you got your health what do you want with a job
but look id rather light a candle than curse your darkness
as you know evellen i never go anywhere without a reason
and here we are in your little domicile
we come to invite you in on a score
a bank hi
hi is shaking his head
aw boys i dont i know youre partial to convenience stores but h
the sun dont rise and set on the corner grocery
its like doc schwartz says you gotta have a little ambition
why we just heard on the news how somebody snatched off one of the arizona babies
now theres someone thinkin big
and here you are sittin around on your butt playin house with a dont get me wrong h
with a fine woman but a woman who needs the button down type
well now that aint really any of your just lookahere
he is handing hi a folded up picture
picture of el dorado hi
though the locals call it the farmers and mechanics bank of lagrange
looks like a hayseed bank and tell you the truth it is a hayseed bank
except the last friday of every financial quarter theres more cash in that bank than flies at a barbecue
and guess what day it is tomorrow
ya see h
its when the hayseeds come in to cash their farm subsidy checks
a one information
got it in the joint from a guy named lawrence spivey one of dick nixons undersecretaries of agriculture
hes in for solicitin sex from a state trooper
ordinarily we dont associate with that class of person but
he was tryin to make brownie points with some of the boys
boys i cant we need someone handy with a scatter gun to cover the hayseeds while we get the cash
if this works out its just the beginning of a spree across the entire southwest proper
we keep goin till we can retire or we get caught
either way were fixed for life
hi is still shaking his head
boys its a kind offer but youre suggesting i just upn leave ed
now thatd be pretty damn cowardly wouldnt it
think about it h
seems to me stayin here yaint doin her any good
and yaint bein true to your own nature
the camera has floated in to a close shot of hi staring glumly at gale
following it very close we see only its rear wheel and fender and twin exhaust pipes one on either side
flame is boiling in each exhaust pipe as the hog roars
from behind the bikers head as he rides through the night
with the sharp whipcrack effect he suddenly looks left searching
with a second whipcrack effect he suddenly looks right still searching
he banks into a turn
late at night
we are tracking in toward the one window that is illuminated with a feeble yellow light
in voice over hi is composing a letter
my dearest edwinna
tonight as you and nathan slumber my heart is filled with anguish
creeping in on hi s hunched back as he sits over the kitchen table writing the letter
the yellow lamp sitting on the table is the only light on in the trailer
i hope that you will both understand and forgive me for what i have decided i must do
by the time you read this i will be gone
creeping in on gale and evelle sprawled on the sofa and easy chair respectively sawing boards
i will never be the man that you want me to be the husband and father that you and nathan deserve
still creeping in
maybe its my upbringing maybe its just that my genes got screwed up i dont know
creeping in on the pimply faced cashier sitting asleep behind the counter a dirty magazine lying face down open on his chest
but the events of the last day have showed amply that i dont have the strength of character to raise up a family
we are slowly panning over to the newspaper rack revealing tomorrows headline where is nathan jr
in the manner befitting a responsible adult and not like the wild man from borneo
creeping in on nathan jr
in the living room asleep in his ottoman armchair lit only by the snow from the tv set he is facing a half full glass of milk on the coffee
table next to him
his robe is disheveled his eyeglasses have slid down his nose
i say all this to my shame
creeping in on ed and nathan jr
asleep together in the double bed
eds arm is draped protectively over the sleeping infant
i will love you always truly and deeply
but i fear that if i stay i would only bring bad trouble
we start to hear the rumble of the motorcycle mix up again
on the heads of you and nathan jr
the motorcycle tire enters frame as the bike comes to a halt
the biker plants a jackbooted foot in the foreground
the engine rumbles
i feel the thunder gathering even now if i leave hopefully it will leave with me
we are craning up over the bikers back to reveal what he is looking at we are on a bluff overlooking the trailer park
in the window of one trailer below a yellow light glows
i cannot tarry
still creeping in
better i should go send you money and let you curse my name
roaring at the cut
through it we can see the biker sitting on the ground legs stretched out in front of him back resting against his parked motorcycle arms folded across his chest
perfectly motionless he stares at the campfire
we are floating in toward him
as we come closer eventually drawing in to a close shot of his face we gradually realize something peculiar about his eyes he seems to have none
although his eyes are unblinkingly open we do not see eyeballs but only fire either a reflection of the campfire or something roaring burning inside
it reads come on in
to unpainted arizona
the smoking butt of a cheroot is dropped onto the mat
a jackbooted foot grinds it out
leading into the showroom
the bikers mail and chained fist pushes the door open
behind the jackboots as they stroll through a showroom of unpainted furniture and bathroom fixtures
swinging as he walks the bikers hand produces a fresh cheroot from no apparent source either sleight of hand or magic
similarly producing a long wooden match
biting down on the cigar
dragging the kitchen match along the unfinished wood surface of an expensive bureau leaving an ugly black scar
the match erupts into roaring flame
crackling as it is lit
reading executive offices
the mailed fist pushes it open
from the inside of the office
the name on the pebbled glass is a backwards nathan arizona
there is the shadow of a man approaching the door and muffled voices
im sorry mr
arizona he just barged in
the door swings open and nathan stands looking in his middle aged secretary hanging at his elbow
should i call dewayne
nathan is staring toward his desk
hell no why wake the security guard
ill take care a this
the secretary leaves
the biker sits with his back to us jackboots propped lazily on the desk
his head bobs and ducks as if he is following some movement in the air in front of him
eyes on the biker he slams the door shut behind him looking for some reaction
his head continues to bob and duck
circling the biker as he crosses to sit behind his desk
arcing around to reveal the bikers face
he still does not react to nathan not even bothering to give him a glance
his eyes continue to follow some phantom movement
when the biker speaks it is still without looking at nathan and with a surprisingly soft voice and mild unhurried manner you got flies
he finally looks at nathan and smiles faintly
i doubt it
this places climate controlled all the windows are sealed
who the hell are you
name of leonard smalls
my friends call me lenny
he takes a drag on his cigar
only i aint got no friends
stop youll make me bust out crying
listen leonard you want some furniture or a shitbox theyre out on the sales floor
smalls is pleasantly shaking his head
nooo i aint a customer im a manhunter
though i do hunt babies on occasion
hear you got one you cant put your hand to
what do you know about it
wal thats my business
im a tracker part hopi indian some say part hound dog
when some dink skips bail crashes outta the joint im the man they call
mister i got the cops the state troopers and the federal b i already lookin for my boy

short of that what do we got to talk about
and that aint whatever you say it is fair price is what the marketll bear
now there are people mind you there are people in this land wholl pay a lot moren twenty grand for a healthy baby
nathan is looking at him stonily
whatre you after
give you an idea when i was a lad i mself fetched twenty five thousand on the black market
and thems dollars
im sayin fair price
for fifty grand ill track him find him quick as a flash the heretofore languid smalls bolts forward his fist stopped an inch short of nathans nose
his index finger and thumb are pinched together holding the leg of a struggling fly that he has just plucked from the air
and the people that took him
he flicks the fly away
ill kick their butts
he sits back down
no extra charge
nathan stares grimly at smalls
and if i dont pay
oh ill get your boy regardless
cause if you dont pay the market will
you wanna know what i think
i think youre an evil man
i think this is nothin but a goddamn screw job
i think its a shakedown
i think youre the one took nathan jr
and my fine friend i think youre the one gonna get his butt kicked
nathan swivels to punch numbers on a telephone
i think im on the phone to the cops right now and i he swivels back looking up and his speech stops short
the office is empty
a whipcrack effect builds to the cut and his eyes snap open as the whipcrack echoes away
he has been slumped over the kitchen table asleep
up and attem h
today is the first day of the rest of your life
and already youre fuckin it up
hi looks up
gale and evelle are smiling down at him
come on the missusll be back from town soon
hi takes the envelope that he was slumped over to ed written on its face
as he sticks it to the refrigerator door with a broccoli magnet wheres the baby
bedroom in his crib
hes sawin toothpicks hell be fine
there is a harsh knock at the door
all three tense
you expectin anybody
hi is staring
the knock comes again
you two stay outta sight
he goes to the door pulls back its shade and peeks out
under his breath shit
he opens the door
it is glen
he backs nervously down to the foot of the stoop as hi stands in the half open doorway
glen comes to rest a few feet away from the stoop
he is wearing a neckbrace
the bridge of his eyeglasses is taped together
cotton wadding is stuffed up his nose which is darkly discolored
he holds a rolled up newspaper
his station wagon is parked behind him idling
glen speaks in a very nasal voice i aint comin in if ya dont mind
ill just keep my distance
i didnt invite you in glen
well dont even bother
first off youre fired and thats official
i kinda figured that glen
well that aint why im here neither
youre in a whole shitload of trouble my friend
hi is looking at him evenly
why dont you just calm down glen
why dont you make me
know that little baby you got in there
i know what his real name is
hi is suddenly nervous and urgent wanna keep your voice down glen
ill pitch my voice wherever i please
his name aint hi jr
his name aint ed jr
but its junior an right
yes sir its nathan jr
hi takes one step down holding out a calming hand
glen takes two nervous steps away and reassures himself by resting a hand on the door of his station wagon
stay away from me mcdunnough
hi stops short
sure youre an awful big man when you got somethin around to clobber a guy with
softly i aint a big man
and now youre at my mercy
he spits on the dirt in front of him
im your worst nightmare
i wanted to just turn you in for the re ward
but dot she wants something to cuddle
so it looks like that babys gonna be glen jr
from now on
his face is set in rigid dismay
ill give you a day to break the news to ed
glen is getting into his car
dotll be by tomorrow to pick him up
he slams the door
its either that or jail
oh and say that reminds me
youll find a doctor bill in the mail in a few days
i recommend you pay it
and the car squeals off
hi looks back at the trailer
a slat in the window blind drops back into place
he opens the door
evelle is already emerging from the bedroom with the baby in his arms
hi moves toward evelle
his teeth are set he means business
whats goin on here
gale steps in front of hi
you know whats goin on h
its just business
now this can go either hard or easy hi gives gale a hard push to get past him
gale staggers back but recovers and grabs hi in a bear hug
hi flips gale
gale lands on a coffee table which flips up and crashes back down
evelle is dancing back out of his reach
as hi lunges for him the prostrate gale grabs his legs
hi goes down hard
gale leaps to his feet and crash bangs his head up against an overhanging lamp
both of his hands fly up to massage the top of his head
thoomp his fist flies into frame to connect with gales unguarded stomach
gale doubles over clutching at his gut
hi interlaces his fingers to make a club of his two hands
with gales bowed head a target in front of him hi swings his hands up over his head
his knuckles scrape painfully against the plaster of the too low ceiling
skin is flayed plaster crumbles
hi grabs at his knuckles in pain
gale lunges with a mid body tackle that sends hi crashing into the wall
gale still on top of him reaches back to throw a punch
the reach back sends his elbow crashing through a window but doesnt stop the punch
it connects with his jaw
gale throws another quick punch all his weight behind it
his head bobs sideways just in time and gales fist goes through the wall
it is momentarily stuck there
hi uses the opportunity to grab gales one free arm with both of his
he is twisting it to make gale roaring with pain twist around and present his back to him
hi climbs aboard grabbing gales face
gale still roaring is pulling his fist out of the hole
he grabs a lath exposed by the hole and pulls it tears out of the wall and snaps free giving him a length of about two feet
gale is rampaging around like a grizzly bear hemmed in a too small space
hi is hanging on for dear life his own feet flailing this way and that knocking over lamps and wall fixtures as gale bends and twirls about trying to shake
gale crashes and bounces off the walls roaring in pain and fury
close shots of gales face show his features impossibly and grotesquely contorted by his hand squeezing gripping and clutching at it
evelle is dancing around with the baby dodging crashing furniture and flailing body parts
at the cut gales roaring drops out
we hear the chirping of birds and the laughter of children playing in the neighborhood
it is a sunny day
gale still roars
with a last mighty effort he finally swings hi off his body
hi crashes against a wall and through it to land in the amid a shower of plaster dust and lath
hi has landed groggily against the toilet
evelle enters now with his hands free apparently having set the baby down somewhere
he yanks the cord off the bathroom blinds
hi is seated in a straight back chair still violently struggling but gales arms are wrapped around him from behind
evelle is just finishing tying off his wrists behind the chair
no one talks there is nothing left to say
finished gale goes to the door and evelle goes to the bedroom
he emerges with the baby and precedes gale out the door gale slamming it behind him
hi starts bucking and struggling weeping tears of rage and frustration
he succeeds only in tipping forward face down into the carpet the strapped on chair pressing down on top of him
his profile is pressed into the carpet
offscreen we hear the door of the trailer opening
at carpet level
gales shoes enter his field of vision
they stride over to a mess of debris in the corner of the living room
as gale paws through the wreckage to expose the copy of dr
spocks baby and child care
he grabs the book
the feet walk away and leave his field of vision
as we hear the door slam shut with horrible finality
his mouth stretches wide
he roars with grief and frustration
moving down the road toward an oncoming car
as the oncoming car gets closer we can see gale and evelle in its front seat
as the car passes we pan with it to reveal that we have been shooting from the inside of another car and we hold on the profile of its driver
she has just watched the other car shoot past
as ed sits heavily into frame apparently in shock her frozen profile to the camera as she stares straight ahead into space
her foreground hand absently holds a length of cord
beyond her in the middle background hi is rummaging in the debris
he stands up cropped from the chest down and starts loading bullets into the chamber of eds
frantically i know youre worried honey but believe me there aint a thing to worry about
were gonna get him back there just aint no question about that
he snaps the chamber shut and leaves frame still talking
well get him back thats just all there is to it
and you wanna know another thing
he is walking back into frame holding another handgun now in addition to the
this one an automatic
im gonna be a better person from here on out
and thats final i mean thats absolutely the way its gonna be thats official
you were right and i was wrong
he snaps a clip into the automatic
a blind man could tell you that
now they aint gonna hurt him theyre just in it for the score
hi is leaving frame again continuing to talk as we hear him rummaging offscreen
but i aint like that no more im a changed man
you were right and i was wrong
we got a family here and im gonna start acting responsibly
hi enters frame with the two handguns stuck in his belt holding his pump action shotgun
so lets go honey
he primes the shotgun whoosh clack
lets go get nathan jr
from the front bumper of an automobile
beautiful desert stretches to the horizon
the road rushes under the camera
gale drives gazing out at the road
evelle holds nathan jr
occasionally bouncing him
contemplatively i luuuuv to drive
you said somethin there partner
yessir i figure with the ransom and this bank youn ill be sittin in the fabled catbird seat
evelle is looking down at the baby shifting him in his lap
junior had a uh accident
whats that pardner
he had a little accident
gale looks over
wuddya mean he looks okay
no ya see
movin though we are he just had hisself a rest stop
well its perfectly natural
very excited hey gale
evelle beaming looks up from the baby to gale
he smiled at me
a huge rumbling rippling red ball that fills the frame
as we hear his footfalls on concrete steps smalls rises into frame apparently climbing a stoop
the sun behind him throws him into silhouette the extreme telephoto flattens him against the sun
heat waves ripple between us and him making his figure slightly waver
the rumble builds louder and louder until it is snapped off by a click
the front door handle clicks open and smalls stands in the doorway
the abandoned trailer is perfectly quiet
the room is a complete shambles from the fight
sunlight filters in between the slats of the venetian blinds
smoke from lenny smalls cheroot ripples up through the light
after only a momentary pause at the door to take in the scene smalls goes directly to a specific spot in the debris and nudges some of it aside with
his toe exposing a piece of paper
he bends down to pick it up but suddenly freezes with a soft grunt of surprise
at knee height on the wall in front of him fart is scrawled in crayon
as he stands up with the piece of paper
it is gales picture of the farmers and mechanics bank
close on a carton of diapers being set down on the check out counter
know how you put these thangs on
evelle and the cashier a late middle aged man perhaps the proprietor of this small mom and pop store face each other across the check out counter
evelle has various baby purchases the diapers baby food etc
piled on the counter
the cashier is ringing them up
through the open door beyond them we can see a strip of the parking lot
around the butt then up over the groin area i know where they go old timer
i mean do i need pins or fasteners
we see gale trotting past through the visible part of the parking lot cooing weeeeee
as he holds nathan jr
up over his head
well no they got those tape ettes already on there its self contained and fairly explanatory
he takes a plastic covered squirt gun off a display rack and drops it on the counter
he is looking around at the other impulse purchases displayed by the register he unhooks a bag of balloons
these blow up into funny shapes at all
gale is trotting by in the opposite direction weeeeee
unless round is funny
evelle is pulling a gun out of his belt
all right ill take these too
now you lie down back there yessir
and dont you move till youve counted up to eight hundred and twenty five and then backwards down to zero
ill be back to check see yaint cheatin
the cashier is already down on the floor out of frame
you the diaper burglar
as he heads for the door with the groceries looks like im one of em
as evelle hurriedly emerges with the two bags
faintly we can hear the cashier bellowing one one thousand two one thousand
get the door will ya
gale is slipping the baby back into his car seat which sits on the roof of the car
he starts doing up the straps
hes a real cheerful little critter once he warms up to ya
hands free now gale reaches for the back door
hurry up gale
gale has the door open
evelle starts throwing in the groceries
i dont know how high this one can count
gale drives as evelle sorts through his purchases
i got him some baby grub
packet of balloons they blow up into funny shapes at all
no just gale is looking around puzzled
say wheres junior
wuddya mean didnt you put him in
no i thought the two men look at each other
the two mens heads whip around to look in the back seat
they look at each other in horror
whered we leave him
the two mens eyes widen as they remember at the same time both look up at the roof of the car
coming off the accelerator
screaming as he watches the foot but too late
already plunging down on the brake
evelle is screaming at the top of his lungs as the car rocks to a stop
he peers through the windshield still screaming but nothing has shot off the roof of the car
he cranes his neck to look up the slant of the windshield toward the roof
this of course gives him no view still screaming he thrusts his body out his open window to look up at the roof
his scream is muted as his head disappears from view then comes back full force as he ducks back in frantically shaking his head
with this gales last hope disappears and he starts bellowing also
rising from the brake to plunge down on the accelerator
as it hangs a squealing u turn and races off at top speed
in the foreground nathan jr
sits upright in his car seat in the middle of the road that fronts the convenience store
he is placidly looking at the scenery
faintly we hear the cashier bellowing seven hunnert ninety seven one thousand seven hunnert ninety six one thousand
in their speeding car both staring out at the road ahead mouths gaping emitting ear splitting screams
shot faces the front of the store with some of the street visible outside
the cashier on the floor is out of frame but we can hear him loud and clear seven hunnert ninety one one thousand seven hunnert ah
he rises into frame back to the camera just as we see gale and evelles car through the front window roaring up the street
quick as a shot the cashier has dropped back out of frame and resumes bellowing seven hunnert ninety ought one thousand
seven hundred eighty the car is starting to squeal to a screaming halt
with nathan jr
in the foreground
gale and evelles car comes to a rocking halt behind and inches shy of the baby
evelles door is already open
he bolts from it and runs over to the baby blubbering
he picks up the car seat and nathan jr
gale is also getting out of the car
promise we aint never gonna give him up gale
we aint never gonna let him go
gale choked up speaks in a low unsteady voice well never give him up evelle
hes our little gale jr
both are staring wordlessly ahead at the road
hi looks over at ed glum but trying to be kind
ed i realize i cant be much of a comfort to you
but lemme just say this
he is nodding to himself
youll feel a whole lot better when i dont wanna feel better
honey i dont care about myself anymore
i dont care about us anymore
i just want nathan junior back safe
i know that if we dont get him back safe i dont wanna go on livin
and even if we do i dont wanna go on livin with you
this shuts hi up
after a moment i guess i still love you hi i know i do
i aint even blaming you
the whole thing was crazy and the whole thing was my idea
hi clears his throat
well factually i myself bear a very large lemme finish

we dont deserve nathan jr
any moren those jailbirds do
and if im as selfish and irresponsible as you yaint that bad honey
if im as bad as you what goodre we to each other
youn mes just a fools paradise
baking in the noonday sun
sitting in the front seat of their idling car looking at the bank
there she is
they look at each other
gale reaches for his door
lets do her
what do we do with gale jr
wuddya mean he waits here
are you crazy
he cant wait here by hisself
supposin we get killed in there it could be hours before hes discovered
as gale and evelle bang in through the door
evelle holds a shotgun gale holds a shotgun in one hand and nathan jr
in his car seat in the other
all right you hayseeds its a stick up
everbody down on the ground
everyone freezes staring at gale and evelle
an old hayseed with his hands in the air speaks up well which is it young fella
you want i should freeze or get down on the ground
mean to say iffen i freeze i cant rightly drop
and iffen i drop im a gonna be in motion
ya see promptly yessir
everone down on the ground
yall can just forget that part about freezin
that is until they get down there
yall hear that
there is a murmur of acknowledgment from all the people on the ground
gale is tossing evelle a sack
wanna fill that sack pardner
we got shit
he is looking in shock at the tellers counter
whered all the tellers go
there is no one behind the counter
a muffled voice from offscreen were down here sir
theyre down on the ground like you commanded gale
i told you not to use mdamn name
cant you even try to keep from forgetn that
evelle is momentarily abashed but then brightens not even yer code name
gale registers understanding
yall hear that
there is a murmur of acknowledgment from all the people on the ground
all right now everone were just about ready to begin the robbery proper
the camera is locked down on the roof of the rocketing squad car looking past its flashing gumballs
the car is approaching the townlet its siren wailing
a teller is finishing stuffing the last of two burlap bags
close on her hands we see her putting in a cash packet that is really only a few bills and a sleeve surrounding and hiding a small plastic device
the teller hits a button on the device and it starts ticking she shoves it into the sack
all right now everyone you know how this works yall stay flattened for ten full minutes
he is grabbing the two sacks and tosses one to gale who also picks up the baby
as the two are backing toward the door we might come back in five to check
thats for us to know and ya to find out
anyone found bipedal in five wears his ass for a hat
they bolt out the door
siren jumps in loud at the cut
it is the same locked down shot over the gumballs
peeling out from in front of the bank
gale is driving evelle starts pawing through one of the sacks
that old timer threw off my concentration
otherwise it would a gone smoother
we done okay
this ought to split nicely three ways
a thought registers with gale and evelle at the same moment
they look at each other
they both twist frantically to look in the back seat
ya never leave a man behind
with a loud flat crack something detonates in the front seat and the interior of the car is spattered with bright blue paint
gale and evelle both covered in blue are screaming in rage fear and incomprehension
blue dollar bills snap and flutter around the inside of the car
the car is swerving wildly as gale drives blind the inside of the windshield covered with blue paint
he reaches forward to wipe clear a patch of windshield
as the blue paint is smeared away we see hi and eds car parked broadside in the middle of the road
hi and ed are in front of it hi aiming his scatter gun ed a revolver
the guns spit orange flame
down the barrel of his shotgun
the car with the blue interior is swerving crazily at us one front tire blown out
hi lets go with the other barrel
the shot chews up the front grill shatters one headlight and blows out the other front tire
the hood of the car flies open
the car is squealing to a halt and gale and evelle pile out still bellowing
aint we got enough to contend with
ed is running over to gale and evelles car throwing open the back door to look for the baby but coming out only with dr
spocks baby and child care
evelle is staggering around in shock looking in disbelief at his own blue body
wheres the baby
evelle points this way and that in a state of confusion
i think we left him on the roof of the
he must be back at the
hi and ed are climbing into their car
let us come with you
hi and ed are already peeling out
hes our baby too
sitting placidly in his car seat that sits in the middle of the road in front of the bank
we can hear the wail of the police siren still approaching
as we hold on nathan jr
we hear the distant booming of a shotgun
as we boom up to show the empty street beyond the baby we hear the crack of return fire and furiously squealing brakes
the screech culminates in a loud explosion that snaps off the siren wail
the police car is apparently history
from beyond the crest of the road ahead a ball of flame has leapt up with the explosion
as the explosion echoes and fades we hear the deep rumble of an approaching engine
lenny smalls motorcycle appears over the rise
framed against fire and smoke he is coming directly toward us and the baby
as they top a rise coming from the other direction
we see the baby sitting in the middle of the street and lenny fast approaching from the background
the extremely low wide shot locked down to the speeding bike shows us rushing toward the rear of nathan jrs car seat
with a clank of chains lennys hand drops down into frame palm forward tensing to scoop up the car seat that we are almost upon
a tattoo on lennys wrist reads no prisoners
low shot with nathan jr
in the foreground
he is scooped up and out of frame as lenny roars by
he hooks the car seat over his handlebars
lenny is approaching
under her breath what is he
dyou see him too
lenny is sawing a shotgun out of his back holster and leveling it at the oncoming car
lenny is sighting down the gun swinging it around as he approaches the car
the shotgun spits orange flame and the windshield explodes in
lenny roars by
the baby on the handlebars in the foreground the road rushing by beyond him
the bike banks into a hard turn
shooting through where the windshield used to be cutting in at the end of the skid as the car rocks to a halt
hi and ed are raising their heads
facing forward they do not see lenny approaching again through the rear window
he is sawing out his second shotgun
hi looks around reaches and pulls ed down beneath him just as ka boom
the second shotgun roars and the back window spits in
as lenny roars past the back window he casually flips something in
folded over in the front seat
below them something bounces into and around the leg well lennys grenade
as the two front doors fly open and hi and ed spill out hi from the drivers side heading for the far side of the road and ed from the
as she dives for cover behind a parked car
beyond her kaboom
their car explodes and bounces pouring black smoke
the explosion flings him to the ground in the middle of the street
looking up the street to where lenny is wheeling his bike in a u turn
he is not finished yet
hi flat on his back woozily shaking his head
he weakly raises himself on his elbows to look down the street
looking down the length of his own body
his legs stretch away in a v
crashing down from a wheelie lennys roaring bike is almost upon him aiming up the middle of the v
as the bike is roaring by reaches and snags a chain on lennys passing boot
dragged several yards before the boot shakes him off leaving him on his stomach in the middle of the road
hi looks up the road
lenny is again sluing the bike around
smoking as it skids around in the foreground completing its turn
boom up lennys back to reveal ed stomping straight up the street toward him unarmed unafraid
i want that baby
he reaches back to pull up his shirt revealing a gun tucked in his pants in the small of his back
he grabs the gun
as ed closes in
gimme that baby you warthog from hell
lennys arms rise into frame
with a roll of his wrists two knives appear in his hands
on his stomach sighting down the gun toward lenny
ed stepping into his line of fire blocking lenny
raising an arm to stab
ed stoops to scoop the baby from the car seat revealing hi behind her
drilled by his bullet drops its knife
the exit wound spurts not flesh and blood but a brief jet of fire
quick as a flash hurling the other knife at hi
as the knife stings the gun out of his hand
lenny bends to scoop up the knife he dropped
as she runs toward the bank clutching nathan jr
to her chest
as ed bursts in
the floor is littered with obedient hayseeds
from where he lies prone just lie down on the floor missie
bang the front door bursts open before lennys roaring hog
it sails off a step into the sunken atrium and lands with a crash amidst the hayseeds
as she runs for the back door and pushes through it
as he slaloms through the wildly scattering hayseeds
as lenny bursts out
with a whipcrack effect he looks left then right
he jerks the bike right to where an alleyway flanks the side of the bank
ed is running up the alley toward the front of the bank as lenny enters
he roars after her
roaring down the alley
as the bike approaches behind her
closing on ed as she reaches the mouth of the alley
a plank swings into frame straight at the camera
matching action as hi finishes swinging the plank into lennys face
lenny hits the ground hard as his bike spins out from under him
riderless twisting crazily into the street where it collapses
lenny is rising to his feet beyond them as hi nods encouragement to ed
run along now honey
lenny is reaching back to throw his knife
hi unaware is turning to face him presenting the plank as the knife is thrown
it thunks into the plank piercing it through
hi backs up swinging the knife studded plank to make lenny keep his distance
as he reaches up to unhook a chain from a ring on his vest shoulder
as the free chain drops down into his palm
swinging the chain whoosh whoosh at the backpedaling hi
as the chain snakes around it and rips it out of his hands
grabbing hi by the shirtfront
swings down and brass knuckles appear on it
as lennys fist swings into frame to club him forehand then backhand
an uppercut from his heels sends hi sprawling back
as hi lands against it banging his head
he sinks to the ground
lenny is casually walking toward him lighting a cheroot
hi flops over onto his stomach and starts wriggling under the car
his face in the foreground as he desperately seeks escape
behind him we can see lenny casually reaching down and grabbing an ankle
the shot is framed identically to the shot in the arizona nursery where hi pulled a baby from under the crib
hi is dragged away from the camera and out from under the car
struggling to stand up
lenny wraps his arms around him and applies a tremendous bear hug
crushed against lenny
his hands paw futilely at lennys chest
lenny finally flings hi away
landing in the dust all the fight beaten out of him
tired of the fight he saws out both shotguns on the guns as lennys thumbs draw them back
he raises the guns to fire
the end of the road
he wearily lifts a hand defensively extending it in front of him then stops staring at a hand grenade pin hangs glinting from one of his fingers
pawing at lennys chest he must have hooked his finger through its ring
reacting to hi reacting
he looks down
on the bandoliers across his chest silver pins glint in all the grenades except one
its squeeze lever juts at a right angle from the grenade
his jaw drops
the lit cheroot hits the ground between his boots
scrambling to his feet
trying to drop the shotguns to free his hands
in his panic his fingers tangle in the trigger guards
starting to run
finally freeing his hands
diving behind the parked car
his hands fly in to wrap around the grenade too late bright light blows sky high
there is a roar as if the earth were cracking open and flame as if hell were slipping out
we pan the fire to the sky
a white aluminum ladder rises up into the blackness clanking softly
the top of the ladder arcs toward the camera
to the interior of the arizona second story nursery as the ladder comes to rest against the window frame
it is late at night the nursery is dark and empty
of the unpainted crib with the burned in names harry barry larry garry and nathan jr
as we pull back from the headboard eds arms are gently depositing the sleeping nathan jr
into the crib
hi puts the singed copy of dr
spocks baby and child care next to the baby
hi and ed looking sadly down at the baby
the silence is broken by the bleat of a squeeze me toy as the lights are snapped on
hi and ed turn startled
nathan stands in his jammies hair disheveled holding a gun and squinting against the light
keeping the gun trained on hi and ed he slowly raises a pair of eyeglasses to his nose
the hell is goin on
he advances cautiously into the nursery gesturing with his gun
get away from there
hi and ed back away from the crib
nathan peers in and studies the baby for a moment
he lays the gun down tenderly picks up the baby and holds him to his chest
a tear forms at the corner of his eye
hi and ed are quietly moving back towards the ladder
hi and ed stop
i aint through with you
whatre you doin creepin around here in the dark
you in with smalls
as he bounces the baby studying hi and ed leonard smalls big fella rides a harley dresses like a rock star
no sir thats who we saved him from
its a long story
suppose you tell it
well sir in a re ward situation they usually say no questions asked
nathan turns to put the baby back in the crib
all right boy i guess you got a re ward coming
twenty thousand dollars
he turns around with a thought or if you need home furnishings i can give you a fine of credit at any of my stores
fact thats the way id rather handle it for tax reasons
well nathan throws his hands up in the air
but its up to you
tell you the truth i think wed prefer the ca we dont want no reward
hi does a small take surprised at this much integrity
we didnt bring him back for money
well we could work it that way too
could i just look at him a little bit more
she stands looking into the crib
hi steps up next to her and puts an arm around her shoulder
be my guest young lady
but would you mind tellin me exactly how you ed starts crying softly as she gazes into the crib
hi murmurs something to comfort her
nathan is studying the two of them
you took him didnt you
wasnt that biker atal
hi turns to face him
he speaks in a rush
i took him sir my wife had nothin to do with it
i crept in yon window and still crying we both did it
we didnt wanna hurt him any i just wanted to be a mama
it wasnt for money or nothin
we just figured you had moren you could handle babywise
but im the one committed the actual crime sir if you need to call the authorities shutup boy no ones callin the authorities if theres no harm done
thank you sir
thank you sir
just tell me just tell me why you did it
we cant have our own
nathan looks at her
finally he nods and sighs
if you cant have kids you gotta just keep tryin and hope medical science catches up with you
like florencen me it caught up with a vengeance
and hell even if it never does you still got each other
sir thosere kind words
but i think the wife and me are splittin up
he indicates ed with a nod of the head
her point of view is were both kinda selfish and unrealistic so we aint too good for each other
well maam i dont know much but i do know human beins
you brought back my boy so you must have your good points too
id sure hate to think of florence leavin me i do love her so
he clears his throat and turns to the door
his tone is harder again you can go out the way you came in
he snaps off the lights
and before you go off and do another foolish thing like busting up i suggest you sleep on it
he has disappeared into the hall
we hear his voice receding at least one night
looking straight down at hi asleep in the trailer bedroom
we start to crane down
that night i had a dream
a beautiful dusk landscape
we are floating in over the field abutting the prison that gale and evelle popped out of
in the middle background of the extreme long shot two men are walking across the field
i dreamt i was as light as the ether a floating spirit visiting things to come
craning down toward hi
the shades and shadows of the people in my life wrastled their way into my slumber
still floating forward but now much closer to the two walking men
we see that they are gale and evelle
both are still dyed blue
they are approaching the hole in the ground
i dreamt that gale and evelle had decided to return to prison
evelle is starting to climb into the hole
probably thats just as well
i dont mean to sound superior and theyre a swell couple guys but
evelle has disappeared and gale starts climbing in
maybe they werent ready yet to come out into the world
the front door has a holly wreath on it
and then i dreamed on into the future to a christmas morn in the arizona home
five three year olds in their pajamas are opening presents around a tree as nathan and florence look on
where nathan jr
was opening a present from a kindly couple who preferred to remain unknown
we have been isolating in on one of the children peeling the wrappings off a package marked to nathan jr
inside is a shiny red plastic football
pulled over on the state highway in the middle of the desert a police motorcycle parked behind it
glen is leaning out the drivers window of the car talking to the state trooper who stands facing him
i saw glen a few years later still havin no luck gettin the cops to listen to his wild tales about men ed
glen is grinning and talking with his hands cupped in front of him as when he told hi about the pollack who almost stepped in the pile of shit
the trooper in crash helmet and dark sunglasses is listening tight lipped and stone faced as glen finishes his story and slaps his knee
maybe he threw in one pollack joke too many
the trooper is clicking open his ballpoint pen and reaching his citation book from his breast pocket
the name tag on the pocket says sgt
i dont know
it sits on a tee in the middle of a football field
and still i dreamed on
a cleated foot boots the football out of frame
further into the future than id ever dreamed before
looking up arms out at his sides waiting to receive the kicked ball
watching nathan jr
s progress from afar
he catches the ball and starts running
taking pride in his accomplishments as if he were our own
he is skillfully eluding and stiff arming tacklers
wondering if he ever thought of us
he reaches the end zone and triumphantly spikes the football
he whips off his helmet and we track in on the face of the rosy cheeked high school bruiser
and hoping that maybe wed broadened his horizons a little even if he couldnt remember just how theyd got broadened
still craning down now very close to the sleeping hi
but still i hadnt dreamt nothin about men ed
until the end
the man and woman are sitting on a sofa in the foreground with their backs to the camera
they are in the living room of hi and eds trailer which is suffused with a warm golden light
as they face the trailers front door all we see of the couple is the backs of their heads
they both have white hair the womans pulled into a bun
the old man wears a cardigan the woman a shawl
and this was cloudier cause it was years years away
the front door bursts open
two young couples are entering as their kids about a dozen of them stream in around them
the old couple on the couch raise their arms to embrace their visitors
the children boil onto the couch
but i saw an old couple bein visited by their children and all their grandchildren too
and the old couple wasnt screwed up and neither were their kids or their grandkids
and i dont know you tell me
this whole dream was it wishful thinking
was i just fleein reality like i know im liable to do
in the trailer
the table is all laid out with a thanksgiving dinner a huge turkey sitting at the far end
cut out letters at the other end of the room say welcome the grandchildren are running into frame and taking their seats at the table accompanied by their parents
but men ed we can be good too
the elderly couple enter from either side of the camera and stand in the foreground backs to us facing the table
and it seemed real
it seemed like us
and it seemed like well
if not arizona then a land not too far away where all parents are strong and wise and capable and all children are happy and beloved
i dunno maybe it was utah
the elderly man drapes an arm around his wifes shoulder and draws her close
