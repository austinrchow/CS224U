written by michael diliberti matthew sullivan the following is very loosely based on some shit that actually happened
we hear the roar of a v engine piped out through some throaty fucked up muffler as an mustang bursts like a shot over a rise in the highway
its got a rusted two tone paint job maryland plates and bald tires that scream as it peels off an exit and into the the car fast approaches a stop
sign dangerously blows through the intersection
we dont see the driver only the redlining rpms vans slip ons working the pedals wristwatch being checked
the wheel cranks right as the car turns onto a one way street
a minivan flies right at us
the mustang hops up onto the curb to avoid it clips a trash can and garbage explodes like confetti
the wipers engage brushing the trash aside
the car whips another turn and the mustang fishtails around a corner and skids away
brake pads smoke
the mustang stops outside the driver jumps out of the car
as he rushes to the front door we see the urgent package he is delivering
before he can ring the bell the door opens and two smug year olds stare out
youre minutes late
reveal our guy staring back at the kids
this is will probably good looking in another life
right now he is tired and unamused wearing a red giorgios trattoria hat and a sweaty matching t shirt
gimme a break
you guys live two towns away
its pretty much fucking impossible to get here in minutes
thats why we ordered from your shitty trattoria
this is gonna come out of my paycheck
you sure you dont want to take the moral high ground
wed rather take the pizzas
will takes a calming breath
hands over the pizzas
you guys are pretty smart
you figured out a way to beat the system
got the house to yourselves
any jailbait in there
little pizza and a rainbow party
the kids shakes their heads
well two hustlers like yourselves gotta have the place stocked with beer and whippits and shit right
just call the girls up and let them know the partys on
man we dont have any of that stuff
will makes a show of mulling this over
i really shouldnt do this
but you seem like a couple of good dudes
ill tell you what you give me the money that your mom left you for the pizzas and ill grab you some beers
but i get to keep the change as a tip
the kids look at each other
one hesitantly pulls out some cash
will snatches it and heads off
ill see you in like minutes
the kids look uncertain
as if sensing this will stops before getting into his ride
you boys like budweiser right
uh yeah totally
love that shit
the sun sets
will cruises back into his own middle class town in suburban maryland
a six pack of budweiser rests in the passenger seat
will stops at a light
checks out a pretty young thing in the jeep beside him
she catches him looking rolls her eyes
the light turns and the jeep skids away
will self consciously removes his giorgios cap
will enters and nods at christopher s the manager
his balding head is nearly translucent from absorbing a days worth of pizza grease
let me cash the fuck out
will hands over some cash to christopher
you have a pretty good shift
i mean the part where i had to drop off all those pizzas kinda sucked but the rest was cool
cause i got some kids calling in saying you ripped them off
promised to buy them beer or something
i actually did buy the beer but it would have been illegal to give it to them right
so im gonna do the responsible thing and drink it myself
thats real funny
but im trying to run a business here
what kind of business promises to deliver anywhere in minutes
i dont wanna hear another one of your bullshit excuses
if i didnt need this job i wouldnt be doing this shitty job
chris is unmoving
will storms off
as he gets to the door you know you were an okay driver half the time
and youre not a puerto rican
which means something to me
i guess i could rehire you on a provisional basis
of course this would be at the slightly reduced new company rate
are you fucking serious
i dont know
is there anyone else left in town for you to work for
will shakes his head
swallows whats left of his pride
when do i start
will sits on the darkened front stoop
he tosses an empty can into the bushes and gets to work on his fourth beer
he looks over at a parked hyundai elantra
a young man sits in the passenger seat with a pensive look on his face
he makes a sudden surprised gasp
the homely young woman who was just blowing him sits up from his lap and rearranges herself in the driver seat
she leans over for a goodbye kiss
the young man obliges with much fanfare
the young man gets out and the car pulls away
this is chet a clean cut guy dressed in the gap premium collection
he heads toward the building high off his bj humming outkasts ms
he stops when he notices will in the shadows
what the hell
have you just been sitting there
caught the whole show
really classy move at the end
you know the kiss
putting your tongue in her mouth right after you fucked it
hey a nice girl decides to pleasure me on a weeknight in her car no less
im not gonna make her feel like an untouchable
im gonna make her feel like a lady
may i offer you some alcohol sir
to wash the taste of yourself out of your mouth
will offers his beer
chet takes a slug gurgles for effect
by the way she said she had a friend
maybe we can go on our first double date since you tried to talk jackie fortunato and her cousin into having a four way with us
i misread their body language
will picks up some rented movies sitting beside him
lets go inside drink your beer and watch shit get crazy
lethal weapon lethal weapon
was gonna get the third lethal weapon but decided on a porn
so its really between the first two
i choose sleep
i gotta teach a class at eight
youre a sub
just call in sick
like the real teacher did
come on man you know i got promoted to full time last month
you bought me a laser pointer
will heaves a sigh
yeah i know
i guess im just having a hard time accepting you as the man
you know flunking kids giving out spite detentions to girls you wanna fuck laser pointing at shit
i also get healthcare and my summers off
its not perfect but its a career
will grudgingly stands up
i guess thats just the difference between you and me
he holds up the lethal weapon dvds
im like riggs
cruising the streets
no rules no attachments
every other day some asshole is trying to take my badge
youre fucking murtaugh
always worried about your pension
well guess what it gets old after the first movie
i just got head
im totally riggs
will shakes his head turns and walks off
will wakes up legs dangling over the edge of a tiny couch
his tv is still on displaying the menu screen from a porn
will looks down at his coffee table
clears some magazines to reveal a file folder
flips the cover its full of college applications drafts of admissions essays a junior college transcript
will thumbs through one of the glossy applications
the kids look young
will glances over at a picture on his wall he and chet at high school graduation looking just as young
they have their arms around a pretty girl squeezed between them
will and the girl look very high and very happy
will shuts the folder slides it back under the coffee table debris
he looks over at a clock it is already pm
will jumps in and starts the engine
as he tucks his giorgios cap onto his head he catches his reflection in the rear view mirror
you titanic asshole
come on down and get your prize
he makes his fingers into a gun puts it to his head
pulls the trigger and a watermelon explodes in a shower of red juicy bits
loud dumb laughter echoes
standing yards away is dwayne an intense meaty guy in a sleeveless baltimore ravens t shirt
on his left bicep is a tattoo of the tasmanian devil flipping the bird
fruit motherfuckin salad
crouched beside him is jay tall and awkward in a wool surplus cap
he carefully rigs homemade explosives to another watermelon then looks up at dwayne
his eyes are magnified into saucers by his thick glasses
theres a peculiar eagerness to please in them
this ones gonna blow even bigger
boy if you werent such a skinny little bitch you coulda been in the military or something
i dont need the military
i taught myself how to do this shit
i hear that
i taught myself how to eat pussy
and cut my own hair
jay jogs the watermelon a safe distance away
he returns and pulls out a detonator
dwayne snatches it
this ones all me
makes radio sounds mr
president we have enemies at the gate
give me the order
more radio sounds fuck that sir
i dont negotiate with terrorists
dwayne presses a button and the explosion is so powerful that it sprinkles our guys smiling faces with fruit juice
large and early s chic
dwayne and jay have the fridge open fixing themselves a cold cut plate
dwayne is debating the amount of meat on the plate
adds some more
wanna make sure i get enough calories
i thought you wanted to get diesel for the summer
bang that towel girl at the community pool
its obvious you dont know shit all about physical fitness
you gotta bulk up first then you slim down
im clearly in the bulk up phase
i told you to watch pumping iron like a month ago
if youd listened to me maybe youd know what the fuck im talking about
grab some rc cola
the shades are drawn
we hear a girl scream bloody murder
the guys are watching friday the th part
they both wear cheap cardboard glasses
jay jumps back as jason wields a d ax
its so real
dwayne reaches out touching the d images
he stands and starts humping the air
check it out
i aint afraid of jason
im fucking him
you like that jason
in the mask
jay cracks up
the lights flick on
who are you two fags fucking
standing by the switch is dwaynes dad jerry s
most people just call him the major
the faded usmc tattoo on his thick forearm explains why
dwayne flops back onto the couch
dad were watching a flick
we got minutes and a potential d sex scene left
youre sorta coming in at the worst possible moment
i bought that tv set so i could watch my programs not so you and your friend could louse up my couch
you gotta learn how to share the common space
the only thing common in this house is you
you remind me of your damn mother
fat dumb and in my way
the major grabs dwayne and pulls him up off the couch
he gets right in his face
dwayne turns to jay
lets get outta here
this movie sucks anyway
jay gets up and files out the door
dwayne goes to take the cold cut plate
the major grabs his arm
i paid for the damn cold cuts too
maybe if you had a job or a fucking prospect or a clue how to find any of the above id let you eat em
you know you can be a real sonofabitch dad
thats what it takes boy
in the corps men like you wore dresses to keep us entertained
thats pretty fucking disturbing
dwayne storms off
dwayne and jay head out passing a brand new pickup truck in the driveway
dwayne spits on it
fuck the major
the guys get in a shitty ford aerostar minivan and peel out
kellys ignition remix pumps
large fake breasts sparkling with cheap body glitter and pierced at the nipples shake before us
their owner juicy a petite latina phones in a lap dance as dwayne pours his heart out to her
somewhere in the background jay hangs at the bar all alone
and he thinks he knows me
he dont know shit
i got ideas he could never dream of
i got plans bigger than his fucking house
he didnt even raise me
my mother did
that was a good woman
what happened to her
dwayne shifts uncomfortably at the sore subject
she passed on
i hope youre not one of those guys that comes here looking to get mothered
i wouldnt mind nursing on them titties mamacita
whatever you say
maybe just keep quiet for a while forget about your old man and let me do my thing
i wish i could forget about that asshole for good
im just waiting around for him to drop dead
dont wanna mess with my inheritance
this piques juicys interest
what kinda inheritance
when my dad got outta the service he started buying lotto tickets
hed play his dog tag numbers
in the fucker won five million bucks
insert photo the major holding a giant cardboard check
he had some health problems a few years back and since then hes been burning through the money like an nba draft pick
probably only got a million or two left
but its mine as soon as he kicks
behind inch long fake eyelashes juicys shrewd eyes narrow mind working
she straddles dwayne tightly
you know with a million bucks you could have anything
be like a king
almost a moan king dwayne
and maybe ill make you my queen
let you polish my royal scepter
practice makes perfect
juicy pantomimes a long slow chicken head
dwayne is blissed out
she smiles at him sticky sweet
let me ask you a question
do you really hate your daddy
hate him like the steelers
then maybe i can help you get that money now
before he spends another penny
dwayne looks confused
juicy puts his hands on her breasts emboldening him
i know a guy in baltimore
he could help you out
probably do it for
sizing him up gs
juicy leans in whispers softly in dwaynes ear kill your mean old dad
on dwaynes face as this new possibility pinballs around his mind setting off a flood of different emotions
so what do you think
you ready for your crown
will has one pizza left in the back of his car
he pulls over outside an office building
rows of cubicles
speckled with late night stragglers bleary eyes too busy generating detailed lists of places theyd rather be to notice the pizza boy walking along
will stops before one such work station looks on for a beat
kate turns from the glow of her computer screen
she has short messy hair and a sarcastic smile
this is the girl from the picture in wills apartment
thats the plan
five days six nights
acceptable probability of kidnapping
i leave in the morning
kate looks back at her computer logged onto an expedia checkout page for a rio vacation
she moves the mouse pointer from the proceed key
closes the window
this morning i loaded up an african safari and a cruise to alaska
oh the places youll go
making it seem so easy
just do it
get away for a while
even if i could afford that
they fired two other paralegals last week
nows not the time to be putting in for vacation days
ive got my dose of the actual working world
can we eat
will lays a pizza down on her desk
how do you keep sneaking up here past the security guard
hes there like half the time
the other half i smile at him
im relatively certain hes a homosexual
kate opens the pizza box grabs a slice
maybe i should set him up with tom small
he came out to me today on facebook
that kid beat the hell out of me and chet in grammar school
tell me about it
he fingered me at junior prom while they were playing no scrubs
what a fucking scrub
will grabs a slice
they eat quietly for a beat
so ive got some news
i thought the tom small stuff was enough of a headline but go ahead
im getting back together with mark
wills delicious pizza suddenly tastes like shit
he does his best to swallow it down
you broke up with him
ended the relationship
finality was had
yeah but we were talking and forget it
i dont want to know
you sound like chet
woah dont compare me to your brother
well neither one of you seems to care that i dont have a life
marks not perfect
but a relationship is better than working late every friday because i have nowhere else to be
i get it
here we are
nowhere to be
kate shoves will good naturedly
you know what i mean
will shrugs quietly devastated
goes back to his pizza
most of the patrons are fixated on an orioles game blaring from a large flat screen tv
at a booth in back dwayne and jay are in deep conversation
i dont wanna stick my nose into a family matter
but killing your old man
thats pretty messed up
i mean unless you think it isnt
what we have here is a classic lesser of two evils debate
you got one evil me shaving a few years off the majors shitty life
then you got the other evil the major ruining my entire awesome life by blowing through my inheritance
maybe im biased but mine sure as shit seems like the lesser
i guess i
sorta see where youre coming from
and you have been waiting around forever for that money
you deserve it dwayne
dwayne nods seriously
you know theres a reason i sleep til noon everyday
and it aint cause im lazy
its on account of me having so many goddamn dreams
and once that moneys mine theyre all gonna come true
dwayne takes a long sip of beer contemplative
like i had this one dream last night
i was cruising through town in a lamborghini diablo
the wind was blowing through my hair ruffling my open shirt
there was a hot little piece of ass sitting next to me
and in the back seat jay
wearing a pair of oakleys
i didnt know you dreamt about me dwayne
it was only this once jay
to be honest i didnt know what to make of it
so i consulted my dream book and found out it means this youre my road dog
you got my back
thats why i want to make you my partner
you see it aint just about the inheritance money
its about what im gonna do with it
dwayne leans across the table
im about to clue you in on something
and then youll understand the true magnitude of whats at stake here
are you ready
im totally ready
then answer me this
whats this town missing
ill give you a hint
its a cash business crawling with sexy bitches
a chinese food restaurant
a tanning salon
think about it
all that green
all that brown flesh
jay nods thinking about
its also the perfect front for a prostitution ring
yeah of course
because of the booths
and because of the bitches
it can all be ours
percent for you percent for me
you just gotta help me out here
jay looks conflicted
dwayne goes dark like a spurned lover
im starting to wonder if my dream book was wrong about you
maybe you sitting behind me doesnt mean youre my road dog
maybe it means youre plotting to stab me in the back like some snake in the grass
id never do something like that
the dream book was right
jay looks dwayne in the eyes knows its all or nothing
ill do it
but im not shooting him or anything
ill hold him while you shoot him
heres a fact they dont build prisons for criminals they build them for idiots
shit they got three different types of csi on tv just laying out how the police do their business
and still idiots like you think you can just go out and do a murder yourself
if you wanna be a millionaire you gotta think like one
and millionaires dont kill people
they hire assassins
which i did
we gotta pay him on tuesday
why would you do that
i was presented with an opportunity
i took it
thousand bucks for a highly trained assassin is a steal
but we dont have that kinda money
now were addressing the real problem how do we get the grand
cause once we get that we get the million
and once we get the million we will literally own this town and every single thing in it
i guess we could just
rob a bank
one of these local banks with nothing but a dipshit security guard
again not quite thinking like a millionaire
okay then lets hire someone to rob a bank
dwayne thinks about this for a second
fuck hiring them we could just force someone to rob a bank for us
like with blackmail or death threats or a bomb
everyones scared of a bomb
i was gonna say hypnotism
but i like that
its out of the fucking box
we just strap one to some motherfuckers chest like we did to those watermelons
think you can you build some kinda bomb vest
yeah i mean
camel jockeys do it in caves
i got a garage workshop
im pretty sure this is exactly how a millionaire would do it
and the beauty of it is we dont lose any sleep cause no one gets hurt
except the major
the major dies
but no one gets hurt
but a nagging thought interrupts him
theres just one problem
where do we get our guy
cause if we do a kidnapping then were right back where we started
doing shit thats gonna get us caught
what we need is someone to come to us
to a place where we can control the situation
someone without any connection to us
the guys stare at each other stumped
until something catches dwaynes attention
a local commercial playing on the flat screen
a pizza chef slides a pizza into a box well deliver anywhere in minutes or less
or your pizza is free
giorgios trattoria where the customer gets what they want
the guys look at each other
sometimes fate just takes out its cock and slaps you in the face with it
a hand grabs a beer from the fridge
youre not trying to draw a psycho pension
you really are crazy
will heads into the living room with the beer
the voice belongs to danny glover
the guys are watching lethal weapon
murtaugh danny glover has just stopped riggs mel gibson from killing himself
riggs looks at him crazily before im hungry
im gonna get something to eat
chet looks over at will
he is drunk and in a dark mood
maybe you should pace yourself
its noon on a saturday
fridge is full man
were all good
will drains half his beer
let me ask you a question
you remember tom small
yeah he used to kick our asses
turns out he was probably jerking off to it afterwards
i hope he chokes on a dick
i never liked him
your sister did
she let him finger blast her
chet pauses the movie
what the fuck are you talking about
i dont want that shit in my head
kate told me about it last night
i thought you should know
you two were swapping stories about getting fingered
thats pretty cute
will ignores him sips his beer
the point im trying to make is this tom small was an asshole
he was totally wrong for your sister
just like every other guy shes ever dated
right through to that mark dude shes gonna get back together with
un be fuck me lievable
why the fuck are we talking about who my sister goes out with
at a loss will shrugs
chet turns back to the tv presses play
lethal weapon resumes
something blows up
chet pauses the movie and stares at will for a beat
you sneaky son of a bitch
you want to fuck my sister dont you
chet i really dont
my twin sister
which is basically like fucking me
hey if you guys had that twin esp shit this would be a completely different situation
thered be logistical problems
we look exactly alike
you look like a lot of people
youre a normal looking dude
this is so fucked up i cant even begin to process it
how long has this been going on
if i had to put my finger on it
middle school ish
so all those sleepovers they were just some kind of opportunity for you to peek in kates bedroom
it might have happened a few times
most of them were accidental
youre a peeping tom
you realize that dont you
youre a sexual fucking deviant
im as normal as they come
your sister is attractive
she excites me in a sexual way
fucking sue me
cant we just be adults about it
sort of stretching the term
hey lets not say shit we cant take back
will you got kicked out of junior college for punching a professor that made fun of some poem you wrote
that poem was about your sister
that is literally the saddest thing i have ever heard
like retards playing freeze tag sad
no wonder you deliver pizzas for a living
maybe i was just hanging out with you for your sister
you were always a whiny little bitch
and you stuttered
all the kids used to call you chutter
i only started hanging out with you because you had a nintendo
did you see my nintendo naked
because i saw your sister changing into her swimsuit at your thirteenth birthday pool party
and it was the highlight of the whole shitty event
chet bites his lip
you wanna do this
i think we already are
well you know who i saw naked
while i was nailing her
the week after she dumped you
why do you think every time you wanna bet on whose cocks bigger im always willing to go in
cause i know mines bigger
cause she told me
you pulled a judas on jenny fucking rifkin
that is messed up
almost as messed up as how i sold your cal ripken signed ball for bucks
my grandpa left me that ball in his will
you helped me look for it for a month
now you know why we never found it
we done here
chets face is red with anger
not quite yet
theres actually a mystery i wanna solve for you
i was the one who told john tanner about how your mom fucked that lifeguard
and i always felt awful about it because even though he swore secrecy he told everyone else in town
and then your parents wound up getting divorced
i dont give a shit
my fucking life
will takes a swing at chet
he dodges it and puts will in some sort of choke hold
krav maga bitch
i bet your poetry professor didnt know this shit
get offa me
you threw the first punch
im gonna break this hold and then kick your skinny ass
will flexes and tries to break the choke hold
he wrenches his back away from chet and screams what the fuck is that
my knuckle in your spine
no holds barred you backstabbing fuck
im gonna pass out
face bright red i love her chet
i love kate
chet lets will go
he drops to the floor panting
let me tell you something
and its the truest thing youll ever hear from the person who knows you best in the world
youre not good enough for my sister
and you never will be
youre the lowest common denominator will
youre the square root of fucking zero
will gets to his feet
get out of my house
youre a shitty friend
right back at you
will storms out
will screeches away in his car
a day or so has passed
will sits on his couch an unshaven mess watching lethal weapon
murtaugh and riggs laugh and joke around
will looks like he might cry
he goes for his beer knocks it over
he stares at the growing puddle of beer
then grabs the folder with his college applications and uses them to sop it up
will sits at a table looking out through the misty window
christopher boxes a pizza and drops it in front of him
come on wake up and get to work
christopher hands him the order slip
will checks the address
where the fuck is this
how should i know
its minutes away or the pizza comes out of your paycheck
wills mustang travels down a dark empty stretch of highway
the lone working taillight fades as the car disappears into the distance
the mustang stops at the mouth of a driveway
overgrown shrubbery blocks anything beyond it from view
all that will can see is a red and white radio tower jutting into the sky beacon light flashing atop it
will checks the address then drives through the open gate
the mustang parks at the end of the driveway
will gets out
there is a large storage shed and across a clearing a radio tower built on top of a small office structure
the office door is ajar
florescent light glows from inside
calling back from beyond door hey bud
sorry for the hike
the countys got us doing repairs at the ass end of the night
this puts will at ease
he heads toward the office
as he gets close a figure appears in the doorway
it is dwayne what the will hears something behind him and whirls around to find jay also in a gorilla mask charging at him
will makes a run for it
but the guys are on top of him in no time
he madly fights them off and dashes for his car
we got a gun you asshole
will breaks toward the cover of the shrubbery
jay is right on wills tail
without breaking stride jay picks up a large branch and wings it at him
will is hit in the legs and stumbles over himself
jay leaps on top of him and locks his skinny legs around wills body
what the hell
at a loss rape
jay wrestles something from his pocket
a chloroform soaked rag
he presses it hard against wills mouth and nose
will soon goes limp
dwayne appears looming above them
he pulls his gorilla mask back and smiles
blurry vision coming into focus
whereas the masks looked scary at night they look ridiculous now
will is propped up on the hood of his car staring at his captors
his mouth is duct taped hands bound behind his back
he wears his giorgios cap and a buttoned up olive green army jacket
you thought we were gonna rape you
will mumbles something through the duct tape
just shut up
the tape is there for a reason
cause this next part is gonna take a measure of calm
are you with me
can you be calm
dwayne holds up his driver license
will dixon of north whatever the fuck street right now you are wearing an explosive vest
will looks down at the jacket he is wearing tries to get his hands loose so he can tear it open
calm the fuck down
for emphasis dwayne reveals the gun tucked down the front of his pants like a big metal cock
now stay still and my associate will show you
jay carefully unbuttons the army jacket
will is in fact wearing an explosive vest
it is a cobbled together but intimidating looking contraption crisscrossed by multicolored wires
there is a thick lock at the hinge with a digital display and a keypad
will begins to hyperventilate
take it easy man
i built this thing
its pretty stable
for a fucking bomb
so dont trip over your shoelaces or anything
that things full of c
and the c is for chaos
actually the c stands for composite
but yeah id try not to slam into stuff
can i take that tape off now pizza boy
dwayne rips the duct tape off his mouth
you know where you are
you might as well be in space motherfucker
nobody can hear you scream
why are you doing this to me
i dont have any money
but youre gonna go get us some
whatever you say
ill go sell my car
ill get you like a thousand bucks
i want thousand
where the fuck am i supposed to get that much money
the donner wells national bank on charles road
across the street from the olive garden
yeah the one across the street from the olive garden
do you guys have an account or something
dwayne shakes his head like will is an idiot
no i dont have an account
youre gonna rob it
how the fuck am i supposed to rob a bank
figure it out
you got a bomb strapped to your chest
thats a start
itll scare the fuck outta people
maybe use your brain and go get a gun
borrow one from a friend for all i care
it aint rocket science
then do it yourself
i would but im already wearing this gorilla mask and youre already wearing that bomb
tell him about the vest
jay turns to will
you seem like a pretty trustworthy guy
i mean you got a job and all
but just in case you were gonna try to take the vest off we booby trapped it to shit
theres also a remote detonator on the back so we can trigger it by dialing a number
and its on speed dial
so do what you gotta do but well be watching
you go anywhere near a police station and fourth of july comes early this year
dwayne nods at the timer on the side of the vest
you got hours
he hands will a slip of paper
once you have the money call this number and youll be given instructions on where to drop it
you do good we give you the six digit combination that stops the timer and opens the lock
tomorrow morning you can go back to delivering pizza the mail whatever the fuck you want
now let me demonstrate what happens if you dont get us the money
dwayne looks over to where an oversized stuffed bear rigged with its own bomb vest sits on a tree stump yards away
dwayne mimes answering a phone hey teddy ruxpin
you dont have the money
it was too tough to rob the bank so you just went back to your bear cave and cried like a bitch
well guess what my stuffed friend
time is up
jay pushes a button on a detonator
teddy ruxpin explodes
all that remains is a cloud of stuffing
will is frozen in fear
i liked that bear
i dont even know you
dwayne throws will his car keys
get outta here
guys can we please just talk about this
yeah of course we can
dwayne pulls out the gun and fires two shots at wills feet
jay jumps backward as does will who hits the hood of his car slides across it and onto the ground by the driver side
will awkwardly gets to his feet and arranges himself in the car adjusting to the weight of the bomb
as he starts the engine and backs away thats right
get the fuck out of here
youre wasting time
once the car is gone jay yanks off his gorilla mask
dwayne stays primate
what the hell dwayne
you told me that was a replica gun
then i paid a mexican bucks to put a firing pin in it
now it goes boom
we didnt discuss a loaded gun
especially not with the bomb around
dwayne gets right in jays face
the plastic eyes of his mask betray no emotion
dont you ever question me
im fucking this bitch
youre just holding the camera
whatever you say
cause this aint the marines
this is cash money
you hesitate you fuck up
and i will leave you behind
a tense beat
dwayne pulls his mask off
he looks oddly calm
lets go get some breakfast
wills car flies down the road
it screeches to a stop tires smoking
will jumps out stumbles to the shoulder and pukes
he drops to his knees
someone please fucking help me
nothing but the wind
will fights back tears
he gets to his feet wipes his mouth
he takes out his cell phone scrolls through the contacts
he pauses on chets name
the line goes to voicemail
will looks at the bombs timer hours minutes and counting
he hurries to his car
a laser dot dances around the middle of a united states map
chet is teaching a history lesson to a bunch of seventh graders that look very mature and very bored
as he indicates with his laser pointer this whole region here about thousand square miles was part of the initial louisiana purchase
the class giggles
chet embarrassed puts away the pointer
there is a knock at the door
chet turns to see wills face in the doors window pane
he looks back to his class
take out your workbooks
chet opens the door
what do you want
we gotta talk
im working here
do not mess with me at work
chet for the love of god just talk to me in private for one minute
chet leads a jumpy will into chet shuts the door behind them
you wanna apologize dont you
you look like shit
youve probably been up for days thinking about what an asshole you were
well its gonna take a lot more than some pathetic groveling chet
i dont wanna apologize to you
then what do you want
because we dont have anything left to say to each other
will swallows hard
and this is gonna sound crazy
because it is fucking crazy
but last night two guys in masks jumped me and strapped a bomb to my chest and now i have less than eight hours to rob a bank
chet just stares at will unimpressed
im going back to work now
will steps in chets way
he unbuttons his jacket revealing the bomb
what the fuck
is that real
chet jumps backward stumbles over a desk and scurries on his ass to the other end of the classroom
he presses himself flat against the wall
stay away from me
what the fuck are you involved in
chet do you really think im a terrorist
one of the dumb ones
the ones they convince to wear the bombs
i am not fucking around here
two guys did this to me
and if i dont rob that bank in time this thing is gonna blow
and your first idea was to come to a school filled with young children
i didnt just back the fuck away from me with that thing
will backs all the way up so that the guys are on opposite ends of the classroom
listen i think the vest is safe for now
these guys dont want me to blow myself up on accident before i get their money
oh so you figure the two psychopaths that rigged a bomb to your chest made sure it was safe
theres no margin for error in their fucking bomb vest design
i dont know
all i do know is that this is real
this is happening
and im sure you hate me as much as i hate you right now but i have nowhere else to go
for help chet
i need your help
i cant do this alone
chet looks will over
his desperation is palpable
chet bites his lip weighing the situation
takes a breath id like to tell you to get fucked but you know what the problem is
im a better man than you
and someday i might actually forgive you
so if i let you blow up or whatever that shit might come back and eat at my conscience and totally affect my relationships with other people
like my wife and kids and shit
very rational way to look at the situation
and youre right about being a better guy than me
chet takes a step toward will
are you sure that thing isnt gonna blow at any second
will just looks at chet
unable to offer any assurance
after a beat could you just walk a few feet in front of me for a while
i can do that
will opens the door stops looks back at chet
will heads out
chet takes a breath bracing himself
will walks down the empty hallway
he glances back over his shoulder where chet walks several feet behind him
yes im still here
i really am this stupid
just pay attention to where youre going
i think i can handle it
these floors get waxed once a week
on tuesday which today is
you hit a slick patch trip and fall and i got a classroom full of kids wearing their skin inside out
chet im fucking nervous enough as it is
i dont need you back seat driving me right now
will stops turns back toward chet
just for the record this isnt a nuclear weapon strapped to my chest
and there are metal lockers on either side of the hallway
if i fall and if this thing goes off im probably not taking out the whole school
do you really want to debate this
will sighs turns back around
a second later the school bell rings and kids flood the hallway changing classes
multiple kids shove past him
chet sweats bullets gives will a look of death
after a beat the hallway empties again
youre an asshole
will continues walking
he tries to lighten the mood who was the chick in the white jeans
you know why
oh come on
just keep walking
the guys voices fade as they continue down the hallway
come on yourself
you knew exactly who i was talking about
shes in the eighth grade
i bet you love it when she calls you mr
she doesnt call me mr
shes not a foreigner
the guys get to wills car
chet wraps up a call on his cell thanks so much mrs
ill call you after i talk to the doctor
chet hangs up
he is standing by the passenger door
he looks over the roof of the car at will
so this is it
this is what
once i step inside this car im basically in a steel coffin with you and
and if it goes off all theyre gonna find in there are two charred bodies and pieces of a bomb
theyll assume we were driving to a government building to blow it up
itll be all over the news
next thing you now some militia or islam group is claiming us as members
my family will be humiliated
well also be dead in that particular situation so it wont really matter
i get it
take your time man
will gets in the car and shuts the door
he looks out at chet who stands uncertainly by the passenger side
this is the worlds biggest favor you motherfucker
you didnt even help me move last winter
chet reluctantly hops in
will fires up the engine
given the situation i think you should obey all traffic safety laws
will pulls out of the school parking lot
okay so where are we going
i have no idea
i just got in your car
i thought you had a plan
well i dont
ive been sorta preoccupied with this crushing fear of death
i cant say im surprised
your plan is probably better
just condescend me until i explode
will goes to turn on the radio
chet grabs his hand
maybe we should turn on the radio
see if the signal sets the bomb off
that would be an interesting experiment
will heaves a frustrated sigh
chet eases up
listen lets just go back to my place
figure out our options
maybe you can get the vest off or something
i just dont want to do anything stupid
unless we have to
the car hits a rough pothole
chets heart skips a beat holy fucking shit
and he throws himself against the passenger side window as far from will as the confines of the car will allow
will slams the brakes
youre scaring the fuck out of me
chet makes the sign of the cross
im cool now
will continues driving
chet discreetly unlocks the passenger side door
why did you do that
i saw you
its in case i have to jump out
if i survive the day and you dont because you jumped out of a moving car and broke your neck im gonna laugh my ass off
and if abandoning ship saves my life then that laugh will be mine
the guys continue driving in silence
super countdown hours minutes
the door is shut
will sits on the toilet lid
he has the jacket off and we get our first complete look at the vest
the actual structure is composed of hollow metal tubes
the wiring that runs throughout the vest is messy and complicated purposely so to scare anyone out of fucking with it
will is in the process of trying to contort his arm so he can slide the vest off
its too tight
he is calling off toward the where chet is crouched in a corner at the furthest point in the furthest room from the bathroom
he uses his laptop to look for websites on disarming a bomb
what if we try to separate your shoulder
well all these sites say different shit
theres not a lot of consensus in the bomb disarming community
will emerges from the bathroom sliding the jacket back on
this is pointless
chet shuts his laptop
we gotta call the cops have them fly in the bomb squad or something
these guys said theyd be following me
and i dont have a clue what they look like
for all i know theyre outside right now
they see the cops show up they blow the vest and cut their losses
will stares at chet hopelessly overwhelmed
what do i do man
what do i do now
i dont know will
i guess you gotta rob the bank
i havent been inside a bank in three years
how the fuck am i supposed to rob one
they wouldnt even give me a savings account
will drops onto the couch and puts his head in his hands fighting hysterics
chet offers a stock reassurance its gonna be okay
no its not
im gonna blow up
thats way worse than getting stabbed or shot
at least some people survive that
no one survives being blown up
no one is ever like yeah i heard steve got blown up tough break but hows he doing now
is he still in the rec basketball league
no of course he isnt cause theres nothing left of steve except a stain on the wall and a pair of fucking high tops
chet looks on as his friend begins to sob
its a crushing sight
chet strides across the apartment pull yourself together
and attempts to give him one of those get a grip slaps
but will flinches and chet slaps him right on the ear
i think you popped my eardrum
i didnt mean to do that
but just listen to me now
youre not gonna die
you wanna know why
because you know exactly how to rob a bank
what are you talking about
that movie is like a how to guide for bank robberies
you just bust in
stick to the tellers and dont bother with the vault
i guess its pretty simple right
and its just a local bank
the donner wells on charles road
i applied for a job there like a year ago
you wanted to be a teller
yeah so what
its a good job
you get benefits
like what a name tag
what kind of benefits do you get
thats really clever
no one ever said that shit to me before
anyway this is perfect
you know the whole layout of the bank
they didnt hand me the security schematics with the application
but i sat in the waiting area for like minutes
i know what the place looks like
how many guards
thats a start
its a great start
you can do it
youre gonna do it with me right
i was actually gonna stick to giving tips ideas
more of a consultant or advisory role
jesus christ chet
im begging you here
i need you on this
if i do it alone im dead
are you gonna cry again
that was a moment of weakness
ill fucking cry again if thats what it takes
i should make you blow me
whip that shit out
im actually kinda curious
i wanna see if jenny rifkin lied to you
she obviously lied to me
chet cracks a smile
all these guys want is grand
we can do this
were gonna rob a bank for grand
just leave the rest of the money sitting there
i dont know
i guess theyre very modest criminals
who the fuck cares
you said we right
chet heaves a sigh
im putting my life on the line for grand
what does grand even buy these days
as the car pulls into where juicy waits by the service entrance smoking a cigarette
she spots the car and runs over
it parks and the door opens
a glassy eyed african american man s steps out
his muscled body is covered in calligraphic prison ink
this is vaughn
juicy throws her arms around him
i missed you so much baby
you dont got enough dicks to keep you warm in that place
you know its not like that
those guys get juicy but you get marisol
what i want is to get my money kill that old ass man then get the fuck out of here
then thats how its gonna go
were just waiting on a call
vaughn stares at her
this is my impatient face
well i think i can keep you entertained
juicy gets in the open driver side door and makes a show of crawling over into the passenger seat
fluorescent lights and pop music
will and chet roam the aisles with a full shopping basket
they turn into the sports fitness section where they find a variety of air pistols
they are incredibly realistic though clear and with orange nozzles
should we go with the handguns
or the uzis
thats such a murtaugh choice
a check out conveyor belt as the guys purchases drift past air pistols spray paint ski masks leather gloves several hour energy drinks
the tough register woman looks at the guys with abject disgust
you sure you dont want to grab some condoms
because this is usually what men buy before they rape someone and i want to make sure you all use protection
lady were just
buying some stuff
is that cash or credit for your rape kit
will looks in his empty wallet takes out a credit card
chet grabs his hand
well pay cash
the van is parked
dwayne sits behind the wheel
metallicas ride the lightning begins to play loudly
you really fucked up this mix tape
dwayne ejects the tape tosses it at jay in the passenger seat
were not speed freaks knocking off a eleven
were masterminding a heist here
that song just means a lot to me
dwayne shakes his head
he turns and looks out the windshield theyre parked in the walmart lot watching the store entrance
i wish he would hurry his shit up
you worried about that other guy hes with
he picked him up at a school
so long as there aint any cops he can take the whole town with him
i just want my money
dwayne surveys the area
something catches his attention the bland strip mall across the street
theres a blockbuster subway and an empty space in between
you want me to run over to subway get us a couple sandwiches
if you had any vision jay youd know exactly what im thinking about right now
and its not a sandwich
look how well trafficked that shopping mall is
its the perfect place for the tanning salon
jay checks it out nods
oh youre totally right
ive been thinking about it and i want you to start off working the counter
sounds like a demotion i know but its an important position
because were gonna be using code words and shit
for example if a customer walks in and says he wants a tan that just means he wants a tan
but if he says he wants a deluxe tan that means a blow job and you gotta get one of the girls in there to suck him off
you with me
but what if he wants a fuck
theres gonna be codes for everything missionary anal black chicks
i got it all written down back home in my files
im not gonna bother getting into it with you right now because youre supposed to be on lookout and youre no good at multitasking
cause theyre about to get away
dwayne spots the mustang pulling away
he throws the van into gear
will navigates the streets
chet is in the back seat where he has newspaper spread out and is spray painting the air pistols and much of the car black
be careful youre getting paint everywhere
are you really worried about your upholstery right now
yes because if i survive this shit im quitting my job
that means ill probably have to give up my place and ill be sleeping in the back of my car which youre covering in toxic paint
chet touches up one of the guns goes to flip it over
that side isnt dry yet
youre about to ruin it
it says its fast drying
fast isnt the same as instant
you gotta let it sit for like minutes
how would you know
you do a lot of graffiti
no but i spray painted my bike last year after i got my license suspended
i didnt let it dry properly and i fucked it up
we dont have time to sit around and literally watch paint dry
arent we going straight to the bank
i was actually thinking we need to stop and steal a car first
chet drops the spray paint whirls on will
weve got a car
yeah my car
im not gonna use it as a getaway vehicle
they can trace the plates
even if we do get away well be arrested
well i cant hotwire a fucking automobile and neither can you
thats why i was thinking wed steal one from your parents friends
remember how they used to pay us to clean their garage
they leave the keys in there
and they have a datsun
thats a fast car
im not stealing the fishers datsun
lets steal a car from your parents friends
he whips the car over to the side of the road and gets in chets face
my parents dont have any
my dad moved away after your big mouth ruined his marriage and humiliated him and no one wanted to hang out with the mom who everyone knew fucked a lifeguard
you never should have told me
i was years old
i couldnt process that kind of information
i had to tell someone else
shakes his head fuck
i really am sorry about it
despite what i said before
i was just a kid but i messed up
chet looks at will expectantly
youre not gonna apologize for selling my cal ripken ball
im sorry that my family was going through a rough patch and i was smoking a ton of weed and listening to the wu tang clan all the time
and that i needed some extra dough to indulge my habit
which in hindsight was probably just a cry for help
but you never even noticed
now i feel even worse
will sits there stewing for a moment
then he softens i shouldnt have stolen the ball
i knew it was wrong and i regretted it like the next day
i actually tried to buy it back but the guy wanted twice as much
i had to smoke even more weed just to get past the whole shitty incident
i guess thats why they call it a downward spiral
i appreciate that you tried to buy it back
an awkward moment passes
we should probably get going
will turns back around goes to pull out without looking and
a horn blares as a speeding delivery truck barrels right at them
will slams the brakes barely avoiding a collision
i just want this goddamn day to be over
as chet continues to freak super countdown hours minutes
will keeps watch of the house
chet squeezes through a garage window he has pried open
chet drops ungracefully to the floor right beside a well maintained datsun z
chet hurries over and unlocks the side door
will enters hauling the walmart bag of supplies
he goes right for a set of hooks on the wall
the keys arent here
they always used to leave the keys out
when we were teenagers
this is fucked
lets just find them
the guys ransack the garage
chet knocks over a shelf full of clutter
will goes to the car and tries the handle
he scours the interior
you hear that
chet peeks through the glass pane in the door
fisher is coming
as he looks for an escape oh shit oh shit
are the keys in there
will hops out of the car
he rifles through the walmart bag
what are you doing
will pulls the ski masks out of the bag along with one of the freshly painted air pistols
im doing what i have to
will puts a ski mask on then throws one to chet
the door opens and mr
fisher s enters
chet quickly pulls down his mask
will levels the pistol oh jesus
fisher braces himself against a wall
chet fumbles to turn his mask around
will affects a deep voice where are the car keys
theyre in my pocket
im just reaching in my pocket for the keys
quiet down and do it already
fisher reaches into his pocket and produces the keys
they jingle as he holds them out in his trembling hand
will snatches them
now listen i dont want you to report this car stolen or anything until later tonight
lets say oclock
to be safe
anything you say
will seems unconvinced
he looks to chet who shrugs
will turns back to mr
fisher and gestures violently with the gun if you fuck with us i swear i will
i will shoot your son
i know where he works
at the fucking travel agency
hes the douchebag with the bangs
i wont do anything
just leave taylor alone
im gonna trust you
but if you call the police theres gonna be an undertaker styling his stupid fucking bangs
now open the garage door
fisher hits a switch that raises the garage door
chet grabs their stuff and gets in the passenger side
will backs toward the driver side
the cars insured right
i feel better
worse comes to worst something happens to it you can get a honda
this thing doesnt even have airbags
please just go
will slides into the car and starts it up
the car peels away
the guys yank off their ski masks
that old mans got a heart condition
you could have killed him
my hand was forced
chet tries to get comfortable in the seat
im stuck inside an even smaller car with you and a bomb
will works the manual transmission
he steps on the gas
this things got some pickup
could you just take it easy were doing fine on time
but theres one last stop we have to make
do you have to take a piss first
because i do
will nervously drums his fingers on the steering wheel trying to figure out how to say i need to see your sister
are you for real
did you really just ask me that
you salt in an open wound motherfucker
chet as if it isnt apparent i may die today
ill probably die today
and if theres one small thing thats clear to me now its that ive wasted two and a half decades as a pussy watching everything i want pass me by
i dont wanna peace out of this world as a pussy
i need to tell her how i feel
youre really gonna turn this into some sort of dying wish bullshit
yes i really am
it means that much to me
i am not fucking around here
i dont think you are
i mean apparently you love my sister so much that youre willing to put her life in danger by going to see her with a bomb strapped to your chest
she wont be in danger
i got it all worked out
and you can even take a piss while im inside
the datsun pulls around and parks in back
pull back to reveal the minivan parking across the street
dwayne and jay watch will hurry out of the datsun
where the fuck is he going
whats in there
some sort of fbi headquarters
i told that guy not to fuck around
dwayne pulls out his cell phone punches in the speed dial code
his finger hovers above the send button
maybe i should give that bomb a call
let me just go see what hes up to
i was just fucking around
are you gay for this guy or something
i just wanna get the money dwayne
same as you
then man up and go check it out
as jay reaches for the door handle
dont even tell me youre about to do a reconnaissance without a cover
whats you cover
i dont know
im from the telephone company
yeah nice fucking uniform
dwayne rummages in the back of the car produces a shopping bag and starts filling it with random clothes strewn across the car
he shoves the bag at jay
youre a personal shopper
youre delivering the latest fashions to mr
quilby in marketing
jay nods hops out with the bag and slams the door
dwayne looks down at the cell phone in his hand twirls it as he hums a revival song
sings the lyrics softly hes got the whole world in his hands
hes got whole fucking world in his hands
will runs up the stairs a phone pressed to his ear no im here right now
why are you acting so strange
because strange shit is going on
ill explain everything
just meet me where i texted you
just do it
you can see the entire shitty town from up here
the access door opens and kate emerges wind tousling her short hair
will waves at her from where he is standing way across on the other side of the roof
kate starts toward him
will takes out his cell phone and dials
kates phone rings
she answers it confused
what are you doing
we stay on will
we can see kate standing feet away but her voice comes over wills cell phone with a delay that is slightly jarring
just dont come any closer
whats going on
im gonna give you the short version of an incredibly complicated and fucked up situation so please be cool
some very bad guys strapped a bomb to my chest and they are forcing me to commit a crime
will i swear if this is i wish i was joking but im not
i know its a lot to swallow but you gotta take it on face value because theres a timer attached to this thing and its counting down
kates voice falters oh my god will
well get help
ill get you help
i didnt come here for help
im taking care of it
i came here because should things not work out today as i would like them to i want you to know why i was doing the things i did
please just let me call someone
let me do something
this is crazy
i dont disagree with you
its fucking nuts
but thats not even what this is about
do you remember when you found that picture in my car of you me and chet with chet cut out of it
will i cant remember about some stupid picture while youre i need you to remember about the picture and about how i stop by your office every friday and how
ive always hated all your boyfriends and how the two girls ive ever seriously dated have looked like less attractive versions of you
do you see where im going with this
i love you kate
i have for a very long time
kate is barely holding it together
will this is a lot youre putting on me
you just told me people are trying to kill you or something and now you say you love me
what the fuck is going on
a whole lot of shit
im sorry to do this to you but i was afraid id never get the chance to tell you
and i know you have feelings for me too
maybe you feel for me the way you feel for a good friend or if the world fucking hates me a brother
but what i hope is that you dont really know how you feel for me and that maybe when you figure it out youll realize its the same way i
feel for you
does that make any sense
i mean ive known you forever
its not an easy thing to figure out
i dont need an answer now
just think about it
and no matter what you decide youre too good for assholes like mark and the rest of them
kate manages a small stifled laugh
i will process all of this
its just the bomb its distracting
anyway id love to stay and talk some more but i cant
i gotta ask you to leave now because im running out of time
will hangs up the phone
she turns back toward the access door stops
she yells across the roof at will if i had time to think about it
id probably tell you that ive always felt very strongly for you
and ive never thought of you as a brother
will smiles yells back thats a huge relief
dont say anything else
i just really dont want to die now
try not to
kate turns and continues to the access door
jay paces about the landing that leads up to the roof
he hears the door opening and hurries down to the entrance for the nearest floor
he tries the door but its locked
kate enters the stairwell from the roof access door and spots jay trying to force the door open
she is holding back tears
he just looks incredibly confused
im a personal shopper
im looking for mr
im sorry i dont know who that is
kate continues down the stairs tears coming now
jay waits a beat then hurries down and tries the door on the next level which is open
jay jumps in the van huffing and puffing
it was just his girlfriend or something
getting one last blow job in case he dont make it
i kinda like this guy
will galvanized by the exchange hops inside
did you tell her how you saw her naked when she was
that always works
i said my piece
shes gonna think about it
she was freaked out
by the bomb
would it be so bad if we ended up together
you and i would be family
i dont want you in the family
you bring very little to the table
i want her to be with someone awesome
a pro quarterback
a war hero
at the very least someone ive never watched porn with
well now its up to her
not if i set that bomb off myself
then youd probably never get to rob a bank
will throws the car into gear and pulls away
super countdown hours minutes
the datsun is parked in the half full lot
the guys lean against the driver side with their backs to the bank and the car providing cover
they each have a spray painted air pistol tucked into their pants
you go for the money
ill cover the crowd
in and out
chet clasps his hands around his stomach
im not feeling so good
i drank like three of those hour energy drinks
its just nerves
lets pull our shit together and do this thing
chet reigns it in
the guys slide on the leather gloves and rolled up ski masks
they turn and stride toward the bank
the guys stop as they get to the door
they pull the ski masks down and take out their air pistols
what should i call you in there like if i need to ask you to do something
call me tivon
youll be darius
i can tell youre not a black guy through the ski mask
then youll be luis and im cruz
were two loco motherfuckers and thats the way we gotta roll when we get in there
its business as usual for a dozen customers and about as many employees
they all just want to get done with their shit and go home when will and chet burst through the bank doors guns in hand
everybody put your hands in the air
no get on the ground
actually listen to him and get on the fucking ground
will and chet are on an adrenaline high waving their guns everywhere
will frantically scans the panicked crowd for the security guard s rail thin and jumpy
will points his gun right at him
you just stand right there and dont do shit
the rest of you get the fuck down
spread your arms and legs
why is no one listening to me
just take it easy man
dont be a hero cowboy
what the fuck does that mean
im not a hero
or a cowboy
as people drop to the ground whispering nervously to one chet rushes the tellers standing behind the bulletproof glass partition
all of you back away from the counter and get out here
anyone pushes a button and one of these people gets totally shot
the tellers hurry into the main area of the bank and get onto their stomachs
will looks to the guard
very slowly take out your gun and toss it away
the guard takes out his gun lays it on the ground and shoves it away
the gun slides across the waxed floor and right into the outstretched hand of a sobbing mom s whose daughter lies beside her in a soccer uniform
i dont want the gun
what the fuck
did you do that on purpose
it was an accident
are you guys working together
please take this gun away
just toss it lady
the mom slides the gun away like it were on fire
it skids all the way across the floor slams hard against a wall and ah
a fat man has been shot
he clutches his thigh
i think she got the femoral artery
it was an accident
who slides a gun like that
mommy whats happening
christi be quiet
these men are dangerous
chet turns ashen
he moves close to will whispers urgently this is fucked
that dude is gonna bleed out and were gonna go to prison
just calm down
why is no one getting me help
is anyone here a doctor
just the heavy breathing of many frightened people
will hurries over to the fat man who is bent over hugging his leg
sir let me see where youre hit
just call me an ambulance
calm down sir
the fat man sits up removes his hand from his leg
will nervously takes a look
there is only a small amount of blood
its just a flesh wound
youre gonna be okay
but it hurts so bad
you got shot man
its not supposed to feel good
but youre gonna be fine
and youll have a great story to tell everyone
this is an awful story
this isnt a bank error in my favor
i got shot
luis how we doing on the money
chet snaps back to attention oh shit
chet picks out the most harmless looking teller a mousy something girl and helps her up off the ground
he checks her name tag sandra
i know youre probably scared right now but if you go grab us grand in a bag well get out of here
this will all be over and youll be fine
you trust me
chet smiles reassuringly
she hurries behind the counter starts filling a bank bag with cash as my leg really hurts
can you please hurry up sandra
sandra emerges from behind the partition with the bank bag
will grabs it
he takes a last look at the people spread across the floor
im really sorry everyone
i know we probably fucked up your day
looks to fat man im thinking of you in particular sir
actually you know what
will crosses to the fat man offers the bank bag
peel a few bills
anyone rats him to the cops and im coming for you
i remember faces
the fat man hesitantly reaches for the bag
opens it red dye explodes all over his face
chet whirls on the teller
what the fuck was that about sandra
i thought we had something going
what happened to trust
they make us do it
could you kindly fill another bag
not a bank bag
a fucking garbage bag
and luis will you watch her this time
sandra hurries back behind the partition with chet
he dumps out the contents of a trash can grabs the bag and watches closely as sandra stuffs it with cash
that should be enough
chet grabs the bag and hustles out toward will
they are home free until they hear the wail of approaching sirens outside
they stop cold panicked
will whirls on the tellers
which one of you assholes tripped the alarm
was it you sandra
it was mark
he pushed the button when you guys came in
another teller mark looks up from the floor
sandra you bitch
now theyre gonna kill us both
fuck you mark
youre the manager
will loses his shit fuck both of you
fuck all of you
im a regular guy
just like you
im a regular guy and you fucked me
thank you for fucking a regular guy
people are freaked out
sandra is crying thinking she will probably get shot now
chet grabs will and pulls him toward the door
lets just get the fuck out of here
the guys slam through the doors out into just as a lone police cruiser screeches into the lot
will and chet make a run for it but the cruiser cuts them off
officer zurman a jittery rookie jumps out of the cruiser and levels his gun
the guys reflexively level theirs
drop your weapons
dont shoot us
drop the guns or ill have to
chet looks at will with utter desperation
in the distance they hear the sirens of more cops approaching
will tosses his gun rips open his jacket and grabs a cluster of wires
you just brought a gun to a bomb fight officer
i pull these wires out and we all go
you got ten seconds to drop your gun and zurman doesnt stick around for the rest
he turns and sprints away
as the guys make for the datsun that was awesome
he was tempting a desperate motherfucker
the guys jump in the datsun and peel out as two more police cruisers race toward the bank
the cruisers change course and give chase
the datsun blows right by the parked dwayne watches as the cars speed off into the distance
our boy is causing some serious mayhem
hes gonna get caught or killed
dwayne whirls on jay punches him hard in the shoulder
shut the fuck up
if you jinx this with your negativity im gonna strap a bomb to your chest next
jay massages his shoulder pissed
oh yeah whos gonna build it
whiplash blur as the three cars race by one after the other
airborne leaves flutter in their wake
chet freaks out as they hurtle toward lunchtime traffic
will weaves in and out of cars
this is not cool
will is wild eyed punching the gas
chets head is on a swivel
behind them police cruisers in hot pursuit
up ahead the world rushing at them at mph populated by nothing but potential collisions that will result in a fiery death
maybe we should pull over and surrender
i can outrun these guys
theyre not the fbi theyre local cops
just shut up and let me concentrate
i do this for a living
as they clip the side view mirror off a kia you dont do anything like this for a living
i am not a pizza i am a man
the cruisers are gaining ground throttles wide open
will downshifts spiking the rpms into the red as he banks a hard right and the datsun explodes onto a crowded street
pedestrians crossing an intersection jump out of its way
the cruisers take the turn into town
one makes it
the other slams into parked cars
will jumps the curb to avoid slow moving traffic slams into a newspaper dispenser
it flips up onto the hood and crashes into the windshield where it stays lodged
will veers back into the street and blindly plows ahead as cars he cannot see swerve to avoid him
he finally slams the brakes the momentum knocking the dispenser loose and launching it onto the sidewalk scattering pedestrians
chet whirls around to see the cruiser flying right at them
will steps on the gas
the light ahead turns red
will rolls the dice and blows through the intersection
the cruiser behind him is not
its t boned by traffic in a brutal crunching collision
the cruiser wreckage disappears in the rear view mirror as will floors it toward a green light
that guy got fucked up
in the rushing moment as they cross the intersection chet glimpses the other cruiser barreling toward his side of the car from the perpendicular street
he has a millisecond maybe to process their impending doom and then the cruiser smashes into the back passenger side of the car
the datsun is sent spinning like a fucking top
its ruined back wheel catches sending the car tumbling onto its roof
the guys scream as the car continues to slide upside down out of control
as it slams into a row of parking meters the world goes will blinks back to reality
hes hanging inverted by his seat belt
the car is a pool of shattered glass
it twinkles up at him
hours could have passed but its only been seconds
he sucks in air
satisfied that he is in fact still alive he looks over at a battered and bruised chet head drooping straight back
are you okay
oh my god
talk to me
i thought you were gonna blow up
wills hands go to the bomb
luckily your side took most of the impact
we gotta keep moving
will unclicks his seat belt and falls to the roof of the car
he moves to chet unclicks his belt and helps him down
will emerges from the overturned car
he drags chet out along with the bag of cash
he glances up to see the officer who crashed into them stumbling out of his own ruined car which has turned a fire hydrant into a geyser
another cruiser races to the scene
oh fuck man
will pulls chet to his feet and they take off rounding a as will huffs and puffs chet
i dont know how to tell you this
but you got a piece of the car in you
in your back
chet glances back to see a jagged piece of metal sticking out of his shoulder blade
get it out
do it now
without breaking stride will yanks the piece of metal out of chets back
is it rusty
am i gonna get tetanus
behind them two officers turn into the alley in full sprint
they are way faster than the guys and soon gain on them
will can barely keep up with chet
why are you moving so slowly
its a combination of cheap sneakers and this heavy fucking bomb on my chest
they burst out of the alley onto the guys frantically search for an escape spot a bus pulling up to a stop down the street
they sprint for the the bus peeling off their ski masks and waving as it lazily rolls away from the stop
the bus slows and the guys trip over each other to board it
the guys fall into seats gasping for air a complete mess
will looks out the window to see the officers emerge from the alley and look around for them
a crowd has grown around the crash sites
fire trucks and ambulances are on the scene
dwayne and jay make their way through the crowd trying to see whats what
dwayne approaches a random local
you hear what happened to the guys they were after
sounds like they got away
dwayne and jay beam
the guys are covered in sweat as they hike along eyes on the lookout
they arrive at wills parked mustang
will hugs the car
i never thought id see you again
i thought you hated this car
its actually not that bad
you know as compared to that datsun
the mustangs got more comfortable seats
and it never would have flipped over
the guys get in
they sit there for a moment silent except for their heavy breathing
wills eyes go to the garbage bag sitting between them
theres a grand in there
which we stole
from a bank
i told a bunch of people i was gonna shoot someone
i was like you fucking move and i will kill you where you stand
i threatened to blow up a cop
and you never said i will kill you where you stand
but shit did get pretty crazy
yeah it did
will starts to get a little emotional
you know theres no one i would have rather taken down a fucking bank with
i mean that
and as for all that shit i said
and all that shit i did
i hope you can forgive me
weve been friends for so long and i guess you hurt the people youre closest to the most
i messed up too
im a dude who slept with his best friends ex girlfriend and destroyed his parents marriage and sat on the sidelines watching his downward spiral
im a shitty human being
but im glad you know that now because you can accept me for who i am
i accept you
because you accept me
will goes in for a hug
chet gets lost in the moment before recoiling
you still got a bomb on you
lets take care of that
but you owe me a hug
will pulls the slip of paper dwayne gave him from his pocket
its all gravy from here
will takes out his cell and dials the number
dwayne and jay cross toward a mcdonalds
dwayne stops and answers his vibrating cell phone
this who i think it is
cant you hear the ticking in the background
you know youre a pretty funny guy
im happy to entertain a complete psychopath
now wait a second youre the murderer
whats that supposed to mean
one of those cops who wrecked his car chasing you
he aint breathing no more
will goes white covers the phone and whispers to chet we killed a cop
you were driving
im just an accomplice
theyre gonna hunt us down and kill us
cops dont take this shit lightly
i bet he had like eight kids
we have to find them and support his family forever
dwayne is holding back laughter
finally bursts out
whats so fucking funny
im just messin with you
you didnt kill anyone
howd a moron like you manage to rob a bank
can we just get this over with
where do you want the money
theres a boarded up gas station out on commerce avenue past the highway
be there in minutes
ill be there in ten
then youll be standing around with your dick in one hand and my money in the other
dwayne hangs up
he dials another number yo juicy wrangle your boy
moneys on its way
the mustang shrieks past us
super countdown hours minutes
dwayne and jay sit at a table with a fast food feast spread out
dwayne eats a big mac a look of utter satisfaction on his face a man whom the gods have finally smiled down upon
i remember the summer after my mother passed was the first year they had the monopoly game at mcdonalds
i musta come here three times a day trying to collect all the game pieces
packed on pounds got acne from all the grease
the major said i was the fattest ugliest year old he ever laid eyes on
but i didnt care i just wanted to win the money and get the fuck out of there
so one night i followed this skinny register kid home jumped him
i kept whaling on him asking him where they were hiding the park place piece
the million dollar prize
but he didnt know shit
a year later the major won the lotto
i asked him for a sega genesis
he bought me one of those paddles with the ball attached
dwayne goes for a fry sees his carton is empty and grabs a handful of jays
im not ashamed to admit that ive gone through some dark times since then
addiction to a variety of shit which i wont go into
i know you must think thats pretty silly especially since you manage to get through the day and you dont got shit going on as compared to me
but thats just the way it is
jay looks pretty affected that dwayne is opening up to him
you know ive been pretty low too
if you ever want to talk about that kinda stuff
my whole point i was trying to make before you interrupted me was that that shit is all in the past
cause i did it
i finally pulled it off
we pulled it off dwayne
the two us
were a good team
would you do anything to protect me my money my empire
i mean like what kinda stuff are we talking about
dwayne takes out his cell keys in the speed dial code and slides the cell across the table to jay
would you push the button
why would you want me to do that
its just a question jay
if i asked you
i mean its no different than those watermelons
watermelons arent alive
yeah they are
not the ones you blew up though
dwayne stares hard at jay
a tense beat
no one gets hurt
i forgot about that part
dwayne cracks a smile
anyway he hasnt even made the drop yet
im gonna go take a shit
stay away from the bathroom
someone could get hurt
dwayne heads off
jay eyes the cell phone he has left behind
weeds have overtaken the abandoned place
will leans against his parked car waiting
chet is nowhere to be seen
will spots vaughns sentra approach
it pulls into the station and vaughn steps
he could not look more menacing
juicy hangs back in the passenger seat
where are the other guys
im the only guy
you got it
will picks up the garbage bag at his feet and walks it over to vaughn
he opens it looks in
what the fuck did you do
rob a bank
now wheres the code
i dont have any code
vaughn turns to leave
will grabs his arm
vaughn stops looks purposefully down at wills hand
will draws back
listen man i just want the code
i dont know what the fuck youre talking about
the code for the fucking bomb
will opens his jacket
vaughn takes a sudden step back
what kind of stupid motherfucker wears a bomb to a drop
your boss put this on me
i am my boss
then give me the code
motherfucker i dont know no goddamn code
whoever told you i did lied to you
now step the fuck off or ill shoot you in the face so you dont explode and mess up my boots
vaughn goes to leave again
will runs ahead of him and gets in his way
if you dont have the code i want that money back
the only way youre getting this money back is if you kill me
you dont know what ive gone through for that money
in an instant vaughn has his gun out aimed at wills head
do i look sympathetic
now step the fuck aside
juicy looks on with interest as vaughn holds will at gunpoint
then she spots chet creeping up behind vaughn from wherever he was hiding clutching a large metal pipe
juicy jumps out of the sentra
vaughn look out
vaughn whirls around toward chet just in time to have his gun arm smashed by the pipe
the weapon drops from his hand
chet takes another swing cracking vaughn across the face
he howls blood spraying and topples over
chet goes for another swing when juicy jumps on him wildly biting and clawing
will grabs the back of juicys track jacket for leverage and flings her away
she hits the back of the sentra and careens clear across the trunk
will grabs the money
chet kicks vaughns gun into the bushes
the guys break for the mustang and get in
juicy gets to her feet runs right by a dazed vaughn and after the car which pulls out into the road and leaves her behind screaming and cursing
wills mind is racing
what the fuck was that
they tried to screw us
youre a liability
they were just gonna let you blow up
not with the money they wont
a tidy space filled with various half finished devices action figures and heavy metal posters
a low mechanical hum registers
dwayne sits on a stool in the center of the garage while jay carefully trims his hair with an electric clipper
dwayne holds up a mirror to check out his work
never comes out this nice when i do it myself
you might wanna take some more off the top though
i wanna look real professional when i go down to the morgue to identify the body
dwaynes phone chimes from a nearby counter
he grabs it looks at the incoming number slightly concerned
he answers you drop the money yet
will yells into the phone no
ive still got the money
and i cracked your friends face open
why the fuck would you do that
you said id get the code
dwayne is panicked covers badly i gave him the code
he told me he committed it to memory
he was probably just embarrassed that he forgot it
ill call him up and you didnt give him shit
i want the code now or youll never see this money
hold on there big man
you got a bomb on you
i got a cell phone that detonates it
youre not exactly negotiating from a position of leverage
im holding the money
i blow up and it blows up
who has the leverage now
go ahead and push the button you idiot
chet freaks out dont tell him to push the button
dwayne is getting pissed off
why dont you watch what the fuck you say
i own you
i tell you to rob a bank and you rob a bank
i tell you to give me the money and you give me the goddamn money and hope i show you some mercy
im tired of this bullshit
im already dead right
so fuck you
at least ill die rich
i cant say the same for you
the line goes dead
dwayne tears off his haircut smock
that piece of shit hung up on me
chet grabs the wheel and forces will to pull over
get me out of this car
chet jumps out while the mustang is still slowing down
he runs yards away
will turns the car off and gets out
that was colossally stupid
it was a negotiation tactic
hell call back and i wont answer
then hell call back and i will answer and hell realize the only way he gets the money is if he gives me the code
that seems like a perfectly logical pattern of thought
i bet thats exactly what hell do
dwayne tries wills phone again
it goes to voicemail
he explodes like a pack of mentos in a two liter of diet coke
throws his cell across the room
overturns a work table
does this guy know who the fuck i am
jay retreats into a corner
dwaynes a big boy and he soon tires himself out hunches over panting
you never told me you werent going to give him the code
were not amateurs
he was a loose end
i let him live someday i woulda been walking out of my mansion and
fbi cia nsa all converging on my front lawn cause a loose end turned states evidence and they got what they need to put me away
dwayne shakes his head
starts digging through the mess hes made
finds his phone
fuck it jay
ill just kill the major myself
dwayne keys in the speed dial code
dont do it
dwayne looks down at the send button
you know what they say about a tree falling in the forest
maybe the same thing applies to blowing up some motherfucker across town
maybe it doesnt even make a sound
dwayne hits send
but dwayne notices something
the phone in his hand is ringing
he puts it to his ear
the line connects hello
who is this
dwayne snaps the phone shut looks to jay who tries to will the beads of sweat back into his pores
who did i just call jay
cause she sounded cute for a bomb
my seventh grade crush
or whoever lives in gina kims house now
wheres the number for the bomb
in my head
i switched it out of your phone while you were taking a shit
youre out of control dwayne
im in perfect control
dwayne charges jay
jay holds up the hair clippers like a weapon flicks them on
dwayne rips the cord out of the wall uses it to yank the clippers from jays hand then whips him with the cord
dwayne goes to whip jay again but jay moves like a jack rabbit and delivers a fierce kidney shot
dwayne stumbles backward falls onto the couch groans you asshole
i make you my partner and you pull this shit
im tired of you pushing me around all the time
what kinda partner does that
im gonna piss blood arent i
thats what it said on the internet
dwaynes phone rings in his pocket
get it out for me
i can barely move
jay pulls the cell from dwaynes pocket
opens it and puts it to his ear so he can answer glad you came to your senses
vaughn has a rag pressed to his swollen bloody face
juicy is nearby banged up and dirty
vaughn yells into his cell who the fuck do you think youre talking to
i honestly dont know
let me give you a hint your boy just jumped me tossed my bitch like a rag doll and split with the cash
dwayne realizes whos on the other line recovers that guys not my boy
hes a dick
im sorry for all the uh confusion
the only motherfucker thats confused is you
apparently you think you can fuck me and survive the day
i wasnt fucking you i was fucking him
you gotta understand youre like a pawn in a much larger game im playing here
did you just call me a pawn you stupid fuck
i didnt mean it like that
im just juggling a whole lot of shit
i want my money
that may not be possible
i just want to put this out there to keep you in the loop
but i may need to bump the hit
vaughn paces furious
this isnt a reservation at sizzler
you dont bump it
i want you to bring me my money right now to where i am standing in this shit hole town bleeding from the motherfucking face
i dont exactly have the money
give me some time and the deals off
you just became the hit
vaughn hangs up tosses the bloody rag to the ground and screams in frustration
he lives with his daddy
you already got the address
dwayne looks down at his phone
the assassins gonna kill me now
im gonna die
game fucking over
dwayne cradles his arms around his wounded kidney rocks back and forth wallowing in defeat
we can still get him the money
try the pizza guy back
so he can fuck around again and i wind up dead anyway
id rather just sit here
i want to die right here on this couch
were gonna get that money
just like we planned
all we gotta do is get the leverage back
how do we do that
pizza boys obviously got some kinda death wish
jay gathers his resolve
we take the girl
the one he went to see
then he wont try shit
dwayne looks up at jay with something not unlike awe
thats a great fucking idea jay
its the best idea anyones had all day
dwayne lowers his head
he removes the gun from his belt
holds it out to jay
jay takes it
feels its weight
then offers it back
i was just trying to figure out how you would do it dwayne
dwayne takes the gun
struggles to stand
jay helps him
then lets do it right
we leave nothing to chance
because if we go to prison for this i wont be able to watch out for you
dwayne looks over at a frame backpack hanging from a hook on the wall
pvc piping bulges from it
you should probably bring the flamethrower buddy
theres gonna be some evidence to dispose of
will and chet sit on the ground still yards apart
chet checks his watch
its been half an hour
in another minutes im calling the bomb squad
chet gestures to the vast emptiness all around them
these guys obviously arent watching you anymore
you know even if they get the bomb squad here in time and they can somehow get this thing off me we still gotta answer for the robbery
ill take the heat with you will
ill tell them i forced you into it
that you didnt have a choice
will looks at chet for a beat
youre not gonna think about it a little longer
after all we went through
tear down the relationship rebuild it
youre gonna let me go to prison alone
it was a test
your grade f minus
you know what the f is for
to fuck myself
you passed that test
failed the important one
as the guys continue to argue super countdown hour minutes
kate walks down a hallway turns into an office
two figures rush past from the intersecting hallway and duck behind a corner
kate emerges from the office and continues into kate goes to the mirror checks herself out
shes been crying
she splashes water on her face then enters a stall
the bathroom door opens and dwayne and jay enter
dwayne pulls something hairy from his pocket
inside the stall kate reaches for some toilet paper
from underneath the barrier she notices two pairs of dirty masculine sneakers
her breath goes shallow
she takes out her cell quietly opens it
she presses the first in but her keypad volume is on and the phone makes a dull electronic beep that echoes in the quiet bathroom
why dont you just slide the phone under the door so i dont have to kick it open and see you with your panties down
kate slides the phone out
one of the sneakers crushes it
she gets off the toilet arranges her clothing and steps out out of the stall
she gasps at the two ominous men standing there in gorilla masks
dwaynes gun is plainly visible tucked into the front of his pants
whats the quietest way out of the building
cause i might get excited in a confrontation and you might wind up shot in the face
the major is watching reruns of threes company
he doesnt laugh or remotely smile at any of it
the subtle click of a door opening does not escape his finely tuned senses
the major gets up and goes to a desk rifles through a drawer and pulls something out
a simple pen
he clutches it like a weapon
the major creeps along
just stay where you are old man
the major turns to find vaughn pointing a gun at him
im looking for your son
even if i knew where he was i wouldnt tell you nothing
dont be stupid
you know i saved a black mans life in the shit
so if i took yours id be even
i see where your son gets his common sense
but you might want to readjust your attitude because i aint fucking around
i want dwayne
i dont know why youd want to protect him the motherfucker hired me to kill you
if this news has any effect at all on the major he doesnt show it
just tell me where he is
vaughn pulls back the hammer of his gun
you think im scared of death
theres a whole generation of gooks that think im the grim reaper
vaughn shakes his head
almost imperceptibly the major repositions the hand with the pen in it
vaughn is about to squeeze the trigger but the major beats him to it clicking the pen which is actually a pen gun
it fires a
caliber round into vaughns neck
he drops the gun and clutches the geyser of blood
the major charges vaughn jumps on him and wrestles him to the ground trying to jam the pen into the wound in his neck
ill ride you all the way to hell
i know exactly how to get there
vaughn reaches for his gun
his fingers curl around it and he whips it across the majors face knocking him backwards
vaughn scrambles to his feet gun pointed at the felled major
what now old man
you cant kill me
none of yall can kill me
the major looks up at vaughn once again face to face with a loaded weapon
go on and the major goes limp one searing hole in his chest
vaughn clasps a hand to his neck to staunch the flow of blood
he steps over the the majors body and continues upstairs
vaughn rifles through the cabinets dumps all of the first aid supplies into the sink
he gets to work on his wound
the locked door is kicked open
vaughn neck crudely bandaged flicks on the lights and looks around the childish room
chinese fighting fish swim in a large tank seem to stop and look out at him like guard dogs
vaughn ransacks the place
he finds a desk drawer locked
takes out his gun and blows it open
vaughn pulls a stuffed file folder out of the drawer
flips through it
its full of details about dwaynes plan the tanning salon etc
motherfucker has lost his mind
he finds a map of the town in the file
three locations are highlighted the bank the boarded up gas station and the radio tower
push in on the radio tower
vaughn stuffs the map into his pocket
he stops before leaving the room turns and shatters the fish tank with the butt of his gun
water spills out and the chinese fighting fish flop onto the floor
as vaughn lifts a boot to stomp them will and chet are still arguing look at the upshot while youre behind bars you can finally finish your degree
if i was there too it would just be a distraction
great idea chet
thanks a lot
ill just sit here and figure out a fucking major
after a beat his hand goes to his pocket
he pulls out his cell
hey its them
will answers you ready to talk now
dwayne drives with his cell pressed to his ear
jay keeps watch on kate in back
she is blindfolded hands bound behind her back with duct tape
yeah im ready to talk
i want my money
meet me back at the radio tower in minutes
ive barely got an hour left
thats the point
i want you on a short leash
give me the code first
then you can have your money
youll just have to trust me when i say that i dont want it
yeah im sure
you just wanna go back to your fantastic life
your great job
and that blonde bitch with the sexy voice
wills mind jumps to the only logical conclusion
roller coaster stomach drop
his voice cracks as he asks a useless what the fuck is that supposed to mean
it means that girl you paid a visit to today is sitting in the back of my van right now
and it aint exactly consensual
you crossed a line
dwayne just laughs maniacally
there are no lines
theres just me and you and thousand dollars
once we get that shit in order you can have her back and your life too
so youre gonna show up where i say when i say
and if you try anything stupid the two of you will be delivering pizzas to saint peter
let me talk to her
you got ten seconds
dwayne hands the phone back to jay who puts it to kates ear
she is trembling
kate im so sorry
im just really dwayne snatches the phone
shes just really gonna die if you fuck this up
will absorbs this like a blow to the chest
the line disconnects
they have kate
what the fuck does that mean
they took her man
they must have followed us to her office
you had to go see her
i messed up
i finally messed up worse than i could have possibly imagined
we gotta get her back will
these guys are crazy
we still got the money
as long as we have that shes alive
chet grabs the bag of cash
they hustle into the car and it peels out leaving behind a swirling cloud of dust
as the sun begins to set super countdown minutes
two menacing headlights come at us on the empty road
they vaughn holds up dwaynes map as he drives
he seems to be on the right road headed for the radio tower
he crumples the map and throws it in back
the mustang stops by the gate to the radio tower
chet jumps out and disappears into the bushes
the mustang pulls up
will gets out and looks around the deserted place
he holds up the money bag
in the shadow of the nearby shed the minivan is revealed as its interior lights come on
the door opens and dwayne emerges in his mask
how much time you got left
will takes off the jacket and tosses it to the ground
he looks at the timer
maybe we should just wait around for the money shot
the guys meet in a clearing
dwayne nods at the bag
that the money
wheres the girl
in the van
get her out here
youre wasting time
will grips the bag close to him
the minivan door opens and jay steps out
strapped to his back is the frame pack we saw at his workshop
a long tube connects the pack to the handle of a metal pipe like device in his hand
jay helps kate still bound and blindfolded out of the van
they approach dwayne and take up position behind him
will are you there
its gonna be okay
this is a fucking tearjerker
just let her come over here
but you should know my associate over there is packing a flamethrower
jay aims the metal device he has been holding
he hits a button and a pilot light comes on
just do what we say
dont mess around or anything
unless either of you can outrun a foot flame
gestures to gun in his belt or a bullet
dwayne roughly pulls kate away from jay and shoves her forward
will grabs her pulls her blindfold off and pushes her behind him
i gave you the girl
now give me the money
how about we get the code out of the way first since this bomb happens to be ticking so close to all of us
dwayne pulls a slip of paper from his pocket
you ready to be a free man
just give it to me
will keys in the numbers
the timer freezes and the lock at the hinge opens
will carefully extricates himself from the vest
he lays it down on the ground and steps away from it
his shirt is drenched in sweat from where the bomb sat
will takes a final look at the money bag then throws it to dwayne
he looks inside smiles
jay takes a peak
its so fucking pretty aint it
dwayne looks up at will
okay you can get out of here now
i actually have this sneaking suspicion that once we turn around youre gonna put a bullet in both of our backs and this is just a guess burn our bodies
they say great minds think alike
and in this case so do we
i figured as much
thats why i got a gun pointed at you too
i got a sniper in the bushes locked on you right now
do i look that dumb
i cant tell youre wearing a mask
before dwayne can react he stops and blinks something shining in his eyes
on your forehead
dwaynes eyes turn upward just barely making out the red dot that dances on his forehead
son of a bitch
in the bushes hidden from sight chet carefully aims his laser pointer at dwaynes forehead
will grins at dwayne
were gonna walk out of here now
if you shoot my sniper shoots
i cant guarantee hell get both of you
but hell definitely get you
as will turns away
hold the fuck up
vaughn emerges from the darkness
he looks at will
wasnt expecting to see you here
without warning vaughn cracks will over the head with the butt of his gun
he goes down hard
vaughn points the gun at her and she shuts up
dwayne steps forward with the bag
its all good
we got your money
nice mask dwayne
now throw the money over here
as soon as the bag lands vaughn aims the gun at him
you dont have to do this
i just paid you
kate looks on terrified an unconscious will at her side
vaughns eyes burn a hole through dwayne
ive been hit with a pipe shot with a pen and wasted my whole motherfucking day
all because of you and this job
i dont know what youre talking about
just take the money
and then im gonna tie up the two loose ends in the gorilla masks
im not a loose end
youre a fucking idiot
you are as loose as ends get
panicked dwaynes eyes flash over to jay who tightens his grip on the flamethrower handle
jay catches dwaynes eye
vaughn sees this
what the jay rears up with the flamethrower
vaughn couldnt be more surprised to see the device jay is holding spit a massive ball of fire at him
vaughn dives to the ground fires off two wild shots one of nails dwayne in the shoulder spinning him backward and knocking him off his feet
kate recoils in horror as vaughn scurries madly on the ground intermittently firing while jay screams and tries to torch him with the foot flame
a hand touches kates shoulder and she whirls around to find chet
what are you doing here
we gotta take off
kate looks to the empty spot beside her where will just was
flames inches from him vaughn lines up a desperate shot good news the bullet only grazes jays side
bad news it keeps going and punches through the flamethrower backpack which happens to be filled with gasoline which happens to have an incredibly low flash point
so the spark from say a bullet would cause meanwhile will pops up behind chet and kate clutching the garbage bag
i got the money
lets get the fuck out of here
they take off toward wills car
dwayne groggily comes to
no sound just a ringing
the first thing he sees vaughn storming toward him god knows what spewing from his mouth
vaughn levels his gun it doesnt make a sound for two reasons
the second being that its out of bullets
dwayne fumbles for his own hardware
vaughn drops to his knees
pulse snatched from him
sound slams back to the tune of jays screams
dwayne looks over to see his friend in flames flailing his arms and shrieking
dwaynes head snaps to the other side where he sees the mustangs tires peel
he tears off his mask frantically looks around
the money is gone
jay disentangles himself from the backpack the source of the flames but his clothes are now ablaze
in his frenzy he somehow manages to string together two coherent words dwayne
dwayne gets to his feet as the mustang roars down the driveway
he looks to jay then to his minivan
dwaynes face two roads diverge in a wood
which to take
goddamn it jay
dwayne sprints over to jay rips off his jacket and uses it to beat the flames down
stop drop and roll
jay hits the deck
dwayne continues fighting the flames finally falls on top of jay with the jacket spread and smothers the last of them out
jay looks up at dwayne with puppy dog eyes
you came back for me
you said you never would
you didnt hesitate back there jay
you did good
flames overtake the field all around them
im gonna go put a bullet in that motherfucker and get our money
think you can get outta here
go get him
dwayne hurries toward the minivan
jay stumbles up to his feet and limps off toward the woods
the mustang travels away from the rising flames
wills face is a mess of dirt sweat and dried blood
he and chet stare ahead completely shell shocked
kate looks from one of them to the other
i just got kidnapped
yeah that was totally wills fault
in case you want to factor that in while youre mulling over the whole relationship thing
im very sorry about the kidnapping
this is me taking responsibility for it
like a viable life partner
this man has spied on you in the nude before
no i didnt
hes trying to build a relationship on a foundation of lies
and it wont stand
i just got kidnapped
can we talk about that
something catches wills attention a set of headlights rapidly growing larger in the rear view mirror
dwaynes speedometer is buried past mph
his eyes burn with intensity
will hits the gas
one of those dudes is definitely not dead
chet and kate look out the back window
chet screams hurry up
hes already on us
dwaynes car pulls even with the mustang
will looks over at dwayne who pulls out his gun and takes aim
he flashes a sick grin i own this town
before dwayne can get a shot off an explosion rocks the minivan from inside
the back end is lifted off the ground and the car tumbles over itself
it lands on its roof and skids into a ditch
chet and kate watch the burning wreck disappear out the back window
they are equal parts confused and happy to be alive
what the hell was that
that was the bomb i carried around all day
i reactivated it and put it in the back of his van
i guess his time was up
his time was up
were you thinking that up the whole day
i was prepared yes
i cant help it if im the kind of guy who thinks about the future
hes not that kind of guy
he doesnt think about the future
what exactly happened since i saw you this afternoon
primarily we robbed a bank
so youre like fugitives
what do we do now
what does the future hold
nothing good if we stay in town and they pin this on us
kate i think you should put in for that vacation time
if anyone gives you a problem tell them to fuck off
theres grand in that trash bag by your feet
a third of its yours
kate opens the bag
smiles through the dirt and grime
will thats fucked up
why does she get a share
why do you get a share
will catches kates eyes in the rear view
airports minutes away
pick a destination
this time its not a practice run
the car zooms off
super countdown hours minutes
wind fans the flames of the burning minivan
the shattered windshield sprouts another crack
then another as dwaynes foot kicks it out
he drags himself from the smoldering steel carcass
he is a charred blood splattered mess but he is alive
dwayne is propped up against a sign lingering on the edge of consciousness
the headlights of a lone pickup truck approach
dwayne feebly waves the truck down for a ride
the door opens and dwayne stumbles through
he has made it home
he drops like a puppet whose strings have been cut
from where his head has landed on the floor dwayne sees something odd
long red streaks
he crawls forward on all fours to investigate
it is a trail of sticky red blood
dwayne follows it until he comes upon its source
the crumpled body of his father lying face down
dwaynes face shock and confusion and joy
dwayne inches closer pokes the body
dad are you the body emits a low groan
dwayne rolls it over
his fathers face is white hes lost a lot of blood but he isnt totally spent yet
he struggles to speak dwayne
what happened to you
said you hired him to kill me
look at you
lip quivering like youre getting fucked
be a man
i am a man
i killed you didnt i
now im gonna use your money to open a tanning salon where they let you fuck the chicks
this stirs something in the major
like those whorehouses
i used to tell you about
dwayne softens at the recollection
those were great bedtime stories
the major nods
opens his hand
reveals a cordless phone
dwayne looks to the bloody streaks down the hall leading to the phone table
the major dragged himself the whole way
medics are late
probably a couple lazy spicks
you tell em i said so
all right son
sure thing pop
the major looks up at dwaynes bruised face as if for the first time
hell of thing
i think i may
actually respect you now
dwaynes eyes well up
he reaches out cradles his father as he expires
its like a very bloody white trash version of the pieta
dwayne sobs uncontrollably until he drops his father and pound pound pounds his chest in some approximation of a life saving resuscitation
get up you pussy
come on soldier
pull away as dwayne pounds the body and distant sirens grow nearer
its the ocean long past sunset
pull back to find a lone figure staring out at it sitting on will
could be anywhere
chet approaches and sits beside him
fucking nine dollars to use the internet
police think it was that black guy
they found some kind of map in his car
and im sure racial profiling played a part
but nothing about us
guess its time to head back
i was thinking wed stick around a little a longer
so you have more time to delude my sister
and itd be easier if you gave us five fucking minutes alone
chet stares out at the ocean for a beat
you really think shes into you
i kissed her last night
then you walked in
chet just nods
will gets up
youre gonna go fuck my sister now arent you
ill be thinking of you the whole time
at the very least
be a considerate lover
give pleasure before taking pleasure
i think im reading you
and i will try my best
will heads up a trail that leads to a hotel bungalow
kate opens the door steps out onto the porch
will stops looks back at chet
you always have been
chet smiles shakes his head as will reaches the porch
he stands close to kate
his nerves clock overtime
i lied and told your brother i kissed you
i thought it would make this easier
heres an idea pretend you have a bomb strapped to your chest
tick will closes the gap and kisses her
after a beat is chet watching us
we should go inside
i promised him id satisfy you
kate laughs leads him inside and the door shuts to
but they are pushed to one side of the screen as the other side is filled with a lo fi style light tunnel
it deposits us in the furthest reaches of the galaxy where we find a tanning bed
rotating in orbit
dwaynes voice booms and the tanning bed explodes like a star gone supernova
from the light and fire and chaos
emerges a logo a bad match cut takes us to the same logo
camera zooms out unsteadily to reveal it is a banner above a strip mall storefront
we are watching a local commercial with appropriately poor production value
dwayne walks backward down a hallway while addressing camera and trying not to trip here at major tan our specially trained technicians are hard at work developing new technologies that
harness the power of the sun to ensure a cutting edge tanning experience
dwayne enters a tanning room
a man in a lab coat stares down at a clipboard on which a complicated scientific equation is written
hows it looking
the man turns its jay
his smiling face is speckled with healing burn wounds
its our most advanced tanning bed yet
he gestures to a very ordinary looking tanning bed
hey dont just take this scientists word for it
dwayne snaps his fingers
a bad special effect makes him disappear then reappear with a totally orange tan
is in the tan
we follow dwayne back out into the hallway
but major tan isnt just about looking good
its also about feeling good
dwayne gestures to another room
the door opens and juicy saunters out in a bikini
a beat later a random guy exits
that deluxe tan was fantastic
dwayne stands outside the store
so come on down to major tan
where were proud to be a family business
pull back to reveal
the major beside dwayne
hes only about four feet tall now on account of the wheelchair
but hes grinning like a jackal in a pow mia cap
a supered logo appears military discounts available
