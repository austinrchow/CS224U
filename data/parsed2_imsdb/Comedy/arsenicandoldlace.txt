the camera moves away so we can see the other baseball spectators behind the first one
general view of a baseball field where a game is being played
follow several very quick sequences one or two seconds each a general view of the spectators
then a player throwing a ball
then a very excited brass band playing
then a few very excited spectators
then another player throwing a ball
finally we see a batter missing his ball
we hear the umpire standing behind the catcher and heavily covered with a protection suit yelling strike
the batter who missed the ball drops his bat on the ground and comes back to the umpire
he tears the umpire helmet and mask away and gives him a good punch in the nose
the umpire falls on the ground
the catcher then hits the batter
the umpire rises slowly from the ground
several very quick sequences the ball thrower drops his glove and runs to the fight
then several excited spectators stand up to join the fight
several player who were waiting for their turn to go on the field also run to the fight
then a view of the fight where all the players are hitting each other
then the popcorn seller dropping his basket to join the fight
then spectators jumping over the balustrades to join the fight
then another view of the players fighting
then a final view of the umpire laying on the field and leaning on one elbow and quietly munching some food
we see a large view of a bridge with a white boat passing underneath
written in large white letters on the screen the words while at the same time across the river in the there was a romance in the air
close up on the sign marriage license bureau with people passing underneath
elmer here it is
i knew youd find it
boy i could sure use a drink
the camera gets down from the sign to floor level
two journalists are approaching one equipped with a camera
i wonder if any big shots are getting married today
they stop at the door of the room
larger view of the room where several people are either standing in a queue either sitting at a table and filling forms either chatting in groups of two or three
back to the two journalists still standing a the door
looks like the same suckers get married every day
he looks around for a few second then starts to move away
the photographer makes him come back
he points to someone in the room
hey the guy with the cheaters
in a line of people queueing in front of a counter we see mortimer brewster with a hat and a pair of large dark glasses
he turns around and notices the two journalists looking at him
he raises the collar of his black coat to try to hide his face
the girl in front of him turns around to look at him
she has blonde curly hair and wears a hat with a strange white feather
she is elaine harper
with both his hands mortimer turns her face back toward the counter
back to the two journalists at the door of the room
now whats he hiding from
he starts moving to get a better look at mortimer
mortimer moves in front of elaine who smiles
the two journalists are now in the room and they look at mortimer
hey isnt that mortimer brewster
mortimer brewster the dramatic critic
mortimer looks very embarrassed
back to the two journalists
no its not him
but what a scoop it would be
the guy who wrote the bachelors bible finally getting hooked himself
its too good to be true
come on lets snap the mayor in his new fire helmet and go home
hey lets stick around and see who the guy is
back to the line of people waiting in front of the counter
the marriage clerk is standing behind a set of metal bars
a couple of people leaves the counter
its now mortimer and elaines turn
the marriage clerk sings two by two they come and go
hip hip hig hay
he smiles to mortimer and elaine
good morning children
your name please
she spoke in a very soft voice
the clerk put his hand around his ear
speak a little louder
she speaks louder
mortimer comes very close to the bars above the counter and whispers
the clerk puts his hand back around his ear
the two journalists are straining their own ears to be able to understand mortimers name hows that
mortimer raises his glasses but still whispers
speak up sonny
theres nothing to be afraid of
mortimer bends down putting his chin at the counter level
then he stands up again and opens the gate in front of the clerk
he knocks his head on the bar above the gate
he straightens his hat and brings his face close to the clerks one
he still whispers
i want to keep this undercover
but of course you love her
youre going to marry her arent you
no no you dont understand
come here come
with his finger he signals the clerk to come close to him
you see i dont want this to get out for a while
im mortimer brewster
mortimer stops controlling himself and starts yelling mortimer brew
he doesnt finish telling his name takes elaines hand and runs outside the room dragging elaine behind him
the two journalists react to the news
they start running after mortimer
still dragging elaine mortimer runs in the corridor
voice over mister brewster
mortimer pushes elaine into a telephone booth and enters behind her
there is already a man in the booth who is using the phone
with three people in the booth mortimer can hardly close the door behind him
the two journalists runs in the corridor
oh mister brewster
but they pass the booth without noticing that mortimer is inside
in the booth the man still holding the phone receiver tries to protest the intrusion
mortimer takes the receiver from him and speaks into it
he hangs up the receiver and then pushes violently the man outside the booth
the man looks very angry but doesnt try to come back in the booth
in the booth a very exciter mortimer is talking to elaine
dont you understand
how can i marry you
me the symbol of bachelorhood
ive sneered at every love scene in every play
ive written four million words against marriage
not only hooked but to a ministers daughter and not only a ministers daughter but a girl from brooklyn
and look at the way you look
what is that sort of contraption youve got there
he taps on a pin on the lapel of elaines jacket
thats a pin i borrowed from your aunts
you know what theyre saying something borrowed
yeah i know that something borrowed something blue
rice and old shoes
carry you over the threshold
all that silly tripe i made fun for years
is this what ive come to
i cant go through with it
i wont marry you
and thats that
he takes his glasses off
elaine whispers yes mortimer
what do you mean yes mortimer
arent you insulted
arent you going to cry
arent you going to make a scene
and dont no mortimer me either
dont you see marriage is a superstition
its old fashioned
he kisses her very passionately
he stops kissing her and gets out of the booth dragging her behind him
they enter the marriage bureau
they get back a the end of the line of people waiting to be married
the girl in front of elaine winks to elaine
elaine winks back to her
a man in front of the girls turns toward mortimer and smiles to him in a slightly idiotic way
mortimer looks at him a bit surprised and gives him a forced smile showing his teeth
we see a street in brooklyn in front of nice house
written on the screen in large white letters and now back to one of brooklyns most charming residential districts a churchyard with a close up on a tombstone jacob john
written on the screen in large white letters from her in youre on your own
we see the gate of the churchyard with a plate that says this cemetery was established in april along this gate two cops are doing their beat
the older one sargent brophy is talking to the younger one officer patrick ohara
ohara dont be a jerk
you dont seem to realize
im turning over to you the nicest the best beat in brooklyn
now look at that old church
and them old houses
did george washington ever do any sleeping around here
of course he did
well this whole neighborhood just stinks with atmosphere
and look at that old house there
walking their beat the two cops have come outside the brewster sisters residence
are the original owners still over there
now dont crack wise about the brewster sisters
theyre two of the dearest sweetest kindest old ladies that ever walked the earth
theyre out of this world
theyre like pressed rose leaves
they have come near a police call box
brophy takes a key out of his pocket to open the box pressed rose leaves
in front of the house there is a room for rent sign
while brophy picks up the phone in the call box ohara looks at the sign
the old girls must be kind of hard up huh
their old man left them fixed for life
and dont you call them the girls either
brophy starts talking in the receiver of the call box
is lieutenant around
then so why here do they rent a room for
they dont rent rooms
but you can bet if anybody came looking for a room they wouldnt go away without a good meal and probably a couple of bucks in their pockets
thats just their way of digging up people to do good to
we get a closer view of the front of the house
a large rectangular stone with brewster engraved on it
a group of children runs in front of the house
in the forefront of the room teddy brewster is playing mozarts turkish march on the harpsichord
he looks a bit like late president theodore roosevelt
and he is dressed like the president was dressed on the official pictures weve got of him
and like the president he is wearing a pince nez
in another corner of the room abby brewster is having tea with reverend harper elaines father
she looks like an old english lady a bit like agatha christies miss marple
reverend harper i do hope you dont disapprove of mortimer just because hes a dramatic critic and takes your daughter to the theater every night
its not so much that i disapprove of his being a critic but no man no man with this published attitude on marriage
close up on the book reverend harper just took on the table marriage a fraud and a failure by mortimer brewster
should take any mans daughter anyplace
at any time
he sneezes again louder this time
teddy stops playing and there is a puzzled look in his eyes
i must be catching cold
to teddy no dear
it was reverend harper who sneezed
to reverend harper bless you
teddy puts back in his pocket the handkerchief he had taken out and starts playing again
we mustnt be angry with mortimer
hes so very much in love with her
and sister martha and i are so happy about it
he used to come to see us only occasionally and now now hes in brooklyn six nights a week
the two cops brophy and ohara are mounting the steps to the brewster sisters house
remember now watch your language
besides you know im not a swearing man
youd be surprised what theyd consider swearing
he rings the doorbell
at the sound of the doorbell teddy stops playing
oh will you excuse me
she gets up from her armchair
no no teddy dear
she goes to the door and opens it
oh come right in mr
the two cops get in
miss abby we came for the toys
ohara closes the door
this is officer ohara
hes taking over my beat
how are you doing
may i welcome you to our neighborhood mister ohara
teddy with his teacup in hand joins the group
he speaks with a very serious expression on his face
gentlemen what news have you brought me
brophy salutes him and stands at attention
colonel we have nothing to report
teddy gives an intrigued look to ohara who doesnt seem to understand
brophy elbows him with the arm which is still saluting
he eventually understands what his sargent is trying to tell him
oh no absolutely nothing to report
he salutes but with a less official attitude than his sargent
thank you gentlemen
very serious again at ease
brophy puts his arm down
ohara looks at his sargent with a perplexed expression and takes longer to put his arm down you know the reverend doctor harper from the church next door
this is officer ohara the new man on the beat
teddy looks at ohara with a puzzled expression
how do you do sir
its nice to meet you
ohara looks ill at ease under teddys stare
the toys are on the chair up here by the library door
ohara moves toward the pile of toys
teddys eyes are following him with the same puzzled expression
ohara feels less and less at ease
oh teddy will you run upstairs and bring down your army and navy from aunt marthas room
theyre all packed
thats splendid work you men do fixing up discarded toys for the kids at camp
teddy who has started to mount the stairs to the upper level stops in his stride pretends he is taking a sword out of a sheath at his side points
this imaginary sword in front of him and starts running up the stairs yelling charge
when he arrives on the balcony on which open the bedroom doors he rushes into his room and slams the door
while bophy and reverend harper remain unmoved ohara who is standing by the grandfathers clock jumps and looks at the clock which chimes once
the minute hand of the clock falls down to the half hour position
ohara is very disturbed and points his stick to his sargent who seems to be totally unmoved by the event and laughs with reverend harper and abby
it gives us something to do as we are sitting around the station
you get tired of playing cards
abby moves away from them to the grandfathers clock
she puts the minute hand back into its original position
brophy and reverend harper joins her by the clock
so these are the toys
ohara picks up the box in which the toys are stocked
hows missis brophy
oh shes better thank you
but a little weak still
well ill better get some beef broth for you to take to her
oh miss abby please dont bother
youve done so much already
oh stuff and nonsense
i wont be a minute
she moves away and exits into the kitchen
gentlemen if i know what pure kindness and absolute generosity are its because ive known the brewster sisters
on the balcony teddy gets out of his room with a bugle and starts playing it very loudly
ohara jumps and drops the box with the toys on the floor
reverend harper and brophy seem to be less moved by the event
brophy stands back and points his finger up to teddy
oh teddy you promised me you wouldnt do that anymore
teddy still standing on the balcony answers him leaning on the balustrade
but i have to call a cabinet meeting to get the release of those supplies
now dont do that again
do you hear me
teddy goes back into his room slamming the door behind him
the grandfathers clock chimes once and the minute hand falls back to the half hour position
ohara jumps and looks at the clock
he used to do that in the middle of the night and neighbors raised cain with me
theyre a little afraid of him anyway
look sarge i promised you i wouldnt swear but what the heck
he stops in the middle of his sentence gives a quick look to reverend harper and corrects himself
whats going on here anyway
oh hes quite harmless
he thinks hes teddy roosevelt
so what theres a lot of worse guys he could think he was
ohara gives a quick look toward the upper landing and then nods
ill make a note of it
hes a very interesting character
isnt it a shame father isnt it a shame reverend that a nice family like this should be hatching a cuckoo
the front door opens and martha brewster comes in
like her sister she looks like an old english lady
she is wearing a short cape and a hat and she carries a cylindrical can with a handle
she closes the door
oh well now isnt this nice
she goes to brophy and the reverend
good afternoon miss brewster
how do you do mr brophy
good afternoon miss brewster
ohara has picked up the toys and he joins the group
reverend harper how do you do
oh miss martha this is officer ohara
hes taking over my duties
how do you do maam
im very glad to know you
abby comes out of the kitchen carrying a cylindrical can similar to the one her sister is carrying thank you
abby joins the group
oh martha youre back
she gives the can to brophy
meanwhile martha has taken her cape off
heres the broth for missis brophy
be sure its good and hot
you bet i will and thank you very much
teddy is getting down the stairs carrying a box full of toys under his arm
he stops a few steps from floor level the army and navy are ready for action
he resumes his walking down the stairs
oh colonel this is grand
itll make a lot of kids happy
brophy takes the box from teddy
teddy looks into the box ohara is carrying and takes a model warship out of the box
oh teddy dear put it back
she has taken her hat off
but the oregon goes to australia
teddy tucks the model ship under his arm
ohara looks at him with puzzled eyes
no it goes to australia
these are lovely
thank you very much
not at all
brophy moves toward the front door
ohara follows him still looking at teddy
teddy doesnt seem to like the way he looks at him and moves the toy ship away from him
the children will go crazy
he has reached the front door
abby has moved near the door ready to open it for him
oh now dont mention it
ohara salutes teddy
so long colonel
teddy looks at him and then looks at brophy who doesnt salute him
ohara elbows his sargent with the arm which is saluting
brophy looks at teddy and understands the situation
he also salutes teddy
teddy salutes them
brophy and ohara bring their arms down
well goodbye and thank you
abby opens the front door
the two cops start going out brophy first
careful of the step here now with the toys
ohara goes out and then comes one step back and shows his face behind the door
he winks to teddy
teddy raises his eyebrows
young man let that be a lesson to you
ohara chuckles then makes a strange face and goes out
she closes the door and goes back to her sister and reverend harper
well i must be going
teddy still carrying his model warship starts mounting the stairs stops after a few steps takes his imaginary sword out points it forward and runs upstairs yelling charge
he reaches the balcony turns toward the balustrade and yells
charge the blockhouse
he goes into his room and slams the door behind him
we hear the grandfathers clock chiming once
reverend harper looks up at the balcony then turns to the brewster sisters with puzzled eyes
oh the stairs are always san juan hill
but reverend harper doesnt finish his sentence and sneezes very loudly
he takes his handkerchief out of his pocket to put it under his nose
have you ever tried to persuade him he wasnt teddy roosevelt
she goes to the grandfathers clock
oh hes so happy being teddy roosevelt
abby moves the minute hand of the clock back in place
oh do you remember martha
she comes back to her sister and reverend harper
once a long time ago we thought if hed be george washington it might be a change for him and we suggested it
and do you know what happened
he just stayed under his bed for days and wouldnt be anybody
reverend harper laughs
well if hes happy and whats more important youre happy
he starts walking toward the front door followed by the brewster sisters
he reaches the door and opens it
oh our only worry for teddy is after we are gone
they all go out
the three of them are coming out of the house
that is quite a problem
but mortimers made all the arrangements for teddy to go to happy dale sanitarium after we pass on
a very pleasant place
reverend harper put his hat back on his head and starts walking toward his own house
dear sweet reverend harper
the two sisters look at him
we see him cross the churchyard and enter his house
you know martha i really do believe hes beginning to see the light
they start walking back to the door of their house
im sure we neednt worry about him
he wont interfere with our plans for mortimer and elaine
the two sisters enter their house
martha closes the door
oh did you just have tea
and dinners going to be late too
they both turn their heads toward the stairs because they just heard teddys door slamming
she goes to the stairs followed by martha
teddy is coming down
oh teddy good news for you
youre going to panama and dig another lock for the canal
she points her finger toward the cellar door
martha seems delighted by the news
he rubs his hands thats bully
i shall prepare at once for the journey
he starts mounting the stairs stops and goes back a few steps down takes his imaginary sword out points it forward and runs upstairs yelling charge
before teddy slams his door abby put her hand on the face of the clock to prevent the minute hand falling down
while i was out
i just couldnt wait for you
i didnt know when youd be back and reverend harper was coming
but all by yourself
oh i got along fine
ill run right downstairs and see
she goes to the cellar door
no no dear
there wasnt time
and i was all alone
martha looks around in the room then looks at her sister with questioning eyes
martha just look in the window seat
she points to the large chest bench under the window
martha seems delighted and both sisters go to the window seat
they bend down to raise the lid of the seat when someone taps on the window above the seat
the two sisters stand up and move the curtains revealing elaines face
elaine raises the window and kisses the two sisters
she winks at them and then runs away
what did she mean
you dont suppose theyve gone and
martha puts her hand over her mouth
a taxi cab has stopped in front of the brewster sisters house
the driver is half inside the back of his car apparently looking for something
mortimer is already out of the cab
he is whistling
he raises his hand and yells elaine
elaine is crossing the churchyard to go to her fathers house
she stops and turns around to look at mortimer
on one of the tombstones is engraved the name amanda brewster and the dates
the brewster sisters who were bending out of their window to get a better view of the scene are coming back in looking extremely happy
the cab driver gives his coat to mortimer
this old cab has seen osculation but
he whistles and goes back inside the back of the car to look for other missing items
you aint seen anything yet
youve got to drive us to the station
the driver comes out of the cab holding a hat
youd better take her hat
the driver goes back inside the car
wait a minute
wait a minute
and her brooch
he gives mortimer the brooch
if you find her hairpins you can keep them
hold on to that
he gives his coat back to the driver and runs away
mortimer runs across the churchyard to meet elaine
we see the two brewster sisters peeking behind the curtains of their window
there they are
mortimer gives elaine her hat
she doesnt take it
heres your hat
just throw it
i dont like that look in your eyes
whats the matter
father preached in sermon about it only last sunday
what did he say
what did he say
elaine is trying to avoid mortimer by going around a tree
he was against it
but that was only sunday
he chases her around the tree
mortimer starts clowning
for heavens sake
but mortimer right out here in the open with everyone looking
right out here in the open with everyone looking
let everyone in brooklyn over look
he starts chasing her again
behind their curtain the two sisters are still peeking
they laugh and then slightly move the curtains open a few inches to have a better look
back to the tree
the couple is hidden by the tree
they separate and move a little away from each other each one of them appearing on either side the tree
elaine drags mortimer by the hand from behind the tree
but mortimer youre going to love me for my mind too
one thing at a time
she starts running away from him
theres that look again
mortimer comes slowly from behind the tree clowning
theres that look again mortimer
you better get used to it
he becomes more serious and come closer to her
look like youre going to see it often
it goes just before this
he kisses her very passionately
you know what were doing darling
were wasting time
look ill go tell my aunts and you tell your old
no youd better not tell your father just yet
youll run that cold of his into a pneumonia
oh i can handle father
hes a dear
look why dont we wire him from niagara falls
then thats why you stopped at your office
were going to go the whole hog
everybody ought to go to niagara falls
you shouldve seen my secretarys face when i made the reservation
weve got a drawing room on the train the bridal suite in the hotel and tomorrow morning we go over the falls in a barrel
elaine kisses mortimer very passionately
go on darling hurry and pack
i dont have to
i started packing the day after i met you
she starts moving away
he holds her back
there you see
thats what i mean
thats what i hate about women
mortimer kisses her
back to the cab driver who is pacing in front of his car
he rubs his chin
i wonder what marys doing now
mortimer and elaine are still kissing
mortimer lets go of elaine
he puts her hat on her head
go on darling the train leaves in an hour and hurry
itll be a few minutes before im ready
father may want to pray over me a little
she moves away
whistle when youre ready
she turns around
when you whistle open the front door fast
if you see a tall dark streak of light its me
he starts running toward his aunts house
elaine runs to her fathers house
she stops at the door of her house and starts whistling
mortimer who had also reached his door stops and turns around
he starts running toward her but she stops him
no not now
she opens her door
the two sisters are eagerly waiting for mortimer
look surprised when he tells us
they hear a door slamming in the next room
voice over aunt abby aunt martha
mortimer rushes into the room and throws his hat on a chair
hold on to your bustles
elaine and i are married
the two sisters hug and kiss mortimer
oh darling how wonderful
oh martha isnt it wonderful
dont pretend to be so surprised either you two old frauds
can i use the telephone darling
yes of course
mortimer goes to the telephone followed by his two aunts
isnt it too too wonderful
mortimer sits at the small desk on which the telephone is and whistles while dialing
and to think that it happened right here in this room
she dabs her nose with her handkerchief
oh now here here now
this is mortimer brewster
did you send those roses to missis brewsters apartment
now send four dozen more to drawing room a canadian limited grand central station
and hurry then
and throw in a flock of orange blossoms
he puts the telephone receiver back on his hook and he turns on his chair to face his aunts his arms resting on the back of the chair
but before you go we can have our celebration
ill open a bottle of wine and well sing
and well invite a few of the neighbors in
and of course a wedding cake
oh darling you wont have time to bake a cake
were going to niagara falls
ive got a taxi waiting
oh its all ready
its been ready since
yeah i bet its been ready since the first day i met her huh
he stands up
what is it
did everybody in brooklyn know i was getting married except me
oh we knew youd find out about it in time
mortimer laughs and hugs his aunts
ive got the two nicest aunts in the world
of course youve got the nicest nephew in the world too
martha moves away to the kitchen
well ill run along and get everything ready
i do hope the reverend isnt too angry
you know how your books upset him
well im going to burn all my books
and ill let the reverend harper light the first match
oh by the way did i leave some notes here for my new book
you mean mind over matrimony
where are they
i hid them someplace
abby turns to go searching and mortimer pats her behind
come on come on
abby turns back to him
now you behave
she goes away on her search
lets find them before elaine sees them
teddy comes out of his room on the balcony
he is dressed in full colonial costume complete with pith helmet
he is carrying a shovel and his bugle is stuck in his belt
he walks rapidly down the stairs
he stops a few steps from the ground floor when he spots mortimer
he seems very happy to see him
they shake hands
how are you mister president
bully thank you
what news have you brought me
teddy takes off his pince nez
just this mister president
the countrys squarely behind you
yes i know
isnt it wonderful
he puts his pince nez back on his nose and shakes hands again with mortimer
im off to panama
teddy walks to the cellar door
mortimer bends slightly
goodbye mister president
before he opens the door teddy turns to mortimer
a new lock for the canal you know
he opens the door and starts walking down the steps to the cellar
before the door closes back we can hear him singing oh tell the news to mother
abby is still looking for mortimers note and in a drawer she finds a piece of paper that seems to annoy her
did you find those notes
mortimer senses there is something wrong in his aunts voice and walks to her
whats the matter
she holds the paper for mortimer to take it
theres a baby picture of your brother jonathan
mortimer takes the picture and looks at it
insert close up of the picture
it shows a very ugly child with a very strange face
you ought to put that in the fire with my books
my what a face
he gives the picture back to abby
i remember now
he used to scare grownups with it
mortimer walks away from his aunt
just the thought of jonathan frightens me
do you remember how he used to cut worms in two with his teeth
mortimer is searching on the small telephone desk
oh hes probably in prison or hanged or something by now
he walks across the room and starts searching on the table
i saw a play which had a character in it
reminded me of jonathan
while talking they both keep on searching everywhere in the room
oh a honey of a lunatic
one of those whodunits called murder will out
abby goes into the kitchen
yeah what a play
when the curtain goes up the first thing you see is a dead body
while talking he keeps on searching and opens the lid of the window seat
he gives its insides a quick look and closes it back and then moves away
the next thing
he stops in his tracks and looks back at the window seat
he jumps back to it opens the lid and closes it very quickly
he then sits on the seat with a frightened look on his face
slowly he kneels down on the floor and opens the lid again but very slowly
he talks to whatever or whomever is in the seat
he remains a few seconds seated of the seat with a very puzzled face
we hear elaine whistling
mortimer tries to whistle back but no sound comes from his mouth
he tries again but with no more success
he seems in shock
he looks at the kitchen then at the seat
there is horror on his face
his two aunts come from the kitchen singing and carrying things for the celebration
mortimer shows a forced smile
the two sisters puts things on the table then they come to mortimer who is still seated on the window seat
abby is carrying a big bowl of rice and the two girls start throwing rice on him
never mind that now
mortimer takes the bowl from abbys hands and put it on a small table
he remains seated while his aunts are standing in front of him
now listen darlings
aunt abby aunt martha you know how weve always planned to send teddy to that sanitarium happy dale
oh yes dear
thats after were gone
they move away to start setting the table
yes we talked with reverend harper about it
teddys got to go to happy dale now
now hes down in the cellar
get him up here right away
but theres no such hurry as yet you know
when teddys working on the canal you cant get his mind on anything else
mortimer stands up and comes to the table where his aunts are working
well look darlings
look im frightfully sorry but ive got an awful shock for you
he takes abbys hands in his
teddys killed a man darlings
he yells but theres a body in the window seat
mortimer looks even more shocked than before
his two aunts keep on setting the table as if nothing had happened
yes but it has nothing to do with teddy
mortimer wants to speak but abby stops him
you just forget about it
forget you ever saw the gentleman
we never dreamed youd peek
who is he
hes a mister hoskins
thats really all i know about him except that hes a methodist
hes a methodist
isnt that nice
thats all you know
but whats he doing here
what happened to him
mortimer is more and more shocked and his aunts very calmly keep on putting plates and silverware on the table
look aunt martha men just dont get into window seats and die
he died first
mortimer takes his aunts hands to stop them from setting the table
oh well now wait
stop all this
he takes abbys hands in his
now look darlings how did he die
oh mortimer dont be so inquisitive
the gentleman died because he drank some wine with poison in it
but how did the poison get in the wine
well we put it in wine because its less noticeable
when its in tea it has a distinct odor
you mean you
yelling you put it in the wine
and i put mister hoskins in the window seat because reverend harper was coming
mortimer seems ready to faint
look at me darling
he takes again abbys hands in his
you mean you mean you knew what youd done and you didnt want the reverend harper to see the body
well not at tea
that wouldnt have been very nice
abby goes back table setting and mortimer holds himself on the edge of the table
its first degree
now mortimer you know all about it and just forget about it
i do think that martha and i have the right to our own little secrets
martha walks to the kitchen door but she stops and turns around
oh abby while i was out i dropped in on missis schultz
shes much better
but she wants us to take junior to the movies again
well we must do that tomorrow or next day
yes but this time well go where we want to go
juniors not going to drag me into another one of those scary pictures
the two sisters enter the kitchen
no they ought not to be allowed to make those pictures just to frighten people
mortimer remains alone in the room
he has the face of someone who thinks he is having a nightmare and hopes to wake up soon
he goes to the telephone desk picks up the phone and dials
can you hear my voice
are you sure
he puts the phone down
then i must be here
elaine is appearing of her room in her fathers house
she has got her purse and her gloves
she plays with a large artificial flower
mortimer half seated on the telephone desk comes out of his dream and goes to the window
by signs only he tries to explain to elaine that hes got a problem with the window seat
we dont see her but we imagine she doesnt understand because mortimer rushes to the kitchen
mortimer rushes into the kitchen
he stops abruptly
a group of costumed and masked children are gathered behind the window
martha is distributing watermelons pumpkins and pies to them
the children are saying incomprehensible words of thanking
martha closes the window on them and switches on the lights
oh the dears
isnt halloween a wonderful time for them
yes it is
they have so much fun
they both go back to their cooking work in the kitchen
martha is preparing some kind of desert in a bowl
now mortimer dont be so impatient
well let you lick the bowl out
lick the bowl
i dont want to lick the bowl
i want to know what were going to do
well were going to celebrate dear
theres a body in the window seat
oh i know what his name is
i just want to know what were going to do
we cant turn you over to the police
mortimer paces the kitchen while his aunts are busy cooking
you just should get stop worrying about it
we told you to forget the whole thing
look my dear aunt martha cant i make you realize that something has to be done
abby leaves the stove where she was working and comes to the table
now mortimer you behave
youre too old to be flying off the handle like this
but but mister hodgekiss
but whatever his name is you cant leave him in there
we dont intend to dear
no teddys down in the cellar now digging the lock
mortimer looks very shocked
oh you mean youre going to bury mister hodgekiss in the cellar
oh yes dear
thats what we did with the others
look here aunt martha
he comes close to the table where martha is working
and all of a sudden he seems to realize what she just said
the other gentlemen
when you say others do you mean others
more than one others
oh yes dear
let me see now
this is eleven isnt it abby
oh no dear
this makes twelve
abby dear i think youre wrong
this one is only eleven
no dear because i remember when mister hoskins first came in it occurred to me that hed make just an even dozen
mortimer seems completely dejected and he sits down not even listening to his aunts anymore
but look abby dear i really dont think you should count the first one
oh i was counting the first one and that makes it twelve
abby who is sucking her finger nods to answer
well shes probably right
abby usually is
i get them mixed up sometimes
makes it twelve
the telephone rings
mortimer puts his hand to his ear
he suddenly realizes that he doesnt have a telephone in his hand
he rushes out of the kitchen
well whatever is the matter with mortimer today
why abby what do you think happened to him
they walk out of the kitchen
mortimer sits at the telephone desk and picks up the phone
we hear some whistling coming from the telephone
mortimer takes the receiver a bit away from his ear surprised
then he takes it back
for heavens sake keep your shirt on
he slams the phone down on his hook
then he realizes he has been rude and picks it up again
oh elaine i didnt mean
he realizes there is no one on the phone and puts it back down
now lets see
where were we
he yells twelve
he jumps from his chair and rushes toward the kitchen
but when he sees his two aunts setting the table he stops and goes to them
abby thinks we should count the first one
never mind about that
just sit down
martha sits down
now tell me who was the first one
he was a baptist
he was such a lonely old gentleman mister midgely was
all his kith and kin were dead
we felt so sorry for him
and then when his heart attack came and he sat there dead in that chair looking so peaceful
we made up our minds then and there that if we could help other lonely old men to find that same peace we would
why you poor
you mean he dropped dead right in this chair
mortimer realizes its the chair hes sitting on and stands up very quickly
and then you see teddy came up from digging in panama and he thought mister midgely was a yellow fever victim
and that meant he had to be buried immediately
so we all took him down to panama and put him in the lock and gave him a decent christian burial
there now you see
she stands up thats why we told you not to bother about it because we know exactly whats to be done
mortimer is sitting on the table and seems not to know what he must do next
but he suddenly stands up
wait a minute
he rushes to his aunts
come here darlings
what about the others
all twelve of them didnt walk in here and drop dead
oh no dear
of course not
well so so
abby whispers something in marthas ear
martha looks at mortimer smiles and whispers back in her sisters ear
do you remember those jars of poison that were on the shelves in grandfathers laboratory all these years
you know your aunt marthas knack for mixing things
youve eaten enough of her piccalilli
well dear for a gallon of elderberry wine i take one teaspoonful of arsenic then add half a teaspoonful of strychnine
and then just a pinch of cyanide
should have quite a kick
yes as a matter of fact one of our gentlemen found time to say how delicious
well wasnt that nice of him
abby we mustnt be standing here gossiping all night
well we must get that cake frosted
she moves toward the kitchen followed by abby
oh no darling dont worry about the cake
i couldnt eat a thing
oh you newlyweds
a sip of wine will give you an appetite
thatd be nice darling a sip of
a sip of wine
he stands up
he wants to move away but his foot get entangled in the back of a chair and he almost falls down
elaine appears at the window of her room
she is arranging the artificial flower on the lapel of her jacket
she moves away from the window
the cab driver is still pacing on the sidewalk near his car
mortimer closes the drapes between the sitting room and the next room
he then goes to the cellar door and opens the door ajar
a cat meows and comes out through the opening
we hear teddy singing down in the cellar
im beginning to think the cats in on this
he listens to the singing coming from the cellar
happy as a lark
singing away digging locks
he closes the cellar door
got him working on a yellow fever victim
oh i can see the headlines now murder incorporator rides again right across the front page
let me see
everybody knows hes crazy
let me see
who can i call up
dewey la guardia winchell
no winchells no good
old judge cullman
he starts moving across the room putting his hand in the inside breast pocket of his jacket
i wonder if i got his number
he gets a couple of tickets out of his pocket
he sits at the small telephone desk
what am i doing with tickets
he throws the tickets on the desk
he picks up the phone and starts dialing
get me the number of judge cullman on north shore road brooklyn
yeah would you call me back
the night has come
elaine is walking very rapidly on the sidewalk
she passes near the taxi
the driver opens the door for her but she keeps on walking
mortimer is standing by the window seat
all the drapes are closed
he bends down
how it would be marvelous if he wasnt there
he slowly opens the lid of the seat
when the lid is a few inches open he peeks inside
voice over hey you
when he hears elaines voice mortimer slams the lid down and sit on the seat
thought you were tall dark streak of light
she is standing by the half open door and she makes the gestures mortimer made when he had told her the same sentence earlier in the churchyard
what are you doing here
what am i doing here
didnt you hear me whistle
oh yes yes
i heard you whistle
he stands up and comes to her in the middle of the room
he gives her a quick kiss
hey how do i look
she pivots to show him the way she is dressed
oh you look fine you look fine
now run on home
ill call you up tomorrow
he pushes her toward the door
yeah you know i always call you up every day or two

huh huh huh
she is pulling him toward the door
yeah come on
oh elaine im so sorry
but somethings happened

hey wheres that look i was going to see so often
she takes his head to bring her mouth close to his ear and then she starts whistling
he moves away and rubs his ear
dont whistle in my ear please
mortimer what is wrong
look at your hair
he bends down for her to see his hair better
oh my god what color is it
has it turned
oh darling whats the matter
she starts stroking his face
he bends down on her shoulder
oh elaine if i could only tell you elaine
you smell so nice
the phone rings
mortimer jumps up oh
he pushes her out through the open door
you better go home
but darling we were married today
all right go home go to bed get some rest
he slams the door on her and rushes to the telephone
he sits down at the desk and picks up the phone
the front door opens and elaine comes back inside the house
this is mortimer brewster
look judge ill tell you why i called you
its about teddy
elaine crosses the room and sits on the window seat
ive got to come over and see you right away
oh im afraid it wont wait until tomorrow judge
yeah you see its very very important
weve got to do something about it immediately
but its practically a matter of life and
mortimer turns his head and sees elaine sitting on the window seat
he drops the phone on the desk and yells elaine
elaine frightened jumps up from the seat
mortimer rushes to her
will you get out of here
mortimer what in the world is going on around here
i dont even know where i stand
anywhere but dont stand there
he moves her away from the window seat
but darling niagara falls
if it does well let it
now wait a minute
you cant marry me one minute and then throw me out the house the next
oh darling im not throwing you out of the house
he lifts her and actually throws her out of the house will you get out of here
elaine bumps into an old man mr
gibbs standing just outside the entrance of the house
he is holding a newspaper in his hand
she comes back to the door but mortimer slams it in her face
mortimer locks the door and goes back to the phone elaine is knocking desperately on the door
gibbs is still behind her
mortimer is back sitting at the desk and talking into the phone
in the background we hear elaines pounding on the door
im sorry judge
a thing happened
but judge about teddy you see
voice over mortimer
you see judge its his bugle blowing
yes the neighbors have been complaining and the police are all set to throw him into a state institution
elaine seems quite angry
how do you like that
gibbs shows his newspaper to elaine i read an ad here about a room to rent
she walks away leaving gibbs at the door
she walks quickly by the taxi
the driver opens the door for her but she walks on with quick steps
mortimer is still on the phone
well i thought that if you sign the papers i can get teddy to commit himself and get him in happy dale
yes its a wonderful place judge
ill be over right as soon as ive made another call
the front door bell rings
gibbs is standing by the door ringing the bell
abby comes in the room from the kitchen
mortimer is still on the phone
doorbells ringing dear
she crosses the room to the front door
she opens the door revealing gibbs
oh how do you do
the kitchen door has remained open and we see martha still working on her cooking
voice over i understand youve got a room to rent

mortimer is standing with the telephone set in one hand and the receiver on his ear in the other hand
i can see the headlines now
back to normal voice hello

he stands up and takes his hat which he had put on the table
the rooms upstairs
abby is seated at the table with martha standing behind her
she takes the carafe
wont you try a glass of our wine before we start up
never touch it
well we make this ourselves

he puts his hat back on the table and sits down
i havent tasted elderberry wine since i was a boy

abby starts pouring the wine in the glass
voice over operator
well i dont want the happy dale laundry

yes like a broken record
gibbs takes the glass from abby

gibbs raises his glass
in the background mortimer is yelling louder and louder
gibbs who had the glass almost to his lips puts it down
the two sisters watch him with expecting eyes
voice over hello operator
no operator whats taking you so long
its only across the river
i could swim it faster
gibbs who had taken the glass back to his lips put it down once more
voice over what

theyre busy and youre dizzy
no im not drunk madam but youve given me an idea
a noise of chairs and various objects falling
mortimer comes to the table and takes the carafe and a glass
abby concentrated on gibbs raising the glass to his lips again doesnt see him but martha does and seems very anxious about it
she taps her two forefingers together
ah ah ah ah
mortimer keeps on pouring the wine in the glass darling dont ah ah ah ah im nervous

abby sees him
she turns around and very calmly holds the hand which is holding the glass
he puts the glass down and suddenly realizes the situation
he looks at gibbs who has taken the glass to his lips
he yells and gibbs frightened stands up and drops the glass on the floor
mortimer points his finger at him
get out of here
do you want to be poisoned do you want to be murdered do you want to be killed
gibbs grabs his hat and runs to the front door
mortimer runs after him and falls over an armchair standing in his way
the two sisters seem very upset
gibbs gets out and slams the door
gibbs runs out of the house and stops by the cab driver who is seated near his taxi smoking a cigarette
hey youre telling me
gibbs runs away in the street
the two sisters are seated on the window seat
mortimer slowly raises himself from the overturned armchair
look you cant do things like that
he stands up and puts the armchair back on its legs
now i dont know how i can explain this to you but its not only against the law its wrong
he walks slowly toward them
both sisters are sulking
its not a nice thing to do
people wouldnt understand
he points to the front door and the departed mr
he wouldnt understand
what i mean is
this is developing into a very bad habit
the telephone rings
he goes to the desk sits on the chair and picks up the phone
oh happy dale sanitarium

abby and martha nod
he puts the hat on his head
the hat is ostensibly to large for him
he opens the front door voice over mortimer
he was almost out but he turns around
abby points to the hat but cant talk
uh uh uh uh
stop that uh uh uh
what is it
mortimer raises his eyes and tears the had off his head ohhhh
he throws the hat away leaves and closes the door
the cab driver is pacing back and forth on the sidewalk near his taxi
mortimer comes running out of the house
the driver goes toward him
do you still want me to wait here
call me a cab
they run together and stop in front of the parked taxi
the driver waves his arm
here you are
another taxi stops near the first one
the driver wants to open the back door for mortimer
dont open it
ill sit with you
yeah thats right
i can go faster that way
mortimer climbs in the front of the taxi next to the driver
the taxi drives away and the first driver remains on the street touching his cap
wait a minute
what am i doing
he pats his own taxi points his finger to it and waves for the other taxi to come back
abby picks up mr
she brushes it with her hand and gives it to martha
fancy getting nice mr
hoskins hat all mussed up
such a nice hat
she crosses the room and takes a brush on a cupboard near the window seat and starts brushing the hat
you know abby mortimer didnt seem to be quite himself today
abby brings two candlesticks on the table no
martha opens the cupboard which is full of mans hats
she puts hoskins hat with the others and then closes the cupboard well what were you saying about mortimer
abby has lit the candles
oh i think i understand why he seemed so upset
hes just been married
i believe that always makes a man a little nervous
the poor dears
she crosses the room to the door to switch off the lights im so happy for elaine
if mortimers coming back for the services for mr
hoskins were going to need another hymnal
theres one up in my room
knocks at the front door
through the frosted window panels of the door we see the shadows of two men
oh ill go dear
abby we promised mortimer we wouldnt let anyone come in
more knocks at the door
martha peeks through the drapes of a convenient window a few steps above floor level on the staircase
two men and ive never seen them before
are you sure
let me look
abby climbs the steps and comes near her sister to peek through the drapes you look
the two shadows knock again
do you recognize them
no theyre strangers to me
well well just have to pretend were not at home
the front door opens
the tallest of the two men dressed in black and wearing a large hat comes in first
the other one shorter and hatless follows him
we get a close up of the face of the tall man actually jonathan brewster
its full of scars and it makes him look a bit like boris karloff in the frankenstein films
he looks around the room
come in doctor
doctor einstein who was waiting at the door comes into the room and closes the door behind him
this is the home of my youth
as a boy i couldnt wait to escape from this house
now im glad to escape back into it
yes johnny its a good hideout
he takes a small bottle from an inside pocket of his jacket and takes a sip at it
the family must still live here
i hope theres a fatted calf awaiting the return of the prodigal
a fatted calf
oh johnny im so hungry
he comes closer to the table
as if we were expected
a good omen
einstein pours some wine from the carafe in a glass
jonathan takes a glass already full on the table
abby gets down the few steps followed by martha
who are you
what are you doing here
the two men put their glasses down on the table aunt abby
you you get out of here
im jonathan you know
your nephew jonathan
he takes his hat off
oh no youre not
youre nothing like jonathan so dont pretend you are
you just get out of here
she points to the door
i see youre still wearing the lovely garnet ring that grandma brewster bought in england
and you aunt martha still the high collar to hide the scar where grandfathers acid burned you
why his voice is like jonathans
have have you been in an accident
doctor einstein is responsible for that
hes a plastic surgeon
but ive seen that face before
do you remember when we took the little schultz boy to the movies and i was so frightened
it was that face
jonathan turns around and look harshly at einstein who seems a bit uneasy
take it easy johnny
take it easy
the last five years i give him three different faces
i give him another one right away
that last face
i saw that picture too just before i operated
i was intoxicated
jonathan grabs einsteins collar and squeezes it
you see doctor what youve done to me
even my own family think im
einstein has breathing problems because of jonathans squeezing
you are home in this lovely house
jonathan lets go of einstein who walks toward the two sisters
you know how many times he tells me about
about brooklyn about this house and about his aunts he loves so much
they know you johnny
please tell him so
well jonathan its been a long time
jonathan sits down
its good to be home again
abby turns toward martha and then goes down the few last steps to floor level
well martha we mustnt let whats on the stove boil over
she picks up the glasses on the table
if youll excuse us for a moment jonathan
unless youre in a hurry to go somewhere
she goes to the kitchen with the glasses
martha picks up the wine carafe to the disappointment of dr
einstein and follows her sister toward the kitchen
before entering the kitchen she puts the carafe back on the shelf where it was before
she then closes the kitchen door after her
well johnny where do we go from here
you know johnny we got to think fast
close up on the hands of jonathan playing with a metallic brain teaser
the police they got pictures of that face
i got to operate on you right away
we got to find someplace
we got to find someplace for mister spenalzo too
while talking he has taken another sip from his bottle
dont waste any worry on that rat
einstein stands up
but we got a hot stiff on our hands
but johnny we cant leave a dead body in the rumble seat
you shouldnt have killed him
just because he knows something about us what happens
einstein mimes the breaking of a neck with his hands
we come to him for help and he tries to shake us down
besides he said i looked like boris karloff
thats your work doctor
you did that to me
no please johnny take it easy
well find some place and ill fix you up right away
yes tonight but i have to eat first
the two sisters are peeking in the room through a small rectangular hole in the door of the kitchen
this time i want the face of an absolute nonentity
i know exactly what im going to do
he comes close to jonathan and shows him on his face what he is going to do to it
you see im going to take this piece here and lift it up
be careful about the stitches this time
you leave that up to me
ill give you nice little ears and
you were careless last time
and new stitches
and on the eyes ill do a schmidt
thats my specialty
you see i take it together like this
leave the eyes alone
leave the nose alone
the scene dissolves to the judge is sitting studying some papers
mortimer is standing at his side
i imagine its for the best
he drops the papers on the desk and starts declaiming
ours not to reason why ours but to do
mortimer is very irritated by the judges erratic attitude
he puts a pen in his hand
sign right here please judge
sometimes i think with the world in its present chaotic state
mortimer takes the pen from the judges hand and starts signing the papers
yes i know wed all be better off at happy dale
i sign here as next of kin dont i
only last week i created a mild sensation at the bar association when i said
mortimer dries the document and shakes the judges hand
good luck judge
he walks to the door of the office
tell martha and abby ill be over this week
ive been feeling rather lonely
mortimer comes back on his steps
never tell them youve been lonely
mortimer comes back to the judges desk
tell me are you a drinking man
i never indulge
then youll live longer
he goes back to the door
of course a little wine now
for heavens sake no wine
he goes out slamming the door behind him
the judge looks pensively at the door mortimer just closed
i may be committing the wrong brewster
the scene dissolves to the brewster sister are sitting at the table with doctor einstein and jonathan
the dinner is finished and both men are smoking
well im sure you both want to get to wherever youre going
the two sisters stands up from the table
my dear sweet aunties im so full of your delicious dinner im unable to move a muscle
yes its nice here
teddy comes out of his room on the balcony
he is still wearing his colonial costume
he has a book in his hand and a spare pith helmet under his arm
he rushes down the stairs
i found it
i found it
he stops suddenly in the staircase
gentlemen be seated
jonathan and einstein pretend they are standing up but they immediately sit back in their chairs
teddy comes down the last steps and goes toward the table
here it is gentlemen
the story of my life my biography
he puts the book on the table in front of einstein
its open on a page with a picture
heres the picture i was telling you about general
here we are both of us
president roosevelt and general goethals at culebra cut
thats me general and thats you
einstein looks at the picture
my how ive changed
well you see that picture hasnt been taken yet
we havent even started work on culebra cut
were still digging locks
and now general we will both go to panama and inspect the new lock
he gives the spare helmet to einstein
not to panama
oh maybe some other time mister president
panama is a long ways off
its just down in the cellar
jonathan who hadnt seemed to be much interested by teddys conversation suddenly looks up
well we let him dig the panama canal in the cellar
einstein slightly raises the hand holding the cigarette to his forehead
as president of the united states commander in chief of the army and navy and the man who gave you this job i demand that you accompany me on the
inspection of the new lock
i think its time for you to go to bed
i beg your pardon
who are you
im woodrow wilson
go to bed
no youre not wilson
but your face is familiar
let me see
youre not anyone i know now
perhaps later on my hunting trip to africa
yes you look like someone i might meet in the jungle
jonathan starts standing up with a very menacing face
i think perhaps you had better go to bed teddy
he and his friend want to get back to their hotel
jonathan sits back in his chair
general goethals inspect the canal
einstein stands up and takes his helmet
all right mister president we go to panama
follow me general
he opens the door to the cellar then turns toward einstein taps on the helmet einstein is carrying and then on his own helmet
its down south you know
einstein puts the helmet on his head
the helmet is too large for him and gets down on his eyes
teddy starts going downstairs
before following him einstein turns around to the others
well bon voyage
he waves them goodbye and then follows teddy downstairs
jonathan has remained seated with both his aunts standing on the other side of the table
aunt abby i must correct your misapprehension
you talked of our hotel
we have no hotel
we came here directly
this is not your home and im afraid you cant stay here
jonathan stands up and looks menacingly at his aunts
while talking he moves closer to them
they look frightened
doctor einstein and i need a place to sleep
you remember that as a boy i could be disagreeable
it would not be pleasant for any of us if
but i dont have to go into details do i
perhaps wed better let them stay here tonight
einstein appears at the door of the cellar
hey johnny johnny
he goes back down the stairs to the cellar
oh i forgot to tell you doctor einstein and i are turning grandfathers laboratory into an operating room
we expect to be very busy
he goes to the cellar door
einstein is on the staircase halfway down to the cellar
on the wall behind him we see the shadow of teddy digging
hey johnny down here what do you think i find
he takes off his helmet
jonathan joins him on the stairs
the panama canal
and it just fits mister spenalzo
see the hole hes digging
four feet wide six feet long
he just fits
youd think he knew we were bringing mister spenalzo along
jonathan smiles and looks upstairs
rather a good joke on my aunts
theyre living in a house with a body buried in the cellar
hey how do we get him in here
yes we cant just walk mister spenalzo in through the door
well bring the car up between the cemetery and the house and after theyve gone to bed well bring mister spenalzo in through the window
he goes back up the stairs
einstein follows him
the shadow of teddy keeps on digging
jonathan comes in through the cellar door with einstein following behind him
his two aunts are still standing up in the room
were moving the car behind the house
youd better get to bed
he crosses the room with einstein following him
the car is all right where it is until morning
i dont want to leave it in the street
that might be against the law
he opens the front door and gets out still followed by einstein
what are we going to do
well were not going to let them spend more than one night in this house for one thing
but what would the neighbors think
people coming in here with one face and going out with another
and what are we going to do about mister hoskins
it cant be very comfortable for him in there
and hes been so patient the poor dear
well i think teddy had better take mister hoskins downstairs right away
teddy enters by the cellar door
general goethals was very pleased
he said the canal was just the right size
from the table he picks up the book he had shown to dr
einstein and starts looking at it
teddy theres been another yellow fever victim
this will be a shock to the general
no teddy we must keep it a secret
a state secret
yes a state secret
you have the word of the president of the united states
cross my heart and hope to die
he crosses his chest and spits on the floor
then he takes his aunts in his arms
now lets see
how are we going to keep it a secret
well teddy i think youd better get back down into the cellar
and then when i turn out the lights when everythings dark here you come up and take the poor man down to the canal
now get along teddy
teddy crosses the room to the cellar door
and well come down later and hold services
teddy opens the door and turns around
where is the poor devil
voice over in the window seat
it seems to be spreading
weve never had yellow fever there before
ive never even seen mister hoskins
oh my goodness
thats right you were out
well you just come right along and see him now
you know hes really very nice looking considering that hes a methodist
both sisters go to the window seat and are ready to lift the lid when the drapes above the seat suddenly open wide revealing a very menacing jonathan
the two sisters back off frightened
jonathan slowly climbs in through the window and stands up on the window seat
were bringing the luggage through here
he gets down from the window seat
then einstein appears behind the window carrying a suitcase
jonathan helps him to bring the suitcase in the room
jonathan your room is waiting for you
you can go right up
einstein still outside the window gives jonathan another suitcase
im afraid we dont keep brooklyn hours
you two run along to bed
oh but you must be very tired
both of you
and we dont go to bed this early
its time i came home to take care of you
behind jonathan einstein has come into the room and is closing the window and then the drapes
to einstein take the bags upstairs
einstein takes the two suitcases and starts moving away
for the instruments ill come back later
einstein slightly bows to abby
now well all go to bed
ill wait until youre up and then turn out the lights
einstein has already almost reached the balcony
martha starts climbing with jonathan behind her
run along aunt martha
just off the laboratory doctor
everybody reaches the balcony
einstein disappears at the end of the balcony and martha enters her room
jonathan turns around and looks down at abby
all right aunt abby
ill be right up
now aunt abby
turn out the lights
abby goes to the switch near the front door and switches the lights off
the room is completely dark
abby climbs the stairs reaches the balcony and walks slowly pass jonathan who is still standing at the same place
then she quickly enters the room she shares with her sister who is holding the door open for her
jonathan moves along the balcony and starts climbing the stairs to the upper floor
he stops after a few steps and sees the door of his aunts room opening slowly
abby comes out
abby quickly goes back into the room and closes the door
jonathan resumes his climbing
the camera moves down into total black darkness and then into the room where we see some light underneath the cellar door
we hear steps and the door opens to reveal teddy still in his colonial costume but without the helmet
he stops a few seconds then starts crossing the room only lit by light coming from underneath the kitchen door
we hear the lid of the window seat creaking and we guess teddy has just opened it
then we see the shadow of teddy carrying something apparently heavy
we hear the cat screaming and we guess teddy must have stepped on its tail
when teddy comes into the light from the open door of the cellar we discover he is carrying a human body which could only be mr
hoskins one taken from the window seat
teddy turns around and starts going backward down the steps to the cellar
he stops a few seconds to close the door
then we hear noises of something falling and we guess that teddy must have missed a step and fallen all the way down to the cellar
black screen during one second
einstein is going down the staircase lit only by a match he is holding in his hand
hes all right johnny
when he gets on floor level he meets jonathan
ill open the window
you go round and hand him through
but hes too heavy for me
he burns his finger and blows the match
the scene becomes completely dark
we see only shadows
you go outside johnny and push and ill stay here and pull
and then together we take him down to panama
we must be quick
ill take a look around outside the house
when i tap on the glass you open the window
jonathan moves to the front door opens it stops to look around and then closes the door
einstein walks slowly in the room
its dark in here
he bumps into something
we hear the lid of the window seat creaking several times
einstein light another match and we discover he has fallen into the open window seat where he is now lying where am i
oh here i am
he slowly gets out of the seat
who left this open
jonathan taps on the window
einstein blows the match and opens the window
we see only shadows in the dark but we guess jonathan is handing mr
spenalzos corpse to einstein who will then put it in the window seat
okay johnny wait a minute
hand him over
now i have him
now wait a minute johnny
you lost a leg somewhere
hey help me
hes so heavy

now i got him
oh but his shoe came off
help me johnny
hes so heavy
now ive got him
knocking at the door
hey johnny somebodys at the door
go open quick
ill manage spenalzo
some more knocking
we hear the creaking of the lid of the window seat and we guess einstein is closing it
the front door opens slowly and elaine enters the house
we see the frightened face of einstein
voice over aunt martha
jonathan enters through the front door left open by elaine closes it and locks it
looking frightened who is it
is that you teddy
who are you
im elaine harper
i live next door
what are you doing here
i came here to see my husband mortimer
why did you say your name was harper
well it is harper
i mean its brewster
im not very used to it
im a brand new brewster
einstein goes to the front door and switches the lights on
its all right johnny
einstein has his little bottle in one hand and with the finger of the other hand he tries to explain to jonathan that the corpse is safely in the window
jonathan looks at einstein and then goes across the room to look around
he even moves the drapes of a window to look outside
voice over maybe youd better explain what youre doing here
jonathan keeps on checking around
he goes to the window above the window seat and looks outside
we happen to live here
he spots an orphan shoe on the floor and picks it up
voice over you dont live here
ive been in this house every day and ive never seen you before
where are miss martha and miss abby
what have you done to them
einstein tries to explain to jonathan without using words that the shoe belongs to the corpse in the window seat
perhaps wed better introduce ourselves
may i present doctor einstein
he puts the shoe on the table then lifts the tablecloth to look underneath it
a surgeon of great distinction
and something of a magician
now i suppose youre gonna tell me that youre boris
cutting her very harshly i am jonathan brewster
jonathan comes close to her and looks at her in such a strange way that she starts walking backward
youve heard of me
yes they talk about you
what do they say about me
elaine stops walking backward
oh just that theres another brother named jonathan thats all they say
oh that explains everything
now that i know who you are ill just be running along if youll kindly unlock the door
they move to the front door beside which einstein is standing smiling
jonathan unlocks the door
he opens it a few inches but stands in the way of elaine ready to got out
that explains everything
just what do you mean by that
why do you come here at this time of night
well i just thought i saw mortimer drive up
i suppose it was you
jonathan slams the door and locks it
you thought you saw someone drive up
he walks menacingly toward her and she starts walking backward across the room
werent you just outside
isnt that your car
you saw someone at the car
einstein starts walking behind jonathan
what else did you see
oh just that thats all
is that why you came over here
oh no i came to see mortimer
but if hes not home ill run
she tries to run away but jonathan grabs her arms and holds it very firmly
youve given two names
youre hurting me
i think shes dangerous
teddy comes in through the cellar door
he has his helmet back on his head and wears heavy working gloves
its going to be a private funeral
he crosses the room and starts climbing the stairs
both jonathan and einstein are now holding elaine
teddy tell these men who i am
teddy stops a few steps from floor level
oh thats my daughter alice
oh no teddy
now alice dont be a tomboy
dont play rough with the gentlemen
he pulls out his imaginary sword and rushes up the stairs
he rushes into his room and slams the door
elaine starts screaming
jonathan holds a handkerchief over her mouth
einstein runs to the front door and switches the lights off
doctor the cellar
let go of me
let go of me
the cellar door is opened and we see the shadows of the two men dragging elaine down to the cellar
whats the matter
whats happening down there
the lights are switched back on and we see abby and martha on the balcony just coming out of their room
they are both dressed in black funeral clothes
whats the matter

jonathan is coming alone out of the cellar
we caught a burglar a sneak thief

she starts going down the stairs followed by martha

abby stops at the top of the stairs
do you hear me
knocking on the door followed by the doorbell
the two sisters starts going down the stairs
dont answer that
the two sisters are running downstairs
dont answer that
elaine rushes through the cellar door screaming
she runs into marthas arms followed by einstein
let go of me
more knocking and ringing at the door
abby goes and opens the door
mortimer enters the house

elaine rushes to mortimer and holds him by the neck
he gets rid of her

he starts climbing the stairs and looks surprised at martha
what are you doing with your best clothes on
he suddenly notices jonathans presence and stops mounting the stairs
whats that thing there that looks like a cigar store dummy
its your brother jonathan and this is doctor einstein
aunt abby didnt i tell you not to let anybody in the house
who did you say it was
its your brother jonathan
elaine grabs mortimers coat and starts talking to him
so do abby and martha on either side of him

at the voice of jonathan the three women stop talking what

einstein pulls jonathans sleeve
mortimer bends down to look at jonathan foot then he touches his legs

he stands up and runs across the room to the window seat
he kneels on the window seat and looks through the open window
large shot of reverend harpers residence
elaine enters the front door and slams the door behind her
mortimer is still looking through the open window
he enters back into the room and sits on the window seat
whispering to himself oh let me sit down
let me think about this thing
doctor teddy signature
he looks at the seat
he remains seated a few seconds in deep thought then he gives a quick look outside the window stands up and starts lifting the lid
the lid creaks
mortimer seems very surprised by what he sees inside the seat
he opens the lid completely and let it rest on the bottom of the window
theres another one
he closes the lid and walks across the room toward the kitchen door
come in here
voice over from the kitchen were busy
no you come in here now
abby still in funeral clothes enters the room through the kitchen door
yes dear what is it

jonathan just walked in
i dont mean jonathan
and i dont mean doctor einstein
who is that in the window seat

he opens the window seat wide and let the lid rest on the bottom of the window
abby walks to the window seat and looks inside surprised
who can that be

i certainly am
well this is a fine how do you do
its getting so anyone thinks he can walk in this house
now you look here aunt abby

and if he came here to be buried in our cellar hes mistaken

by the way where is mister hoskins
mortimer starts looking around the room
he must have gone to panama

no no not yet
hes just down there waiting for the services poor dear
we havent had a minute what with jonathan in the house
mortimer suddenly realizes the corpse could be a friend of jonathan
he quickly closes the lid
weve always wanted to hold a double funeral
but i will not read services over a total stranger
she walks back to the kitchen
mortimer catches her
a total stranger
aunt abby how can i believe you
there are twelve men down there some you admit you poisoned them
yes i did
but you dont think id stoop to telling a fib
she enters the kitchen
what do you think has happened
mortimer starts dancing around the room
then he hears a door closing on the balcony and he sits on the window seat
we see jonathan on the balcony
he starts going downstairs
mortimer goes toward him
this may interest you mortimer
ive decided that were staying
and ive also decided that youre leaving and i mean now
im in no mood to debate the question

abby comes in through the kitchen door followed by martha

jonathan and mortimer both rushes across the room and sit on the window seat no
no no aunt abby dont
he stops when he realizes that jonathan is sitting with him
he suddenly understands the situation and shows a broad smile to his brother
he then stands up jonathan let aunt martha see whats in the window seat
jonathans face shows that he is no more so sure of himself
aunt abby darling i owe you an apology
he kisses her on the forehead

jonathan is leaving
and hes taking doctor einstein and that cold companion with him
to jonathan listen jonathan

jonathan doesnt move from the window seat

mortimer picks up the phone
i knew he was a foreigner
put down that telephone mortimer
jonathan puts his hand to his pocket to take his gun
the doorbell rings and we see a policemans shadow through the frosted glass
jonathan stands up and abby rushes to the door
she opens the door on ohara
he is smiling and hes got his stick in his hand
oh officer ohara

mortimer lets them in but comes back into the sitting room closing the kitchen door behind him

but ohara comes into the room and mortimer quickly closes the lid

mortimer closes the door behind ohara and turns toward jonathan

he enters the kitchen and closes the door behind him
einstein arrives silently behind jonathan and taps on this shoulder
jonathan turns quickly around
he then goes to the kitchen door and comes back to einstein

jonathan takes einsteins hand twists it and brings einstein down on the floor
jonathan releases einsteins hand who stands up to massage his hand
take the instruments and hide them in the cellar
einstein takes the suitcase and walks to the cellar
jonathan opens the lid of the window seat
in the kitchen the brewster sisters are moving around the room preparing food on the table
both men are standing up near the table
ohara without his cap on his head has a sandwich in his hand
mister brewster you dont know what goes on in brooklyn
oh i dont know
ohara picks up a cup on the table
my mother was an actress
of course she was
she was my mother
oh excuse me
peaches la tour was her name
the door to the cellar is open
einstein rushes up from the cellar
he looks a bit frightened
hey johnny johnny come quick
jonathan who was looking down into the open window seat stands up
whats the matter
you know that hole in the cellar
well we got an ace in the hole
jonathan closes the window seat and walks toward the cellar
ohara is explaining something to mortimer
its no fly by night idea
ive been working on this thing for twelve years
mortimer who had just heard the creaking of the lid of the window seat turns back toward the policeman
well you have
well rehash it in your mind
ill be back in a minute

but i didnt tell you the first act mister brew
before he can finish his sentence mortimer is already out of the room
mortimer enters the empty sitting room
he goes to the window seat opens it and talks to the corpse
no i thought i told you
he closes the lid kneels on the seat and looks through the open window
jonathan enters from the cellar followed by einstein
mortimer turns around and looks surprised at his brother
then he comes into the room what are you two doing still here
i thought i told you to beat it

youre not going
you stay out of this
all right you asked for it
he goes to the kitchen door which he opens slightly
voice over from the kitchen coming
mortimer comes back in the middle of the room
now if you tell ohara whats in the window seat ill tell him whats down in the cellar
theres an elderly gentleman down there who seems to be very dead
what were you doing down the cellar
but what is he doing in the cellar
now what are you going to tell ohara
ohara comes into the room from the kitchen

mortimer who was pushing ohara outside suddenly slaps his forehead with his hand
oh the doctor

mortimer closes the door

he goes to the desk and picks up his papers
he then turns to jonathan and einstein still standing by the cellar door
oh oh oh
youre smug arent you
you think youve got it over me
but you havent
you think im afraid to go to the police about spenalzo because youve got hold of hoskins
well im not
he taps on his papers
the moment i get spenalzo
i mean the moment the doctor signs this i dont care who knows about him hoskins i mean
and you better feel the same way about spenalzo
he starts running upstairs
where are you going
to the doctor
where do you
mortimer stops and starts running downstairs and then to the front door
when i come back i expect to find you gone
wait for me
he goes out and closes the door
einstein takes a sip at his bottle
well wait for him
did he look guilty
the two sisters come out of the kitchen
well martha i think we can start the services now
they stop when they see jonathan and einstein
we thought we heard you leave
perish the thought dear aunties
that was just mortimer
and speaking of services aunt martha will you make us some coffee while we take mister spenalzo down to the cellar
youve got to take him with you
jonathan opens the lid of the window seat
theres a friend of mortimers downstairs waiting for him
a friend of mortimers
take his feet doctor
mister spenalzo and he will get along fine together
theyre both dead
the two men bend down to take the corpse out of the window seat
he must mean mister hoskins
the two men stand up and look at the sisters
jonathan comes closer to them
you know about whats down there
of course we do
and hes no friend of mortimers
hes one of our gentlemen
and we wont have any strangers buried in our cellar
but mister hoskins
mister hoskins is no stranger
besides theres no room for mister spenalzo
the cellars crowded already
there are twelve graves down there now
the two men look at each other
jonathan seems the most surprised
that leaves very little room and were going to need it
you mean that you and aunt martha have murdered twelve
its one of our charities
why what weve been doing is a mercy
so you just take your mister spenalzo out of here
they turn to einstein who has seated himself and is laughing his head off
youve done all that right here in this house and buried them in the cellar
thats wonderful johnny
he stands up
weve been chased all over the world and they stay right here in brooklyn and they do just as good as you do
you got twelve they got twelve
jonathan grabs einstein by his shirt
ive got thirteen
no johnny twelve
they both starts counting on their fingers
theres mister spenalzo
then the first one in london

three in chicago and one in south bend

he looks menacingly at his two aunts who do not smile anymore
mortimer is walking along the gate of the churchyard dragging dr
gilchrist with him
gilchrist is trying to tie his necktie while walking
apparently mortimer didnt let him dress completely when he took him out of his home
im a very lucky man to have caught you at home doctor gilchrist
this is most irregular most irregular
im sorry to have dragged you out of bed but you see youre the only one who can help me
i know teddy blows bugles but i cant commit a man to an institution just on that
oh well if only you had a little talk with him i assure you youd be convinced by him
heres the house i
they stop walking when they hear hymns sung by the brewster sisters
there goes hoskins
mortimer looks embarrassed he doesnt want to explain to the doctor who hoskins is
did i say
he moves the doctor to the entrance of the churchyard
now you better wait
yes ill bring teddy out
well you see i wouldnt want to alarm the old ladies you know seeing a doctor and everything
you wait here huh
he helps him finish tying his necktie
in the cemetery
yeah thatll be good
oh dont worry about that

now look you wait here
make yourself comfortable
pull up a tombstone
ill be right back
he moves away to the house and passes near the taxi still waiting
oh yes looks good on you
he hasnt stop walking and goes into the house
the driver who had been following him stops near the entrance of the house
not the suit the meter
looks good on me
a quick shot of dr
gilchrist waiting frozen and slightly frightened
then back on the entrance of the house near which the driver is still standing
teddy and mortimer come out of the house
teddy is back in his president roosevelt costume
did you give him a twenty one gun salute
yes with a maxim silencer
the driver catches up with them
five more bucks and youll own it
mortimer and teddy dont stop walking
the driver follows them
oh no thanks
it wouldnt fit me
the two men reach the place where dr
gilchrist is waiting
oh mister president may i have the pleasure
teddy seems very happy to meet dr
gilchrist and shakes his hands vigorously
to the doctor well thats what he presumes
to teddy mister president the doctor would like to have a few words with you in private
he bows slightly
welcome to washington doctor
he shakes his hand again then puts his arm around the doctors shoulders and moves away with him into the churchyard
arlington is beautiful at this time of year is it not doctor
the doctor looks back at mortimer seeming a little frightened
mortimer remains alone with the papers in his hand
we still hear the hymns sung by the brewster sisters in the background
well now thats that
it gives me a chance to rest
he sits down on a tombstone
reverse shot on reverend harpers house
elaine opens the window of her room
back to mortimer seated on his tombstone
a little further behind him we see teddy and the doctor talking
well so far so good
he stands up
not so good
he runs to elaines window
the cab driver looks at the scene with intrigued eyes
mortimer is now outside elaines window
do you or do you not love me
elaine how can you say such a thing
darling of course i love you
mortimer takes her in his arms
hey then why have you been treating me the way you have
he moves slightly away from her
elaine elaine darling i love you so much i cant go through with our marriage
she goes slightly back into her room
have you suddenly gone crazy
no no i dont think so but its only a matter of time
now look darling you wouldnt want to have children with three heads would you
i mean you wouldnt want to set up housekeeping in a padded cell
what are you talking about
well i dont quite know really
look i probably should have told you this before but you see
well insanity runs in my family
we hear very clearly the brewster sisters singing their hymns
it practically gallops
oh darling just because teddys a little strange that doesnt mean
oh no darling no no
its way back before teddy
no this goes back to the first brewster the one who came over on the mayflower
you know you know how in those days the indians used to scalp the settlers
well he used to scalp the indians
elaine bends out of her window to hug mortimer
darling thats ancient history
medium shot on the doctor and teddy walking arm in arm among the tombstones
yes doctor ill run for a third term but i wont be elected
and thatll mean the last of the roosevelts in the white house
thats what you think
of course if the country insists
back to elaines room window
the young couple is still talking on either side of the window
oh darling all this doesnt prove a thing
look at your aunts
theyre brewsters arent they
theyre the sweetest sanest people ive ever known
he turns around to listen to his aunts singing their hymns
well even they have their peculiarities
what of it
so your familys crazy
so youre crazy
thats the way i want you the way i love you
im crazy too but kiss me
mortimer hesitates a little and then gives a passionate kiss to elaine
back to teddy and the doctor
teddy is vigorously shaking the doctors hand
ive enjoyed this little talk very much
anytime youre in washington drop in to see me at the white house
he walks away leaving the doctor very shaken by the experience
the doctor runs to mortimer still outside elaines window and kissing her passionately
the doctor clears loudly his throat to attract mortimers attention
mortimer suddenly realizes what the doctor is talking about
he pulls the papers from his jacket pocket and gives them to the doctor
ill enjoy committing him to any place
ive just been appointed ambassador to bolivia
ah you see
didnt i tell you
elaine suddenly slams her window down
on mortimers fingers
mortimer yells because of the pain
the doctor looks up from the papers
elaine also shut the inside shade down shutting the room completely from the outside world
dont worry about that
just go on signing the papers
mortimer blows on his hurt fingers then grabs the papers from the doctor and runs away
okay thank you
close up on the empty window seat where just remains mr
from the open cellar door martha is coming out followed by abby
they are still dressed in their funeral clothes
well find out whose house this is
im warning you you better stop it
theres no use doing what youre doing because itll just have to be undone
voice over from the cellar aunt abby go to bed
its a terrible thing to do to bury a good methodist with a foreigner
mortimer comes rushing into the room with the papers in his hand
he blows on the papers to dry the ink of the signature
mortimer where have you been
mortimer starts running upstairs
oh i was getting some papers signed
is teddy in his room
oh mortimer what is the matter with you
running around getting papers signed at a time like this
martha and i are going for the police
he quickly get back downstairs oh oh oh
wait wait wait
you cant go for the police
you know what jonathans doing
hes putting mister hoskins and mister spenalzo in together
oh darling let him
einstein just finished working and he is cleaning the bottom of his pants
we notice he is wearing mr
a shovel is resting on the wall near him
this is all fixed up nice now
nice and smooth like a lake
the president will be very proud of his panama canal
he stretches himself oh johnny bed feels good already
you know we didnt get any sleep for forty eight hours
jonathan walks behind him carrying a shovel
he puts the shovel down against the wall and start mounting the stairs youre forgetting doctor
mortimer is trying to calm his aunts down now look
if jonathan and mister spenalzo arent out this house before morning were going for the police
yeah but ill get them out i promise you that
then you get the wedding silver
yes but remember no police
he starts mounting the stairs
theres a thing
look go to bed will you
get out of those clothes
you two look like a double blackout
he reaches the balcony
jonathan is standing on the bottom of the cellar staircase
my brother mortimer
he goes back down in the cellar toward einstein who has his bottle in his hand
i just heard him upstairs
no no no
i am tired
you forget i got to operate on your face tomorrow
he sits down on the bottom steps of the stairs
we just see his shadow on the wall behind einstein you are going to operate tomorrow doctor
but tonight we are taking care of mortimer
no but johnny not tonight
well do it tomorrow
or the next day
voice over from the shadow on the wall look at me doctor
you can see that its got to be done cant you
yeah i know that look
voice over from the shadow on the wall its a little late to dissolve our partnership
okay okay johnny okay
well do it
but the quick way huh
the quick twist like in london
he mimes the breaking of a neck with his fingers and then takes a sip from his bottle voice over from the shadow on the wall no doctor
i think this calls for something special
i think perhaps the melbourne method
not the melbourne method please
and then when it was all over what
the fellow in london was just as dead as the fellow in melbourne
teddy comes out of his room on the balcony in his president roosevelt costume
he takes his bugle to his mouth ready to play it
mortimer comes out of the room and lowers the bugle
no no no
dont do that mister president
but i cannot sign any proclamation without consulting my cabinet
mortimer puts the papers in front of his eyes
this must be secret
teddy takes the papers and looks at them
a secret proclamation
yes its the only way we can outsmart the other fellow
whos the other fellow
thats the secret
oh i see
well if its a a secret proclamation it has to be signed in secret
he folds the papers
of course mister president
ill have to put on my signing clothes
he starts to move back to his room
mortimer stops him
oh you already have them on mister president
teddy looks at his costume
so i have
he goes back into his room and closes the door
einstein appears at the bottom of the stairs
hey mister brewster
yes what is it
einstein climbs the stairs very rapidly
he takes mortimer by the sleeve and whispers to him
hey mister brewster you get out of this house
cant you see im busy
he tries to get rid of einsteins hand on his sleeve
we hear the bugle playing the first notes of beethovens fifth symphony
singing the same tune ta ta ta taaa
he knocks on teddys door
the papers are slid under the door
mortimer bends down to pick them up
thank you mister president
oh what a load off my mind
boy could i use a drink
thank god for that
he starts going downstairs
einstein follows him and takes his sleeve again
whispering get out of here will you please
what did you say
speak up sonny
i cant hear you
still whispering johnnys in a bad mood
you get out of here
i cant hear you
please listen to me
mortimer gets rid of einsteins hands on his sleeves
stop all this
what are you doing
are you really a doctor
he takes his sleeve again and tries to move him to the front door
howd you come to hook up with jonathan
i tell you later about that but you go now
please listen to me
theyve reached the front door
mortimer takes einsteins hand out of his sleeve
tch tch tch
stop it doctor now stop it
you get out of here
look look when johnnys in that mood hes a madman
hes a maniac
and then things happen
he mimes the cutting of his own throat and takes mortimers hand to throw him out
you get out of here
will you stop it
now look stop telling me about jonathan ill take care of jonathan and you take care of yourself
now get going little fellow
he opens the door to throw him out
he pats him on the behind to move him and discover the shape of the bottle under his hand
wait a minute
he takes the bottle out of einsteins pocket oh no
i could use that
i could use that
he tries to get his bottle back but mortimer holds on it
only for dramatic critics
now look you beat it before things start popping around here
he moves away to the table with the bottle in his hand
einstein joins his hand in a praying gesture
but look mr
youve just been married
you have a nice little wife waiting for you
please go now
mortimer pours some of the schnapps in a glass
einstein slams the front door with a very nervous punch and walks toward mortimer
he mumbles incomprehensible words probably in german
tell me dont those plays you see all the time teach you anything
mortimer is drinking
he lowers his glass
oh stop it dont get me on the subject of plays
ive got a lot on my mind now
ive got to wait here for mister witherspoon
he looks at his watch
at least people in plays act like they got sense
oh you think so
did you ever see anybody in a play ever act like they got intelligence
how can somebody be so stupid
you ought to have my job a few nights
listen to me brother
when you get out of prison you have yourself wheeled over to the garrick theater
theres a play there thats been running so bad that itll still be running when you get out
now in this theres a man
now listen to this
behind mortimer the cellar door opens silently and jonathan enters slowly into the room without mortimer noticing him
now he knows hes in the house with murderers
so he ought to know hes in danger
hes even been warned to get out of the house
and does he go
no he doesnt
this fellow doesnt even have sense to be scared or to be on his guard
the murderer even invites him to sit down
what do you think he does
well i dont know
he sits down
i remember what he did
he deliberately pulls up a chair like that and he sits down in it
mortimer goes to a wooden armchair and sits down in it
he puts his glass on the table
isnt that great
so there he is all waiting to be trussed up and gagged
what do you think they used to truss him up with
he keeps on laughing while talking
close up of jonathans face smiling
voice over oh what
voice over the curtain cord
jonathan looks in the direction of the window
and the curtain cord
but didnt he see him get it
behind the seated mortimer jonathan is silently walking to the window
seen him get it
the silly chump sits down with his back toward the murderer
mortimer turns slightly on his chair but without taking his eyes off einstein and of course without looking at his brother behind him quietly cutting the curtain cords with a
all he has to do is look around but does he
medium shot on jonathan cutting the curtain cords
voice over no
look you see brother heidelberg in a play or even in a movie for that matter
a fellow never sees or hears anything
jonathan folds the jack knife and puts it in his pocket
he prepares the cords he has just cut
einstein takes a napkin on the table
but what does he do
oh what does he do
well the big chump sits there
this fellows supposed to be bright
he sits there
jonathan is now just behind mortimers chair with the cord ready in his hands
now get a load of this
look look at the attitude
large as life
he sits there waiting to be tied up and gagged
the big dope
he bursts out laughing
but only for two seconds because jonathan ties up his arm to the armchair from behind and einstein shoves the napkin in his open mouth
einstein then helps jonathan to tie mortimers legs to the legs of the armchair
then with the help of a knife he puts all the napkin in mortimers mouth
you were right about that fellow
he wasnt very bright
fade out and then fade in on the same scene a few moments later
the lights have been dimmed
mortimer is completely tied on the chair and the gag is tied around his head
ive been away for twenty years
but never my dear brother were you out of my mind
jonathan is lighting candles on the table
in melbourne one night i dreamt of you
he opens his instruments case
we see the surgery instruments shining in the candles light
close up on mortimers very frightened face
einstein sits down near the table
he seems depressed at the sight of his surgery instruments
jonathan takes a small phial from the inside pocket of his jacket opens it smells it and closes it and puts it back in his pocket
the more you struggle mortimer the more you strangle yourself
later on you may consider that a blessing
he takes a curved forceps from the case and plays with it
close up on mortimers frightened face
einstein wipes his face with a napkin
jonathan takes a scalpel from the case and feels the sharpness of the blade
einstein takes a bottle on the table and brings it to his mouth
unfortunately the bottle is empty
jonathan takes a pair of surgery gloves from the box and puts them on
now doctor we go to work
einstein stands up
johnny for me please the quick way
doctor this must be an artistic achievement
after all were performing before a very distinguished critic
einstein takes his jacket off
he is almost crying
lets get it over with
no but johnny i cannot see this without a drink
pull yourself together doctor
but i cant pull myself together without a drink
johnny you remember when we came in here there was some wine
and then they took it
where did they put it
a glint of hope appears in mortimers eyes at the mention of his aunts wine
einstein runs across the room to the shelves where the carafe of poisoned wine has been put away
johnny i found some wine
i found some wine
he comes back to the table with the carafe and glasses
here ill split it with you
we both have a drink before we operate
oh i am so happy that we dont have to operate without a drink
einstein gives a glass to jonathan
mortimer who recognized the carafe is smiling behind his gag
jonathan smells the glass
einstein has his glass almost to his lips when jonathan stops him
one moment please
where are your manners
to mortimer yes mortimer
i realize now that it was you who brought me back to brooklyn
we drink to you
to my dear dead brother
they clink their glass in front of mortimers face
einstein raises his glass before drinking
teddy suddenly comes out of his room and plays his bugle very loudly
both jonathan and einstein drop their glass on the floor
teddy then goes back into his room and slams the door
the grand father clock chimes once
mortimer seems very disappointed
he moves back and forth in his chair moaning
he goes next
he goes next
well get to him later
not teddy we wont get to him at all
now we have to work fast
the quick way
oh the quick way oh yes
if it has to be then the quick way
yes ill help you with it
they starts getting the instruments out of the case
at the front door we see the shadow of a policeman behind the frosted glass
he rings the doorbell
jonathan and einstein stop what they were doing
einstein closes the case and puts it under the table
he also puts all the instruments lying on the table on the floor behind the case
knocking on the door
the door being open ohara enters the room
he spots jonathan and einstein
hey the colonel has to quit blowing that horn
its all right officer
were taking the bugle away from him
id better talk to him myself
wheres the lights
he finds the switch by the door and switches the lights on
he goes to the stairs and starts mounting them when he hears mortimer moaning
he goes down and walks toward mortimer
you stood me up
ive been waiting for you for over an hour at kellys
what happened to him
ohara is surprised to find mortimer tied up on his chair
he points his stick to jonathan
he was explaining a play he saw the other night and thats what happened to a poor man in the play
he walks away with his jacket in his hands
oh i see
did that really happen in a play you saw
how do you like that
you cant trust nobody no more
they practically stole that from the second act of my play
you know in the second act just
well maybe id better start at the beginning
mortimer is moving and moaning on his chair
he tries to explain by movements of his face that he would like to have his gag taken off
behind ohara einstein starts mounting the stairs and jonathan stands up at the bottom of them
oh yes sure
he puts his hands to mortimers face to take off his gag
einstein runs upstairs followed by jonathan
suddenly ohara removes his hands and smiles broadly
youve got to hear the plot
he takes his jacket off
my mothers sitting there making up see
and like a flash suddenly out of a clear sky the door comes open and a man with a black mustache comes in
on the stairs behind ohara jonathan takes his jack knife out of his pocket and opens it
he turns to my mother and he says miss peaches la tour will you marry me
thats the first scene
my mother doesnt tell him theyre married
thats the surprise
einstein who has seen the knife tries to stop jonathan
but jonathan keeps on walking slowly downstairs
oh what a kick
twenty five years pass
well in the meantime theres me
growing into a magnificent specimen
so what do i do
i join the police force and become one of new yorks finest
well im cleaning out a crooked laundry see
close up on jonathans hand holding the knife the blade of which is shining in the light
mortimer stares at the knife little do i know it but there is a dope fiend with a long knife crawling after me
im in great danger
its getting you aint it
i can see it in your eyes
actually mortimers eyes are trying to attract oharas attention to jonathan just behind him now
well you aint heard nothing yet
einstein tries to stop jonathan but jonathan pushes him away
einstein takes off one of his shoes and hits jonathan very hard on the head with it
jonathan falls on the floor
all of a sudden a fire breaks out
what an effect
the firemen rush in and who do you think is leading them
mayor fiorello la guardia
ohara turns around and sees jonathan lying on the last steps of the stairs
whats the matter with him
yeah probably your play put him to sleep
i personally i like it very much
its probably over his head huh
ohara looks at jonathans face
where have i seen that face before
he kneels beside jonathans body and ohara returns to mortimer
well the scene changes
its an evolving stage
im walking along my beat well like that casual like when a guy that im following it turns out hes really following me
knocks at the door
ohara turns to einstein
to einstein dont let nobody in
to mortimer i figure ill outsmart him
theres a vacant house on the corner
einstein peeks through the drapes to have a look at the outside of the front door
he rushes to jonathan
hey johnny the cops
einstein tries to wake up jonathan but doesnt succeed
he picks up his shoe and rushes upstairs
so i ducks in there
i sees the door handle turn so i pulls out my gun braces myself against the wall and i says come in
he takes out his gun and points it at the door
brophy and another cop officer saunders come in
when they see oharas gun pointing at them they raise their arms
ohara puts his gun back in his holster and welcomes his colleagues
oh hello boys
what the sam hills going on here
hello sarge what do you think this is mortimer brewster
hes going to help me write my play
do you have to tie him up to make him listen
he starts to untie mortimer
ohara you better report in the station
why didnt you ring in
you got the whole force out looking for you
right in the middle of the second act
did they send you guys here looking for me
brophy goes to the telephone and starts dialing
no we came to warn the old ladies
there is a difficulty
the colonel blew that bugle again
yeah i heard him
the neighbors are all phoning in
the lieutenants on the warpath
he says weve got to put him away someplace
he sees jonathan lying on the steps
now who the heck is this
oh thats mister brewsters brother
my play put him to sleep
thats the one that ran away
so he came back
in the phone brophy
get me mac
to ohara havent you got yourself in a mess
youre two hours overdue at the station
i better let them know that i found you
ohara bends on jonathan and shakes him hey
it wasnt that bad was it
in the phone mac
tell the lieutenant he can call off the big manhunt
we found him
at the brewster house
shall we bring him in
all right well hold him right here
he puts the phone down and turns to ohara who has succeeded in waking up jonathan and getting him on his feet
jonathan stares at brophy
he thinks brophy is talking about him
mortimer looks at his left hand which has just been freed by saunders
the lieutenant is on his way over
so ive been turned in hey
all right youve got me
i suppose you and my stool pigeon brother will split the reward
brophy and ohara each take one arm of jonathan
now ill do some turning in
mortimer who had his hand and legs untied by saunders but is still gagged and has his chest still tied on the armchair moans and moves excitedly on his seat
to jonathan oh wait a minute mr
you think my aunts are sweet charming old ladies dont you
well theres thirteen bodies buried in the cellar
mortimer jumps on his chair and try to scream through his gag
since he cannot succeed to get off the chair he stands up still gagged and tied to the back of the chair and rushes to brophy carrying the armchair with
be careful what you say about your aunts they happen to be friends of ours
ill show them to you
dont you make any trouble for them do you hear me
mortimer walks between brophy and jonathan and tries to say something to brophy through his gag
saunders behind mortimer keeps on untying him
to mortimer never mind mr
leave him to me ill take care of him
to ohara you come down to the cellar
to jonathan now wait a minute
mortimer is still trying to talk through his gag to ohara and brophy and moves excitedly around the two cops
he moves so much that saunders has stopped trying to untie him
ill show you where theyre buried
go down to the cellar with him ohara
yes come to the cellar
he grabs oharas hand and drags him to the cellar door
well look do i have to
mortimer still gagged and still carrying his armchair like a backpack tries to follow them but saunders moves him away
mortimer runs round the table to try again to join the party going down to the cellar with saunders running behind him
sorry maybe i dont want to go down to the cellar with him
mortimer bumps violently into brophy who tries to push him away
ohara go on down the cellar with him
mortimer then goes to ohara but ohara doesnt realize mortimer is coming to him to prevent him going down to the cellar
now please mister brewster
ill tell you the rest of my play later
he pushes mortimer away from him
go on down to the cellar with him
gee do i have to sarge
look at that puss
he looks like boris karloff
hearing that jonathan screams jumps on ohara and puts his hand around his throat
to jonathan dont
to brophy sarge
the three cops and jonathan starts fighting
a fist comes out of the battle and hits mortimer on the chin
he staggers back to the center of the room and falls on the floor
we see einstein cautiously appearing on the landing of the upper floor of the house
he slowly comes down the stairs
down in the sitting room the fight goes on
saunders falls on his back and jonathan jumps on him
ohara in his turn jumps on jonathan
behind them mortimer is slowly getting up and getting rid of his ropes
apparently his fall has completely untied him
einstein watching this heated fight moves back to the upper floor
mortimer gets rid of his gag and slowly moves away from the battle
voice over look out pat
look out pat
voice over hes got a gun
voice over i got him pat
go on and fight
mortimer climbs up a few steps on the staircase and sits down on a step
thats enough thats enough
voice over pat
pat look out
mortimer still seated on the step quietly gets his cigarette case from his pocket takes a cigarette puts the case back in his pocket while we hears the noise of
the battle still going on down below
such a fine day too
all i did was cross the bridge and i was in brooklyn
he takes a matchbox from another pocket and lights his cigarette
behind mortimer on the wall we see the shadows of the men fighting
then we see various objects falling around mortimer
dont bother me now
ohara is projected on the wall below the staircase near the place where mortimer is still quietly seated
buddy you could use this in the third act
oh yes i got something better than this
let me tell you
jonathan breaks a chair on his back
ohara staggers slightly
ill see you later
he goes back in the battle
jonathan gives him a heavy punch and ohara falls in the window seat closing the lid over himself in his fall
back to mortimer still quietly smoking his cigarette seated on the same step
he takes papers out of his pocket
i got the papers signed
there theyre all signed
what do i care
go ahead go ahead fight fight fight fight fight
ohara cautiously lifts the lid of the window seat but seeing a chair flying in his direction he slams it back shut
the chair hits the window seat and breaks off in small pieces
back to mortimer on his steps
he puts the papers back in his pocket
id better call up and see if witherspoon has left
he puts his hand through the banister of the staircase to take the telephone on the desk but he cannot reach it
at this moment jonathan comes smashing on the wall below the staircase
he grabs the telephone and lifts it to throw it on the cops bringing it within easy reach of mortimers hand
ill get every one of you
i hate cops
ill brain the first one that comes near me
mortimer picks up the telephone handset and starts dialing
a little higher please brother
jonathan is watching the cops around him and he is not looking at all at his brother behind him
without thinking about it he lifts the telephone a little higher
thank you very much
yeah thats fine
jonathan suddenly realizes what mortimer is doing and turns his head toward him
brophy immediately comes behind him and hits him with his stick
jonathan starts falling and mortimer has to pick up the telephone not to loose it
dont do that please
get him pat
saunders comes on the other side of jonathan and hits him with his stick
in the phone come on doc
to the cops that wont have any effect
ive tried it before
jonathan falls heavily on the floor
oh it did
isnt that amazing
ohara slowly lifts the lid of the window seat
saunders bends on the motionless body of jonathan oh dear
wish i could relax like that
the doorbell rings and we see the shadow of a hatted man through the frosted glass
mortimer looks at the door
the visitor enters
its lieutenant rooney a plain cloth policeman
he closes the door behind him
both brophy and saunders stand at attention
mortimer puts the phone receiver back on its hook
ohara comes out of the window seat and seeing his superior stands at attention
rooney walks to the body of jonathan
what has occurred
speaking together well we
didnt i tell you id handle this myself
ohara comes out of the window seat to join his colleagues
we were just acting in self defense
pointing to the body of jonathan what happened
he put up a fight
this isnt the one who blows the bugle
this is his brother
he tried to kill ohara
all i said was he looked like boris karloff
turn him over
saunders turns jonathan over and both the lieutenant and brophy bends on the face of jonathan
kind of think hes wanted somewhere
rooney stands up and looks at brophy with an ironical smile
you kind of think hes wanted somewhere
if you guys cant look at the circulars we put up in the station you can at least read short detective stories
certainly hes wanted somewhere
he escaped from the prison for criminally insane
hes a lifer
still seated on his step mortimer smiles
thats my brother
for petes sake thats the way they described him
he looked like karloff
whyd you have to knock him off
he tried to get us to go down to the cellar
he says there are thirteen bodies buried down there
thirteen bodies buried in the cellar and that dont tip you off the guys come from a nuthouse
say lieutenant about my not ringing in i want to explain
where have you been all night
dont bother to tell me
oh i was right here writing a play with mortimer brewster
well youre going to have a long time on that play
now go on
teddy comes out of his room with his bugle under his arm and walks downstairs voice over take this guy out in the kitchen and bring a pillow
i want to find out where his accomplice is
to mortimer what is the meaning of this commotion
the guy who helped him escape
hes wanted too
teddy gives his bugle to mortimer
he joins the group of policemen
forty eight hours ive been after these guys
nothing to eat
no wonder brooklyns in the shape its in
with flatheads like you on the force
falling for a story like that
thirteen bodies buried down in the cellar
but there are thirteen bodies in the cellar
who are you
im president roosevelt
whispering to brophy what the blazes is this
hes the guy that blows the bugle
saunders and brophy both salutes teddy
teddy salutes them back
rooney raises his hand to salute but rapidly puts it down with a disgusted expression on his face
well colonel youve blown your last bugle
pointing to jonathans body come on get this guy out of here
another yellow fever victim
all the bodies in the cellar are yellow fever victims
no no no colonel
this is a spy
we caught him at the white house
take him out and bring him to
i want to question him
brophy and saunders lift jonathan and carry him to the kitchen
if there is any questioning of spies thats my department
he follows the two cops
but rooney stops him
hey you keep out of that
youre forgetting that as president i am also head of the secret service
he follows the two cops in the kitchen
rooney goes to the table takes the carafe and smells it
mortimer watches him still seated on his step
huh huh huh
rooney puts the carafe back on the table and looks at mortimer
who are you
whats your name
usually im mortimer brewster
but im not quite myself today
oh youre his brother
now look mister brewster no argument
hes got to be put away
mortimer stands up and goes down the steps toward the lieutenant
no no no arguments captain
just a minute take it easy
he takes the papers from his pocket and show them to rooney
teddys going to go to happy dale tonight
im just waiting here for mr
rooney looks at the documents
well as long as hes going someplace
hes scaring the neighbors what with that bugle and all
and that cockeyed story about thirteen bodies being buried
rooney stops looks around with a suspicious eye and takes his hat off
you know ive been without sleep for forty eight hours
im liable to think anything
i know just how you feel
theres people dumb enough to believe a story like that
last year there was a crazy guy started a murder rumor
i had to dig up a half acre plot before i could prove
rooney puts the papers down
whats the matter
these papers are no good
he signed it theodore roosevelt
rooney shows the papers to mortimer
mortimer looks at the papers with horror in his face and takes them back
the cab driver is seated with ohara and witherspoon standing on either side of him
is your cab engaged
im losing dough every minute
got me offers
im mister witherspoon of happy dale sanitarium i have come here to collect a brewster
i would like you to drive us back to the sanitarium
he walks to the entrance of the house
ohara stays with the cab driver
i knew this would end up in a nuthouse
witherspoon comes back a few steps
we like to think of it as a rest home
witherspoon enters the room
we hear voices talking excitedly
and we see people in some sort of a large alcove at the back of the sitting room between the cellar door and the grandfather clock
through the hole in the kitchen door we see brophy talking
witherspoon is here
witherspoon slams the door
in the alcove mortimer rooney and teddy are having an argument
mortimer still has the bugle in his hand
supposing the spy steals this document and finds the name theodore roosevelt on it
think what that would mean to the safety of the nation
rooney holds the document for teddy who has a pen in his hand
no its chicanery
oh wasting the time
saunders approaches his lieutenant
hes come to
hes ready to talk
hold him till i get there
he moves away back to the kitchen
let me explain
the name brewster is code for roosevelt
code for roosevelt
yes dont you see
take the name brewster
take away the b and what have you got
and what does a rooster do
and where are you hunting in africa
on the veldt
there you are
mortimer gives a quick look at rooney
my compliments to the boys in the code department
hey thats all right
do that again for me
give me that pen
this is fun
he signs the paper under rooneys supervision
now now all i got to get is witherspoon
he runs to the table in the middle of the sitting room where witherspoon is standing
he goes around the table to shake hands with him
mister witherspoon i cant tell you how glad i am to see you
you will take good care of teddy at happy dale
best of care of him mister brewster
oh thats fine
and no wagon when he leaves
to take him away
oh never never
i have one waiting now
yes look it means a great deal to me
you will personally see that teddys happy at happy dale
hell be very happy at happy dale
oh thats good
you know i sometimes envy some of our patients secretly you know
oh you do
it must be a nice place
because ive never been to happy dale
you never can tell
mortimer looks surprised by witherspoons answer
then he looks also a bit horrified
oh this is a particularly happy moment for me tonight mister
yes ive never met a dramatic critic and i had been so anxious to
oh the woods are full of them
i have here something that will explain what were trying to do out there at happy dale
he gets a booklet out of his pocket
a pamphlet about happy dale
oh no no its a play
something ive been working on for some time now
when mortimer sees witherspoon flipping the pages of his booklet a slightly frightened look comes to his face
its a dramatization of many of the little incidents that have happened here at happy dale
rooney who was checking the documents signed by teddy turns around
now i want you to read this very carefully
i want you to be just as harsh as you like
i shant mind you know
rooney comes toward them with the documents in his hand
captain this is mister witherspoon
witherspoon looks at rooney with a smile
oh yes yes hell be very happy at happy dale
come my boy
witherspoon takes rooneys arm
rooney pushes him away
what is this
no no no no mister witherspoon you got it wrong
this is captain rooney
the two men shake hands and rooney gives the papers to witherspoon
here are the papers all signed
now you can take him away super
teddy joins them
ill be in my office vetoing some bills
mister president i have good news for you
your term of office is over
is this march the four
now i go on my hunting trip to africa
well i must get started immediately
teddy starts walking away but he stops suddenly and gives witherspoon a suspicious look
is he trying to move into the white house before ive moved out
who mister president
teddy looks at witherspoon with a disgusted face
no no teddy this isnt mister taft
its mister witherspoon hes going to be your guide to africa
teddy shakes hands with witherspoon
wait right here
ill bring down my equipment
witherspoon looks at teddy walking away with a sweet smile
teddy starts going upstairs and he meets abby and martha coming down
theyre dressed back in their usual clothes
teddy shakes hands with them
goodbye aunt abby goodbye aunt martha
im on my way to africa
isnt it wonderful
for the last time teddy takes out his imaginary sword points it forward and rushes upstairs
he gets into his room and slams the door behind him
witherspoon looks a bit surprised and mortimer holds the hands of the grandfather clock
abby joins him its all right aunt abby ive got it
witherspoon looks at the scene with slightly anxious eyes
and happy dale is full of staircases
elaine walks across the churchyard toward the brewsters house
she is wearing a coat over her nightdress
abby and martha are talking with witherspoon
youve come to meet teddy havent you
voice over no hes come to take him
teddys been blowing his bugle again
both sisters turn toward rooney
oh no no no he cant go now
we wont permit it
we promise to take his bugle away from him
we wont be separated from teddy
mortimer how can you allow this
mister brewsters got nothing to do with this see
the law is the law
teddys committed himself and hes got to go
well if hes going were going too
yes youll have to take us with him
mortimer smiles broadly
why not indeed
oh well now indeed its sweet of them to want to go but its quite impossible
we never take sane people at happy dale
mortimer comes very close to witherspoon and tries by mime only to induce witherspoon to take his aunts
oh no no no no
whispering now these two little sane people mixed up with all the others will get lost in the shuffle
you could arrange that
oh no no no no
just put them in and theyll get all mixed up
elaine has now reached the brewster house and opens a window
we hear lieutenant rooneys voice
voice over now lets be sensible ladies
rooney is talking to the brewster sisters
here i am wasting my time when i could be doing some serious work
you know ladies there are still murders to be solved in brooklyn
it aint only his bugle blowing and neighbors being afraid of him
but things are going to get worse
were liable to have to dig up your cellar
mortimer seems a bit worried
yeah teddys been telling around theres thirteen bodies buried in the cellar
but there are thirteen bodies in our cellar
witherspoon who was looking at something on the table looks up very surprised by what abby just said
behind the window and the drapes where she is hiding and eavesdropping elaine looks very surprised too
rooney smiles a little and then becomes suddenly very serious
you just ask our nephew mortimer
mortimer blows the bugle very loudly
rooney puts his hands on his ears
then mortimer rushes upstairs yelling charge
mortimer reaches the balcony
teddy comes out of his room looking intrigued whispering isnt that amazing
now mortimer you behave yourself
you know very well there are thirteen bodies down in our cellar
certainly theres thirteen bodies down in the cellar
and there are hundreds more up in the attic captain
teddy taps the side of his head with his finger goes back into his room and closes the door
mortimer tries to indicate by mime that his aunts are crazy what is this
very quick shot of elaine peeking behind the drapes you mustnt mind mortimer
saunders comes to his lieutenant
how about it lieutenant
ill be right there
he moves away
hes been a little strange all day
well right now i wouldnt know what is and what aint strange anymore
ill better have a look in that cellar
ill tell you what well do captain
ill bring my bodies down from the attic and you get yours down from the cellar and well get them all together and well send them to happy dale
he sings the last words trying again to mime to rooney that his two aunts are crazy
no no you wouldnt have to dig
the graves are all marked
we put flowers on them every sunday
mortimer walks downstairs
sure i put neon lights on mine
he whispers to rooney from the staircase
humor them humor them
rooney doesnt seem to understand what mortimer is trying to tell him
but witherspoon is beginning to understand
theres one down there a mister spenalzo
whispering hasnt got it yet
he resumes his walking downstairs
who doesnt belong here and whos going to have to leave
but the other twelve are our gentlemen
oh youd like mine better
none of mine are gentlemen
you mustnt mind him at all
he got married today
singing there is a happy dale far far away
there is a happy while singing mortimer makes signs to rooney and witherspoon
and finally rooney understand what mortimer is trying to tell him that his aunts are crazy
nodding yeah yeah
he got it
to witherspoon look super dont you think you can find room for the ladies
just the ladies
he looks at mortimer
mortimer stops clowning and becomes very serious
just the ladies not me
how about it super
well of course theyd have to be committed
well teddy committed himself
couldnt they commit themselves also
all they have to do is sign the papers
oh well if we can go with teddy well sign the papers
where are they
witherspoon takes the papers out of the inside pocket of his coat
i have them ladies i have them right here
to witherspoon sign them up will you super
i want this all cleaned up
im going out to talk to that spy
maybe i can understand him
thirteen bodies down in the cellar
rooney absent mindedly is ready to go down to the cellar but he checks himself and goes toward the kitchen instead
ladies if you will sign right here
elaine opens a large trapdoor opening on a stairway going down to the cellar
she starts going down that passage
einstein walks on the balcony carrying a suitcase and starts going downstairs
in the room we can guess that the two sisters are signing the papers
voice over right here
voice over yes please
its on the right hand side right there
martha and abby are seated at the table signing the papers
witherspoon and mortimer standing besides them are helping them
im really looking forward to going
the neighborhood here has changed so
especially since they won that old pennant thing
oh dear im so sorry
weve overlooked something
its absolutely compulsory that we have the signature of a physician
einstein has reached the bottom of the stairs and he is sneaking out through the front door
come here and sign some papers please
einstein turns around
come here doctor einstein
oh yes yes
doctor einstein almost operated on me earlier this evening
come on doctor
einstein drops his suitcase by the front door and comes to the table
just sign right here please doctor
einstein signs the paper mortimer gives him
meanwhile rooney and saunders are coming out of the kitchen and crossing the room
were you leaving doctor
arent you going to wait for jonathan
i dont think we go to the same place
speaking on the telephone hello mac
we picked up that guy thats wanted in indiana
his accomplices description is one on the circular on the desk
read it to me will you
einstein leaves the table and almost bumps into saunders who is brushing his uniform
he listen to the description of himself that rooney is repeating from his colleague at the police station
still on the phone yeah
five foot three
one hundred and forty pounds
talks with a german accent
poses as a doctor
he puts the phone back on its hook
witherspoon slaps einstein on the back and einstein starts raising his arms
its all right lieutenant rooney
the doctor here has completed the signatures
oh thats great
youve done brooklyn a great service
he shakes einsteins hand and slaps his back
einstein cannot believe his luck
he smiles and rushes to the door
einstein picks up his suitcase and rushes out of the door and closes it behind him
to mortimer now mister witherspoon
no no youre mister witherspoon im mister brewster
laughing its contagious yes
its your turn
now dont play games
you sign as next of kin
oh next of kin
why didnt you say so
im all confused
dont mind me
teddy appears on the balcony all dressed up in his colonial costume but without the helmet
mortimer picks up a spoon on the table and gives it to witherspoon
oh here it is
come up and pack my duffel
pack his duffel
hes president you know
and bring along my bugle
witherspoon looks on the table where the bugle is and then at mortimer
mortimer makes a little agreement sign
witherspoon picks up the bugle and starts walking upstairs
he stops after a few steps as if he were hesitating
mortimer and witherspoon are exchanging faces
martha and abby are whispering into each others ear
mortimer were really very worried about something
oh now darling dont be worried
he kisses abby
me too mortimer
well of course darling
he kisses martha
youll both are going to be very happy at happy dale will you
oh yes dear were very happy about the whole thing but thats just it
we dont want anything to go wrong
well what would go wrong
mortimer will they investigate those signatures
oh no they wont look up dr
but its not his signature dear
you see you signed as next of kin
oh whats wrong about that darling
martha you tell him now
youre not really a brewster
mortimer who had a happy smile on his face until now suddenly looks very surprised
your mother came to us as a cook
and you were born about three months afterwards
and she was such a sweet woman and such a good cook we didnt want to lose her
so brother married her
your real father was a cook too
he was a chef on a tramp steamer
you mean im not really a brewster
he almost falls backward
both sisters catch him up
dont feel so badly about it
im sure it wont make any difference to elaine
he yells several whooping cries and then kisses them both very affectionately
then he rushes to the window jumps into the open window seat opens the drapes and yells outside
where are you
can you hear me
im not really a brewster
im the son of a sea cook
we hear elaine screaming
elaine comes running upstairs from the cellar
i saw them
mortimer its true
rooney and saunders come out of the kitchen
there are thirteen bodies down there
mortimer tries to make her shut up and succeeds only by kissing her very passionately on the mouth
mumbles through mortimers mouth but i saw them whats all this screaming about
elaine tries to put a few words but mortimer keeps on kissing her
mumbles through mortimers mouth but i saw them
its way past her bedtime
with his mouth still pressed on her he lifts her and carries her across the room to the front door
he opens the door and rushes outside
the two sisters come to the door waving goodbyes to him
what is all this
theyre going on their honeymoon
well theyre off to a flying start
the two sisters burst laughing and turn to the door
mortimer comes out of the house still carrying elaine with his mouth pressed on her
ohara and the cab driver who were chatting together jump up and look at the strange couple
mortimer still carrying elaine moves along the house with the cab driver following him
finishing the story he was telling the cab driver i pull my gun at
i really did see
youll own two cabs
i mean the meter
elaine eventually comes out of her hysteria
she puts her arms around mortimer and talks to him in a very sweet voice
they kiss very tenderly
the cab driver comes closer to the couple and looks at their closed eyes faces
imitating elaines voice oh mortimer
mortimer turns to him
to the cab driver oh were going to niagara falls
call me a cab dear
the cab driver realizes his mistake and checks himself
but mister brewster
no no im not a brewster
im a son of a sea cook
he laughs and lifts a very surprised elaine on his shoulder and runs through the churchyard towards reverend harpers house
the cab driver puts his hands to his face then takes them away and yells im not a cabdriver
im a coffeepot
with one hand on his cap and the other hand extended on his side he mimes a coffeepot
in the background we see mortimer entering the house with elaine still on his shoulder
the cab driver drops his arms and walks back to his taxi
both the words the end and the credits are written in white letters on a cartoon representing a village with a sorceress flying on a broomstick above the village
