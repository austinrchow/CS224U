screenplay by sarah parriott josann mcgibbon the wind rustles the endless field of corn blows over the freshly mown meadow of soybeans and magically sways a copse of trees
its a fall after noon
a sudden pounding of galloping hooves breaks the peace and
a horse and rider burst between the rows of corn into the meadow
they are running for their lives
the rider is a bride a beautiful woman dressed in a disheveled wedding gown its train tattered and flying like a knights banner out behind her
this is maggie carpenter
the horse is frothing and wild eyed like the bride who turns to look behind her in terror
the horses labored breathing mingles with maggies panicked gasps
we see a wedding bouquet fly into a ditch as the horse thunders on
maggie clings to the reins
she looks as though she is running from the devil himself
hey fisher pick up
i have some column ideas i want to bounce off you
listen im thinking of writing about those mind numbing informercials that are always on
ike walks out of his apartment building talking on cell phone
ike contd what do you think
good idea right
boring down to death pointless it sucks
ike yells at a construction worker
ike contd if you guys are here any longer theyre gonna make you sign a lease
your column should be so funny
ike turns and walks down the street talking into cell phone
okay i was also thinking i might write about
he spots a rich lady with tons of diamonds getting out of a limousine talking to a chauffeur
he goes up to her
ike contd excuse me
i was thinking of doing an article on limousines
what would you say to people who never had a chance to drive in a limo
they walk up to her doorman
im sorry i dont know any people like that
ike walks off
they stare at him as he goes
ikes talking on the phone to his friends machine again
into phone fisher
come on i know youre sitting there laughing at me
i want to run an idea past you
ike continues walking now in the full panic of writers block
he pleads into his friends answering machine as he walks
ike contd into phone i just could use someone to toss it back and forth with for a few minutes get the juice flowing help me
i have an hour and twenty seven minutes and fifty two seconds
he walks away from the t shirt table towards the bar
the vendor calls out to him
hey ike when are you going to put me in an article
when your t shirts stop shrinking
ike enters the bar
the woman drops the shirt she was holding and walks off with her children
the t shirt vendor goes back to selling his shirts
ike sits at the bar speaking to an attractive woman nearby a man puts is usa today on the bar and addresses the bartender
i see photos of a lot of dead writers on these walls
got any living ones
i have a story to tell that could win one of them a pulitzer
then with enthusiasm picture this if you will
a small town in maryland a sleepy little village within that a hardware store
the man continues speaking as ike and the woman continue their conversation
so whats in store for us in tomorrows column
i dont know yet
im kind of a last minute man
ideas dont flow until an hour or two before deadline
the woman gets up and begins throwing darts
interrupting this is very interesting
you get your ideas for your column from life
you start up a conversation with a woman in a bar attack her choice of reading material try and get a rise out of her while you contemplate whether or
not shes worth hitting on
no i cant hit on you until i get an idea
she starts throwing darts
no you dont understand
the woman goes to her bar stool gathering her bag and leaves a tip for the bartender
i think i do understand
so my not responding to your baiting me will inspire one of those potential bitter diatribes you love to write about women and all the things we do to drive
taken aback i dont write bitter diatribes about women
she whacks him with a newspaper then shakes his hand
only when the ideas arent flowing huh
well it was very nice to meet you one minute man
the woman leaves the bar
as she exits thats last minute man
then louder and its the quality that counts
you know for a good looking man you strike out a lot
ive seen much worse
the phone rings
te bartender answers it as ike sits back on his bar stool
ike grabs the womans magazine that she left on the bar and starts glancing at it
the man at the bar has heard the whole thing
man contd i said ive seen much worse
ike looks at the man with reservation
the man is george swilling
the brush off
ike gets up and moves to the dart board
he removes the darts
man contd ive witnessed far more treacherous and nefarious exits than that
at least she castigated you in private
not as private as i thought
ike turns slightly giving the man his back
ike contd kevin youve got some napkins
writing or wiping
give me a pen
the bartender gives him cocktail napkins and a pen
ike starts making notes
ike looks up from his writing
the man gets up and starts throwing darts
throwing darts hard ah come on
they deserve it
they love you they hate you theyre hot theyre cold theyre high theyre low
theyre up theyre down
its really fun making this list with you but ive got a column to go write
undeterred but you dont have a really superb idea
well theres a girl from my hometown you could write about
ike moves to the bartender and pays him
to man excuse me we dont need any new ideas
she likes to dump grooms right at the altar
they call her the runaway bride
both ike and bartender turn and stare
she performed the travesty seven or eight times
right at the altar she turns around and runs like hell
ike turns and heads for the door
the man calls after him getting up from his stool without stopping his enthusiastic story
man contd adios
plows down the aisle knocking old ladies out of her way like the running of the bulls at pamplona
and guess what
i give up
she has the next victim all lined up
shes twirling another body on the spit
ike stops in his tracks
he turns back around in spite of himself
beginning his story imagine if you will a small town in maryland
ike sits at his computer cassette player with miles davis plays next to him as he types away reading his handiwork to himself
reading today is a day of profound introspection i have been accused of using this column to direct bitter diatribes at the opposite sex
this uncomfortable accusation has plunged me into at least fifteen minutes of serious reflection from which i have emerged with the conclusion that yes i traffic in female stereotypes
fisher walks through the main office reading the paper
but how can one blame me when every time i step out my front door i meet fresh proof that the female archetypes are alive and well
te mother the virgin the whore the crone theyre elbowing you in the subway stealing your cabs and overwhelming you with perfume in elevators
elaine at her desk reads aloud to herself
but perhaps in fairness to the fairer sex i do need to broaden my horizon and add some new goddesses to the pantheon i would like to nominate for deity
fisher hands a file to elaine
the cheerleader the coed and the man eater the last of which concerns me most today
fisher leaves and we hold a usa today sign
the man comes out of the mens room reading the usa today kevin the bartender stands on the bar reading the same article
reads to be fair the man eater isnt exactly new
in ancient greece this fearsome female was known as erinys the devouring death goddess
in india she is kali who likes to devour her boyfriend shivas entrails while her yoni devour his dot dot dot never mind
in indonesia the bloody jawed man eater is called ragma
te man sits at the bar near to the bartender
you noticed these are all countries without cable
then continues reading
and in hale maryland where she helps run the family hardware store
she is known as miss maggie carpenter mispronounces
aka the runaway bride
workers read the above article
peggy and mrs
pressman exit the parlor and stroll down the street
lowers her paper and reads
and in hale maryland where she helps run the family hardware store
to the women we have to go to maggie
cindy mind the shop
exits salon continues reading
she is known as miss maggie carpenter aka the runaway bride
the older one mrs
pressman listens with a pained expression as the younger one peggy continues to read the column aloud
neither one can believe what theyre reading
reads what is unusual about miss carpenter is that she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them
she has already disemboweled six in a row by leaving them at the altar
i cant ready anymore
takes paper from her reads and her ritual feast continues as she prepares to make a sacrifice out of the seventh fiance
so all bets are on and we hope that this boomerang bride isnt honeymooning with las vegas odds makers because many predict that this girl is out of there before
before the rice hits the ground then holy moly
peggy and mrs
pressman step into a hardware store
peggy and mrs
pressman enter worried
you tell maggie
no you tell her
youre her best friend
holding her newspaper you know its just possible that she hasnt read this yet
maybe she hasnt read the paper
on the counter they see a copy of usa today opened to the article about maggie
pressman contd or not
we follow maggie down the back stairs inside the hale hardware store the prettiest most welcoming shop of its kind anywhere in small town usa
somehow the place ha taken on the spirit of the owners daughter both stop and shop girl radiate brightness charm and possibility
maggie comes down steps with a faucet handle and goes to an elderly customer mr
bright here we go
one antique hot water handle with the hot still on it guaranteed to fit any american standard cast iron tub with a four inch center made between and
in other words i think youre out of the doghouse with mrs
paxton ill put it on your account
maggie rounds the bend another customer earl stands by the paint machine
walking past customer you dont need an air conditioner earl you just need an attic fan theres more in the back
maggie steps behind the front counter of the store and takes the account book out
her voice trails off as she sees the dour expression on the faces of her friends
maggie contd what
peggy nervously mentions the newspaper
delicate so mag youve seen this huh
serious yes ive seen it
and i have to say its the rudest and most offensive
joke anybodys ever played on me
to their amazement maggie starts smiling
maggie contd you guys
how long did this take you
maggie stays amused
maggie contd whered you get this done
laughing you creeps
i should disinvite you
and why did you say seven times
this is four
uh maggie you told us to bachelorette jokes so we didnt
maggie looks at the stricken face of her friends
peggy looks like she is going to cry with sympathy for maggie
maggie is starting to feel uncomfortable
she looks down dubiously at the paper
um you know now would be a good moment to tell me this is fake
no response it wont be funny if you drag it out
no response okay well
i mean i can find out
real newspapers smear
phoney papers dont
she picks up the paper and brushes it against her apron leaving an ink smear
she nearly kneels over
maggie contd sitting bag
peggy and mrs
pressman immediately spring to her side
they give her a bag to breathe in
we see maggie kickboxing in anger
the radio is on
she suddenly stops yanks ikes article off the wall leaves her workout area and goes to her desk
she turns off the radio and begins to type her letter
as maggies voice over continues to read her letter we take in a manhattan busy day
it is big loud and anonymous
contd greeting from the sticks
perhaps you believe that a rural education is focused mainly on hog calling and tractor maintenance rather than reading
why else would you print a piece of fiction about me and call it fact
te camera finds ike striding across a busy street dodging taxies
a woman smacks him with a newspaper
he passes a woman traffic officer then a hot dog stand
he greets and passes a falafel vendor
the camera pans to a usa today truck
contd i suppose mr
graham was too busy thinking us slanderous statements about how i dump men for kicks to bother with something silly like accuracy in reporting
which is understandable because with a man eater like me on the loose who has time to check facts
he passes regular guys who cheer him
contd still we cannibalistic queens can get pretty cranky when we see things in print that hurt our feelings like that we deliberately abandon fiances with malice aforethought
he enters the newspaper building going to ellies office
he walks through the crowded city room
his arrival attracts a lot of attention from his co workers
ike seems a little surprised but hes pleased
contd thats why i was surprised to find mr
grahams editor was a woman
call me a sentimental fool but i sort of hoped we man eater could stick together
ike works his way down the hall to the editors office
chuffa ike greets various workers
he steps up to the editors secretary elaine
she doesnt smile
to elaine ill put in a good word for you
no no dont mention my name in there
you can go in now
ike goes into ellies office
elaine picks up her phone
ellie is that editor
stylish and successful looking shes about ikes age
ellie sits behind a big desk with a scowl on her pretty face
her casual looking husband fisher sits nonchalantly on the arm of the couch
ike enters as ellie reads maggies letter
reading letter anyway im just dropping you big city folk this little note to say that i have thought of a ritual sacrifice that would satisfy my current appetite ike
grahams column on a platter
yours truly maggie carpenter
i have inclosed a list of the gross factual misrepresentations in your article
there are fifteen
ike sits as ellie puts the letter down and takes off her glasses
chuckles as he sits fully
i like her
she has wit
i left four messages
you dont return my calls
i never returned your calls even when we were married
and whats fisher doing here anyway
fisher gets and places a photo of the cat on a bookshelf on his way to the other side of the room
ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support
since when does ellie need moral supp its for you ike
journalism lesson number one
if you fabricate your facts you get fired
ellie pushes usa today lawyers letter across the desk for him to read
ike picks it up and skims the letter
his face is as impassive as stone
lesson number two
never work for your former spouse
thats not nothing to do with it
you cooked this story up and you know it
i didnt cook up a story
i had a source
someone reliable im sure
a booze hound in a bar
in vino veritas
dont knock drunk guys in bars
drunk guys in bars are good
it means theyre not driving
ike gets up and stands near ellie making his point
ike contd besides im a columnist
this is what columnists are supposed to do
this is what you like
we push we stretch we go out on a limo
thats what makes me good
no thats what makes you unemployed
i merely write the stuff
youre the one that serves it up
ike puts down the letter and puts his glasses back into his pocket
i have to draw the line
pushing a piece of paper she sent us this list
our lawyers say its actionable
ellie hands ike maggies list
glances at list i dont know ellie firing me is going to be very tough on you
its going to be hard to get over
there will be therapy bills for you
shrugs i already made an appointment for later today
putting the list down standing see
you want custody of my job
why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel ive served my time
im sorry ike
this is permanent
fisher winces and looks away
ike and ellie look at each other for a sober moment
contd if you go quietly ill get you severance pay
ellie fidgets with her toy rake then ike heads for the door
he laughs a little at the painful truth of her words and walks out
ellie collapses back in her chair
fisher goes to her and rubs her shoulders
ike rides sadly on the back of a forklift gets off and walks out
a train goes by
a modest clapboard house with a porch
a paperboy tosses a paper onto the lawn in front of the house
the front door opens and maggie appears fresh out of bed wearing only a jacket and panties
heedless of being seen this way she scampers out to the sidewalk to pick up her delivered paper usa today
she tears off the plastic bag and rips into it looking for her letter
she finds it
a smile on her face then she scampers back into the house
maggie skips back into her house which she shares with father and grandma
a cozy and eclectic place creatively furnished on a shoe string
she rushes into kitchen where bob kelly fiance is packing cans into a backpack
bob has a pleasant face and a body that is almost shockingly buff
hes wearing a t shirt that reads mountaineers do it against the wall
maggie dances over waving the paper and singing
she canned him she canned him
bob test the weight of the backpack adding dehydrate food
come here mag and try this on
maggie puts the paper on the kitchen counter and starts to read aloud paying no mind to bob who is sticking her arms through the straps of the backpack
listen dear ms
carpenter i apologize to you for this unfortunate matter
ike grahams column will no longer be appearing in this paper
best of luck in you upcoming marriage
bob continues to hold up the weight of the backpack as he straps it onto maggies shoulders
that a girl
you sacked him
checking pack this is the weight of the pack youre going to have to carry in the himalayas
tell me if its too heavy
bob lets go and maggie falls backward disappearing behind the counter and hitting the floor with a thud
bob looks down at her
maggies voice rises from the floor behind the counter
its a little
its a little heavy
help me baby
bob has no answer
he reaches a hand down
he yelps as maggie pulls him down on top of her out of frame
we hear them giggle and kiss
fisher uses the dock for a photo shoot featuring men and women in evening and formal wear from escada for g
fisher is not actually shooting the camera but rather supervising it
fisher claps his hands and calls the models to attention
then he goes onto the stage and sets the models in their positions
fisher contd remember we are putting the fun back into formal
to ike i just say that for the agency guys
i dont even know what that means
now follow me
elevator doors open
ike and fisher exit and walk towards the coffee table
ike i really liked the runaway bride piece and since i do freelance stuff for g
im in a different position now
what are you trying to say to me fish
they stop walking
how would you like to get some
a chance to prove that though your facts werent entirely straight your theory was correct
hiding his hope the real story on miss carpenter
all the gory details
they start walking again
excited the anatomy of the black widow spider of maryland
it wouldnt be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again
enthusiastically this is good
it is a good story fish
they stop at the coffee table and grab something to eat
nods if she runs then its a cover story
confesses okay you were right
i hated my column but i can do this assignment
then youve got it
if you leave tomorrow for the hinterlands youll have plenty of time before her next wedding trot
paid vindication thats what i call justice
paid i dont know
they like the idea but my hands are tied with budget restraints
but ill get my normal fee right
he walks away
you want me to do it on spec
he follows him
we see ike driving down the highway
the car sputters a little as he and fisher continue their conversation in voice over
if needed by the editor
dont say spec like its a dirty word
nobody ever paid shakespeare to write a play
plato never got a book advance
i happen to know from reliable sources that nietzche got expenses and a rental car
we hear fisher laugh
contd im going to make this work fish
im going to do it
ikes car drives into hale passing a billboard reading welcome to hale
ike drives down picturesque main street
he passes hale hardware
sign says at curl
be back soon
a barbershop quartet is singing in front of the only hotel in town
ike pulls up and goes inside
ike has checked into the atlantic hotel
the clerk lee hands him his key
ike asks about room service and the restaurant
an older woman asks him if he plays bridge as he goes up the stairs to his room
ike exits his hotel as the barber shop quartet finishes singing camptown races
he now walks down the charming main artery of the town looking exactly like what he is a cynical new york out of his element on sunny main street usa
kids ride by on bikes streaming balloons behind them
a balloon hits ike on the face
as he crosses the street he mutters into his tape recorder i think im in maryberry
flags hang on all the storefronts and the place sparkles with wholesome attitudes as people greet each other familiarly
ike comes to beauty parlor called curl up and dye
the place is doing business and crowded with women
cindy the manicurist does mrs
maggie sits on the floor next to peggys salon chair fixing the base of a barber chair
she tightens a screw and looks up satisfied
cindys dog is on the floor near maggie
cindy you better sprout
he seems to be enjoying the petroleum distillates
cindy rolls over in her chair picks up her dog and rolls back to her station
back to obedience school
to peggy okay have a seat
peggy sits in the chair
maggie spins her around and around
delighted as she spins youre a goddess
i didnt even need to change this gasket just put in a little hydraulic fluid
when you talk like that i get turned on and it frightens me
ike enters the salon taking off his sunglasses
peggy hops off the chair
im looking for maggie carpenter
there was a sign at the hardware store across the street
are you a reporter
its a little early in the game for ike to be thrown off guard
eyeing his loafers its been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview maggie
about her upcoming wedding and all
no about her getting that asshole from new york fired
ike smiles down at his loafers and shrugs
i am just such a reporter
and you are
not the ice skater
peggy steps aside
ike moves toward cindy and mrs
and who are these lovely ladies
te ladies shake his hand and introduce themselves
maggies unmarried cousin
and you are
turning toward her looking for maggie
maggie someone to see you
maggie looks over from her sitting position on the floor
she gives ike the once over focusing on the shoes
yelling to peggy reporter
ike crouches to see maggie on the floor just as she rises to her feet
ike straightens up
for a moment he is thrown by her beauty and intelligent eyes
i hope you have a different angle
its pretty much all been covered
originality is my speciality
hold on nobody interviews maggie in here unless theyre getting haircut
shes the boss
i just got one
to ike excuse me sir
i have an actual fact for you
steps to mrs
pressman yes mrs
its her fourth time to the altar you know
not seven like they said
tell me something
do you think shes going to make it all the way this time
during the ike mrs
pressman exchange maggie looks at ike
theres something familiar about him
she looks over at peggy and beckons her to a copy of ikes column affixed to a mirror
a goatee and horns have been scrawled on ikes byline picture
hes been devilized
peggy coughs as she recognizes ike in the newspaper clipping
she swallowed her gun
pressman continues her story to ike
im not sure
schullian runs the newsstand hes our local bookie you know hes giving eight to one odds she wont
he says shes so famous now maybe vegas will give odds on her
im going to wait to hear what the pros say
well you let me know
oh i will
maggie indicates column to peggy
she looks over at the part of the shop used to wash and dye hair
theres a sink stool and a cabinet affixed to the wall above sink which holds various shampoos and hair dyes
maggie gets an idea
maggie and peggy step forward toward ike
well instead of a haircut how about a wash
you know get all that city grit out of it
youll answer my questions
maggie nods affirmatively
ike contd removing his jacket fine
you wash ill ask the questions
ike hands peggy his jacket
a mystified peggy leads ike to the sink
while she does this
have a seat
peggy why dont you give him the special treatment that strengthens the follicles
ike sits in the chair near the sink
maggie shakes out a smock and puts it around ike
maggie contd so what do you want to know
ike leans and rests his head on the sink
peggy bends over him and wets his hair
she grabs various hair coloring products
not at all
ive never been more certain in my life
except i am having all kinds of weird dreams
ike pulls the cloth down from over his face
youre going to tell me about them
calming lets just put this back here for the aromatherapy
peggy recovers his face then continues to fuss with the hair coloring products
ike sits with a towel over his head as peggy blow dries the back of his head
his back is to the mirror his body faces maggie
cindy does her own nails as mrs
pressman scratches off lottery tickets
the dog sprout sits in is basket
in another one
pete wearing a hat comes in the front door of the salon
hey pete ill be right with you
ike peeks out from under his towel as maggie continues
im inside the church
everyone i know is there only theyre not really them
theyre like frankenstein monsters but without the bolts coming out of their necks
its all very night of the living dead
and heres the creepiest part i look down at my dress and its red
i mean i have no idea what it means
reds not my color
ike listens intently and stares steadily into her eyes
peggy removes the towel
his hair is divided into equal parts and dyed orange and red
maggie contd so what do you think
ike stares back at her the tickle of suspicion creeping up his spine
i think youd look good in red
no shes talking about your hair
maggie swivels his chair so that ike faces the mirror
ike looks at his brightly colored hair
youre all ready for football season mr
ike stares at his hair in total confusion
with icy calm ike rises from his chair and primps the end of his hair as if giving it the finishing touches
then he sees his defaced newspaper clipping and all becomes clear
he picks up the article and shows it to everyone
ike does a slow burn
yes i think i nailed the personality profile of the women of hale
ike turns and puts the clipping up on the mirror
ike contd to peggy my jacket please
peggy hands him his jacket
ike contd sarcastically thank you
ike moves toward the door
he spots pete
ike contd putting on jacket to pete excuse me pete do you know a place that sells shampoo
third and elm
tell him pete sent you
want my hat
ike smiles at maggie and exits
to peggy he seems crabby
in front of beauty salon maggie follows ike out
if youre looking for elm street its that way
she puts on her sunglasses
he walks the other way
if you came down here in the pursuit of happiness you might as well go back
because you cant make me feel bad
she stops walking and turns to ike
im not here to make you feel bad
im here for vindication
in my heart
you have one
ike walks back to maggie
i feel im right about you
you got me fired lady
you destroyed my reputation and you screwed up my hair
you chew men up spit them out and loved it
and im down here to satisfy myself on that point
passersby stare at ikes hair and giggle
did something happen to make you care about reality
conviction that im onto the truth
youre going to do the same thing to poor bastard number four that you did to the last three
youre going to run again
and im not leaving until you do
youre going to be very disappointed
id love to stay and chat but ive got to get back to work
i still have my job
he stares at her for a beat stung by her words
i have nothing to hide mr
talk to whoever you want
you might actually stumble upon a fact or two
maggie walks away
ike walks a few steps and stops at a kid on a bike
hey kid ill give you ten bucks for your hat
ike puts the hat on and starts to cross the street
an old woman walks by and hits him with a newspaper
ike is stunned
maggie pulls into the driveway in her truck
shes in a fine mood as she walks right in the house
bob walter and maggies grandmother julia sit in the living room
grandma is sewing one of maggies wedding veils
walter drinks wine ike wears a hat
you know when i only see one dog i know ive had too much to drink
te family dog skipper sits near a ceramic dog table
maggie smiles as she walks in the front door and puts down her tool box and bag
youll never guess who came crawling into town with his tail between his legs
maggie enters the parlor to see ike smiling evilly from his seat on the couch
ike contd innocently hello maggie
i just came by to apologize to your family
looks to walter when im wrong im wrong
i pushed a story
i made a mistake
in other words hes only human
an he brought us a bottle of wine
raises the bottle to maggie
they made me put my hat back on
scared the hell out of skipper
youve got to be kidding me
maggie stares at them both
enjoying the moment no no you should have seen skipper
then imitates growling it wasnt that funny
maggie gives him a look that says you are not absolved
she smiles stiffly looking back at ike
she then sits on the arm of bobs chair and puts her arm on his shoulder
so the forces of good and evil have already met
maggie takes the wine bottle from the table next to walter
she snaps a look to bob who follows her
ill help you take into the kitchen
check on the crabs bob
we overhear them murmuring in annoyed tones about the wedding plans as they exit
walter puts down his drink
gee i hope they dont have a fight out there
you dont think theyll call it off
well wedding cake freezes
this we know
you know your daughter seems
ike notices that hes been sewn to the veil
thats okay grandma
grandma cuts the thread and separates the veil from ikes sleeve
ike contd continuing his thought like such a lovely girl
walter points to a portrait painting on the wall
like her mother
seeing the portrait ah beautiful
gets up to admire the portrait i just cant see her leaving multiple grooms in the dust like that
oh yes you can
shes has em all on tape
she has a tape
good natured yeah
lee at the hotel videos wedding
i mean maggie didnt know she was going to make the hundred yard dash
walter gestures to a pile of video cassettes on the bookcase
ike checks on the tapes
dads fishing trip grandmas knee operation grandmas birthday
gotta tell you this about my daughter
my daughter makes real good time even in a long dress and heels
maggie may not be hales longest running joke but she certainly is the fastest
walter cracks up
sarcastically ha ha
close on a tape
it reads maggie i ii iii
ikes interest is more than piqued
ike picks it up
they get up and go to the dining room
the family dog skipper steals food from the table
walter scolds him
walter whacks his crab with his hammer and ike copies him
walter contd emma and i were only blessed with one child not for lacking of trying
this is good dad dont leave anything out
ikes hammer flies out of his hand
he goes to pick it up
so ive come to see it as a bonus really that weve been able to plan and pay for so many weddings
not this one
this ones on me
despite what you think i dont do it on purpose
and i have no intention of doing it again
thats right maggie
just keep your eye on the ball
ike raises his eyebrows in question
bob contd sports psychology
it was my major in college
false modesty im the towns unofficial fitness trainer
big advocate of the mind and body combining for success
you could say or you can quote me im a glass half full king of guy
boasting bobs the head of the p
department at the high school
and he coaches the football team
and hes climbed everest
to maggies satisfaction ike shoots bob a look of begrudging respect
nobody whos been up everest is a total clown
is that right
sticking it to ike without oxygen
my girl likes to brag about me
bob and maggie kiss ike two little love birds
bob contd im taking her trekking on annapurna on our honeymoon
ike is highly amused
sharply we think so
nothing like sharing your nuptial bed with two sherpas and a yak
walter cracks up maggie shoots ike a look
he smiles back
fisher and ellie are exercising
fisher is on a cycle machine
ellie does yoga stretches
ike sits back on the couch puts on his glasses and watches a video taped wedding playing on the tv screen
superimposed titles read brian norris wedding
to fisher into phone you wont believe what im looking at fisher
a videotape of all three train wrecks
two flower girls and peggy enter a crowded church where the groom brian and his best man wait at the altar
now we see maggie come down the aisle then walk past the altar
we see maggie move away another aisle and out of the church
shocked wedding guests rise in horror as she runs from this first wedding
she drags the train boy up the second aisle as she leaves
ike hangs up
he gets up to pick up the remote and then sits back down to watch
the tape fast forwards to the next wedding
now ike is looking at a much more relaxed hipper backyard wedding
it says gill chavez wedding
he hits the fast forward button sometimes slowing down
we see the carpenters backyard
it is gill and maggies wedding day
the yard is crowded with a mixture of hells angels types deadheads and townspeople
the altar is a band platform against the back fence
gill is waiting on the platform with a rock combo playing grateful dead type music
he makes an introductory speech
maggie steps out onto the back porch
shes beautiful in a hippie type wedding ensemble
she walks with her father to a trampoline
we can see her tattoo
she jumps on the trampoline then dives into the crowd
they watch her and body surf her over their heads to the back fence
as she hits the stage she looks at peggy and gill then decides to go
she jumps off the stage and runs up to a passing guy on a dirt bike
she jumps on and turns and waves as she rides away
during the video ike scribbles gill chavez
maggie goes off on dirt bike
the tape fast forwards to the last of maggies fiascoes
he now sees the third wedding
its outdoors in a tree lined area musicians plays
ike laughs as he discovers that maggie approaches the altar on horseback in a simple white dress wearing a crown of flowers
the maid marian look
ike slows the tape
as maggie rides down the aisle suddenly the horse whinnies
maggie has kicked it in the shins
it rears and bolts galloping off with the bride
ike freeze frames the tape on an image of maggie hair blowing
although she is panic stricken her soul seems to shine through in tat single frame
as ike stares at her the smirk fades from his face
he just looks at her allowing himself to see her expression her eyes
he cant help it
she gets to him
ike gets a restless look on his face
he stares closely
the groom is george from the bar
high angle wide shot of a bakery in hale
ike exits a neighboring shop and walks down the block
he pauses in front of the bakery to take a look at maggies truck
as he does a middle aged black woman walks by and whacks him with a newspaper
ike is stunned as she walks off
he turns to a man sitting on a bench
did you see that
close on a group of plastic grooms and brides on a counter top
trout is behind the counter helping maggie with a selection of grooms for her wedding cake
the groom figures are spread out on the counter
all sizes and colors some attached to brides some solo some tuxes some in dinner jackets
this ones very popular but oh youve used this one before
but i like the white dinner jacket
no hes no good
picks up another well go with total traditional
then ike comes up behind her as she discards another groom
but hes got the bobsters eyes
maggie cringes at the sound of ikes voice
ike contd no the bobsters eyes are closer set
she ignores him and continues her search
ike contd to mrs
trout could i have two coffees please
and what is that wonderful smell
seeing the cinnamon rolls ill have two of those delicious looking cinnamon rolls
picking up a miniature bride here maggie
i think this makes the best you
trout steps away to get his order
ike moves to the other side of maggie and picks up the bride and groom figure
excuse me isnt that cute
he makes the bride figure repeatedly knock the groom figure in the head and run away screaming
ike contd bam bam bam bam bam
oh help me
thats her all right
trout just about bursts a gut laughing
maggie takes the bride from ike coldly
you must be that mr
ike turns and goes to her
yes i am
and who are you
as he pays oh betty
i take it youre going to be making the wedding cake and they say youre throwing interrupting the luau for maggie
she starts picking lint off his sleeve and buttons his cuff
all smiles for mrs
trout grandma made me the cutest outfit
i cant wait to show it to you
cynical delight a pre wedding luau
my husband and i love luaus
itll be fun
trout turns and grabs ikes bag containing two coffees
fun isnt the word
maggie understands his answer a little better
trout hands ike his items and he pays
if youre still in town you should stop by
no im sure he doesnt
trout actually i would love to come
taps her service bell thank you
thank you so much
maggie steps over carrying her bride and groom figure choices
exasperated is that what youre going to do now
follow me around everywhere i go
ike smiles at maggie enigmatically as he picks up his order and heads for the door
he starts to leave with his bag
trout stops him
handing him the other bag your two cinnamon rolls
hes not a nice person
maggie hands mrs
trout her bride and broom figures
maggie looks at mrs
trout suddenly nervous
she dashes out
trout imitates ike bamming the bride and groom laughing
various high school sports teams practice
maggie strides across the football field a scowl on her face
a few high school football players job past maggie doing laps
a boy kendall calls out to her affectionately as she passes
one of them dennis slows his pace to run alongside maggie
playful maggie dont marry coach
i love you
youre jail bait dennis
run your laps
dennis runs on as maggie continues toward her goal bob and ike standing together on the other side of the field
theyre both standing on the blocking sled
wave after wave of varsity football players ram into the sled and drive it across the field with both ike and bob on top of it
ike is munching on one of the cinnamon rolls as bob pushes the kids
from your hips get low get low get low
ike smiles broadly atop of the sled as he sees maggie approaching looking mighty peeved
he nudges bob and points to maggie
bob lights up at the sight of her
bob contd good job gentlemen
the football players move away from the sled
bob moves to maggie leaves ike alone
bob contd to maggie hey honey
bob kisses and embraces maggie
she doesnt see ike immediately then indicating ike what is he up to now
ike just came by to check out the team
and talk about you
ike grins and shows maggie the notes in his pocket
bob are you making friends with this man
im just bragging about how great you are
im the luckiest man alive
bob grabs maggie around the waist and smooches her adoringly
maggie scowls at ike
he nods all charm
well ive got to get moving lot of work to do today
ill see you two love birds later
bob calls after him
see you at the wedding
you bet ya coach
maggie is aghast
she stares at bob
ike joins in behind a line of peppy cheerleaders
at the wedding
you invite him
bob dont you realize hes writing another article about me
sure i do
but the bet defense is a good offense right
youre not going to let your opponent throw you off your game
you dont understand this guy
let him come to the wedding
youre not running right
irritably im not running
so if youre not running and ike graham is there to see it then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending right
all were doing is turning lemon into lemonade
ive got news for you
no amount of sugar and water is going to turn like graham into something you want to take on a picnic
bob gives maggie a big hug
wheres that homemade sunshine
bob blows his whistle then puts maggie on the football sled
bob contd i want you boys to take my princess on the ride of her life
honey tell em where you parked your car
maggie screams as the boys push her down the football field
maggie kneels hands folded reverently
the booths grate opens before her
bless me father for i have sinned
my last confession was
she tries to recall
maggie contd anyway i have sort of a technical question here
ive been having bad thoughts
i mean really bad thoughts of an impure nature
no like im having a problem with that whole turn the other cheek concept
i want revenge
i want to destroy this guys life career everything
on the sin scale how big is that
i mean can i hail mary my way out of it
child any sin in ones heart is
impatient the names maggie
it wasnt this side of ten years ago that you had your tongue down my throat
so dont call me child brian
it annoys me
now dont get upset
brian closes the confessional window and exits still inside the booth brian open up
dont ignore me
brian leans into her confessional
she steps out to join him
youre not even catholic maggie you really shouldnt come to confession
hes a nice looking and gentle man
they regard each other for a beat
im just so stressed out about that slime ball reporter being in town
i jus had to come warn you he might show up here and start asking you all kinds of ridiculous questions
brian moves away
maggie follows and sits in a nearby pew
actually he only asked me one ridiculous question
the rest werent so bad
sliding along the pew what
you talked to him
did you tell him we dated before you were a priest
yes yes im sure i only did you good maggie
what did he ask
a woman mrs
murphy rushes in
father am i too late
it wont take long
jus two venials
the woman goes into the confessional booth to wait
only respectful things
what did we have in common back then
what kind of music did you like
did you ruin my life when you left me standing at the altar
and what did you say
how could i be angry at you when clearly what has happened to me is as god intended
relieved good one
it happens to be how i feel
brian sits next to maggie
im sorry i mean im
sighs brian ive got to go
the mans a lunatic but i know exactly where hes going next
god bless you maggie
she turns to rush out then stops herself
oh wait my purse
she moves to the confessional knocks then speaks to mrs
maggie contd excuse me sorry forgot my purse
maggie closes the booth curtain and turns to brian
maggie contd wait what was the ridiculous question he asked
brian smiles mischievously
he wanted to know how you used to like your eggs
like after all those years you would remem she starts to go then stops in her tracks as she hears interrupting scrambled with salt pepper and dill
same as me
maggie looks at brian
suddenly she remembers too
tenderly im really sorry that i hurt you brian
im happy here where im supposed to be
but if you ever become a catholic may i ask you a favor maggie
could your confess to father patrick from now on
and she scampers out
brian goes back into the confessional
maggie drives up to an old brick firehouse that is now an auto garage
the faded sign reads gills garage
maggie rushes inside and looks around
no one is in sight
several cars including a yellow jeep like car up on a hydraulic lift are in the funky garage
a crash coming from the nearby back room we hear loud muttering in spanish then out stumbles gill chavez wearing a grease stained grateful dead tie dyed t shirt
he grins triumphantly worshipfully cradling a cassette tape in his hands
hey i found it
maggie regards her former fiance with patient warmth
gill looks up and gives maggie a fond hazy smile
hey look the tape from the radio city music hall concert remember that night i as trying to get jerry to let me sit in on ripple
he pulls out the cassette from its case
the tape is dangling from the cassette
gill contd disappointed oh ill play it for you
gill picks up an electric guitar and starts to play
shouts over the music listen gill theres this reporter whos ben making my life a living hell if he comes by here dont talk to him
and whatever yo do
crosses to gill dont show him that picture of me at the concert in san francisco suddenly a loud chuckling emanates from the car overhead
maggie contd what was that
maggie stops gill from playing
she shoots her ex an angry glare and moves a lever on the shop wall
with a hum the car descends
we went to san francisco twice
remember one time we had a flat tire
as the hydraulic lift slows the car is lowered revealing ike sitting in the drivers seat
he has been enjoying the photograph hes holding
feigning shock imagine
maggie carpenter topless in a public arena
checks photo again and i see there was a chill in the air
maggie swipes for the photo but ike is faster at pulling it away
give me that
but the most interesting thing here is that i dont see the rose tattoo that ive heard about on your back
gill takes off his guitar and sets it down
ike bet me fifty bucks you dont still have it mags
i said youre on man
maggie loved that thing
and i could really use fifty bucks
maggie is conspicuously silent
gill contd looking worried mags
im not gonna show you guys anything
i am a soon to be married woman
now give me that photograph
sure i would love to give this to you
just give us one quick gander at that rose and ill gladly hand it over
she tries to grab the photo again
ike pulls it away
maggie quickly turns around and pulls down the back of her shirt revealing the top of her back and a pristine expanse of skin
maggie contd turning back around satisfied
gill is still trying to grasp the meaning of this
you got it removed
gill ill go ya double or nothing if was a stick on
admitting im really really afraid of needles
it doesnt make me a bad person
maggie looks at him with rage
gill dramatically pulls down the front of his t shirt
there it is on gills chest the rose tattoo
maggie sighs pained
gill shows it to ike
ike looks at the tattoo
he shakes his head at maggie
sincerely look look man
i think the man is heartbroken
he is not
maggie moves the lever on the wall again sending ike back up to the ceiling in the car
she grabs the photo from ike and exits
i think i am
gill grabs his guitar and sits
gill contd hey ike what would jerry do
the hydraulic lift stops moving
ike leans out
jerry would play his heart out
ike sings and taps along in tempo on the side of the car as gill sings and plays ripple
as maggie drives into town with peggy they see ike on porch with sheriff police chief and mail man all playing instruments as a blues band
ike is not bad on slide guitar
they all like ike
maggie chuffas with peggy and moves on
the slow loopy pitch of a softball
a bat connects
a big wholesome man cory runs for first base
he just beats out the throw
bob acting as umpire yells safe
happy cory turns to the stands and waves
maggie and peggy cheering loudly
peggy tries to whoop harder than maggie but that would be tough
from firs base cory waves back to them
the two women sit back down and maggie takes back up with their conversation
maggie is still al steamed up
okay hes on base
can we talk about my life now
ikes going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal that i was never serious about gill blah blah
hes totally out to get me
for what reason
some personal satisfaction
thats what he says but if he thinks that i dont realize hes writing another article then hes an idiot
its probably because you got him fired
sarcastic ya think
not that he doesnt deserve to get fired
corys going for second
cory as he runs for second base and with a slide beats the throw for the force out
the women jump and cheer maggie again the most boisterous
dennis recognizes ike as he walks up
dennis tells ike that he is going to marry maggie some day and shows ike where maggie is sitting
maggie spots ike as they sit back down
there he is
snoop doggy dogg
hes talking to our little dennis
dennis will turn into one of those sources say things
he looks better with that stuff out of his hair
hes an attractive man
ike finds maggie in the crowd and leaves dennis
id say youve been in the sun too long
you handle him okay
i could use five minutes off from that creep
before peggy can protest maggie climbs down off the bleachers and goes and stands near the dugout near the rest of corys team
okay thats fine
i can do that
ike comes up to peggy
hello peggy phleming not the ice skater
ike indicates the seat next to peggy
protesting weakly thats maggies seat
ike sits down comfortably
and this is maggies beer
he starts drinking it
on the field cory is getting ready to steal third
ike contd that your husband out there
cory phleming a local radio announcer
have you listened to his morning show wake up with ballplayer
i had a phlemless morning
i hear hes a pretty good ballplayer
this game is pretty important to him
he made all stars in high school you know
that must have made you proud
peggy takes a small sip off her soda
he was going with maggie back then
quickly he was never one of her
i mean they were never going to get
they just dated for a while
cory dives in for third and makes it
the crowd goes wild
peggy yells and jumps in
peggy contd good job honey
but maggies whoop sails out above it all
but not at peggy
he directs his delight at maggie who jumps up and down by the dugout
ike looks between cory maggie and finally peggy
peggy jerks her waving hand back down to her side and sits down
ike pretends not to have noticed
the two watch as maggie and cory smile at each other
its nice that theyre still friends
looking at maggie and cory oh sure
that was a long time ago
see shes not a man hater at all
shes very supportive of men
next batter hits one to deep left field and it lands in the grave yard
cory scores greeted by maggie
ike and peggy watch as cory and maggie belly bump and high five each other in celebration of corys play
no looks at peggy
ike keeps an empathetic silence seeing that peggy is truly hurt
peggy contd ill be back in a second
suddenly peggy stands pushes past him and runs down the steps
maggie looks up just in time to catch peggys exit
ike pulls his tape recorder out of his pocket and starts speaking into it
maggie shoots ike an accusing look walks up to him in the bleachers and sits next to him
youve been here for three minutes
what did you do to her
you can turn that finger around
ike does an on the button imitation of maggie jumping excitedly at cory
now maggie sees what hes getting at
defensive you misinterpret everything
weve all been friends our whole lives
but thats the types of relationship you wouldnt understand
obviously im not the only one who doesnt understand it
the uss maggie leaves quite a wake
ike walks away
alone maggie tries to seem enthused
see i cheer good
what is he a cheer critic
sitting in front of inn hale bar we see the bartender pantomiming holding the reins of a wildly galloping horse
weve seen something like this before
maggies wild ride away from her last wedding
ike laughs with bartender just as maggie drives by the bar and sees this
to herself this guy never stops
maggie walks up to the front desk of the hotel where lee is sleeping with his feet up
she knocks his feet off the counter
lee hey wake up
give me the key to the reporters room
i want to snoop around
handing her the key okay
dont take anything big
maggie moves up the stairs towards ikes room
maggie walks towards ikes room checks that no one sees her and enters
maggie lets herself in the modest room and turns on the lights on
she spots on audio cassette on the desk near the door
she holds the cassette up to the light to read the hand written label
it says miles davis on it
she pockets the tape
she walks to the living room
ike has placed post its on a framed picture using the frame as a bulletin board
post it notes lay out the information he has gathered under headings and subheadings
parents mother deceased subheaded by walter and there is one for brian gill and bob
maggie smiles and shakes her head
she rips one post it down and reads it to herself
reads how does she get all these guys to propose
shes not that beautiful
snorts bite me paper boy
she begins ripping many of other post it off the picture frame
maggie contd as she takes post its rude
shes ripping them down fast and furious then shoves them in her shoulder bag
ike comes down hallway as harvey puts his shoes out to be shined
maggie looking around discovers the wedding video on the coffee table and grabs that too
maggie contd thief
the sound of a key in the door makes maggie jump
she flees to the bathroom and shuts and locks the door
just as ike enters he sniffs and looks around the room instantly knowing something is up
he sees all his notes gone and a glimpse of maggie as she closes the bathroom door
ike is steaming
a bump sounds from the bathroom
he goes over to the door and tries the handle
he starts to pound on the door
all right i know youre in there
you steal my research
youre messing with the first amendment now
you got no place to go
maggie is already trying to open the first bathroom window
she climbs over the bathtub opens that window and starts to climb out
i want to have a very serious discussion with you as to why youre such a pain in the ass
we hear ike slamming his body against the bathroom door
as ike breaks in he runs to the window and yells after her
ike contd thats breaking and entering
ill call the sheriff
you do that
and remind him hes bringing the wine to the luau
she disappears around the ledge of the building and runs off
ikes neighbor harvey sits reading near his window
close on a cassette player
we see the familiar handwritten label miles davis
kind of blue plays as maggie listens in a chair looking shell shocked surrounded by the post its she stole from ikes room
we see as she reads them father two fisted drinker peggy best friend but peggy doesnt totally trust maggie bob doesnt love him
overwhelmed she finishes reading the last note leans back puts her feet up on the table deep in the mood of the melancholy music
the camera moves on the last note on the floor next to her chair
it reads shows no remorse
its early morning
pressman hands peggy a cup of coffee to go
peggy walks to the beauty parlor unlocks the front door and goes in
peggy enters and starts about her opening duties
she turns on the lights and turns and sees her friend maggie
do you think i flirt with cory
peggy stops in her track
maggie is sitting curled up in a salon chair
she looks like she hasnt slept
good morning to you too
you look good
do you think i flirt with cory
maggie looks miserable
i dont mean it
peggy moves to the salon mirror near maggie with her cup of coffee
i think sometimes you just sort of spaz out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves
on anything male that moves
as opposed to anything male that doesnt move
peggy pours her coffee out of its styrofoam cup into a ceramic mug
like certain kinds of coral
peggy sits in the salon chair next to maggie
im going to kill myself
because you think im all like
hey man check me out
friendly no i dont think youre like im charming and mysterious in a way that even i dont understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a
big man like you
very hard to compete with
especially to us married women who have lost our mystery
but you havent lost your mystery
youre very mysterious
weird and mysterious are two different things
but im weird
quirky and weird are two different things
peggy theres distinct possibility that i might be profoundly and irreversibly screwed up
despite that i love you and i can promise that i will no longer flirt with cory and i beg your forgiveness
maggie looks ready to cry
im not worried about you and cory or cory and me or even that youre irreversibly screwed up
but maggie youve been like this since we were kids
and i think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts peoples feelings maybe its time to move on with your life and commit to someone of
your own like bob if hes the one
i think youre right
then is there anything i can do to make it up to you
something that brings warmth to my heart
pause duckbill platypus
its only funny at camp birchwood at three in the morning at a tick hunt
its not anymore
maggie makes her funny face
peggy doesnt laugh
its not funny now
maybe we both grew up
will you fix my hair
maggie exits her house gets on her bike and rides off towards town
ike is still in bed
he slowly blinks awake stretches and is about to throw off the covers when maggies voice breaks the silence
hold on to those covers i didnt come here to see ike junior
maggie smiles cheerfully at ike from the foot of the bed
he narrows his eyes at her
i take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers
deadpan how do i do it
im not that beautiful
ike notices maggie is holding two coffees
maggie hands it to him
your notes made interesting bedtime reading if you like trashy fiction
your observations are distorted ungrounded an incomplete
you must be very proud
im not a boastful man
whats your point
ike puts a shirt on as maggie speaks
my point is that one again youre getting it all wrong
that wont improve your reputation any and its not very flattering to me either
so im going to give you a chance to write the truth
maggie turns away from him as he dresses
ive decided to cooperate and let you interview me
beat for a thousand bucks
ike clears his throat as he stands putting his pants on
maggie contd i want a big wedding and a killer dress and for a grand i will answer all your questions and let you follow me around
ike takes his coffee with him as he picks up his glasses puts them on and crosses to the window
my magazine doesnt pay because for stories
its not what you call ethical
oh but making up the facts as you go along is ethical
actually i meant you
you probably got severance or expenses or both
ill take your check
no credit cards
to maggie youve seen the post its
ive already got more juicy material than i need
why should i pay you dollar one
because i think youre writing on spec and with a first person interview you might actually sell that thing
ike knows shes right
scowling he writes out the check and hands it to her
maggie looks at it and smile sweetly
ike jogs alongside of maggie on her bike
maggie parks her bike and they go inside her door to the house
maggie leads ike upstairs to her workroom
pardon the mess
i havent cleaned since the fifth grade
insert on a cappuccino machine
we pull back and see maggie and ike standing at her work table
an automatic cappuccino maker stands on the table
its base is made from a used paint mixing machine
it looks very shiny and futuristic
maggies logo mag is on the side
the machine shakes as it steams the cappuccino
ike notices another homemade machine on the table
ike contd whats this over here
its a birthday present for my cousin
put your finger in
cindy the manicurist
he puts his finger in the wrong hole of the machine
no the other one
he puts his finger in the correct hole
she turns it on
the brushes rotate
laughing this is wonderful
you reconfigure all these industrial parts and you do something amazing with it
he looks around and spots some gadgets and lamps on another table
he walks to them
ike contd amazing
found industrial stuff
he picks up one of the many logos on the counter
each boasts a mag logo
ike contd is this your preferred logo
i think so
i like it
this whole thing is pretty incredible
studying a lamp i think you could probably sell this lamp idea in new york
you afraid to try
stares at him no im not afraid
well im impressed
sitting i didnt expect pink and lacy but this isnt exactly a womans room
what an incredible chauvinistic observation
maggies showing ike engagement rings
he took me ut canoeing on the lake and gave me the ring in a velvet box
maggie hits him
maggie contd defensive it was classic
maggie hands ike another ring
this one is in the shape of a grateful dead rose
maggie contd gill
he proposed at the tie dye t shirt stand at a dead concert
it was very sweet until he hallucinated that the drum set was a blood sucking space alien
always a mood killer
maggie hands ike a third ring
its in the shape of a butterfly and studded with multi color gems
maggie contd george
he proposed at a butterfly farm in st
the ring was inside a cocoon
grimacing its a little silence of the lambs for me
i cant believe you waited for the wedding to run
hes an entomologist
i thought it was very unique
now maggie shows ike the ring on her hand
its a gold with a diamond set into the number
maggie contd and here we are at bob
he proposed during the seventh inning stretch
ike touches her hand to examine the ring more closely
her surprise at his touch shows on her face as she finishes her sentence
maggie contd at an orioles game
she takes her hand down
ike steps away
dont tell me
the scoreboard lit up with mary me maggie
ike picks up his cup of cappuccino and moves behind the couch
it was one of the most wonderful moments of my life
cal ripken even applauded
stopping highly suspect
what do you mean
it was incredibly romantic
maybe its just me but if you got to dress it up it doesnt ring true
ike moves back to the couch
ike contd i think the most anybody can honestly say is look
sits on the arm of the couch i guarantee that well have tough times
i guarantee that at some point one or both of us will want to get out of this thing
but i also guarantee that if i dont ask you to be mine ill regret it for the rest of my life
because i know in my heart youre the only one for me maggie stares at ike for a beat
his words have taken a little bit of her breath away
i like it
she moves from the fireplace to a chair and sits
maggie contd id like it better on a scoreboard
lightly is that how you proposed when you asked your wife to marry you
ike is taken aback
maggie contd dont look so surprised youve got divorce written all over you
im a work in progress
is that what you said to her
i think i said something eloquent like so uh maybe we should ya know
what do you think
now thats romantic
a proposal like that and you didnt find eternal bliss
what went wrong
ike takes a swallow of cappuccino
i dont know
you dont know
maybe you should ask her some time
ever thought of that
ike is restless
he stands up
call me crazy but i believe that check i gave you entitles me to ask the questions for a while
ike puts down his cup of coffee gets his tape recorder and sits close to maggie
thinks a beat actually
maggie move to tv
she picks up ikes stolen post it notes and her wedding video on top of the tv and goes to the front door
maggie contd ill just need one more day to make sure your check clears
ike and maggie drive in maggies truck
they pull up in front of a bridal shop
a spectacular dress fills the small window
its beautiful romantic sexy
maggie and ike can be seen in the reflection
even with everything thats happened ive still never been married and i still deserve a beautiful dress
maggie gives ike a smile that lights up the sky
they go inside
the place is fairly large and prosperous probably the place to go in the tri county area
a little flower girl is being fitted on the pedestal in the middle of the room
a saleswoman polly has taken the flower girl under her wing
they are both under the expert eyes of a stern looking woman mrs
whittenmeyer the shop owner
also the girls mother is there watching
to the mother shell be the prettiest little flower girl in your daughters wedding
the flower girl sees maggie and runs and hides behind polly
youll have to excuse her maggie
some of the children are afraid of you since you dragged that little boy up the aisle
i didnt drag
then to the girl he tripped on his shoelaces
whittenmeyer comes forward to greet maggie
youve come for your dress
ill get it from the back
maggie leads her to the front window
happily actually i would like to get this dress
she points to the dress
she smiles back to mrs
whittenmeyer expecting her to share her joy
to polly polly take leslie into change
then to maggie but the one you have on hold is lovely
but ive changed my mind
its one thousand dollars
maggie is keenly aware of ike listening in
i have one thousand dollars
firmly the other one is only three hundred dollars
maggie lowers her voice hoping to lessen the humiliation of the moment
is this dress for sale
it just seems like an awful lot of money to spend on one of your dresses maggie
you only wear them for about ten minutes
ike watches with regret as maggies child like enthusiasm drains away her happy mood crushed by the tactless assault of the shop owner
hes starting to see that its no always easy being maggie
theres a tremor in her voice
yeah thats a good point
then sitting the other dress is nice
ike calls out to mrs
may i talk to you for a second
she walks over to him
ike contd i dont know much about this kind of thing
im from out of town
youre a salesperson right
youre here to sell wedding dresses
ive been here for thirty years
because miss carpenter is here to buy one
but not just any one
she wants that one
its a thousand dollars
ike goes over and takes the mannequin out of the window
whittenmeyer catches the wig as he puts the mannequin under his arm
ike contd look aunt bea were buying this beautiful dress and anything else she wants or im coming back here with a squirt gun filled with india ink
whittenmeyer wilts under ikes fierce gaze
she turns to maggie
will he really do that
maggie gives her a look
whittenmeyer contd to maggie well why dont you pick out some accessories while i get this ready dear
polly will you come help me please
polly comes to help carry the mannequin away
whispering to mrs
whittenmeyer its a thousand dollars
the man has ink
maggie looks gratefully at ike
tough to spend money in this town
ike sits as he hears maggies voice behind him
what do you think
ike turns around
maggie is standing on the pedestal wearing the dress and looking unbelievably gorgeous
she is overwhelming to behold and ike has to struggle to keep his face under control
stammering you look
you look fine
the newspapers upside down
thats better than fine
bob will be very happy
then the moment between them is broken as she suddenly remembers something and grabs the veil off her head
i almost forgot
i have to meet bob
this is a great place a major hub of social life in hale
the food is greasy and good mrs
pressman is the waitress and the crowd the essence of what is wonderful about a small town
bob maggie and ike sit on the counter
pressman chuffs about the luau then moves around the corner
pressman i think were ready to order
were out the special because somebody
indicates cook with head didnt order enough sausage
let me have the garden omelette
egg whites only
ike looks at maggie
hed bet a thousand bucks on what shed say next
ill have the same
clears his throat of course
what was that
i cant order my eggs without sarcasm
neutral corners you two
youre on the same team now
any more fighting and its fifteen minutes in the penalty box
gently to ike maggies the nicest person youll ever meet
but shes always focusing out there
shes got to start focusing more in here
taps his chest thats why shes had some whatever you want to call it problems in the past
to maggie thats what were working on focus
focus on maggie
focus on bob
as bob has been talking ike has been watching maggies face
the joy seems to have drained out of her
to ike i lead maggie through a visualization exercise
all the sports shrinks use this head stuff
visualize the end zone if you catch my drift
bob takes out a notepad and hands it to maggie
bob contd heres todays mantra its an open field to big bob
when you get to the altar will you spike the bouquet
you know theres no
before maggie can finish ike intercepts her
well im off
a reporters work is never done
heading to the door mrs
pressman thank you
id like to explain about the weddings
there are reasons why they didnt come off
three weddings no i dos
you cant believe how much cake we were left with
i should weigh three hundred pounds
i dont think her father minded spending so much money on booze that nobody drank
we hear grandma as through the hotel doors we see maggie exit the diner
she gets a bag from inside the cab of her truck and comes inside the hotel where she finds ike talking to grandma who is having tea with her friend
gram here was going to give me the skinny on why you run from marital bliss
right cover your ears netta
its not that shes afraid of the wedding shes afraid of the wedding night
innocent girls are terrified of the one eyed snake
getting into it why when i was a virgin bride i took a knitting needle with me into the bed
actually grandma i charmed the one eyed snake awhile ago
oh yeah i forgot
ill tell you one thing your grandpa didnt forget that wedding night
no netta you can take your hands off your ears netta
your teas getting cold
can you excuse us a minute
then to ike may i have a word with you please
maggie moves toward door
he steps over to maggie in the doorway
i found this and didnt know if it was something interesting
maggie hands ike a year old lp miles davis kind of blue
excited oh my god its miles davis
this is king of blue
this is the original recording
hard to find in good condition
where did you find this
casual it was in the attic
it was jus sitting there gathering dust
hang onto it
you take it
she steps outside leaving ike with the record
figuring out what kind of music i like and then finding me a rare album
youre not trying to soften me up are you
no im cleaning an attic
i wouldnt attempt the impossible
she turns and walks back to the diner where mrs
pressman is outside watering plants
ike looks after maggie and then back down at the record in his hand
somehow it makes him sad
ike drives through hale gobbling french fries from the fast food bag in his lap
ike passes the inn hale bar same dump of a tavern he talked to bartender at
angle on maggies car parked a few cars down
he pulls over and parks
he gets out and speaks into his tape recorder
ike approaches the window of the bar
theres a drunk man and a dog sitting outside
inside we see two figures from the back arms around each other
one is definitely maggie
the other is definitely not bob
as maggie helps the man get up we see that its walter maggies father dead drunk
belligerently i havent had any fun since you got your drivers license
they stumble and lurch exiting the bar toward maggies car
im not exactly having fun either
to dog good boy port hole
his name is skipper dad
i changed it
then to drunk see you later mr
then to maggie that guy has a problem
maggie you can run everyones life but your own
maggies having trouble keeping him steady as she opens the car door
ike is there in a flash to help her pull walter into the car
walter contd good daughters let their fathers pass out
walter passes out on the front seat
without difficulty ike
please dont write anything about this no
forget about it
dont even think about it
maggie looks at him with real gratitude
she swings the car door shut
watch your leg dad
then to ike im so tired of this
why dont you let him sleep it off in the trunk
ill take you for a ride
then well come back for him
to drunk on bench keep an eye on him
im too loaded
i was talking to the dog
turning to maggie all right
maggie thinks about this for a moment
she takes a deep breath
ill just grab my jacket
establishing of ikes car driving
maggie and ike ride along
my dad managed a business and two mistresses
he wanted me to be a novelist
maggie nods ike contd my mother wanted me to become a musician
but at least im a journalist and we all know journalism is literature in a hurry
ike and maggie stare forward
both seem in melancholy moods
theyre beginning to sense theyre in trouble here
suddenly the car falters and jerks
it shows to a stop on the shoulder of the road
the car backfires and smokes
ike and maggie sit in the steaming car for a moment
your filters clogged
this takes unleaded
can you fix it
first i have to find some tools
i need a half and a nine six tenth
removing his glasses of what
in amazement wrenches
my dads gonna love that one
maggie slams the food closed
kind of isolated
its kind of nice
an uncomfortable silent pause
ike breaks the moment
theres one thing we new yorkers know how to do is hail a cab
if theres no cab we walk
ike stares off down the road
maggie indicates a building in the distance then turns off the car lights
i can get some tools over there
and save the battery
theres one thing we country girls know how to do is cut across a field
maggie points diagonally across the field to where a gas station sign glows and the lights from the outer house twinkle
he smiles and follows her into the field
maggie contd be careful of snakes
are you serious
i dont like snakes
ive never even seen a snake
he steps carefully into the field then hops gingerly toward maggie
maggie leads ike through a cornfield
do you think theres only one right person for everybody
ike chooses his words carefully
but i think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness
attraction is very misleading
and if its mutual its well terribly distracting
yes it is
and it doesnt mean anything
ike nods as they come to a wooden fence
she puts her hand on his shoulder
ike puts his hands around her waits to give her a boost over the top
we see the flicker of misunderstanding cross maggies face at the initial contact
neither of them moves forward or back but the electricity is obvious
angle on ike
his conflicted feelings are apparent
with difficulty maggie straightens up and they both quickly remove their hands
maggie contd lightly i suddenly forgot how to climb a fence
they look at each other for a moment then breaking the moment jokingly tools
she climbs over the fence on her own and ike follows
they see an old guy lionel whittling on a porch
maggie contd lionel can i borrow some tools
yeah we need a half and nine sixteenths
gonna bust out of another wedding
youre sure well known around here
ike sits on his bed on the phone working and eating his breakfast
hes watching maggies wedding tape again
fisher is cooking an elaborate breakfast
ellie rushes around getting ready for work
he is on the phone to ike
into phone yes well my theory was that she may be running because she gets attention
negative attention is attention
like when women whack you on the street because of your column thats negative attention
this is about her negative attention not mine
did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet
into phone no im paying for the dress
do you think shes still gonna run
i dont know
ellie enters the kitchen hears the question and shakes her head to herself
if only these boys would give it up
he is finding it very hard to gloat
fisher is annoying him
into phone look ill be in there later today
ill come by and tell you all about it
youre coming here
into phone yeah
then come for dinner
into phone okay well order out
order out like a philistine when you got the galloping gourmet here
ike hangs up and watches more of the george swilling wedding video
the bar from the opening scene
george swilling the same man ike talked to before is sitting on a stool nursing his drink
he looks better
george looks up and recognizes ike who takes the bar stool next to him
get this man a kamikaze
splendid dissection of maggie carpenter very professional job
ike sits and leans over to george
whispers you could have told me you were fiance number three
and end up in the papers
ive been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime thank you
im sorry she got you canned
shes a cacophony of contradictions
well im writing another article on the cacophony
ah cant stay away from her can you
like a moth to a flame
guess youd know about that
youre an entomologist right
taking a sip of his drink not bad
i was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when maggie met me
sarcastic neuter a locust feed the world
not the world
just africa and china
ike wipes the smirk off his face
like maggies other men this guy has a worthy accomplishment under his belt
george contd you know maggie was the only girl i ever met who would hold my tarantula
on the first date
ike contd so tell me george why do you think she ran
same as you said
what did you call her
a man eater a devouring death goddess
i dont think thats why she ran
why do you think she ran
ike sips his drink before answering
i dont know
im working on it
i was on the wrong track
and you defending her
i call it like i see it
im a journalist
im a truth teller
unbelievable she got to you
join the club
passing him his drink here you need this more than me
george heads out
protecting taking his tape recorder out of his pocket im writing an article im getting paid to do this its going to be a cover story its going to be
published the facts will be read someday
as george pauses in the doorway ike holds up his tape recorder
ike contd what kind of eggs did she like
poached just like me
ike walks down a street toward ellie and fisher
ellie is on the phone as fisher enters with beer
ike sits at the piano
sarcastically overpriced nice apartment and chinese takeout
thats new york living
into phone just call me when you have it
hangs up then to fisher ike how is the story coming
is she a man eater
or a vegetarian
or does she pick ngbs nice guys but
nice guys but im cheap
nice guys but he lives with his mom
nice guys but he just out of prison
theyre interesting guys
each one of these guys has something going for him
i mean ones been up everest
anothers become a priest
ones a pretty good guitar player
and this guy today tried to end world hunger if you can believe that
getting a complex buddy
fisher let him talk
sits but one of those guys not one of them knew her at all
each one was convinced that she was perfect for them but they didnt see her
and she never showed up so they couldnt see her
its a very symbolic thing happening
she becomes what she thinks they wanted to be
fisher doesnt like the sound of this
he glances at ellie who is looking very interested
in shock ike is turning sensitive and i cant bear to watch
im going to make a fresh pot of tea
the phone rings as fisher exits
ike goes to the piano as ellie picks up the phone
into phone yeah
hangs up then yells to fisher fisher dont forget the fortune cookies
she joins ike at the piano
ike gets serious
is that what i did to you
is that what happened
did i just not see you
no you didnt
he hugs her
heartfelt well im sorry im really sorry ellie
im sorry too
that only took us between years to say
ellie blinks back sentimental tears
we hear hawaiian music
we see a truck with guests drive up and hula dancers through barn slats
its a small barn thats been converted into a luau with a bar
a band plays for two hula dancers
the trouts had decorated it as a little slice of hawaii
there are tiki lights numerous rented plastic palm trees and fiberglass copies of hawaiian statuary
strings of colored lights crisscross the ceiling
it looks like a hawaiian high school gym on prom night
maggies family mrs
trout and people weve already met and more are here milling around wit tropical drinks garnished with umbrellas
plastic leis abound and most people have managed to find their old hawaiian shirts
as we come in the hula dancers finish their applause and mrs
hula dancers stop
welcome to our annual country luau
as you know betty and i got married on the rim of the crater diamond head
grabbing the microphone this year were dedicating our first dance to the soon to be newlyweds the king and queen of hawaii maggie and bob
the couple enters
bob is a goody bronzed god in his king kamahamela outfit
maggie is spectacular in her authentic looking hawaiian princess get up
but her face reflects none of the festivities around her
every now and then she looks up and glances around for ike hating herself for it
trout contd king and queen dance
maggie and bob start to dance as the quarter sings aloha oe
trout contd everybody dance
maggie and bob pose for pictures with some of the guests
pictures of the king and queen
dennis poses with maggie
cory poses with bob
trout runs out of film and goes to get more leaving peggy and maggie alone
peggy whispers to maggie
lighten up wahine
lighten up what
this party is for you and bob
get your mind off the reporter
i havent seen him in twenty four hours
it just gives me the creeps a little bit
id feel better if i knew where he was
nods to door would it
angle on ike just entering the party
at least he tried
hes got a tropical sheet wrapped around his pants and shirt
he walks to the bar and is greeted warmly by lee
maggie gets very flustered
peggy contd what are you doing
after a beat im going to go dance with bob
because hes the man
referring to her headdress i like those grapes
maggie dances affectionately with bob as mr
trout tending bar greets ike
graham welcome to our luau
what can i get you
you got something without a toy in it
a pair of expressive pantomime a little grass shack
trout is on stage introducing hula contestants
grandma judges the hawaiian dancing
the party is at full tilt a little wild a little goofy
some guests bob cindy cory lee and ted do the limbo
pressman doesnt turn as she hears him
thats a very fetching headdress youre wearing
ike leans into maggie enjoying the smell of her hair
she notices but acts casual
where did you disappear to
missed me bad huh
all the guests start banding their pineapple cups
walter rises unsteadily lifting his pineapple
listen to walter
listen close he slurs
then shut up wahines
in the tradition that has grown through the years it is now toast time
first up our host a honey of a beekeeper lou trout
lou trout stands with his glass raised
may the grooms heart be filled with hopes and the brides feet be filled with lead
there are shouts of hear hear
may the pitter patter of little feet not be maggies
may the gifts be returned
may the back of the dress be as pretty as the front
the laughter swells and swells led by walter
ike watches as maggie takes the heat raising her glass along with the others
bob raises his glass like the good sport he is
ike cant believe it
you know the old saying youre not losing a daughter
well id like to
walter gets a bit laugh
he goes again
walter contd maggie may not be hales longest running joke
under her breath maggie finishes the punchline along with his father
but shes certainly the fastest
maggie looks terribly pained
ikes had enough
he pushes himself to his feet
walter is thrilled
he shushes the crowd
walter contd oh look mr
graham how about a toast
i dont know give me a minute
to maggie are you all right with this
are you all right with this
you think this is funny
i dont and i dont think you should
its a joke
yell come on and give us a toast
you want me to make a toast
ill give you a toast
to maggies family and friends
may you find yourselves the bulls eye of an easy target
may you be publicly flogged for all of your bad choices and may your noses to rubbed in all of your mistakes
ike watches their reaction
the silence is deafening
all the guests stare at maggie
mortified she holds back tears
that was funny
a pause but enough toasts lets hula
lets start the music up
she gets everyone up to hula
band plays fast tune
maggie walks through the crowd down the steps and outside
ike follows but peggy grabs a coat for her
bob watches her go as cory approaches
i got twenty dollars bet on not now
bob rushes after maggie
calling after her maggie
to ike handing him a jacket here
she may need this
its not really hawaii
then bob comes over
whered maggie go
oh she just went to get me something from the car
cory comes over with dennis to bob and peggy
bob peggy cory dennis chuffa about bart starr and football
which keeps bob from going outside to follow maggie
bob thinks about it
ike runs after maggie
he grabs her arm and turns her to him
im the only goddamn person in there pulling for you
you humiliated me
no maggie i defended you
humiliating you is what everyone else is doing
its the theme of this party
i had it under control
now they feel sorry for me
well they should
because theyre about to watch you hang yourself again
maggie has no response
ike contd tell me something do you really care about mount everest
or the sexual habits of locusts
that was very interesting research george was doing
what kind of dead head gets a temporary tattoo
i already explained about that
and where you ever really going to run the leper colony in molokai
wincing brian told you that
or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress
every one of those times i was being supportive
something you wont understand
you werent being supportive
you were being scared
just like now
you are the most lost woman i have ever laid eyes on
youre so lost you dont even know how you like your eggs
with the priest you liked them scrambled
with the dead head fried
with the bug guy poached
now its egg whites only thank you very much
thats called changing your mind
no thats called not having a mind of your own
what are you doing maggie
you really want to let that man drag you up annapuma on your honeymoon
you dont want to climb annapuma
yes i do
no you dont
you want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet
you want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem
you want a man to wake you up at dawn because hes burning to talk to you and he cant wait another minute to find out what youll say
am i right
hes laid her flat
maggie cant speak
ike contd am i right
she fights back angry tears
im getting married on sunday and youre just trying to make me run
because youre a cynical exploitative mean hearted creep who wouldnt know real love if it bit him in the armpit
and all you do is tear other people down and and and laugh at them and criticize what they do because youre too afraid to do anything yourself
i read your column
you never wrote one about you
im not the only one whos lost and you know it
am i right
am i right
angle on bob comes outside
help me out here
both maggie and ike are breathing hard
bob comes up to maggie and gives ike a very hard look as he puts his arm around his fiancee
bob contd you know
blocked bart starr crewcut are you okay
maggie adjusts her face as best she can
let me take you back inside okay
she lets him lead her away
ike looks at her drooped shoulder and he shakes his head and walks to his car
peggy and cindy arrive for the rehearsal
they leave cindys dog in peggys car and walk to the church
tell me why does maggie need another wedding rehearsal and two days before the wedding
shes already done this
bob is making her visualize the ceremony
they are in the church proper now
peggy waits in a pew as bob leads maggie and ike up the back steps of the church
to maggie okay were ready
want me to have ike leave now
maggie turns on ike with cheerful hostility
no actually lets make ike the pastor
id rather not
sarcastically come on itll give you a great view
seeing peggy hey
maggie smiles at bob
ike sighs and goes with it
bob pulls ike to the head of the aisle and places him
peggy follows maggie into the foyer to get ready
cindy sits with ted at the organ
team effort pastor ike
after no response cindy come on
cindy leaves to join the girls in the foyer
once in the privacy of the foyer peggy and maggie talk
hes going to be the pastor
i want him to be front and center and to watch everything
what happened at the luau
flustered i dont even want to talk about the luau
then seeing a hanging rope whats this
its for the bell
cindy joins them
bobs in a hurry
dont be nervous maggie
let us visualize
remember what bob said
be the ball
sink the putt
make the shot
nothing but net
never say die
maggie puts her hands up
peggy and cindy exit
maggie pulls the bell rope and sways back and forth as she rings the bell
it is maggies turn to enter
they all turn expectantly
too much time passes
ted plays the organ then stops
maggie swings back and forth in the foyer doorway
honey are you okay
maggie stops ringing the bell and pulls herself together
she walks into the aisle looking a little shaky
she takes a few tremulous steps slowly with her eyes closed peeking occasionally with one eye
taking off his jacket at this pace it could be an evening wedding
i think were taking this too fast
he begins to pace
bob contd we need to limber you up a little
thinks a moment to ike moving him to grooms spot you stand here and be me so she knows how far shell have to go
then to maggie im going to walk with you
bob goes to maggie and walks behind her
bob contd visualize
its game time
bob contd you are the football
youre spiraling through the air towards the hands of the groom
she proceeds down the aisle
bob behind her
eyes down yes im spiraling through the air
maggie raises her eyes and sees ike in front of her as groom
ike and maggie lock gazes
if they had to they couldnt look away
all the things unspoken are now communicated the love the longing
maggie contd i streak towards the goal line
maggies pace quickens
maggie contd and i land on the goal line
bob beams to see maggies eager arrival at ikes side
he switches off the music and proceeds like a proud coach to be the pastor
okay im the pastor
dearly beloved blah blah blah
so on and so forth
ra ta ta ta
i now pronounce you man and wife
kiss the bride badum dum
then moving toward ted we have the crescendo that leads to us right back down the aisle and out the
ike kisses maggie
it is a world class olympic kiss
it is a kiss that changes everything and can never be taken back
it is a kiss you only get once in your life
bobs smile dies
cindys mouth drops open as the kiss goes on and on
peggy loses control and screams
bob contd maggie
like a bucket of water thrown on two dogs ike and maggie are startled out of their kiss
they pull apart and smile at each other
angle on bob
bob contd furious if you were imagining me you did great
to ike what the hell were you doing
eyes on maggie im sorry bob
she kissed me back
dazed but happy i kissed him back
yeah i caught that
want to tell me how long this has been going on
maggie looks at ike wondrous confused
about a minute
a little longer for me
what do you expect me to say to this
how about i hope youll be very happy together
bob hauls back and punches ike in the face
i hope youll be very happy together
bob storms down the aisle and out of the church
to peggy take care of him
bob is halfway down the walk
maggie appears at the church door and calls after him
bob im sorry
half to herself at least i backed out before the wedding
he keeps marching
now peggy appears next to maggie
maggie calls again
maggie contd some woman is going to make you a lot happier than i ever could
the words are barely out of her mouth when cindy comes out the door racing after bob at a full sprint
maggie contd see
well maggie in the words of mrs
pressman holy moly
call me later
peggy goes to her car
cindy joins her as bob speeds off in his car
now ike takes peggys place next to maggie
maggie turns to face ike
they are both beet red stammering and unable to look at each other trying to act normal
what just happened
i dont know
i uh i frankly dont even want to talk about it
ike grabs maggie and boom they are all over each other kissing frantically tongues hands hair elbow you name it
blathering i love you
i love you
blathering i love you too
they come up for air
we have to talk
we have to do some talking now
pull up a railing
maggie sits on the railing then ike backs up and sits on the opposite railing
ike contd you have to go down an aisle and say i do

ike backs up to opposite railing and sits facing maggie
thinks well you do have the dress

and the wedding date

beat so you think
you have to go down the aisle with somebody you love and who love you back
im okay with that

they both nod and sit there smiling sort of
the organist ted closes the church door
ike pulls his tape recorder out of his pocket and quietly speaks into it
im getting married
they smile at each other and remain sitting
ike drives up and parks in front of the hotel as he talks on his cell phone
ellies on the phone
fisher sits nearby

fisher throws himself onto the carpet and rolls himself helpless with laughter
ellie contd without turning to him fisher if you pee on that persian ill kill you

ellie whispers in his ear

ellie kisses him on the cheek and walks away
bob comes up to ike
he looks like hes going to punch ike then abruptly holds out a rose boutonniere
you look awful
sarcastically thank you
bob hands the flower to ike
ike is shaking
bob catches this and looks up to ike
it is a moment of clean honesty between the men
he takes the boutonniere and puts it on ikes lapel
bob contd im glad its you
i didnt want to find out i wasnt for her in the fourth quarter

motioning to their eyes maintain eye contact
bob turns and leaves going down a side staircase
to himself eye contact
out of the corner of his eye ike sees a pictures of christ on the wall
he leans into the picture and whispers
ike contd cover me
he walks into the chapel
ike steps up and stands next to fisher

the pastor approaches ike
ike turns away and look out over the guests
ikespov there are most of the townspeople weve come to know plus some new yorkers for ike with little ponytails

grandma and walter come in
grandma gives her a kiss on the cheek

walter steps up

peggy turns off the fan
cindy takes the bag from maggie
maggie spits her bubblegum into the bag
peggy hands maggie her bouquet
no sauntering down the aisle

cindy and peggy nod and leave
the door closes

grandma walter mrs
pressman and the trouts watch
trout picks lint off of her husbands jacket
cindy and peggy enter with the confident air of people who have done this before
they make it to the head of the aisle all too quickly
peggy gives ike a wink and an encouraging smile
the door opens and dennis sticks his head in
theyre ready maggie
just a second
dennis closes the door behind him as he goes back into the chapel
maggie has a moment alone
she looks at back door as possible escape route then changes her mind
she signals the start of the wedding by knocking on the door
immediately cory and dennis open the doors for her entrance
all the guests stand as maggie enter the chapel smiling
the aisle stretches before her into infinity
faces goggle at her from every direction
the tiny figure of ike stands like a beacon a long way off
she plunges forward with a sped up hesitation step
ike rocks imperceptibly urging her on
peggy and cindy make little come on motions
it seems to be working
maggie approaches rapidly
the crowd has turned from skepticism to looks and noises of encouragement
but then her feet gradually begin to slow
fisher gives a little darn so close look
but ike is too busy maintaining eye contact
his eyes urge maggie closer loving her willing her on
maggie stops her walk gives ike a teasing smile and then resumes with her walk toward him
her foot inches forward
the other follows
a sigh now rises from the guests as maggie closes in on ike
he smiles at her
she smiles at him
she is almost there
shes there smiling at ike
the pastor gestures to the guests to sit down
she looks down and imagines she sees the carpet splitting apart
and she bolts like a bat out of hell
in a flurry of white she is halfway down the aisle before ike knows what hits him
ike stands there dazed
for a second
then she springs into action charging after her
yelling out block the doors
like a general he points to dennis and cory in the back and sends them into action
the doors shut in maggies face
but shes a wild animal cornered
she moves to the side
the townspeople stand so ike can hurry through the pew
ike climbs on the pews towards her as guest crowd the aisle blocking his path
like a gazelle she leaps to the side aisle and scampers down and away
fisher gets on his cell phone
ike charges from one of the full pews crosses the aisle and leaps across the pews near the staircase to cut her off
he grabs her veil and it comes off in his hands
maggie disappears down the steps of the church basement
ike fumble with the veil and jumps over the railing landing on dennis toe
he follows down the stairs after her
pressman and walter exchange bet money
maggie comes down steps and enters the church childrens sunday school class
a lot of kids and teachers are doing religious arts and crafts
as maggie runs through theres a man coming down those steps with lots of candy in his pockets
if you tickle him hell give candy
she gives her bouquet to a little girl as she goes by
ike comes down stairs
the kids mob him grabbing his pockets
ike fights his way through kids
maggie as shes in the church kitchen and hops on counter and heads out the window
the window is wide enough
ike as he gets to the window but maggie is out in driveway
maggie flies toward a fedex truck at next house just leaving
she gathers her dress and jumps in as ike yells from window then quickly climbs out onto the lawn as the truck starts to pull away
maggie looks back once tearful and regretful and disappears inside the truck
the truck races off
the photographers turn their cameras on ike en masse
he is enveloped by a barrage of bright lights
ellie and fisher who have also stepped outside on chapel front steps are looking around as ike turns around the corner and past the church
look hes running after her
look hes in pretty good shape
they look after the fedex truck and watch ike chasing the truck down the road away from the church
running yells maggie
where do you think shes going
wherever it is shell be there by ten thirty tomorrow
cindy cory peggy and meredith also rush out of the church and comment on maggies runaway
further down the road ike still chases the truck yelling maggie
as the truck rounds the bend in the road and disappears ike stops and stares alone after the disappearing truck
a swarm of reporters catch up to him flashing pictures and asking questions
another camera flashes and we cut to of ikes stunned face on the cover of the usa today
the caption reads hit and run runaway bride strikes again
and we see headlines in other papers
kevin the bartender reads jays column in the usa today entitled maggies mad dash
various newspaper workers also read jays column in the usa today entitled maggie mad dash and hardware honey goes nuts and bolts in another newspaper
its a night like any other in hale the regular order of things has been restored on its quaint streets
quartet sings in front of the hotel

maggie is sitting end of a long day
peggy sticks her head in entrance door

peggy starts to go then moves close to maggie
peggy contd stepping closer and making a v with her fingers you know i was just thinking about that geese thing
i think the v was half of a w

maggie stares losing herself in thought
then a voice startles her
whispers marry me maggie
maggie jumps and turns to see dennis the kid from the high school football team popping up from a low position near the counter
softly hi dennis
i am going to propose you know
i mean the right way
soon as i turn eighteen
youre sweet dennis
but youve got to go

dennis takes the candy and starts to go
im not giving up
a person shouldnt give up
maggie is alone
she turns out the lamp she designed then on again
she turns off the other lamp on the counter and exits
we hold on maggies designed lamp
ike walks up to his door carrying his mail and a bag of carryout
he opens the door and walks into his apartment
he pets italics who sits on his sofa bed
without taking off his coat he goes to his keyboard and plays music as he chuffas to his cat about marriage and divorce
dad and grandma julia are there
grandma is making lunch
walter is juggling oranges
theres glass of beer on the kitchen counter

maggie walks in and kisses grandma on the cheek
grandma whats for lunch

walter looks at his daughter in surprise
hes never heard a tone like this in her voice before
quiet fury just stop it
dont say another word like that
putting down the oranges maggie its just a joke
its my life
a harmless joke
no its humiliating and youve been doing it since i was a kid
i dont like it
you may not like having a daughter with problems
but guess what
i dont like having a father whos drunk all the time
ill eat in my room
maggie takes a plate and exits
that needed to be said
you know youre always making jokes about her so they wont make jokes about your drinking
ike goes out on his terrace
he bounces a basketball
it doesnt bounce
he sits on the steps of the patio an stares
maggie is kickboxing
maggie is a bit melancholy as she works on her lamps
ike quietly sits in bed writing and staring into space thinking
his cat sits on the windowsill
maggie jumps rope barefooted late at night
i need a plan
a plan to life
what would bruce lee do
hed kick some ass
maggie in front of plates full of all sorts of types of eggs scrambled poached sunny side up benedict soft boiled etc sits on the kitchen counter
she ties them all
two men try to fix the engine of a taxi outside the restaurant
eke walks by the t shirt vendor goes into a subway station
ike crosses a busy street where a man is being arrested
ike is passing the upscale millennium hardware store
he glances at the window looks away stops and looks again
the window display is made up of an assortment of maggies lamps
logo mag is on them
he smiles and walks on
ike stares out at water as he walks
ike walks along sidewalk crosses street enters his building
ike opens the door to his apartment and flicks on the lights
he crosses to hang his coat in the closet
in the closet mirror he sees and is stunned to find maggie sitting on the couch holding italics the cat
he closes the closet and crosses to his desk
dont tell me
my doorman is one of your many admires
i knew i should have given him a better christmas gift
maggie smiles tenuously
shes more than a little terrified
ive been making friends with your cat
then is it okay that im here
i dont have much choice in the matter now do i
but i cant speak for italics
to cat traitor
he moves to the kitchen
i dont blame you for being mad
ike looks at her
apparently the word mad is an understatement
maggie contd or
ike looks at her again
maggie contd irate
he starts putting cat food in a bowl
the cat leaves maggies side and starts to east
livid is good
so what is it maggie
you here on business
i saw your lamps
its something ive always wanted to do
ike leaves the kitchen turns on the balcony lights and re enters the living room from the balcony
you actually could make breaking and entering into a new career
after opening the glass doors so what are you doing here
i wanted to talk to you about why i run or ride away from things
ike moves away from her and sits on the steps near the balcony window listening
after sitting does it matter
i think so
when i was walking down the aisle
i was walking toward somebody who didnt have any idea who i really was
and it was only half the other persons fault because i had done everything to convince him that i was exactly what he wanted
so it was good that i didnt go through with it because it would have been a lie but you you knew the real me
yes i did
and you being the one at the end of the aisle didnt just fix that
ike takes this in
shes reaching him but then the defenses go back up
he turns to her
no i couldnt fix anything
as he gets up but i still ended up chasing a truck
ike moves out to the balcony
after a moment maggie follows him
the balcony overlooks central park
the twinkling lights of the city stretch out across the beautiful night
ike looks out at the view with his back to maggie as she speaks
i understand why you bring up the truck
let me explain something
the fact is youve seen me at my worst most embarrassing deviously plotting potentially but not certifiably psychotic state
and if you liked me then i mean now
i cant imagine
crosses to him benedict
ike has no response
maggie contd i love eggs benedict
i hate all the other kinds
maggie contd i hate big weddings with everybody staring
i would like to get married on a weekday while everybody is at work
if i ride off into the sunset i want my own horse
should i be writing this down
she returns to the balcony and hands him the box
ike contd whats this
these are for you
he opens it
its her running shoes
im turning in my running shoes to you
this is getting serious
now she is glowing at him shining with the full force of her
and one more thing
i know its hard to believe there could be more
maggie glances around and spots a deck chair which she turns so it is facing the city lights
then she softly says maggie contd if you could have a seat please
maggie takes the box from him and puts it aide
and then she gets down on one knee
laughing oh my god
maggie smiles up at him
ike tips his head back and covers his eyes with his hand
no no dont hide your face this only happens once in a lifetime
its definitely a first to me and youre not going to want to miss it
he smiles as he looks at maggie
maggie contd i love you homer eisenhower graham
will you marry me
ike swallows overwhelmed overjoyed and scared shitless
maggie i gotta think about this a little bit
maggie hops cheerfully back to her feet
she gets off her knees and stands
maggie contd i was hoping youd say that
laughing you were not
i was because if you said yes right away i wouldnt get to say this next part
and ive been practicing it
pulling up a chair and sitting ready
tenderly i guarantee that well have tough times
i guarantee that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out
but i also guarantee that if i dont ask you to be mine ill regret it for the rest of my life
because i know in my heart youre the only one for me
ike takes her hands affectionately
pretty good speech maggie
i borrowed it from this guy i know
ike looks into maggies shining face and pauses
he gets up and motions with his hand for her to stay seated
he goes inside and turns on some music
the cat is sitting by the radio
he returns to the balcony and takes maggies hand
dance with me
they start to dance a slow dance
we see a hill and on top of it is a pastor marrying maggie and ike in beautiful wedding attire
we see maggie walk down a leaf lined aisle to a waiting ike
they kiss as we hear the vows and hear them each say i do
they kiss a twirling whirling kiss a circular kiss
we hear the applause of about twenty people
slowly we see the twenty people come over the crest of the hill
they are all maggies family and friends plus the old grooms
they are all paired in twos like a love noahs ark
we see others get the news
priest brian hears about maggies wedding
trout hears about maggies wedding
george groom hears about maggies wedding
ellie and fisher hear about maggies wedding
maggie and ike finally break the kiss
ike takes her hand and walks her to two horses
ike and maggie on the two horses ride off happily in their wedding clothes
as the group cheers maggie throws bouquet
we see it float in the air
