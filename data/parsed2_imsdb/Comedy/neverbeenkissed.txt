never been kissed b
b if window
href b b revised draft by jenny bicks based on the original screenplay by abby kohn marc silverstein revision its josie geller cute blonde and scared out of her wits
we hear the chanting of a crowd
you know in some movies how they have a dream sequence only they dont tell you its a dream
pull out to reveal josie on pitchers mound of a its packed
reporters line the field
all eyes are on josie
this is so not a dream
the stadium clock sets at
the crowd goes crazy
josie takes a deep nervous breath and smiles oh god
multiple images of josie play across rows of tv sets
a crowd has gathered
it wasnt supposed to be like this
i was just trying to do my job
and then things happened
well life happened
and now im here
the clock starts to tick down
the crowd yells again
i am not the kind of girl who does things like this
i mean two months ago you couldnt have picked me out of a crowd
packed with office workers
bustling with activity
the camera searches the crowd
im over there
the camera swings to josie entering
rhoda a young copy assistant tails her pen and paper in hand
theater standard american calls for er
standard british is re
so go for er unless youre a pompous american then go for british
josie keeps negotiating the maze leaving rhoda in her wake
we were supposed to go remember
josie stops at a desk where merkin burns officious office assistant is talking on the phone
he picks his nose with abandon as he talks ignoring josie
into phone no way
ech hold on
to josie what
merkin removes his finger from his nose and uses it to pick up a pink message
he holds it out to josie
disgusted she takes it by one corner
into phone seriously
no way josies still standing there
what merkin do you think we could get some more yellow highlighters
i checked the box and were merkin swivels his chair degrees so his back is to josie and continues with his phone call
back into phone okay im back so josie sighs walks to her door
its marked with a lopsided nameplate josie geller copy editor
she adjusts the plate so its perfectly straight
josie enters reads the messsage still gingerly held in two fingers and drops it into the trash can
she hangs her coat squarely on the back of her door takes five pencils from her pencil pot one by one sharpens them in her pencil sharpener and then lays
them out neatly in a row
she smiles satisfied ready for another day
anita brandt late s pretty in a semi unprofessional way bursts in smiling
guess who i did it with last night
duh roger in op ed
yesterday you said and i quote i have a date with roger from op ed tonight and im going to do it with him
well that doesnt mean it was going to happen for sure
josie just stares at her
once it didnt happen for sure
gus strauss late s would probably clean up well enters
he tosses some copy onto josies desk
i need it back by five
hopefully the copys not a mess
emphasizing it is hoped that its not a mess
hopefully is an adverb
it means with hope
you have it defining the copy and im pretty sure the copy doesnt have feelings
gus and anita just stare at josie
well excuse me for caring about words
to anita so
you and roger in op ed
roger in op ed
dont make me send you another memo about my policy on inter office dating
and theyre not dating
theyre having sex
and what is your policy
that if youre not getting any no one can
anita flounces off
how many times have i fired her
five six shrugging giving up eh
gus turns to exit
hey gus did you see the story idea i left on your desk
yeah the blind foster home mother
it was good
i got cahoon on it
yeah hes good
geller weve been over this
youre a great copy editor
maybe my best copy editor
youre not a reporter
youve done five of my ideas
you know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters
they dont have to be in the office christmas show
a flack jacket
not getting it a flack jacket
every tom dick and harry thinks he can write
but a journalist gets in there right where the bombs are
grabs the bull by the balls
you dont think i can grab bulls balls
geller you dont want a reporters life
theyre very messy
youre all about order
and getting me my copy by five
hey i can be out of control
on his way out he re adjusts josies nameplate so it hangs at an angle
tormented josie waits a beat
she cant take it and runs to the door and straightens it
over his shoulder copy by five
actually a pretty depressing kitchenette area
anita and josie eat lunch anita eats chinese out of a container josie has three baggies of perfectly cut food in front of her
do you think im aggressive
anita ponders a moment
remember when they took your office chair in for repairs and forgot to return it
you stood for like a month
cynthia an affable african american woman in her s enters and puts three microwave meals in the microwave
just because im not out of control doesnt mean i cant write
josie you listen to me
if you feel youre a writer touching her chest here deep inside dont let anyone tell you youre not
look at me
every day i come to this paper and i pour my heart and soul into what i do
i feel it passionately to the core of my being
you write obituaries
hey if you can make a busted aorta sound good honey thats art
the microwave dings off
cynthia fishes the three lean cuisines out
anita and josie share a look
cynthia arent they only diatetic if you eat them one at a time
i eat em one at a time
to josie yknow maybe gus has a point
it wouldnt kill you to relax and have some fun
rogers got a friend marshall in editing
the one with the lazy eye
maybe we could double date
i swear to god jos
when is the last time you went on a real live date
im concentrating on my career right now
do you own any colored underwear
youre way under youre cute some guys find white carters underwear sexy beat if you talk to his nose you dont even notice the eye
josie laughs in spite of herself
the right guy is out there
im just not going to kiss a whole bunch of losers to get to him
yeah but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion
when i finally get kissed ill know
anita and cynthia trade looks
if youve never kissed a guy we got bigger problems than the underwear
ive kissed guys
ive just never kissed a guy
felt that thing that thing
is that what you kids are calling it these days
you kiss someone and its like the world around you gets all hazy and the only thing in focus is you and this other person and you know that one
person is the person youre meant to be kissing for the rest of your life
and for that one moment youve been given this amazing gift and you want to laugh and cry at the same time because youre so lucky you found it and
so scared that it will all go away
anita and cynthia take this in
you are a writer
basically a mailbox etc
store but dressed in a tahitian theme
cardboard hula dancers hold fedex envelopes
rob geller good looking wears a smock with tiki post emblazoned across it over a hawaiian shirt
he stands watch at the cash register
monty maylik proud owner rearranges a display
the place is empty
hey monty you think well get any business today
of course im handing out a free lei to every customer
what do you think
i think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches
change is scary
robbie let me tell you a little something about the mail business
ive been in it over thirty years
and in those thirty years the only thing thats changed is the elvis stamp and some gun laws
people are bored
they wanna shake things up
i thought people just wanted their mail delivered on time
josie walks into the store triggering hawaiian music
monty puts a lei over her head
its just my sister
monty takes the lei off her neck
josie hands rob an envelope
rob rifles through the cash inside
ill pay you back
bambi thanks you too
rob indicates a beat up wreck of a yellow car parked outside
that is so weird that you name your car
no its not
guys name their penises
then that cars going to bankrupt you
she just needs a new windshield wiper
because i bought the windshield last week
im a hubcap away from owning more of bambi than you do
rob hands the money back
i dont want it
josie hands it back
rob take the money okay
its no big deal
no it is
its just one more thing to add to your things that make you a better person than me list
better person than i
i know this woman
she works in admissions at lakeshore community
she might be able to get you in for the fall semester
maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship and i could help and im not going to college jos
and im not playing anymore baseball
this is my life
whispering this this is a luau that sells packing material
someday this luau is going to be all mine
how can you just give up like that
you had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything
dont you want more
to move out of mom and dads
pay your own bills
and then i could be as happy as you
for your information i am very happy
i lead a very happy life
the music starts up again
we pan around the neatest and quietest walk up youve ever seen
lots of books on shelves
we find josie sitting at her small table putting the finishing touches on a needlepoint pillow
she turns it over and we see it says love
she holds up the final product to a terrarium lookup up at her two turtles
what dyou think guys
where should it go
josie looks around the living room
she pretends to listen to the turtles
she walks into the bedroom with the pillow
a perfectly arranged laura ashley bedroom
we pan over to the bed
it is completely covered in needlepoint pillows
josie places the latest one on top of the others and smiles
its packed with the newspaper staff
hyram rigfort white haired dignified owner of the paper presides
anita and josie sit next to each other
next to anita sits roger from op ed a good looking guy in his s
let me start out by saying that i was very impressed by the investigative piece dutton did on pesticides in our supermarkets
an older man dutton smiles proudly
but since the trib did a better piece on the same subject youre fired
duttons face falls
everyone looks horrified
you heard me
dutton shuffles out
josie takes a big bite of donut
happy march everybody
by rote happy march mr
to celebrate ive decided its time for another undercover feature
everyone looks underwhelmed
you all know that some of my best inspiration comes from personal experience
who knew that my botched foray into hair plugs would lead to last months award winning expose hair today gone tomorrow
hats off to you bruns
we pan over to bruns a reporter whose hair is missing in odd looking clumps
he nods sadly
or should i say hats on
and what about when my wife had that affair with gil her ski instructor and howard went undercover as an expert slalom skier
howard smiled wanly
both his arms are in casts
camera pans the room as rigfort continues picking out different reporters
so last night im sitting around the dinner table with my family
the wife the two nannies the boys and were eating chicken with this peanut sauce
camera stops at a chef boyardee look alike
i like it
hang on gus
so were eating this peanut sauce and suddenly the younger kid starts choking
camera stops at a nurse ratchet look alike
sotto to josie im smelling undercover er nurse
turns out hes allergic to peanuts
and i think holy shit
i dont even know my own kids
i mean who knows if theyre even mine
and it got me thinking
how much do we know about kids today
what are they thinking
how many of them are allergic to peanuts
it hit me my semester in high school
camera stops at a bald guy the jerks over one seat to josie
to josie you
whats your name
you enroll on friday
general crowd hubub
josies in shock
but im not a reporter yet
and none of these geezers could pass for a day under
and rigfort exits
josie is so excited she can hardly speak to anita
its finally happening anita
im going to write
anita looks concerned
my own undercover feature written by josie geller
jos maybe you should turn it down
josies face falls
you dont think i can do it
no its just a lot of pressure for your first piece thats all
i mean its not a half page article its a major undercover piece jos
look what rigfort did to dutton and that guys his cousin
dont worry ill straighten all this out
but i dont want it straightened out
geller this is way out of your league
josie takes in anita and gus
okay just so im clear here neither of you think i can do this
jos thats not what were anita when you wanted to seduce the guy in the mailroom and you didnt think you could learn spanish fast enough who quizzed you on
anita looks down chastened
and gus when you picked up knitting who showed you how to hold the needles
sotto you did
to gus you knit
so this is my chance
im not holding your job for you geller
josie jumps up and down and hugs gus who is clearly uncomfortable
dont make me send you the memo on hugging in the workplace
i do believe in you jos
anything you need ill help you out
josie sits motions to the brown paper bag
you can start by handing me that bag
josie sticks it over her face flips her head between her knees and starts hyperventilating again
close up on rob wearing his tiki post outfit
he shakes his head
pull out to reveal him standing with josie on the sidewalk in front of josies shiny buick is parked right behind bambi at the curb
its just for a couple of months
you cant just borrow my car for a couple of months
thats like ten years in bambi life
ill give you my buick le sabre
rob rolls his eyes and enters the store
you can name it whatever you want
josie follows rob into the store
this must be big
i got an assignment from the paper
im going undercover
back to high school
rob starts laughing uncontrollably
do you remember high school
it was a long time ago dont you remember what they called you
slowly josies face falls
she looks very far away
josie its packed with kids
everyone stares off screen at chants josie grossie
josie looks stricken
i came up with it
beat you look nauseous
i look nauseated
she puts her hand over her mouth races for the bathroom
josie has just gotten violently ill
she rises off her knees grabs some toilet paper to wipe her mouth
she looks down at her feet
we close up on brown leather oxfords and widen to reveal teenage josie braces heavy glasses in all her nerdom slowly walking down the corridor with a huge backpack on
a boy sneaks up behind her holds open the top of her backpack while another boy pours a half drunk sprite into her backback
kids smile and snicker as josie continues down the hallway
she spots billy prince ultmate high school heartthrob and approaches him nervously
hey billy prince i noticed you werent in math today and i have the notes in case you want midway through josies speech we hear the odd sound of liquid
josie follow billys gaze down to between her feet where a pool of sprite has gathered
billy starts to laugh
kids around him join in
as the laughter echoes around her we dissolve back to josie stares into the mirror
staring back is teenage josie
this is a very bad idea
anita and josie cruise through a teen clothing store carrying large bags from a stationery store
josie picks up a platform sneaker and just stares at it
so you were a geek
anita remember espadrilles
that doesnt make you a nerd
everyone wore those shoes
the girls threw them at me in the locker room
at the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool
then just because you were a nerd once doesnt mean its going to happen again
thats why you have me for fashion consultation
anita pulls a slip skirt off a rack and holds it up
now this is cute
that is lingerie
so i was thinking about what you were saying yknow about really being kissed
i think roger could be the one
whatd you feel when you kissed him
josie pulls out a plain button down cardigan
how about this
i am not letting you out of the house in that young lady
anita grabs an awful white maribou jacket and matching earrings and holds them up
nita this is about reporting not accessorizing
and were going to have to do something about your hair
jos please try and have some fun here okay
how many of us get to go back to high school
youre gonna have a blast
on a bedside table
surrounded by make up boxes of hair color a stack of index cards ripped magazine pages of teen looks issues of teen beat and ym
the clock slips to
npr starts playing
a hand reaches over hits the radio off
sound effects a school bell
as the bell continues to ring we widen to josie sits up in bed covers pulled up to her chin in terror
music up morning train
crowds of commuters stream down the sidewalk and onto the stairs leading up to the el
a big yellow car jerks into frame backfires noisily
its josie at the wheel of bambi
she jerks out of frame
a suburban campus anchored by a main building
cars pull into the parking lot for the beginning of the day
kids greet each other converge on the front doors of the school
bambi pulls in
she jerks into a spot backfiring once more for effect
the entire scene stops
kids freeze look at josie
a beat and they they continue on their way
josie takes a few deep breaths
okay i can do this
piece of cake
i can do this
josie steps out of the car wearing the maribou jacket earrings and white jeans
she shuts the door behing her starts walking
she has unknowingly shut her jacket in the door and as she walks a piece of maribou rips trailing behind her like a tail
josie merges with the throngs of kids and is literally pushed into the lobby
she stares around overwhelmed
banners share space with signs that read days til prom
she inches her way along the wall until she is stopped by a guard who grabs her arm
hey where are you going
oh im a student
most definitely a student
in high school
i am going to class
with my fellow students
greeting random kids hi
the guard stares at her a beat and then motions behind them to three huge metal detectors that the kids are filtering through
josie smiles whoops walks back
under his breath freak
josies stuff lays out on the post detector table cell phone laptop mini tape recorder electronic organizer pager being scrutinized by the guard
josies sure shes been found out
down from josie we see other kids belongings spread out
they have the identical high tech equipment
the guard picks up josies nail file examines it weapon
and throws it in the trash
josie stares at her class card and eyes the classrooms totally lost
she approaches a boy in a flannel shirt and loose jeans
hi um im looking for room ms
as soon as the boy starts to talk we notice something in his mouth a tongue pierce
josie does too
we zoom in on that shiny little metal ball
josie is fixated
so fixated that we stop hearing the boys voice
all we see is the mouth and that ball moving
the mouth closes
josies face is contorted in imagined pain
catching herself i mean wow
and josie takes off totally embarrassed
under his breath freak
josie walks up to room
opening the door shes met by a sea of faces
knox mid forties distracted but bubbly sits in the front of the class
josie walks in
kids whisper and snicker
sorry im late
yes well im sorry i forgot to take my hot flash medication this morning
mi casa es su casa
josie makes her way to the desk trailing maribou
the class titters
she sits in front of two girls kirsten and kristen beautiful and intimidating
that is so sad i know like five chickens had to die just so she could look that stupid
josie in my classroom tardiness is unacceptable im really sorry ms
knox pulls a ridiculously huge sombrero out from under her desk
the class laughs in recognition
not as sorry as i am
knox puts the sombrero on a less than thrilled josie
ten minutes in this hat youll never be late again
so lets hear something about you
the sombrero drops over her eyes
she adjusts it so she can read her notecards
close up on the notecard its filled with precise script under a heading my past
she scans it then flips the cards face down on the desk
confidently she begins my name is josie
im a high school student
i came from just then the classroom door opens
we see from josies perspective a blinding light josie squints
from the light emerges a shadowy vision of billy prince
josie blinks reveal not billy but a beautiful guy guy
he stands very close to her
catching herself bali
another beat im from billy bali
its a suburb of bali proper
guy pushes past her tosses a wooden hall pass to ms
knox and moves to his seat
what did your family do there
josie looks around in panic sees a student in a south glen south windbreaker with huge ram on the back
we were sheep farmers
we raised sheep
in billy bali
josie realizes the trouble shes gotten herself into
oh my god
caught oh my god do i miss billy bali
beat it had a really great
josie rushes down the hall still toting her enormous bag
a huge banner south glen our nations best prom hangs prominently
she talks covertly into a hand held tape recorder
note to self research bali
kill anita for picking out this outfit
find and destroy sombrero
josie and her enormous bookbag enter
she takes a seat toward the back of the room
kristen kirsten and gibby another beauty enter and head to the back of the room
kirsten and gibby stand over josie staring at her
we sit here
sorry i didnt know these were assigned
josie quickly gathers her things and moves one row forward next to two empty seats
two stoners shuffle over to josie
we sit here
indicating two empty seats couldnt you two sit there
except there are three of us the stoners eye each other then the two seats
a look of horror comes over stoner
stoner contd dude we left jed at the
josie picks up her stuff moves to the last empty seat in the room in the front row surrounded by denominators who all wear orange denominator sweatshirts
sitting next to josie is aldys a denominator intense wise with a whole bunch of math medals on her sweatshirt
she smiles at josie
josie smiles back and looks up as mr
coulson enters the room
hes a ruggedly handsome twenty something yale grad
he grabs a notebook out of his bag goes around to sit on the front of his desk sipping coffee from a styrofoam cup
spots josie i don t think weve met
im sam coulson although for some reason the school has this thing about not letting you guys call me sam
shyly im josie
i think the school would probably be pretty comfortable with you calling me that
josie since youre new i love to drink my coffee during class and since i allow myself to do this i allow everyone to bring beverages to class as well
a beat welcome to shakespeares as you like it
how many of you actually read the assignment last night
about five hands go up
sam contd not bad
now how many of you spent more than thirty minutes eating salty snack foods
sam contd man
if i could just get you guys to read while you eat
sam opens his book
aldys notices josie has no book
she moves next to her
we can share
they share a smile
as you like it is an example of a shakespearean sam turns to the blackboard and starts writing
we cu on his butt hardly discernable in his loose jeans all the girls swoon
sam contd pastoral comedy
anyone know what that means
an enthusiastic if slightly dim girl sera waves her hand
oh oh oh
thats what they do to milk
thats pasteurize sera
same letter tapping three fingers on his arm a la charades three syllables parakeet
sotto to josie theres a minute of my life ill never get back
josie smiles at this
okay anyone else josie cant contain herself
pastoral means set in the country
originally seen in the eclogues of virgil
its from the latin pascere
student bleets like a sheep o
sam just stares at her smiling
finally he walks over and shakes her hand
did i mention to the class that i love our new student
did i mention that the class also loves our new kiss ass
josies smile quickly fades
gibby thats not exactly the kind of participation im looking for
gibby looks right at josie
totally insincere ooops
josie just sits there face burning
josie approaches her locker
she cant get to it because a couple is busy making out against it
a girls voice comes over the loudspeaker
shes completely ignored
this is sydney student body president
bad news the district didnt allocate enough funds so as of this afternoon there will be no music department
now about prom the entire hallway freezes
the couple breaks their clinch and looks up
josie is amazed
voting on prom theme has been completed
and the theme is cu on expectant faces
contd the millennium
kids cheer gasp
one girl faints
the crowd surges again
josie caught in the flow doesnt notice a locker door flinging open
she smashes her face right into it
everyone including guy turns and laughs
even some denominators
moves down the food line
its piled with unidentifiable foods and three glasses of fluorescent red punch
hands pull the tray out of the frame
into frame comes another tray this one bearing a perfectly arranged place setting with three celery sticks on a plate
widen to reveal josie pulling the perfect tray down the cafeteria line
she reaches some awful looking cole slaw in a big vat
a cafeteria guy in a plastic cap hovers above it
to cafeteria guy excuse me
whats in the cole slaw
the cafeteria guy hauls an industrial size plastic tub onto the counter and turns it so josie can read the label kole slaw food
josie wrinkles her nose
she moves on to the cash register
thatll be twelve ninety five
stunned oh my gosh
thats real meat in the ham sandwich
josie turns to a girl in line behind her
boy thats a lot of bread for that bread
the girl rolls her eyes reaches past josie to grab a mustard bottle
josie turns with her tray toward the room
cafeteria day flashback kids stare at camera and chant josie grossie josie grossie josie grossie
angle back on josie
standing with her tray paralyzed
the camera spins showing us her back
there tattooed in squeeze bottle mustard is grossie
a boy stands behind her victoriously holding the mustard bottle
josie shakes off the vision and stares out at the crowded cafeteria
she sees kirsten kristen and gibby steels herself and decides to approach
kirsten is eating a bran muffin
kirsten that bran muffin has like fat grams
yeah i read this thing that one bran muffin can be like two bran muffins sometimes
kirsten pushes the muffin away
food is so confusing
to kirsten hi kristen
josie plops herself down with these girls and takes a spiral pad out of her big knapsack
in the process she manages to spill her chocolate milk all over her white jeans
thatll teach me to wear white after labor day
umm i dont think youre supposed to wear white jeans after
they all laugh
josie fakes a laugh too
josie picks up her notepad and her pen
so tell me about yourselves
they all just stare at josie in disgust
guy approaches their table
guy looks at josie
yes you are
quite a guy
look at that i rhymed
very serious are you in special ed
josie stands up grabs her bag and her chocolate milk bye
she leaves the cafeteria passing a couple of denominators
to herself aaaah
how old am i
approximately six thousand three hundred and fifty days old subject to adjustment for month of birth
this is very funny denominator humor to the denominators
josie leaves the cafeteria
josie runs out an exit door and right into a security guard you got a pass
a banner above reads presidential fitness testing this week
fifteen senior girls including josie in matching green and yellow polyester gym clothes do sprints up and down the basketball court
josie looks like shes about to die
brown yells as she passes
move it geller
josie stops grabs the woman by the shoulders
must have water what do i look like your waitress
now youre gonna complete these sprints cause if you dont you fail
and if you fail gym youre never getting into college
oh my god you guys arestill telling that lie
thats it geller drop and give me twenty
josie drops to the gym floor
its finally the end of the day
josie makes her way down the hall clutching her pad of paper getting pushed and shoved by kids as they storm outside
a huge banner hangs overhead reading sign up for senior night
she tries to smile at some kids but they all ignore her
she makes it to the main entrance to the school where we see as she shoves her pad of paper into her bag it is completely blank
kids fill the parking lot
josie walks talking on her cell phone
into phone rhoda make sure gus gets the whole message okay
yeah bye josie arrives where she parked bambi
the space is empty
she still holds the phone to her ear wait a second into phone no not you bye josie shuts the phone looks around
retraces her steps
bambi is gone
josie walks around the lot getting visibly upset
in the corner of the lot we see a group of denominators removing a big metal chain from around a group of tightly packed cars
they do it to all the new kids
josie finds aldys standing next to her
whos of they
aldys motions up to a second floor window
guy and his group look down on them laughing
guy perkins and his amazing lemmings
they push your car out of its space hide it then watch while you look for it
weve taken to chaining ours together for safety
aldys is an interesting name
when its not yours
my mom was going through her harlequin romance phase
try being named after a guitar playing pussycat
aldys doesnt get it
contd never mind
beat that is so awful that they hide your cars
although what is truly awful is that with the combined intellectual effort of every kid in that room right now she points up to the biology room they still would
not know the difference between a synecdoche and a hyperbole
aldys stares josie down
well do you
synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole as in head of cattle whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like i could eat a horse
they stop and look around
how long will they watch us for
until guy tells them to go
once they watched me for like two hours
i found my car the next day in the t
maxx parking lot
why do they listen to guy
duh because hes guy perkins
then listen you want to walk to na nas and get something to eat
lets do that
they start to walk out of the parking lot
josie is visibly thrilled having finally found a friend
josie and aldys share a huge plate of chili fries
yeah isnt it amazing that those guys are our same age
i mean they just seem so much younger you know
oh i know
a waiter delivers two huge chocolate shakes
im going to be so happy to get to college
i hear at northwestern they dont make fun of you for knowing the element table
hey i went to northwestern
a beat once
to use the bathroom
out the window josie sees her buick with rob at the wheel stopped at a red light
detailed on to the side in big white script is the tiki post
josies eyes widen
the light changes
rob pulls away
contd so angry oh
a beat youll really like northwestern
they both slurp down their shakes
so what are your hopes your dreams what do you want to be
professor of medieval literature
aldys takes another slurp of her shake
we hear a muffled cell phone ringing
contd i think your knapsack is ringing
josie takes the cell phone out of her knapsack and answers it
gus speaks into his phone knitting frantically
geller i got your message
what the hell kind of story are you pitching
josie smiles awkwardly at aldys covering the phone
its my dad
into phone hi dad
i miss you too
youre a sick puppy geller
josie indicates to aldys shell be right back and walks to the back of the restaurant by the pay phones
into the phone its an expose on cafeteria food
and youre leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw
well the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf geller
you wanna be a reporter
take a look at what sells
people jumping off buildings
so unless a kid just killed himself because he was being paid to have sex with the school mascot in a big vat of this cole slaw you got nothing
gus slams down his phone
into a dead phone you didnt taste the pimento loaf
she looks back to the table where aldys is dividing the check
in the middle of the track is josies car
the marching band clumsily practices their formations around it
josie and aldys arrive at the car and aldys pops the hood
they love to disconnect the battery too
she looks under the hood reconnects the battery
slams the hood down
contd just so you know i think they recalled these cars in
aldys heads to the lot for her car and then turns around
hey josie how are you at calculus
how would you like to join the denominators
the math team could really use a new brain
we lost our best logarithm guy last year
beat plus we have these really fun pizza study groups and we go to these all county meets
and i mean not that you need it and without sounding too much like the godfather i think we could offer you a certain amount of protection if you know
what i mean
we all kind of stick together and watch out for each other
music up school house rocks magic three josie and denominators walk down the hallway in unison past guys group open their lockers in order a la reservoir dogs take out
paper pencils calculators
josie and aldys both wearing big orange denominator sweatshirts are behind a table manning a bake sale
a banner behind them says n
no one is stopping to buy anything
josie points to the left aldys looks and josie stuffs a whole brownie in her mouth
they laugh uncontrollably as josie starts to choke and cough up most of the brownie
we pan down a row of nervous looking denominator faces as they watch josie sitting head to head against a digit an opposing math a lon competitor
they both work furiously on a problem
a judge sits between them
a makeshift scoreboard hanging off the desk shows the score is tied
josie bangs the bell on the desk and hands the judge her card
he looks it over and gives her team five points
the denominators erupt into cheers
theyre jumping all over josie going crazy
as we go wider we see the gym is entirely empty except for a handful of denominators going crazy on one side and a janitor sweeping up on the other
smiling at each other josie and aldys clutch books excitedly and stand in line
we widen to reveal theyre in line with nerdy adults also clutching their books
at the head of the line is a blow up poster for the new elements of grammar
an old man signs books for his fans
josie is typing on her laptop referencing notes from her notebook
schoolbooks and homework are spread around her
sam is perched on the desk
the usual players in their usual seats
aldys is standing and reading from her book
reading all the worlds a stage and all the men and women merely players
anyone have any idea what shakespeare meant by that
no one answers
sam contd anyone
exchange student who doesnt speak english
we cu on the students ending on an asian boy who smiles wildly at sam and waves
sam smiles and waves back
sam contd its about disguise playing a part
its the theme of as you like it
can anyone tell me where we see that
well rosalind disguises herself as a man and escapes into the forest
and its when shes in costume that she can finally express her love for orlando
see shakespeares making the point here that when were disguised we feel freer
we can do things we wouldnt do in ordinary life
cu on josies face
shes clearly uncomfortable
sam walks up to a huge football player brett
sam contd brett when you go out on the football field in your uniform what happens
you hit people
you touch other guys butts
the class giggles
brett looks horrified
but its okay because youre in uniform
disguise changes the rules beat i had these spiderman pyjamas
i thought when i wore them that i had super powers
one night i tried to walk up the side of the garage
did you make it
to the emergency room
josie smiles at this a little smitten
sam contd josie why dont you read from act scene rosalinds speech josie stands up starts reading no sooner had they met but they looked no sooner looked but they
loved no sooner loved but they sighed
josies voice begins to fade away angle back to josie now seventeen and mortified nervously standing in class and reading a poem
billy prince sits to the side she glances at him throughout the poem its clearly about him
does he notice me
does he hear my heart screaming his name sometimes its so loud i think the gods can hear my pain
his voice is so mellifluous oh to get just one small kiss
the class laughs at her except for billy who smiles at her looking slightly touched
seventeen year old josie is surrounded by an elaborate color coded index card system for her research paper
her friend sheila over weight and pimply comes running across the library at breakneck speed
she sits down next to josie visibly excited and pushes her index cards aside
what have you wanted for like ever but you didnt think it would ever happen
josie looks at her for a moment mulling it over
that theyd start an olympic team for grammar like diagramming sentences and verb declensions and stuff
and im scouted for the team just as an alternate of course because im so young
but then theres talk of me in the games no better
something better josie smiles
im the most popular girl in school and billy prince is taking me to prom
josie laughs at the absurdity
she looks at sheila
sheila is dead serious
billy prince is asking you to prom
i dont know
beat the poem
i knew he liked the poem
all sinking in billy prince is asking me to the prom
thats what im saying
the two girls look at each other
big smiles erupt into screams as they jump up and down hugging each other
sfx the bell rings
its the end of class
students pack their bags
calling out o
just a reminder
your paper is due in one week
aldys and josie head out of class and down the hallway towards their lockers
josie stops in front of hers where the makeout couple continues their clinch blocking her locker
josie pauses frustrated as sydneys voice comes over the loudspeaker
bad news chem wing is closed
the hazardous materials crew is on the way
now about prom
the entire hallway stops to listen
the makeout couple stop making out
please join a committee because we are going to kick northglens butt and make millennium the best prom ever
the hallway erupts in cheers
josie makes a move to go for her locker
the makeout couple are faster
theyre back in their clinch blocking josie again
walking with his group
prom is gonna be rufus
i made it up
start using it
what is with this school and prom
southglen south competes every year for best prom and usually they win
we denominators dont even go to prom
but to everyone else its huge
aldys dont miss your prom it only happens once
this one has been so hyped
were tied for most wins with northglen north
this years winner will determine the winner of the century
the theme is everything
so whatever southglen picks has to be totally unique interior
northglen north high school day kids all stare at a loudspeaker
and this years prom theme is the millennium
the northglen kids go crazy
josie reaches for her knapsack and realizes she left it in english
i left my bag in english
ill see you later
josie dashes down the hallway
sam still sits at his desk
he reads a book
josie picks up her bookbag
she notices the book sams reading contd excited dorothy parker you like her
i love the way she writes
not the happiest of souls
reading out of book art is a form of catharsis and love is a permanent flop
but i think she wanted to be happy thats why she wrote
i mean she was still writing about love right
i guess she hadnt completely given up hope
then are you sure youre seventeen
because seventeen year olds do not like writers from the s
they dont even like people in their s
well im definitely seventeen and off clock now definitely late and she smiles and runs out
aldys drives josie has shotgun and tyke aldys nine year old sister is in back
they all hold double scooped cones and they all sing free to be you and me at full voice
see arent you guys glad you took a break from that denominator stuff
i mean you shouldnt be spending your saturday night studying the whole time
we should be spending it thinking of how we can better serve your baby sitting needs
they pull up at a red light next to an abandoned drive in
josie peers in and sees a big group of kids standing around a bonfire drinking beers talking a few making out
she opens her window sticks her head out and tries to get a better look
thats the old drive in
they call it the court
now its just a continuous party for guys group
angle on gibby and kristen talking by a car
contd sometimes i wonder what they talk about
yeah i know
i mean what if they just stupid to hide the fact that theyre actually brainiacs with super powers and theyre plotting to take over the world and make my life
hell until i die
its lather rinse repeat
suddenly guy pokes his head in startling everyone
wow if it isnt alpo
coming out to sniff some hydrants
josie is frozen but not aldys
oh guy you on a little break from having an original thought
ooops i forgot thats all the time
tyke gets it and laughs
guy doesnt get it at all
you guys arent seriously trying to hang out at the court
oooh cheap wine coolers and a fire in a trashcan
where do i sign up
and stay away from prom
last i checked this was still a free country
singing theres a land that i see where the children are free guys right in aldys face leaning over josie
aldys starts to drive away
guy keeps his head in the window while he runs alongside the car
look geek why dont you just go home and play with your calculator
figure out how many lifetimes it will take you to get cool
guy stops running and the car continues down the street
aldys seems a little shaken tyke continues singing
have you ever wanted to go to the court
are you kidding josie
all they do is stand around and get drunk
yes its lame
yeah it sounds lame
why would we want to go there and stand around
close on a newspaper headline the court site for parties drugs and weekend arrests as gus throws the newspaper down on his desk
josie sits across the desk from him
she reads the headline looking very surprised
josie i am appalled
josie picks up the paper and starts reading intently
jeez so am i
i had no idea that these kids lets see turn to a she tries to turn to a but gus grabs the paper out of her hands in a rage
trying to keep his cool no i am appalled that i have a reporter in there undercover for almost three weeks now i had to read about this in the
gus angrily tries to fold the paper back up
hes having a hard time
josie tries to help but he yanks it away
gus reads aloud from the newspaper
responding officers found minors marijuana and cheap wine coolers when they responded to a call to break up a party at what southglen high schoolers have come to call the
seventeen year old kristen rey says yeah everyone whos anyone is at the court on saturday night
disbelieving kristen got a quote
gus looks up at josie
contd yes urm shes right
i have learned it is a very popular place for the young people to go
have you been there
have you been to any parties
well how would you define to parties
because we ordered a deli platter at this one denominator drill session gus looks like he may combust
he opens the newspaper finds what hes looking for and shoves it in josies face
it is a picture of all of the popular kids at southglen kristen kirsten gibby guy they are all posing for the picture at the court smiling and holding beers
this is where the stories are
you are going to become friends with these people
you are going to party with them

gus i the popular kids and i we just dont i mean i dont think i can do this
he points to the picture in the paper of the popular kids
do you even know these kids

your subject is plural
josie grabs her knapsack and does
josie runs through the bullpen past anitas cubicle
roger from op ed enters
he and anita smile flirtatiously
hi roger from op ed hi anita from classifieds
we still on for tonight
of course and he leans in and kisses her
she pulls away confused
anita kisses him again
anita contd cant believe shes saying it yknow what
no i dont think we are on
i think i have to stay home
liking how it sounds yeah
im staying home
i dont know what ill do there but im gonna do it
roger walks off
rob opens the door still dressed in his tiki post outfit
he takes one look at josie and knows that things are not good
are mom and dad here
theyre at the franklin hint expo at the skokie holiday inn
she shoves her way into the house
josie storms into the den and plants herself on the sofa
she sees that rob has been watching baseball on t
and she turns it off
i cant do it
i thought i could
i give up im never going to be a reporter
rob sits next to her on the couch
he looks up at the t
which is now off
did you catch the score
josie gives him a look of death
no i mean no big whoop
i cant do this
she pulls the article out of her purse and shoves it at rob
he sees the picture of all the popular kids at the court
these girls are high schoolers
damn weve got some underage hotties on our hands here
gus insists that i become friends with these kids
the popular kids
why is that impossible
josies eyes get teary
rob you dont know how it was for me back in high school
no one ever threw juice boxes at you in the hallway
you never dreamed about being popular you already were
all i wanted was to be accepted and they just fucking tortured me
i cant do all that again
i cant go back to southglen south
oh my god
youre at southglen south
they have a killer baseball team
he puts his arm around her
jos youve been to college youre successful you wash your hair now youre not josie grossie anymore
dont you realize how much i wanted to be you in high school
just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular
its not that hard
all you need is one person
once the right person thinks youre cool youre in
everyone else will be too scared to question it
is that true
little known fact
josie takes this in
contd look dont you wanna show them gus billy prince yourself that youre not freaked out by the cool kids anymore
that you can go in there be friends with them and get your story
plus if you quit youre no better than me
better than i
thats the spirit
josie approaches the school
shes clearly made a new attempt at style shes teetering on too high platform shoes and showing a blending white midriff
no one pays much attention to her
george thirty something african american the epitome of cool waves josie over to an open van side door
josie looks confused and scurries to the van
what are you doing here
just get in the van josie
high tech surveillance wonderland meets seventies living room
tape players and monitors share space with shag carpeting and a mini fridge
barry white plays on a tape
george starts to wrap wire around josies waist
he pins a kids plastic captains wings onto her collar
what is this
we used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants is that why they never give you a second bag of nuts
im not doing this until i speak with gus
through speaker geller stop being a pain in the ass
josie looks all around
no its the great and powerful oz
now listen youre in over your head
this is how its gonna work
i review the tapes i find your story
what if i say no
i bet good housekeeping would go gaga over the cole slaw piece
off josies look of concern
a crush of kids flood up the stairs to the front door of the school
we see kirsten kristen and gibby walking three abreast ahead of josie up the stairs
the crowd parts around them
josie heads towards them
kirsten kristen gibby whats up girlfriends
the three girls pause and turn just as josie caught up in the moment doesnt see a stray backpack on the stairs in front of her
josie trips and the camera face plants into the pavement
george watches the monitor winces
the camera still faces the pavement
small im okay
josie is standing reading from her paper
sam is rapt
and so it is rosalind in disguise who is best able to see through the disguises of others
to say to phebe mistress know thy self to look at love from every angle and to realize finally that she is in love with orlando the bell rings
class is over
josie puts her stuff away and starts to follow the cool girls out
hey guys wait up the girls keep moving
sam stops josie
hey josie hold on
then youve been hiding something from me
oh i dont think so
its amazing josie
youre really talented
and far less depressing than dorothy parker
so what are you thinking for college
havent really thought about it
ill get you some applications
oh no no no no no
see my family we dont go to college
beat we just go right into sheep herding
josie you owe it to yourself to go
for your writing
youre a natural
thats really nice to hear
josie youre different
when you speak in class i can tell you actually feel the words touching heart in here
like eurdora welty talked about the word it moon
how for her it was like a concord grape
that grandpa took off his vine and gave to me to suck out of its skin it and swallow whole
they both take a breath in
look away from each other
george watches the monitor
anita sits on guss desk watches the last scene on guss tv engrossed
gus walks in and stops the tape
back to work
anita climbs off his desk
gus have you ever been in love
oh give it up gus
im just making conversation
who knows what that is
now circulation deadlines those i understand
you should go out every now and then gus with some new ties the girls would be all over you
gus stares down at his tie
but hes smiling a little
i have enough work here to last me all night
listen i dont have any plans you want some help
no roger from op ed
they share a smile
josie walks toward her locker the make out couple is at it again
josies fed up
she taps the boy on his shoulder
do you guys have some kind of schedule i could work around
he ignores josie and goes back to his girlfriend
aldys in her denominator sweatshirt decorated with pins approaches josie
hey wheres your sweatshirt
i uhh must have forgotten no biggie
i have an extra in my locker
ill get it for you
she starts to leave
oh i almost forgot ill see you tonight at big cup
josie looks confused
remember that poet that we liked the reading hes doing at big cup
i got us tickets
im late for lab
aldys takes off
josie looks down the hall where guy kristen and the others are all looking at a flyer pasted to the wall
that is gonna be such a sweet show
i am so there
guy looks at tommy and jason who f follow his lead
oh yeah man ill drive
its gonna be rufalicious
beat youre using it wrong
they head off en masse
josie goes and looks at the flyer jimmy cliff tonight at delloser hall
marquee reads jimmy cliff
a crowd has gathered by the door
josie gets out of cab and walks towards the club
josie enters the small smoky club
she wears what she considers to be her hip concert outfit an outfit that completely clashes with the rasta wear of the other concert goers
she reaches the bouncer
josie notices the two stoners from school standing behind her in line
i am not
i am only seventeen and i still attend high school
the bouncer stamps her hand
she looks down at her hand
we cu on her hand reading delloser
she enters as the two stoners approach the bouncer
two of you
a beat as the stoners look at each other realizing
to stoner oh dude and they run out of the club
jiiamy cliff is playing
the crowd sits at tables grooving
josie approaches the bar
a guy turns around its sam
josie out on a school night
a woman lara emerges from the crowd
and puts her arm around sam
an awkward beat
oh right sorry
to lara josies a student of mine
to josie laras my date
nice to meet you
another awkward pause
cmon cmon lets go dance
the crowd roars over cliffs next song as lara drags san off into the crowd
sam looks back briefly at josie as we lose him into the crowd
she sees guys group sitting at a table and approaches an empty seat
they immediately scoot around so that the seat is taken
undeterred josie sees a seat at the next table and sits down in it
she looks up to see that she is at a table of huge rastafarians
they all wear big rasta hats and even bigger hair and are smoking a joint the size of cuba
she smiles awkwardly
is it okay if i sit here
oh ya mon
we accept all peoples
we are all about da love
josie and the rastas start to groove to the music
josie looks over at guys table sees they are toking off a small joint and passing it around
george and his date a pam grier look alike sit close on the couch grooving to the concert playing on the monitor and through the various speakers
cu on the monitor
the joint the size of cuba is passed into frame
josies hand takes it
catching sight of this george and his date exchange concerned looks
josie is high beyond belief wearing a big rasta hat and loudly laughing her ass off as the rastas just stare
she can hardly keep herself in her chair
he was a firecracker
she lifts up rasta s dreadlocks to get his ear
contd yelling a firecracker
and she cracks up again
to rasta i dont love her
rastas share looks ill around
then josie hears the first strains of the harder they come contd oh my god
this music rules
and josie proceeds to get up and take over the place shes dancing on the table getting up with the band and playing the bongos all with absolutely no rhythm
but with a lot of whooping
the club is agog
angle on lara and sam
they both look aghast
shes a student of yours
in explanation shes from bali
and as josie continues to dance on stage making a total fool of herself jimmy cliff turns to camera
josie is on the phone and is in the process of finishing an entire pie
im telling you rob
i think i did it
im totally in
i was soo cool tonight
youd be so staring at fork you know whats a weird word
did i tell you about my new friends
i made friends with a whole table of rastafarians
not one a whole table
noting empty pie plate suddenly serious oh
someone ate my entire pie
josie is asleep where we left her her head on her hand empty pie plate nearby
she wakes picks her head up
looks down at her hand the delloser stamp is faint
close up on her forehead
there in block letters backwards is loser
she looks up at the clock which reads
she grabs her book bag and her keys and races out
josie strides confidently down the hallway loser prominently on her forehead
she sees guy and his group
they stare then snicker
the group laughs and joins in saying hey loser
josies face registers confusion
we move slowly down the packed hallway the camera shifting nervously amidst a sea of laughing kids
the laughter starts to echo
josie starts to walk quickly then run through the gauntlet of laughing and pointing kids
we hear the laughing the josie cam jerks frantically from kid to kid
this can not be good josie cam p
we hear josie breathing heavily as she runs past kids who all stare or laugh
she makes it to the girls room pushes open the door
josie goes to the sink splashes water on her face
george watches the monitor hands splash water
a hand grabs a paper towel
george can now see josie reflected in the bathroom mirror
he sees the loser stamp on her forehead
look up girl
cmon look up josie wipes her mouth
throws the towel away
goes to exit george is now apoplectic
josie pauses goes back to the mirror
she looks up
sees the stamp
her hand goes to her mouth in horror
she runs into a stall
josie cam p
we face the toilet
george looks at the monitor in amazement
a group is watching guss tv including bruns the hair plug man and howard arm casts
they are slack jawed in shock
we hear o
the sounds of josie vomiting
gus shakes his head sadly
its like the all humiliation network
they all nod in agreement
josie is in the fetal position on the floor of a stall
the den of josies parents home
josie is decked out
shes wearing a pretty hideous metallic pink dress matching gloves bag shoes
shes shining her braces using the t
screen as a mirror
the phone rings
josie grabs it
into phone hey billy
sure i can just wait for you on the front porch
see you in a uhh jiffer
she hangs up
sixteen year old rob very cute and buff enters
his pretty girlfriend is on his arm
mouthing to rob jiffer
rob just shrugs
josie in all her prom splendor waits out on the front porch for her date
she sees a long black limo turn the corner headed for the house
shes hopping up and down with excitement
she checks her reflection in her compact and then watches the limo approach
the sunroof of the limo opens and billy prince the adonis of the suburbs stands up sticking out of the sunroof
josie smiles and waves back
then another figure joins billys
its a gorgeous blonde in a slinky dress
shes standing up sticking out of the sunroof as well
josie looks a bit confused but still tries to smile
then she sees them holding things
little white things
before josie realizes whats going on her metallic ensemble is covered in dripping oozing eggs
one whacks her right in her trifocals
shouting hey write a poem about this
billy and his date lob a few more eggs and their limo roars off
josie stands on the porch alone
shes got egg in her hair on her face all over her dress everywhere
she starts to cry
softly at first moving into big loud wet sobs
she sits down on the porch her head in her hands and just keeps crying
homeroom has just gotten out and the halls are packed with kids
josie is running full speed trying to negotiate around lots of kids in her frantic race for the door
kids still point and stare
she bangs into some freshmen gets whacked by a book bag slides some banners that kids are painting but she wont slow down
just as shes almost at the doors to the school the big wooden door to the front office opens
josie cant stop
a figure emerges but before josie can even see who it is she slams into it and goes down
she bangs her head on the hard linoleum floor
homeroom has just gotten out and the halls are packed with kids
josie is running full speed trying to negotiate around lots of kids in her frantic race for the door
kids still point and stare
she bangs into some freshmen gets whacked by a book bag slides some banners that kids are painting but she wont slow down
just as shes almost at the doors to the school the big wooden door to the front office opens
josie cant stop
a figure emerges but before josie can even see who it is she slams into it and goes down
she bangs her head on the hard linoleum floor
we see two kids looking down into the camera
hey you okay
camera nods yes slowly
tommy and jason come into frame
you took a pretty big fall
like every loser should
and they move out of frame laughing
as every loser should
are you o
josie are you o
rob comes into frame
rob is bent over josie
she rubs her eyes
ive been in a horrible accident
this is a coma induced nightmare
josie this is real
she looks up
oh my god
beat what are you doing here
rob leans in and whispers to josie
i just registered
rob whips out his fake id and shows it to her
contd proudly manufactured at the tiki post
rob helps josie up
are you crazy
you cant do this
this is it jos
this is my ninth inning
the game isnt over i just thought it was
i get on the southglen baseball team the right scout sees me im into the minors its game time
youre twenty three years old
with the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old
plus im popular
you want to be popular
i can recognize a cry for help when i see one
then rob this is so like you
you know you cant just come in here and be popular in just one day
josie emerges from the cafeteria line with her tray
a loud chant comes from one of the tables
she turns to see rob in the middle of a hot dog eating contest with a huge wrestler
rob downs his last one raises his hands in victory
the crowd goes wild
rob sits down at guys table
oh my god
dude you rock
he high fives rob
a pretty girl tracy approached rob
im tracy and im sixteen and im a gymnast and i dont have a boyfriend
looks skyward mouths thank you
then to tracy im rob
hey where were you last night
i was worried
josie cant take her eyes off rob sitting at guys table
aldys notices josies distraction
i kept calling you but i only got your machine
i dont even know your parents line and i was really worried
aldys is really hurt
well maybe you should forget about sitting with us too
josie just stands there all alone
the girls head back to the locker room
josie lags behind the group and then wanders over to the baseball diamond where she hears a bunch of hoots and hollers
the team is practicing
rob has just hit a home run with three men on
everyone cheers him on as he runs the bases
as he comes into home he is met with congrats high fives
everyone loves him
josie watches the whole scene seething with jealousy
josie post shower is wrapped in a towel and carrying her sweaty gym clothes
a group of girls walk by her giggling as they exit
she approaches her locker and finds it ajar and completely empty
she looks from the empty locker down to the sweaty clothes in her hand
a realization sweeps over her face
josie shuffles down the hall still wearing her cheesy green and yellow gym clothes
she is clearly beaten
she looks down the hall stunned
it is ridiculous rob is being followed by a posse everyone knows his name
girls tug on his shirt guys slap him on the back or high five him
robster whats up
the rob man
my man rob
hi there robbie rob
josie sees guy approach rob and shake his hand
hey robo hows it going
nice pants man
they are rufus
josie looks like shes going to hurl
she looks down the hall the other way where a huge banner hangs that reads hey rob see you at the carnival later
josie looks on the wall next to her and sees a list oh please
josie has seen enough and walks on
establishing shot of a smallish carnival ferris wheel midway tea cups ride
near the entrance reads a banner southglen high senior night
aldys and the denominators stand in front of a booth that displays a large glass jar of jellybeans
calculators and paper out theyre engrossed in find the answer
josie walks by alone
the denominators dont notice her
we pan down the line of kids waiting to ride the ferris wheel
in front are tommy jason gibby and kirsten
this has been so much fun
weve been first in line for every ride
thats cuz we cut every line
we pan down to the end of the line where we find josie standing alone
shes trying her best to keep her game face on
the carny opens the gate the kids pile onto the ride two by two
josie reaches an empty car the last one and gets in
the carny holds the safety bar open
wheres your partner
i dont i dont have one yelling loudly to crowd do you have to yell like that
sam standing by a vendor looks over and notices josies predicament
of course its loser thats holding up the ride
sam walks up to the josies bucket
this seat taken
relieved thank you
he gets in
the ride jerks into motion
they start a slow ascent
sam seems ill at ease
are you scared
im gonna tell you something here and i hope it doesnt undermine my position as an authority figure
im a little afraid of heights
youre afraid of the ferris wheel
actually its more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me
the spiderman incident
touched you remember that story
i remember everything from your class
they smile at each other
the smile is interrupted by a heavy swaying of their bucket caused by tommy rocking in the bucket ahead
sam looks a little green
dont look down
theyre facing the ground at this point
out of my control
yelling to tommy tommy stops
sam turns to josie
contd defensive i said that as a chaperone
they start to ascend again
sam contd okay this is okay
then can i ask you something
do you think i tell too many stories in class
thats what makes you interesting
beat recovering as a teacher
god i would love to think im an interesting teacher
i mean i had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all
in the classroom
you have to say that
youre my student
i dont have to say that
they look into each others eyes just as tommy rattles his bucket ruthlessly
josie and sam laugh uncomfortably
id like to tell you that we all grow out of it but thats a lie
some of us will always be rattling cages
why do you do that
i dont know
and you know whats scary when you get older it just gets more confusing
ive spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me
beat you know what i shouldnt be talking about this stuff with you
its nice to have someone to talk to the bucket is rocked again by tommy sam grips the safety bar
as he rocks same here
they stop rocking but theyre still stuck at the top
sam contd all i can tell you is that when youre my age the guys will be lined up around the block for you
they share a smile
suddenly shy you have to say that
youre my teacher
i shouldnt say that because im your teacher
they look at each other their smiles fading into realization
suddenly the car jerks and they start to move down
josie and sam are pulled out of their reverie
they smile awkwardly at each other and laugh a small laugh
wide shot of the ferris wheel as josie and sam descend
this wasnt as bad as i thought
when are you going to open your eyes
im thinking when im home
rob sits with a bunch of baseball players
matz and packer the studs of the team come into the dugout and join them
packer hey rob thanks for showing me that new grip

out of the corner of his eye rob sees josie walking alone across the field
he gets an idea

theres no accent aigue so the e is soft
a silent beat
josie thinks she may have blown it
duh of course you would know that
from being on your yacht in the south of france
they all smile at her
josie soaks in her newfound popularity
on the walls are safe sex posters
on the front desk pamphlets on sexually transmitted diseases share space with plastic biology cross section models of male and female reproductive organs
sam stands in front of his english class impatiently looking at his watch
josie looks up from her desk sees anita waving wildly from the other side of the glass door
josies eyes widen she starts to make get out of here movements
sam notices josie and follows her gaze to anita
he opens the door speaks sotto to anita
youre here for the sex talk
happily taken aback well
i like a man who gets to the point
frisky if you say so
sam turns to the class
welcome juniors and seniors this is pam kitterman
shes our district health counselor
shes here to lead our sex discussion
he ushers a surprised anita to the front of the room
oh i am
yes well sex

sometimes he doesnt
anita leans into josie talks sotto
anita contd whispering hi
also whispering what are you doing here
i had a lunch break so i thought id come by and see you
your teacher is a fox
then normal voice to josie
why dont we discuss that after class
but the burning is totally normal
looking at watch oh look

i thought this was a minute seminar
anita walks back to the front of the classroom
anita contd okay sex
sex is really fun
off josies look when youre old enough
which none of you are trust me i should know cuz when you lose it to some guy named junior with really bad breath in the back of a van
at a guns and roses concert youre gonna wish you listened to your mom when she said yknow no ones gonna want to buy the whole friggin ice cream truck when youre handing out the popsicles for free
theres a deafening silence
the kids are amazed
anita contd okay
the kids all have bananas and condoms
they are in various stages of putting the condom over the banana
anita walks among them clearly more comfortable with her role now
i know its hard
titters from the group
anita contd difficult
but safe sex is really important
i try to practice it every day
angle on kirsten kristen
their condoms are snugly on their bananas
they stare at josie
do you really think she hooked up with our rob
theyre so different
sometimes opposites attract
look at bert and ernie
we angle on anita
shes walking authoritatively up the aisle towards the front
imagine the bananas are the real thing
she takes a rather large banana off a desk and looks at it
anita contd in a land called every mans fantasy
she looks up sees the real miss kitterman we can tell from the model of a uterus she carries standing outside the door and waving
without missing a beat anita pulls down a shade on the door and locks it
angle on josie and tracy still struggling with condoms
god i cant do this
maybe because were not supposed to be having sex with bananas
you know what though
i feel like im really ready to do it
to have sex for the first time
i mean sex is a really big deal
you shouldnt do it until you know youve found the right person
angle on sam listening
josie is oblivious
contd you know adele penguins pick one mate
they spend their whole life looking for that one other penguin and when they find it they know
thats the penguin they stay with for the rest of their lives
but im not a penguin
its an analogy
a surprised josie looks up to see sam next to her
she lets her condom go
and it flies off her banana into his face
josie turns to tracy
i have to go die now
the class is interrupted by sydney over the loudspeaker over speaker hey guys sydney again
dont forget no going into the library cuz of that little asbestos problem
and about prom everyone freezes
sydney contd really bad news
we just got the word from intelligence northglen high is doing the millennium too
a girl faints
sera squeezes her banana so hard it oozes out of its skin
other kids are beating their bananas against desktops
brett the football player absentmindedly peels his banana and begins eating it
all right guys lets calm down
no response sit
they all do including anita
sam contd now look
we need a new idea
how about under the sea
shes met with a round of boos
anita contd well excuse me
what about the roaring twenties
or the s
the class lets out a giant groan on that one
what do you think we are
thats not a theme
no josie will have the answer
a long beat
expectant faces all turn to josie
she looks at tracy
how about coming to her meant for each other famous couples throughout history
another beat as the class considers
smiles and nods yeah
the class suddenly concurs
josie soaks in all the approval like a sponge
josie looks from sam and anitas smiling faces to find guy smiling at her
close up on a banner reading millennium
it comes down replaced by one that reads meant for each other
widen to reveal josie and the cool girls walk under the banner laughing
we pan up to their lapels and see that they are all wearing replicas of josie s geeky airplane pin
they pass aldys josie is oblivious
josie and the girls walk four abreast like a pack of proud lions
kids part to let them through
workers look at their watches run into guss office
sam and josie have fun painting a backdrop of the sunset
workers stand around guss tv riveted by josie and sam
josie and the girls try on lipstick laughing and fooling around
josie and sam pick out cds from a djs case
josie picks one out and puts it in the yes pile
sam picks it up wrinkles his nose puts it back
when he looks away josie sneaks it back
josies hiding behind a rack of clothes talking on her cell phone
into phone im telling you gus
its a great story
they keep the tags on then return the clothes after theyve worn them
kirsten discovers josie behind the rack
josie quickly pulls a cardigan off a rack feigning interest in it
the girls all do the same
josie and the girls wearing matching cardigans walk past aldys and another denominator on their way to the escalator
josie and aldys lock eyes and josie smiles but aldys turns her back to her
to denominator look there goes another lemming
we angle on the escalator as josie and the girls rise single file out of frame
josie sits with her new friends emulating them by sunning in a bikini top and shorts while they watch the game
josie you have totally transitioned
you crossed over
into our group
its really hard to do
some kids try for all of high school and never make it
kirsten transitioned last year
her dad sold a car to leonardo di caprios uncle and before he picked it up her dad let us all sit in it and take pictures
to josie wait
do you know any gay guys
wed love to transition a gay guy into the group
were very evolved
a ball sails fast and hard
it looks like its going to be a base hit into left field but the shortstop leaps up and grabs it
that shortstop is rob
the team cheers
coach romano heads out of the dugout towards rob
josie and the gang leap up and cheer
josie almost loses her top but catches it just as guy comes around the side of the stands and notices josie
coach romano approaches rob
slaps him on the back
great playing rob
you might be just what southglen south needs to get to nationals
im playing in the championship game
youre starting shortstop
and i dont mean to put more pressure on you but there are going to be some pro scouts there
rob grabs coach romano in a bear hug
the coach is uncomfortable
rob moves towards the dugout and the coach happily slaps him on the ass
josie and the girls are leaving
guy catches up to them and taps josie on the shoulder
so you going to the party at robs
josies taken aback
the girls notice guys interest
yeah you gonna be there
josie stumbles on a step guy immediately reaches out to steady her
she cant even speak so she just nods
ill see you tonight
guy walks off
he is totally crunching on you
confused do i want to be crunched
camera pans the faces of some dull looking workers
it stops on josie who stands out in her teen garb and huge knapsack
a star struck female worker turns to her
i really loved you in the sex ed scene
josie spills out the elevator and races through the bullpen with rhoda in pursuit
splendiferous josie stops turns back to her
josie keeps going
a confused rhoda stares after her
she passes merkins desk
he is still on the phone
into phone no way
josie reaches over grabs the phone out of his hand and hangs up without missing a beat
she continues on as merkin stares after her
josie reaches the conference room door
an older woman runs out crying
rigfort presides over a staff meeting
close up on stunned office workers faces
alrighty then next on the agenda sack races at the company picnic yes or no
josie sneaks in
she pushes past workers to get to a chair big backpack whacking them as she goes

oh and if you dont you and gus are fired
josie and gus react
contd now onto the next order of business
marketing department yes or no
beer cans and kids litter the lawn
josie pulls into the driveway
josie makes her way through the throngs of kids
its a big high school rager lots of big blue keg cups drunk girls etc
the cool girls are present and socializing
josie finally makes her way to the kitchen
rob is mixing margaritas wearing a big sombrero
tracy sits on the counter gazing lovingly at robs every move
hey rob whats going on

josie glares at rob
pulling rob aside rob that girl is sixteen

josie feels an arm around her shoulder

josie turns around and gives him a death look
tracy turns to rob
rob what do you want to be when you grow up

tracy starts to giggle
rob does not
guy and josie stand in front of josies old room
a bicycle license plate that says josie is nailed to the door
she stands in front of it
maybe we should go in a different room
i already checked
there are some pretty serious couples in there
guy reaches for the doorknob
they go in
josie sees her spelling bee trophies with her name
she turns them around trying to appear nonchalant
as guy enters he eyes the trophies the stuffed animals the many sets of encyclopedias
wow robs sister must be such a loser
josie manages a weak smile
guy sits on the bed
come here sit down
she sits on the bed and then sees a picture of her and her family on the bedside table
she dives across the bed to overturn it
im sure youve probably heard that i want to ask you but id like to know if youd go to prom with me
i know we didnt hit it off right at the beginning but yes
guy leans in as if to kiss her and whispers
then pulling away but i dont even know where you live
you know what
why dont you just pick me up here
we could all share a limo
ill catch you later
josie is ecstatic and flops back on her bed
stuffed animals fall all around her
josie and rob walk confidently through the hallway
kids greet and high five them both
looking good guys
rob rufus kegger
rob and josie turn the corner
rob this is unbelievable
i mean josie shoves through the double doors leading into the gym
the place is a flurry of activity a staging area for prom
various committees are set up at tables throughout the room
josie and rob enter
i spent my whole life wanting to fit in and now gibby and kirsten run up to josie
hey josie who did archie date betty or veronica
gibby turns to kirsten
and they move off
rob spots tracy and moves off to her
i always liked betty better
josie turns sees sam
and they begin to walk through the prom prop area and it begins to appear like a romantic date they pass flowers he picks one out they pass a bistro
table a backdrop of a sunset follows them for awhile etc
betty was so spunky and fun
veronica may have had great legs but she was too moody
very high maintenance
angle on a table where kristen and tommy are selling prom tickets
aldys is standing in front of them
you cant not sell me a ticket to prom

sera turns off
youre really doing a great job here josie

tweedle dum and tweedle dee
maybe distant cousins
they did have that egg shape in common
but humpty dumpty was alone
thats sad isnt it
he had to sit on that wall all by himself
he deserved to have somebody
thats really what we all need right
someone to sit up on the wall with us yeah
to watch the world go by
to put us back together again when we fall
they share a meaningful glance and a smile
our penguin right

yeah actually i do
they are lost in each other
they lean closer as if they may kiss then sam breaks the moment
oh my god
i almost forgot i got you a meeting with the admissions guy from dartmouth
but i wasnt even going to go to college no i know but i pulled some strings got him to look at your writing and he agreed to meet you
i told him teasing if im wrong about this girl you can take away my teaching certificate
you believe in me that much of course i do
josie you owe it to yourself to your writing to go to college
youre a great writer
you just have to find your story
as they share a meaningful look we freeze frame
gus and josie sit in front of his tv
the image of sam and josie is frozen on the screen
thats your story
i cant i cant no
its got it all sex intrigue immorality in the education system hes my teacher
and thats the best part
bannering with his hands teacher student relations how close is too close
were gonna blow the lid off it
there is no lid
nothings going on between sam and me
sam coulson and me
every person in this office comes in here and watches you guys
its like the goddamn young and the restless
rigforts salivating over it
you already pitched this to rigfort
gus leans in now all business
josie this isnt a joke
you heard rigfort
its both of our asses on the line
this is your story
josie is getting ready for prom
she wears her bathrobe and is doing her make up
she looks over at her dresser where she eyes the camera flight wings pin tentatively
rob in boxers a dress shirt and socks is filling flasks with vodka
josie comes in the door wearing a lovely elizabethan gown
she looks absolutely beautiful
wow josie you look really hopeful rufus
and what are duh
he puts on his black wayfarer sunglasses and does the famous slide into the living room
this is really happening
i never thought i know
rob smiles and exits
josie nervously checks her reflection in the t
just like she did eight years ago
she takes a deep breath and goes out
josie comes out on the porch and sees the limo rounding the corner just like eight years before
the sunroof opens
and guy stands up holding something
josie panics and starts to take cover but then sees hes holding a dozen white roses
and holding them out to her
come on beautiful what are you waiting for
josie smiling runs down the driveway to the limo
and it really is magical
twinkling lights dot the trees music wafts out from the club
a neon sign that says meant for each other blinks above the building
couples make their way inside
we see mork a mindy antony a cleopatra and sera dressed as a rabbit
annoyed she turns back to her lagging date brett dressed as a tortoise
if you dont hurry up were gonna miss the whole thing
gibby kirsten and kristen exit limos with their dates
they all wear the same straight blonde wig and look at each other in horror
oh my god

josie and guy approach dressed in elizabethan costume
they look great
josie you look rufus

rosalind and orlando
nothing from as you like it
more blank stares shakespeare
its like talking to a sack of hammers
i get to have a sword
and they all ooh and ahh
we follow josie and the group into the prom
the place looks amazing
lights ice sculptures champagne fountains
we pan down the buffet
a boy dressed as a jar of peanut butter and his date jelly are getting food
peanut butter turns away from the buffet and bumps into a girl dressed as a chocolate bar
theres a magical beat as they smile at each other
thats okay jelly looks on chagrined
we reach two older gentlemen in tuxes who carry clipboards and wear big buttons that read national prom judge
they contemplate the ice sculpture
its deft and unique without being derivative
looking off hey
pigs in blankets
and he runs off
josie sits with the cool group at a table
kristen is making odd faces
kristen what are you doing
im practicing my surprised face for when we get named to prom court
joseph and a very pregnant mary approach their table and try to sit down
theres no room at this table
joseph and mary amble off
guy turns to josie

josie takes in the spectacle around her
candles are lit
georges date sits on the couch
the monitor is on showing the josie cam pov
he flips the switch the lights dim and a small disco ball starts moving slowly
george settles in next to his date
the entire office is crammed into guss office
anita sits up front spellbound watching the josie cam

merkin holds out a bowl of cash
contd josies odds are to

we pan across the dance floor where we see popeye olive oyl sonny cher the blues brothers
we hold on robin dancing with batgirl
batman approached and taps robins shoulder may i have this dance and batgirl steps aside robin and batman dance happily away
angle on rob trying to slow dance with tracy dressed like rebecca de mornay but she is so drunk shes having trouble balancing

he tries to stand her up on her own
gibby gave me champagne
maybe we should sit

next to them a ravenous miss piggy eats with her date kermit looking on
she picks up an hors doeuvre and stares at it horrified
oh my god

he looks around
its high school prom
a skinny kid is getting beat up in a corner
other kids are sneaking smokes

and then i think we should get back out on that dance floor and boogie
rob gets up kisses tracy on the top of her head and heads for the refreshment table
tracy her leg still around her head falls backwards into kermits lap
kermit looks down surprised and interested
miss piggy notices gives him a big harumph tosses her hair and leaves
gibby is staring o

beat did i say that out loud
we follow kristens stare to the prom entrance where aldys and the denominators enter in pairs one behind the other attached together with rope to form a human ladder
they cross the dance floor interrupting everything with their unwieldy tied together conga line
they approach the cool table
so what are you supposed to be
other than freaks
a double helix
but i guess youd know that if youd actually passed bio
kristen reaches out and touches the rope binding denominator to aldys
denominator slaps her hand away
please dont touch the hydrogen
sam takes the stage with a card in his hand
well the moment has arrived
he looks at the card
our prom court the princesses are miss kristen rey miss kirsten leosis and miss gibby zarefsky

josie stands by the buffet in her tiara turns and comes face to face with sam
theyre both taken aback by the others beauty
josie you make a really beautiful prom queen

they both laugh embarrassed at josies flub
i always feel like such a goofball in these penguin suits

guy approaches aldys
hey listen its prom

aldys cant help it
she smiles a little flattered
contd if its okay with the rest of the double helix
aldys smiles and unhooks herself from the group
and starts to dance with guy
angle on josie and sam as they continue to dance
proms always make me sad

sam smiles at this

close up on josies hand as she subtlety removes her hidden camera pin and drops it to the ground
contd theres something i have to tell you her foot comes down on top of it
george is making out with his date when the monitor suddenly fritzes off
george looks up
george stands and hits the side of the monitor
guss monitor flicks to static
the crowd lets out a horrified gasp

sam looks deep into josies eyes
theres something i have to tell you too josies eyes shift from sam to over his shoulder
she spots aldys who smiles at her
josies eyes travel up to the can of dog food
on the porch facing billy and his date
with egg dripping all over her
slow motion as josie lunges for aldys and pulls her to floor as tommy off balance dumps the dog food all down guys front
the crowd stops dead staring
the can now empty rolls slowly off the dance floor the metal rolling noise echoing in the silence
to josie what is your problem
i knew it
you are a loser
you ruined the whole thing
you so do not deserve to be prom queen
everyone is still staring
its dead quiet
let me tell you something
it is still silent
josie takes a deep breath and looks around the room
contd i dont care about being the prom queen
i am twenty five years old
looks of confusion and teenage disgust
rob is pissed
sam looks shocked
contd im here as an undercover reporter for the sun times for gods sake and ive been beating my brains out trying to impress you
she tears off her crown and chucks it
shes on a roll
contd i want to tell you something
you people guy gibby the rest of you who have been keeping the geeks down through the ages
you will spend your lives trying to figure out ways to keep others down because it makes you feel more important
and you will miss out on so much
indicating aldys why her huh
what did she ever do to you
let me tell you something about this girl
she is unbelievable
i was new here and she befriended me no questions asked
but you people you were my friends only after my brother rob
she points out rob in the crowd
contd posed as a student and told you to like me
but yknow l have to thank you
i got to go to an amazing prom
i got to be prom queen
i got to be cool
it felt good
beat but not as good as being myself
turns to crowd and to all of you theres a big world out there
bigger than prom
bigger than high school
when you get there it wont matter if you were prom queen or the quarterback or the biggest nerd in school
what matters is that you dont regret who you were who you are what if steven spielberg had quit the audio visual club because it wasnt cool
what if rosie odonnell had stopped cracking jokes because someone told her they were stupid
what if michael jordan never went back to basketball after he got cut from his high school team
a beat in this room right now there could be a future nobel prize winner a supreme court justice an amazing mom
find out who you are and dont be afraid of it
a beat and if youll all excuse me i have some business to take care of
reaction shots all around
kids start clapping hollering whooping
the music starts up again
they all go back to dancing the denominators lead their own conga line
she looks around for sam but he is gone
she runs out brushing past the judges
judge dabs his eyes
this prom had it all
laughter tears an amazing climax
judge still overcome just raises his two thumbs up
josie exits the club looking for sam
george runs up to her
hey i lost the feed
what happened with coulson
gus is going crazy
out of the shadows emerges sam
the look on his face says he just heard everything
he shakes his head in disbelief and walks off
josie chases after him
he turns back to her
you were doing a story on me
no surprise i thought youd be what
because it turns out all along that i was allowed to be attracted to you
touched you were attracted to me
drop the act
do you have any idea what i went through every night because of you
i was attracted to a year old
when i wasnt taking cold showers i was trying to figure out what the hell i was going to do when i couldnt teach anymore
i thought i was the one being unethical
wait i was going to tell you you set me up
for a story
beat you know whats crazy
i was actually considering waiting for you
but now you dont have to now i dont want to
i bought all of your penguin crap
i thought i found her the right one
and the problem was she was too young
no the problem was she didnt even exist
i did exist
i do exist
im the same person
the person i cared about wouldnt have done this
everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie
i dont know you at all
for all i know you could hate dorothy parker
look you could get to know me again
sam turns and starts to walk away
please dont walk away
i just cant look at you the same way
sam gets into his car and drives off
josie is devastated
josie still in the prom dress rounds the corner of her apartment hallway and sees rob still in his risky business get up slumped in front of the door
i just wanted to come over and make sure youre okay
he gets up
hes not happy
no not really josie
how could you do that to me
i helped you
i got you everything you wanted
and how do you repay me you blow everything two days before pro scouts come to see me play
once they had seen me really play they wouldnt have given a shit about my age
i wasnt even thinking about no you werent
dont you realize the only time i was really happy in the last five years was when i was playing ball with those guys
no shut up josie
just shut up
he storms off
josie lies amidst the needlepoint pillows still in her prom costume
she stares blankly at the ceiling
gus slaps a newspaper down on his desk
close on the front page of the paper and not just any newspaper the chicago tribune the sun times rival
there is a photo of josie from prom with the headline that reads reporter revealed at local high school
josie picks it up and starts reading
your story was rigforts baby
we were scooped
weve got nothing
you totally and completely screwed both of us
maybe i could talk to rigfort you know tell him the whole story
ill tell you a story
its about this shy copy editor who makes a mockery of herself and her boss when she completely botches her first assignment as a reporter
slams down the paper
we are not screwed
yes i made a mistake
but we will have a story
beat you will have an amazing story
josie walks out of guss office continues determined towards the elevators
anita falls into step with her
josie howd it go
did he ream you
yeah but im okay
ive got some work to do
you need my help
no thanks im doing this on my own
josie walks past merkins desk
she holds out her hand to merkin
merkin slaps a highlighter into her hand she continues on
anita watches her go
josie looking quite the professional in stylish pantsuit and briefcase bounds up the steps two at a time
josie walks down the hall purposefully she is on a mission
groups of kids stop and stare at her but this time josie doesnt even notice
as josie rounds a corner she comes face to face with guy who is at his locker
he looks at her
and now it is guy that is nervous
he drops a pile of papers tries awkwardly to gather them
josie looks at him and for the first time we see it register on her face this guy is just a seventeen year old kid
uh hey umm ms
this is totally embarrassing but my mom shes all worried about me getting a job after graduation
she wanted me to ask you about like an internship for me at the sun times
josie smiles big
ill do what i can
and tell your mom not to worry youll do o
josie continues down the hall
the guys locker room
a bunch of guys are getting dressed after p
and with that josie comes walking into the locker room completely unruffled and storms over to coach romanos office just as he is leaving it
hi coach romano my name is josie geller from the chicago sun times listen you know the local sports guy for the sun times jim lakin
sure every coach in the area tries to get jim to cover his team
josie puts her arm around the coach and leads him back into his own office
well what would you say if i told you that i could guarantee that jim and every other reporter in the area would be at the game
id say you can have whatever the hell you want
josie smiles together they enter his office and close the door
josie sits at her disk typing on her laptop engrossed
someone once told me that to write well you have to write what you know
this is what i know
i am twenty five years old
i have never really kissed a guy
a geek to the core most of my childhood years were spent doing extra homework i requested from the teacher
gus comes in snaps on the light sits at his desk and opens his newspaper
he pulls out the life and style section
and there it is
front page never been kissed by josie geller
there are three pictures next to the article
one is josie at age one is her recent prom picture and one is her as a normal yr
high school was more of the same
then at seventeen it seemed as if my luck was about to change
the cutest guy in school asked me to senior prom but it turned out he invited me as a cruel joke
i have never fully recovered
anita and cynthia read the article in the staff lunch room over a shared bag of microwave popcorn
they are astounded yes it is embarrassing to share this with the world
but it would be hard to explain what i learned and how i learned it without sharing this humiliating history
the sun times lies on the front mat
the door opens we see a pair of bare feet
a hand reaches down to grab the paper
we pan up to reveal sam in all his depressed glory sweats unshaven bleary eyed
i received an assignment my first as a reporter to enroll in high school as a student to gain some insight into kids today
understandably returning to high school was my worst nightmare
sam shuts the door
kids stream into school
what i found
knox wearing the sombrero teaches her class
theres still that one teacher who marches to her own drummer and in the back row kirsten kristen and gibby are laughing an talking those girls are still there
the ones that even as you grow up will still be the most beautiful girls that youve ever seen close up
the baseball team as they practice the athletes and the immense sense of fraternity and loyalty that they share aldys and the denominators making smores over a bunson burner getting
into a melted chocolate and marshmallow fight and laughing hysterically the smart kids
who everyone else always knew as the brains
but who i just knew as my soulmates my teachers my friends
guy tommy and jason as they get out guys car in the parking lot and theres still that one guy the one who is so perfect in every way from
the muscles in his shoulders we focus in on guy as he takes the front steps two at a time to the way he in his own way struggles to uphold tradition
southglen would not have been the same without him
high school would not be the same without him
i would not have been the same without him
guy his buddies kirsten kristen and gibby sign yearbooks hang out by the lockers all of these things made me miserable at seventeen
but at twenty five i finally see that this all of this is just the way it should be
it is all part of this thing high school
a time in our lives that we can never truly repeat
a time that shapes us
a time that makes us who we are for years to come
hands grab chicago sun times at the newsstand high school going through it the first time helped make me who i am
but going there a second time made me see that who i am is o
i always wanted to be in but seven years later when they finally opened the door i somehow gained the confidence to stay outside firmly happily
about of the people have their life and style sections opened reading josies piece
this is not the article i was sent in to write
this is the article i needed to write
i lived a lifetime of regret after my first high school experience and now after my second my regrets are down to one
the kitchen of a depressed guy empty pizza boxes next to a dying plant
sam pours milk into a bowl of lucky charms while he reads the sports section of the paper
a certain teacher was trampled in my path to self discovery and though this article may serve as a step it in no way makes up for what i did
hes not paying attention and the milk overflows the bowl soaking the table
contd to this man you know who you are i am so sorry
he takes the wet paper using it like a sponge he sops up the remaining milk and throws the paper into an open trash can
he leaves the kitchen
we hold on the empty room
contd and i would like to add one more thing i think i am in love with you
cars begin to fill the parking lot in a steady stream
and so i propose this as an ending to this article and perhaps as an ending to this portion of my life
i josie geller will be at the state championship baseball game where my friends the southglen rams are playing for the title
the southglen rams baseball team minus rob are on the field warming up
i will stand on the pitchers mound for the five minutes prior to the first pitch
if this man accepts my apology i ask him to come to kiss me in front of everyone for my first real kiss
we find a nervous looking josie standing in the dugout
contd five minutes may seem like a short time but trust me when youve been waiting twenty five years its usually the last five minutes that kill you
i went back to high school and discovered i was a loser again
widen to reveal the picture on the fridge in sam enters still in sweats carrying a book
he opens the fridge grabs a beer shuts it is confronted by josies picture
he takes it down looks at it
contd and then i discovered it wasnt so bad
i wasnt so bad
so now that im ready to start living the rest of my life it would be magical if i could live the rest of it with him
sam lets the photo slowly drop from his hand into the trash
contd because inside everyone is a loser afraid to be loved and out there is the one person who can kiss us and make it all better
we follow sams stare down into the trash and see the photo lying on top and to the side of josies article the photos from the article are clearly visible
angle on hot dogs popcorn changing hands being sold by the truckload at the stadium
the crowds are over capacity
people fill the parking lot they cover every other inch of school grounds as well
they stand on the roofs of nearby buildings they sit on top of their cars
it looks like most of chicago is either already there or on their way
some women hold signs for josie others hold and wave her article
josie sticks her head out of the dugout and looks out at the fans
tv reporters are everywhere including several on the field
she looks like she may faint
she ducks back in
the team is dressed ready excited
anita and aldys stand next to josie
josie looks up at the crowd amazed
theyre behind you
they feel like they know you
its romantic what youre doing and they want to be a part of it
well im so glad that you guys are
josie then starts to hyperventilate
she puts her head between her ankles
anita and aldys both grab the brown paper bag and hand it to josie
she hyperventilates into it
coach romano approaches
josie puts the bag down
sweet jesus geller i had no idea thered be all these tv crews here
this things gonna be on every station in the country
josie immediately begins hyperventilating into the bag again
you more than kept your end of the bargain
now go out there and get em
josie gets up and he slaps her on the ass
she hugs aldys
then anita gives josie a big hug and wont let go
josie has to pull anita pulls back
josie struggles to get out of the hug anita wont let her
finally they are both laughing
josie walks out of the dugout and onto the field
she walks alone out to the pitchers mound clutching a microphone
the crowd goes berserk
she stands until they quiet
could i have five minutes on the clock please
the scoreboard clock reads
josie stands alone
the staff from the sun times sits in box seats up front
rigfort joins them carrying a huge load of hot dogs
i got weiners
rigfort sits next to gus
behind them sit bruns his hair finally growing in and howard now down to just a sling
i love this
sun times readers out here making a personal connection to one of our reporters
this is amazing isnt it
gus takes a weiner
yeah it is
studying his weiner wait a minute
rigfort pulls something small and shiny out of the bun
contd theres a bolt in my weiner
then he turns back to howard and smiles
contd hey howard what are you doing for the next month
howards face falls
josie still stands there
the clock is down to
she looks over to the dugout
the denominators talking and laughing
behind them sit the marching band josie forces a stoic smile
is on the clock
the cool crowd
guy kirsten and the gang
they are trying start the wave but its not working
the clock reads
the sun times box
anita clutches guss hand for dear life has her eyes squeezed tight
the crowd keeps chanting
everyone including all the denominators are on their feet chanting
aldys cheers the loudest
the women are on their feet chanting
guy and the gang are on their feet
josie stands clutching the mic
the clock reads
josie stands there head still held high
josie steals a look to the dugout
no one is coming out the door
josie makes one more desperate look around
no one is running toward her
close up on josie completely crestfallen
she drops the microphone
it reverbs in the silent stadium
we pan across the crowd all defeated
a commotion in the stands
sam bursts through the crowd
he runs toward the mound
the crowd is on their feet
it feels like a lifetime before he reaches josie grabs her pulls her close to him
i told you you could write josie geller
i finally found my story
and they kiss passionately
the most amazing most waited for kiss in the history of man
a kiss that will last forever
rob is in his baseball uniform cheering up a storm
across his chest is emblazoned assistant coach
anita is so thrilled she reaches over and plants a big one on gus
she is surprised
so is he
they like it
the denominators and aldys cheer their brains out
guy kirsten etc
have finally succeeded in starting the wave
music up the beach boys and then i kissed her as josie and sam continue to kiss as the camera pulls up taking in the kiss the crowd the stadium
camera spins up as fireworks go off above the stadium
and we watch as the stadium becomes a speck against the glittering backdrop of chicago
