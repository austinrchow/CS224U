written by peter baynham a homeless man who from his tatty suit may have been a top broker this time last year is picking through a bin in manhattans deserted
night time financial district
the street starts to vibrate
a terrifying growl approaches
a huge black shape smashes into view the dark knights batmobile
our audience wonder if theyve wandered into the wrong movie
the homeless man dives for cover
the batmobile smashes into a row of parked cars
we hear manic laughing from inside the car which screeches and careers violently into a sign reading wall street
sirens herald three police cars in hot pursuit
the batmobile roars up wall street bashing against the new york stock exchange thumping up and down the federal halls steps and finally smashing at high speed into the rear
end of the famous charging bull statue
two enormous bronze testicles thud onto the batmobiles bonnet and roll away
the cop cars screech up surrounding the batmobile
two older cops and a rookie surround it weapons drawn
a helicopter appears blazing the batmobile in white light
an older cop flashes the rookie a dirty look then points a flashlight into a tiny window
the batman actually drunken english socialite arthur bach templemead in a costume lowers the window and offers a handshake
seen it all before hi arthur
are you familiar with the expression i can explain everything
out of the car please
terribly sorry but in the film they used a different model to show the old batchap getting in and out
this one has no doors so id have to squeeze out the back arsehole first
which nobody wants
apart from you cheeky monkey
its a joke
arthur wriggles awkwardly out of a rear hatch
the bronze bull teeters a little scarily
he stands wobbly
his batman utility belt features a big water pistol a firework a hip flask and line of shot glasses
and inexplicably a big red stapler
the younger cop is desperately fighting the giggles
okay explain everything
what with having spunked
million fat alberts on this little runaround i thought why not take it a step further and try to actually collar a few ne er do wells
it worked for the billionaire bruce wayne why not the future billionaire arthur bach templemead
will i have to do traffic school
how much have you drunk arthur
to use the technical medical term megabloodyshitloads
either that or ive had a stroke
but fret not i have a designated driver
the cop shines his flashlight back inside revealing a bearded homeless old man in a crappy s robin costume
wheres my five thousand dollars
arthur counts out a huge wad of cash
the boy homeless here neglected to say hed never driven
or that the only reason hes sober is to be ready for the conspiracy of leopards about to seize manhattan
arthur hands another wad of cash to cop
i trust this will cover all repairs to new york and any inconvenience to your good selves
he turns and tries to get back in
up up and away
ah no thats the other chap
the bronze bull collapses fully crushing the batmobile
arthur sits minus mask in a cell with homeless robin and various criminals and drunks including a huge guy in a chicago cubs shirt sporting a terrifically swollen eye
jay a drunk with a bandaged neck is ranting away at arthur whos paying close attention genuinely fascinated
cash sticks out of various pockets
then the crazy motherfucker cut me
said i cut the bombita with pig killer
and who threw hot americano in whose face again
i did in his
no half and half neither
that shit burnt
jay laughs hard as does gary another crook
arthur out of politeness tries to join in the laughter
i burnt my sisters hair
high fiving him cool
ho wanted to evict me just cause i dont fit her definition of hygiene
plenty of places to take a shit toilets just one of them
just ask the a rabs
its like a chat show this
looking into an imaginary its been said of my next guest by jay the bandaged lunatic that shes a sick ass whacked out whacked up asswipe
to a prostitute carmella when did you first dream of becoming a crack whore
mother died when i was six
oh g d i hate when that happens
my father raped me when i was twelve
sounds like you had six relatively good years
what do you do
i model riding boots i spend money i sleep with women
but i have weekends off and i am my own boss
the cell door swings open
hey the drunk knight
your fairy g d lawyers here
i never thought new yorks underbelly could be quite such agreeable company
i shall never forget you
the crooks look back at him sulkily
arthur looks guilty
arthurs attorney elverton devere is leaving with him
i dont think your mother will be pleased arthur
really elverton if a chap cant help out a few chums whatever their station in life
the other crooks from the cell are leaving alongside them
each has given his or her word to put the criminal life behind them
arthur steps into a blaze of paparazzi flashes
i am the batman
gotham can sleep easy tonight
points at a cameraman dont point that shit at me bitch
i will fuck you up
jay attacks the cameraman violently
gary piles in
kill the lizards
arthur pushes past the press
what will your mother say
didnt she send you here to get you out of the british papers
he turns to those crooks who arent fighting
anyone need a job
my last driver resigned after i filled his limo with squirrels
preferably sober clean driving licence
the crooks all look unsure
apart from one
a different extremely flashy car zips through central park the back full of released crooks the huge chicago guy his names marty at the wheel
the car passes a male jogger
it stops and backs up
arthur opens a door and beckons the jogger offering champagne
the jogger gets in
the car sets off again
anyone know a good bar
the car pulls up outside a very rough looking dive club
out falls arthur laughing his head off along with champagne bottles footballs and rich boys toys
following him are his crook friends the jogger two middle aged tourists and a dancing man in a leotard twirling a big sign reading cheap like the pied piper arthur
leads his disciples into the bar
arthur staggers out leading a bigger crowd
in a conga
hes even more drunk arm in arm with carmella the prostitute and a very attractive young woman sofia
he produces a big stand back
he releases the firework it flies at a crazy drunk angle people screaming and diving for cover
it explodes into a shop sign reading checks cashed
nobody tell you about the recession
a very long line of excited people stand at an atm arthur at the front
roll up roll up folks lets fix this thing right now
to his first customer how much sir
coming right up
keys it in fries with that
the man laughs along with others in the line including sofia who catches his eye
the arthur dials a number on his gold iphone
arthur bach templemead
can you squeeze me in for a little snack
yeah just me and a couple of mates
the maitre d enters from the kitchen and is stunned to find the restaurant incredibly stuffed with people so theres standing room only
people are even sitting on tables
its a very eclectic mix of people
an angry stuffy old man and his wife and daughter sit horrified at the center
arthurs flanked by carmella the prostitute and sofia from the atm line
wed like pate de foie gras chateaubriand steaks a motherlode of chips and your entire wine cellar please
the daughter of the stuffy couple shes erica speaks
fancy meeting you here
everybody this is erica the very best friend forever of my girlfriend susan
and ericas parents ernest and margaret
to erica and her parents are you familiar with the expression i cant explain anything
who are the women with you arthur
oh um this is sofia
i believe she works for avis
checks the cars for dings dead people in the trunk that sort of thing
and this is carmella
what do you do carmella
whatever you want
but no penetration without a rubber
its all gone a bit tense
shes actually a
of a very small country
is she now
its terribly small
rhode island could beat the crap out of it in a war
yes its a small place
cents in a cab from one end of the country to the other
im talking small
i think i understand how small it is
just had the entire country carpeted this is not a big place
you need to grow up arthur
thats easy for you to say you havent got pairs of short trousers hanging in your closet
maybe we should go somewhere else
maybe you should
he gets out his ultra exclusive black visa card
could i have all those lobsters to go please
the bright dawn sun explodes on the windows of arthurs castle like million penthouse atop the pierre hotel
a huge jacuzzi is full of contented liberated lobsters surrounded by the most amazing toy boat armada in history
we cut around the vast opulent s apartment scattered with unconscious revellers from last night
a mixture of old extravagance and modern excess the place is stuffed with the toys of the boy who has everything an old gun cabinet is stacked with enormous water
a bodyworlds plastinated corpse is posed swinging from a chandelier a bottle of champagne in its hand
damien hursts shark in formaldehyde is half out of its smashed tank a revellers feet protruding from its jaws
unconscious partygoers are slumped on plush seats in a home cinema themed to look like the set of roadrunner while a screen plays episodes of the cartoon
a naked couple lie in a sleeping embrace in a room converted entirely into a sandpit complete with giant toys
big chicago marty arthurs new driver lies on a big sofa consulting his sports pager
homeless robin is filling pans and antique vases with water
a huge photo of arthur modelling riding boots fills a wall beside an old red london telephone box converted into an aquarium bubbling with colorful fish
bowler hatted arthur and sofia are having sex
cup of tea
nice hot cup of hot rosy lee right up your fanny
beneath a rotating solar system mobile good enough to grace a national planetarium on a bed floating magnetically three feet above the floor
a key is turned and the door to the apartment opens
a sensible womans shoe steps over a reveller
arthur and sofia are in an even greater frenzy
the floating bed is wobbling scarily
hugh grant mr bean self deprecation mad cow disease yorkshire pudding bad teeth rain rain rain rain
an older womans hand pulls on a surgical glove
the older woman enters the room carrying a plastic tray as used at airport security
this is jane hobson the british aristocracys longest serving nanny
brightly as he humps morning hobson
unfazed hobson busies herself picking up arthurs trousers and emptying wallet matchbooks and iphone into the tray
she hits a remote
the curtains fly open
a huge tv flips on showing news coverage of arthurs antics last night
im afraid your impromptu stimulus package failed to reignite the economy
reading a receipt de cache cocktail lounge
celebration of kwanzaa
hobsons reading a text on arthurs phone so excited ur funding my movie
the african heritage festival celebrated five months from now
she replies i was drunk
noticing sofias stopped having sex with him why are you stopping
how impolite of me
sofia this is hobson my nanny
hes merely shaped like an adult
is she going to stay here
hobson could you come back in a minute and a half please
youre seeing your mother this morning
nobody told me
actually i did on the other side of the vast moat of champagne known as last night
hobson picks up sofias panties and bra from the floor like a crime scene officer
i wouldnt recommend letting him get used to your breasts dear
he was at mine until he was six
i had to dab tabasco sauce on the nipples to see him off
i cant do this
she pulls away from arthur grabs her clothes and jumps out of bed nearly tipping arthur out
i support your decision
will you be requiring a taxi or just be getting in a random passing car
sofia storms to the door clutching her clothes
arthur can see other revellers being removed by hotel security
say goodbye to your new friends arthur
they have to go back to the recession now
arthur covers his head with the sheet
cancel my mother please hobson
ill work from bed today
but hobson hits a touch sensitive screen on the wall
the magnetic bed thuds to the ground
she taps another control
not the death metal please
shouting over the music arent you a fan of carcass
hobson reads off an album cover in a little wall screen
vomited anal tract is surely a classic of its genre
arthur sits up
hobson stops the music
im going for a shower
ill alert the media
arthur stands naked in his shower a big glass cube jutting out from the balcony like something from a david blaine stunt
hot jets of water are blasted from holes in the cubes ceiling
arthur can see manhattan far beneath his bare feet as he showers
to bombay a travelling circus came
arthur grabs a pair of binoculars which hang on a hook
they brought an intelligent elephant and nellie was her name
we see hobson on a little screen inset into the glass wall
shes on a phone at arthurs computer
female tom hanks
hobson in front of an ebay screen full of purchases picks up her own pair of binoculars and looks down
heading east towards park avenue
through hobsons binoculars we see a middle aged businesswoman who does look vaguely like a female tom hanks
shes early today
can we invite her up and dress her as forrest gump
just for a laugh
well pay her
do your armpits
my employer inexplicably agreed to purchase your
authentic funshine care bear
for plus shipping costs
sorry but that transaction will take place over my dead body and im feeling rather well today
arthurs still peering down through his binoculars
that was your birthday present
you like bears
a priest with thin sideburns emerges from a diner
that man has the constitution of an ox
hobson glances up at arthur washing himself on the screen
that reminds me clean your genitals
heaven knows what wildlife that girl was harbouring between her thighs
arthur in expensive baggy yoga pants and collarless shirt is doing self invented yoga to indian meditation music
i give you sideways farting spider
hobson is sitting exasperated going through various expenditures
arthur you have to stop giving money away
im a philanthropist
with the emphasis on the pissed
really what is it about unearned wealth that brings out such idiocy in those who have it and those who want it
the way youre going youll have spent your inheritance before youve inherited it
shifts to new pose eagle pointing at lesbian
why did you fire jessica
what kind of yoga teacher wont let a pupil invent positions
she was a nazi with a pan pipe c
upwards pooping astronaut
it looks more like rich twit hiding from mother
may i remind you she finances your preposterous existence
i know i know
never bite the hand that fists me
arthur and hobson are in a huge bentley
martys at the wheel still in his cubs shirt but sporting a chauffeurs cap and tie
as he drives he checks a bleeping sports pager
he nearly hits a pedestrian then goes back to the pager
you dont seriously intend to keep employing this gentleman
give the guy a chance hobson
he got laid off in chicago
but he doesnt know his way around new york
i want interesting fun people around me not drones who just get the job done
arthur sees something out of the window
stop the car
marty hits the brakes pitching arthur and hobson forward
arthur hurries up to a small group of tourists
the chrysler building
designed by william van allen
a tour guide wearing a name badge reading naomi is talking
she is gorgeous wearing vintage clothes clutching a clipboard
we understand why arthur stopped the car
and inspired by the machine age of the s this magnificent structure was the worlds tallest building for months before the empire state stole its thunder
she looks out on her sullen miserable tourists
the chrysler got its name when the builder went bust in the cement famine and had to melt down his chrysler to make the pointy bit at the top
if you peer closely you can still make out remnants of a hub cap and a sticker reading honk twice if you voted hoover
some tourists laugh
that was a joke folks
it was built for the chrysler corporation
naomi shares an eye roll with a newsstand guy whos clearly in love with her
the spire is a beauty especially on a winters morning when the sun hits it and it just seems to
how tall is it
feet madam not allowing for pigeon shit
okay lets cross
naomi leads the tourists across the busy road
she has to go back to grab a teenager in the headphones who didnt hear
arthur hurries alongside naomi
can i join your tour please
its plus for the free authentic street pretzel
sorry my bosses make the prices
arthur produces his wallet full of high end credit cards
i cant take cards
ah owe me it
i start on that corner every day on the hour
just as naomis reaching the other side a cabbie driving very aggressively nearly hits her
hey you big blind jerk
doesnt your braille windshield work
the cabbies shocked but laughs and blows naomi a kiss
she smiles back
what did you say
just generalised criticism of his parents and genitals
to the tourists everyone make it over alive
next we enter times square world famous for new years eve when a waterford crystal ball descends at eye poppingly slow speed for the inexplicable entertainment of a million drunk
many people think the square is actually a square despite blatant evidence otherwise
what shape is times square
more tourists laugh this time
when do we get the pretzel
she checks her watch and leads the party inside a laundromat
okay next the very laundromat once used by george gershwin donald trump
naomi approaches a washing machine just as it ends its cycle and makes a loud buzz
mr big from sex and the city and three of the terrorists
she starts unloading the machine of a large mans whites vests underwear shirts all stained red by a baseball cap
she transfers the laundry into a tumble dryer and feeds it quarters
arthur stays close
the welsh poet dylan thomas drank himself to death at the chelsea hotel half an hour after losing a sock in this very dryer
are you abusing this tour to do your errands
are you abusing the tour to stalk me
arthur stares at the big tumble dryers
these things are amazing
have you ever put all your fathers clothes on and just got inside one
naomi looks at him bemused but intrigued as she heads to the door
hobsons out of the car looking for arthur
where the blazes is that boy
they emerge into the street
ahead the jewel in manhattans crown the empire state building
this iconic symbol of american corporate might was adapted during world war in case of attack from enemy forces
at three minutes notice the entire structure can retract into the ground like a tortoises head
thats not possible
i should know im a civil engineer
youre not being very civil to me
some tourists laugh
the building doesnt retract the ground rises up
the ground rises up
thank you sir
they were going to install giant legs so if a plane was flying at the tower it could run away
but wheres it going to run
manhattans in the way
itd have to jump in the hudson
victory to the nazis
is that what you want
the group approaches a pretzel stand
okay folks your pretzel awaits
the group lines up to get their pretzels
do i know you from somewhere
if you go on perez hilton or tmz
what are they
the gossip websites
that the internet
ah my computers too old for all that
for the internet
lifes too short for all this obsessive upgrading
you consider the internet an upgrade
so why do people gossip about you
ah that was a joke
arthur feels a tap on his shoulder
youre late for your mother
sorry this pretzel stand is a watering hole for the crazies
raises her voice to the soup kitchens just up and to the left honey
hobson this is
reads her badge naomi
shes with you
delighted to meet you naomi
normally one has to go to a bowling alley to meet a woman of your stature
ooh grandmas got jokes
you arent the first woman who walks the streets this young man has asked
joan rivers older bitterer sister
seriously who is she
well she started as that but these days shes more of an all round enforcer and bodyguard
naomi looks at her watch and glances to the tourists chewing on their pretzels
she starts to walk away
sorry i have to get out the cattle prod and haul ass
got another tour starting in eight minutes
can i call you
naomi starts to walk away
i dont give my number to grown men with nannies
but as you may not be a grown man its
manhattan swallows the lovely stranger
they cross a huge foyer passing a big sign reading templemead holdings inc to the elevator
but what if this is the one
this is just like the komodo dragon
everyone else is happy to see one in the zoo and leave it there
you had to own one
thank goodness that handbag manufacturer was prepared to take the poor lizard away
you said hes in london zoo
he is arthur
are you the only one allowed to joke now
reception is manned by grant a too cool for school young aryan beefcake straight out of an abercrombie fitch spread
arthur and hobson enter
i dont like it here
of course you dont
people work here
good afternoon mr bach templemead
tell me which of your parents are you most like
abercrombie or fitch
doesnt get the joke i have no connection with that store
my family name is von krausehoff
take a seat please
arthur and hobson sit down
grant picks up a phone
conspiratorial flirty white mid rise briefs
dont fret arthur
this wont take long
then well have ice cream
a large office door opens spookily of its own accord
come in arthur
arthur heads to the door
vivienne bach templemead a formidable tanned american widow in her sixties shakes his hand
you know i prefer mother
you look more like a vivienne
vivienne nods to hobson as the door to her lair shuts
an icy breeze passes between biological mother and surrogate
the office boasts many glass cases full of trophies and framed photos of viviennes younger self showjumping and holding trophies aloft
theres one small photo of vivienne arthurs late father gerald and arthur as a toddler
viviennes engrossed in a document making notations
arthur clearly uncomfortable here sits in a low sofa before her
not looking up so
how are you arthur
i have a riding boot shoot for petrie dressage
but viviennes buried in her work not listening
im meeting ivanka trump for brunch to discuss the environment
shes sending her helicopter to avoid the traffic
viviennes still not listening
crashed my batmobile into the bronze bull on wall street
shes still not listening
has it always been like this
which caused a hole to swallow up the new york stock exchange
shes still not listening
the world economy to collapse and the planet to descend into looting and cannibalism
still not listening
tripped over in the shower this morning
head split open found a family of meerkats hiding in there
hated the thought of the little lads being homeless so i bricked up the remaining half of my brain popped them back in and hobson glued my skull back together
still not listening
im thinking of buying a giant
i think the markets right for it
he watches vivienne
he lets out a huge belch
a big fart
you really are a shoddy mother
vivienne eventually looks up
did i hear you say you were meeting ivanka trump for brunch
today were going to have a friendly chat
then a serious talk
and lastly make a timetable
how does all that sound
do you have any vodka
what happened arthur
you were such a sweet baby
i still wake up in my own poo occasionally
right thats it for the chat
time to transition to our talk
vivienne hits a remote control
a large wall mounted screen fills with a changing collage of him drunk dancing puking making out with women beside countless news headlines
this insanity has to end arthur
as the delightful coffee coloured gentleman who runs this country said the time has come to set aside childish things
cant hobson set them aside for me
susan is a splendid girl
her feet are on the ground shes of fine stock
thats what this is all about
im not marrying susan
i dont love her
you think i spent my marriage to your father skipping through meadows
not after you ran him over in the bentley no
shes not funny
ditto your father
the aristocracy doesnt marry for fun arthur
its about stability
and sinking your fangs into susans fathers bank account
the johnson familys considerable equity in a stormy financial period is merely a side issue
burt is a pillar of the community
his baby formula was taken off the market in six african countries
a completely innocent error in places where theres precious little for children to live for anyway
the families all got gift baskets as compensation
that little bump in the road aside burt is a devout christian
yes because theyre never insane
and where did he get jesus
burt paid his debt to society years ago
he strangled a fireman
who strangles a fireman
im sorry vivienne
ive met someone else very lovely who as far as i know isnt related to anyone who would kill an unsung hero in cold blood
un meet her
arthur youre the end of our line
we need an heir
i nearly gave you an heir
oh give me strength
a bach templemead having a child by a lap dancer called mystery
that was just her stage name
to give her more mystery when she
waved her fanny around
her real name was
what was it again
susan is this year
her egg inventory has dropped by since you met her
you risk having no sons or worse some pea brained hunchback who hugs everyone
i like hugs
and some of them are really good at math
heading to the door you know the frog and toad books
of course you dont
hobson read them to me while you were off riding horses over stripey poles
theyre about fun and friendship not how many unspasticated tadpoles i can squirt up a rich girl
your father would turn in his grave to hear this nonsense
that i wont follow in his footsteps and marry a woman i hate
i think he might climb out of the grave and dance on it
vivienne holds up the document she was notating earlier
my will which i have updated to designate grant in reception as the sole beneficiary
vivienne opens a draw and takes out a huge ring box
shall we segue to the timetable part of our meeting
the liberated lobsters are now living happily at the bottom of the london phone box aquarium
arthur eats lunch alone at a huge table the biggest diamond ring in the world is beside him
hobson brings a plate of vitamins
the ring your father gave your mother i recall
feeling its huge weight did he knock her out with it then drive her to the church in the trunk of his bentley
your father was a gentleman
whats gentlemanly about dying before i knew him
thats just rude
did he ever love my mother
they had their days
at least he doesnt have to wake up every day to a woman with a face like saran wrap stretched over a gargoyle
arthur stares at the ring again
what about naomi
i say this with love uh oh
even by modern male standards youre a breathtakingly immature little shit
coupled with the kind of money you have access to thats deadly
susan may not have a four hour stand up routine about the flatiron building but shes a solid girl who will look after you
i have you for that
naomi answers a giant old cellphone in her modest apartment cooking for her dad ralph a bear of a man slumped in front of the tv watching csi
a picture of naomi and her elderly mother in hospital is on the wall
this is your english stalker
im sorry ive never really understood that question
are you free tomorrow night
sorry im polishing my yacht
arthurs on the toilet in a bathroom whose walls are entirely covered in a photographic mural to make it look like hes sitting at the top of a ski slope
with skis on his feet
is that a euphemism for something naughty
no its a lie
i have a creative writing class
arthur glances down at the ring box on the floor
i have a contractual commitment
you got it
a voice activated toilet paper dispenser spits out a sheet
sorry i was talking to something else
what do you want to do
naomi dishes out the food on cheap plates
its all a big contrast to arthurs setting
come on youve got to try harder than that
what have you always wanted to do
its a first date arthur
not our honeymoon
every date will be our honeymoon
okay uh picnic in the park
or dinner with a view
i like views
arthurs standing at a sink
a list is beside him reading picnic in park movie dinner view
what sort of food do you like
anything but guts and mushrooms
okay enough questions
oh come on
this all helps build up a profile of you before i trick you into my basement
id hate to not have your favourite snacks ready
turkey jerky and pez
are we done
just that i
the line goes dead
hobson is standing behind arthur the ripped out phone cord in her hand
time to get engaged arthur
the komodo dragon can wait
the original delorean from back to the future putters up to burt johnsons imposing tacky mansion
the car stops and the gull wing door swings up revealing an extremely drunk arthur clutching a bottle of champagne
an extremely stiff miserable old butler answers
is it june th at pm
time travel can be a real cunt sometimes dont you think
ill be right back
see you in an hour and a half ago
the butler doesnt laugh
arthur and the butler enter the large paneled study
would you care for anything while you wait
a trampoline and a selection of woodland creatures if thats not too much trouble
the butler leaves
arthur gazes around the room which is filled with antique christian iconography
the ceiling fan is in the shape of a cross
a large scary jesus statue palms outstretched stares at him from beside a fish tank
he sees a cocktail cabinet
he opens the cabinet
nothing but bottles of water
actually you couldnt um
points to the water turn this into a nice romanee conti could you
he sips the water as if its wine
lifts it to jesus
he checks out a huge very old rusty sword on the wall
beneath it is a small information plaque
genuine sword of the first crusade
he looks around then reaches up and takes it off
its very heavy and clanks to the ground slamming his foot
jesus fucking christ
its not like you shouted arthur fucking bach when they pinned you up
arthur lifts the sword again brandishing and twirling it making the noise of a star wars light sabre
feel the force luke
he swings it in a full arc
arthur has decapitated jesus
wheres the head
the door opens
burt johnson a large imposing man with a tiny crucifix around his neck fills the doorway
i er had a bit of food stuck in my teeth and couldnt find a toothpick
burt unperturbed takes the sword from arthur
heck this sword went through three crusades
nothing you can do to harm it
burt walks straight past headless jesus to the water cabinet
arthur looks around desperately for the head
you dont um have anything stronger do you
arthur laughs nervously
but burts not joking
the drunkard and the glutton shalt come to poverty and drowsiness shalt clothe a man with rags
surely a glass of sherry at christmas
burt clinks glasses with him
peace be with you
and also with me
he sees jesuss head
its sitting on top of one of the blades of the ceiling fan
can i be honest with you
youre the real slim shady
i knew it
my faith teaches me to hate the sin not the sinner
but with you i struggle with that belief
burt turns away to get a glass of water
you could switch to judaism
glances up at the fan bit warm in here
do you mind if i put the fan on
arthur turns the fan on a low setting
it rotates slowly the head going around with it
burt turns away to pour more water
arthur grabs the moment to speed up the fan again until its going fast enough and jesuss head falls off
arthur catches it
arthur gets behind burt out of sight temporarily
however i feel about you my daughter loves you
yes its a problem isnt it
arthur reaches out and unseen by burt he reaches out of shot and puts the head back on jesuss body
lets knock our heads together and find a way to stop her loving me
well tell her im on the sex offenders register
no i am and she knows
well say im gay
i did once dabble actually so i can tell a plausible story
you made love to a guy
one moslem doesnt make a mosque burt
you made love to a moslem
no sir it was prince alois of lichtenstein and he made love to me
the fact that it took three bottles of poppers and a jacuzzi full of krug to loosen me up confirmed my heterosexuality
arthur notices that jesuss head is on backwards
burt picks up a bible from his desk and quotes from memory
if there is a man who lies with a male they shall surely be put to death
couldnt there just be some kind of on the spot fine
burt really hammers the table this time
you will stop this talk and marry my fucking
jesuss head falls off
arthur peers around
both arthur and burt see jesuss head at the bottom of the fish tank
it floats back up to the top
its a miracle
he is risen
but susan burts beautiful daughter enters with her best friend erica who arthur met whilst at the restaurant the other night
burt looks from jesuss head to the sword figuring it out
sorry to make you wait arthur
i was talking to your mother
i hear you have something to ask me
arthur feels burts smiling face and hating eyes on him
shall we go
a very precise french waiter performs the specials menu with ludicrous elan
susan is rapt taking it all very seriously
the chef has bathed the bass in a parceline of chilean fennel and finished him with a little gift of kobe beef
also i have a progressive tasting of kumamoto oysters en gelee which evolve on the palate from light and refreshing to complex and spicy
a short story with a twist at the end
susan chuckles approvingly knowingly the twit
she coos with delight and claps in appreciation
do you have something with less words please
the chef doesnt have to re cook it just scrape off the nouns and trim out all that gibberish in the middle
hes just joshing dominic
ill do the skate in wood ear mushroom
a bowl of champagne and a spoon
the waiter leaves despising arthur
arthur did you really have to be so icky to dominic
i just cant handle the whole specials act
its not a shakespearean soliloquy its some heated up dead things that arent on the main menu
a wine waiter slams a bowl and spoon next to arthur
he pours in champagne
you know i was grumbling to your mother about how things are with us sometimes
how im sure youre trying to drive me away
arthur slurps his champagne
but she was explaining that relationships are like property purchases invest only in high end stock avoid anyone up and coming then hold onto the property through thick and thin
to deliver maximum return
isnt that darling
is it possible to buy the house but then rent it out
im not suggesting pimping you
arthur sees a very frail rich old woman dripping in diamonds passing by on her walking frame
you after our first child is born
why cant you learn to laugh at genuinely amusing things
youtube clips of babies giggling
why are we together
i love you arthur
and you love me whatever you think
we dont have the same sense of humour
we dont like the same films food music
you like horses i think theyre arrogant idiots
dont they say opposites attract
that depends on the opposites
racists and the nation of islam dont secretly want to each other
susan youre beautiful
youre fucking loaded
is there really no one else who could make you happy
well i had a thing at college
that was serious for a while
she stops herself
prayed to jesus for it not to work out then shot the bloke behind a meat truck
because jesus would consider that cheating
susan places her hand on arthurs
ask me arthur
arthur takes susans hand
youre the only woman
at this table
a waiter tops up susans wine
arthur now very drunk holds out his champagne bowl to be refilled
youre not happy arthur
nobody who drinks like you can be happy
how do you know
what if the drunker i get the better it is for me
not everyone who drinks is a poet susan
some of us drink because were not poets
the waiter arrives with susans fish and arthurs drink
a real woman could stop you from drinking
itd have to be a real big woman
ask me arthur
arthur sinks to his knees
arthur has passed out
susan kicks him awake
he fumbles away in the gloom getting out the ring box and trying to get it on her finger
at table level susan waits irritated
susan pulls her hand up and gazes at the huge glinting diamond pushed onto the end of her thumb
would you marry me
take the weekend if you want
yes ill marry you
she nods imperceptibly at the waiter
ladies and gentleman the happy couple
a congratulatory round of applause
confetti is thrown
the whole restaurant cheers
susan whips out her blackberry and starts hitting keys
erica will be the planner
she hates me
who i love she loves
oh come on
she always looks like she wants to set fire to my face then put it out with an uzi
susans phone rings
sorry hang on i have erica calling
whats going on
i only just bloody proposed
arthurs phone rings
the caller i
d reads vivienne
he kills the call and sits horrified as the entire restaurant celebrates his grim fate
in the gloom we track past the crushed batmobile the delorean and other famous cars to find arthur sitting in kitt from knight rider
what have i done kitt
this mistakes up there with hitler joining his school debating team
go to bed arthur
arthur jumps out of his skin
but its hobson standing by the car holding a dressing gown and a mug of cocoa
and stop this self pitying bibble
youre going to be fabulously rich
maybe id rather be fabulously poor
some poor people i see look happy
thats either because theyre far away or youve just given them money
arthur poor people have to work
they stand for hours in the rain waiting for buses full of other poor people to take them to things called jobs which they do all year round to pay
for holidays away from those jobs
dont patronise me
i have a job
lying drunk on a bale of hay in riding boots being photographed by another pampered prick wont prepare you for the work i mean
and i dont want to see you suffer
take your fish oil
a very old apple mac sits on a cluttered desk
ralph is in his chair eating popeyes chicken n biscuits watching csi on an old tv with a tiny satellite dish on top
when are we getting cable
we have satellite
honey thats some bullshit aerial from the cent store
its a satellite dish
i read the box
it said no satellite fees to pay because does not receive satellite signals
thats like saying hey eat this plate of broken glass
it wont make you fat
cause its glass
naomi comes in looking absolutely beautiful
she checks her hair in the mirror
its better than nothing
ralph unplugs the dish
the picture improves
no it aint
honey i love you but youre even cheaper than your mom
and she bought food from yard sales
i miss her too daddy
but now shes gone and if im going to keep you in grits and oprah the rest of your life you live by my rules
but you live like youre preparing for a war
and you earn a decent salary
i want to know i can look after you
whats he do this english bum
on csi a female body is being unearthed
yeah and i bet that girl said the same about her date
honey stay home
i dont want you ending up like that poor girl
a bad actress holding her breath
she changes the channel to something else
stop watching csi
a beep from outside
she kisses him and leaves
arthurs bentley pulls up at a quiet part of battery park
sorry we drove around so long
navigation isnt my drivers strong point
theres a huge ding in one side of the car
or road awareness
arthur and naomi sit in the back of the car while marty checks sports results on his pager
can you put this on please
arthurs holding a blindfold
on a first date
are you crazy
were in battery park at night
ive met you once in the company of your nanny
you make a disturbing number of jokes about stalking and basements
my dad already has you down as a mass murderer
and you want me to put on a blindfold
i give you my word if i kill and eat you youll never see me again
she shrugs and puts on the blindfold
arthur guides naomi in the dark
okay im officially a little worried
she tries to pull her blindfold off
arthur removes her blindfold
shes stunned to find herself on a huge blanket under a tree in a clearing lit by numerous candles
before them is spread the most amazing picnic of all time
flowers are everywhere
a log fire burns in a grate
soft music plays
you said you wanted a picnic
he pours them glasses of krug
arthur i dont know what to say
who did all this
the picnic fairies
who liaised with the flower fairies the candle fairies the log fire fairies the hidden sound system fairies
he lifts a silver platter lid to reveal a vast pizza
and the pizza fairies
a crack of a twig from somewhere
did you take account of the heroin fairies who hang here at night
but theres nobody there
a cool breeze blows
arthur uses a remote to turn the log fire flames up
its nice to keep it simple like this
im sick of michelin star restaurants
all that embarrassing crap with the specials
are you kidding
where i normally eat the specials the one that comes with a free toy
arthur lifts a grill lid to turn over succulent steaks
youre rich rich arent you
i get by
it doesnt remotely matter how much or what you spend it on rich
arthur shrugs and swigs champagne pouring more
craziest thing you ever bought
i once inadvertently financed a terrorist cell who said they needed to open a falafel stall
she stops laughing
oh my g d youre serious
whats the craziest thing you ever told a tour party
i once said the manhattan we were in was actually a movie set built for youve got mail but that after the film wrapped everyone moved to the set because
there was less crime
a sudden very loud very out of date ring tone
naomi takes out a huge ancient motorola phone
theres a small tiffany butter knife about two inches from his hand but it might take him eight months to dismember me with it
gotta go battery
love you too
she ends the call
mom died last year
for eight months dad ate nothing but popeyes chicken n biscuits in front of csi
so i persuaded him to move in with me
where he eats popeyes chicken n biscuits in front of sounds like youre very good to him
what are you gonna do
all those years your folks tucked you in did their best to stop you from eating crap in front of the tv
and then one day youre the one saying no honey its bad for you
go to bed
not relating at all yeah
i hate that
looks at her phone nice bit of kitsch
where did you find that
at t store in
youve had it twelve years
its a fine phone
battery life of eleven seconds which cuts the crap right out of conversations
something weird is happening
the world wobbles imperceptibly as the background drops away
she hasnt noticed yet
i cant believe these mofos who gotta keep up with the latest bullshit
cds come along so out with the vinyl
vinyls back in out with the cds
i just kept the vinyl
way cheaper and i get to be incredibly hip once every years
she looks around
cutting wide we see that the picnic was taking place on a grass covered platform with a tree planted in it which is being lifted off the ground by a
i couldnt decide between picnic in the park and dinner with a view
so its a picnic in the sky
isnt it ace
the whole thing is rising higher and higher and higher
no it is not ace you crazy english bastard
this is dangerous
they said to put these on
he pulls back the blanket to reveal seat belts
he straps her in
naomi its okay
its very safe
its this company called aerial delights
they specialise in catering unusual events at a height of feet above the ground
a gust of wind blows the structure which swings
so what got you into the walking tours
youre seriously making date small talk while this is going on
strikes a zen pose when you can be calm in the midst of activity this is the true state of nature huanchu daoeren
lower this freak show to the ground and get me a cab naomi snart
handing her something taste this truffle
naomi tastes it
its clearly delicious
she gazes around as the crane swings them out over the hudson
the view of manhattan of the river of the statue of liberty is mind bogglingly gorgeous from up here
naomi bursts out laughing
she sips champagne
what the hell
gotta go sometime right
at least it wont be years of pain like mom
just a few seconds of screaming and falling with a truffle in my mouth
the tours are a temporary nine year fill in until im drowned in a tsunami of apologies from everyone who failed to recognise my writing genius first time round
what did you write
a kids book
i sent a chapter to a childrens publisher
the rejection letter was the meanest thing i ever read
kids can be so cruel
we have a problem
i told you dont worry
these crane people know what theyre doing
not that kind of problem
arthur feels a blade at his throat
he looks up to see a junkie clearly high standing over him
and the watch
arthur hands him his phone and watch
out of interest how did you get up here
what you talkin about dog
we see a sleeping bag and needles behind the tree
picnic in the sky followed by robbed in the sky
arthur get the giggles as the junkie reaches into his pocket for his wallet
naomi gets involuntary giggles too
this isnt funny you lunatic
the junkie stuffs his face with food swigs champagne from the bottle then walks away
the junkies walking towards the edge oblivious
arthur jumps up causing the platform to wobble scarily
he grabs the junkies arm
the junkie swipes cutting arthurs hand
you dont understand
were feet up in the sky
you on the same shit as me yeah
good stuff right
no were not high
well we are but only in the literal sense
the junkie hurries away again
hes about to walk off the edge
arthur runs and grabs him
they end up in a messy struggle the platform rocking badly
hit the panic button
its next to the truffle station
naomis panicking searching desperately
arthur and the junkie roll over the posh food right to the edge
i cant find it
thats the bouquet of world hams
naomi finds the truffle station and hits the panic button
down in a crane cab an alarm goes off
the driver starts to lower the platform
naomi tries to help arthur as he struggles with the junkie but she gets slashed on the ear
as the platform lowers it swings back over the river to the land and tips them all into the river
naomi and arthur his face bruised are sitting in the car both dripping wet
naomis ear and arthurs hand are bandaged
i had fun tonight
she stares at him as if hes utterly crazy
i cant believe im saying this but so did i
the room has started to fill with grooms paraphernalia morning suits top hats shoes
erica is sitting with a huge sheaf of wedding admin and brochures
vivienne burt and susan listen attentively studying seating plans
it all feels more like a council of war than a wedding preparation
summarising phase alpha formal wear for bridal attendants grooms attendants mens formal wear st john the divine all confirmed
arthurs lying on a chaise longue hungover
a tailor stretches a tape measure along him as if measuring a corpse
are there breathing holes in the coffin
in case im passed out drunk rather than medically dead
dont worry thomas
this whole things just a joke to arthur
hobson brings arthur a glass of water and two nurofen
you are good to me
vivienne irritated hands hobson a coffee cup
take this away
progress on the reception
black inked at the emery roth room at the ritz carlton
the screen lights up with a church graphic
a first pass at the guest list
brides family and friends a d layout of the church appears on a laptop
in the mock up the brides side of the aisle fills with hundreds of computerised guests many labelled with famous names
grooms family and friends about a fifth of that number pop up on arthurs side
we can arrange to screen off the area behind your guests arthur
to make it seem less desperate
arthur groans and leans over a bowl
that graphics too colourful and this hangovers a
on the richter
erica lays out more sheets
cakes caterers floral arrangements photographer
hobson reappears wipes his mouth and takes the bowl
she stands with it accidentally on purpose very close to viviennes nose
will there be anything else sir
you can leave
why all this crap now
whats the rush anyway
the wedding is in a month arthur
i was thinking more sort of ten fifteen years
just to really enjoy the anticipation of the big day
arthur gets up
where are you going
gets out his cellphone sorry dwight d
bridalshower operation ball and chain will have to wait
arthur is walking naomi along the hudson this time in daylight
here we are
were not going to end up in the hudson again are we
i can promise you wont get wet
the hudson is bare of craft
until suddenly a bizarre mini submarine shaped like a dolphin dives out of the water in an arc
arthur and naomi are laughing inside it until they almost collide with a circle tour boat full of tourists
arthur and naomi are hand in hand walking along the street
hes a bit drunk wobbly on his feet a little morose
are you okay
but naomi sees something on the other side of the road
arthur gets a a text from hobson tell her
hey richey rich
want to go somewhere really romantic
its a big tacky shop jacks cent store
the space is huge garish and piled high with countless cheap household cleaners candies foodstuffs and toys
arthurs fascinated a tourist in austerity
everything is cents
a whole penny less than those bourgeois assholes at the dollar store
arthur reads a dolls label
warning this product contains chromium which may be linked to chronic bronchitis and reproductive hazards
that one was on the news
everyone else recalled them the pussies
not my cent
arthur turns the doll over a sticker reads china
maybe chinas trying to wipe out the wests children one by one
he gazes around in wonder
oh i love this place
well id like you to believe its because im a poor girl reduced to buying depressed chef burgers in a can to right said fred because i dont know where
my next paycheck is coming from
but the truth is bargains get me hot
got it from ma
drives my dad crazy
she takes his arm
looking west the ladies hygiene products
note that the more natural sounding the name e
this vermont breeze feminine spray the more lethal chemicals it contains
watch out for the products cunningly labelled to make the dumber consumer think theyre getting the real thing special j crampbells soup aunt janinas maple style syrup
arthur holds a tin with a coffee mate style logo reading friend of coffee
the store music changes to ricky martin livin la vida and ah the music dated sounds for lonely people to buy cheap shit to
they pass an old woman who is going through a stack of identical tins of cheap beans
i once watched a woman shoplift an pack of toilet scrubbers down her panty hose to everything i do i do it for you
arthur just stares at naomi
why are you staring at me
youre good at fascinated
youre good at fascinating
the old woman has knocked over all the beans
are you okay
let me help you
he hands her a tin
not that one
offers her another this one
shaking the tin no
theres less beans in it
sniffs the tin no
she stares and thinks
arthur puts the tin to his ear
i think i hear a mouse inside
arthur shakes and sniffs another tin
oh my g d
this is a good one
he slips her a dollar and whispers to her
quick before someone gets it
naomi gazes at a different arthur to the fool who nearly got her killed
you got a good one here honey
she hurries away
us in a years time
another old couple push a cart past
the old woman sneezes
the old man produces a tissue and gently wipes her nose
if you got ill id care for you
ill get ill
the music changes
oh man phil collins
gotta get out when they start playing phil collins
want to see how to get a quarter from a shopping cart
arthur susan and erica her laptop open are at dinner
hobsons salting arthurs soup then checking the temperature
tiger woods has confirmed
i didnt know you knew him
why is he coming
he agreed to daddys fee
this is going to be the happiest day of my life
she looks at hobson
why is she here all the time
if you can bring erica i can bring hobson
shes my wedding planner
shes my hobson
hobson leans into arthur while tidying his napkin
thats an order
arthurs giving stunned naomi a tour of the huge apartment
reminiscent of a french castle perched feet above new york the penthouse was known from early days as the chateau in the sky
he leads her out onto a second rooftop ballroom
a second ballroom
gotta have a second ballroom
where george gershwin and the astors danced to shep fields and his rippling rhythm orchestra
he grabs her in a ballroom dance move
come on cheap girl
we can be fred austere and stingy rogers
i just need one of your collection of bathrooms
behind the telephone box fish tank
see you on the balcony
arthur goes onto the balcony
naomis notices a figure sitting in the dark stifling a cough
hes not like other men you know
i think i realised that as i plunged into the hudson with a junkie
but i like him
hobson fights another little cough
she gets up
i know he is
thats the problem
what does that mean
im sure arthur will explain
the live version of simon and garfunkels the th street bridge song feelin groovy is playing on speakers
arthur and naomi look out over the view the park dark and empty in contrast to the cheering and clapping on the recording
naomi sips her wine
arthur throws back a whisky
your kids book
what was it about
vlad the inhaler
about an asthmatic boy detective
oh it was dumb
the boy whose heart escaped
it was about this kid who wakes up to find his heart has climbed out and is shinning down the drainpipe to freedom
i love it
rainbow press said it was too disturbing
but it wasnt literal there wasnt a kid lying there with a gaping hole in his chest
it was just this cute little heart bouncing up and down shouting you cant catch me mofo
did he catch the heart
never got that far
arthur wobbles a little more
you like the hooch dont you
only if im sad happy or bored
theres this bit in a book hobson used to read me as a kid that says it all we must stop eating cookies frog
cried toad as he ate another
frog and toad
i loved frog and toad
frog put the cookies in a box
there he said
now we will not eat any more cookies
but we can open the box
frog tied some string around the box
there he said now we will not eat any more cookies
but we can cut the string and open the box
naomi lays her head on arthurs shoulder
so frog took the box outside
he shouted in a loud voice hey birds here are cookies
birds came from everywhere
they picked up all the cookies in their beaks and flew away
now we have no more cookies to eat excellent
said toad i am going home now to bake a cake
they might be about to kiss
but arthur holds back
that was beautiful
its like you read it yesterday
arthurs blissed out face lying in bed in the soft light
frog and toad stayed on the island all afternoon
hobsons reading frog and toad to arthur
they ate wet sandwiches without iced tea
they were two close friends sitting alone together
hobson closes the book and turns out the light
i couldnt tell her hobson
she isnt the komodo dragon
shes my toad
youre quite sure about this
under her breath oh bollocks
naomis sitting with ralph whos scratching off lottery tickets
i dont know honey
whats this teabag even doing here
couldnt he make it in lord of the rings land
not that it matters but hes a billionaire
you have my full permission to marry him
a horse clears a showjumping barrier
arthurs watching sweating in the sunshine while marty and hobson wait in the bentley
id be wary grant
shes planning to ride you around the course next
her last boyfriend broke his ankle jumping that ditch
had to be destroyed on the spot
vivienne canters her horse up to them
whats so urgent that you had to come all the way out here
im in love
with a woman who isnt exactly who youd describe as susan
shes called naomi
arthur weve been through this
wont you at least meet her
what family is she from
the snarts of detroit
never heard of them
no because theyre normal
shes a walking tour guide her dads a retired car worker
susan will generate quality sons not oil soaked car monkeys
why dont you just keep me here pay a servant to wank me into a bottle once a day
then inject it all into a field of heiresses and see who farts out a thoroughbred first
we need an heir
you can have one with stevey steroids here
surely even your uterus has had a face lift by now
arthur storms away towards the car
thats enough arthur
none of your business j crew
you are so ungrateful to your mother
she adores you
come back here
you can shove your inheritance up your horses arse
arthur jumps into the car and it pulls away
vivienne sits shocked on her horse
but then she throws it into a gallop and catches up
suit yourself arthur
follow your heart
but do be aware i consider what youve squandered so far an advance on your inheritance
thats about million
why would you do that
youd never get it back
but youd spend the rest of your life in court
theres a simple solution to all this
and cheat with the nobody from queens
arthurs very drunk maudlin sitting opposite naomi
hes holding his menu upside down
have you been at the cookies
i ate the whole jar
realising its serious oh man
to another susan
engaged to another woman
she slams her menu down
im so sorry i didnt tell you
what are you talking about
this is bullshit
who do you think you are
is this some rich guy thing
i was going to tell you
naomi gets up and puts on her coat
yeah yeah you just
i didnt mean for it to get to this
i planned to just be your friend but then i started to fall for you and i thought i cant marry susan i might fall for naomi
but i thought no i have to marry susan or ill be poor so i wont fall for naomi but then i did fall for you
because youre brainy and funny and gorgeous and too smart to do walking tours
youre too smart snart
theres a cent cereal
anyway so i went to see vivienne and i said i cant marry susan i love naomi shes my frog my toad i dont know any more
then she said noooo if you dont marry susan ill make you pay all the inheritance money back even if you cant ha ha ha
okay she didnt laugh but she might as well have the evil cow
because its like all the money ever and theyll put not just me but both of us in prison and your dad like in dickens
therell be ghosts and oliver and
he stops his mouth flapping like a fish
maybe if id spotted this facet of your personality earlier we wouldnt be having this conversation
she heads towards the door
arthur regains his lucidity for a moment
stay a bit longer
cause itll reduce the proportion of my life ill spend feeling utterly miserable
naomi watches him take another big slug of wine
arthur looks confused
whats she got to do with all this
she shakes her head and goes
naomis looking very sad shaking because shes comforting ralph who is sobbing on her shoulder
its going to be okay
ill get you a beer yeah
i just have to be alone for a minute
oh g d i cant bear it
arthur sits miserable drinking as he sits beside susan at a dane cook gig
naomis been crying
shes reading the screen of an ancient apple mac the boy whose heart escaped by n j snart
she reads a paragraph and smiles
this stuff isnt so bad
arthur and susan are getting a dance lesson from a choreographer clicking her fingers to a club anthem version of the awful jefferson starship song
arthur dances terribly
hobson watches sadly
naomis typing getting back into it
the tailor is positioning a top hat on arthurs miserable head
hes shirtless and unshaven
the sun is coming up over queens
an ancient dot matrix printer spits out a final page
naomi is at a desk with a pile of finished manuscripts and envelopes to various publishers
one is to rainbow press
naomis pointing at the chrysler building for a particularly grumpy bunch of tourists of all types and ages
designed by william van allen and inspired by the machine age of the s the chrysler
i got a question
hell who wants to come home with me and butt in with questions while im watching letterman
how tall is dave
late night no sleep long day
whats your question
the opening bars of a familiar song start up somewhere filling the street
suddenly some of the members of her tour group start lip syncing to phil collins
how can i just let you walk away just let you leave without a trace
when i stand here taking every breath with you ooh
youre the only one who really knew me at all
a van with speakers on the top is parked nearby pumping out the music
what is going on
how can you just walk away from me when all i can do is watch you leave
cause weve shared the laughter and the pain
and even shared the tears
a yellow cab goes by the driver lip syncing out the window
youre the only one who really knew me at all
the song hits a hard club mix
arthur bursts from the back of the van in a frog outfit
the tourists launch into a well rehearsed dance
lip syncing too so take a look at me now cause theres just an empty space
and theres nothing left here to remind me just the memory of your face
take a look at me now cause theres just an empty space and you coming back to me is against all odds and thats what ive got to face
just take a look at me now
the song builds to a dance crescendo
a magical moment
the crowd watches
how can she say no
sorry to be a wet blanket folks
hes getting married
but i guess he didnt choreograph that bit for you
but this took ages to rehearse
i had the frog outfit specially made
these arent actual tourists
i gathered that arthur
are you capable of doing anything without it being a grand gesture
what do you mean
its like hobson said
youre not like other men
if you were normal if the money and the booze didnt cloud everything youd deal with the fact that youre engaged rather than just looking for ways to win me
but it was a lovely routine really
i just wanted to see you
he takes out his flask and has a swig
you need to see someone arthur
arthurs in his cuboid david blaine shower
he picks up his binoculars
female tom hanks has had a haircut
but marty pipes up on the little inset hobson screen
he looks at a note in hobsons handwriting
it says here you shouldnt forget to clean your junk
i guess thats what
genitahlio ah is
what are you doing there
hobson left me in charge
shes gone to bed
she had a headache
shes had quite a few headaches lately
she blacked out
hobsons in bed watching a discovery channel documentary about grizzly bears
arthur hits pause
put my bears back on arthur
not until you answer my question
hobson closes her eyes
she hams the next bit
im travelling down a white tunnel
to a garden
why is it so hot
whos the red gentleman with the big pitchfork
will you cut it out
there are three books
this is important
take them back to the library
she feigns a melodramatic death
dont die any more
its getting very boring
old women like bears get sore heads
are you okay
you look a little lost
naomi doesnt want to see me
a terrible shame she had to go
a little tart like that could have saved you a fortune in prostitutes
listen old woman
dont ever talk about naomi that way again
what gives you the right to be such a snob
mary poppins with a menopause
arthur storms out slamming the door
but within seconds he returns humbled ashamed a regretful naughty child
hobson ive never raised my voice to you
im sorry too
you know arthur you may be growing up
do you want anything
i want to be younger
sorry its your job to be older
if youre feeling better tomorrow will you accompany me somewhere
she pats his hand gently
of course arthur
marty and hobson are staring bemused
how do i look
arthurs wearing a huge ludicrous wig and beard
hobson and marty fight giggles
i cant have this getting out
im in the public eye
yes it would be disastrous to harm such a dignified profile
he looks scared at the building
its going to be okay arthur
aa members are sitting in a circle
megan a respectable looking smart woman is speaking
i was waking up four five six mornings a week in different mens beds
arthur in his ludicrous disguise hobson and marty enter
i wanted to die
to be nobody
a man james speaks emotionally
i steal from my friends my family
i sold my sons pedal car so i could score junk
arthur utterly depressed has his head in his hands
i accidentally backed my car over my mother outside walgreens
he tries to fist bump james
this isnt a sports bar in chicago
these people arent here to brag
i had a business a home and its all gone
im in this fucking grave and theyre pouring the earth in
i dont know about anyone else but this isnt exactly killing my thirst
well why did you come
whats your name
seriousness his least favourite thing is upon him
he takes a deep breath
but im sorry youre not going to convince me my life isnt fun
and no offence but if i ran over my mother id be out celebrating
which is what i plan to do right now
come on hobson
arthur leaves the door swinging behind him
and i believe i have a dependence on alcohol
the woman confessing is hobson on arthurs behalf
and because i have done nothing with the astonishing opportunities handed to me apart from pissing away my inheritance and drinking enough to kill a rhino
arthur having heard comes back in
but imagine being me
i once ended up in bed with the daughters of three of the rolling stones
but a i dont remember a thing about it b apparently i was sick on two of the women before c losing control of my bladder on the third
all such fun
until the strangers i pay to be my friends have gone the fog parts and theres a hole so big you could pour all the champagne in the world into
it and never fill it up
but ive got so much potential a good heart im a good person even if ive completely wasted my short precious life because i somehow convinced myself that happiness is
a komodo dragon a case of booze and the memory of having once stripped naked to beethoven for a coachload of german tourists who i met outside the rainforest cafe
an awkward silence
its always the quiet ones
the car drives through manhattan
arthur stares out of the window beaten drunk
maybe you can go every time i crave a drink
hobson doesnt even crack a smile
arthur gets out his phone and scrolls past naomis name to susans
look i know the wedding date is set
but fancy bringing it forward
i just want to get it over with
in a good way
think about it yeah
he ends the call
he looks to hobson
its the agony of possibility hobson
it just hurts too much to know i could still be with naomi if i had the guts
just promise youll never ask me to sleep with susan for you
naomis riding the bus
her phone rings
she rolls her eyes and answers
arthur if thats
yes i did
well i worked pretty hard on it
incredibly excited she grabs a pen and writes on a walking tours brochure julian barber
ill call in dead to work
she writes tuesday
and an address
theres a ring at the doorbell
good afternoon mr snart
is naomi here
you must be the nanny
i must be
ralph embraces her
please stop this i cant inhale and am in danger of treading on one of your knuckles
ralph releases her
if you and your undershirt would walk two paces back i could enter this dwelling
naomi appears looking more of a writer than a tour guide
ever since i met arthur i liked him
we have to make sure these two wonderful kids stay together
try not to talk
its not your words but the breath which bears them
perhaps you could repair to the east wing and make me a cup of tea
i wish to speak to naomi
arthur is having a pre wedding party tonight
you should come
oh should i
are all the other girls he passed up going too
hobson picks up a letter from rainbow press and peruses it
dont you want to show arthur how well youre doing
tell him thanks but i have a deadline
arthur doesnt know im here
hes far too decent to be involved in something so tawdry
you could bring your father
a magical experience before hes too big to leave this apartment
why would i go to this
why would i do that to myself
my dear if theres one thing old women can tell its young men in love
and the food promises to be breathtakingly free
hobson has a slight dizzy spell and sits down
are you alright
better than you dear
you really look out for arthur dont you
and it is a job that i recommend highly
ralph comes back and with a cup of disgusting looking tea
you really look out for this gentleman from what ive heard
ah what am i gonna do
the no kill pet shelter wont take him
ralph hands hobson the cup of tea
would you go the bathroom and commence washing
you only have three hours and it could be quite a project
naomi takes the tea
i appreciate what youre trying to do but im not going to that party
hobson gets up still dizzy
have you seen a doctor
and he has seen me
i think arthur has a very good friend
may i kiss you on the cheek
is it something you feel strongly about
but hobson falls back into her chair heavily looking sicker
hordes of smartly dressed rich people are gathering on burt johnsons mansion for the society night of the year
a high level security presence is much in evidence
a live band plays a cheesy soft rock version of addicted to love
aristocrats mingle with crass new money types mingle with tiger woods
the band finishes the song
were going to move things up tempo now with the only thing that looks good on me is you
the band start playing again
partygoers hit the dance floor
vivienne susan burt and erica pass a huge ice statue of susan and arthur in a loving embrace and amazing catering
splendid affair susan
dont thank me thank erica
erica shrugs modestly
burt puts a big burly arm around him and squeezes him a little too hard
naomi climbs out of a crappy cab
shes on her phone
with all due respect hobson youre talking out of your frumpy english ass
arthur needs to know
hobsons in bed looking ill
ralphs fussing over her pillow
hobson slaps him away
you are not to pull him out of that party on my behalf
but naomis gone
ralph tries to plump the pillow again
youre gonna get through this babe
then who knows what the future may hold
naomi hurries past a door man with a clipboard
excuse me madam
naomi grabs the arm of a male guest
snart plus one
she hurries in with the bemused but delighted man
the door man checks his clipboard
naomi enters the party releasing the man whos disappointed to see her go
she looks around for arthur getting admiring looks from other men and women
ross dress for less
you know where arthur is
naomi moves on
the door man appears looking around for the gatecrasher
the man whose arm she took on the way in hes called justin is also on the prowl for her
burt takes to the stage to applause
when arthur proposed to my daughter i was overjoyous
the bach templemeads are my kind of people classy
people like in shakespeare in love who esprouse the same values i have always upheld both in my business and spiritual life
but tonight isnt about me or americas leading independent formula brand
arthur takes the stage to wild applause
thank you burt
ive actually prepared a little surprise song with my friends here
the band starts playing close to you by the carpenters
arthur sings to susan down in the crowd
why does cash suddenly appear every time you are near
the audience laugh
just like me it longs to be close to sue
why do cars fall out of the sky all of which i can buy
ill sing a proper song
you say potayto and i say potahto you say tomayto and i say tomahto potayto potahto tomayto tomahto lets call the whole thing off
you say aa and i say no way you say red bull and i say go away rehab no way red bull
justin approaches naomi whos still looking around for arthur
we meet again
have you seen arthur
ill take you to him
justin takes naomis arm and leads her at a leisurely pace
they pass a portrait of susan
im so happy for arthur and susan
justin points at a portrait of susan
isnt she beautiful
of course she is
why would arthur marry a pig
the door man appears seeing naomi
what business is your family in
oh im the heiress to a fortune built on small pets
hamsters mice doglets
the technologys not perfect
seeing a horse the size of a can of soup fall dead before your eyes that shit stays with you
they walk through a door ending up in a garden
are you sure hes this way
naomi turns to a woman
to a woman excuse me
have you seen arthur
naomi hurries away running straight into the door man
excuse me madam
youre not an authorized guest
i know that
im here to give arthur some very important news
of course you are
takes her arm shall we discuss this outside
get your hands off me
its okay jeff
she can stay
arthur can i talk to you
a man in a white coat is on the phone beside hobsons bed
we ran tests
it was just a dizzy spell
well be sending her home tonight
but what about the other blackouts
hobson snatches the phone from the man in a white coat
arthur im fine
do not leave that party
arthurs on the phone coat on in a big empty panelled room
especially now that naomi is there
the call ends
arthur looks across at naomi at the other end of the room looking so beautiful
theyre sending her home
do you want a drink
no thanks arthur
i should go
but you came all this way
theres ridiculously fancy food theres
can you just call me a cab
youre a cab
no laughter this time
its not funny
he takes out his iphone again
stares at it
orders cabs to take the girls away
he scrolls the phone for a cab number
thank you for coming all this way
im sorry for all the stupid presents and calls and gestures
naomi looks up at a portrait of burt and young prissy but beautiful susan
she was a looker from the get go
what were you like as a kid
i thought the moon followed me
i would walk and think the moon went any place that i did
i thought it meant something special would happen
so ive been waiting
what an ass
arthur sees a sound system
he goes over and plugs his iphone into it then takes naomi in his arms
weve been through this
call that cab please
arthur looks down into her eyes and hits play on his iphone
music starts its not a slow smoochy song but big brassy and upbeat
arthur ballroom dances naomi at speed around the room
to bombay a travelling circus came they brought an intelligent elephant and nellie was her name
what the bejeezus is this
hobson used to sing it to me
one dark night she slipped her iron chain
off she ran to hindustan and was never seen again
nellie the elephant packed her bags and said goodbye to the circus off she went with a trumpety trump trump trump trump
its energetic wonderful as romantic as any slow dance
they stop dancing
arthur stares at naomi
at last they kiss
but the music stops
is this the tour guide
shes a writer
is this the vivienne
crowded field writing
maybe someone will see her potential
we all know whos seen her potential
oh of course you dont know do you
arthur suddenly goes pale
what is going on here
my son became fond of you
youre not the first
or the last i imagine
anyway i was scanning his monthly expenses which always makes for entertaining reading all those gifts for all those girls and found hed bought an entire publishing company called
what was it now
you bought rainbow press
so you could tell them to publish my book
he knows people dear
im sure you do too though the people you know tend not to own books let alone publishers
arthur i trust well see you back at the party
susans a little worried
naomi storms away
i didnt think i would ever see you again
i was just trying to give you some
self esteem isnt a gift arthur
it isnt a fur coat or a thousand billion orchids or an apartment made from truffles or whatever else you rich freaks use to express love
arthur looks incredibly hurt
i do express love
i love you
dont say that
you just told me to
and stop going on about me being rich
you think its easy being trapped by money
naomi gets her old phone out
she speaks into it
arthurs being held against his will in guantamoney bay
stop riffing with me
how dare you do what you did
i didnt need your money to feel good about myself
being cheap gives you that
at least im prepared to have fun
im not all oooh look at me with my antique food arent i cool
your phones rubbish
its made of bits of old doorbell and vibrator i bet you can only get calls from on it
as long as i dont get any from a drunk rich fuck up like you
a door opens
i heard shouting
im an employee of arthurs
i came to complain about the conditions
mr bach templemead i know you thought putting half and half in the staff kitchen was an improvement
but some people prefer coffee mate
you were disrespectful
naomi walks away slamming a door behind her
because you changed the creamer
arthur marty called from the hospital
its okay hobsons fine
i spoke to her doctor
apparently you didnt
hobson is lying in bed looking even iller than before
its just a headache
stop saying that
you bribed a hospital orderly to tell me you were okay
what do doctors know
the door opens
marty enters with a shopping cart
i give you the amazing costly health giving presents
arthur starts to produce gifts for hobson jewellery expensive bath products perfumes clothes a dvd
wake up and smell the carcass
reads the dvd a compilation of the bands most stomach churning music videos and deathly live performances
he produces a darth vader helmet
put this on please
i dont want to put it on
put it on
or ill fire you
okay or i wont fire you
she dons the full face helmet
how much did you waste on this poppycock
arthur and marty laugh
i see youve decided not to grow up after all
she sounds like darth invader
finally arthur unwraps a very high end dvd player and tv
the room is dark
arthur hobson and marty are all on the bed bathed in blue light from the huge new tv
stargazer known for her distinctive white mottled back
its a documentary about grizzly bears
is determined to catch the salmon despite the treacherous rapids
a doctor enters
mr bach templemead
do you have a moment
arthurs looking delighted
but the doctor is grave
thats great news
we see a short montage of arthur now sober taking care of hobson with martys help reading to her
watching another bear documentary
arthur doing silly yoga for hobson
arthur is quietly cleaning hobsons room
he stumbles on a document
it reads the boy whose heart escaped by n j snart
he opens it
how did this get here
i have no idea
you might have a brain tumour but youre not a complete veggie burger just yet
has naomi been here
she dropped by once or twice
frightful needy trollop
i thought she gave up writing
arthurs reading the manuscript bearing hobsons notations shorten wonderful do not cut
just trying to spare her outright humiliation while im still here
dont wear yourself out
youre not going anywhere soon
he taps the top of a state of the art heart monitor
worlds most advanced heart rate monitor
the tiniest problem will alert your own private platoon of paramedics camped out downstairs
hobson takes arthurs hand
ive loved caring for you so much
but youll never grow up with me around
so either i retire
or i die
option involves too much paperwork and blather with having to find somewhere else to live
and no offence to you dear boy
she glances at a massive pile of bear documentary dvds beside but i think weve exhausted the bear based entertainment
which leaves option
arthur cant fight the tears any more
youre a good son arthur
you can do anything with your life that you want
just like i did
but you spent half of it looking after a spoilt drunk twat
im past my use by date
sorry hobson you dont win this one
i need you to care for me
holds up a pill now take your fish oil
arthur in a chair at the end of the bed wakes with a start from a dream
he looks across to hobson who is very still
the expensive monitor is dead
he jumps up
hammering the machine why the fuck has the stupid thing not gone off
he sees that the monitor is unplugged
the cord is in hobsons hand
arthur sobs his heart out
its a few weeks later
the place is very very messy
the place also seems to be heavily splattered with all colors of paint
a big lump of red paint thuds into hobsons giant teddy bear which is already heavily spattered
arthurs sitting naked apart from a helmet in his tiny army paintball tank
hes in a blank drunken daze firing paint at the teddy
the tank turret rotates
he shoots walls possessions furniture
would frog ever get up again
or would he just sit in his tank crying and soiling himself until he died of dehydration because he didnt even have the energy to eat a wet sandwich
he looks down at an ashes urn
why are you in there when i need you
lifts lid off urn hes rewarded with a face full of ashes
angrily he spins the turret through degrees firing paint
marty comes in and is hit hard by paint
hows the tea
shockingly bad thanks marty
want to talk about the cubs game
can i be alone please
arthur picks up his phone and scrolls down to naomis name
he thinks for a moment hits call
naomi is shopping
she looks at the phone sees arthurs name
she so wants to answer
arthur stands on the balcony
he peers down at manhattan far far below
a couple are having sex
a body falls past the window
the body falls past a window
a huge crash from off
passersby are staring in horror at a yellow cab its roof caved in the driver shaking in shock
tilt up to find hobsons huge teddy bear lying on the roof
arthurs on his phone again
leaving a message naomi
i doubt youll ever get this because your voicemail probably consists of a year old woman who writes the message down in hieroglyphics then loses it down the back of
her incontinence loin cloth
hobson died and ive fallen apart
the doorbell rings from off
can you get that
could you get it
he throws the cellphone off the roof
a couple of seconds pass
we hear a very faint howl of pain from whoever it hit
arthur opens the door
you havent answered the phone for eight days
susans beside herself
whats going on
what do you thinks going on
she bustles in past arthur
a platoon of maids follows
you cleany penthouseio
come on arthur
have to pick yourself up lad
its like when nixon my great dane had to be put down
frightful state for days
but i pulled myself together
youre comparing hobson to
a faithful humble companion who
um i think id like you to leave if thats okay
remember who pays for this apartment arthur
he guides her out the door
you had damn well better be at that wedding boy
if im going to drink myself to death ill need resources
my mothers dead
he slams the door
the phone rings again
arthur is sitting in an estate attorneys next to mr finke a small dirty man
attorney margaret aherne is at a desk opposite them reading from a will
the last will and testament of jane hobson
i leave my life savings to the tulare bear sanctuary tulare county california
aherne hands mr finke a check for
thatll explain the strong smell of bear shit
aherne opens a tiny envelope
to arthur bach templemead i leave this
she produces a teabag
to operate kettle press red button
milk in refrigerator thats the big box with the pretty light that comes on when you open the door
youre going to be okay
now its your turn to look after someone
all my deepest fondest love my dearest boy
im smiling down at you or more likely up at you forever and ever h xxxxxxxx
close up on the kettle steam issuing forth from the spout
then a mug with the teabag in it
the kettle boils
a hand pours hot water into the mug
milk is added
and a drop of vodka
burt and vivienne are standing outside greeting guests
i just want you to know if he doesnt show up for this wedding i cant know what ill do
dont worry burt
hes cleaned himself up
hes stopped drinking hes anxious to get a real job
hes become a responsible citizen
arthur is stalking drunk but determined through the crowds
he comes upon a group of tourists standing by a tour bus
naomis now wearing a headset mic pointing south
due to a tragic error in the architects drawing the original statue of liberty unveiled in was just seven inches tall
new yorkers rioted having come expecting to see something more impressive than a garden gnome holding up an ice cream
arthur pushes his way through the tourists
he sees her bus and headset
youre on a bus
with a microphone
girls gotta have a dream
can you take the next years off
are you okay
youre a mess
you look like you
i accidentally swallowed three bottles of hand sanitizer
drinking was the only way i could get the courage to come here and say this i dont need the money
i love the money
but i dont lie awake all night wondering how ill live without ever seeing it again
i just wonder what its like to go hours without a steak tartare
naomi looks unconvinced
arthur pulls out his wallet and takes out a load of credit cards
the american express centurion card you have to spend at least a year to keep it which i blow in a quiet week
he drops it down a drain
he produces another card
sothebys world elite mastercard for art collectors
drops it down drain too
the tourists are enjoying this
and king of all idiotic reckless insanity the visa black card
this last one he hands to a passing homeless man
daily atm limit
the man runs into the road
as arthur talks out of focus we see the man hit by a car but get up and keep going
producing fancy iphone the worlds only platinum iphone
with police radio app
he tosses it over his shoulder
it lands in the beef juice pan of a street french dip stall
a bigger crowd is gathering
arthur takes off his jacket
vicuna wool shorn once every three years from the south american camelid
he throws the jacket in a passing cabs window
he takes off his pants
westmancott trousers ten months to design fit and make
he hands the trousers to a passerby
off with his watch
who wants the watch neil armstrong wore to step on the sun
arthur flings it in the air
a crazed fight breaks out
arthur stands before naomi in just his underpants and socks
these are from the gap
im so sorry about hobson
they step away from the tourists
im sorry about the rainbow press
so how did susan take it that youre not marrying her
you havent told her
whats it to you
shes your arch enemy
are you six
she isnt my enemy
shes the woman you proposed to
i couldnt tell her
todays the biggest day of her life
the weddings today
looks at his wrist wheres my watch gone
looks at her watch its eight minutes to
its too late then
naomi hands arthur her phone
i dont know her number
its in my phones address book in that gloop
john the divine
can we please just get me some clothes
fourth largest church in the world
th and amsterdam
its about four miles
you want me to go there
whats the alternative
jilt susan at the altar
can i expect the same treatment when you dump me
i love you
naomi starts herding her tourists onto her bus
susans dad will
prove youre not the same pampered little boy who can have what he wants then toss it aside when hes bored
then well talk
she sits in the driving seat and belts up
i dont even know the way
right on broadway
left at times
right on th
back on broadway
right on amsterdam
the church is the big stone pointy thing full of rich people
the bus door shuts
naomi drives away
a taxi stops
arthur feels for his pockets
um can anyone spare
to the driver how much to st
john the divine please
to the crowd can anyone spare please
what about tip
the crowd just stare back
the taxi drives away
arthur looks at a street clock
arthur starts running in his underwear
guests are taking their pews
arthur runs along fifth
susan is being fussed over by bridesmaids
arthur runs up broadway passing a watch and clock store
every timepiece reads
burt sitting in a pew looks at his watch
he looks around for arthur then scowls very scarily
arthur stops out of breath
he sees a line of street entertainers
that gives him an idea
gather round for the nearly naked yoga man yogi bare
i give you
arthur strikes a sequence of silly poses and names
chicken forgetting birthday
tourists throw money
arthur grabs it up
he looks up at the times square digital clock
a taxi stops
arthur throws the money to the driver
how far can i go with
and a japanese coin with a hole in it
a block and a half
arthur jumps in
the cab screeches away
the cab halts
arthur jumps out and starts running again
he sees a bus with columbus circle in its window
we cut to people cheering arthur hanging on the buss front bicycle rack
but the driver sees him and hits the brakes
arthurs flung forwards but gets up and keeps running
he sees a subway station
excuse me are there trains down there like in films
arthur runs down the steps
a train pulls on to the platform
arthur leaps aboard
arthur stands among new yorkers none of whom bat an eyelid at his appearance
he looks up at the stations
to a male passenger excuse me
terribly sorry to bother you but
without looking at him the guy hands him a dollar
susan is ready
she looks to the door
erica who is peering out shakes her head with an i told you so look
naomis driving her bus up nd street
into a headset mic originally a rough neighbourhood
some say it was called nd street because it wasnt safe to spend more than forty seconds on it
a few grudging laughs from the tourists
if you burst into song youre off this bus
i want to see st
john the divine
sorry sir thats not on our route today
i want to know if arthurs gonna make it
you should be there for him
other tourists agree
it says here ask about your personalised tours
i want the personalised tour
john the divine
so do i
john the divine st
john the divine st
arthur comes bounding out of another station
clutching his dollar he sees a bus
he runs aboard and up to the driver
im trying to get to
arthur feels eyes on him
the bus is full of school children
its a school bus
they all stare for a beat then get out cellphones to report the weirdo in their midst who runs off again and up broadway passing a stores line of shopping
he starts emptying them of quarters
a police car rounds the corner
uh unit j we have reports of an indecent exposure on a school bus
arthur jumps in a shopping cart as the truck passes he launches forward grabbing the rear fender
burt gets up squeezing past tiger woods
arthurs cab pulls up outside the church surrounded by onlookers and paparazzi
arthur leaps out and fights his way through the crowd
people start to recognise the crazed sweating panting weirdo in underwear
paparazzi and pedestrians photograph and film him
he runs into the church
the church is packed with the great good rich and famous
vivienne sits waiting
arthur stumbles in at the back
arthurs trying to inch along the back
but the congregation falls silent watching him
he stumbles up the aisle looking up to jesus in similar scantily clad appearance on a cross
im not him
shows his wrists look ma
arthur slips in a side door
susan is sitting sad bridesmaids comforting her
susan turns and is shocked to see arthur
whats going on
he leads her away from the bridesmaids
the girl at the party
the one who talked all that rubbish about coffee mate
i love her
susan slaps arthur
were getting married
but i dont love you
and you think i love you
whats not to
i never have
susan youre upset you hate me
now im sorry i have to go or your dads going to do whatever he did to your boyfriend from college
daddy never hurt alex
he paid her parents to send her away
you may have noticed that daddy is homophobic
he swore hed disown me if it happened again
why do you want to marry
arthur glances across sees erica skulking
am i your beard
why else do you think id spend more than seconds in your company
youre the perfect cover
have you been pretending to like dane cook as well
heads to the door thanks for your honesty
i dont feel so bad about calling this off
erica steps in his way
you can drink as much as you like sneak off to naomi
we keep the money
we live our lives
i may be a weak pathetic drunk
but i wont marry a lesbian dane cook fan
arthur pushes past erica
arthur stumbles out on the altar
the congregation stares
he taps a mic from the pulpit like a stand up
good evening st
john the divine
anyone in from st
naomis tour bus screeches up
she hurries out
arthurs still before the congregation telling a story
and the first turned to the second horse and said that dog just spoke
the hateful silence that only angry rich people can muster
the joke being that its inconsistent that the horses can speak but the dog cant
naomi creeps in at the back
the weddings off
the bride has had second thoughts
i cant say i blame her
would you marry me
you wont be seeing me again as im going to be poor
ill be shopping at the cent store
six pork chops for under a dollar
tiger woods discreetly scribbles c store chops on a torn out bible page
im glad we had this talk
ill let you get on with the wedding
a huge crucifix strikes arthur hard
burt crazed with hatred drags him by his hair off the altar
burt is bashing arthurs head hard against a stone font
vivienne bursts in
followed by naomi
get off my son
but nothings going to stop burt
louder than anyone yet susan is over burt brandishing a virgin mary statue
you wouldnt hurt me
you crushed me
i just wanted you to be happy
you wanted to stop me being a lesbian
shut up you dirty little dyke harlot
erica leaps on burt pummelling his face with her fists
you want some more bitch
arthur looks up at susan
erica thats enough honey
susan kisses her
why didnt you tell me
we could have worked something out
naomi give arthur a look
the church is empty apart from arthur and naomi on the altar
naomis trying to remove something from arthurs neck
vivienne is sitting alone in a pew near the back
why are you doing that
because i hate an infection
no you keep still
he kisses naomi passionately
what are we going to do arthur
ill get a job
ill model cheap riding boots for people with no horses
you can write books about boys whose lungs have run away
vivienne walks up to the altar
a bach templemead has never been poor and were not about to try that experiment with you arthur
that said youve shown strength of character for once instead of blubbing on about frogs and friendship
the inheritance is yours
all i ask is with hobson gone you finally start treating me like a mother
i cant do that
i beg your pardon
youve never earned that title
i wouldnt fake it with susan
i wont with you
i will withdraw this offer forever
dont doubt me boy
arthur shakes viviennes hand
take care viv
arthur takes naomi by the hand and they leave the church
i am serious
if you walk out of that door
vivienne sits in a pew
for once she looks small old alone
arthur and naomi step into the daylight pushing past paparazzi and press
marty is waiting in the batmobile now repaired
this isnt mine any more
fancy joining us for a bowl of special j
marty gets out
the three walk away up amsterdam avenue
naomis typing sipping sprike fake sprite
beside her is a printed manuscript titled snarts fake new york a bogus guide to the worlds greatest city
on the computer screen is
the irish hair famine swept through manhattan rendering every resident bald for a week
this is outrageous
arthurs struggling with a very crap piddly shower
rather than the glory of manhattan from his shower in the sky arthur just has a bare wall opposite to look out on
operational heat controls in a shower are a basic human right
a hole in a pipe sprays his groin with hot water
ralph and marty sit watching sports marty cheering as the yankees are losing ralph miserable the doorbell rings
ralph stands hammering at the bathroom door holding a package
ralph hammers again
the bathroom door opens
arthurs holding a giant bottle of cheap shampoo
his eyes are bright red streaming
what the hells in this shampoo
it sure as hell isnt tea tree oil
ralph hands him the package
package for you
with any luck an apartment for you and lurch
i thought you liked me
i may have been seduced by money
naomi appears from the bedroom
she finds arthur staring at a framed photo of hobson as a beautiful young woman holding arthur as a happy laughing toddler
a note is attached
reading it out can i be your friend at least
love vivienne xxx
the inheritance is yours
it always was
arthur looks at naomi at ralph at marty
on balance id go for it
they look at naomi
you were never happy rich honey
its only been a month
remember however hard life gets love will always find a way
off their stares what
cant a girl make a joke
arthur steps out of a bentley
arthur enters the aa meeting clutching hobsons ashes
brought her for moral support
but ill do the talking this time
