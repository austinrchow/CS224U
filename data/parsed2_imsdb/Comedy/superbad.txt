written by seth rogen evan goldberg july which builds to an exciting crescendo filling us with the expectation of a thrilling action packed opening sequence
instead we get seth seventeen a bit heavyset in the midst of a sad attempt at growing a goatee and clearly a terrible driver cruises along while fiddling with the
he pulls out his cell and dials
evan seventeen a little too tall and slim a boy who clearly never figured out how to style his hair is finishing off a bowl of cereal
he is on his cell phone
i was doing research last night for next year and i think im gonna go with bang bus
which ones bang bus
the one where they bang the chicks on the bus
thirteen bucks a month
total access live web cam feed
itll be like im on the bus banging them myself
that stuffs bullshit theyre all faking it
and plus your parents are gonna look at the bill
it shows up under a different name
beat i hope
that wouldnt look good
maybe i should just pick the one with the least dirty sounding name
weapons of ass destructions out then
seth pulls up in front of a house
i could tell my parents im doing a project on rome and i have to research orgies
evan walks out his front door
we reveal he is walking towards seths car
still into phone yeah
just tell them your taking a class on blow jobs
they both hang up and evan gets in the car
seth is about to pull away when evans mother comes out the front door
thanks for taking him seth
evan changes the radio station
seth slaps his hand
dont touch that
you two are so funny
i cant imagine what youll do without each other next year
evan told me you didnt get into state
yeah you know
i got some other places
i think well be fine
are you going to miss each other
miss each other
seth and evan drive off
i am truly truly jealous that you got to suck on those tits when you were a baby
fuck you man
they drive up to clark secondary
there is a giant sign that reads seniors two glorious weeks until graduation
seth turns into the staff parking lot
seth and evan walk past a group of smokers towards the
youre being an idiot man
you really shouldnt park there
im a senior about to graduate
they should be suckin my balls
its the least they can do for stealing three years of my life
they walk past dimitri big native american guy as they enter the store
dimitri aggressively bumps his shoulder into seth
what the hells wrong with dimitri
oh yeah dude i forgot to tell you
i knocked the fuckin shit out of him in capture the flag last week
th grade camp he gave me whiplash in king of the ring
i fucking hate that guy
they go to the magazine rack and stare at a maxim cover
look at those nipples
theyre like baby toes
its not fair
i have to hide every erection i get
sometimes i get boners so big i cant hide them
and then i get nervous and my heart starts pounding and it all just like feeds my boner
it just becomes this
thats attached to me
and it wont go away
just imagine if girls werent weirded out by our boners and they actually wanted to see em like this shit
you know its been like a year and a half since ive seen an actual human female nipple
besides my moms
i saw it last month and it was sick
liat was two years ago
i guess so
she was insanely hot though
thats what sucks
how can that possibly suck
id be fuckin psyched if id gotten with a girl that hot
you got like two dozen handjobs
and three quarters of a blowjob but that was fuckin it
it was the peak of my ass gettin career and it happened way way way too early
youre like orson welles
if id built up to it id probably at least be having steady sex with a mediocre looking girl at this point
i honestly now see why orson welles ate his fat ass to death
youll have sex in college
and if not youll have the bang bus
but the key is to be good at sex by the time youre in college
you dont want girls to think you suck dick at fucking
i still think youve got a chance with jules
she got mad hot over last summer and clearly hasnt realized it cause she still flirts with you
are you joking man
lets see here
she dated dan remick matt muir josh corber and whats his face
all of those were cool guys
shes been hot way longer than you think
why would she end her high school career with me
well helen got with ariel shafir
yeah and he was a complete fucking loser
youre a step up from that
which is why you should stop being a pussy and do her
you could nailthe shit out of her for like two months before you leave
that bitch looks like a good fucker
im sick of you talking about her like that man
evan starts to walk out
what you can talk about that bitch all day every single day but i cant say one thing about her
i dont constantly insult her
i didnt insult her
i said she looks like a good fucker
she looks like she can take a dick
thats a good thing
some women pride themselves on their dick taking abilities
seth and evan come out the front doors
terry one of the rough looking smokers calls out
did you hear im having the big grad party
evan a little scared keeps his distance
terry spits on seths shirt
and youre not coming
tell your fucking faggot friend he cant come either
seth wipes the spit off
he looks at terry and seems as though hes about to say something but is interrupted when terry starts hocking up more spit
seth runs away as terry and his friends laugh
he catches up to evan and they head back to school
you really bitched out on that one
i bitched out
you bitched out
you were across the street before i even realized what was going on
beat that guys such a douche bag
there are guys standing behind the starting line of the schools track
we hear a teacher yell go
and the boys start running
we follow them from above
all the boys keep pretty much the same pace except for one runner who slowly lags behind
the group gets so far ahead of the him that he is alone in the frame
kneeling on the track breathing heavily
a moment later a kid with prosthetic leg jogs by
as he passes seth poo say
evan is sitting in math class staring at helens breasts
she s a very tall girl and is athletic in a sexy way wearing volleyball team sweat pants and a tank top
he looks up from her breasts to her face she is staring right at him
he immediately looks to the front of the class embarrassed
the bell rings and everyone leaves
helen walks up to evan as they enter the hallway
hes really nervous
she offers him a pen
hey evan thanks for the pen
oh dont worry no worries
just keep it
then youll just have it and you wont have to borrow another pen
i was going to ask you did you hear about terrys grad party
its going to be so insane
yeah its a maybe
but you know i gotta i got my
theres so much other fun shit that is going to be going on that night
so you know
but i like never see you at any parties or anything
because of all the other fun shit im off doing
so why werent you at dimitris party on saturday
didnt want to go because well i did other stuff
nervous he desperately thinks oh yeah
saturday night was awesome
the real version of evans story is shown through a montage of quick flashbacks
first my parents went out to a double feature so a bunch of people came over
seth is there
evan and him are surfing the bang bus web site
fogell arrives with a bottle of sambuca
fogell is one of those seniors who looks like hes thirteen years old
and we had a couple drinks in my basement
an empty bottle of sambuca in front of them and empty beer cans at their feet the three boys each shotgun a beer
and seths parents were having this cocktail party and we went over there to like mingle
seths parents are having a fancy cocktail party
the boys are drunk as hell
and there were actually some really interesting and like entertaining people there
the boys laugh hysterically as they each shake tobassco sauce onto their tongues
they writhe around in agony as several adults look at them like they are morons
and uh then we saw some uh live music
in seths basement the boys violently wrestle
evan gives fogell a bloody nose but they all cant help but laugh
then we went to a club downtown
the bouncer of a dirty strip club rejects them
and then we pretty much called it a night and went home
evan pukes all over seth
evan and fogell laugh hysterically as seth yells at them
we return to evan talking to helen in the halls
you wouldve loved it
that sounds so fun
i would love to go do something like that
well you know me and seth are always cooking up
helen is disappointed in his response
so are you guys going to the same school next year
we were going to but uh we got into different ones
what are you going to do without him
same shit ive always been doing
itll be fine
dont worry about it
students file into the home economics room
the blackboard reads today tiramisu
the ingredients are listed below
seth is talking to the cooking teacher
grier i joined this class because i thought id be cooking with a partner
its not fair
shes never here
i dont get twice the marks for doing all the work
i didnt invent odd numbers seth
look at evan
evan is playfully throwing flour at a tiny japanese boy
they both laugh hard
while im over in my unit isolated and alone eating my terrible tasting food because i cant even properly mix ingredients by myself i gotta look over at that
the japanese boy ties evans apron
evan then turns around and ties the boys apron
they both look happy
i wash and dry
and that is b
im like a single mother
well save it for next week
today jules partner isnt here either
pair up with her
the teacher walks away
seth looks over to station four nervous as hell
angle on jules well dressed and popular looking
she stands alone at station four laying out utensils
seth musters his courage and walks towards jules
he stops unsure of what to say
hey seth your partner didnt come again
thats kind of a personal question
it was my attempt at humour
well uh maybe i kidnapped her so youd be forced to work with me
theres my attempt at humour
well i would call that a success
reading recipe sheet marscampone
is that some kind of new cheese or something
all cheese tastes the same to me anyway
except blue cheese
that stuff is sick
my older brother always eats blue cheese
you know that stuff is actually moldy
like they tell you its moldy then they tell you to eat it anyway
well whoever they are they can eat my dick
jules watches as seth awkwardly removes the tiramisu from the oven and places it on the table
what are you doing tonight
i dont know probably nothing
my parents are out of town and im thinking of having a party
i dont know how big itll be but you should come anyways
that sounds fun
i love parties
i dont usually see you at them
its more of like a love hate thing
right now i love them though
how do i do this
ill write down my address and number
angle on evan
evan is standing by the sink scrubbing a tray
behind him at the table is the small japanese boy eating the tiramisu
thats good shit
seth walks up to evan
shes havin a fuckin party
angle on fogell entering the room whispering dont tell fogell about the party
hey guys i was walking here and on the way i saw nicola and she was wearing these tight white pants and a black g string and you could see
it right through the pants
we see fogell looking at the ass of nicola an incredibly hot girl who exudes sexual vibes and looks a little skanky you can see her black g string through
her tight white pants
she turns and notices fogell
he gives an awkward look
its nine thirty
back to fogell seth and evan
i told her what time it was
it was awesome
shes got the nicest ass
like youd know what to do with it
im really gonna miss your knee slappers when me and evan are at state
pissed yeah well ill be at junior college where the girls are half as smart and thus twice as likely to blow me
what are you guys doing tonight
youll just have to fingerbang yourself
to fogell what you doing
well seth always said i was too much of a pussy but he was wrong
its been arranged
at lunch im going to the same place mike snider went to pick up my brand new false identification card
thats perfect cause evan didnt you just say that you heard about a party
to evan why didnt you tell me
just be happy he told
now you can buy the booze
if youre not in this class leave this class
well done man
well see you after class
did you tell that nimrod youre not going to room with him
no not yet
you better man
that guy is a poon tang repellent
seth sees jules coming
seth dishes time
whats the hold up
were getting a fake id
well you two have four more years to cuddle so lets get to work
actually were going to different schools
youre cutting the cord
whats going to happen
what do people think is gonna happen
thats what i dont get
were not like dependent on each other
we met when we were we were fine before then
its not like we do everything together
seth and evan are eating together
so it looks like we get a little graduation party after all
i would do terrible things to get with jules tonight
id give my left foot to start dating helen
shes killin me
ah helens a bitch
evan slams his fist on the table
im fuckin sick of this shit man
why do you hate her
is there even an actual reason
because seriously im beginning you think you like her
i hate her
i was never going to tell you this story because i knew that if you heard it you would never want to get with helen but over the last few
weeks ive been having a hard time thinking of a reason not to
so here it is
helen and i went to elementary school together right
beat well in the third grade i had
an odd problem
for some reason i dont know why i used to have this thing
where i would
sit around all day and draw pictures of dicks
a montage of flashbacks of young seth age drawing pictures of dicks in various places
a park at home in a sandbox and finally in a school classroom
id just sit there for hours on end drawing dicks
i dont know what it was
i couldnt touch the pen to paper without it drawing a penis
no shit thats fucked up
here i am this little kid who cant stop drawing dicks to save his life
what does that have to do with helen
young seth is still sitting at his desk drawing penises
i was very secretive about this dick thing i had going after all even i thought i was a loon lord knows what other people would have thought
so i would take all my dick drawings and stick them in this muppet lunch box i had
we see young seth sticking a picture of a penis in a lunch box filled with pieces of paper
young seth is drawing however it is a different day
so one day i was finishing up a picture of a real big and veiny bastard when all of a sudden
young seth drops the picture of the dick off his desk
it floats down and hits the feet of a cute little girl young you hit helens foot with your dick
the little girl picks up the picture and looks at it with a truly disturbed look on her face
young seth grabs the picture from her and shoves it into his lunch box
well she fucking flipped
she started crying and shit
ratted me out
the principle finds my cock muppet lunch box and he fucking flips
a flashback of young seth sitting in the principles office
the muppet lunch box is open and the penis drawings are completely covering his desk
it turns out the principle was some crazy religious guy and he thought i was possessed by some dick devil or something
the principal puts his hand on seths head and begins praying for his soul
so he calls my parents and they make me go to a psychologist who kept asking me all these dick questions
my parents wouldnt even let me eat dick shaped foods for like months
no carrots no pop sicles no hot dogs
you know how many fucking foods are shaped like dick
half amazed half amused wow
thats really messed up
i cant even stand to look at her punk face
beat im going to go take a piss
seth finishes his piss
he goes over to the sink looks at it for a moment then walks out of the bathroom
just as seth turns the corner he sees jules nicola and shirley standing by their lockers
jules spots seth
there you are
jules turns and says goodbye to nicola who walks away
jules and shirley turn to meet seth
here i am
so youre coming to my party right
its fully on
should i not
no no no
i really want you to come
uh you did say you were getting a fake id or something is that right
im getting that
can you get us drinks
i dont know
half joking come on you scratch our backs well scratch yours
well funny thing about my back
its located on my cock
shirley is offended
jules laughs a little
seth laughs too hard
i can do that
what do you guys want
well this is actually like a big favor but well my parents gave me like a hundred bucks to feed myself for the week but the house if full of
food so i figure i should just spend all of it on extra drinks for the party
i would never even think of doing something that nice
jules hands seth a hundred dollars
well this is really nice of you
i mean i really appreciate this
seth cant believe what hes hearing
he can barely contain his smile
should i just get like a shitload of different shit
whatever shit you think people would like i dont really know
i want mikes hard lemonade
ill see you tonight
ill see you
the girls walk off leaving seth lost in thought
he suddenly runs down the hall
evan is standing alone amidst the rest of his gym class as they play soccer
evan get into the game
evan says nothing and the teacher soon redirects his attention elsewhere
evan sees seth jogging towards him
out of breath worked up man just evan listen to me
you know jules
you know what she just did
she came up to me and asked me if i would buy her alcohol
not just her her whole party
do you know what that means
it means that by some miracle we were paired up we talked and she actually thought of me afterwards
thought of me enough to decide that i was the guy that she was going to trust the fun ness of her party with
she wants me
she fucking wants my dick
did you ever think maybe shes just using you to get her alcohol
of course i thought of that
listen to the same scene as before with seth and jules in class
my older brother always eats blue cheese
you know that stuff is actually moldy
she has an older brother
she could have asked him but she asked me
she looked me straight in the face and asked me
she wants to fuck me man
do you understand that
today is the day that fucking has become possible
are you stupid
youre not going to be able to sleep with her tonight
shes going to be at the party shes gonna be drunk and she likes me at least a little so i can get with her
then i make her my girlfriend and then i fuck her all summer long
then by the time college rolls around im the fuckin fucking master man
make her your girlfriend
so hypnosis love potion or mind control helmet
once ive gotten with her i write her love letters flowers ill do anything ill be the most pussy whipped guy in the universe what chick wouldnt go out with
a guy like that
the soccer ball rolls towards them
they both watch as it rolls by
what the hell evan
evan shrugs back
fuck you man
fuck off greg
why dont you piss your pants again
that was like eight years ago asshole
he runs off
to evan wanna hear the best part
sarcastic oh i havent
evan looks upset assuming that seth is about to trash talk helen as usual
you do the same thing man
buy helen her alcohol
then tonight when you guys are both drunk get with her
this is the last party were ever going to go to as high school people
ive fully ignored my hatred for helen in coming up with this which is a big ass deal
we need to stop being pussy and for once just goes balls out man
evan seems to be swayed
i should get helen alcohol
itll be pimp and then you know shell be drunk
have you talked to fogell
you talk to helen ill find that retard fogell
everyone is rushing to class
evan hurries through the halls and finds helen at her locker
did you hear about the party tonight
yeah i just heard
it sounds sweet
youre not coming are you
no no i am
thats why i came looking for you
me and some guys are going to the liquor store after class so i was thinking i could buy you yours if you needed someone to
thatd be great thatd save me such a hassle cause i was going to beg my sister but yeah could you get me like a bottle of goldschlager
ill pay you back tonight
you will absolutely not
its my treat
evan swings a friendly little punch at helens shoulder but someone walks into him causing him to nail her in directly in the tit
you punched my tit
mortified im sorry
im so sorry
i just wanted to give you a friendly nudge in the arm you know
im so sorry
giggling dont worry about it
so ill see you at the party
ill see you then
im so sorry about that
seth is waiting angrily in front of the school
evan comes out the front doors
that douche bag isnt back yet ive been standing here with my thumb up my ass
i did it dude
i even offered to pay for it
it was pimp
that is fucking pimp
why didnt i do that
the bell rings
seth and evan work side by side in the woodshop
yelling over the machines thats what we get for trusting a mental midget
hes fucking it all up
i bet he pussied out just like i said he would
seth and evan walk out the front door
i mean what are we going to tell the girls
sorry we couldnt do what we promised because were dickless incompetents
well never get laid because of that little ass fuck
how did he get in to state
hes got shit for brains
how else can we get liquor
seth and evan turn around to see fogell running after them
where have you been
you almost gave me a goddamn heart attack
you better fucking have it where is it
i got it
its great man look
fogell reaches into his pocket and pulls out the fake id
evan grabs it
reading the card okay mr
what kind of a stupid name is that
what are you trying to be an irish r b singer
well they let you pick any name you want when you get there
so you picked mclovin
it was between that or muhammad
why was it between that or muhammad
why didnt you just pick a common name
actually seth muhammad is the most commonly used name on earth
have you ever actually met a guy named muhammad
have you actually ever met a guy named mclovin
thats why you picked a bad name
you probably have federal agents tracking you for even considering the name muhammad on a fake id
look at this shit man you dont even have a first name
it just says name one name
i just thought mclovin sounded old and the chicks would dig it
under what circumstances would you ever have to show a chick your id
she could ask
or i could just show it to her
i dont believe this
this says youre fucking
why didnt you just put
i knew you would ask that
look every day dozens of kids roll into the liquor store with fake ids trying to act like joe casual
each and every one of these kids just so happens to be years old
just how many year olds do you think there are
its not terrible
this might work but its up to you fogell
theyll either think oh its another punk kid with a fake id
or look its mclovin the twenty five year old organ donor
whats it gonna be
fogell takes a deep breath
i am mclovin
youre not mclovin
no ones mclovin and this is never going to work
we need a new way to get alcohol
could we drive to canada or something
i still think its going to work
they walk into the staff parking lot
what the fuck
wheres my car
i told you man
what did i say
i told you that was a dumb idea
why would you park in the staff shut up fogell
cause youre not staff
i am aware of that fagell
seth storms off
evan follows him
yelling will you still pick me up from work
evan and seth round the corner leaving fogell behind
lets go to your house
seth puts on a shirt that is way too small and hes wearing pants that are too tight
evan is playing the video game grand theft auto
now we wait for your mom to piss off and steal your parents booze like your brother always does
take a bit from every bottle
piece of cake
its not exactly what jules wanted but itll do right
just wear what you wore to school
i told you i cant do that
i cant let jules see me in the same shit i wore at school
its completely unbecoming
why dont you just go to your house and get your own clothes
cause this is stupid
i cant go home
then my mom will know the car got towed and ill be grounded tonight
ill just stay here all weekend and pick it up on monday
re video game where the fuck is the dirt bike
beat ah screw it
im just gonna kill everyone
dont you have bigger clothes
see what my dads got
seth is wearing evans dads clothes a s style cowboy shirt just barely pulling it off as well as slacks
not bad eh
its like and my moms still here
alright heres what well do
ill fuck your mom in the basement while you steal the liquor
fuck you asshole
lets just sneak down there and grab it
evan and seth carrying an empty two liter bottle of coke cautiously descend the creaking staircase
their eyes watch the tv room where evans mom is on the phone
the boys enter the dining room and cautiously open the liquor cabinet
seth enthusiastically reaches for a bottle
whispering alright dude
get ready to receive
evan begins unscrewing his bottle when he notices a little black line marking where the liquor bottle is filled to
then he realizes that every bottle has it
whispering i cant believe it
they marked them
whispering what do you mean they
your parents are fuckers
what do we do now
take some and fill it back up with water
get ready ill get water
evan hurries off
seth looks at the liquor cabinet trying to choose the best booze
he grabs a massive bottle of gin
that stuff is literally undrinkable
whispering its the biggest bottle you douche
just do it
shes right in the other room
evan reluctantly holds an empty coke bottle as seth shakily pours the gin in
evan starts refilling the gin bottle with water when suddenly they both hear his mom coming
whispering but the booze
whispering take it
seth runs off with the gin and coke bottle
evan quickly closes the cabinet and sneaks off right before his mom enters
through the window she sees that seth is already on the front lawn and thinks nothing of it
love you sweety
evan and seth triumphantly walk away
seth holds up the gin
look at this mother
smell its glory
he opens it up and takes a whiff
barely a scent
he takes a crazy big swig
i always said i had the highest alcohol tolerance
im like superman
seth taste another swig but makes a strange face
evan grabs the bottle and takes a swig
its fucking water
drinks again fuck
your brother beat us to the punch
we have to go back
we cant go back
she totally knew shell bust us for sure and we have to meet fogell
text your brother hes a stupid piece of crap
evan pulls out his cell and chuckles as he types
evan and seth walk off the bus
they see fogell walking towards them
hes in his uniform holding a hanger with a shirt and a vest
what the hell is that
youre gonna look like a pinocchio
its just a vest
how many high schoolers you see in vests
eyeing shopwells you know they got a ton of liquor right in there
if we get it now we can get to the party faster with all of jules shit
i work there
they know im not twenty five
nobody said anything about you dick mouth
you have one name on your id
its out of the equation
and now im gonna have to take drastic measures
im gonna steal the booze
you cant do that
mocking yeah right
and that way i give jules back her money like you did with helen
that was good thinking thats fucking pimp
thats how you seal a deal
it wont be hard
remember dan vertlieb stole a keg from here and hes got like really bad scoliosis
youre not gonna steal it
fogell hes not going to steal it
dont do this
ill get the liquor later
im stepping up
and once im up i dont step back down
maybe you state boys dont understand that
seth walks to the store
seth enters the store looking determined
he spots a security guard standing by one of the registers
to himself hope piggy can run
he walks past the registers which brings him in front of the long liquor aisle
he surveys the scene
there is an old woman browsing the shelves
seth looks over to the registers
seth is at the cash register
he has a huge amount of booze in the conveyor belt
how old are you
you certainly are
thatll be eighty dollars
seth hands the cashier a big eighty dollar bill
thank you kindly
youre welcome seth
seth still standing in front of the liquor aisle shakes his head
he eyeballs the old lady
the old lady is browsing
she drops her big purse
a hand reaches down and picks it up
excuse me maam
you dropped your purse
would you like me to help you to your car
that would be lovely young man
would you like me to buy you alcohol
that would be lovely
seth holding two huge bags of liquor waves to the old lady as she drives away
enjoy your remaining years
enjoy fucking jules
seth shakes his head
he looks down the aisle again takes a breath and starts walking
he arrives at a fancy looking bottle
he takes it and looks down at it in his hands
a big golden label reads dont do it kid
we see that the security guard is right behind him
seth doesnt look up he just stares at the bottle dramatically
i never had a choice
he throws the bottle at the guards face
the guard blocks it with his billy club grabs another bottle and hurls it at seth
seth dodges it by an inch the bottle hits the old lady in the head
in agony before seth can do anything the guard smashes a ounce bottle of beer across his face
the guard swings the broken end of the bottle and cuts seths throat
blood spurts out
seth drops his bottles and falls to the ground
evan and fogell are talking
oh and uh my mom said we can have the tv from her basement and ive got like three lava lamps and one strobe light so like we can have
that in the room evan sees seth coming out of shopwells
you still didnt tell him were rooming no
to seth so wheres all the stolen liquor
i was gonna do it but security was tight as shit
i was gonna do it though dont think i wasnt
lets go to the liquor store and try your stupid id
seth heads towards the bus stop
im gonna put my vest back in my locker
more mind blowingly badass funk music over seth evan and fogell sitting on the bus amidst a bunch of gloomy unpleasant looking strangers
nothing happens whatsoever
the bus stops in front of the liquor store and the guys get out
well here we are
fogell are you ready
heres the list
were getting girls their booze so theyll get with us
i put a lot of thought into that list
its the perfect party bar so dont mess it up and get sambuca again
fogell reads the list
a worried look sweeps across his face
ouzo drambuie jager gold shlay ger goldschlager
thats for helen so do not forget it
alize captain morgan rum smirnoff rasberry and a big ass bottle of popov
oh yeah and mikes hard lemonade
this is too much
i cant get away with this much
whats the difference
seth hands fogell the money
i dont know man
im getting like really nervous
fogell starts breathing very hard and making an odd noise while doing so
are you okay
what the hell are you doing
i dont know if i want to do this
what are you talking about
you just promised you would
what is this shit
what if they turn me down
then were in the same place that were in right now
its fucking humiliating
everyone in the store sees them kicking me out
what if they make me put all the liquor back on the shelf
i cant do that
this whole thing is bigger than you asshead
just go in there and buy the damn alcohol
what if i dont feel like it anymore
then i will kill you
if you dont buy the alcohol i will kill you
killing me wont get you any alcohol jerkoff
im the one with the id
then i will kill you cut off your ugly face put it over mine and buy it my fucking self
you dont have the technology or the steady hands to pull off a procedure like that
seth stands for a moment then suddenly rushes fogell
evan stands between them and breaks it up
seth calm down
fogell stop being a baby and go buy the alcohol
you said youd do it so do it
its why you bought the id so just go do it
beat ill try
fogell walks into the store
at first it all seems overwhelming
fogell is confused dizzy and sweating
he steps behind a large beer display and takes a few deep breaths
fogell flinches shocked someone spoke to him
he keeps walking
he nears a mother and her year old son
as fogell passes them the son seems to recognize him
fogell clearly recognizes the son
their eyes meet
fogell looks in the opposite direction
weird voice covering his face no
whatre you doing here
weird voice uh
whisper shut up moscovitch
you dont know me
knowingly oh oh
he puts his head down and quickly walks away
he arrives at the beer and cooler section
clearly intimidated he slowly opens a beer fridge
he grabs one beer attached to a six pack and pulls it forward
the beer comes loose in his hand as the other five fall to the ground cracking on impact and spraying beer all over the place
fogell scrambles to stop the beers from spraying but soon finds that it is impossible
a clerk approaches fogell
is there a problem sir
umm nope no problem whatsoever
pointing to the beer on the floor sir did you do this
on the floor
beat i think it happened before
fogell is standing in a puddle of beer with beer sprayed all over his legs holding a can of beer
are you sure
i think i would know thank you
fogell walks away
fogell has a shopping cart filled with booze
he gets in line to pay
he looks ahead to the old looking guy who is currently at the cashier woman paying
um yes may i please see some id
i havent been id ed in years
anyone who looks under thirty five
the guy looks through his wallet
fogell nervously watches
seth and evan peek through one of the stores front windows
its a good id right
mike snider never had a problem
beat did you remember a condom
you brought a condom
yeah i figured you know might as well
i brought one of those little things of spermicidal lube too
he takes them out of his pocket
you laughed in my face when i said wed be having sex tonight
it doesnt mean you shouldnt be prepared
you didnt even bring one
that wasnt the plan
we had a plan
i cant believe you did that without even consulting me about it
i dont really even understand what your plan is
im gonna go down on her for like hours
shell love that
shell want to go out with that
yeah but i figured theres no harm in bringing just one little condom
and one little bottle of spermicidal lube
you cant let her know you brought that
these girls are not dried up old ladies
theyre ready to go
i wont bring the lube
fogell pushes his stuff up to the cashier
she looks at him kind of funny
reading name tag mindy
she rings up a six pack of budweiser
oh i love that stuff
been drinking it for years
i heard they recently decided to start adding more hops
fogell just nods kind of proud of himself
she stops ringing stuff up and looks at him
umm okay sir im gonna need to see some identification
seth and evan are still leaning against the window
do you think i could get helen to do some kind of long distance thing
seth looks as if he sees something in the distance
he stands upright
its cary hutchins
i havent seen her since she switched schools
she had the biggest tits in the universe
down the block there is a girl walking a dog
i heard she had breast reduction surgery
her tits must be crazy perfect now
i gotta see these bastards
lets check em out
seth and evan run off towards the girl
man im gonna pretend to trip and grab em
beat i hope theyve healed
the cashier is still examining the card
she hands it back to fogell
that comes to a total of
a huge smile forms on fogells face as he pulls out a wad of money and hands it to the cashier
she starts to gather his change when suddenly a big guy runs up and punches fogell right in the side of the head
fogell falls to the ground
the dude sticks his hand in the open register grabs a handful of money and runs
the whole thing is over in a matter of seconds
fogell is on the ground dazed and confused
what the hell happened
fogell sees the distressed cashier frantically dialing the police
breathing hard i dont believe it
i dont believe it
seth and evan walk down the street towards the liquor store
that was a waste
but she fully looked way better before
i thought when they reduced them they just kind of reshaped them nicer
made them more supple
i cant even begin to imagine the justification for making breasts smaller
its like me making my nuts saggier
evan sees something in the distance
check it out
they see a cop car with the lights flashing parked outside the liquor store
seth and evan cautiously approach the liquor store and look inside
they see two police talking with the cashier and fogell is standing right beside them
they busted fogell
the two police officer slater and experienced and officer michaels and learning are talking to the cashier
fogell stands beside them nervous and afraid
to cashier so did he punch anyone else
losing it completely i cant do this okay
i told you i have an exam tomorrow
can you understand that
a goddamn exam
the cashier breaks down crying and walks off to the back of the store
the officers look at each other
apparently she has an exam
then they turn to fogell
turn to fogell so then son youre the one that got punched
fogell looks down to his bags of liquor at his feet
then back at the cops
wed like to ask you a couple questions
the officers each take out a note pad and a pencil
okay first things first
whats your name
fogell looks like his heart is about to explode out of his chest
my name its
tripping over his own words mc
no no i said mclovin
the officers both write down some information
and your first name
fogell looks twice as scared
a good one
fogell trails off mumbling and starts to breathe heavily making an odd noise
behind him in the window of the store we see seth and evan peeking through
shocked seth and evan walk away from the window
seth starts to pace in anger
i dont believe this bullshit
this isnt happening
i didnt even know you could get arrested for this shit
we need that fucking liquor
oh my god
are they gonna take him downtown
he got arrested
were on our own
we need a new way of getting liquor
how much money can you get
what are you talking about
what about fogell
that doesnt matter anymore
i just lost a hundred dollars of jules money
we have to help him
what are we gonna do
bust him out of jail
i dont even know where jail is
what we need is the alcohol which is impossible because we dont have any fucking money
seth steps into the driveway leading to the parking lot
we need to think
we need to think
we need to act
suddenly a car pulls out of the lot going mph and knocks seth down
the cops are still talking to fogell
he looks completely flustered
hes lost his composure
okay your name is just mclovin theres no need to get irrational
in the background not in the view of fogell and the cops we see driver of the car a shady looking guy in a hockey jersey gets out of his
car and walks over to where seth is lying apologizing frantically
a lot of people have strange names these days
i once arrested a man lady who was legally named pearl necklace
i changed my name
i was going to be a singer
thats not illegal
and how old are you mclovin
fogell looks down at the bags of booze again
old enough for what
can i see your id
fogell takes his shaking sweaty hand sticks it in his pocket and pulls out his fake id
he slowly hands it over to officer slater
the cops both look at it then fogell
beads of sweat are running down fogells face
in the background seth pops up and starts kicking the guys car out of anger
evan and the driver both restrain seth
youre an organ donor
i didnt want to be one but my wife insisted
just like a woman
even after youre dead they want to tear your heart out
the officers start laughing
fogell is shocked
they hand back the id
im really sorry but i dont really have any information
i didnt really see him
his fist hit here
fogell points at his giant black eye
are you in a hurry or something
i kinda had to catch a bus
where were you going
near thirteenth and granville
well take you there get your information on the way
fogell is completely dumbfounded
the driver is pleading with seth and evan
im so sorry man
im so sorry
i didnt see you at all
are you okay
are you okay
im sorry man
look what can i do
are you okay
the driver glances at the cop car
i mean please dont report me we can figure this out okay
why wouldnt i report you
because ill do anything
what can i do
you have any money
quietly to seth what are you doing
just take it
the driver reaches into his pocket and hands seth some money
seth looks at it
its seven dollars
what is this
this isnt enough
seth stuffs the money in his pocket
its all i have
well you just came from the liquor store give us your liquor
i didnt get any
theyre not letting anyone in
theyre arresting someone or something
well theyll be arresting somebody else if you dont do something quick
its killing me
seth acting poorly pretends hes way more hurt than he is
okay you want alcohol
i can get you alcohol
im on my way to this party right now
theres gonna be tons of liquor
i will definitely get you plenty
whoa whoa whoa
seth goes over to evan
what are you doing
jules money is gone fogells out weve got no other option
i dont like this idea at all
im just not feeling it
that guys fucking creepy
just look at him
they look at the driver who is staring at evan with a dumb expression on his face
to evan you know a guy named jimmy perchance
cause you totally look like his brother
hes an idiot
and hes our only hope
come on dont break your promise to helen
the drivers car pulls away with seth and evan sitting in the back seat
a few moments later the cops walk out with fogell right behind them carrying the bags of liquor
to fogell man that lady just wouldnt stop crying huh
and youre the one that got punched
did you hear her say she has an exam tomorrow
boo fuckin hoo
am i right
could we have taken her in
just to scare the shit out of her
probably could have found a way
but a good general rule is only take people in you want to ride with
and whiny bitches dont make that cut
the cops chuckle as they all get in the cop car
seth and evan sit in the back seat
the driver is in the front
one of you bros could have sat up here with me
there is an awkward silence when suddenly seth starts to wriggle in discomfort
seth fishes his cell phone out of his pocket and looks at it
thinking holy shit
seth answers the phone
whats the haps
who is it
there are six girls passing two beers in a circle while dancing blissfully to crappy s music
where are you
i just got in a cab and im going to the liquor store as we speak
i cant wait for you to get here
a huge smile sweeps across seths face
it looks like it could actually be a great party
i think like tons of people might show up
i hope they dont trash my house
well if they want to do that theyre going to have to get through me
so i guess i dont have to worry then
ill see you soon
seth hangs up the phone completely elated
she called man
shes practically begging for it
she said i cant wait for you to get here
that sounds like she fully wants it
wheres she gonna get it from huh my man
seth and evan are very weirded out
the drivers car pulls up in front of a house
the three get out
hey are you sure that its cool were here
im essentially best friends with this guy
a whole bunch of my buddies are coming
the driver runs into the house happily seth and evan following closely behind
the boys enter the house and stand by the front door of the huge party
its in full swing with all sorts of random looking people
nobody is under the age of
this is weird
just act casual
all we gotta do is find the booze and haul ass out of here
as they make their way down a hallway a few people give them looks
they enter the kitchen where seth spots what theyve been looking for
there are big buckets of ice filled with beer coolers wine vodka everything
lets grab one of these buckets and go
what the fuck do you think youre doing
the guys turn and see that in corner of the kitchen the driver holding a phone is being yelled at by a massive brute mark
you calling more of your stupid friends again
mark calm down okay
get the fuck out of my house
mark come on
what the heck
dont be a dick
suddenly mark grabs the driver by the back of the neck and drags him out of the kitchen down the front hall and out the door
a group of people follow including seth and evan
the driver get pushed out of the door and lands on the front lawn
seth and evan watch from the doorway of the house a group of people in front of them
this is bullshit
just chi mark steps on the drivers hand
the driver takes his hand out from under marks foot
he stands up
fuck you man
ill fucking do this
suddenly mark becomes enraged
he takes a big step forward and brutally kicks the driver square in the nuts
the driver clutches his nuts and falls to the ground
francis you and your idiot friends stay the away from me and mine or ill flipping shiv your ass
mark and his buddies head back in leading them towards seth and evan who quickly duck back into the party
the frightened boys walk into one of the first rooms and hide in the corner
they have a hushed discussion
dude lets slip out the back
come on were here
lets just hurry up and do this
you want to end up like that guy
not me i need my nuts
we need this liquor
you need it
i dont need it
im going to tell helen i like her and then maybe shell get with me not after i get her stinking drunk
then why havent you ever made a move you pussy
because i respect her
im not going to put that kind of unfair pressure on her
these arent girls theyre women
they need our dicks as much as we need their poons and we all love liquor so wheres the fucking beef
were leaving okay
these guys could kill us
you want to get killed for liquor
youre really gonna bail on me
rolls eyes jesus
evan walks out the door
if thats how youre going to be then ill get the booze on my own
and youre not getting any
and neither is helen
seth storms off
fogell sits in the backseat
the cops are in the front
there is silence for a few beats
i could answer those uh questions now if you want
we get the gist of it
you were buying some beer some guys came in and robbed the place
i dont think were gonna find em this time
the officers start to chuckle
it was only one guy
only one guy
well fuck that
we could never catch one guy
you see mclovin if it was two guys wed have twice the chance of catching one of them
but just one guy
i mean how are we supposed to find one guy in this whole city
you know how many people there are in this city
i have trouble finding people i know
arent you guys supposed to be trained or something
dont you have a computer
yeah that stuff can help but if someone walks up to me on the street and is like hey find bob
well how the hell am i supposed to do that
if i dont know who he is then how am i supposed to know where he is
when youre new to the force like i am only six months in
proudly i got two and a half years under my belt
you learn a lot of crazy stuff
for example the car radio goes off
we have a at east and montgomery
its baileys bar and grill
car respond please
slater picks up the receiver
hangs up nice
ya see michaels when ever theres a call for a bar you take it
good fucking call sir
we got a situation at baileys
we have to see to that but well drop you off right after
michaels hits the siren and they drive off
seth is looking in the fridge which is full of beer
an enormous guy nudges seth aside and sticks his arm in
hey mark you want another beer
seth quickly walks away from the fridge and goes down the hall
seth enters a room of people dancing to hip hop
he notices all the girls are drinking mikes hard lemonade and then locates a cooler full of it across the dance area
he tries to make his way through the sea of dancing
a hot sorority type woman drunk out off her ass dances over to him and starts grinding against his leg
he doesnt know how to react so he just goes with it bumpin and grindin with the girl
evan is walking down an alley mad as hell when suddenly he jumps up and starts squirming
he takes out his vibrating cell phone and looks at the callers name
he looks intensely at the cell as it continues vibrating
here we go
he presses talk
through the phone with horrible static eva
the phone cuts out
evan sees that he has no reception
he looks back at the party then at his cell phone
he shakes his head and turns back towards the party
the cops and fogell get out of the car and walk towards the baileys
they stop before they enter
alright mclovin this will only take a few minutes
just grab a beer at the bar and well be done before you know it
a little scared well
whats goin on in there
the officers chuckle as they lead fogell into the bar
as they enter the bar they immediately see a drunken crazed homeless guy screaming at a bar tender
you didnt see me pissin anywhere
fogell quickly sits at the bar by the entrance to the kitchen
ive got your back
show this rummy how we roll
officer michaels walks up to the homeless guy
the homeless guy turns and sees the cops
he runs for the front door
michaels blocks the door and the homeless guy rams into him knocking him to the ground
sarcastic good one michaels
slater runs at the homeless guy and chases him into the dining area
the homeless guy knocks over a table which slater trips over
nervous should i shoot him
the homeless guy makes a mad dash for the kitchen and fogell is the only one in his way
stop him mclovin
the homeless guy rams straight into him and knocks both of them onto the kitchen floor
the kitchen staff watch in awe as the homeless guy wrestles fogell on the ground
stop you fucking bum
the homeless guy gets up grabs fogell and hurls him into a rack of trays
he then turns to run but slips on a wet spot and slams his head against the ground
the cops burst into the room to find fogell panting on his knees with the homeless guy unconscious on the floor
i am buying you a beer mclovin
an r b slow jam plays as an exuberant seth a mikes hard lemonade in one hand and the womans ass in the other as the dancing becomes increasingly sexual
as the song ends the woman moves on
seth glances at the cooler and sees one more mikes hard
he grabs it and puts it in his pocket
the bulge is apparent
extremely pleased with himself seth walks into the adjacent room
there are a bunch of guys chilling on the couch who all look at seth oddly as he enters
hey wut up
the guys just nod at seth and continue to look at him strangely
what is that
is that red wine
thinking hes busted seth quickly covers the bulge in his pocket
i dont know what youre talking about
that shit you spilled all over yourself idiot
sincere i didnt spill anything on myself
seth checks himself to see what the guy is referring to
on seths upper thigh there is a red splotch about the size of a palm of a hand
what the hell is this
oh my lord
you were just dancing in there right
the guys all burst out laughing
its fucking blood
why would i get blood on my leg from beat of realization the guys start laughing even harder
some girl perioded on my fucking leg
ive never seen that before in my life
seth pokes at the splotch
that is disgusting
guy gets up as seth tries to cover up the mess with his shirt
i gotta show this to bill
dont show bill
i cant believe this is happening
we should find who did it
this is un fucking believable
i have to look good tonight
whod you dance with
who gives a shit
these arent even my pants
guy brings six more guys including the enormous guy into the room
he points out the stain seths pants
all the guys burst out laughing
embarrassed and fearful of the attention seth starts making his way out of the room
its really funny huh
yuk it up assholes
seth works his way through another room full of people shielding the splotch as best as he can
check it out
that guys having his period
another group of people turn and laugh
he looks about the right age
to himself i gotta clean this shit
he sees a long line of people standing if front of the bathroom door
he spots a staircase and runs down into the basement
seth enters the empty basement
he sees a sink and runs over to it and turns on the water
evan nervously walks back into the house to look for a telephone
the cops fogell and the unconscious homeless guy each sit at the bar with a corona in front of them
slaters radio goes off
calling all units armed and dangerous man in the vicinity of click
slater turns his radio down ignoring the calls
so anyways we leave the bar im charmin her pants off telling her stories of shoot outs and shit
youve been in shoot outs
mclovin all we do is bonk homeless people on the head
youre practically a cop now
so i pull up in front of her house and she asks me to come inside for some coffee
of course i say yes
so we go into the kitchen
i start taking off my clothes she fucking flips starts screaming at me and im like cant have coffee without cream
i fucking said that
then she slaps me throws me out
im telling you mclovin stay out of bars
hey you dont need to tell me
so yeah you gotta look in different places

i met the missus at paint ball
can you believe that
i shot her in the neck and we just hit it off
and my first wife who is a whore where do you think we met
i dont know
i find theyre always good for a little quick ass
the cops laugh
i bet i know your trick mclovin
you do the whole mysterious guy thing right
yeah mclovin hows it going with the ladies
fogell thinks for a moment he is feeling rather comfortable
well officers its not the going with the ladies i care about its the coming
the cops and fogell burst out laughing
mclovin in the house
he sees that the cops clearly like him his confidence level increased he takes a chance
you guys got guns huh
the officers glance at each other as sinister smiles creep across their faces
we got guns
i havent had one for long but man let me tell you its like having two dicks
can i hold one
michaels and slater look to each other
i mean if we took the bullets out
slater pulls out his gun and takes out the clip
fogell takes the unloaded gun and flops it back and forth in his hands a huge smile gleaming
ive never held one
are they hard to shoot
if youre michaels they are
he cant shoot worth dick
fuck you old man
i could out shoot you with my sack tucked between my legs
only one way to settle this
incredibly excited you guys are going to shoot something right
seth is scrubbing at the mark on his thigh but its not doing much
he stops for a moment to take a breather as he looks around the basement
he spots a fridge in the corner and walks over to it
as he opens it a look of awe sweeps across his face
every shelf is completely filled with beer
he grabs as many bottles as he can and starts sticking them in his pockets when he notices two large jugs of detergent next to the washer
he thinks for a moment then begins to empty out the detergent jugs
evan peers into a vacant room and sees a telephone
he nervously enters and picks up the phone
helen is in a cab with becca her best friend and two other girls
theyre a little done up and really giggly
helens cell phone starts ringing
she hushes the other girls as she answers her phone
is it him
whispering to the girls shut up
i had bad reception
are you at the party
no im in a cab
ill be there soon
are you still coming
um about your goldschlager
evan can hear all the girls goofing around and giggling
whispering to the girls shut up
whats going on there
oh nothing i just wanted to make sure you were still coming you know and that you didnt get caught up at a cocktail party or some club
im gonna be there
well i cant wait to see you
i think its going to be a real fun
evan hangs up the phone
a huge smile crosses his face
as he turns around to exit five older unbelievably drunk dudes wander into the room
theyre going to kill that guy man
that bitchs boyfriend is so pissed
and hes a beast
they start pouring a baggy of coke on the table when one of them notices evan standing in the corner
was it you
are you the guy
the kid with the splotch on his crotch
evan glances down at his crotch
he is confused and horrified
i know you
i know that guy he was at that party with me
hes jimmys brother
the dude with the crazy raps the one i told you about
they draw the coke into lines as evan slowly heads for the door
oh no thats not me either
wrong guy man
dude gets up and blocks the door
no thats you man
you are fully jimmys brother
you were just so messed up you cant remember
trust me man
that wasnt me
i dont even listen to rap

i know it
ive been telling these guys about you
just give them one rap
they start doing the lines of coke
evan is very afraid
seth is finishing pouring the beer bottles into the second detergent jug
there are about thirty empty beer bottles laying around seth
he tightens the cap picks up the two detergent jugs and heads upstairs
seth emerges from the basement and heads towards the front door
i did it man
peace out tro
hes inches away from the front door when suddenly
thats the guy
seth turns and sees mark the guy who assaulted the driver walking towards him
he notices mark has a splotch on his leg too
you got one too
were blood brothers
shut it you little shitter
what the hell were you doing dancing with jacinda
horrified seth scrambles for excuses
i didnt dance with her
i dont even dance
never even tried it
point at seths splotch then where did that come from asshole
i dont know
maybe me and you rubbed up against each other at some point
how am i supposed to know
the coked up dudes are watching evan intensely
they are completely loving his rapping completely into it
evan is struggling
bitches and gats bitches and gats what do all of wes got
bitches and gats
when we steal all the money
bitches and gats
i kill the whores of vice city with my magnum take out the punk pigs with my glok design drink a fifth of hennessy and get benign fuck all the
bitches with their asses fine cheering oh
some guy bursts into the room
looks like a fight
dude does a line of coke and they all get up together and charge out of the room
there is a crowd gathered around seth and mark
the enormous guy and marks friends are gathered beside mark
i swear to god it wasnt me
evan and the four dudes who were doing coke walk into the room
evan is shocked to see seth at the center of so much commotion
mark notices the detergent bottle in seths hands
and what the fuck is this
and what are you doing with it
uh i got blood on my pants
mark sees the bottle of mikes hard lemonade in seths pocket and takes it out
he looks at it then looks at seth with a look of death
i brought them from home
suddenly mark violently shoves seth and throws the beer bottle at his face
seth holds up a detergent jug and deflects the beer bottle
it flies towards evan who ducks and nails dude in the head glass exploding everywhere
dude clutches his bloody head as the other dudes charge at mark
a full on brawl breaks out
everyone starts fighting
two of the dudes beat on the enormous guy
they throw him into evan
evan reluctantly holds the enormous guy up as the two dudes pound on him
angle on seth cowering in the corner mark runs at seth and is about to punch him when suddenly dude tackles him onto the kitchen island
seth turns and faces marks girlfriend jacinda
she grabs a lamp still plugged in and swings it at seth
she hits him square in the chest and the light bulb explodes
you ruined my birthday
you humiliated me
youre the one who used my leg as a tampon
she charges at him again arms flailing
seth scurries around the room shielding the blows with the detergent bottles
evan throws the enormous guy to the ground and runs
evan backs off spots seth and follows him out of the party
as seth and evan run up the block together jacinda talks into her cell phone
yeah fifth and paysview please hurry
the cops and fogell stand beside the car
the homeless guy is sleeping in the back
michaels has his gun drawn and is carefully aiming at a distant stop sign
youve been saying some bold words my friend
better not mess up
you can do it officer
michaels blasts off a round which punches a hole right through the center of the o in the stop sign
boo yaka sha
suck it slater
suck my nuts
long but gentle
and eat his ass
they all laugh hysterically
can i shoot one
the cops look at each other and shrug
slater hands fogell the gun when suddenly a siren can be heard in the distance getting closer
slater grabs the gun out of the disappointed fogells hand and holsters it
they all hop into the car
michaels kicks it into drive and they peel out
fogell shoves the unconscious homeless guy over
so dudes what do we do now
suddenly the car radio goes off
we got a at fifth and paysview all units in the area report to fifth and paysview
the cops stop and listen
son of a bitch
picks up radio car ten four
hangs up ya dumb whore
what does that mean
we gonna get to shoot anyone
probably some lame house party
well drop you off after
lets show these fuckers how we roll
seth and evan are running down the sidewalk
they both slow to a stop to catch their breath
the party is nowhere in sight
wheezing heavily huff
you fuckin prick
bailed on me
no i didnt
of course you did
we were supposed to do something and you left instead of doing it
thats the definition of bailing
if you said we should burn our dicks off and i didnt thats not bailing
it is bailing if you promised to burn your dick off
the bottom line is youre a bailer
you just bailed on me you bailed on me this morning when terry spat on me and youre bailing on me next year
there it is
it finally comes out
we were supposed to go to college together
since elementary school
what ever happened to that
what happened to that is that youre too stupid to get into the schools i did
i was not too stupid i was too lazy
youve wasted all my time you selfish bastard
instead of chasing girls and making friends i threw away the last three years talking bullshit with you
and now because of you im going to college a fucking friendless virgin
seth cant believe it
hes extremely hurt
getting with a girl wont make you any less of a loser next year
you talking to me or yourself
you fucking loser
seth drops one of the tide bottles and shoves evan hard
evan shoves him back
michaels pounds on the keypad of the little cop computer with his fist
how do they expect us to work these things while were driving
i cant even work my imac while im sitting at my desk
so like what does that computer do
pretty much anything if youre smart enough to figure it out
like who do you really hate
gimme a name
my french teacher
can i do it
michaels bring her file up then punches a few buttons and smiles
what did you do
graham will have a boot on her car
fogell laughs his ass off
i hate my dad too
the place should be around here somewhere
mclovin are the numbers on that side odd or even
its too dark out
we got flashlights
slater gets his flashlight and points it out the window
i wasnt even sure light came out of those things
i thought they were just cool looking clubs
michaels and slater start making light saber noises and pretend to fight with their flashlights
we see the cop car going down the street
evan and seth are a block down shoving each other
slater turns and points his flashlight out michaels window accidentally shining the light into his eyes
he jerks the wheel
seth swings at evan with the giant detergent jug
evan dodges it and shoves seth hard
seth stumbles onto the road and gets hit by the cop car
seth flies up onto the hood smashing the windshield
the car screeches to a halt and seth slides off the front of the car
seth lies motionless still holding one of the detergent jugs
the cap is knocked loose and beer is spilling all over the place
everyone in the car is looking forward stunned
they cant see out the front window as it is shattered
fogell has no clue who the victim was
shit shit shit
i dont believe this is happening again
frightened oh my god
are you gonna make sure hes alright
okay okay were gonna get out of the car now
mclovin you stay right there
that guy better not be dead
the cops get out of the car and walk over to a now sitting up seth
hes dazed but okay
you pushed me first
i didnt push you into fucking oncoming traffic
the boys notice the cops
is everyone alright
sarcastic were great
well you should be careful boys
thats how accidents happen
what when cops drive like maniacs and hop the fucking curb
evan looks like hes about to shit himself
the cops notice one of the detergent jugs in the middle of a puddle of beer
slater dips his finger in rubs it against his gums like it was cocaine
you boys been doing a bit of drinking
not at all
pointing to the other jug is that more beer you got over there
umm no sir detergent
my clothes are dirty
the cops look at each other then at the boys
you boys stay right here
fogell anxiously sits in the cop car
he cant see whats going on through the shattered windshield
the cops turn away and start to whisper to one another
seth and evan look on nervous
the car is completely fucked and youre the one who fucked it up so youve got to fix it
what do i do
we arrest these little crap stains and dump it on them ill take care of that
you go make sure mclovin is good to play ball
this is it michaels
you wanna hang with the big boys you gotta get your hands dirty
yeah im cool
the cops nod to each other
michaels goes back to the car and gets in
slater walks back over to the boys
he puts his hand on his gun and pulls out his club scaring the shit out of evan and seth
get on the ground
spread your shit
evan and seth lie down on their stomachs and spread their arms and legs out terrified
please dont shoot
mocking puh puh please shut the fuck up
officer michaels is sitting in the drivers seat
was the guy alright
oh yeah the guy was fine
michaels looks back at the homeless guy who looks a little bit more awake than before
are you awake sir
the guy starts to open his eyes a little
michaels grabs the guys face and slams it back knocking him out again
fogell jumps a little
im sorry mclovin
but i really need this to be a private thing
officer michaels takes out two cigarettes and gives one to fogell who accepts quivering in fear
michaels lights his then passes the lighter to fogell
listen mclovin you
officer slater and myself dont you
fogell tries to light his cigarette
it takes a few tries and he starts hacking after the first pull
coughing umm yeah sure
you guys are great
yeah well were also on probation
you see weve actually trashed two other cars
the first time wasnt our fault and the second time a bee flew in and i freaked out
point is we trash another car without a good reason were fucked
know what im saying
fogell continues to painfully suck back on the cigarette
now were going to arrest these guys and if you dont mind which you shouldnt wed like you to write a fake witness report saying they jumped out in front
of our car
fogell nods his head getting some of his cigarette smoke in his eyes
he winces and starts to blink in discomfort
slater stands above the boys
how tall are you
i dont know five foot ten eleven
and you said those were pumas
officer michaels and fogell get out of the car
seth and evan see fogell and stare in shock as he takes a drag of a cigarette and then flicks it aside
michaels pulls slater aside and mumbles into his ear
fogell turns and sees seth and evan hes completely dumbfounded
evan starts to look really nervous like he might literally explode
he starts to stand up
the cops are still talking when suddenly evan bolts
the cops run after evan
seth and fogell look at each other
seth grabs the remaining detergent jug and runs off in the opposite direction of evan
fogell reaches into the cop car grabs the bags of booze and follows seth
officer slater looks back to see seth and fogell running
the cops run back into their car
they cant see out of the shattered windshield
the cops get out of the car and run off after seth and fogell
as they run we see the homeless guy slump out of the car landing on his face with a muffled groan
he stands up grabs the jug of detergent that was left on the ground and runs off
fogell and an exhausted seth are running together
seth grabs fogell and takes him around a house and towards a backyard
a second later the cops run by the house and continue up the block
seth and fogell sprint across a big dark backyard
seth looks back to see if they are being followed
he runs smack into a little red tent and trips onto it
kids inside the tent start screaming as flashlights turn on
hysterical help its a monster
fogell helps seth get up
they try to run but seth is caught on the tent
he drags it a couple feet as the kids start clawing to get out
the zipper opens and a kid hops out
the kid looks at seth
a little girl runs out and books it into the house
from inside the tent another kid starts kicking at seth
seth manages to free himself from the tent and he and fogell fall to the ground
the kids continue to scream
get away from my children
the guys turn and see a crazed slightly overweight father in his underwear running at them with a baseball bat
fogell and seth scramble to their feet as the dad takes a swing at them narrowly missing them
you sick sons of bitches
fogell throws his shoulder into the guy knocking him down
seth and fogell run to the backyard gate and try to open it
fogell starts banging as seth looks back to see the dad coming for them
seth swings the detergent jug at the father knocking him on his ass
he quickly gets up and charges enraged
fogell gets the door open and the two boys run into the alley
they sprint down the alley
seth coughs and wheezes slowing down as he lugs the detergent
the father enters the alley and sees the boys running
he throws his baseball bat
it sails through the air and nails seth in the back
he gets up and the keeps running
slater and michaels completely out of breath desperately scan the area for the boys
stupid little bastards
maybe i should fire a shot
scare em out
evan is nestled inside a large bush frantically trying to reverse his clothes so as to disguise himself
he keeps looking out for the cops when suddenly he hears a gunshot to himself mumbling oh god
as he fumbles to turn his jacket inside out and get it on he sees seth and fogell running towards him
he pops out of the bush scaring fogell and seth
should i run
they all run off down the street
they turn a corner at the end of the block and continue running
they turn onto a main street and are exuberant at the sight of an oncoming bus
it stops at a nearby stop
they haul ass and make it on
out of breath the boys dig up change and put it in the toll box then walk towards the back of the bus
fogell looks up and sees the homeless guy stumbling towards them sucking back the bottom of the lost detergent bottle
the homeless guy sees they have bags full of booze
you got booze in the bag
can you gimme some
you already drank our detergent beer
that was beer
to fogell well you little shit
aint got no cop people to help you keep your booze
the homeless nutcase reaches for the booze
seth steps in front of him
back off or well kick the shit out of you
we cant do that
just because he doesnt have a home doesnt mean he can be a lunatic
give me the booze
the guy shoves seth aside and dives at fogell
helens bottle of goldschlager gets knocked from the bag
it very slowly falls towards the ground
seth reaches for it but doesnt quite grab it
we loudly hear the bottle as it slams against the bus floor
but doesnt break
it slowly rises back up into the air and begins sailing towards the front of the bus
evan leaps through the air sailing towards the precious goldschlager with his arms extended
in slo mo voice he is inches away from grabbing it when it suddenly smashes into a pole shattering sending little gold flakes everywhere
the homeless guy sees the gold flakes
he starts frantically picking up the flakes as evan stares at the remains shocked
fogell walks over
what the hell is going on
where did you come from
calling from front get the fuck off the bus or im calling the cops
the boys look at each other terrified and get off the bus
seth and evan are looking at one another coldly as the bus pulls away
fogell looks at some nearby street signs
ecstatic holy shit
were like three blocks away
best luck ever
the are walking up the street as evan puts his clothes back on right side out
the guys walk up the front steps of jules house
they stand in front of the door
fuck yeah guys
we made it
together and safe
i cant believe helens bottle broke
im sure itll be fine
sarcastic whats the difference
i thought you didnt need it anyways
i thought you were just going to tell her how you feel you fucking pussy
well good luck getting jules drunk enough to have sex with you
whats wrong with you guys

evan stares fogell down

well he knows somethings up

beat seth me and fogell are rooming together next year
i dont even get what the big deal is to be honest
i didnt tell you because save that shit for later
weve got shit to do
seth just goes into the house with the booze leaving fogell and evan
we never should have had to hide our arrangement
the party is in full swing
there is loud music blaring and nearly a hundred people talking dancing and smoking
everyone hes here
hes got it
everyone turns around and sees the seth holding all the liquor
hes got a shit load of booze
everyone starts cheering
seth sets it out on the kitchen table it is an impressive array of inebriates
the bar is open
ecstatically cheering yeah seth
i cant believe it
seth did that
who the fuck is seth
in the background we see evan and fogell wander into the party as jules approaches seth
this is awesome
thank you so much
sorry it was late
to be honest people were starting to get seriously pissed off
listen ive got to go tell everyone the drinks are here
dont go anywhere
ill be right here
jules walks off
tons of kids pour themselves drinks
seth and about six other kids all have overflowing shots of jaeger
everyone drinks and recoils from the taste
a random guy refills everyones shot glasses
pointing to seth another one but to you man
everyone to this guy
who the fuck are you man
they all drink
lets do another one to me
everyone laughs as seth very pleased with himself starts refilling shot glasses
evan walks out onto the back porch looking for helen
he sees becca
where have you been you almost blew it
shes been waiting for you
shes right over there
shes been yammering about you all night
what did she say
does she think im a good guy
what did she say
it was something like ill fully blow him tonight
evan looks over and sees helen standing on the balcony with a big group of people
he gets really nervous
this is too much
what do i do
i lost the goldschlager i was supposed to bring her
well jordana stole a bottle of tequila from her parents and her and helen have been going at it
i think shell be fine in that department
id just go over there and invite her upstairs pronto
so nervous but
shes totally hammered
if i get with her and im not drunk isnt that like date rape
its not date rape if youre drunk too
evan looks at helen and takes a deep breath
evan enters the bathroom and slams the door shut a bottle of ouzo in one hand and a beer in the other
he looks at himself in the mirror seeming as though hes on the verge of a full on panic attack
panting calm down evan
she likes you
she wants to suck on your penis
thats a good thing
he opens the ouzo and smells it recoiling in disgust
down the hatch
evan takes a mighty swig then gags and spits it out spraying it everywhere
fogell sits bored in front of the tv drinking a beer
he watches a bunch of girls flirt with some boys
everyone is talking and laughing while he sits alone
he walks over to the doorway of a room filled with girls dancing
in the corner dancing is nicola
he stares at her for a moment then goes back and sits in front of the tv
he changes the channel and cops comes on the screen
it shows two cops chasing a crack head tackling him and knee dropping him
fogell ponders as he watches cops
he throws back the rest of his beer and marches into the room nicola is dancing in
he walks up to nicola who is by far the best looking girl in the room and starts dancing with her
she looks a bit thrown at first but after a few beats she seems to like it
they call you nicola right
and they call you fogell
they continue dancing
seth taking shot after shot in the kitchen with everyone else glancing over at jules every now and then as she walks around the party sending more people to drink
evan in the bathroom forcing himself to brutally suck back a disgusting amount of ouzo
he sips from his beer takes a deep breath and then starts again
seth dances jokingly with a few people and tells the story of that evening showing them the detergent jug full of beer and acting out the car hitting him
evan who has drank about half the bottle and is pretty drunk stands up arms reached out and tries to walk in a straight line
he does it fairly well
frustrated he sits back down and takes another disgusting swig of ouzo
jules throws seth a smile when she sees him making everyone laugh as he re fills their cups with very foamy slightly blue tinted beer from the detergent jug
evan cant keep his balance as he tries to touch his nose while standing on one foot
he drinks from the tap thirstily eats some toothpaste fixes his collar and hair and then gathers his courage takes a deep breath and steps out of the bathroom
evan walks out on the balcony
he spots the circle of people helen was standing in only now helen is laying on the ground laughing hysterically
everyone in the circle is looking at her and laughing as well
evan is extremely nervous
helen looks up and spots him
evan takes a deep breath walks up to where shes laying
she extends her arms
help me up
none of these people will help me up
evan notices that she seems a little drunk
he helps her up and she collapses onto him forcing him to hold her up
sorry i was helen laughs hysterically as she latches onto evan
he smells her breath
it reeks of alcohol
evans drunk but helen is completely fucking shit faced
oh my god
you are so fucking hilarious
to the group do you goes know how fucking hilarious evan is
to evan tell them how hilarious you are
the group looks over to evan
listen to him
helen starts laughing hysterically
he is so cute
the group chuckles a little
helen puts her arms around evan
ive been waiting for you for like ever
what took you so long

oh man its a crazy story helen picks up a bottle of tequila and shoves it into evans hand
dont worry we can drink this

heres to you
evan takes a much unwanted drink and gags
me and you should go upstairs now
i really want to
tell you something
confused and drunk uh
you could just tell me right here laughing no
lets go upstairs come on
evan hears everyone giggle as helen pulls him towards the house
helen trips just managing not to fall
nicola and fogell are standing in the corner of the room
nicola is looking at fogells id
thats the funniest thing ive ever seen
yeah i just thought it sounded old
they both laugh and their eyes meet
the party is in full swing and everyone is getting good and drunk
jules walks up to seth who is clearly piss drunk
hey im back
i had to thank the peeps for comin out
really really drunk jules
the hostess with the most est
the woman of the hour
seth takes a swig of a beer
this partys blowin my ass off
i want you to have a drink with me
seth offers her a beer
but seriously thanks for getting all the drinks
it really made the night
its just how i roll jules
no problems no problems
jules laughs and seth sees that his charm is working
i love talking and conversing with you youre so good at it but i cant hear you
could we just go on the
balcony or something
jules eyes seth suspiciously
seth just looks at her smiling drunkenly
i havent conversed in ages
lets do it
jules walks out of the kitchen
he finishes off his beer and then happy as shit drunkenly dances out of the kitchen and after jules
evan practically holds helen up almost dropping her several times as they stumble into jules bedroom
helen puts down the tequila and starts kissing evan but its not nice kissing its sloppy porno kissing with way too much tongue
after a few moments evan pulls away and looks at the remarkably drunk helen
are you okay
i so flirt with you in math
i want to tell you i mean ive wanted to tell you for a long time i know
ive wanted to get with you so hard
helen kisses him
helen yanks him onto the bed and starts sloppily kissing him again
evan doesnt know what to do
she tries to take off evans shirt but is way too inebriated to undo the buttons
evan yanks it off
helen stands up and starts to waver back and forth
she looks like shes about to tip over but she catches herself and sloppily tries to strike a sexy pose like a model
evan watches in dread as she starts to strip pulling her shirt over her head completely failing to look sexual
as evan watches the tragedy unfold he grabs the bottle of tequila and takes a big swig
helen sits on the floor and concentrates on untying her shoes
what the fuck
evan moves over to help her
he cant do it either
can you like slip out
helen tries to squeeze her feet out but she cant
she grabs a pair of scissors off a desk
she snips off the knot and slips her shoe off
take off your pants
drunkenly waving the scissors or ill cut em off
helen laughs as she staggers to her feet and start kissing evan
he starts taking off his pants
nicola leads fogell up the stairs
i cant believe im about to get with fogell
i dont know
youre like the most mysterious guy in the grade
like nobody knows anything about you
well youre about to learn a few things
jules and seth step out onto the front porch
there is no one else out there
the moment the door closes behind them seth turns to jules and puts his hands on her hips
he stares into her eyes and moves in for the kiss
jules instantly pulls back
prefer if we did this at some other time
there is no other time
this is the only time
whats wrong with now
well youre drunk
like really really drunk
so are you
im not drunk at all
i dont even drink
seth is absolutely shocked
it takes his remarkably drunk mind a moment to process this information
you dont drink
but you told me to get the liquor
throwin a party remember
you dont drink
i dont drink
and you dont want to
uh you know
not right now thank you very much
seth looks at jules and realizes that hes screwed up
his eyes start to water
seth starts to cry
are you crying
yeah so what if i am
im a fucking idiot and it was my last chance
so i should be crying
last chance to do what
to make you my girlfriend for the summer okay
youre like the coolest person thats ever talked to me and i thought wed both be drunk but
what would me be drunk have anything to do with it
cause youd never get with me in your right mind
look at me
beat and now look at you
suddenly the front door opens and a random girl walks out
yelling into the house hey ricky
was it a quarter or an eighth you want
a fat eighth
the random girl notices seth and jules
the girl hops down the stairs and walks off as jules stares at the sobbing seth
evan sitting on the bed in only his boxers and helen is just getting her pants off leaving her only in her lingerie
evans eyes widen
she looks at evan and rubs her breasts in a very un sexy way
i wore this for you
here we go
helen crawls onto the bed pushes evan down and starts seriously making out with him drunker and sloppier than ever
evan im so wet
still nervous youre so beautiful
helen shoves her hand down evans boxers
evan jolts terrified
youve got such a smooth cock
ive thought you were a really incredible person for a really long time
evan looks really nervous as helens hand starts moving up and down
youve got to get hard for me
im about to
but first i just want to tell you exactly how i im gonna suck your dick so good
evan is taken aback
you dont have to do that you know we can start this relationship on something more than just that
in a sultry whispery voice i need you to eat my hairy love crack
evan sits up
you dont want to do this
yeah i do i want to fuck you
look you know i really like you helen but this is
its just too intense
and im so drunk i dont even know how to like process youre just being a pussy
did you just call me a
a scared little pussy puke
evan watches in horror as helen vomits all over jules bed
i need becca
ill go get her
are you going to be okay
oh god oh god oh
evan winces as she throws up again
fogell is laying on his back on the bed and nicola is straddling him
they are kissing
nicola sits up and takes fogells hand and starts sucking his fingers
ive got a boner
do you have a condom
he pulls a condom out
he pulls out a little bottle of lube
seth and jules are both seated on the stairs
seth has his face in his hands
jules is patting him on the back but clearly feels awkward
seth looks up at her drunk as hell his eyes half open
you didnt blow it youre a seth blanks out and falls forward
he head butts jules in the face
jules clutches her eye as seth slumps onto the patio floor unconscious
she gets up yelling in pain as seth opens his eyes
what the fuck
jules storms into the house leaving seth lying on the front porch
he wiggles around a bit
seth passes out again
a few moments go by when suddenly a cop car pulls up in front of the house
seth opens his eyes and sees the cops
two cops get out and start harassing two kids smoking a joint on the front lawn
one of them turns on their flashlight and seth sees its officer slater and michaels
evan sitting on the couch next to miroki evans partner from cooking class drinking a bottle of tequila
hes absolutely smashed
lifes bullshit huh miroki
suddenly seth bursts into the room and grabs evans shirt
fuckin wax off asshole
im helping you man
seth grabs evans wrists and tries to pull him to his feet
fuck off jerk
youre hurting my shoulders
just then terry the guy who spat on seth in the beginning walks by
look its christina and britney
have fun boning each other on grad night
terry and his buddies laugh their asses off when suddenly
the loud authoritative knocking echoes through the party and everyone looks to the door knowing it can only mean one thing
someone opens the door revealing officer slater and officer michaels
they talk to whoever answered the door oblivious of evan and seth
we had a complaint about the noise
it looks like youre having a nice little party here
a nice little underage drinking party
evan points at the cops
its the cops
thats what ive been
seth pulls evan up and the two drunkenly make their way out of the living room just as the cops step into it
okay everyone out
get out of here
michaels turns to slater
ill go upstairs
i told you this would release some anger
ill tell you what would release some anger if one of these little fuckers touched me and i got to club his face in
seth and evan run through the back yard
seth stumbles and falls but quickly gets up
with great difficulty the boys drunkenly lift themselves up and over the fence
fogell is on top of nicola in the missionary position
beat its in
fogell wears the greatest look of accomplishment one could possibly imagine
suddenly officer michaels bursts into the room and flicks on the lights
what the hell
nicola screams grabs her clothes and runs into the bathroom
what the fuck
you ran away from us
turns to the door michaels
get up here
i hit my head when we crashed
i was all disoriented and i just wandered off confused
shut the fuck up
wait a minute
how old was that girl
you sick bastard thats statutory rape mclovin
officer slater appears in the doorway
he was violating a sixteen year old girl
fogell covers himself with the blanket and starts to get up
i didnt break the law
im not really even sit your ass down and keep it down
youre going to jail fucko
nicola now dressed emerges from the bathroom
she screams and runs out
they take fogells arms and handcuff him
to fogell they dont take kindly to your type in jail mclovin
drunk joyful and out of breath the boys stop running
you saved me
i totally did
i wanted to
wanna sleep at my house man
youre my best friend
you got pizza bagels still
look what else i gots
evan pulls a half bottle of tequila
they start to drink it together
all the kids from the party have congregated in the front yard
the cop car is parked right in front
we see the officers dragging fogell through the crowd of kids
suddenly a wad of spit hits slater in the shoulder
he turns and sees terry the guy who spat on seth
slater walks over and bashes the kid in the face with his nightstick
the kid drops
there you go
that does feel better
they throw fogell into the back of the cop car
the cops both get in and slam their doors
they just stare forward
am i going to jail
the two cops burst out laughing hysterically
laughing his ass off yeah
youre going to fuckin azkaban
you are the funniest fuckin kid i have ever met
weve been fuckin with you
i love this kid
i dont understand
we know youre not twenty five
what are we morons
what are you
we had you going mclovin
seth and evan sit at the back of the empty bus together
is the bang bus anything like this
seth cracks up laughing
the cop car is spinning donuts in the middle of the empty lot
fogell and officer michaels get out both smiling
the driver side window rolls down reveal slater
what im about to show you is pretty much the greatest move in donut spinning history
behold the reverse figure eight
slater drives to the other side of the lot
so like whats your official position
if you were in you were in
you are no longer a virgin end of story
suddenly slater guns it and speeds across the lot slamming the breaks spinning wildly in several erratic donuts backward donuts
slater completely loses control of the car
he smashes through a bunch of shopping carts and slams into a light post completely fucking up the cruiser
slater tries to open his door but it wont budge
he crawls out the missing windshield slumping onto the ground
i think thats all the fun were gettin out of this one
slater hands fogell his note pad
and by signing this you are officially saying that as we stopped you from being mugged a crack head stole our cruiser and did god knows what with it
that mugger had nothing but murder in his eyes
i owe you my life
fogell signs the pad
can we do this already
the cops and fogell push the cruiser towards a small but steep hill
they shove it over the edge and watch it roll
it gains speed and smashes into a tree shattering the windows and crushing the front of the car
can we shoot at it
i dont know can you
they whip out their guns
im throwin down the gauntlet
whoever hits the gas tank
you are so fucking on
can i get a shot
slater hands fogell his gun
with a huge smile fogell raises the gun aims it at the police cruiser and blasts off round after round
seth and evan are lying in sleeping bags beside one another
the now empty bottle of tequila lies between them
they are laughing very hard still drunk off their asses
i cant believe she said that shit
oh my lord
you have no idea
they laugh harder
and then you saved me man
i fucking love you
i fucking love you too man
im not embarrassed i just love you
why dont we say that more
it feels good
i love you more than my brother man
like when you went away for easter last year i like missed you
i missed you too

seth grabs evan and they hug
well always be friends
cause we love each other
they stop hugging and sit back down
theyre laughter slows down and there is a moment of silence
like three weeks ago i was in you room and like you were taking a dump and
i saw your residence placement thingy
i totally saw youre living with fogell
so like im sorry man
i was being a bitch
i need you to know that its not like i even want to live with fogell its just that im really afraid of living with strangers
there is a moment of silence
i was pissed off i didnt get with jules but like
we really got through a lot of our shit you know
yeah me too
at least we kind of came together again
good night seth
i love you

evan wakes up and looks over at seth who is also waking
they look at each other extremely awkwardly almost as though they drunkenly had sex with each other last night
they stare at each other uncomfortable
you sleep good

seth looks at his watch
maybe i should get going

evan is standing in the pants section of a department store
seth walks out of the dressing room wearing jeans that are way too small
dont ask me
i dont give a shit if your pants look good
well i need someones opinion
theyre way too small
yeah but when i was wearing your dads pants last night i realized that if i buy pants that are too small itll encourage me to lose weight
and in tight pants chicksll kind of see my dick a little
yeah the male camel toe look is really big this year
seth goes back into the dressing room and wriggles out of the pants
he walks out
these pants suck
lets the get the fuck out of here
they walk through the department store when suddenly evan sees helen and jules looking at comforters
angle on helen and jules

angle on seth and evan holy shit
helen looks like hell and jules has a horrible black eye

she waves and points them out to jules
seth and evan wave back
the girls get up and start to walk over

i have to go to macys to get a shitload of cover up for the grad photo
mortified oh man
yeah and im going to linen brothers to buy jules a new comforter
i have to get a comforter too for college
flirtatiously joking so you gonna come with me to macys and buy me my cover up or what
id love to
i had such bad acne last year i became an expert on the stuff
you could get your college pants there
yeah but wait
you drove me here evan drove me here how do we ive got my dads car
ill take you home and evan can give helen a lift
that sounds good
maybe we can go eat after
seth and evan look at each other odd smiles on both their faces
they didnt blow it
so uh ill call you later
yeah man have a good one
come on seth
jules pulls seth away
evan and helen start walking in the opposite direction
as they walk away from one another seth and evan look back and give each other a small and yet emotionally charged wave
a slow gut wrenching soul song starts to play
they look as though theyre never going to see each other again
as jules and seth walk into macys and helen and evan descend an escalator the music swells to a mind fuckingly awesome crescendo and we humbly fade to black
we flip through seths seemingly endless penis drawings from childhood
they are hilarious
