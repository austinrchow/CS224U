september we hear the sound of a plane landing over black
the back of a girl in pink underwear she leans at a big window looking out over tokyo
melodramatic music swells over the girls butt in pink sheer underwear as she lies on the bed
pov from a car window the colors and lights of tokyo neon at night blur by
in the backseat of a presidential limousine bob late forties tired and depressed leans against a little doily staring out the window
from car window we see buildings covered in bright signs a billboard of brad pitt selling jeans another of bob in black white looking distinguished with a bottle of whiskey
in a suntory ad
more signs a huge tv with perky japanese pop stars singing
bobs black presidential looks like a s diplomats car pulls up at the entrance of the park hyatt a modern sky rise
the automatic doors open on the car as bob gets out
eager bellhops with white gloves approach at the sight of the car welcoming bob and helping him with his bags
bob stands in the back of a crowded elevator surrounded by japanese businessmen below his shoulders
the elevator stops at the th floor and the doors open onto the massive streamline lobby of the park hyatt
bob follows the japanese businessmen out into the marble and glass lobby that frames the view of tokyo
the concierge and several eager hotel managers greet bob
he just wants to sleep but more staff continue to greet him ask him about his fright
they lead him to reception
at the reception area four japanese businessmen and two women quickly sit up from their seats on sight of bob and extend handshakes and gifts
they bow and introduce themselves from the commercial company extend name cards and welcome him enthusiastically
more staff welcomes him and offer their service during his stay
one of them presents a fax that has come for him
he doesnt know what to do with it and stuffs it in his pocket
the commercial people tell him when theyll be picking him up and ask if he needs anything else
some japanese rock stars with shag haircuts and skinny leather pants pass by
each commercial person has to shake bobs hand before leaving
bob sits on the end of the bed in a too small hotel kimono
bob sits at the bar
a few minutes pass as he sits in silence looking around drinking a scotch
chet baker sings the thrill is gone over the stereo
we see bobs pov of tables of people talking
japanese women smoking american businessmen tying one on talking about software sales
a waiter carefully setting down a coaster and pouring a beer very very slowly
its all very foreign
the automatic hotel curtains open pouring light into the room
bob gets in the shower overlooking the view of tokyo
the shower head is at his elbows he raises it as high as it goes and leans down to have a shower
this hotel was not designed with him in mind
whiskey commercial shoot
the set is full of activity as the japanese crew work
bob in a shawl collared tuxedo sits at a european style bar set with a cut crystal glass of whiskey
a japanese girl quickly powders his face as they adjust lights and the director and crew speak in hurried japanese
the director with blue contact lenses says a few long sentences in japanese
translator a middle aged woman in a coordinated outfit translates but it is only a short sentence now
he wants you to turn look in camera and say the lines
bob wonders what shes leaving out or if thats the way it works from japanese to english
thats all he said
yes turn to camera
bob thinks lets just get it over with
turn left or right
the translator blots her face with a tissue and asks the director in a japanese sentence times as long
the director answers her in a long excited phrase
and with intensity
is that everything
it seemed like he was saying a lot more
the excited director says more in japanese
translator nods in understanding
bob doesnt really know whats going on
like an old friend and into the camera
to bob suntory time
they get ready and roll camera bob turns and looks suavely to the camera for relaxing times make it suntory time
the director yells something about ten sentences long
the translator nods
could you do it slower and with more intensity
the translator answers for him in four sentences
on the monitor we see the next take the moody lighting shines on bob the camera gets closer as he stares into camera and gives them the line
for relaxing times make it suntory time
shinjuku high rises sparkle
tall glass walls show the neon and high rises of the city
a sad and romantic bill evans song plays
bob sits alone with a scotch at the bar
some drunk american businessmen with their ties thrown over their shoulders recognize him
hey youre bob harris youre awesome man
yeah i love sunset odds
bob oh ok thanks
man that car chase bob nods
bob comes back to his room
the maids have left everything perfect his beige bed is turned down and the tv has been left on to a channel playing a montage of flower close ups in
nature while sad violin music plays
its supposed to be relaxing but its just sad
bob lies in bed
he flips through tv channels from the remote control
he passes a japanese game show to an s cannon ball run type movie with him in it dubbed into japanese
he turns it off as he hears a knock at the door
he goes to the door and opens it part way
raspy japanese voice mr
kazuzo sent me
can i enter
he pauses then opens the door
a woman in her forties in a short tight leather mini skirt and stockings comes in
she is wearing s style make up
bob sits on the bed not sure what to do as he watches her
bobs pov we see her back to us as she puts a cd on the stereo it begins to play serge gainsberg and brigitte bardot sing bonnie clyde
the woman turns slyly around and shimmies over to bob
as she tries to undress him mr
do you like massage
i dont think so
kazuzo send premium fantasy
she pushes him back onto the bed
he hesitates but then goes along with it passively
he fumbles with her stockings trying to do as she says
no lip them
dont touch me
he takes his hands back confused
lip my stockings
he backs away as he tries to understand her
she throws her leg up to him on the bed
she pantomimes ripping them
he finally understands
oh you want me to rip them
he pulls at her stockings trying to rip them but they just snap
she pretends to struggle
please let me go
he pulls his hands away
she grabs them and puts them back on her and keeps struggling dramatically
they wrestle around awkwardly her pretending to try to get away but not letting him go
she rips her stockings and falls off the bed in fake defense
let me go
she pulls a confused bob down on top of her
he doesnt know what she wants
she rips another stocking and pins him on the ground
he tries to crawl away she grabs his leg and trips him
he grabs a nearby table leg as he falls the lamp crashes to the floor the room goes black
i think you should leave
in the harsh sunlight of the big windows bob eats breakfast alone
next to him is a table of texans in cowboy hats
at another table a japanese couple in sunglasses chain smoke and drink coffee
bob gets into the ded elevator
he is stopped momentarily by the concierge who asks him if everything is fine for his stay
in the elevator bobs surrounded by japanese businesspeople and a family dressed for a wedding
across at the other side of the elevator he sees charlotte a pretty ivy league girl in her mid twenties and the only other westerner in the elevator
her honey colored hair stands out in the crowd
shes looking at him like you do when someone new comes in the elevator but the japanese look straight ahead at the elevator doors
charlotte and bob look at each other across the japanese heads
she smiles from one foreigner to another
the door opens and she gets out with the crowd
bob watches her leave
harris he is approached by a group of eight excited people from the commercial company there waiting to take him
as they are on their way we just got a request from tanabe mori he is the johnny carson of japan
it is a big honor to be invited to his show
bob feigns enthusiasm briefly
can you stay until friday
ill have to see about that
bobs back is to us as a make up artist is putting some final touches on him
the photographer is giving her enthusiastic direction in japanese
bob talks on his cell phone not paying attention to the make up artist

he hangs up
the make up artist dusts him with powder
the commercial people are crowding around
bobs chair is swivelled around and we see him in his tuxedo wearing too much make up and some weird looking eyeliner
in front of a grey backdrop moody lighting is being adjusted and bob is handed a bottle of suntory
small documentary crew moves in on bob with a video camera the camera man is tilting the camera at his face in arty dutch camera moves
the agency people crowd around
the photographer is excited and urges bob to do dumb poses he wont do
can you put hands close to face
the photographer demonstrates a dramatic pose with his hands at his face
urn i dont think so
how bout i just hold the bottle
the photographer starts shooting
bob obviously hates the whole thing what you do for money
bob still in his tuxedo and make up from the shoot sits alone having a drink
a jazz band from sausalito performs
the singer is a middle aged woman with red wavy hair dressed in red and takes her singing very seriously
she sings a slow version of parsley sage rosemary and thyme
a golden beer is poured very slowly
bob drinks his scotch hoping it will all go away
across the bar charlotte sits with john her husband he is in his late twenties and sloppy in a fashionable way and some friends super stylish weird japanese fashion people
one of them charlie in a shiny suit keeps taking pictures and showing them magazine layouts
were glad to be here were sausalito
charlotte laughs and looks down the japanese audience clap very seriously
she and bob catch eyes about sausalito and how weird it is there
the mirrored elevator doors close and bob sees himself close up in the elevators mirrored walls noticing the heavy makeup and weird eyeliner from the shoot which he had forgotten
he looks at himself
charlotte lays close to her young husband john
she looks to see if hes awake but hes sleeping soundly
she leans her chin on his shoulder
are you awake
he doesnt answer
he grumbles something opens one sleepy eye to look at her and grabs her under the covers
he kisses her
go to sleep
he holds her close but she cant sleep
charlotte sits on a ledge looking out at the big buildings
the sun is starting to come up
below she watches cars going places
bob lies in bed awake
the clock says
the in room fax machine is making noise as a fax rolls in
bob looks at the fax machine but doesnt get out of bed
the fax curls and falls to the floor
three pages of shelf diagrams follow
the gym is empty except for an old man vacuuming
bob passes piles of little towels and bottles of water
he takes a water for his workout
he approaches an exercise machine and puts the water in the drink holder of the machine
he looks at the lit up instruction panel it is all in japanese
he pushes a button and the machine starts beeping then a soothing womans voice recites instructions in japanese
he gets on it and sinks
he tries to make the arms and foot peddles coordinate
he pushes a button and it starts moving too fast
in an upward rotation he tries to reach the control panel but is not fast enough
the soothing womans voice continues instruction
she occasionally includes an english word gently gently
vigorous he tries to keep up with it and tries again to push the right button to slow it down but the machine steps starts going swiftly backwards instead
the agency group wait for bob
they stand up as he approaches from the elevator trying to mask a slight limp
everythings fine good morning
miss kawasaki notices his limp with concern as they leave the hotel
charlotte gets out at shibuya station a crowded neighborhood filled with neon ads and people
she looks up at the huge intersection as tons of japanese people wait to cross the street no one steps forward until the cross walk light changes and all of
a tv screen covering a building plays commercials
she roams around the narrow streets crowded with stylish japanese kids tan schoolgirls pass her
charlotte wanders down a crowded street looking around
on a small side street she stops at a little park
she watches a japanese man and woman together c
the man reaches his hand to the back of the womans neck and leans in close
the woman smiles at him in love
john is sound asleep
charlotte is awake next to him
she looks at the clock its three a
she slides close to him kisses his mouth
he grumbles something in his deep sleep and rolls over
she goes to the couch stepping over camera equipment
she looks at the fruit basket decides to try an apple
she has a piece but isnt really hungry
she reaches over some proof sheets and looks at a magazine but shes already looked at it a few times before
she decides to go downstairs
bob sits alone at the bar
charlotte sits down a seat away from him lost in his thoughts he doesnt see her until he turns and finds her next to him
they look at each other
a young bartender with a sweet face tends to them

the hotel is filled with business people

charlotte walks into the empty hotel room
charlottes feet as she clips her toenails
charlottes hand by an ashtray writes in a journal
charlotte looks in a mirror trying on an unfinished scarf shes knitting
she checks the length on herself
charlotte sits on the big window sill checking her messages on the phone
voice mail recording hi leave a message

charlotte pushes a button
charlotte hangs up charlotte lies on the bed in the knit scarf and underwear shes doing a quiz in a magazine an olympic pool is framed by tall glass walls
with the tokyo view
bob is handed a swim cap and goggles
bob watches a japanese businessman swimming he looks like an over grown baby
bob swims laps in the pristine pool
he continues his laps
under water he sees the jumping legs of middle aged women
a disco mixed tape starts and above water we see a western instructor in tight shorts leading an aqua aerobics class to the group of women they jump up and
down to sister sledge
bob walks past the rows of lockers to the sauna room
he sits in the sauna two hotel guests speak german in the corner
bob comes out from the sauna red and sweaty
bob submerges in the cold water of a small pool in the sauna room having a moment of relief
charlotte lies on the floor with big headphones on listening to a book on tape
after a corny music intro a very serious scholar mans voice speaks clearly dr
did you ever wonder what your purpose in life is
this book is about finding your souls purpose or destiny
every soul has its path but sometimes that path is not clear
the acorn theory is an example of each soul beginning with an imprint
charlotte tries to get into it but cant get past feeling like a loser listening to a self help tape
she looks at the doctors photo on the audio book box hes bald in a turtleneck and glasses
charlotte follows a japanese family in formal dress out of the elevator onto the mezzanine level
she wanders down a big hall
she sees an open door and steps in the crowded room which is in the midst of a press conference
cameras flash as kelly with wide eyes behind a table answers questions enthusiastically
kelly you know barbecuing and yoga and i love taking my dogs buster and lulu for walks on the beach
and it was great learning karate for midnight racer i did all my own stunts
the japanese journalists seem excited by her answer
kelly throws a karate punch for a photographer
what was it like working with keanu reeves
it was great
ive known him for a while now you know we both live in l
we both have dogs
charlotte walks out
charlotte continues down a hall she stops at an open door and peeks in
a quiet group of japanese women are gathered around a table
charlotte goes in as she gets closer she sees they are being instructed in ikebana floral design
each woman has a little vase and elegant flower cuttings
she watches as they delicately arrange the tiny flowers
the instructor hands charlotte a vase and cuttings
alongside the women charlotte tries to follow along
charlotte reclines low in the bathtub staring off
she can see mount fuji in the distance
the audio tape plays on the stereo
dry monotonous platos text calls this image the paradeigma
so the lot is the image that is your inheritance your place on earth all compacted into a pattern that has been selected by your soul before you even got
here or better said that is always and continually being selected by your soul because time does not enter the equation of myth
with her back to us charlotte looks out the big window
john comes up and kisses her
howd it go today
he hugs her for a moment leaning on her
i gotta go meet kelly for a drink downstairs
she wants to talk about some photo thing
maybe ill walk down with you

at a corner table charlotte sits with john kelly and dj clean a skinny kid in a sweatshirt on tour in japan
charlotte is bored while kelly talks on
sausalito performs in the background
my dad was anorexic
shes never heard of that really
john shoots charlotte a look
very serious he was on the american side at the bay of pigs in cuba and he was taken prisoner and they tortured them about their food the whole time
my dad fought on the american side at the bay of pigs
so when he was a prisoner they would tell them they had put poison in their food and they would make themselves throw up
and when he got back he did better but he still has food issues
he has to have really clean food
and really simple
he cant just go have say chinese food
trying oh thats too bad
charlotte ashes her cigarette in a clean ashtray and she watches as it is quickly replaced with a new one by a waiter
nodding at the view how crazy is this shit
yeah it is
dj clean starts doing a human beat box at her
charlotte looks over at kelly
oh my god you have to try it this power cleanse is amazing its lemon juice and grade b maple syrup and cayenne pepper for seven days
just like a half a teaspoon of cayenne
the first few days youre a little scattered but by day four its amazing
my eyes were so white
charlotte excuses herself
she passes bob who sits at his usual spot at the bar as she is leaving
hi again hows it going

charlotte laughs with sympathy but doesnt know what to tell him
john sleeps soundly turned away from her charlotte cant sleep
she turns on the t
to a crazy local t
bob cant sleep he watches the same show on t v
he flips the channel its an old black white japanese movie of a man committing hari kari
charlotte finds her way down a narrow street in an old section of tokyo
she turns a corner and finds a square with what she was looking for
the sun shines over a beautiful old temple
birds chirp charlotte approaches and goes inside
charlotte stands in the back and watches a ceremony
a roshi speaks in japanese monks chant
its all very foreign
charlotte tries to feel something
charlotte sits on the bed talking to john whos coming out of the bathroom getting ready to go to work
he checks himself in the mirror charlotte am i shallow
no what are you talking about

he looks for his mobile phone

she hangs up
she sits there for a moment starting to cry she wipes the tears trying to make them go away
tokyo goes by out the window
charlotte looks at the people on the crowded train
a sweaty businessman blots his face with a little handkerchief
another older businessman reads an erotic comic book
charlotte looks up at the many signs trying to figure out which way to go but they are all in japanese characters
confused she chooses the west exit
charlotte walks down a little street in a quiet neighborhood
she stops at a window of a portrait studio and looks at all of the wedding portraits
they are very formal and retouched japanese brides and grooms dressed in a western old fashion style
charlotte looks through the window as a tan japanese boy tries to win a stuffed animal for his girlfriend
in a crowded arcade charlotte watches some kids play dance revolution a video game where you dance along to cues on the light up floor
one businessman in a suit is really good and into it
she sees a sushi chef game where you have to cut an electronic fish
she looks at a firefighter game and rows of plexi boxes filled with some little character dolls you try to win
charlotte looks at the shelves of books she passes she flips through some books
she walks over to a small gallery space and goes up to the wall to see the small photos
they are of tied up partially naked japanese school girls one girl is spanking another one with a stuffed animal
shes making a face of ecstacy
charlotte looks at it not getting it
charlotte stands alone on a side street smoking a cigarette and watching the crowds go by
charlotte walks up a little street filled with shops
she stops at a window of cute underwear that she
she goes into the shop
she puts watermelon color lipstick on
she looks at herself in the mirror in her new underwear
we hear the shower running in the bathroom
charlotte decorates the room putting up some paper cherry blossom decorations
she goes over to the bed and stubs her toe on it as she flops down
she holds her toe annoyed with her klutziness
john talks to her from the shower
at the fitting they had all these rock n roll clothes the label guys kept saying lock n loll though but the band doesnt look tough at all
they look better just skinny and nerdy like how when they came in
they looked so uncomfortable in these keith richards clothes they should just be like they are dont you think
shes drifted off

he gets out and is rushing to get his stuff together to go
charlottes lounging on the bed in her new pink underwear

he passes an ashtray with cigarette butts in it
will you please stop smoking
but i like to

he picks up a camera from a table in the corner
he looks at the self help audio book box
a souls search finding your true character and calling

thats nothing someone gave it to me
you dont have to be embarrassed
its just corny but im not into it

he kisses the side of her face and her shoulder like a cute pet and then continues getting his stuff together
john sets two bottles of cristal on the bed next to her not really seeing her
oh the record company sent these

charlotte sits there alone with the unopened bottles of champagne
water splashes as charlotte dives into the pool in a one piece bathing suit as the sun goes down
leaving in her robe charlotte runs into bob in his robe going to the pool
awkward but glad to run into her hi

as bob opens his door to his room a fedex package falls in his path
he opens it large carpet swatches fall out with a note he looks at them for a second they all look the same and why is she sending these
he puts them down
the elaborate chiming doorbell rings
charlotte opens the door to see bob
hes wearing an orange camouflage t shirt
she looks at his shirt suppressing a smile

bob walks up and is amused watching her she sees him and gets embarrassed
hiromix dances charlotte dances with hans she looks sweaty but beautiful
bob dances with his eyes closed really into it in the midst of all of them
the song i feel too young plays
bob and charlotte are leaving nobus
shes wearing bobs jacket

bob takes charlottes arm carefully just as she bangs her head walking into the glass door it makes a loud thud

bob looks back at charlie who is watching shes fine
he leads her into a waiting cab
pov from cab tokyo neon blurs by
it looks beautiful
charlotte looks at the neon going by
she looks over at bob her eyelids are too heavy for her
i dont want to go home

bob carries a very drunk charlotte to her room
her purse dangling from his arm
he puts her on her bed
he takes her shoes off for her and pulls a blanket over her
he looks at her lying on the bed
she opens her eyes to smile at him
he wants to kiss her but he leaves
he walks down the empty hall not wanting to leave her
as he goes he looks at various trays of leftover room service in the hallway
bob comes back to his room tripping over the carpet samples
he makes a phone call from bed
hes still a little drunk and thinking about his night out in tokyo
lydia i went to this great house tonight this guy designed and built you would have loved it
i wish i had seen it

her hand wraps the phone cord around her fingers
yeah im going to take a shower and ill meet you downstairs
ok see you downstairs
they sit in the bright light
she squints and drinks a bloody mary
bob is distant
she looks across at two middle aged mid western women talking about plastic surgery you cant hear them but can tell as they gesture and one pulls her eye lids
charlotte looks at another table by the elaborate buffet and sees the redhead singer having breakfast with the rest of sausalito
trying to make it light hey look its sausalito
i see them every morning
they dont know what to say
somehow its too intimate having breakfast
she eats her breakfast aware of her every movement
her pov of soft scrambled eggs
in the distance bob swings on a perfect golf course
charlotte lies in bed awake
the clock says its a
finally she gives up on trying to sleep and turns the light on
in johns old t shirt and ugg boots she goes to the couch looks at some strange pastry with an elaborate presentation left by the hotel
she picks up a magazine but shes already looked at it a few times before
she hears something and goes over to the door
on her way she passes her red t
anthony suitcase overflowing with stuff that looks like a bomb went off in it
a hotel message envelope is slipped under the door
she opens it to see a typed note from the operator from mr
message are you awake
she smiles like shes gotten a valentine
bob opens the door charlottes standing there trying to look casual shes happy to see him shes put some pants on and flip flops instead of her dumb looking ugg
she knocks into a low table bumping her knee as she comes in
bob pours some cold sake smoothly
bob and charlotte watch la dolce vita with japanese subtitles on the tv
hans was very attentive to you
i think he kind of liked me
is that so hard to imagine
no its easy
howd a japanese guy get a name like hans
i dont know
anita ekberg holds the kitten on t
charlotte gets up to pour more sake
she picks up and looks at a prescription bottle on his night stand and reads the label lipitor
do you remember when we met at the bar
you were wearing a tuxedo
but the first time i saw you was in the elevator
yeah you dont remember
did i scowl at you
no you smiled
i dont remember
i know i kind of blend in here
pan the view of tokyo at night as we hear their conversation why do they switch the rs and ls here
i dont know

lets never come here again because it would never be as much fun
ok whatever you want
did you see hiromix last night dancing with bambi
no i was looking at you
they were dancing on the couch with that weird english guy who kept talking about hanging out with the sex pistols on kings road
i got a fax today from your friend hiromix
oh for her show
no for a candlelight dinner yes for her show
charlotte and bob lie a few feet apart on the bed
does it get easier
no yes it does
but look at you
it does the more you know who you are
you dont care about things the same way
i just dont know what im supposed to be
i thought maybe i wanted to be a writer
but i hate what i write and i tried taking pictures but johns so good at that and mine are so mediocre
and every girl goes through a photography phase like horses you know dumb pictures of your feet
youll figure it out
im not worried about you
but im mean
and marriage does that get easier
we started going to a marriage counselor
did that help
did you learn anything
we established that we have no communication
we used to have fun she used to like to go to places with me for my movies and we would laugh at all the weirdos but now shes tired
of it all
she never wants to leave the kids she doesnt need me and they dont need me i feel like im in the way
it gets complicated when you have kids
that changes everything
thats too scary
when theyre born its like vietnam
getting tired no one ever tells you that
but its great being with them after they can talk and can do things with you
my parents were always traveling they werent around so much
whered you grow up
my dad was the ambassador to france in the eighties so we went to school in paris for a few years
but we mostly lived in d
and they were never around
and then i moved to los angeles when john and i got married
its so different there
they are starting to get tired
john thinks im so snotty
i know but thats what you like about me
she looks over at him
he does like her
why do you have to be with your opposite why cant similar people be together
because that would be too easy
they fall asleep dressed on top of the sheets on opposite sides of the bed
full of life bob plays basketball with some local guys
all over the court and towering over the other players bob dominates the game
bob looks at himself in the bathroom mirror he feels his stubble and sees that its turning grey
he opens the hotel shaving kit
he squirts shaving cream from the child size can
even the razor is small
he covers his face with shaving cream when the phone rings
harris we have fax for you
do you want i send it to your room
thank you mr
he hangs up and shaves
bob gets out of the elevator the suntory group is waiting for him
he ducks behind a wall and sneaks out a side entrance of the hotel
bob comes out of the hotel into the sunlight
the street is crowded with motorcycle gangs going by one waves a big flag
bob watches the strange scene in the street for a moment and then makes his way past
he walks down a little street in a more old fashioned neighborhood
hes wearing new techno sneakers
he makes a call on his cell phone
its bob harris
im not going to be able to do that interview today
yes id love to stay to be on his talk show
a light rain starts as he looks at a fax from charlotte with a map shes drawn and tries to figure out where he is there are no street signs
bob finally finds the small restaurant
the automatic door opens for him and charlotte at the bar with the cute chubby sushi chef turns to bob happy to see him
he is disheveled from the rain and adorable
he sits down next to charlotte she pours him a beer and orders for him
you made it
they really have to work on that street name thing
a perky recording voice says kornichiwa
from his pocket
he pulls a pink hello kitty watch from his pocket
its for my daughter
how old is she
oh shell love it
the sushi chef gives him perfect little pieces of sushi on a banana leaf
charlotte takes a bite of a piece but it wont break so she has to stuff the whole thing in her mouth embarrassed
bob makes fun of her gracelessness
mouth full fuck off
they have lunch he makes her laugh
he looks down at her feet in flip flops her toe is purple
what happened to your toe
i dont know i think maybe i broke it
i knocked into something the other day
she slips her shoe off and shows it to him her middle toe is black and blue
that doesnt look good
she enjoys the sympathy
its bad isnt it
we should get you to the doctor
you think so
yeah look at that thing
she smiles at him
bob tries to get a taxi finally one stops and they get in
he tries to explain hospital he does pantomime draws a first aid cross but the driver doesnt understand
charlotte is enjoying bobs effort
finally he finds a park hyatt matchbook and calls the hotel number
how do you say hospital in japanese
one moment please
she transfers call it rings
concierge desk may i help you
yes can you tell me how to say hospital in japanese
hospital in japanese
he tells the driver who looks at him funny
bob says it again faster with a japanese accent
the driver nods excitedly and drives off
bob and charlotte walk in looking around at where to go
bob talks to a woman at the desk to explain what they need
bob takes a seat in waiting area as charlotte goes into a little room with a number on it
bob waits next to a year old lady
charlotte stands alone barefoot on a little box wearing a lead apron as a man and assistant x ray different angles of her foot
bob looks around at all the japanese gift stuff and buys a little stuffed bunny
his phone rings as hes paying for it
bob its me
oh hi elaine
so we got you on an earlier flight but i really think you should think about staying for that talk show
youll do it
yeah ill stay
charlottes foot x rays are displayed on a big light box
an older doctor talks about them in japanese to his younger assistant as he wraps charlottes toes together
she doesnt know what theyre talking about
charlotte comes out where bob waits with the little stuffed bunny
is that for me
bob and charlotte arrive back at the massive hotel they stroll in casually she is carrying the stuffed rabbit in her arm
bob reclines in the big japanese wooden tub steam rises as he is turning red
his phone rings
he dries his hands quickly to reach it before it stops ringing
is this a bad time
its really hard to reach you
did you get the carpet samples
i like the burgundy
ok whatever you think
its just carpet

bob rides in the back of a cab
voice mail message hi bob its charlotte
how are you doing today
im going to meet charlie and those guys at this place called orange around ten
come meet us if you get this
bobs cab pulls up at an empty office building
bob looks at a fax from charlotte with a map wondering if hes in the right place
its quiet and looks like a generic office building
he goes in the little metal elevator and the door opens on the th floor onto a little nightclub you would have never thought was there
lights strobe and peaches seedy fuck the pain away booms through the speakers
tan japanese strippers with platinum hair dance and hang from a pole on a little platform
bob sits alone on a brown ultra suede couch feeling out of place and empty
he looks over at a table of young american investment brokers
he wishes he wasnt there but tries to seem comfortable
charlotte shows up with charlie and the other guys
she sits down next to him and gives him an are you going to kill me
how long have you been here
he looks at her like its been forever
she smiles for forgiveness
they look over and see a weird guy in the corner getting a lap dance they look at each other sharing the joke of the place but both uncomfortable about
the sexuality of it
through a beaded curtain charlie and bambi get lap dances in a dark corner of pillows
charlotte looks at bob
cmon lets go
bob and charlotte go up to a cab but the driver refuses them
they dont know why but just make their way down an empty side street
little plastic cherry blossom decorations hang above them
wheres your husband
like shes said it a million times working
do you ever see him
do you know where we are
she puts a coin in a vending machine and takes a cold sake one cup
a tiny brad pitt head smiles at her next to an iced coffee
isnt it weird there are no street names in tokyo
youd think a city like this would have street names
you need a map to get anywhere
look there are no signs
they keep walking small figures on a little empty street
as they make their way back they pass a lounge off the lobby
its late its pretty empty a housekeeper vacuums and just a sleeping man sits in the back of the lounge and a snuggled up romantic japanese couple sit close to
kelly the blonde actress singing to them
she stands facing them with a karaoke mic singing nobody does it better with all her heart
bob and charlotte look at each other and keep walking trying to be invisible
charlotte lies in bed
she picks up a photo next to the bed as she dials the phone
the picture is of her and john on their honeymoon
the phone answers its a weird japanese recording
hi john if this is your phone
im not sure
im going to go to kyoto for the day
i try you when i get back
hope its going good
i love you bye
charlotte watches the japanese countryside go by out her window
charlotte walks through a beautiful garden
shes a small figure in the landscape
she approaches a temple where she stops to watch a wedding procession
a young bride and groom in traditional kimono walk under a parasol with their family
charlotte looks as the nervous young bride clutches her mothers hand
the young groom walks along with them
charlotte is moved by the whole scene the beauty of the temple and the wedding party
her eyes well up
she walks up a narrow path surrounded by red maple leaves
at the top of a little hill she comes up to a shrine
at its entrance she sees a tree covered in little white pieces of paper tied to its branches
she sees japanese people writing on the paper and tying them to the tree
charlotte writes her wish on a paper and ties it to a branch
exciting music plays as the talk game show starts
bob in an elegant suit goes out to meet the host
in japanese we hear youre quite a golfer
a translator translates
nodding i enjoy the sport
the translator translates four sentences longer and with added enthusiasm
after a few questions the host excitedly announces something to the audience in japanese
they scream the lights flash bob has no idea whats going on
a cloud of smoke reveals the iron chef with feathered hair wearing an th century waistcoat
a large red chef hat is placed on bobs head
they now have the competition for you with the iron chef
bob looks around as a counter is pulled up to him and now bob and the iron chef are at dueling counters
the host barks instructions in japanese an apron with a stuffed animal lobster on it is tied around bob the crowd cheers theres no way out
bob rides in the back of the presidential looking out the window at the city
he pulls a polaroid out of his pocket and looks at it
its charlotte peering over her shoulder with a little smile from their sake drenched night at nobus compound
melodramatic s japanese music plays
bob sits alone hating himself at the bar
the redheaded jazz singer takes a break and a seat next to him
in the harsh morning light bob wakes up in his bed
he hears the jazz singer singing in the shower midnight at the oasis
her red mane of hair passes frame as she ushers in room service
she seems to have taken over the whole room
he wants it all to go away
she walks off to the bathroom and theres a knock at the door
bob rushes to get it before she can
he opens the door a crack charlotte looking sweet is standing there
her hair is back in a pony tail
bobs just wearing a towel around his waist and his hair is sticking up
hes not in the mood he looks at her like he already hates himself doesnt need more help
im going to daikanyama do you want to come walk around
yes but no i cant right now
the singer starts singing again in the background
charlotte gives bob a look
oh i guess youre busy huh
i dont want to be
he watches charlotte walk away down the beige hall
bob is walking down the crowded street looking for charlotte when his cell phone rings
hello bob its me
cant hear hello

i couldnt hear you

a little girls voice shouts no
in the background
i guess shes busy
when are you coming home
her ballet recital is saturday dont forget
in the background the daughter calls for her mommy over and over and a dog starts barking
ok well travel safely

charlotte with sunglasses on leans against the wall as bob approaches
you cant get sushi anywhere in japan after oclock

no well find something around here
she goes with him
bob and charlotte are seated at a big booth in a corny shabu shabu restaurant
the jazz singer
the red head
bob looks at her like dont make it worse
well i guess shes more around your age
you guys could talk about things in common like growing up in the fifties
youre a brat wasnt there anyone else around to lavish you with attention
she scowls at him
the waitress brings them drinks she pours beer slowly and turns on a pot on the table to cook their food
charlotte looks at the menu it is filled with photos of different trays of meat
the waitress doesnt speak english
i cant tell the difference
they have trouble ordering but point to a picture on the menu
well have two of these
he makes some small talk she is bugged
what do you want to drink
he orders the drinks
so whered you go today
this is the end by the doors starts playing on the stereo
the waitress brings two huge trays of sliced raw beef
steam rises from the pot on the table
the song ends and another doors song comes on
theyre not going to play the whole album are they
they look across the table over the steam and meat at each other the whole thing is awful
in the darkness under covers charlotte is woken up by a loud fire alarm
the fire alarm booms as the hotel guests and staff hurry out of the hotel
amidst the crowd of hotel guests in their pajamas charlotte finds bob hes wearing a kimono and slippers
shes in boxer shorts and an undershirt and slippers
that lunch was the worst huh
she looks down at his feet stuffed into the little hotel slippers
when are you leaving
friendly im going to miss you
thats what you said the other night
well i mean it more now
and charlotte still in their pajamas sit at their usual spot at the bar with the bartender drinking cold sake
she lights two cigarettes and passes one to him
a new jazz band is now playing
the singer is full of enthusiasm as they start their stint at the park hyatt
im carl west and were thrilled to be joining you this week here at the ny bar in shinjuku
he sings where or when with all his heart
now old timers there bob and charlotte look at each other and chuckle
jt seems we stood and talked like this before we looked at each other in the same way thenr but i cant remember where or when
bob and charlotte sit there together
i dont want to go back tomorrow
but it doesnt last you have to go back sometime
why cant it last
i dont know it just doesnt reality changes things
we cant stay here forever unless maybe we started a jazz band
alt charlotte dialog i dont know it just doesnt reality changes things
and we cant stay here forever he looks over at her
the singer continues where or when as they sit there together the view sparkling
somethings that happen for the first time seem to be happening again and so it seems we have met before and laughed before and loved before but who knows where
bob and charlotte drunk in the elevator
he nods she pushes for him and for herself
they look at each other across the empty elevator both leaning against the walls
the elevator stops at he leans in to kiss her good night
they kiss like you would on the cheek but its closer to their mouths
the door shuts he missed his floor
the elevator continues up and stops on her floor
they kiss good night again and she gets out before the door closes
he watches the door close on her as she makes her way down the long beige hall
a fax comes through the machine in the empty room
a sexy executive woman asks bob for a light
he looks at her great legs as he lights her cigarette
he looks around keeping an eye out for charlotte
the group of commercial people arrive to see him off
he excuses himself for a moment and goes to a phone on a little table in the corner
bob picks up the house phone
hello can i have room
traditional japanese music plays on hold
i will connect you
bob gets the room voice mail
its me bob
ok i guess youre not there

he hangs up feeling lame
bob with his bags tries to call again
the commercial people and hotel staff crowd around to help him asking about his stay
im just leaving

e ok see you in a second
a member of the hotel staff brings him an envelope on a little silver tray
miss kawasaki gives him some gifts from their company in traditional japanese wrapping he doesnt know what to do with them and has to carry them
the executive woman from the bar walks up to him
he hangs up the phone
she looks at him like we could have had some fun
yeah yeah im going
he sees charlotte come out of the elevator
i have to go thanks bye
he rushes over to charlotte
she looks at his bag
just saying good bye to everyone before you leave
she hands him his jacket
she waits for him to say something more
he wants to tell her he loves her that she should come with him
the concierge tells him his car is here
youre leaving right now

she walks away
a hotel manager asks bob about his luggage another asks if he had a pleasant stay
charlotte gets in the elevator to go out the doors close on her back
its bright outside the main entrance
a presidential pulls up and the automatic door opens
bob squints as the bellboy in white gloves slowly loads his luggage into the trunk
in the backseat bob leans back on the little doily
the car pulls away
around the corner he looks down a crowded alley and sees charlottes blonde hair
can you pull over a second
the driver wearing white cloth gloves pulls the car over slowly
bob tries to open the door it wont open he has to wait for the automatic doors to open for him slowly
bob gets out and rushes down the street to where he saw charlotte
the street is crowded with japanese people and different colored umbrellas its sunny out with a light rain
music blasts from speakers on the street and there is some promo going on with girls handing out little cologne samples
bob looks around for her but only sees dark hair umbrellas and super tan japanese kids
in the distance an umbrella moves to reveal charlotte
but she cant hear him over the loudspeaker
he rushes to her
she turns and we see she is crying
the music swells
he embraces her holding her close to him in the crowd
why are you crying
sincere ill miss you
he kisses her hugs her good bye
i know im going to miss you too
he holds her close
charlotte watches bob as he reaches his car he turns and looks at her
she smiles at him and is lost in the crowd
bob gets into his car
charlotte walks with the crowd as they go on their way
back in the presidential alone bob leans against the little doily
they drive off
he looks out the window bobs happy hes going home hes happy he came to tokyo
tokyo goes past his window
