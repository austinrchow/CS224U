he who signs a lease must pay rent

how can you take the last penny out of a mans pocket
turns back shrugs i have to
im a landlord
shouting to heaven oh lord hear my plea
he maketh a blight on the land
to the lord dont pay attention
biting his knuckle nnnnn
he sighs ill have to make another call
to bloom quietly have you been there all this time
and did you see and hear everything
then what do you have to say for yourself
shouts who are you
what do you want
why are you loitering in my hallway
speak dummy speak
why dont you speak
get a hold of yourself
take a deep breath let it out slowly and tell me who you are
words tumble from his mouth as he exhales im leo bloom im an accountant im from whitehall and marks i was sent here to do your books and im terribly
sorry i caught you with the old lady
he has run out of breath caught you with the old lady
come in mr
so youre an accountant eh
timidly yes sir
then account for yourself
do you believe in god
do you believe in gold
why are you looking up old ladys dresses
bit of a pervert eh
do the books
theyre in that desk over there
how dare you condemn me without knowing all the facts
but sir im not condem
im having a rhetorical conversation
to himself how humiliating
you know who i used to be
the king of broadway
six shows running at once
lunch at delmonicos
two hundred dollar suits
look at me
look at me now
im wearing a cardboard belt
i used to have thousands of investors begging pleading to put their money into a max bialystock production
look at my investors now
gestures at pictures hundreds of little old ladies stopping off at max bialystocks office to grab a last thrill on the way to the cemetery
you have exactly ten seconds to change that disgusting look of pity into one of enormous respect
do the books
do the books
sighing yes sir
to himself windows so filthy cant tell if its day or night out there
voice over as camera follows rolls look at that
a white rolls royce
thats it baby when you got it flaunt it
off screen koff koff
i assume you are making those cartoon noises to attract my attention
am i correct in my assumption you fish faced enemy of the people
i have hurt your feelings
good what is it
sir may i speak to you for a minute
looking at his watch go
you have fifty eight seconds
well sir it seems
interrupting you have forty eight seconds left
speedily in looking at your books ive discovered that
interrupting twenty eight seconds hurry hurry youre using up your time
bialystock i cannot function under these conditions
youre making me extremely nervous
what is that
if its nothing why cant i see it
shrieking in panic my blanket
give me my blue blanket
here dont panic
clutching his blanket im sorry
i dont like people touching my blue blanket
its not important
its a minor compulsion
i can deal with it if i want to
its just that ive had it ever since i was a baby and
i find it very comforting
to himself they come here
they all come here
how do they find me
recovering his dignity mr
yes prince mishkin what can we do for you
this is hardly a time for levity
ive discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play
according to the backers list you raised
but the show you produced only cost fifty eight thousand
theres two thousand dollars unaccounted for
i went to a turkish bath who cares
the show was a flop
what difference does it make
it makes a great deal of difference
if they found out you could go to prison
why should they find out
its only two thousand dollars bloom do me a favor move a few decimal points around
you can do it
youre an accountant
the word count is part of your title
aghast but thats cheating
its not cheating
bloom look at me
look at me
other men sail through life
bialystock has struck a reef
bloom im going under
i am being sunk by a society that demands success when all i can offer is failure
bloom im reaching out to you
dont send me to jail
oh dear oh dear oh dear oh dear
ill do it
ill do it
thank you bloom
i knew i could con you
oh its all right
pouring over the accounts now lets see two thousand dollars
that isnt much
im sure i can hide it somewhere
after all the department of internal revenue isnt interested in a show that flopped
you figure it out
im gonna take a little nap
crossing to couch wake me if theres a fire
now lets see if we add these figures we get
musing to himself heh heh heh amazing
its absolutely amazing
but under the right circumstances a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit
its quite possible
if he were certain the show would fail a man could make a fortune
at a loss yes what
what you were saying
what was i saying
you were saying that under the right circumstances a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit
smiling yes its quite possible
you keep saying that but you dont tell me how
how could a producer make more money with a flop than with a hit
its simply a matter of creative accounting
let us assume just for the moment that you are a dishonest man
well its very easy
you simply raise more money than you really need
what do you mean
youve done it yourself only you did it on a very small scale
what did i do
you raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play
what did it get me
im wearing a cardboard belt
but thats where you made your error
you didnt go all the way
you see if you were really a bold criminal you could have raised a million
but the play only cost to produce
and how long did it run
you could have raised a million dollars put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the rest
but what if the play was a hit
oh youd go to jail
if the play were a hit youd have to pay off the backers and with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go around get it
aha aha aha aha aha aha
so in order for the scheme to work wed have to find a sure fire flop
your scheme you bloody little genius
i meant no scheme
i merely posed a little academic accounting theory
its just a thought
bloom worlds are turned on such thoughts
dont you see bloom
darling bloom glorious bloom its so simple
step one we find the worst play in the world a sure flop
step two i raise a million dollars theres a lot of little old ladies in this world
step three you go back to work on the books
phoney lists of backers one for the government one for us
you can do it bloom youre a wizard
step four we open on broadway and before you can say step five we close on broadway
step six we take our million dollars and fly to rio de janiero
sings ah rio rio by the seao meo myo meo
afraid of the scheme afraid of the dance afraid of bialystock mr
youre holding me too tight
im an honest man
you dont understand
leading bloom as he talks no bloom you dont understand
this is fate this is destiny
theres no avoiding it
the back of his head practically touching the floor mr
bialystock not more than five minutes ago against my better judgment i doctored your books
that sir is the ultimate extent of my criminal life
to himself oh i fell on my keys
he shifts slightly to make himself more comfortable ive got to get out of here
angrily hovering over bloom you miserable cowardly wretched little caterpillar
dont you ever want to become a butterfly
dont you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory
his eyes widened in terror youre going to jump on me
youre going to jump on me
i know youre going to jump on me like nero jumped on poppea
by now he is shrieking poppea
she was his wife
and she was unfaithful to him
so he got mad and he jumped on her
up and down up and down until he squashed her like a bug
please dont jump on me
shouting and jumping up and down next to bloom im not going to jump on you
rolling away in terror aaaaaaaaaa
hoisting bloom to his feet will you get a hold on yourself
up on his feet and running for cover dont touch me
dont touch me
what are you afraid of
im not going to hurt you
whats the matter with you
im having hysterics
i cant stop
when i get like this i cant stop
im hysterical and im wet
holding his face im in pain
and im wet
and im still hysterical
it doesnt help
it only increases my sense of danger
what can i do
what can i do
youre getting me hysterical
go away from me
you frighten me
he indicates the sofa sit over there
im way over here
is that better
its a little better but you still look angry
he smiles sweetly good
thats very nice
i think im coming out of it now
im definitely coming out of it
thank you for smiling
it helped a great deal
for want of something sensible well you know what they say smile and the world smiles with you
to himself the man should be in a straight jacket
to bloom feeling better
much thank you
but i am a little lightheaded
maybe i should eat something
hysterics have a way of severely depleting ones blood sugar you know
they certainly do
they certainly do
come let me take you to lunch
thats very kind of you mr
bialystock but i
interrupting nonsense nonsense my dear boy
i lowered your blood sugar but least i could do is raise it a little
and i promise you faithfully i wont discuss that silly scheme to make a million dollars anymore
