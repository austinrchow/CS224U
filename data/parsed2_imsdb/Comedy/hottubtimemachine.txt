hot tub time machine
camera pans down to reveal a hot tub full of hot chicks in bikinis
they splash about playfully
then as the girls scream and scramble for safety the beast roars and it becomes the adam coleman late s good looking sweet natured face is in a great mood
as he packs a suitcase
ready for the wildest bachelor party of all time
lily early s shirt and jeans hot in a smart and classy sense walks in the room smiling
you know it
im gonna bang all sorts of chicks this weekend
thats not the answer i was looking for
adam gives his beautiful fiancee a playful kiss
she shows him some photos
look what i found
a bunch of teenagers and somethings party in a large hot tub at a ski resort
it looks like the most fun ever
check out that young stud
can you believe hes about to get married
lily and adam look through more photos of a young adam partying at a ski resort with his friends in full s ski gear on a mountain
eating pizza at papa enzos stuffing their faces
drinking beers at the brew haus an awesome pub
in the hot tub with six girls
adam snatches the last photo from her
ignore that one
i love you
adam you didnt know me yet
as adam goes back to packing lily leafs through some more of the photos
she stops at one and her expression changes
lily shows adam a photo a smoking hot ski bunny blonde svelte leg warmers
im not sure
lily shows adam another photo young adam with his arm around the ski bunny who looks like she was ambushed for the photo
off her look you didnt know me yet
lily still looks at him a little hard
lily i was
she had boobs and a face
of course im gonna take her picture
lily still looks a little bothered
do you still think of her
of course not
i think of you
as adam goes to embrace her hold on
lily goes into the closet
she comes out a moment later with a cardboard box which she empties onto the bed
about fifty porno magazines spill out ranging from tits monthly to black ass
how did you know where i hid my
lily carefully picks up a brochure from the pile holding it by the corner not wanting to touch it
from adams pov we see the brochure a ski brochure featuring jennie on the cover
you caught me
about jennie okeefe
without missing a beat about two hours ago when you were on the phone with your mother
tell me how im supposed to let you go to your bachelor party and not be a basket case
what are you so worried about
im worried that youre still thinking about this girl
baby the girl in that picture was nothing more than a crush
i could never get her and theres no possibility ill ever be with her
she was a total stranger
lily gets a curious look on her face
youre into strangers
well not the creepy your mom was in an accident now come with me kind
but yeah the hot lady in the supermarket kind of stranger
you have to admit its kinda hot
so youre saying if you and i didnt know each other it would be pretty hot if we fooled around
you kidding me
it would be fucking incredible
lily smiles seductively as adam starts to get it
wait a minute
are you suggesting
adam excitedly heads for the door
ok ill go down the hall
you get into character
points at her this fucking rules
adam leaves the room and lily removes her shirt talking sexy and slowly building the fantasy
oh im all alone in this big house
cheerleading camp just ended and i need to get out of these sweaty clothes
love where youre going with this baby
keep it up
she unbuttons her pants and slides down her jeans
my panties are so tight against my firm naked body
you should probably take them off
are you gonna let me do this
you were just about to take off your panties
she slowly slides out of her panties kicking them away
now shes totally naked
she continues to role play
it feels so good to be so naked
i hope no one can see me
just then a black man late s handsome j crew saunters through the bedroom door holding a coffee and all riled up
ok so this asshole in front of me at the donut place is whoa
lily covers up and screams
get out of here
he spills the coffee on his hands and their rug as he turns
ill clean it up
thats gonna stain though
he heads for the door just as adam comes in wearing a mailman hat and nothing else
special delivery for jesus christ
the black man doesnt know which way to look
he covers his eyes and drips coffee as he blindly steps toward the door
just tell me when im in the clear
adam wheels his suitcase down the front path of this modest well kept suburban home as a recovered dressed embarrassed and somewhat shell shocked lily follows with a small bag
they both stop yards short of a range rover where the black man nick waits in the car waving
i cant wait for you to come back and marry me
wow thats crazy
adam looks almost like it just hit him
tell me again i have nothing to worry about
babe look at nick
in the car nick air drums to whatevers on the radio
you think with him in charge were gonna get into any kind of trouble
well probably eat too much pizza and ill twist my ankle getting off the ski lift
have an awesome bachelor party
not too awesome
hands him bag i got you something
adam looks in the bag
he puts it in his backpack
she looks like she was expecting a different reaction but she lets it go
he kisses her
let me see your phone
he takes it out
i told you ill call you when she snatches it out of his hands
adam looks confused as she pockets the phone
despite my anxiety im not gonna be one of those women who wants an update every ten minutes
even though i do want an update every ten minutes
lily looks a bit trepidatious
just make sure whatever happens youre back for the rehearsal dinner
i totally trust you
im a lame o
well at least youre a cute lame o
lily leans in and they nuzzle their noses together in a disgusting display of affection
a flash goes off
from the car nick holds up his iphone
im more than willing to forget about earlier but this shits going on facebook
nick drives through suburbia while adam rides shotgun
i have no idea what facebook is
my phone has a button that says send to facebook
ive been sending shit there for months
adam looks out the window smiling
im so psyched about this weekend
im gonna help you make up for all the good times you missed when you were being a responsible member of society
youre a good friend
im sorry for putting my career and self sufficiency above bowling night
this trip represents everything awesome about being a dude
were gonna drink too much eat whatever we want
i might not even change my socks
live the dream
best of all we dont have to answer to anyone
nicks phone rings and he answers it with his built in bluetooth
his phone voice is a little more sensitive
three goddamn bags of pretzels
trying to save face im with adam honey
a little calmer nick what have i told you about buying snacks that arent on sale
you said not to do it
and what did you do
i bought three bags of pretzels
but im gonna eat them
thats not the point
dont do it again
nick and adam exchange an embarrassing glance
call me from the road
adam say hi to lily
ok i sure wi click
for a moment there is an uncomfortable silence
dont her parents own the supermarket
the whole damn chain
just be thankful lily doesnt have any family money
nothing makes your dick softer
nicks car pulls into the lot of a rundown motel
adam looks confused and slightly nervous
this looks like a place where people die
mostly from murder
a bald miserable looking guy in his late s lou exits a room carrying two shopping bags
he gets in the back seat
adam looks happy to see him
yes im living in a transient motel
lets get that purple elephant out of the room
dude it looks nice
i hate your guts
re the bags whatd you bring
all my belongings
so youre sorta like a bum now huh
in a sense
lou sits in the backseat voraciously eating a bowl of cereal as the other guys are up front
our system is fucked gentlemen
you tell me how a whore wife can fuck some black dude no offense and still take her cuckold of a husband for all hes got
why would i take offense to that
because hes black
and because hes fucking my wife
and because youre black
and because of all the oversensitive horrible garbage
you know what
forget no offense
are you offended
then shut the fuck up
shes got a hell of an attorney
yes and thank you so very much for giving her the referral
she told me it was for a friend
your wife likes black dick now
im gonna slaughter you in your sleep tonight
turns to lou genuine thanks for coming man
nicks car pulls up across from a nice apartment building as a well dressed well groomed overly polished looking young guy in his s jacob comes out carrying a messenger
the guys watch jacob carefully cross the street
oh adams stupid brothers coming
drive away before he gets in the car
i know jacobs kind of a douche but im trying to be closer to him since mom died
jacob gets in the back next to lou
hows it going
good to see you
you look dirty and you smell bad
you look gay and you smell like a basket of fancy soaps
how is that to your advantage
hes not gay
what are you again
you have sex with trains
for your information i fuck chicks
for your information you fuck dudes
yeah well at least im young and my lifes full of potential
i hear youre homeless now
to nick and adam you told him
i hate all you people
will you two please shake hands and make up
were gonna be spending a lot of time together
jacob distractedly texts on his phone
yeah about that
why arent we going to aspen
its gonna be fun
and with that the guys travel in silence for a few moments the lifeblood drained from the car
ive gotta take a shit
lou walks from the bathroom back to the table where adam nick and jacob sit and eat
that was an ugly experience
i dont wanna hear about it
in a few years when im dying of an exotic disease that causes my penis to bleed until it falls off someone remember to tell the hospital to check out
the filthy crapper at the albany rest stop
its the aids monkey of toilets
the guys put down their sandwiches
i dont know how youre doing it man
i mean lauries hot dont get me wrong
but one vagina
thats the sacrifice
jacob nods agreeing with lous concern
and youre ok with that
i dont know your sexual history but you sure you got it out of your system
i did ok for myself
he didnt do that well for himself
yeah isnt lily your fourth
so youre averaging like one girl every eight years
assuming i got laid when i was zero
that would be awesome
adam gives lou a distasteful look
maybe some cold feet but thats normal
thank you everyone for your concern
just looking out for you
thats what brothers do right
they look out for each other
takes a moment is this about something else
no lets do this
im sorry i wasnt around when you were growing up ok
i was in college
and then i was working
someone had to take responsibility
i said forget it
guys come on
lets move past it
this is gonna be a fun weekend
i still say vermont sucks
youre confusing vermont with yourself
this weekend is going to be incredible and you will not ruin it for me
softens to jacob you might like it
havenhurst is pretty awesome
jacob shrugs but lou gets excited
fuck yeah it is
were gonna ski the trail and bone some tail
youll have to bone some of that tail for me man
youll bone your own
no i wont
adam trust me
biggest mistake of my life not fucking a whore at my bachelor party
thats the biggest mistake of your life
and hes not making that same mistake
im not having sex with anyone this weekend
lou looks at adam trying to figure things out
youre not having sex this weekend
im not having sex this weekend
without the winking
im pretty sure you dont
nicks car transitions from the highway to the mountains to the woods as we track the drive
finally the car passes a welcome to havenhurst sign
welcome to havenhurst
the car winds through the main thoroughfare
rather than a quaint ski town this place resembles a suburban nightmare with strip malls and chain restaurants
its the exact opposite of the fun town we saw in adams photos
the guys look out the windows wearing bummed expressions
so this is the coolest town ever
the brew haus is a pf changs
lou notices a tgi fridays with a sign advertising a hannah montana d experience
he looks utterly disgusted
i dont even have the heart to tell you what i just fucking saw
but say goodbye to papa enzos
this town sucks
what the fuck is going on
the car climbs a twisty part of the road
please god let it still be there
best strip club ever
the car rounds the corner and a sign comes into view
the beginning reads pink
the car continues to climb and the whole sign comes into view pinkberry
i wanna die
sweet theres a pinkberry here
the car pulls into the parking lot of this rundown lodge
the guys walk in and the first thing they notice is a bunch of cats that wander anywhere they want
the large living room area off the lobby features a fire place that has been bricked shut
toddlers and elderly people lounge and cry and nap
what have you done to us
im not playing drinking games with my grandma
ok so the place skews a little older
lets check in
were not spending our time inside anyway
the guys walk silently behind a middle aged bellhop phil who struggles to wrangle their bags on a shaky hand truck
his job is made more difficult because he only has one arm
he grunts and curses his way down the hall on the slow and laborious journey
but when adam tries to pick up a bag
im not gonna tell you again
i fuckin got it
adam backs off
this guys a dick
no fuck that
hes a dick
oooh tough guy
hes gotta be mister america
go fuck yourself
phil finally drops their bags at their room and then im ready to be tipped
you sir have no tact
nick gives phil a bill and he walks off down the hall leaving the guys outside their room
in this room lies the beginning of our awesome weekend
or a continuation of everything thats sucked so far
yeah i bet its gonna be lame as shit in there
the furniture probably smells like mold
i say we go to foxwoods
i actually kinda like that idea
everyone looks at adam
lets give it a chance
we dont know for sure that the room sucks
nick nods appreciating the optimism
he opens the door the room sucks
the ancient furniture looks like it smells like mold and there is nothing redeemable about the place
ok so now we know
the guys drag their bags in and depressingly take stock of the situation presently the dirty old room
what the hell is with this place
its like a stephen king novel except not as cool
well feel a lot better once we hit the slopes
plus i know theres one thing to look forward to
on a patio outside their suite our guys stare at a kick ass top of the line hot tub
spacious seating plenty of jets underwater lighting
adam nick and lou look energized
at least some things never change
whats the big deal about a hot tub
shame on you
theres plenty of time for tubbin
at the top of the mountain adam nick and lou look ridiculous in tight retro style neon ski jumpsuits
jacob on a snowboard is the only one dressed in current attire
re their outfits whens the last time you guys actually went skiing
its been a few years
i think we look good
then youre an idiot
all right we race down the mountain
loser buys first round
premium shit only
you gonna be all right
what does that mean
i dunno do black dudes ski
of course black dudes ski
arent i wearing skis
im just not sure youre representative
youre calling me an uncle tom
i dont even know what that means
it means black dudes ski
pulls down goggles catch ya at the bottom
nick takes off and
gets about feet before he hits a grassy patch and falls over
black dudes dont ski
hows the bottom
nick wears his going out clothes and walks along the main drag talking into his phone
it is clear that he is being constantly interrupted on the other end of the conversation
no the black ones
without the pleats
because the pleats make me look fat
no i put it on the amex
because im the best man
i know but im organizing
im gonna get cash fr im gonna get im gonna collect cash from the guys
i love you too
nick hangs up and we see that adam lou and jacob have been walking with him listening to his end of the conversation
ok whos ready to sink their teeth into a delicious dinner
our four guys looks miserable as they sit around a table at this popular chinese food chain restaurant
their overzealous waiter aiden makes a big production of mixing sauces like hes emeril
you fellas look like you can handle some spice
im gonna knock it up a bit
throw some chili sauce in there
oh yeah there it is
this is gonna knock your socks off
nicks expression looks like he wants to kill the guy
the waiter walks away and nick raises his glass in a toast
id like to propose a toast
to my best friend adam
he may be throwing his life away but at least hes throwing it away with a hot chick at his side
the guys laugh and clink glasses
and so what if you only have one vagina for the rest of your life
speaking as someone whos seen your wifes vagina its definitely one of the good ones
lou and jacob look confused but clink glasses anyway as adam mouths what the fuck to nick
jacob raises his glass
to my brother i say thank you for including me
i promise to try to make the most of it
the guys look confused at the backhanded graciousness
thanks for coming man
it means a lot to me
jacob nods halfheartedly
the guys hug and clink glasses and excitedly chatter
just then a manager appears at the table and clears his throat
youre going to have to keep it down
come on man
its our friends bachelor party
were just trying to roast him a little bit
well if you like roasts i suggest the roast peking duck
its out of this world and as im sure aiden has told you he can make it quite spicy
the guys look bothered
but as for the noisy kind of roast thats going to have to stop
we have many other guests trying to enjoy the p
the manager walks away
for a moment the guys are quiet
lou takes a bite of his food chewing slowly
this kung pau chicken pairs very nicely with the cab
very impressive choice nick
also this is the worst bachelor party ive ever been to
everyone puts down their forks cathartically fed up
you had great intentions
no ones blaming you
im blaming him
im totally blaming him
i didnt even want to go skiing
ok ill admit this trip is not off to the best start
but were due for a victory
nick thinks and actually gets an idea
he snaps his fingers
a lightbulb goes off for adam too
lou gets up and throws down his napkin
why did we even bother with dinner
adam and nick get up too
guys im still hungry
quiet men are talking
get you guys some to go boxes
i would like you to die
and then i would like you to leave
aiden walks away freaked out
lou turns back to the guys
its tub time
lou adam and nick all have huge smiles as they gaze at the tub
they each hold a ton of booze
jacob looks indifferent and a little turned off by it all
lou strips down to his underwear and climbs in
oh my god
the water is perfect
he pours a vodka and slams it back
adam climbs in with lou pouring his own drink
i really dont see the appeal
its like a glorified bath
the hot tub is the whole thing
you ski all day
then you hit the town get trashed and lure some fine ladies back to the lodge for some good old fashioned tubbin
nick cracks a beer and pats jacob on the back
so the towns dead
fine we skip that part and go right to the tub
if theres fun to be had the tub is a good start
nick gets in
now its just jacob outside the hot tub
the other three guys are already starting to look more energized and happy splashing around
after another beat of consideration
jacob strips down and gets in
as he submerges he actually starts to loosen up a bit and smiles
im not convinced this is anything more than a bath but its nice
hit him with some bubbles
coming right up
adam cranks a knob
as the bubbles comes to life we begin a tubbin montage over reel reals i like to move it
in the tub the guys drink like fish pouring various combinations of vodka red bull mountain dew bacardi and anything else they can get their hands on
jacobs laptop is propped on the edge of the tub playing better off dead
every so often one of our guys takes a drink playing a game the rules of which only they know
adam takes a big bite of the sandwich lily gave him
nick uses his iphone to take video and pictures
more drinking games
the guys wear funny hats and roll dice on a piece of wood
adam has to drink some tub water
the guys keep reaching into adams backpack for mixers
nick adam and lou laugh
then lou lifts up jacobs head which he has been forcibly holding under water
jacob coughs and spits out water and looks pissed
then he smiles and helps submerge nicks head in the same way
another bottle of vodka killed
another empty red bull his the patio
a bear eats some doritos that have been left on a picnic table
yards away in the tub the guys laugh and taunt it
lou bleeds from where the bear has obviously scratched him across the chest
still he dances in the tub
just for an instant did we see that
the guys are black guys and one white guy before changing back
the guys wear their snowsuits in the tub
adam very dangerously jumps in attached to a snowboard
the cuts get quicker and quicker as hands reach into the backpack
more red bull
the cuts speed up and intensify until finally in a brilliant flash of light we as the light of a new day spills into havenhurst we find all four of
our guys passed out in the hot tub the water calm
a kitten licks lous face
lou jolts awake and pukes on the kitten sending it flying
this wakes up everyone and they stir to life inspecting the carnage mostly hangover related
oh my god i wanna die
i need a vitamin water
adam reaches in his backpack taking out two choices
red bull or fresca
jacob takes the fresca as lou inspects the claw marks
that fucking bear got me good
yeah he did
but we showed him didnt we
if by showing him you mean we laughed and he got bored and wandered off into the woods with your sneakers then yeah we got him good
lou picks up adams half eaten sandwich and takes a bite
you just puked
thats why im eating your sandwich
im fucking starving
their gaze turns to the mountain peak on which is a fresh layer of powder
it looks like perfect skiing conditions
lets do it
as the guys walk across the front of the lodge they pass some well preserved cars all parked together a pontiac fiero a vw golf and a ford mustang coupe
what is this a shitty car club
the guys completely miss the billboards across the street coming soon the most spaced out mel brooks film yet
a surfing max headroom with a can of coke and the tag catch the wave
a bull terrier named spuds mckenzie parking with some hot babes and a shitload of bud light
in quick cuts the guys hit the slopes in his ridiculous snowsuit nick skis down the mountain
with the new snowfall he expertly glides along
jacob applies some lip balm and flies down the mountain on a snowboard
people glare at him with confused expressions
adam uses the snowplow method to slowly descend
hes a beginner skier
he takes the time to look at the surroundings and notices a younger hotter crowd skiing today
lots of blonde ski bunnies wearing pastel colors
well this place has improved
in the lift line lou passes a guy wearing a big headband
adam shares a gondola with nick as they make their way up the mountain
a dude in sunglasses sits across napping
adam takes a flask out of his backpack
he and nick look over their shoulders like scheming kids as they take a nip
im really glad we stayed
its gonna be good to get away for a couple of days
i mean not like i want to be away from lily
believe me i know
i love her
but you guys are right
im gonna be with her for the rest of my life
for the rest of your goddamn life
it gets easier right
no offense but watching you talk with courtney youre gonna be fine
youll settle in get the premium cable package the usual deal
youll wake up every morning comforted by the fact that your wife doesnt wield her familys wealth over your head like a hangmans noose
adam looks concerned as nick wistfully goes on
youll breathe the air of life making the occasional decision maybe get some lawn furniture
how about steak for dinner
yes lets get that juice machine i saw on tv
lets fucking go for it
nick stares off into the distance
sorry i lost myself there
adam and nick look at the guy across from them who presently offers his ski goggles on which is a mountain of cocaine
that is a lot of cocaine
i feel like were in scarface
only with skiing
its good shit
im gonna pass
yeah im good
the dude removes his sunglasses
he has a dead look in his eyes studying nick and adam
you guys a couple of spazzes
you miami vice
which ones crockett
which ones crockett
im crockett obviously
thats the don johnson one right
the dude flips out a switchblade
you show me youre not spazzes
were not spazzes
the dude extends the coke once more
at the top of the mountain nick looks wide awake
adam on the other hand looks coked out of his skull
he sniffs fidgets clenches his jaw and looks generally up
adam you gotta chill
you just did one line
ive never ridden the horse before
youre not riding the horse
the horse is heroin
adam cant stop moving and fidgeting
i dont know what kind of animal im riding but its the best animal of all time
i feel great
adam uses his ski poles to push off the top of the mountain and he goes flying down the slope
adam tucks down still clenching his teeth
he picks up speed as he flies down the mountain like a racer
nick has to pull up and slow down in the name of safety
he zips along never changing course or slowing
he barely misses a few trees
but he cant stop himself before the collision knocks adam and the girl to the ground and finally stops adams hyper speed descent
adam gets up and shakes the cobwebs
what a rush
he notices the girl on the ground and goes to help her up
oh wow are you ok
no thanks to you asshole
the girl stands up in a very hot and awesome manner shaking the snow from her luxurious blonde hair
it twinkles in the sunlight
as she turns to face adam normal speed resumes
and he sees who it is jennie okeefe
jennie squints at adam trying to place him
do i know you
he stares at her not believing what hes seeing
he still looks loopy from the coke
just then a a too blond mirror sunglass wearing feathered hair striped jumpsuited guy blaine skis up and grabs adam
im gonna serve you a knuckle sandwich airhead
you all right babe
i think so
blaines toadies tad and chaz ski up behind him as blaine angrily rips adams lift ticket from his jacket
your lift tickets been revoked
blaine throws it on the ground and laughs to his friends
a la lethal weapon diplomatic immunity
blaine looks confused as adam rips blaines lift ticket but he ends up ripping blaines jacket too
sorry i was trying to
you can probably patch that up
blaine pulls adam close by the collar and clenches his fist
youre dead meat scumbag
just then snow powder flies in blaines face
blaine lets go of adam as jacob snowboards up and stops short coming to his brothers side
there you are
my brothers had a few too many triple venti nonfat lattes if you know what i mean
genuine to adam are you ok
blaine looks confused
chaz and tad look enamored with jacob
dude they let you bring a skateboard on the mountain
its a snowboard
you know no wheels
man not to get all fag on you but im digging your fresh threads bro
adam and blaine look equally confused with whats going on
jacob takes the compliment well like he deserves it
its mostly north face
a little ems
whatever it is it works
what are you doing with this boner
you should be skiing with us
blaine looks really annoyed with his friends
i mean thats if blaine thinks its cool and everything
blaine takes a deep breath annoyed
get your spaz brother out of here
and for his sake i dont wanna see him back on my mountain
youre welcome any time though
adam picks up his backpack which fell off during the collision
he stares at jennie again and smiles
you look just like this girl
i had the biggest crush on her blaine grabs the bag out of adams hand and shoves adam away
this is mine now
adam looks at blaine angrily but jacob holds him back
lets just go
jacob ushers adam off the slope as blaine shoulders the bag
adam and jacob walk in the front door
gone are the children and old people
the living room off the lobby presently hosts what appears to be an amazing s retro party
a radio plays miami sound machines conga
girls and guys wear printed sweaters feathered dos and neon leggings
its something out of a mid s aspen photo shoot
nick walks in behind them looking as confused as them
he turns up his palms and shakes his head at a loss for words
what is going on
lou strolls up to the guys with his arms around two hot chicks
he looks elated
im so glad youre here
i want to introduce you to michelle and sandy
these lovely ladies are having a roller skating party next weekend and no offense but fuck your wedding im totally coming back
by the way
lou rolls out a ziplock bag full of cocaine
theres coke everywhere around here
this place rules
lou dips into the coke and rubs it on his gums and we the suite looks a little fresher
the furniture is the same but everythings in better shape
it looks almost new
adam jacob and lou sit in the main room with the tv on as nick emerges from a bedroom
has anyone else noticed that things around here are weird as shit
adam and nick nod
lou shakes his head
dont you ruin this
if you wake me from this dream ill kill you
what do you think happened
i have no idea but look
jacob turns up the volume on the tv
the news airs
the dow jones industrial average closed just above today
in other news the tower commission has rebuked president reagan for not controlling his national security staff in an arms for hostages deal with iran
for a moment the guys sit there in stunned silence
with genuine emotion were in
everyone looks stunned and dazed
what are we gonna do
i have plans next weekend
we all have plans
its my fucking wedding
now hold on we dont know for sure that were in
the tv shows a real commercial for the commodore computer with a jingle that sings are you keeping up with the commodore cause the commodores keeping up with you
when its over
ok were in
adam stands up completely losing it
what the fuck is going on
nick stands up and calmly takes charge
i think i know whats happened
and when were done discussing it were all gonna feel a lot better
everyone looks to nick who seems to have the answer
two words black hole
he lets it hang in the air for a moment as if its suddenly going to gel for everyone
but the guys look confused
i saw a special on the science channel
and guess what
sometimes this happens
and the best thing for us to do is to stay put
the universe will eventually reverse itself and work out this little glitch
nick sits down looking satisfied in his know it all ness
this is a big glitch
yeah youre an idiot
black holes are in space
not at a ski resort
so does this mean we get to go to girls locker rooms and see them naked and they cant see us
no we traveled through time
were not invisible
lou looks upset
under his breath im still gonna do it
guys ignoring the ridiculousness of how we got here for a moment black hole
how are we supposed to get back
for a moment everyone sits and absorbs the question
then we find a scientist
our guys wait nervously near a reception desk above which is the ibm logo
lou reads a magazine
this dukakis guy seems like he might be the real deal
an affable man in a suit approaches
gentlemen how may i help you
were waiting for a scientist
i am a scientist
wheres your white coat
im not that kind of scientist
lou stands up and throws down his magazine
this is bullshit
i told you wait a minute
just tell him
you tell him adam
this is ridiculous
nothings too ridiculous in the name of science
were from the future
get the fuck out of here
a security guard escorts our guys out of the building
that went well
lou starts walking off by himself
where are you going
lou points to his watch
the guys look at him confused
if its the pf changs will be gone which means the brew haus still stands
they have wet t shirt contests on saturdays
the guys eyebrows raise
after a moment well maybe one drink
just to confirm
a wet t shirt contest is underway on a stage
whitesnake on the juke pac man on the tables and cheap beers in the mugs this is an amazing brew pub
our guys sit in the back wearing pine valley lodge shirts
there are many empties on the table and they look very drunk
in a roped off area in the corner a cocky younger phil the one armed bellhop wields a chainsaw that he uses to carve an ice sculpture impressing the bar
he has both arms
its that bellhop
should we warn him
i dont want to see this go down
phil tosses the chainsaw in the air and
he expertly catches it seamlessly continuing to carve
a girl leans in and gives him a kiss
fuck that guy
on the stage two girls compete for wettest t shirt
they both decide that no t shirt is the wettest option
god bless our country
in a daze were in
you can stop saying that
i dont think its making a difference
seriously we have to get back
kinda losing it we seriously have to get back
the guys subdue adam as a big haired waitress brings drinks
here ya go guys
three buds one bartles and james
the guys all stare at her like shes a museum artifact
i have lipstick on my teeth
nick sips his wine cooler feeling the eyes of the others on him
hey if its available im ordering it
i always wanted one of these when i was little
the waitress puts down the check
jacob picks it up realizing something
to the waitress can you give us a second
she walks away as jacob turns to the guys
this is gonna be a problem
he takes out his wallet showing his credit cards and cash
guys were in trouble
our cards arent gonna work and our new money looks fake
the guys look concerned but then nick notices something ive got an idea
as nick gets up and approaches the businessmen adam looks around the room and by the bar he spots
he stares at her from across the room
lou and jacob notice
i still cant believe its really her
shes aged remarkably well
why dont you just go talk to her
i should go talk to her
to apologize of course
you know nothing inappropriate
adam gets up
he slowly makes his way over across the room
jennie is talking to two other girls as adam approaches
he lurks near them like a creep
jennie eventually notices him as he keeps stealing glances
she doesnt look happy
listen putz if youre gonna try to attack me again my boyfriend will be here soon
hell kick your ass
adam tries to be casual
no ass kicking
i just wanted to say im sorry about earlier
i lost control of the old skis there
looks like i shoulda taken another one of your classes
when did you take my class
certainly not when i was a kid
i mean that would make no sense
adam tries to recover
i was here for a convention
and regular tools
all sorts of tools
im big into tools
it was a couple years ago
jennie looks very suspect of adam
have a good night
jennie starts to walk away with her friends
hey where ya going
she ignores him but one of her friends quietly lags behind
quietly to adam are you with that guy over there
she discretely points out jacob
yeah hes my brother
she takes adams palm and writes something on it
theres a party later tonight at this address
make sure he comes with you
hes way boss
adam walks back to his friends
howd it go
he shows them his palm
we got invited to a party later
what are we gonna do until then
how about figure out how the hell to get back to the present day
nick walks back to the table and slams down a pile of cash
its a thousand bucks
where did you get that money
nick points out the japanese businessmen
sold them my ipod
jacob looks incredulous
that was not a good idea
you left so much money on the table
its a fucking ipod
you couldve gotten a lot more
thats not what i looking at watch fellas we are not making progress and were losing time
adam dont worry
times not moving forward in the future
uh yeah it is
lest we forget the lessons learned from bill and ted
well then i give you back to the future
thats not fair
you cant go right to back to the future
back to the future had a time machine
well so did bill and ted
wait thats it
i cant believe im about to say this but i think we have a time machine
adam all we did is get drunk in the hot tub
everyones eyes go wide
puts it together a hot tub time machine
all four guys soak in the tub
they toast with drinks
here goes nothing
they simultaneously down their drinks
like the chimps in each of them begins fiddling with knobs and pushing on lights trying to find the magic button
after a few moments well it was worth a shot
angle widens to reveal other people in the tub
a guy and girl make out two stoners pass a joint and one topless chick just chills out
stares at girl i love this place
as lou pours himself another adam starts to lose it again
guys were running out of ideas here
i mean we tried the scientist the tub what the fuck do we do next
lou downs another shot and gets a crazy look in his eye
i know what we do next
a delorean is parked in the empty lot
adam nick and jacob look at it drunkenly and bleary eyed
adam and nick trade swigs from a bottle of whiskey
the gull wing door opens and lou steps out in a foul mood
rental car agency fucked us
theres no flux capacitor
lou pulls jacob over and straps him in the drivers seat before walking around to the passenger side
to adam and nick well travel to
then one of us will come back and get one of you
and so on and so forth
lou sits in the passenger seat next to jacob
go light on the clutch
i dont wanna lose our deposit
jacob starts the car
adam and nick watch the car pull out of the parking lot
this will not end well
jacob and lou hit the road picking up speed
they pass a cop who pulls out turning on his lights and siren
oh shit they found me
i dont know how but they found me
i always wanted to say that
jacob hits the gas
lets see the look on this pigs face when we hit and disappear into thin air
the speedometer hits and then
the car shakes violently
this things a piece of shit
up ahead the road curves drastically
were doing a hundred
i cant control this car
i hear ya
the delorean brakes but doesnt make the turn
it flips over in a fantastic disaster and comes to a stop in a ditch
the cop pulls over gets out of his car and draws his gun
adam and nick watch the accident from a distance
so do you think we should run away
looking ragged as hell the four guys walk into the room and silently collapse on various beds and couches
i wonder if well still be here for our court appearance
if were still here in four months i will happily go to jail because ill be fucked anyway
a guy walks out of the bathroom wearing only a towel
he looks startled
who the hell are you dweebs
lou is up in a flash
he immediately decks the guy out cold and pummels him on the floor
the others pull him off
jesus christ what the hell lou
i have no tolerance for intruders
this is probably his room
were not registered here in
lou thinks for a moment and looks a little sorry
im still pretty ok with it
you have a problem
just help me put him outside
the guys open the door to the suite and find two dudes walking by
adam stops them
he partied pretty hearty
to the max
to the extreme max
so you guys wanna fuck with him or what
the dudes take custody of the passed out towel guy and continue on down the hall as our guys go back inside
the guys look physically exhausted
lets just go to sleep
well figure everything out in the morning
its pretty late
jacob checks his watch rolling his eyes
the other guys look at their watches surprised
why am i so wiped out
because youre old and lame
yeah fuck that were going to that party
we are not going to the party
hear me out
lou paces around the room like patton addressing the troops
we saw the scientist
he was worthless
we tried the tub
i got us a fucking time machine
it might as well have been a nissan
adam shakes his head as lou continues
gentlemen its fucking
nixons in the white house gas is free and were about to put a man on the moon
did we go to the same school
lou turns and addresses adam directly
the point is you havent even met your wife yet
she cant fault you for shit that went down years ago
even if years ago somehow ends up being tonight
adam starts listening a little more closely as some of lous logic actually makes some sense
its time to start facing the fact that we may not be going home
and if thats so then we owe it to ourselves to make the best life we can for ourselves
the guys listen intently as lous speech reaches a passionate climax
because i dont want to be that college freshman who spends the first semester hiding in his dorm room only to realize that come spring he has no friends
i want to be that college freshman who fucks chicks way out of his league before they have an opportunity to realize hes not as cool as hes pretending to
even jacob smiles
are you with me
i dont know
well talk some more at the party
its like the s exploded
music clothes hair attitude its all on overdrive
in one section party goers marvel at duck hunt while in another area people make out and dance
adam nick lou and jacob walk in the front door
they have updated their looks with s sweaters and other era appropriate attire
they all look ridiculous except for jacob whose youth lends him hipster appeal
this sweater makes me look like a jerkof f
its good to be home
in a corner phil puts his arm in a shark tank
just as the shark goes to bite he pulls his arm out unscathed
a small crowd claps
our guys are confused and upset
was this like an s thing
if he doesnt lose that arm soon im gonna take it from him myself
with that lou wanders off toward another room leering at and groping girls as he goes
hes gonna be a problem
tad and chaz walk over looking dapper and douchey
they are excited to see jacob
hey glad you could make it
this is your party
hey man no hard feelings all right
if your bro says youre cool then were cool
tad puts his arm around jacob and leads him into the party
theres some people i want you to meet
by the way bodacious hair
it doesnt really take that much product
its all in the layering
youre blowing my mind right now
did you spend time in europe
dont tell me
do you want some coke
do you have coke zero
ah a conscientious objector
i like that
gotta stay sharp
nick mixes something in a large bowl as plenty of eager party goers look on
he pours a red liquid into a tray of cups
an attractive party chick follows his every move
these will be ready in minutes
putting it together so its like jello
you get drunk while you enjoy a delicious gelatin snack
how come no one ever thought of this before
i just invented it
party chick looks into his eyes dreamily
i appreciate you
way too heartfelt i love you
lou plays an electric keyboard for about people
hes performing ace of bases the sign and singing passionately
adam walks up to where jacob aims a large video camera
he did a bunch of drugs and went on a rant about how much he resents ace of base
that bands from the s
he made me borrow tads video camera
he wants to document the performance and sue the band for infringement when we get back
adam sees tad and chaz behaving like cocks across the room making hot girls drink too much
re tad and chaz so you like these guys
theyre rich popular and they shower me with compliments
theyre pretty much the best friends ive ever had
a crowd gathers around phil who has removed the cover of a phil
like a zen master phil reaches out and grabs a fan blade stopping the fan without injury
nick holds up a homemade beer bong from which he drinks
he has his own crowd rooting him on
he finishes the last of the beer and the crowd celebrates
this guy should be in charge of everything
lou sits on a couch with michelle one of the girls we met earlier at the lodge
her friend sandy sits across from them next to jacob who looks uncomfortable
truth or dare
lou confers with michelle before answering
sandy and jacob confer figuring out the dare
lou meets jacobs eyes he smiles knowing jacob has his back
ok we dare lou to put a twizzler up his ass
lou stands up and angrily points at jacob
you son of a bitch
have you ever played this game before
its supposed to be awesome
lou nevertheless grabs a twizzler from the snack bowl and shoves it down the back of his pants
his face contorts uncomfortably and he is almost on the verge of tears
this is a horrible thing youre doing and i hope you never have to experience what i am currently going through
lou sits down and michelle consoles him
truth or dare
before sandy can even confer with jacob truth
lou throws up his hands in frustration
he looks miserable as michelle confers with him
grumbling to michelle i dont care
this is not the point of the game
ok each of you has to tell your darkest most personal secret
lou crosses his arms and shakes his head
oh wow all right
let me think
ive never told anyone this but i was afraid of scary movies until i was
i even ran out of the theater a couple of times
oh you poor thing
she takes jacobs head to her chest and strokes it gently
lou makes a jerk off gesture
im not sure i should tell mine
you have to
ok but you cant laugh
lets hear it
so this one time me and my friend lori took a train to baltimore
it was the summer and we wanted to party but we had no money
so lori found this businessman who was also looking for a good time and told him that wed give him a half and half for seventy five dollars
you know a suck and fuck
lou and jacob look shocked with the matter of fact storytelling
shes heard it before
anyway we get him up to his room and lori starts going down on him but i really wasnt into it
so i broke a piece of the bathroom mirror and used it to cut his artery on the heck
she rubs jacobs neck pointing it out
he bled for about an hour before he died
afterwards we took his wallet to the bar and found out he only had forty seven dollars
you said you wouldnt laugh
jacob and lou look shell shocked
adam sits in a chair in the corner secluded
to his left nicks in the kitchen catching popcorn in his mouth and earning accolades from all his new fans
to adams right the truth or dare game devolves as michelle pierces lous ear
he screams in pain but at the end he has a gold stud in his right ear
lou points at jacob
fuck you your turn
thats the gay ear you know
as adam looks straight ahead he sees jennie all by herself browsing the hosts cassette tape collection
adam takes a moment to check himself
then he reaches for his drink and gulps the whole thing before getting up and walking over to her catching her off guard
so i lied to you earlier
i wasnt here for a power tool convention
jennie instinctively looks around for her friends
you dont look like you could handle power tools
the truth is jennie ive always liked you
but ive never really known you
i really wasnt supposed to meet you again
who are you
adam shrugs indicating he might as well tell her
i came here from the future
she rolls her eyes shes heard all the one liners
let me guess
you want to beam me up to your spaceship built for two
or maybe youre wondering if these are astronaut pants
because my ass is out of this world
give me a break spaz
ive heard them all
she turns away
adam goes after her
no astronaut pants
just regular time travel
with normal pants
ok whats the punch line
an arm comes from behind and chokes adam
i thought i told you to stay off my mountain partner
you talking to my girl
i cant hear you
adam fights to breathe as blaine chokes him harder
blaine thats enough
let him go
he cant breathe
blaine doesnt stop
he smiles like an asshole
is that right
can you breathe partner
i cant hear you
just tell me you cant breathe and ill stop
adam still struggles
blaine just shrugs
hes not saying anything
i guess he can breathe
jennie pulls on blaines arm trying to free adam
blaine turns and accidentally elbows jennie in the face
she goes down
he releases adam and turns to help her
baby im sorry
turns to adam see what you made me do
screw you blaine
jennie gets up
she grabs adams arm and yanks him along with her as she storms away
come on lets go
blaine looks on fire as he watches jennie leave with adam
sandy i dont know what you did with this wine but it is delightful
jacob and lou sit with michelle and sandy back at the girls apartment
the whole place looks like a madonna concert
jacob looks uncomfortable but lou pours on the polite charm
its from a box
do you mind if i borrow my friend
well only be a moment
lou has jacob pinned against the wall with his arm
he speaks quietly but with purpose
youre gonna fuck her
im not gonna have sex with her
she killed a guy
that guy was undesirable
you heard her
it was about the money
great so shes a prostitute
im not sleeping with a hooker either
shes not a hooker
shes a girl who did what she had to do to make a few bucks
tries new tactic listen shes probably awesome in bed
she probably has a hairy vagina
jacob looks confused
im not having this conversation
i dont have a condom
no one here uses condoms
its like heaven
only with a lot more coke
lou takes his coke out of his pocket and snorts a bunch
how do i look
like a fucking madman
he slaps jacobs arms
rock and roll
lou exits the bathroom and calls out to the girls
whos ready to get laid by an awesome penis
adam and jennie are sitting on the floor by the fireplace playing monopoly
oooh atlantic avenue
thats gonna cost you
ill tell ya what
adam moves her token up a few squares and makes a show of looking over his shoulder as if someone might see
im not supposed to do this
but im gonna upgrade you to marvin gardens
its a suite
plus theres an excellent buffet and a view of the pool
jennie laughs despite herself
she looks around as if someone might see her
no ones gonna see you hanging out with the creepy spaz
im sorry i called you those names
hey its cool
i was being creepy and spazzy
youre still not gonna tell me how you know me
im from the future
fine lets just drop it
im glad youre feeling better
blaine had no right to hit you
i bet hes going out of his mind right now
what are you doing with a douche like him anyway
youre so much better than that
yeah well guys like you come to visit
guys like him live here
so if i lived here id have a shot
for a moment jennie is thrown off
shes about to say something but checks herself
instead she nervously stands
im gonna get going
adam stands up with her
thanks for being a good guy
i dont remember the last time i had this much fun playing such a stupid game
she gives adam a sweet kiss on the cheek
if you run into blaine you can tell him i blew you
but thats all
we didnt do anything else
we didnt do anything
its our little secret
jennie exits leaving adam confused
in the darkness we hear sounds of sex
moans of pleasure creaks of mattresses multiple yesses
on twin beds that are a little too close to each other lou and jacob have sex with michelle and sandy
the girls and lou are vocal
jacob is silent
as sandy rides him jacob notices some broken glass on the bedside table
he cant take his eyes off it as sandys hand keeps brushing up against the table
lou naked drinks a can of tab while he delivers the goods to michelle
he reaches over mid act and hands the half empty can to jacob
stop talking to me
despite the fact that this looks like very good sex it is very bad sex for jacob
adam is asleep in bed as jennie quietly enters the room
he wakes up to find her wearing sexy lingerie as she climbs on top of him
he looks over and sees nick snoring in the other bed
what are you doing here
jennie gives adam a long wet kiss
hes freaked out
i thought about what you said and youre right
i should be with you
i didnt necessarily say that
i want you adam
she rips open her lingerie revealing her awesome heaving oh my god
she kisses him again and they start to go at it
just then what the hell is going on here
adam pushes jennie off him as the lights go on in the room
lily is standing in the doorway looking sad and angry
so you do like her better than me
no she just adam looks to where jennie just was but now the bed is covered with photos of jennie
theres also a large box of tissues and some hand lotion
whats all this
whats wrong with my vagina adam
nothings wrong with it
in the next bed nick rolls over and wakes up
its a beautiful vagina
among the prettiest ive ever seen
stay out of it nick
would it be so bad to spend the rest of your life with my vagina
it wouldnt at all
lily turns and walks out the door
lily it wouldnt
i love your vagina
i love your vaginaaaaaa
adam abruptly wakes up
he sees nick sitting on a bed on the other side of the room
hes on the phone talking quietly with someone
i just really need to get a few things off my chest
youre domineering and you think you have all the answers but you dont
not by a long shot
nick is getting emotional
you think youre better than me
last night i made jello shots and everybody loved me
they didnt care that i only brought home k last year
they loved me for me
they didnt go throwing their rich parents weight around
wipes away a tear i dont know courtney
a year old courtney nicks future wife listens to this crying man on the other end of the phone
nick cries a little bit harder
its so good to hear your voice
i love you princess
i really do
you just make it so hard on me sometimes
i just want it to be ok
adam starts registering some of this conversation
who are you talking to
nick looks at adam and covers the receiver
what do you mean courtney
adam picks up another phone
adam freaked out hangs up his phone
get off the phone
but nick is down the rabbit hole
baby i gotta go
just think about what i said
were so great together
its like when were having sex the way our bodies become one as we both embrace the passion of the moment on the other end courtneys dad has picked up
nick hangs up the phone and stares at it freaked out
adam just shakes his head
ok so that may have been bad
what were you thinking
the door opens and lou strolls in looking quite fresh
guess who re popped his s cherry
he points at himself in a celebratory manner as behind him the towel guy whose room this is comes running up
hey get the hell out of my room
in one move lou catches him inside the room closes the door with his foot and puts the guy in a head lock
he then converts it into a sleeper hold putting the guy to sleep
oh were going to jail
help me put him in the closet
the guys drop the sleeping towel guy in the closet
adam nick and lou take a soak in the tub
has anyone seen jacob
hes grabbing drinks with tad and chaz
which is what we should do
well start at the brew haus and do a three drink crawl up the street adam gets more fed up than ever
i refuse to accept that were stuck in
maybe youre loving it lou
but you dont get it
nicks insane jacobs become a bigger douche than before and i need to get back for my goddamn rehearsal dinner
which is tomorrow
i know i dont look like i understand but i do
you have a beautiful fiancee who means more to you than anything in the world
and if you could youd literally travel across time for her
i get it man
life is about these moments
moments where a regular joe becomes a hero
moments where you dig deep and find the motivation
the guts to do whats right and whats necessary
its moments like these
lou suddenly notices some cocaine on the edge of the tub
jesus how come nobody told me there was coke out here
lou snorts a big line
what was i saying
adam and nick get out and towel off
maybe we have to learn something
what do you mean
you know like groundhog day
we have to learn the meaning of life or some shit
just then a kitten licking a puddle on the base of the tub jumps in the hot tub and vanishes in a bright light
for a moment everyone is quiet
ive gotta stop doing cocaine and i need to go to the hospital
i just saw a fucking kitten explode
i saw it too
the guys run over to the tub
the bubbles are on low but theres nothing in it
it didnt explode
it went back
to the present
this is the present
our old present
so it is the tub
lou points at something
the hot tub is not plugged in and yet its clearly running
you guys know what to do
the guys have a couple boxes of kittens
one at a time they get in the tub and take turns dipping the kittens
when nothing happens lou dumps an entire box of kittens into the tub
the cats get angry and claw at his face and body
eventually the guys just shake their heads
this isnt working
maybe these arent the right kittens
adam points at him in a now youre thinking way
well split up
get as many different cats as you can
lets all meet back here in an hour
you can count on me
lou sits on a stool munching on snacks
a tv shows the afc conference championship game between the denver broncos and the cleveland browns
its the th quarter and the browns score with remaining on the clock to go up by
two stools over a slick haired asshole rick sits with his bored looking high society trophy wife candace
hate to tell ya pal
browns are gonna lose by in overtime
eat shit and die scumbag
ive got ten large on this game
not only that but i bet you elways gonna throw a touchdown with seconds left
fat chance pal
elways done nothing all day
care to make it interesting
who the hell are you
lou thinks about the question for a moment
ive got a cool name huh
its a good name
what did you have in mind musselman
i win your wife gives me a blowjob
a classy one
for the first time candace looks less than bored
she does a bad job of feigning disinterest
all right buddy fuck off
you win you can kill me
any way you want
knife gun torch sword
ill even make a video exonerating you
you look like a man who has everything
except the license to kill
care to gamble
rick looks at lou long and hard
lou doesnt flinch
you have a deal
as rick and lou shake hands candace makes a show of looking offended
dont worry babe
this yahoos made a wager he cant possibly win
lou picks up another handful of bar snacks
he puts them in his mouth and shows it to rick
who am i
im your wife
nuts in my mouth
i like it slow and romantic
nick leaves a pet store carrying a box of kittens
on the street he accidentally bumps into one of the japanese businessmen from the night before
he has a thick accent like gedde watanabe in gung ho
oh sorry man
hows that ipod working out for you
oh its a very nice toy
if you like that ive got a phone back at the lodge that will knock your socks off
i wish i could see it
but i am on my way to a very important business meeting
more important than bluetooth
my associates and i are co financing a
how do you say it
youre not going to boston by any chance
we leave tonight
youre gonna franchise out the gelmans mom and pop
how do you know this
nick puts his arm around the guy and walks down the street
walk with me a minute
let me tell you about some companies you should really be looking into
tad chaz and jacob enjoy drinks on a deck overlooking the mountain ski slopes
you really are a gas jacob
tad and i think youre the cats pajamas
i like you guys too
a third douchebag arrives and gives a secret handshake to tad and chaz
he drops off a pill bottle
this is geoffrey pronounced joff rey
geoffrey please meet jacob
excuse his jewish name
he really quite exceeds it
jacob looks confused by that as geoffrey shakes his hand
jacob would you like some too
he offers a pill bottle
what is it
geoffreys father is a pharmacist but we dont hold that against him
you slip it to a chick who wont go to third
give it an hour and youll be rounding home
this is a date rape drug
what the fuck is date rape
these are roofies
i like that
yeah it takes the clinical name right out of it
it sounds so fresh chicks might even take it voluntarily
hey can we use that
jacob looks beside himself
a guy and a girl are using the hot tub which is still hot and bubbly despite the fact that it isnt plugged in
nick and lou sit at the table as adam approaches with cats
i got regular cats
i figured maybe the kitten was a fluke
nick takes the box out of his hands and puts it down
he leads adam near the tub where lou points at something
what am i looking at
its some kind of stain
im not smelling it
smell the stain
adam puts his nose up against the stain and sniffs
he recognizes something but cant put his finger on it
what is that
hey you fellas mind
im trying to get a handjob here
our guys sit and absorb the impact of what theyve learned
so youre telling me that red bull plus hot tub equals time travel
hank musselmans getting the nobel prize
who the fuck is hank musselman
there was just enough red bull for the kitten
not nearly enough for a human
its a weight distribution thing
how did you even figure this out
he bet me dollars i wouldnt lick the stain
i thought it was some guys jizz
whats wrong with you
it worked didnt it
yeah except one little problem
theres no red bull in
for a moment theyre all bummed again
then adam gets an encouraged look on his face
yes there is
adam heads for the door as lou and nick follow
jennie instructs a group of teenagers on the basics of skiing as adam approaches with nick and lou in tow
you cant be here
if blaine sees you hell snap your neck
i told him i blew you and hes not happy
why would you do that
behind adam nick looks at the group of teens and his eyes almost bug out
he elbows lou
whispers teeth clenched look
lou looks to where nick is looking young adam young nick and young lou wait with other kids for jennie to return to their lesson
lou immediately approaches the kids even as nick tries to hold him back
where the fuck are you going
lou walks right up to his younger self and looks himself square in the face
what the hell do you want old man
lou punches his younger self in the face
young nick and young adam are freaked out as is regular nick
adam doesnt notice as hes arguing with jennie
what the fuck dude
i think you broke my nose
my parents are gonna sue the shit out of you
herschel and evelyn arent gonna do a damn thing
how do you know my parents
listen to me
start putting minoxidil on your scalp
then when propecia comes on the market start taking it
hair is important
i dont give a shit about hair
leans in quietly or ill tell everyone about how you jerked off to that issue of playgirl
it was confusing
there were naked people and it had girl in the title
hey you dont have to justify to me pal
who are you
you wanna see blaine
its your funeral
hes in the warehouse at the end of lawrence
adam walks off the mountain with nick and lou
moment of truth
lou takes off his hat and feels his scalp no hair
just then lous nose slightly shifts the result of being broken and never fixed
it stays this wa for the rest of the movie
lou touches his nose
oh thats just great
jacob runs up in a friendlier disposition
i thought you were with douche patrol
yeah i was
but it turned out those guys are date rapists
adam where are we going
adam gets a look of determination again
to get my bag
we get that we have the red bull and our ticket home
the race is on
were at a ski resort
disputes like these are settled with a downhill ski race
usually at dawn
its the law
youre an idiot
adam and the guys step into a warehouse
wet floor chains hanging from the ceiling for no reason steam rising from grates
as they enter chaz pulls down a large garage door
up ahead blaine sits on some crates with tad
welcome to my lair
you live here
yeah this is kind of a shitty place to live
i dont live here
adam approaches blaine trying to speak maturely
i think we got off on the wrong foot
you have some issue with me
you get blown by my girl
ill say thats one hell of an issue
you got blown
she didnt blow me
she lied to you to make you jealous
im not trying to steal jennie
i just wanna get my bag
oh your bag
i was wondering when youd come around for that
tad holds up the backpack over by the crates
yeah ill just take it and get out of your way
adam extends his hand
can we work this out like gentlemen
blaine pulls a knife
tad and chaz also pull knives
what is this towns obsession with knives
how about i work this out like
just then light spills into the dark warehouse
a guy in a polo shirt stands in a dooorway
back to work
like naughty children being caught red handed blaine and his goons lose the knives and hustle toward the open door
blaine grabs the backpack from tad
adam and the guys follow through the door and into adam nick lou and jacob are confused as blaine chaz and tad spring to action helping customers choose sunglasses
jacob approaches tad and chaz who look embarrassed
you guys are posers
youre not better than me
jacob i wish you hadnt seen us like this
adam stands near blaine who helps a woman
these would look so good with your light complexion
i want my bag
will you excuse me for a moment
blaine walks behind the counter and shoves the bag in a safe
safes on a timer
itll open tomorrow
we race at dawn
winner gets the bag
loser leaves town
lou turns to nick
i told you
i dont wanna race you
then i guess you dont want your bag
see you at dawn
your girlfriend sucks one hell of a mean dick
adam makes a slurping sound and blaine fumes
nick lou and jacob walk behind adam who looks pissed
what are we gonna do
that chick blew you
ive got a race to win
europes the final countdown begins playing over a montage skis are sharpened
gear is polished
in the suite adam gets dressed in his gear
on a small hill jacob demonstrates some moves on skis
adam doesnt get it
hes keeps falling
on the hill jacob teaches adam how to snowboard
adam is having an easier time standing up on the snowboard
the guys keep adam awake and use a homemade scale model of the mountain to formulate a plan a la iron eagle
back on the hill jacob and adam snowboard next to each other
adam makes it by a couple of obstacles
jacob looks proud of him
the guys play an atari ski game trying out a strategy
jacob uses a pointer looking disappointed
on the hill adam easily maneuvers by a few trees on the snowboard kicking up snow and high fining jacob
slo mo hero shot of our four guys as they ascend the top of the mountain
if we didnt know any better it would look like tony scott directed a ski movie
a few yards away from nick and lou adam sits on the ground as jacob helps him strap into the snowboard
just stick to the plan and youre gonna be fine
adam looks at jacob seriously for a moment
jacob im sorry for not always being the big brother i shouldve been
i was away at college mom gave you my sega there were a whole host of issues
jacob nods and speaks genuinely to adam too
im sorry too
i put a few things before my family and took my guilt out on you
puts it together i guess it was an inevitable id end up part of a roofie ring
adam smiles and extends his hand
jacob takes adams hand and helps him to his feet
lou looks disgusted
blaine and his goons approach from below
adam puts on his game face
i didnt think you guys would show
this was my idea
its gonna make my victory taste all the more sweeter
like a peach snapple
blaine actually looks rattled as the two men get lined up
adam is on a snowboard
youre not afraid of getting beat by a guy on a skateboard are you
ive seen you in action
youre reckless and terrible
reckless and terribles my middle name
because i feel the need
pulls on goggles for speed
chaz holds out his arm as a starting line
catch ya at the bottom
blaine takes off down the mountain like a professional skiier which he pretty much is
adam looks toward jacob who demonstrates the proper crouch
adam slowly picks up speed starting at about one mile per hour
blaine looks back and cant believe how easily hes gonna coast to victory
here goes nothing
instead of weaving back and forth adam just stays in the crouch picking up speed
he recklessly passes blaine despite the many trees and obstacles on the course
he bears down and travels like a bolt of lightning
blaine finds the guts to alter his style skiing more recklessly too
he begins catching up to adam
blaine skis up next to adam theyre both going full force
you cant beat me
i was born on this mountain
i was born in a hospital like a normal baby
adam bends down and picks up even more speed narrowly missing trees and rocks
blaine tries to keep up
adam has the finish line in his sights when he rolls the dice once too often
his snowboard gets snagged on a rock and adam tumbles to the ground
the snowboard flies off into the air
phil stands against a shed as a guy throws a hatchet at him just narrowly missing his arm
phil flexes his muscles as a then the snowboard flies into frame and slices off phils arm sending blood splatter everywhere
lou watches with binoculars and pumps his fist
as adam tumbles on the ground blaine smiles thinking he has the victory in the bag
but instead of stopping adam picks up speed as he tumbles limb over limb like a snowball going down the mountain
with yards to go blaine bears down and tries to catch adam
its gonna be close
at the finish line adams crumpled body passes the line first
blaine pulls up pissed off to lose the race
adams momentum carries him forward another yards where he smashes into a deck and finally comes to a stop
a large bon voyage banner hangs in the room
an all out party is going on in the guys suite
guests party everywhere helping the guys celebrate
sandy and michelle flirt with the two dudes who took brief possession of the towel guy yesterday
the coke guy from the gondola talks with the brew haus waitress
adams leg is in a cast as he sits at a table with jacob nick and lou
the open backpack is in front of them
they drink and toast
you did it man
ah it was nothing
i just fell down the mountain
it was a beautiful fall
lou goes into adams backpack and pulls out the sandwich which he begins unwrapping
tell me you are not going to keep eating that
lou takes a bite and shrugs
its my favorite
adam takes the sandwich from lou
he looks at it closely
on this roll
the guys look confused as adam stares at the sandwich
adam what is it
adam and lily nervously make eye contact at the front of the restaurant as a snooty host shakes his head
it was our first date
you know those nights that are just perfect
this wasnt one of those nights
adam and lily sit through from justin to kelly the american idol movie
they dont enjoy themselves
adam inspects a huge dent in the side of his car
as he does so a car drives by splashing a puddle on lily
if lily knew where we were im sure she wouldve walked home
and i wouldnt have blamed her
in the rain adam and lily run toward the entrance of a little deli
inside the doorway a little old woman shakes her head no
adam pleads with his eyes and she lets them in
adam and lily sit and talk animatedly at the counter in the small empty deli eating sandwiches
we were so hungry by the time we found that deli we wouldve eaten anything
so what if it wasnt foie gras and pino noir
it was chicken parm and italian soda
and it couldnt have been more perfect
the guys enjoy listening to adams story
that sandwich was special huh
you could say that
you could also say it gave me horrible diarrhea
adam shits his brains out
when it looks like
he might be done he turns around and vomits into the toilet
lily waits by the bathroom door with some pepto and a glass of water
she looks very concerned
lily had every opportunity to leave
she didnt know me at all and she certainly didnt owe me anything after the night i put her through
but she stayed
adam lays on the couch his head in lilys lap
she feeds him a little gatorade
he keeps it down
for a moment
then he turns and vomits into a bucket on the floor
she saw me at my worst and she stayed
lily holds the bucket as adam pukes into it
nick lou and jacob look sick
dont you see
this is more than a sandwich
it represents all that shit
all that puke
keep the sandwich
this is disgusting
she gave me this as a reminder of her love
or to give me horrible diarrhea so i didnt leave the room during the bachelor party
but mostly as a reminder of her love
adam holds up the sandwich
this is the reason i need to go home
adam stands up and walks toward the door with the sandwich
im gonna go prep the tub
lou holds up a bag of chips
do you have any stories about these chips or can i eat them
adam walks outside taking a bite of the sandwich
he finds jennie waiting in the tub
there you are
what are you doing here
making good on a rumor
jennie stands up in the tub and shes topless
adam drops the sandwich shocked
jennie continues talking shamelessly exposing herself
when i saw you win that race against blaine everything changed for me
i realize now that i deserve more
i deserve a winner
come and get your prize
adam reaches next to the tub and hands her a robe
she covers up embarrassed
oh my god
i missed my opportunity
no im not sure there ever was an opportunity
jennie youre terrific
youve brought me so many moments of joy youll never know
but i shouldnt have given you the wrong idea
jennie looks sad and vulnerable as adam talks
the truth is theres a girl i need to go see
we have plans to spend the rest of our lives together
and i cant wait any longer
listening to himself and im totally cool with it
adam smiles feeling the rush of knowing hes ready
but then he sees how sad jennie is
he moves closer to her
one day youre going to find the right guy whos willing to give up everything and travel across time and space for your love
she nods and tears up a little bit as adam hugs her
i would totally blow you right now
i know you would
the guys stare at the tub which continues to bubble even though its not plugged in
we dont have to go yet adam
things are just getting fun
and we can do whatever we want without any real consequences
thats a lot to give up
thats how i know im doing the right thing
adam reaches in his backpack but cant find the red bull
he turns it inside out and shakes it nothing
wheres the red bull
you looking for this
across the patio a drunk disheveled blaine holds the can
you couldnt leave well enough alone could ya
you couldnt just win the race and call it a day
you had to have jennie too
i dont want jennie
i dont want this soda either
blaine smiles like an asshole
adams face goes desperate as blaine opens the can and drinks the whole thing
adam runs at blaine and tackles him to the ground
on the ground adam beats the living hell out of blaine messing up his face
it makes the jared leto scene from fight club look tame
eventually adams friends pull him off
adam crawls to the red bull can and its empty
lou takes blaines pulse
you may have killed this guy
ive got a pulse
eh so much for that
nick puts his hand on adams shoulder
im sorry man
im really sorry
the red bulls gone
he fucked us
everyone looks toward jacob
the red bull isnt really gone
points to blaine its in him
a beat as everyone sorta gets it
its worth a shot
adam nick and jacob sit in the tub
adam crosses his fingers
lou stands outside the tub fully dressed
come on lou
nah ill take a rain check
what are you talking about
listen your lives at home sound all beautiful and happy with your barbecues and swimming pools and oh that sandwich reminds of some gay shit i did one time
adam and nick dont look thrilled to be reduced to this
but my life back there sucks
and in case you havent noticed my life here fucking rules
so i have a coke problem
ill go to rehab
i have no money
ill stop winning sex and start winning dollars
lou drags blaine by the foot closer to the tub
guys i was tailor made for
and youll excuse me but i value banging young chicks way more than all of your friendships combined
adam nick and jacob kinda nod and understand
yeah no i get it
lou goes around and gives them all hugs
makes perfect sense man
lou squeezes jacobs shoulder
i dont hate you as much as i used to
a little emotional i hate you a little less also
lou lifts blaines limp body
ok whenever youre ready lou
one small step for man
one giant asshole puking in a hot tub
here goes nothing
lou does the heimlich maneuver on blaine
it takes one
three thrusts until blaine pukes in the tub
for a second its just a big splash of vomit and nothing else
ok well maybe if we a bright flash consumes the screen
and when it dies down we see adam nick jacob and the floating puke in the hot tub where we left them
only lou is missing
did it work
i didnt feel anything
they see people walking by wearing colorful flared out ski attire
the place looks the same as it did two seconds ago
even the deck furnitures the same
we fucking blew it
it didnt work
right on schedule
lou walks toward them but theres a lot thats off about him including hair plugs jewelry and a shitload of plastic surgery including a fixed nose that makes him look
at once older and younger
oh the face eh
i was curious how youd react
didnt think youd be scared
youre damn right its me
you just traveled years in three seconds
took me years
its good to see you guys
it all looks the same
you know how much i pay the groundspeople around here
but thats all right im fucking loaded
look at all this
everyone looks confused
will you fill in some of the blanks for me please
ill give you the short version because time is of the essence
first of all to settle an old bet time most definitely has been moving forward
it is exactly three days since youve arrived here in beautiful havenhurst
jacob looks at nick
secondly im filthy rich
made sports bets
sued ace of base
i own most of v ermont
ive been reimagining the state as my own personal playground
you could say im a little bit like michael jackson except i dont fuck kids
two young hotties walk by and wave at lou
i do fuck them though
havent gone above years old in years and even then it was a mistake
a horrible mistake
wait fuck lou what time is it
way ahead of you adam
you have hours to get to new jersey in time for your rehearsal dinner
great i blew it
not even a little bit
i have a helicopter waiting in the parking lot and a private jet on my airfield five minutes away
the guys look stunned
i had some time to plan
god its good to have you guys back
lous private jet takes off from the runway
the guys sit back and enjoy the plush surroundings and the beautiful flight attendants aboard lous jet
by the way adam i hope you dont mind
right after you left i fucked jennie silly
why would she have sex with you
you get the big time assist
all that talk of her finding the right guy whos willing to give up everything
made her wetter than a log flume
shes all time top five
good to hear
lou i gotta ask you something
time travel paradox
arent there now two of you living here in
think really hard about that one
what happened to me when i was
he looks at adam
suddenly both their eyes nearly pop out of their skulls
you went missing and were never found
yeah youre gonna have some lingering memories of both versions
wait a minute what happened to
you dont wanna know
the kid sucked ok
he couldnt take even a little bit of direction
pretty soon i realized that having two versions of the same dude walking around as cool as that sounds didnt make very much sense to me
so i took care of the problem
what did you do
i had to do it
what did you do
i killed myself
yeah it was really some existential shit
i mean here i am committing homicide and im actually committing suicide
how could you
it was easy actually
for a minute i thought i might be dealing with that whole timecop thing
you know the same matter cant occupy the same space at the same time bullshit and we both go poof
especially after that whole nose thing
but no it was just a murder
i didnt suffer
i dont wanna hear any more
it was strangulation
i dont wanna hear any more
they sit in horrified silence for a bit
youll have to introduce me when we get there
your families wont know me
although im sure theyre huge fans
so hey getting married huh
taking the plunge
adam looks disturbed
nick looks confused
this makes no sense at all
lily looks beautiful surrounded by family and friends
still she looks distant and lonely
until a lily the flower comes into frame
lily smiles and stands up
she turns around
adams standing there with a whole bouquet of flowers
lily gives him a big hug and kiss
when shes done dont you ever let me take your phone again
im here on time
just like i promised
nick sits down next to courtney and jacob takes his seat
no nerves at all im so happy to see you and i cant wait to spend the rest of my life with you
youre the one
lily notices adams on crutches
oh my god what happened
my fault entirely madam
the room is abuzz with chatter as lou makes a nearly regal entrance wearing a white tuxedo
hey its lou blustein
the whole room applauds lou as he walks in
adam and the guys cant believe it
i was partaking in a little ski adventure and i mistakenly wandered into your fiances path
his broken leg is my broken heart
my most humble apologies
lou scrapes and bows and regally kisses lilys hand
she looks genuinely flattered
lou gets up and whispers to adam
im awesome here
you shoulda stayed out of that tub
nick slow dances with courtney
i was thinking wed invite adam and lily over for dinner when they get back from their honeymoon
if its ok with you
why wouldnt it be ok with me
that sounds nice
you look so good in this shirt by the way
she puts her head on nicks shoulder as they dance
how are your parents
still working hard
i really wish they could retire already but its tough competing with the big chains
i mean they just have the one store
the japanese businessman is on a pay phone speaking rapidly in japanese
cancel the paperwork
we have to get back to tokyo
i have inside information that undermines the supermarket deal
nick stands next to him nodding and smiling widely
nick enjoys dancing with his mellow awesome wife
you know what they say about hard work
adam orders drinks as his phone rings
he picks it up and in an instant jacob is standing right before him as a very ahh
this is why we shouldnt have sold that ipod
adam puts his hand through jacob who speaks with purpose
the japanese have apparently cornered the technology sector over the past years
weve dealt american businesses quite an irreparable blow
what does that mean for us
pretty much nothing for us personally
we just get cooler phones and ipods and shit
jacob clicks off and disappears as lily approaches
adam cant help but beam from ear to ear
youre so beautiful
i know you were only gone for a couple days but i missed you so much
adam takes her hand
come on lets get out of here
we have unfinished business
she gets into it
its about time
ok whats the fantasy
how about youre the woman i love and im the man of your dreams
ok youre a nurse and a snake bit my penis
done and done
they bolt for the door and we the party is winding down and only a few guests remain
at a table in the corner lou has an extended make out session with a stunningly beautiful girl in her early s
they finally come up for air
so youre friends with the bride
can you keep a secret
im actually kinda crashing the party
youre secrets safe with me
im just in town for a couple of nights
im actually looking for my father
weve never met
im from here
maybe i know him
his name is hank musselman
for a moment lous expression freezes
then no never heard of him
