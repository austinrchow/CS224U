the camera is moving slowly down a long basement corridor
we hear a narrator werner on his th birthday i decided to tell julius benedict the truth about himself
hold on sign top secret authorized personnel only
it wasnt that he was the product of a scientific experiment
a white coated scientist professor werner is studying a bizarre piece of equipment that looks suspiciously like a milkshake blender
with him is another scientist this is traven already imperious already a prick
an experiment designed to produce a physically mentally and spiritually superior human being
i explained that to him when he was two years old
most of them young s and s
they are being given a medical examination by a group of doctors including werner
and it wasnt the complexity of juliuss parentage
he knew that unlike other little boys he didnt have just one but half a dozen fathers all very distinguished men
not your hollywood type
this is obviously a lady of character and talent
her name we will come to learn is mary ann benedict
she is on a hospital bed and being readied for surgery
nor was it about the extraordinary woman chosen to be his mother
traven emerges sadly shaking his head
werner tries to enter the room traven wont permit it
julius had long lived with the tragic news that she died giving birth to him
as a nurse parting the security guards emerges and holds up a plump serene smiling baby boy
what julius didnt know until this very moment was that about a minute after he was born
another nurse emerges from the delivery room holding up a second infant this one is screaming with rage
his mother gave birth to another baby
the serene baby
any mothers joy
the angry baby
pull back to reveal the two of them are in the same crib
the leg of the angry baby
it suddenly lashes out connects with the rump of the serene baby the serene baby
starting to cry
the angry baby
all smiles now
hold on the two babies in their crib as the following words fill the screen he looks up and stares dead at the camera stunned i have a brother
a greenhouse on the island
werner now is bent and old
julius in peasant garb is a marvelous looking human being
speaks with an austrian accent he was sent to an orphanage in los angeles
at the same time i brought you here to the island
julius isnt listening
his eyes shine
amazed i have a twin brother
for a moment chews on his right thumbnail whats his name
moved vincent every time i loved something i called it vincent i called my first computer vincent
suddenly spins starts off i have to find him
julius strides along a windswept path followed by werner
the ocean spread out below them is vast and empty
this island is far from anywhere
fretting terribly youve been here since you were a baby you know nothing of america i know it is the cradle of democracy and the land of the free besides
i speak twelve languages im sure i can get a job
theyre a simple people rather primitive not like us
my brother will look after me
its a blend of modern technology and the tropical environment floor to ceiling book cases computers a hammock shrouded in a mosquito net
julius is hurriedly packing a small leather suitcase watched by werner
werner hands over a photograph its a picture of a younger werner traven and the six fathers
its your only copy my need for it is only sentimental yours may be practical julius slips the photo into his suitcase
thank you ill miss you
holding back the tears ill miss you
they hug as we the waters edge
julius werner an older lady two scientists and an oriental man are all saying goodbye
julius puts his suitcase into a small rowboat
as julius hugs her its sixty miles to the airport julius be careful
julius then bows to the oriental who bows back
in japanese subtitled it was an honor to study under you master
without warning the oriental tries to strike julius in the face with the side of his hand but julius blocks the blow
in english ahhh always on guard
you have learned well julius san
julius gives a last hug to werner
to werner i was just thinking maybe my brother vincent is married
well if a woman loved my brother enough to marry him she might have a sister whod feel the same way about me
that often happens with twins you know
julius please dont get your hopes up
your brother doesnt even know you exist
julius gets in the boat and casts off
the boat takes off like a streak
julius in perfect rhythm increases the pace
the boat is almost flying across the water
loudly as he disappears in the horizon of course he does
ive always known there was something missing in my life
and deep down im sure vincent feels the same way
hes probably just like meeeee
vince benedict lies in bed looking extremely pleased with himself
a sexy young woman is nestled asleep against him
the digital bedside alarm purrs and starts to play music something romantic that vince hums along to
you sleep well honey
like a baby
i love this new mattress
its soft but its hard at the same time
and i love this new clock
carla snuggles against vince as he surveys the bedroom like a house proud new owner
youve done a great job on this room carla
you really think so
even the curtains
the curtains are the key to the whole thing
melting you were great last night vince
not disagreeing naaaw
putting his arm around her i think were going to be very happy here
suddenly we hear a door downstairs as it opens and a mans voice drifts up the stairs twins rev
a bit surprised but not panicked whats he doing back so early
vince jumps out of bed starts pulling on his clothes while carla slips into a bathrobe
you gonna cook me some breakfast or what
be right down sweetheart
vince checks his appearance in a dresser mirror straightens his armani suit brushes his hair pulls it into a fashionable ponytail
he cuts a stylish figure
noticing an expensive gold lighter on the dresser top he covertly pockets it
carla pushes him towards the open french doors
i gotta make breakfast
youre wonderful carla
your husband doesnt deserve to kiss your feet
vince steps out and jauntily climbs over the rail
its very clear he likes the danger being on the edge
in another life he was probably errol flynn
now he gives carla an errol flynn smile and with that he leaps into space
as vince gracefully lands bounces off it onto the ground
he bends picks up a flower puts it in the outside pocket of his armani suit heads toward a new mustang parked not far away
as vince gets in starting to sing
hes got a good voice oh what a beautiful morning oh what a beautiful day
now he does something surprising not starting to drive we expect that
what we dont expect is his destination because what he does is simply turn the nearest corner and drive right back to the house he just snuck out of
exiting the car still singing everythings going my way
where carla in her robe is working away starting to make breakfast
vince enters gives her the sweetest smile
carla what a joy to look at you
as she gives him a look is my partner and best friend al home from work yet
i am the bringer of good tidings
the kitchen door opens and al greco enters
he is sing ing happy birthday and carries a wrapped gift held out in front of him
hes dressed in overalls with an insignia on his breast pocket that reads airport stop with that horrible song you know how i hate birthdays theyre worse than christmas
al presents him with the gift
coy for me
carla and i figured since you were always admiring mine what the hell
vince struggles to contain his delight at this irony
a lighter just like yours
i dont know what to say al
im all choked up
the phone rings and carla picks it up
into phone hello the greco residence
who may i say is calling
vince its for you vince confidently picks up the receiver
into phone good morning mr
i hope youre having a wonderful cut off yes no problem i have it
vince hangs up
what are you doing talking to a loanshark
excited thats part of my good news you know that money i picked up from the jaguar we boosted
well i put the money in the stock market
i got this incredible tip
i cant lose
ever hear of p
probably not secret takeover bid twins rev
you put the money on a stock
a very special stock and it was such a sure thing i borrowed another grand from the klane brothers
unbelieving you borrowed from a loan shark to invest in the stock market
on margin and as of last night i was ten thousand ahead
im going to make a fortune turn on the t
cable news stock report
that wall streets suffering its worst single days losses since october
hardest hit were federated broadcasting down waverton data down and p
analysts speculate that even blue chip stocks will not remain immune to
closeup on the extremely worried face of vince as he takes in the bad news
you are having one shitty birthday vince
im wiped out
i got to get some money fast
came in for long term last night
dont you think youre doing this too often
im a desperate man
thru thru closeup on a large painted number then pan down to reveal a new bmw
vincent approaches the bmw and pretends to be searching for his keys while he waits for another car to pull out and drive away
the second its gone vince deftly opens the bmw door with a slim jim
he gets behind the wheel hot wires the ignition and drives away
vince is a pro
the green bmw is already being repainted by some men wearing goggles and using spray guns
vince comes out of an office counting a wad of bills followed by the owner of the chop shop
this is only four thousand were in a recession everythings tough you want to try someone else no hard feelings
sourly forget it
you okay vince
you seem a little worried
i laugh myself to sleep every night and i never sleep alone
im doing great
the owner smiles and turns
vince continues counting the money nervous as hell
now twins rev
flying through clear blue skies
coming down the aisle checking the passengers as we hear singing put on your red dress baby cause were going out tonight
a few passengers turn and look back at seated in the rear still in his peasant garb the bamboo suitcase resting on his lap
he has his headphones on and is singing along to the music his eyes closed and his head bobbing
singing i better wear some boxing gloves in case some fool might want to fight
the stewardess removes his headphones and considers julius with amusement
i knew you were trouble the second i laid eyes on you
julius stares up at her speechless and mesmerized
realizing sorry ive never heard this music before i love it
she sighs leans over him fastens his seat belt while julius gazes down at her ample cleavage
the captain wants us to buckle our seat belts because were expecting a little turbulence
reading her name tag thank you betty lou
i bet youre a football player
actually im a horticultural botanist a mathematician and a philosopher
and im a brain surgeon
as the stewardess heads back up the aisle a man jumps up grabs her around the neck with one arm and brandishes a gun in his other hand
to passengers nobody moves or else were gonna have a serious draft in here
turns to another stewardess get the captain
i want to discuss our final destination
he continues maneuvering the stewardess up the aisle
his back is totally to julius now
turns to the terrified elderly woman beside him whos clutching a hardcover bible in her lap
whispers excuse me maam
as he takes the book from her quickly draws back his arm the gun at the panicked stewardesss head he continues slowly up the aisle shouting for everyone to freeze
not even to think about moving now a hardcover book comes rocketing through the air hits him in the back of the neck and he goes limp fall ing across some seats the gun dropping from his hand
grabbing him all of them brave and heroic a lot of commotion shouts of ive got him dont move etc
retrieving the hardcover bible from the floor and as julius smiles reassuringly returns her bible to her sits back in his seat
gently calming her his mischief shall return upon his own hand and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own head psalm
in front now there is a lot of activity as various pass engers hold the highjacker almost arguing over whos in control
julius looks at them a moment puts on his headset closes his eyes and is soon bopping away to the music
as the plane circles to land
julius exits the terminal surrounded by orientals
he makes his way to an airport shuttle bus
as vince sidles into a booth watched by a bartender who clearly dislikes him
a pretty young cocktail waitress called marnie turns and stares daggers at vince
marnie is a fireball of a girl all brass and sass on the outside and sweet as cotton candy on the inside sort of a jean harlow valley girl
she approaches vince who greets her with effusive warmth
how are you
is your sister around
marnie pointedly scoops up the tip left by the previous occupants of the booth
marnie starts to wipe down the table spilling crumbs into his lap
you total lindas car
you pawn her stereo
you declare us as dependents on your tax return
what an amazing memory vince
i knew youd come back
marnies sister linda also a cocktail waitress slips into the booth and gives vince a big kiss
linda although just as attractive as her younger sister has a completely different personality shes trusting dependent and legally blind when it comes to vincent
to linda i am so sorry for all the miserable things ive done to you
to marnie im not going to give him any money
just take care of my station for a minute
marnie exchanges an exasperated glance with the bartender and walks away
linda distances herself a little from vince in the booth not meeting his eyes
emotionally i didnt come here for a loan sweetheart
i came to say goodbye
beat its not safe for me here
people are trying to kill me
vince starts to rise but linda pulls him back down
what did you do vince
i got involved in the stock market
getting nervous i promised marnie i wouldnt give you money
vince takes lindas hand between his and stares into her eyes
dont look at me like that
dont do that with your eyes
i shouldnt even be here with you
softly you are here and so am i maybe millions of people go by but they all disappear from view and i only have eyes for you
i only have eyes for you
moved that is so beautiful
how do you make up that stuff
youre such a poet
you inspire me
a man enters
he starts looking around checking the booths
he looks like a professional enforcer which in fact he is
he is also the smallest of the klane brothers burt klane
vince ducks down under the table
whispers its the baby klane i gotta get the hell out
burt klane strolls to the middle of the room then suddenly turns and faces linda
wheres the little shit
very nervous you gotta be more specific considering our clientele
laughs he wouldnt show his face around here
she looks down at he silently starts to crawl away in the direction of the back door
enjoying calling him names who vincent
that weasel that creep that oily little slug that two bit two timing waste of space that pathetic low life pocket romeo
cutting her off okay enough
the back door opens and vince crawls out on hands and knees
his journey abruptly ends as he now faces klane bob considerably larger than his brother inside
vince is thrown in forcefully into a table
he crashes onto the floor
look what i found crawling around out back
a booth at the back of the restaurant vince is seated with the two klane brothers
he hands over the money he picked up from the bmw
the smaller klane counts it quickly
this is only four thousand the rest is invested
were gonna make a fortune
bob suddenly punches vince in the side knocking the breath out of him
ominous shut up
linda comes over very nervous she looks around then hands over an envelope
i hope this helps please dont hurt him
there you go he counts lindas money another thousand okay this nice lady just bought you a day vince i want it all twenty thousand this time tomorrow
but i just paid just as he opens his mouth vince is elbowed again
thats just the interest
the twentys the principal
linda is walking vince out
that was the most wonderful birthday present anybody ever gave me its your birthday
why didnt you tell me
suddenly honest i cant take the kindness
it gives me the shakes
youll tremble plenty before were through vince benedict
vince brushes himself off hesitates a moment pulling on his left ear with his right hand
immediately behind him facing the opposite direction is another man also pulling on his left ear with his right hand
it is julius their backs are to each other
without ever catching sight of one another they move off going their separate ways
now from this downtown hollywood in all its sleeze
theres a wax museum and a scientology center and every fast food place imaginable and people shouting as they sell things flowers and street food and theres a porno house
showing tight n tender and theres young people dressed like punks and old people boozed out and pimps and druggies and guys slumped unconscious in the gutter and crowds of tourists walking this way that way and theres noise and litter and one more thing theres julius case in hand staring around taking it all in
were a long way from his island now
he studies all the humanity swirling around him and you can see it on his face he loves it
almost a whisper how wonderful
thru thru julius eating a hot dog is walking along a street in hollwyood
in his island peasant garb he doesnt look all that unusual considering his surroundings
but julius is pretty noticable no matter where he goes
more specifically they are watching the expensive looking leather edged suitcase he carries in his hand
they look at the case a moment more then biker gets his machine purring softly
you never saw such lingerie
pull back to reveal julius staring at it shaking his head
to himself what an amazing country
roaring up beside julius smiling ingratiatingly
got a light pal
sorry but i dont smoke
julius thinks hes found a friend
indicating fredericks looking for something for your girl friend
dont have a girl friend
do women really wear these things
if youre lucky
a beat you from out of town
yes a small island in the south pacific about nautical miles south southwest of fiji
biker bounds along and when he reaches julius he grabs the handle of the leather case that julius holds his plan quite obvious to steal the case and disappear into
the crowded street
not an original plan certainly but one that over and over again always works juliuss hand holds fast to it
then as his mouth drops open as we just sort of standing there no big deal not much effort showing on his face as biker begins to slowly rise into
the air as he and his cycle are about to be parted and then still holding to the case as his cycle zooms away from him and for a moment he is flat in mid air parallel to the cement sidewalk and roaring into the crowd and people shriek dive out of its way and falling to the pavement his head colliding hard and hes out and ending its trip as it collides with a storefront and collapses on its side motor still roaring but no movement anymore and stunned going to his unconscious partner
to julius what the hell did you do
julius calmly kneels beside the still form
he puts his case down and his hands move expertly across the prone figure
i did nothing the pavement was his enemy
eyes almost closed as his skilled hands touch the guy a moment more
i would say a concussion a mild shoulder separation and ribs four to seven are cracked
get him to a hospital
and now he picks up his case starts to go pauses
and in the future you should both consider wearing helmets
a sweet smile
thru thru vince approaching his car sees a motorcycle cop putting a ticket under his windshield wiper
vince marches over examines the ticket
fifty three dollars
you gotta be kidding
your vehicles in a handicapped zone
vince immediately hunches his shoulder and affects a limp
do i look normal to you
you dont have a handicapped sticker on your windshield
a beat drivers license please
it is being handcuffed to his cars door handle
youve got over outstanding parking tickets mr
and you just had your birthday
well your drivers license just expired happy birthday
as we hold on vinces depressed face we fade to black julius walks up the stairs leading to the front door
young boys in uniform are raucously enjoying their recess under the supervision of several nuns in habits
so this is where my brother grew up
im glad he had so many friends to play with
an elderly mother superior looks dubiously at julius as he stares out the window down on the playground
he turns and examines the dormitory which is lined with metal cots
he points to a cot near the door and smiles fondly
and thats where he must have slept
how did you know
its the one i would have chosen
its next to the fire extinguisher
in case of a fire i could have given the alarm and saved the other orphans
weve only had one fire at st
vince benedict started it we like to think by accident
the mother superior opens a file cabinet and begins rummaging through it watched by julius
tell me about him
was he a good athlete
did he like chess and poetry
im certain that god had a purpose when he created vincent benedict but it had nothing to do with chess or poetry
she locates a file removes it the only thing inside it is a photograph which falls to her desk
the contents of his file are missing
julius picks up the photo a year old boy leering up at an attractive young nun
this is him
he looks happy sighing he should thats sister maria his biology teacher
i always liked biology
so did vincent
he disgraced sister maria who had to leave the order
then he stole all the money from our library fund and ran away
the mother superior is trying tactfully to close the door on julius
but i have to find him
where do you think he might be
a man of his character could only be in jail
youre full of goodness julius i pray that you never find him
sweet smile as the door is closed and we twins rev
a bunch of people are in the cell along with vince
most noticable is an amazingly tall slender muscular black man
were talking a seven footer here
a bad tempered seven footer
to vince who is scowling at him whatre you lookin at
at you you jerk
the seven footer rises angrily to his full size
vince moves right in on him he may be going through a bad patch but make no mistake vince is tough
to the others in the cell tyrone davis averaged points eleven rebounds and four blocks a game his senior year
first round pick of the l
clippers and now look at him
stunned by the amount of information whore you
as he gives tyrone a card world international athletics representation
vincent benedict president
i coulda got you a no cut contract so you wouldnt have to heist t
sets for a living coming to the cell door
moving away call me when you get out theyre always looking for centers in italy
and as he goes julius is already seated in one of the cubicles separated by a glass partition from the prisoners side
this is a big moment for julius and he looks around as various prisoners are brought in and as a look of pleasure comes across his face leading an attractive
powerful inmate into the room
the guy is juliuss age
trying to fight his excitement watching as the prisoner moves toward him then past him
julius confused stares for a moment straight ahead across the partition and now hes more confused because vince is sitting across from him dubiously studying him arms crossed
there are phones on both sides of the glass partition
the room it should be noted is busy
julius makes a smile
vince just stares
julius mutters excuse me and gets up goes to a nearby soft excuse me but im looking for vincent benedict
pointing to vince you got im
julius turns looks at vince and as he walks back to his side of the cubicle and sits he is overcome with the wonder of it all
impassioned but a bit rambling his emotions are in control vincent
i have rowed halfway across the world no wrong i only rowed one day but i came halfway across the world i know you dont know who i am but
believe me when i say i have been waiting for this moment all my life
its hard to tell what vince is feeling but clearly the look of dubiousness is gone
he picks up the phone on his side gestures for julius to do the same
as julius does vince at last speaks you gotta talk into the phone asshole
julius is confused momentarily
understands now into the phone vincent
listening somewhat amazed
who is this loony
vince glances quickly around to see that no one is listening
i know you dont know who i am but i came halfway across the world cutting in whoa
i still got another six hours to pay the money back
you tell those crummy klane brothers that harassing a man when hes already in the slammer is beneath even them overlapping they do this a lot i dont know any
im your brother julius
stopped dead huh
i dont know any klane brothers
go on i got that part
my name is julius im your twin brother
laughing obviously the minute i sat down i felt like i was looking in a mirror

i wouldnt be too sure
sad you dont believe a word ive said do you
i dont believe a word you said
vincent i dont lie
i am your brother
let me help you get out of here
now hes interested oh

well money talks bullshit walks
how can bullshit walk
is that slang
to himself im in fast company here to julius listen you get me outta here ill be whatever you want best friend brother nephew niece grandma
vince gets up to himself as he leaves just dont ask me to bend over a bunch of impounded cars
vince and julius walk toward a small building in the center
listen twinny i hope you didnt blow your wad on those tickets cause its gonna cost a bunch more to release my car
i have some more money you do
i am happy to help you vincent
youre my brother
i love you
julius look ease up on the love talk or im gonna be tossing my cookies all right
tossing cookies that is more slang
just gimme your wallet okay
as julius sweetly hands it over as julius counts out almost the last of his money to the police attendant who hands him a set of keys
vince grabs them and walks out of the building
i know what youre thinking
no you dont
youre thinking that this whole twin business is what you call bullshit
this is exactly what vince has been thinking
actually i was thinking im going to need some more money to put gas in my car you can take some more money i can
were brothers right
julius tries to drape an arm around vinces shoulder
vince gives him a look
julius drops his arm
vince and julius are walking down a long line of cars
they arrest you they put you behind bars they fine you and then they hide your car
thats points your car isnt it
which is what julius is pointing at
yeah howd you know that was my car
vince unlocks his side gets in
julius smiling and happy starts to walk around to the other side
very happy im so excited well go to museums together discuss philosophy together read books together play chess together get lost together and on that he guns his car the
hell away leaving julius standing there
deserted alone in the sea of cars
as a gleaming new cadillac rolls up to the ticket booth
al leans out from the booth taking in the car and its occupants two men one in a hawaiian shirt one in a tanktop both wearing ray bans
they look like theyre going on vacation
hey the new sedan deville
the driver garfield just nods holds out his hand for the ticket
you guys must be going to hawaii huh
catch that good surf
something like that
the two men just stare straight ahead uninterested in conversation
al hands the driver a ticket
theres plenty of space on level four
the cadillac accelerates up the ramp
as it pulls into a parking spot in the enclosed lot
man larson opens an attache case removes a cassette inserts it into the tape deck while the driver wipes down the steering wheel gearshift etc
with a cloth to remove their fingerprints
as the men get out lock the car wipe off the door handles and then head for the elevator
as vince approaches a door on which a sign reads his door opens and out come two furniture movers with a desk
whatre you doing with my desk
taking back the furniture youre six months behind
he opens a desk drawer pulls out a razor and begins shaving as he walks into his office
almost nothing is left but the phone on the floor with miss busby his secretary standing by it
vince is stunned
i tried to stop them mr
benedict it was time to redecorate anyway
the phone rings miss busby drops to her knees beside it
into phone vincent benedict incorporated sports agent artists representative import export automobile sales rentals and leasing wholesale patio furniture how may i help you
listens briefly oh hi
to vince its al
as she hands him the phone
taking it talking to her sweetly miss busby stacy this is a transition period for the corporation why dont you take a few days off
a little lost aah all right
whatever you say mr
stops oh before i forget
she hands him a gift wrapped present which he opens
aqua velva you shouldnt have she takes her purse smiles goes
when hes alone into phone i hope you got some good news al on the phone in his ticket booth
into phone brand new caddy on level four
thrilled great ill be right over
vince drops to his knees in order to replace the phone into its receiver
he then scrambles up straightens his suit heads for the door making sure his pony tail is perfect
as vince exits turns quickly locks the door turns back into the corridor just in time for this a huge fist slams brutally into his stomach
vince gags falls to his knees as we pull back to reveal morris klane the biggest of them all standing over vince
times up vincent got the money
he bends over picks vince up by the neck like a toy doll straightens him up briefly then buries his fist into vinces gut
vince goes down
harder than last time
in agony on his knees
it hurts to breath
he finally manages to look up at the giant gasping did you hit me yet
cause i didnt feel nothin
he grabs vince again
you gotta understand something benedict i like my work
he pulls vince groggily up and this time hes going for vinces face
he takes his time setting vince up getting his chin at just the right angle
hes concen trating on his work so he doesnt pay much attention to the fact that the elevator door has opened behind
klane draws his fist back and is about to drive it into vinces face when he suddenly pauses the expression on his face at first puzzled becomes increasingly agonized as
we reveal that behind him is squeezing a pressure point on klanes neck rendering him unable to punch out vince
julius maneuvers the klane off of vince and forces him down onto the floor
quietly these are most unfriendly acts you are committing
totally surprised what
i dont know what the problem is but im sure it can be solved without resorting to violence
absolutely in agreement okay okay
julius lets go of klane who gets to his feet turns around and instantly lets fly with his fist at juliuss face
here julius effortlessly blocks the punch and goes right on talking
you moved too soon
klane spins and aims a karate kick at juliuss head
julius coolly ducks it and sends klane crashing into a wall
an important rule in a crisis situation negotiate first attack last
you never negotiated
you dont know what kind of enemy i am
klane drags himself to his feet while trying to gauge what hes up against
who are you
happily were twins
klane isnt buying it
seeing a fire axe inside a glass case on the wall he smashes through and grabs it
you have no respect for logic klane charges julius who sidesteps his blow
the axe is is imbedded in the wall
as julius grabs him
and i have no respect for those with no respect for logic
youre a very stupid person
watching as julius picks up klane with both hands and lifts him a foot up into the air holding him there for a pause
and this next is timed perfectly as he pushes the elevator button and
slides open and
as he heaves klane across the corridor into the open elevator klane crashes down hard just as the door slides shut and
shouting as the door closes on the crumpled klane
tell your brother he messes with me he messes with my whole family
despite himself vince is definitely warming to julius
happy i like it when you hit people
i hate violence
but youre so good at it
we ought to go into business together
you could be a boxer and ill be your manager
i dont think i could fight for money
you do the fighting ill keep all the money
laughing im worried about you vincent
they reach vinces mustang and get in
how much money do you owe
dont lie were twins i can feel your pain
exploding why do you keep saying that
were not twins were not brothers were nothing and youre only in this car because i could use a little protection these days twins rev
closing his eyes twenty thousand
a beat then quietly due this morning
suddenly vince bangs his forehead with the palm of his hand
i dont know where my head is i forgot i promised this friend of mine sammy id pick up his car at the airport do me a big favor okay
drive this car back from the airport for me
id love to
julius reaches into the glove compartment takes out the car manual begins speed reading it running his index finger down the center of each page
what are you doing with that finger
learning to drive
vince isnt sure whats going on at this point
now julius studies vinces shifting moves the way his hands work the steering wheel
now hes back to the manual
now hes staring at vince
vince and juliuss heads are both in motion now juliuss from the book to the wheel vinces from the road to juliuss finger
as their heads keep turning twins rev
vince checks beneath the caddys tires then rises frustrated
whats the matter
that dopey sam he did it again
forgot to leave the keys
a lot of handicapped kids are gonna be really disappointed
moved handicapped children
this car was supposed to be auctioned off at their charity drive tomorrow
oh well lets go eat
maybe we should try to open it ourselves
vince raises his eyebrows in mock surprise
you think we should do a thing like that
of course its for the children
vince inserts it into the cadillacs drivers side window watched by julius
feigning ignorance i saw a guy from the auto club do this once
the door locks suddenly pop up in unison
as he takes a breath opens the door scoots inside and the instant he does there is this terrible shrieking siren sound vince frantically scrambles around lying on the car
seat trying to make it stop but he cant and then two things happen o twins rev
first the car tilts and vince is pitched unceremoniously forward landing on the floor of the car under the steer ing wheel
he scrambles back to the seat its not easy because of the angle
second the siren stops
vince looks out the car window
holding the rear of the car several feet up in the air
when the back end is raised to an angle greater than degrees a mercury switch activates the automatic cutoff system
the alarms computer thinks the car is being towed away and shuts off
its beginning to dawn on vince that there may be more to julius than meets the eye
the cadillac passes by vince at the wheel
now the mustang comes along julius at the wheel
he drives terribly stopping and starting jerking along
julius suddenly puts his foot on the gas and roars past vincent
julius is speeding like a kid with a new toy
suddenly the car phone beeps
he locates the source of the sound and picks up the phone
into phone vincent benedicts car
a beat vincent
where are you
t twins rev
ya see that little dot in your rearview mirror
waving into mirror hi vincent
theres a supermarket up ahead
take your foot off the gas and very very very gently put it on the brake
the brake right
as julius makes a sharp turn on two wheels into the parking lot and comes to a dramatic squealing stop that spins the car around degrees
vinces car pulls in a moment later
he gets out gazes at the skid marks as a smiling julius approaches
the brakes worked just fine
lemme tell you something about america julius nobody likes a smart ass
julius and vince enter the supermarket
are pushing a cart down one of the other aisles
linda is filling it with birthday candles cake mixes etc
t twins rev
as she reaches for some cake mix angels food or devils food
the answers obvious
theres only one vince benedict
hes a force of nature
o twins rev
and that poetry he pretends to write
theyre old song lyrics linda
linda stops pushing the cart and looks at her
i know that geez you dont think i know that
soft its so cute the way he thinks hes tricking me
anyway whats wrong about other peoples songs
some guys tell you dirty jokes
it just proves that vince has a romantic soul
adjacent to the express checkout lane where linda and marnie now join the line
julius picks up a playboy and begins speed reading it
his eyes widen at what hes reading and seeing and when he reaches the centerfold he audibly gasps
she reaches past julius to take a copy of cosmopolitan
julius drops the playboy which falls open on the ground with the centerfold revealed
flustered and blushing he bends down to retrieve it watched by marnie who cant take her eyes off the sheer beauty of his physique
looking at the centerfold shes not bad
embarrassed im sorry
i had no idea these magazines had things like that
julius tries to stuff the centerfold back into the maga zine but only manages to crumple it
linda and marnie exchange a look
o twins rev
whereve you been
gulping a desert island
as a matter of fact a small tropical island in the south pacific about nautical miles south southwest of fiji
i only got here yesterday but already ive found my wonderful brother
they all turn and look at vince whos pulled his cart up behind them
proudly my twin brother vincent
linda and marnie stunned look from vince to julius
to linda god you look beautiful in this light
i didnt know you had a brother
you all know each other
julius meet linda and
sarcastic her charming sister marnie
to julius twins
o twins rev
the girls stand holding their bags while the brothers are each in their cars
waving goodbye girls see you soon
and he guns off
waving goodbye girls see you soon
and he guns off too only in his excitement hes gone into reverse
embarrassed ive only been drivng for an hour
now he follows vince
why do i think im going to see him again
beat like maybe tomorrow
vince leads julius from the garage to the front door
julius is carrying all the grocery bags
linda is your girl friend isnt she
is marnie your girl friend too
marnie hates my guts
she seemed to like you
trying not to sound too interested she hardly knows me
thats the best way women love men who are mysterious and devious
it keeps them on their toes makes them excited you know what i mean
you do like women dont you
very much theyre
strange and sensitive and they have compassion
i have the highest respect for women
vince listens to this earnest declaration and tries to keep a straight face
suddenly the truth dawns on him
now correct me if im wrong
youre a virgin arent you
vince clocks juliuss reaction as he removes an eviction notice from his front door
to himself hes a pound virgin
its a small one bedroom decorated primarily with garden furniture
as they come inside vince is confronted by a reproachfully meowing cat
to cat alright
i got your food
liver and cheese chicken giblets all your favorites julius
you named your cat julius
vince freezes realizing the implications
vince is seasoning some containers of take out food and popping them in the microwave while julius strokes the cat who shares his name
the secret to take out veal parmesan is adding a little extra cheese
i know youre probably used to growing your own vegetables and spearing fish in the lagoon but here on the mainland we just nuke it
the microwave alarm sounds and it pops open
dinner is served
as vince and julius prepare to eat they both turn their plates counter clockwise then dab their lips with their napkins
they both reach for the salt at the same moment
they both freeze and stare at each other for a long beat
julius smiles and we a man pushing forty appears taking a keychain with a caddy fob on it from his pocket
this is webster
dressed in businessmans clothing he looks odd but not necessarily frightening
he walks to the spot where the car was
its definitely empty
he looks at the cadillac key
clearly he is not happy at the turn of events
theyve finished eating
expansive so let me get this right
one of our fathers was a famous football player another one was a physicist at m
he won the nobel prize
vince playing along rolls his eyes
so all of our dads were these big shots and mom was like superwoman but she didnt survive our delivery
i got sent to an orphanage while you were brought up in a tropical paradise by this scientist you do research for but who doesnt actually pay you because you
dont need money
a beat did i leave anything out
julius ignores vinces cynicism
i think its important we try to find our fathers
you mean all those geniuses who contributed to the
making a jerk off gesture sperm milkshake
why are you being so immature about this
vince throws down his napkin
do you know how many times ive heard stories like this
its every orphans fantasy my real mom and dad were rich and beautiful but there was a mix up at the hospital and i got switched with another baby
but one day theres going to be a knock at the door and there theyll be with open arms crying
we didnt know
how can we make it up to you
a beat im telling you this for your own good julius
its a crock
vince goes over to a trunk rummages in it comes up with a dusty mouldering folder from which he removes a yellow ing piece of paper
i liberated this from my file at the orphanage
read it and weep
julius takes the paper and reads aloud
dear sister anderson your request for orphans benefits for vincent benedict has been denied
according to our files his mother did not die during birth
we have a current address for her at canyon glen drive los angeles
vincents case seems to be one of simple abandonment and as such he is inelligible for aid
vince snatches the paper back
julius stares at him just stunned
thats right julius she abandoned me
this letter was written thirty years ago
we were five years old our mother
didnt die when we were born
staring at vince now youve known all this time where she was and you never contacted her
angry i dont know about your momma miss perfect of but my momma was a slut and if shes still alive i hope shes in a lot of pain
she dumped me once no way she gonna get a chance to do it again vincent if they lied to us about momma for all these years maybe they lied
to her too
we must find her we must check this address
he cant hide the excitement
julius slow down ive got no time for this
you go hunt down mom ive got a cash flow problem to deal with
vince goes to the phone which is ringing
into phone what
we havent forgotten about you benedict you better have our money tomorrow morning
or else what
suddenly vinces living room windows explode in a burst of gunfire
vince and julius hit the floor and try to shield themselves from the shattering glass
the sound of a car squealing away outside the window
everyone seems so angry in america
a sign in front reads southland aerospace
the driver of the cadillac garfield and his partner larson now dressed in suits and ties walk along an executive corridor toward the reception area
the tests on the lower temperature gaskets look great
looks like an easy weekend
as they head for garfields office a secretary tries to hail them
garfield theres a
preoccupied not now
as they enter they suddenly stop and stare as we
pull back to reveal webster immaculate and well mannered rising from a chair
who are you
friendly im webster its okay
on the sound of the name
he looks at larson
terribly upset christ man you were never supposed to come here
rattled the deal was we were never supposed to meet
youre supposed to be
driving that cadillac to texas
holds up his gloved hands got my driving gloves got my driving glasses got my hat
but no car
the car was there
the merchandise was in the trunk
your instructions were on the cassette
to garfield he wants more money
thats what this is about
let me explain something to you
i have a reputation to uphold
people put their trust in me because they know i always deliver the goods and i always come back with the money
this whole thing is making me look very bad
this is bullshit
the car was there
the parking attendant thought we were off for hawaii
a brief pause the parking attendant
he liked the car
wed put on those damn loud shirts so wed look like tourists he asked us if we were going surfing
he was a jerk
webster suddenly gets to his feet smiles
you know i just realized that in twenty years of service no other client has ever seen my face
nervously i dont think thats a problem
webster pulls out a silencer equipped pistol and puts a bullet in each of their foreheads
they lie very still and very dead
guess youre right
as webster emerges from garfields office and then turns back as if to say goodbye watched by garfields secretary
thanks for everything guys
ill see what i can do about those laker tickets
a beat yeah ill tell her
webster closes the door behind him smiles charmingly at garfields secretary
they want you to hold their calls
theyre going to be working late
thru thru as julius jogs steadily uphill checking the occasional house number against the address on vinces letter
an imposing security gate stands wide open as several cars roll through it and climb up the long driveway
julius checking the address sprints in after them just before the gates close
as julius jogs up to the front door
the circular driveway is filled with cars
adults and children are visible on the grounds it appears that a party is in progress
julius rings the doorbell which is answered by granger a man of about hes dressed in swimming trunks and sports an impressive physique
hes holding the hand of a five year old girl
julius and granger look at one another and for a brief moment hesitate as if each of them finds the other vaguely familiar
after a beat yes
im terribly sorry to disturb your party and i realize this might sound strange but im looking for someone who lived here a long time ago
finally mary anne benedict
granger reacts hes speechless
julius hands him the group photo of his mother six fathers traven and werner
she was my mother
granger looks at the photo then at julius
youre mary annes son
pointing at photo isnt that you grandpa
julius gently takes the photo from the girl looks at the face she pointed at then at granger
now julius is speechless granger is one of his fathers
to girl why dont you go help your grandma with lunch honey
the little girl disappears back inside
granger clearly shaken looks at julius
they told your mother that you died at birth
on juliuss reaction as we trophies framed photos other memorabilia of grangers illustrious football career adorn the walls
julius studies them admiringly while granger looks at the group photo
i guess you could say im your father
one of my fathers wistfully studying photo mary anne benedict
i havent said her name aloud for over years
she was the love of my life
shaking his head the times ive wondered what would have happened if id married her
why didnt you
she turned me down
said she was afraid to have children
she took it real hard when they told her you died
she even stopped painting
did you know she painted
until yesterday i didnt even know she might still be alive
who told her we died
i have a twin brother vincent
theres two of you
she never knew that either
this really gets to granger the injustice of it all
he points to travens face in the photo
he supervised the experiment for the government
hes the one responsible for all of this
he still runs the genetics lab at los alamos new mexico
ill go see him
watch out for him hes kind of a dickhead if you know what i mean
no i dont but im learning
as the cadillac enters through a gate and makes its way past the hulks of dead cars towards the same body shop we saw earlier
as vince cleans out the glove compartment pocketing some cigars and spare change
he pulls the cassette out of the stereo glances at it pops it back in turns it on and hears mr
webster i hope youre happy with the vehicle we chose for your little journey
when you get to houston phone and ask for beetroot mckinley
he will arrange to trade you a briefcase for the merchandise in the trunk
vince stops the car dead the body shop owner comes up to him
lets check it out
as the chop shop owner checks under the hood of the caddy vince moves to the back of the car and pops open the trunk
the trunk is filled with a sleeping bag that might contain a dead body
vince unzips the bag sees some kind of giant engine part
he tries to lift it out it wont budge
vince closes the trunk vince looks at the owner whos already counting out the cash from his bankroll
the cars okay ill give you three grand
deciding and getting in the car sorry the cars been promised for a kids charity
okay four grand
as vince starts to drive away calling out okay six thousand thats as high as im going
thru thru a piece of paper by the phone on which vince is writing
its got beetroot mckinleys name and phone number on it
and also one amount
on the desk is a map with houston circled
vince has just finished dialing
the phone is picked up before the first ring is half over
a sign on the top of the building reads mckinley aerospace
beetroot mckinley talkin
he doesnt know whether to shit or wind his watch just now god knows what hes into
whos cloggin up the line
webster calling from california
i happen to have some merchandise you might want int
mckinleys office day a huge office in houston
we are looking at the bottom of a pair of fancy boots
it blocks the view for the moment of the speaker but we can see a briefcase on the desk
mckinley well bring it to me son and let me enrich you
its the amount of enrichment i want to talk about
boots down now we are looking at a very rich very tough s
mckinley dont try and renegotiate with old beetroot son edgy
his pencil bounces up and down on the crucial amount the twenty thousand

im not delivering any goddam cadillac without knowing for sure i got twenty for my cut
mckinleys office beetroot
mckinley listen you little shit for brains peckerwood youre out of your goddam crazy diseased greedy mind
we can see the briefcase now by the way its open and seems quite full of money
clearing his throat taken aback by the violence of beetroots tone

listen to me you poor excuse for a warmed over turd a deals a deal but int
mckinleys office closeup mckinley day mckinley dont but me the deal is five i can do better than five here
mckinley on his feet in a fury if you can do better than five million dollars take it
as the words five million dollars really sink in
we are looking at what just might be the high moment of his life
hard to breathe f five million dollars
he writes down the proper amount now
then he kisses the piece of paper
into phone beetroot
ill see you in houston after all fair is fair
staring at the written ill just have to find it in my heart to live with your offer
vince hangs up jumps up and screams with joy
he puts the cassette in his pocket crumples up the piece of paper and sky hooks it into the waste basket
five million dollars
al and his wife carla are tied to chairs in the dining room
webster sits between them drinking a cup of coffee and calmly loading his gun
your boss at the lot told me you were on duty when the cadillac clocked in
now whats his name
his name is vince benedict
webster puts down the gun jots down the name
thats certainly a beginning
to al im really disappointed in you ratting on your best friend
to carla my best friend whos been screwing my wife for three years
all three years
indicating webster angry and you never told me until there was a stranger listening
shit what about my reputation

hes my friend
well i guess ill have to beat it out of you webster suddenly kicks over the chair with al on it
carla screams stop ill tell he lives at westridge place hes got an office at the corner of highland and hollywood
webster writes it all down
thanks for saving me
i always loved you al
its just i couldnt resist vince
its those eyes he does this thing with his eyes
i love you too carla
getting up heading for the door shaking his head no ones gonna believe this one
as vince comes out of his house carrying a sleeping bag pillow some clothing a six pack of soft drinks
on top of the stack is a map of the western u
which hes studying while singing the song houston singing going back to houston houston houston
vince tosses the items into the back seat of the caddy just as julius jogs up the driveway and collapses against the caddie door
hes red in the face completely drenched with sweat gasping for breath having run all the way from bel air
panting vince the most amazing thing has happened
you scared the living shit out of me i met one of our fathers
he told me of a man in new mexico who probably knows where momma is
julius in his fervor grips vince by the shoulders
she didnt abandon you she didnt even know you were born
feigning concern awww thats terrible
vince removes juliuss hands slides him away from the door and opens it
and she was told that i died
look julius im in kind of a hurry
sammy wants me to take the car to houston
much bigger bucks when you raffle for charity in houston
julius takes the map from vince looks at it
excited new mexico is on the way to houston
snatching back map a lot of places are on the way to houston
ill be back in a few days
stay in my apartment
run up my phone bill
throw wild parties
take advantage of me
vince gets in behind the wheel
julius marches around the car and gets into the passenger seat beside him
vincent we have to go see this man traven in new mexico
no we dont
julius slams his hand down on the top of the dash
yes we do
and im coming with you
vince realizing that julius wont be denied tries a new tack
you know youre right
this is fate destiny but theres no way im gonna drive for miles with you smelling like that calming down youre right ill take a shower be right back julius
leaps out of the car and bounds into vinces apartment
as soon as the door shuts behind him vince hits the caddys ignition and begins squealing out of the driveway in reverse
just as linda and marnies car pulls into it blocking his path
vince slams his hands down onto the wheel in frustration
linda and marnie get out of their car singing happy birthday
linda approaches vince with a birthday cake complete with lit candles
to himself why does everybody have to like me so much
vince gets out of the car and although it kills him tries to put on a happy face for linda
happy birthday vince
oh please its not my birthday anymore happy birthday vince
is julius around
marnie walks into the house
linda gazes at vinces belongings in the caddy
crestfallen where are you going
nowhere you were going somewhere you werent even going to say goodbye vince knowing when hes beat whispers conspiratorially
okay okay look you cant tell anybody this not even your sister but im onto something so huge it gives me a rash just thinking about it
i got something in here pats the trunk i dont even know what it is thats worth a fortune
shrieks a fortune
an apartment door opens revealing a female neighbor of vinces
never sleep with that man
never loan him money
and never believe a word he tells you thats free advice
she slams the door shut
as if innocent i borrowed a cup of sugar from her once
im coming with you
im not letting you out of my sight
no youre not
i am because if you say no one more time suddenly shouting ill tell everybody youre hiding a fortune in your a hand over her mouth hes beaten and he
knows it okay okay
just dont let on to julius
he thinks were going to look up our ancestors like in roots or something
marnie snoops around examines the group photo lying on top of juliuss suitcase
in the b
she can hear julius singing in the shower put on your red dress baby cause were going out tonight
she puts the photo back as the sound of shower stops
julius emerges from the bathroom clutching a towel around his waist and freezes at the sight of marnie
embarrassed marnie excuse me i was just taking a shower
holding up a box of cookies i heard you singing i baked some cookies for you
an awkward silence
i guess it was a dumb idea
not at all im really looking forward to tasting them
a beat i should put on some clothes but im not sure
oh dont mind me
she turns her back to him
julius realizes he has no clean shirt
i hope vince doesnt mind if i borrow one of his shirts
while eyeing julius through her compact just dont try wearing his pants
they both turn as throws open the door with a big smile on her face
vince just invited us all to go to new mexico and texas
vince comes in behind linda trying to conceal his exasperation
thats a great idea vince
thru thru the car vince at the wheel roaring away the four of them happily inside
now from the opposite direction comes another car
webster is driving
he spots the address turns in and as he does its pretty much a shambles as webster ransacks the place
frustrated he moves out of the room as we as webster begins working it over
he lifts up the mattress its heavy pushes it to the floor and knocks the wastebasket over
as webster unfolds it reads beetroot mckinleys name phone number and the sum million dollars
vinces cat appears at websters feet meowing
he reaches down and strokes it
webster is feeding the cat when he hears a sudden violent pounding at the front door
open up benedict
i know youre in there
to cat your owner seems to be a very popular fellow these days
as it crashes open revealing burt klane and his two large brothers bob and morris
morris has his elbow in a sling and a bandage on his head courtesy of julius
they spread out
and then freeze at the sound of running water from the kitchen tap
as the klanes burst inside and see webster turn off the tap and begin drying his hands
hes friendly solicitous definitely non threatening
who are you
its not really important is it
i wanted to feed the cat before i left
webster starts for the door
morris the really big one blocks the doorway cutting webster off
i asked you a question
webster shrugs exhales
who are you
helping out were the klane brothers
thats burt and morris im bob
interesting genetic pool
youre looking for vince benedict right
the brothers all nod
am i vince benedict
morris stares hard at him shakes his head
so whats the difference who i am
hit him bob
bob steps forward
before he can do anything webster pulls out his gun and shoots him in the foot
then webster turns and shoots burt in the foot
the two brothers crumble to the floor screaming in agony
to morris your brothers seem to have a problem with their feet
dangerously to morris it could be contagious
morris immediately backs away and lets webster pass by
polite as he leaves have a good good day
a sign reads welcome to arizona
the caddy roars by
j twins rev
linda in the front seat has her head resting on vinces shoulder
marnie has her head on juliuss shoulder as well
she seems peacefully asleep while julius sits carefully not daring to move
as marnie cuddles closer to him her short skirt rides even higher up her thighs
julius sighs deeply
his biceps bulge and one of the shirt sleeves tears apart at the seams
vince watches through the rearview mirror knows whats going on
or rather what isnt going on yet
he drives on through the night
the car speeds by
the car is being serviced
linda and marnie are stretch ing their legs
did julius like the cookies
im not sure
he said theyd provide one hundred percent of the average daily requirement of fourteen source vitamins in a high fiber form thats an integral part of a properly balanced diet
linda looks at her
i think thats good
i really hope so
j twins rev
vince picks out a t shirt from the racks for julius
this ought to fit you
julius removes the shirt he borrowed from vince who pretends to be horrified at the sight of juliuss huge muscles
whoa get away from that window
theres women and children out there
staring at him what is wrong with you
you allergic to something
what are those bumps doing all over your body
youre all swelled up
you look like youre about to explode
finally getting it we cant all be born beautiful like you vince
some of us julius puts on the t shirt and looks at himself in a mirror
emblazoned across its front is a hells angel death head and the motto born to be bad
are just born to be bad
its you julius
oooh you are so scary
linda and marnie watch by the car as the boys emerge from the shop
they stare at the t shirt on julius
as he walks past julius slaps her five
lets rock and roll
he opens the car door and climbs in
to the girls its his first t shirt
the car driving along
as vince pulls the car to a stop in front of the motel
linda and marnie get out followed by julius who starts to get into the front seat beside vince
marnie touches his hand
see you later
julius blushing climbs into the front seat while vince leers out the window at linda
see if you can get us a room with a king sized bed okay
linda smiles at him and winks
julius misunderstanding the sleeping arrangements leans out the window
to linda or to vince thats not necessary
i always sleep on the floor
vince looks askance at julius then pulls the car away
hold on linda and marnie gazing curiously after them
the caddy drives through this mysterious town in the mountains of new mexico
julius and vince have parked the car and are walking to a research building
vince is trying to humor julius who is full of a quiet confidence
now promise me something
if this professor traven says hes never heard of mom and us twins and all our dads and the experiment i dont want you to be upset
a beat because this is entirely possible
you still think im making it all up dont you
as traven now a tanned fit year old stands framed in his office doorway looking coldly out at vince and julius
he looks like more of a prick than ever
i dont know who you are and i dont know what youre talking about
now get the hell out of here before i call security
traven slams the door shut in their faces
vindicated well thats that
on to houston
he leads a stunned julius down the corridor towards several armed security guards
keep your voice down
this place is crawling with security for the first time in my life i am looking for the word pissed off
dont do this to me
i got a car to deliver
the last thing i need is a detour in the slammer julius furiously stops and turns around
im going to make him tell us the truth
traven looks up from some papers on his work table as comes flying off its hinges and crashes to the floor
marches inside towards a startled traven as vince tries to restrain him
julius shrugs vince aside approaches traven and shoves the group photo into his face
indicating photo thats our mother those are our six fathers thats werner and thats you
traven decides turns to vince
you turned out just like i thought you would vincent
what did you do escape from prison
vince stops dead shell shocked
how did you know my name
reptilian smile i named you
vinces jaw drops as he realizes holy shit
its all true
as camera moves slowly down it we realize this is a reprise of our films opening location
chained and padlocked
traven unlocks it pulls off the chains
the very same one we saw in our opening now covered in dust and cobwebs
julius and vince take it all in theyre numb while traven seems in control again
this room was sealed as soon as your mother gave birth
approaches a delivery table touches it gently looks back at traven
you came out first of course
indicating vince we werent expecting him
gazes at the blender we saw traven demonstrating in
awestruck this must be where you made the milkshake
gazes contemptuously at vince
we werent making milkshakes
indicating julius we were making the most fully developed human the world has ever seen
vince is not unhappy at this information
but instead of just one perfect kid mom had two of us way to go mom
the embryo split in two but it didnt split equally
all the purity and strength went into julius
all the crap that was left over went into what you see in the mirror every morning
stunned whoa im the crap
its not true vince
no i want to hear this
to traven im left over crap
im no good
angry tears well up in vinces eyes
just look at him you tellin me im a side effect
dismissive you havent got the brainpower to understand this vincent and i havent got the time shows over
he turns to go
julius grabs traven slams him up against the wall
at boiling point tell us where our mother is
terrified whispering pines
its an artists colony
two hundred miles north of santa fe
if youre lying to me
the famous snarl ill be back
julius tosses him aside
vince is sitting in the car slumped over the wheel
my life just got flushed down the toilet
youre wrong vincent
your lifes just about to begin
im genetic garbage
julius shakes his head
vincent were twins
vince looks at his brother
patronizing i know this is a touchy subject for you julius
but the fact is we dont look the same we dont act the same we dont talk the same we dont dress the same
angry so how come if were the same were so damn different
we had six fathers vince
were different parts of a lot of different people
vince is starting to get interested again
and remember i was taken to a beautiful island protected educated loved given every opportunity to grow to dream to create
but you had none of that
all the bravado about loving being an orphan has gone now
you had nobody
nobody to love you nobody to trust you nobody to encourage you
all life taught you was that the only person you could count on was yourself
tears begin to well up in vinces eyes
youre the missing part of my life and im the missing part of your life
and when we find our mother we can fill the missing part of hers
we wont be alone anymore vince
a beat we can be a family
vince looks at his brother
you really think so
vince thinks about it some more
with like thanksgiving dinner
and christmas trees
and a real home where youll always be welcome
even when youve been bad
vince begins to brighten
as vince ushers julius through the door
is this necessary
im not introducing you to my mother dressed like some goatsherder from albania
you need some new clothes
a sales clerk approaches vince
can i help you sir
do i look like i need help
indicating julius heres the problem
looking around maybe ill try on a couple of things myself
as vince and julius emerge dressed in identical outfits each in his own way looks like a male model from an italian fashion magazine
do i look okay
you look better put it that way
we got to do something about the way you walk
youre moving a tad stiff jules
ever see frankenstein
i read the book
thats not gonna help
you got to walk like youre moving in time to music
im not talking about military marches now i mean aretha franklin otis redding wilson pickett archie bell and the drells and a couple of white guys
julius doesnt have a clue
vince dons sunglasses and demonstrates a soulful strut
you just got to try to be cool you know
try these on
julius puts on sunglasses snaps his fingers tries to ape vinces moves while vince appraises him
am i cool now
linda and marnie look up in amazement as vince and julius bop down the pavement towards them
excited we know where to find our momma
everything julius said was true
im the product of geniuses
i always knew that

julius hangs back something is bothering him
embarrassed a burst vince youve got to help me ive never been out on a date before

julius looks at his brother

julius shakes his head
well forget all that disco shit everyones seen it
when i really want to romance a girl i waltz with her

it turns them to putty in your hands
he shoves a chair out of the way making a little room
okay come here put your feet by my feet coming over thank you for this vince a pained look on his face i said put your feet by my feet
not on my feet
julius looks at his brother then self consciously takes his hands
ill lead you follow
okay one two three turn
ad lib as follows put your arm here youre breaking my fingers youre not wrestling a boar miles south southwest of fiji dont clench your teeth vince begins to take
julius through the steps slowly at first then as julius gains confidence they begin to sail round the room and we twins rev
julius and marnie in the middle of the large dance floor in a large club and julius is waltzing magnificently
marnie thrilled stays with him step for step as we pull back to reveal vince and linda waltzing brilliantly too
the four of them have the whole floor to themselves as other dancers ring the area watching and shouting encouragement
the song ends everyone applauds our two couples head over to their table
to julius well youve learned to waltz
now its time to introduce you to the wonderful world of getting shit faced
vince linda julius and marnie are seated at a table covered with quite a few empty beer bottles
they are all a little drunk
did you know they had beer in ancient egypt
actually it was invented by the assyrians but the eygptians were the first people to perfect the malt fermentation process
you sure know a lot about beer
he knows a lot about everything
julius polishes off the bottle belches
j twins rev
but its all from books
until tonight i never had a beer
all theory no practice the story of my life
well were going to change all that arent we marnie
julius embarrassed looks over at marnie whos smiling sweetly at him
can i ask you a question

linda surprised does a spit take with her beer
laughing youre getting there
vince gets to his feet
please excuse me my back teeth are floating
julius looks at marnie blushes gets to his feet
i better see if mine are too
julius takes off after vince
as vince and julius approach the urinals
the both si multaneously flush before unzipping

j twins rev
lying not all the time
a beat listen marnies got the hots for you
tonight could be your lucky night
i dont think she really likes me
piece of cake
youre nervous cause its your first time
were you nervous
i was twelve and she was a nun thats real pressure
they both finish at the urinals and begin washing at the sink
i got to admit it jules since i met you life is getting better all the time
julius a little smashed cant hide his feelings
he grips vince by the shoulders
for me too vince
sometimes im so happy i want to pick you up and hug you
julius starts to do so just as another man enters
hey cut it out
not in here
julius releases vince who clocks the other mans reaction
to julius go easy on the beer okay
j twins rev
mckinleys office night lookin forward to it
as beetroot hangs up the camera slowly pans to reveal he is not alone
in the b
is a very hard looking man beetroots bodyguard
and standing close to the desk is webster
to webster sorry webster looks like im doin business with someone else
nods id do the same thing
you want the delivery its not your problem who delivers
handing him a card if you ever need me my answering service forwards all messages
and hes gone
handing card to bodyguard put this in my personal file
staring at the door god i love a professional
linda and marnie both a little tipsy
linda suddenly freezes at the sight of morris klane scoping the room
morris is still wearing a bandage from his beating by julius
did you tell anybody we were coming to santa fe
unconcerned well i phoned work and told them we wouldnt be coming in for a few days
oh i forgot to tell you weve been fired
tight lipped lets go to the ladies room
but we just went
linda takes marnie by the hand just as each with a cast on his foot each supported by a crutch force them back into the booth
hello girls do you mind if we sit down and enjoy the music with you
approach the table
burt and bob open their jackets revealing they have guns on the girls
morris klane appears behind vince and julius
this has gone way past a simple case of loan deliquency
we dont like getting shot
what are you talking about
we didnt shoot anybody
its no way to do business
what do you want
we want to take vince out to the parking lot and kill him
a long beat
thats kind of drastic dont you think
morris grabs vince roughly by the arm
ominous dont touch him
suddenly rough this is not your problem you dont want me to hurt these lovely ladies do you
he pushes his gun into marnies side
cries out ow
you moved too soon
the second rule in a crisis situation wary hes starting that funny talk again
if you choose to bluff you must be prepared to have your bluff called
this is no bluff asshole burt gives a small head signal and two very large men stand up from a nearby table
they each grab one of juliuss arms
meet my cousins
to the klanes get these jerks outside
just then so sudden and quick that its over as soon as it begins julius double kicks the seated burt and bob in the head
theyre out cold before they realize theyve been attacked
without stopping julius whips his arms together in front of him bringing sam and dave into painful contact with each others head
they too are now out cold
vince uses this opportunity to stomp with all his might on the toe of morris whos busy watching julius dismantle his relatives
morris screams and lets go of vince who runs to the nearby pool table grabs a cue and slams it over the head of the now hobbling morris
all five klanes are out cold
how many of those
rules do you have
quite a few
they were formulated by a kendo swordsman in the th century but their philosophical underpinnings can be applied to many other areas of life
thru thru o twins rev
julius is unpacking his suitcase on one of the beds arranging his books on the bedside table hanging his clothes on hangars
vince watches him glances at his watch and begins to edge towards the door
we got cable tv a fully stocked bar free ice were in great shape
where you going
i thought id just go and tuck linda in for the night
vince picks up one of julius heavy tomes
maybe read her a bedtime story
with a wink dont wait up for me
julius looks fondly at his brother as he sees him to the door
what a day vincent we visited our birth place
we bought new clothes
we danced the waltz
we get into a fight weve got this great room
heart felt it just doesnt get any better than this
vince gives julius a sly look as he lets himself out of the room
oh yes it does
showing a clip of the stooges at their moronic best
sits watching the tv nodding in amusement laughing slapping his knee in pleasure
o twins rev
he returns his attention to the book hes been reading something the size of a dictionary but cant help returning his gaze to the tv
he freezes at the sound of a knock at the door
embar rassed by what hes been watching he quickly turns off the tv and goes to answer the door still holding the book
calling out you forgot your key i know
lucky i waited up
julius opens the door revealing marnie who walks in right past him
hi vince and linda want to be alone so im afraid im going to stay here
which bed should i take
i always sleep on the floor
watched by julius marnie pulls the curtains shut kills the overhead lights all the while providing him with glimpses of various parts of her anatomy
she gets into one of the beds turns off the bedside lamp
julius puts the blanket and pillow from the other bed onto the floor between the two beds then shuts off the other lamp
this mattress is awful
getting out of bed she pulls the blanket and pillow with her as she steps over julius who tries not to look up and gets into the other bed
this mattress is just as bad as the other one
she gets out again dragging the blanket and pillow puts them down on the floor next to julius
she crawls under the blanket turns her back to him
o twins rev
this is better
marnie shivers chattering her teeth
are you cold
no please take my shirt
julius strips it off and hands it to her
she puts it on and pulls the blanket over her shoulder
again she shivers
you still cold
just my legs
julius lies there thinking about it
well i could give you my
sitting up thanks
julius reaches under the blanket removes his bottoms and passes them over
marnie puts them on under her blanket
id love a glass of water
realizes that hes now nude right
he wraps his blanket around his waist goes into the bathroom comes out with a glass of water
he hands it to her
she spills the water all over her top and bedding
she starts stripping off everything shes wearing
julius averts his eyes
do you mind if i share your blanket
mines all wet
gulps no that would be okay
they both lie down under his blanket
could we switch sides
i like to sleep on the left
she starts to roll over julius then pauses directly above him and looks him dead in the eye
can i ask you something for a change
do you like me
i mean even a little bit
im crazy about you marnie
but theres something about me you ought to know
marnie tenses expecting the worst
looking away im a virgin
marnie glances heavenward and silently mouths the words thank you
she smiles down at julius and starts very gently kissing him
linda dressed in a negligee comes out of the bathroom area
vince wearing pajamas is on the floor legs curled under the bed doing sit ups
under his breath counting eighteen nineteen you sick or something
julius gave me a few pointers counting seventy five seventy six i dont need to exercise but moms gonna see me for the first time in thirty five years i
wanna look my best
shell love you whatever you look like
i know she will i have that effect on people counting one hundred and forty three one forty four beat i just hope shes not too disappointed in julius he
cant help how weird he seems at the start t twins rev
i think youre nervous
hey i sleep great every night beat softer what if shes disappointed in me
pats the bed cmere
final sit up five hundred
gets up dont want to overdo
he goes into her arms
if shes disappointed in you then shes a fake who could want more from a son
thinking about it youre right
a beat i couldnt do this without you linda
thats why when we get back i think we should move in together
move in together
im not saying we have to get married or anything and its not about me wanting to keep an eye on you either
warmly i just want to live with you
im no good at playing house im grouchy in the morning cranky in the afternoon moody at night t twins rev
i promise not to try and make you happy unless you want me to
vince is clearly unnerved by the twin emotional demands of linda and meeting his mother
why dont we sleep on this okay
i mean ive got a big day tomorrow
shifting gears its gonna be great taking my best girl to meet my mom
am i really your best girl
theres nobody else linda not anymore
there better not be because
quoting i only have eyes for you
theyre both gazing up at the ceiling bathed in after glow
marnie has obviously just had the sexual experience of her life
julius is equally dazed and happy
are you sure youve never done this before
i think i would have remembered
they start to kiss and we start to hear four raucous voices singing a great old rock song a capella
its our heroes singing
the cadillac is moving quickly through the extraordinary landscape
the caddy pulls up by a roadside flower stand
lets get her some flowers
one bunch from me one from jules
and one from us julius smiles happily at vinces thoughtfulness
in the mountains which dramatically tower over a lovely wide park like area with a large adobe building and a few smaller satellite huts
the car drives up a long dusty driveway to the entrance which is protected by high gates
our principals exit the car
they approach the fortress like gated entrance gazing around at the magnificent scenery
both men carry flowers and seem self conscious about the prospect of finally meeting their mother
its very beautiful isnt it vince
not to mention valuable real estate like this must be worth a fortune
a rebuke you mustnt always think of money
innocent you got me wrong im just saying its nice moms loaded thats a worry she wont have to have in her old age
julius smiles at vince and rings the bell
a male custodian answers the door friendly but very firm
can i help you
wed like to see miss mary anne benedict please
im afraid thats not possible
as he starts to close the door vince takes charge
weve come a long way
i can assure you shes going to be very happy to see us
i suggest you write a letter to the benedict foundation stating your business
the custodian politely closes the door in their faces
our principals circle the wall try a locked door to no avail
theyll have to go over
julius boosts marnie over the wall
linda boosts vince over
our principals take in the scene a large enclosed garden with pathways shady trees all very lovely with a great view of the sun setting against the surrounding mountains
their attention is drawn to a painter working at an easel
several young artists are gathered around her admiringly
this is happening underneath a beautiful old tree and the sight is just lovely
they stand still watching
indicating the bucolic scene you think its her
as they still stare well dont just stand there
as they take a step in the direction of the painter
sharp and loud hey
on her knees
shes in work clothes smudged hair in a bandana
maybe theres something terribly appealing about her
shes her own woman
she gets up from her knees now as they approach but not before we note the quality of her gardening its the size julius had back on the island
should you be here
tries to joke that depends on how you feel personally about trespassing
umamused to julius about vince is he always funny like that
very politely wed like to see mary ann benedict please is she here
course shes here shakes her head climbing over the wall like that i should call the police please dont do that look this isnt one of your average everyday situations
shes our mother is the thing
were her sons
youre comedians were kind of a surprise
takes off her gardening gloves ill bet you are follow me
she leads them towards the painter who glances up from her easel
whispering to julius we were right softly it is her now the gardener leads them past the painter
confused we thought that that woman is mary ann
no this is an artists colony theres a lot of painters
this is some chunk of real estate mom owns it all i guess
they are heading toward a door in the garden wall
you cant really own something like that view over there or that sunset can you
a believer no of course not
to linda and marnie i cant wait to meet her
this way please
the gardener ushers them towards a door in the garden wall
she opens it politely stands back letting them go through it
they turn back to look at her
mary anne benedict never understood why people wanted to buy her paintings
but for a brief period they were considered valuable
she used the money to buy whispering pines so that young artists would have a place to work
shes not famous anymore
she never wanted to be famous
she just wanted to be left alone
may i ask you a question
a beat concerned why do you keep referring to her in the past tense
because she passed away some time ago
they look like theyve been kicked in the stomach
but but you said she was here she is i meant her spirit
her spirit is always here
a beat excuse me
the gardener gently closes the door in their faces
they havent moved
linda and marnie try to console them
julius still doesnt move
vince shakes linda off and stomps away
vince out in front hurls his flowers to the ground kicks them then hurries toward the caddy
julius still carrying his bouquet picks up vinces flowers then places the two bouquets into a niche in the wall
marnie joins him and adds her flowers
the sound of the caddys horn honking
behind the wheel can we get the hell out of here
the gardener is back at work staking up her tomatoes as the female painter approaches her
what was that all about
these real estate developers wont be happy until they turn this place into a golf course
now theyre climbing over the walls
theyll try anything
bitterly amused those men claimed to be my twin sons if you can believe that
it was really quite disturbing
oh mary anne i am sorry
you get over things
with a sigh i did have a child once but he died at birth
julius vince linda and marnie are quietly sitting at a roadside table eating some junk food
you ought to be so proud of your mother vince
she donated her house and her land and all her paintings to help young artists
do i look like a young artist to you linda
gently vince all she meant was picking a fight i know what she meant
and i know why shes here too
its got nothing to do with my mother and everything to do with money
you know thats not true
hard bull shit
julius whos been quiet and distant throughout suddenly intercedes
take it easy vincent
its not her fault
you hear that everybody
the creature from the black lagoon just put in his two bits
i should have my head examined for listening to you in the first place deal of a lifetime opportunity and im driving around looking for a dead mother
very sad all i wanted was to make us into a family
stands up family my butt
theres no family here
theres just me and three losers im leaving
vince storms off gets into the caddy and squeals away throwing juliuss suitcase out the window as he goes
linda and marnie take off after him
vince quit acting crazy stunned he dumped us in the middle of new mexico
well be fine
and maybe hell be better off alone
you dont know hes got something worth maybe millions in that trunk he could get himself killed delivering it
hes been getting out of trouble all his life hes good at it
he may need you
voice flat dead i dont know much anymore on the island i was smart
here ive only made things worse
dont you realize you could make things a lot worse if you dont do something
gently close beside him now julius youre still very smart its just youre not thinking so well right now on account of what you found out at whispering pines but
youre not alone you know i mean you live long enough everyones mother dies
no reaction from julius
its impossible to tell what hes thinking
in the cadillac
hes driving very fast and is on the car phone
okay beetroot its time
ill be there tomorrow where do we meet and trade
thru thru julius is saying goodbye to linda and marnie
hes carrying his leather suitcase
to linda dont worry linda
i found him once ill find him again
julius gives marnie a rather chaste kiss
he turns away
spinning back grabbing her up folding her into his arms planting a world class kiss on her mouth
hold on the two of them
he puts on his sunglasses and strides into the airport
taking off in the new mexico sunset
the cadillac driving into town
hes real serious
with planes landing in the early morning behind him we see standing waiting trying to pick up the scent
julius strides purposefully along carrying his suitcase
he reaches a sign posted intersection looks in all di rections chooses one begins to move
as he does a creep starts walking along with him eyeing his suitcase just like the biker did when julius first arrived in hollywood
holds up cigarette got a light pal
julius without breaking stride turns his head looks at the creep
scary dont fuck with me
the creep falls back
vince pulls up in the caddy
he drives inside a large warehouse parks gets out and looks warily around
he opens the trunk unzips the sleeping bag revealing the merchandise
step away from that car mr
vince turns to see beetroot coming out of the warehouse accompanied by his bodyguard carrying an attache case and holding a gun
the bodyguard pats vince down
i thought we had a deal here
the bodyguard ignores him checks out the trunk
to beetroot this is it
this is what
to vince you come here alone unarmed
youre just a fool who stole a car arent you
its a new low cost fuel injection system for jet engines worth a fortune to the company that brings it to the market first
ruthlessly to bodyguard what are you waiting for
vince closes his eyes waiting for the bullet that he knows is coming
when he opens his eyes the bodyguard is holding the attache case open to show him the five million dollars
five million dollars sarcastic you wanna count it
i trust you
vince takes the case gazes at the money snaps it shut
he cant believe hes pulled it off
beetroot and the bodyguard get into the cadillac
the caddy speeds away while vince clutches the attache case to his chest and does a little dance of triumph
the big score at last
two shots ring out
vince freezes and sees the cadillac suddenly crashes against the side of another warehouse
its horn is blaring
emerges from the shadows with a powerful pump action shotgun
he opens the caddy and pushes the dead bodyguard off the horn
beetroot has a hole in his head as well
webster turns and gazes back toward vince who is sprinting for safety
webster calmly goes after him reloading his rifle
its filled with forklifts cranes and various forms of heavy machinery
webster enters and looks cautiously around
calling out all i want is the money benedict
just give me whats mine and you can go back to stealing cars and screwing your best friends wife
hiding behind some machinery scurries deeper into the bowels of the warehouse
moves forward stalking him
crawling along the ground
he spots an open window up ahead at the end of the warehouse
nearer to his right is another window closed
vince picks up a piece of pipe aims fires it at the closed window and as it breaks the glass firing at the sound
he cant see vince but he pours his fire at the window vince broke large chunks of the building explode off wherever webster fires
pack it in vince youre only wasting time i dont give a damn about you just the money hes reloaded during this moving forward as we
crouched near the open window glancing back at webster who has no idea where he is
noiselessly he slides out of the open window briefcase in hand starts to run away moving in on the shattered window
a bit irritated
vince if you dont cut this horseshit i may have to hurt you
over leave my brother alone
as webster whirls looks around twins rev
vince outside really chugging away now doing his best carl lewis imitation
julius looking down at webster from the floor above
his hands are held high
in one of them is a briefcase
ive got the money
gun trained on julius well dont be shy gesturing come on down
as vince puts distance between himself and the warehouse
suddenly he stops as if hes heard or felt something
he shakes the feeling off resumes running
and then stops again shuts his eyes tightly trying to deny whats happening to him
this is bullshit
eyes snapping open julius you putz
vince turns and runs back towards the warehouse
as julius gracefully shinnies down a cable lands near webster
he tosses the suitcase to the ground backs away
julius hands as before are held high over his head
just exactly who are you
vincents twin brother were in this together
keep your hands that way
dont be nervous i hate violence and i never carry guns
vince peering in through the window he jumped out of takes in the scene
muttering goddam esp psycho voodoo bullshit
opening julius suitcase
he pulls out julius old clothes tosses them aside then removes some books books and more books
disgusted shakespeares collected works
the mind of confucius
advanced quantum mechanics
what is this shit
i needed something to read on the airplane
raising rifle yeah well your flying days are over
flying through the air landing near websters feet
put the goddam gun away youre a multimillionaire
hands held high appears stands beside julius
he covers them both kneels opens vinces suitcase glances at the money inside
both with their hands up look at one another and begin arguing
i am never going to forgive you for this
you were going to get killed
i tried to distract him so you could escape
i had escaped
i was on my way to brazil when i felt you
so why didnt you go
because thanks to you im now not only a godamn psychic ive got this disease called a conscience
nobody ever said being good was easy
webster uneasily monitors their argument
how am i going to survive out there
what are my friends going to think
smiling you havent got any friends
just what are you two talking about
to webster butt out okay
this is family stuff were squabbling its personal just take the money and go sit in the lap of luxury somewhere
cocking his shotgun i doesnt work like that you might talk to people aiming the rifle now who wants it first
this whole thing is his fault
whatever you want
hold it dont i get a say in this
webster points the shotgun at vince starts to squeeze the trigger when pulls a gun from his sleeve and blows websters weapon out of his hands
webster screams in pain clutching his hand dancing around
amazed you can be an irritating pain but sometimes you come in handy
whered you get the gun
from the dead man in the car
to webster you should have checked if he had a gun chump
he said he didnt believe in them
proudly i lied
teasing ooooh you lied
i had to
vince beams with deep fraternal pride
then he turns to webster and snatches the case back
looks like you messed with the wrong people wise guy
webster shrugs and takes out a cigarette
you got lucky
he lights it with his lighter
suddenly julius smells something
smiling but your luck just ran out
a stream of gas is pouring out of the drums that webster punctured whilst he was shooting at vince
it runs in a broad stream across the warehouse floor right beneath julius and vinces feet
webster is holding his cigarette out ready to drop it in the fuel and incin erate them
drop the gun and give me back the case or were gonna have ourselves some barbecued benedict
julius drops the gun and vince slowly hands back the case
webster smiles and backs off down the stream of gas still holding out the cigarette
he stops at the very edge of the building
well i guess this is goodbye
he raises the cigarette ready to throw it
wait a minute
webster looks up
youve forgotten something
webster grips the case tighter
i dont think so
the third rule in a crisis situation
julian leans calmly against the warehouse wall supported by one arm
the third rule
juliuss hand has pressed a button in a metal cage
suddenly the load hanging from the boom of a nearby crane smashes into websters back and then dumps on him burying him in rubble
even more amazed duck
cant believe it duck
you are developing real style julius
drapes his arm around vince as they walk towards the unharmed attache case full of money
you came back for me
yeah yeah yeah
i always knew you would
youre my brother right
as julius smiles were family right
thank you vincent
with a gleam were a rich family right
both reach for the attache case at the same time
were a good family
im sorry vince but we have to return the money
return the money
are you nuts
this is dirty money julius it doesnt belong to anybody including us think how much better youll feel when its out of our lives almost jumping up and down i
wont i wont feel one bit better ill never feel better not if i live to be
oh no as the sound of police sirens get louder we thru thru a large photo of vince and julius being handed a check with an accompanying headline that reads
camera pulls back to reveal we are mary anne benedict seated at a breakfast table stares at the newspaper in astonishment
its being held in front of her by the painter from the earlier scene who gently places the newspaper into mary annes hands
i think youd better read this
traven is reading a newspaper with his feet up on the desk
it has the same headline and photo
you stole my family you lying son of a bitch
traven looks up just as mary annes fist comes crashing into his face and sends him flying
t twins rev
as linda comes through the door gets her mail from the mailbox
she turns and comes face to face with vince standing there with a contrite look on his face
linda i what the hell are you doing here
you wouldnt answer my calls or my letters so i
look i made a terrible mistake and i apologize and i want to tell you that im a changed man
linda is almost buying it but then how did you get in here
well there was a window in the back that resigned again typical
she walks past him approaches her door puts in the key
vince follows speaking softly his sincerity absolutely genuine
all i ask is for another chance
i know i probably dont deserve it but youre right you dont deserve it
she opens her door walks in and slams it in his face
she sighs turns from the door and sees t twins rev
dozens of them everywhere all over her apartment beautifully arranged in gorgeous vases
taking it all in her resistance melting
she turns flings open the door looks out no sign of vince
until camera tilts down to reveal vince on his knees
i had to break into your apartment but vince theyre beautiful
so do you forgive me
vince looks at her understands
you mean that matter we talked about once and never really resolved
feigning ignorance what matter is that
the matter of you and me living together
haltingly what about it
vince gets to his feet
your place or mine
they rush into each others arms
t twins rev
it reads the benedict corporation
camera pulls back to reveal we are inside vinces office
the offices have been redecorated they look serious professional and are filled with computer terminals and other high tech equipment
julius is sorting through a stack of mail while vince talks to a prospective client on the phone
both of them are wearing suits and ties
into phone what do we do
most people on this planet cause problems the benedict corporation solves them
were a consulting firm a think tank sort of like the rand corporation only smarter
a beat tuesday at three
see you then
vince hangs up the phone loosens his tie
julius excitedly holds up a stack of letters
look at this vince proposals from the red cross unicef the world health organization we should only have clients who do humanitarian work
just as long as they pay were not running a charity you know
the sound of footsteps down the corridor then a tentative knock at the door
as it opens revealing mary anne benedict not looking at all like the gardener they met in whispering pines
confused just look at her for a moment
o twins rev
clearly overwhelmed struggles to find the appropriate words
its so incredible im not even sure which one of you is which
look at one another then at mary anne realizing at the same time that shes their mother
staring at each other in silence until you see i didnt believe you i mean who would believe a story like your story crazy they lied to me all these
and they lied to you
but you found one another and you found me
please god one of you say something
mary anne nods
she nods again
anguished wail they both run to mary anne and hug her for all shes worth
theyre laughing crying holding each other
u twins rev
now there are tears on his face too
he goes to them gently puts his arms around them lifts them both up in to the air cradling them
theyre holding each other
no words are necessary
thru thru smiling happily
pull back to reveal we are in front of the merry go round
werner purchases a hand ful of tickets from the vendor hands one each to mary anne linda and marnie
i just cant get over how alike they are
the three women all turn and gaze affectionately back at walking along the path behind them
we assume its them the women were discussing until we notice that each of them is pushing a double stroller with identical twin babies inside
its the twin children that are the source of the womens wonder and vince and julius as well
vince and julius both yawn simultaneously
they kepp you up all night again too
u twins rev
sceaming in stereo
they both stop the strollers look down lovingly at their kids begin fondling them
vince and julius simultan eously flip identical baby rattles and shake them at their twins
to baby i think you need your diaper changed
to baby what a surprise so do you
vince becomes aware of the condition of his kids diapers
checks his babies not you too its not a competition you know
they both start pushing their strollers again
just think what wed be like if wed been raised together
now thats a scary thought
they both yawn simultaneously once again
vince and julius are sitting on adjoining horses
linda and marnie hand their sons up to them watched proudly by mary anne
the merry go round starts moving and the last image we see is of vince and julius on the horses holding their twin sons
