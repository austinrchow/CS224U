a pretty young woman is standing on the street corner waiting for a bus
shes carrying books and looking very collegiate
a black stretch limousine with darkened windows drives past slams on its brakes and backs up
the young woman stares at her reflection in the windows wondering what this is all about
finally the rear passenger window zips down revealing lloyd christmas age
hes a pleasant enough looking guy if a little shaggy
hes wearing a dark suit
excuse me can you tell me how to get to the medical school
im supposed to be giving a lecture in twenty minutes and my drivers a bit lost
heavy european accent go straight aheads and makes a left over za bridge
lloyd checks out her body
i couldnt help noticing the accent
you from jersey
mock australian accent well gday mate
what do you say we get together later and throw a few shrimp on the barbie
the young woman turns her back to him and walks away
to self guess i wont be going down under tonight
he sighs and zips the window back up
lloyd climbs through the drivers partition into the front seat
then he puts a chauffeurs cap on his head and drives away
we see that hes the driver
the dispatch radio crackles to life v
carr come in car
lloyd grabs his cb mike
where the hell are you lloyd
youre running late on the east side pick up
cool your jets arnie
im on my way
well hurry it up
and make sure you park legally
one more ticket and your ass is history
this building is white with black spots on it like a dalmation
over the front door is an awning shaped like a dogs snout whiskers included
a van pulls up outside
the vehicle is decorated like a giant poodle with four legs hanging off the sides a tail in the rear and a dogs snout on the front grill
mutt cuts is written on the side of it
harry dunne climbs out
hes in his early s and dressed in a ridiculous beagle costume including a cap with floppy ears
he goes to the rear of the van opens it and a swarm of dogs pile out
okay gang single file
you know the rules no pushing no humping and no sniffing heinies
the door to the shop opens and harrys annoyed boss mr
palmer sticks his head out
hey why arent those mutts on leashes
the same reason youre not on a leash sir because its demeaning and it chafes like hell
just get them in here now
they all have to be bathed and clipped in an hour
palmer disappears back inside
harry calls to the dogs but they pay no attention
he struggles to keep them from wandering off
he grabs a couple of small pooches and sits them on a wall
you kids stay right here
as he turns to round up the other we discover that the wall isnt a wall its a flatbed truck
the truck drives away taking the two dogs with it
at truck hey wait a minute
harry chases after the vehicle
lloyd christmas pulls the limousine into a long tree lined driveway
he gets out and looks up in awe at an impressive stone mansion
he whistles to himself then walks to the front oor and rings the bell
the double front doors of the mansion open and mary swanson appears
shes and gorgeous
lloyds jaw drops open when he lays eyes on her
beat ill be just a minute
as mary steps back inside lloyd takes out a tiny can of binaca
he sprays his mouth under his arms his hair behind his ears
lloyd is driving and mary is in the back looking out the window lost in thought
shes got a briefcase resting on her lap and she fingers the leather nervously
lloyd keeps glancing at her in the rear view mirror but for a moment he is speechless
then why you going to the airport
dead pan howd you guess
well i saw your luggage then when i noticed the airline ticket i put two and two together
beat so where you heading
oh youre gonna love it
i hear californias beautiful this time of year
mary looks back out the window and lloyd sneaks another glance
on lloyd we can almost see his mind work
hes desperate to impress her
uh this isnt my real job you know
its only temporary
yeah you see my friend harry and i are saving up our money so we can open our own pet store
smiling i got worms
i beg your pardon
thats what were gonna call it i got worms
were gonna specialize in selling worm farms you know like ant farms
a lot of people dont realize that worms make much better pets than ants
theyre quiet affectionate they dont bite and theyre super with the kids
arent ants quiet too
lloyd realizes she has a point
well sure but they arent half as affectionate
and if you cut an ants head off it wont grow back
and best of all worm farming is a seventy five thousand dollar a year industry
i wouldnt mind having a piece of that pie if you know what i mean
to her credit she doesnt
they continue driving
mary looks at her watch and crosses her legs
lloyd can see that shes concerned about something
whats the matter
little tense about the flight
beat something like that
lloyd swivels around and stares over his shoulder at her
its really nothing to worry about mary
statistically they say youre more likely to get killed on the way to the airport
you know like in a head on crash or something
um lloyd could please keep your eyes on the road
theres a lot of bad rivers out there
lloyd turns back to the steering wheel
lloyd is putting the last bags on a cart
he closes the trunk and turns to mary
she looks nervous and disconcerted as she reaches into her purse
she pulls out a ten dollar tip
here you go
it was my pleasure
for the first time mary swanson offers a slight smile
this makes her more lovely than ever
just get trashed and pass out
youll be there before you know it
beat and good luck with your worms
then she picks up her briefcase and walks into the terminal followed by a porter pushing her bags
lloyd watches her enchanted until shes out of sight
afterwards he climbs back into the limo lovesick
for a moment he doesnt even have the energy to turn the key
he just drops his head against the steering wheel devastated
theres a tap on the window
lloyd looks up to see a police officer standing there
come on move it youre in a red zone
lloyd starts the limo and pulls away
mary looks tense as she moves through the throngs of travelers
her pace is slow deliberate and her eyes are focused straight ahead
she passes a row of phone botths and two men one dressed in an armani suit the other in a plaid sportcoat watch her
shes gonna leave the briefcase at the foot of the escalator
you make the pick up
piece of cake
as lloyd pulls his limo slowly away he glances in the airport window and sees mary when she stops at the foot of the escalator he stops too
she puts down the briefcase and checks her coat pocket for her ticket
lloyds attention is distracted by a honk
he turns to see a car irectly behind him
to cars driver drive around me you pinhead
when he turns back to watch mary in the terminal he sees that shes gone and shes left her briefcase at the foot of the stairs
lloyd jumps to attention
he pulls the car into a handicapped spot and hops out
he starts to run into the terminal then notices the police officer and suddenly goes into a spastic walk limping and dragging him leg behind him like a palsy victim
the armani man nods to the plaid sportcoat and he starts to approach the briefcase
just as plaid sportcoat is reaching for the handle lloyd runs by and grabs it
he continues up the escalator three steps at a time
the two men look at each other dumbstruck
lloyd runs with the briefcase to the tv monitors that post the departure times
he looks frantically at the confusion of numbers
quick cut of a dejected lloyd looking out the window as he watches as marys airplane taxiing away
lloyd comes out with the briefcase passing the two men who follow him at a distance
he starts walking down the sidewalk when suddenly he stops in his tracks
his pov his limo is being towed away under the supervision of the police officer
he takes off after it but to no avail
you cant do this
ill lose my job
as lloyd watches the limo get towed out of site he runs his fingers through his hair
we see the mutt cuts van pull up and park at the curb
a dejected harry climbs out
at the same time a taxi pulls up and drops off lloyd
hes clutching mary swansons briefcase
both he and harry climb the steps of the building
they disappear inside without acknowledging each other
on the other side of the street a black cadillac pulls up and parks
inside are the armani suit and the sportcoat
they are j
shay and joseph mentalino aka joe who the hell do you figure this guys working for
i dont know but wed better find out
mental takes some pills and starts chomping them
it aint gonna kill me
lloyd and harry trudge up the stairs and proceed silently toward the door of their apartment
lloyd and harry enter and pass each other quietly as they both plunk down in their favorite easy chairs
lloyd still has the briefcase in his lap
harrys caged parakeet petey tweets hello but the two guys just sit there silently
the place is a mess
wallpapers peeling off the walls
the carpet is threadbare and filthy
in the corner we see a miniature worm farm and a large terrarium filled with dirt and worms
here are a couple pieces of haggard furniture with stuffing spilling out of the gashes
i got fired again
lloyd shakes his head
i dont mean to be harsh harry but lets face it you are one pathetic loser
were you shitcanned too
of course not
beat i quit
whyd you quit
i had a hunch arnie was gonna fire me
why didnt you wait and see if your suspicions were well founded
winners control their own destiny har
lloyd fetches a couple beers from the fridge and throws one to him
you know the thing that really chaps my ass is that i just spent my life savings turning my van into a poodle
beat the alarm alone cost me two hundred
that cars an old bomb anyway
what are you talking about
its only six years old
thats forty two in dog years
they open their beers and drink simultaneously
then harry notices the briefcase
whats with the briefcase
its a love memento
the most beautiful woman alive
her name was mary
i drove her to the airport
sparks flew emotions ran high breasts heaved
she left this case in the terminal and flew to aspen and out of my life
end of story
whats in it
do you really expect me to go snooping around in someone elses private property
beat its locked
they take another sip of their beers
suddenly we hear a loud knock at the door
petey the parakeet starts to squawk
the guys look at each other alarmed then harry tip toes to the harrys pov a distorted looking j
shay and joe mental are standing at the door
whispering to harry friend or foe
we dont have any friends
harry is still squinting out the peephole
cant recognize them
could be student loan thugs again or the irs or maybe somebody pissed off about that case of girl scout cookies you bounced a check on
hey i ordered mystic mint
the little swindlers gave me peanut butter praline
well whoever they are they look serious
one of thems even wearing plaid
cringing thats a hostile pattern
i say we bail and get down to unemployment
lloyd grabs the briefcase and the two of them exit out the window and down the fire escape
the poodle van pulls up to the curb in front of the building and parks next to a fire hydrant
lloyd and harry climb out
lloyd takes a trash can and places it over the stanley grabner is small plump balding not a lot of laughs
gentlemen im delighted to say that neither i nor the unemployment epartment of the state of rhose island can do anything for you
beat youve run out of chances
remember last year
middle of winter i busted my butt to fifty an hour and you went and blew it
for your information we only missed three days in two months
yeah and that was because of a blizzard
exploding grabner falls back in his chair exhausted
come on stan
im sure you can find something else for us
how about another crack at that suicide hotline
grabner jumps up
shay is looking through harry and lloyds kitchen cupboards as joe mental comes out of the bedroom
the briefcase aint here
he mustve taken it with him
beat well hes gotta come home sometime
joe mental ominously approaches petey the parakeets cage
maybe we should leave him a little message to let em know were playing hardball
mental opens the cage door and wraps his meaty fist around the bird who screeches in a la tweety bird i taut i taw a puddy cat
mental smiles and as we pan to j
shay we hear a bone chilling o
snap and petey the bird stops squawking
still tweety i did i did
the mutt cuts van pulls up to the curb
a depressed lloyd and harry climb out and mope up to their apartment building entrance
give me whats left of our dough
ill go to the corner and buy a few necessities
harry hands his friend some crumpled bills
whats cheaper thunderbird or night train
get robitussin its a better buzz
lloyd comes out of the store with his arms full of groceries
he stops at a newspaper machine pulls out his wallet and removes a quarter
he drops the quarter in the machine opens it and realizes that he doesnt have a free hand to pick up the newspaper
he puts his wallet inside the machine picks up the newspaper and as he does so the machine slams shut with his wallet lloyd sighs puts his grocery bags on
the machine and checks his pockets
no more change
just then an elderly woman struggles by using a walker
excuse me little old lady do you have change for a dollar
no im sorry i dont
well could you do me a favor and guard this while i go break a dollar
my wallets locked in this machine
of course young man
lloyd runs back into the store
we hold on the store door as lloyd exits a few seconds later with a handful of quarters
suddenly he stops in his tracks
the elderly lady her walker and his groceries are gone
as he takes a closer look he sees that a thoroughly beleaguered lloyd is trudging empty handed up the steps to his apartment
the door opens and lloyd enters
harry is sitting on the couch looking almost comatose
wheres the booze
i got robbed by grandma walton
she got my wallet too
harry drops his head and lets out a moan
come on man cheer up
weve been own before
im sure well land on our heads somewhere
it gets worse lloyd
my parakeet petey hes
lloyd looks touched by this
oh man im sorry harry
his head fell off
his head fell off
yeah he was pretty old
lloyd puts his hand on harrys shoulder compassionately
hopeful i dont suppose he had a warranty
nah i bought him used
as lloyd thinks about the unfairness of life he grows upset
ive had it with this ump
we dont have food we dont have jobs our pets heads are falling off were surrounded by roving gangs of larcenous old okay calm down
no i wont calm down
lloyd flops down in a chair
what the hell are we doing here anyway harry
weve got to get out of this town
yeah and go where
ill tell you where someplace warm a place where the beer flows like wine where beautiful women instinctively flock like the salmon of capistrano
dramatic pause im talking about aspen
thats right aspen
i dont know lloyd the french are assholes
let me ask you something do you want to end up like petey dead in some flea ridden apartment face down on a dear abby column with a soggy sunflower
seed pressed against your beak
or do you want to enjoy your life
beat come on harry dont let peteys eath be in vain
dont you see what he was saying
spread your wings man
he was saying
spread your wings man
confused what are you talking about lloyd
his head fell off
dawning realization wait a second i know what youre up to
you just wanna go to aspen so you can find that girl who lost her briefcase and you need me to drive you there
beat and whats so wrong about going someplace where we know someone who can plug us into the social pipeline
torn i dont know lloyd
i think we should stay here hunt for jobs and keep saving money for the worm store
im getting a little sick and tired of always running from creditors
lloyd moves to the window and looks out at the gray wintry cityscape
you know what im sick and tired of harry
im sick and tired of having to eek my way through life
im sick and tired of being a nobody
beat but most of all im sick and tired of having nobody
theres a deadly silence as they both think about this
then harry tries to lighten the mood
he opens his arms wide
come on lloyd
give us a kiss
on the other hand maybe youre right harry
maybe we should stay here and try our luck in bankruptcy court
with all those lawsuits against us im sure well win at least one
it could be a boost to our egos
harry sees that lloyd has a point
he stands and approaches peteys cage
his eyes fill with tears
emotional petey i made a promise to you once man
thinking hard and ill be damned if i can remember what it was
the mutt cutts van is going down the highway while danny wilsons marys prayer plays on the soundtrack
the van drives past and we hold on a sign that reads you are leaving shots of the car travelling down the road while the song continues to play
harrys behind the wheel and lloyds in the passenger seat
the animals weve got to get out of this place is blasting on the radio and the guys are singing along
weve got to get out of this place if its the last thing we ever do weve got to get out of this place girl theres a better life for
me and you
lloyd turns down the radio
well were finally doing it
do you realize that in all the years weve known each other this is the first time weve done this together
been run out of town
taken a trip
harry reaches over and undoes his seatbelt
lloyd watches curious
whyd you do that
take your seatbelt off
because we just cleared the danger zone
dont you know anything lloyd
ninety percent of all accidents happen within five miles of home
weve already traveled
well what about the people who live around here
what if we got into an accident with one of them
harry considers this then sheepishly puts his seatbelt back on
lloyd opens a bag of doritos and fiddles with the radio
whered you get those
bought em when we filled up
lloyd i thought we agreed to confer on all expenditures
were on a tight budget remember
this didnt come out of our travel fund
i was able to scrape up twenty five bucks before we left
you know so we could live in style
whered you get twenty five extra bucks
i sold some stuff to billy in c
you mean the blind kid
lloyd looks out the window guiltily
what did you sell him lloyd
just some odds and ends
oh a few baseball cards a sack of marbles petey three comic books a second are you telling me you sold my dead bird to a blind kid
well who else was i gonna sell it to
but lloyd petey didnt even have a head
put your mind at ease friend
i took care of it
at the bottom of the stairs leading up to the building is a little blind boy billy
he sits in a wheelchair playing with a parakeet whose head is scotch taped on
he throws the ead bird up but it flops into his lap
joe mental and j
shay approach and climb the steps
close on a note taped to harry and lloyds apartment door
it reads to all our pullback to reveal joe mental and j
theyre rubbing it right in our faces
andre will have a goddamn aneurysm if we dont get that briefcase back
dont worry well get it back
and ill tell you something else
they aint gonna reach aspen either
ill make sure of that
mental takes out more antacid pills and starts to chew on them
a pissed off shay and mental exit the building
mental pops more antacid pills into his mouth as they descend the stairs
little billy is still tossing the lifeless parakeet into the air
come on boy fly
then billy hears shay and mental on the steps and calls excuse me mister
is there something wrong with my bird
mental picks up the bird studies it then angrily and wings it down the street as hard as he can
dont worry ironside he just flew south for the winter
harry is still driving while lloyd studies a map spread out before him
how far have we gone
according to this map about an inch and a half
were gonna need a smaller map or well never get there
we dont have enough gas money
we have more than enough
i believe youre wrong lloyd
and i believe im right harry
i still say wrong lloyd
how much you wanna bet
i dont bet
lloyd looks at his friend incredulous
what do you mean you dont bet
i mean i dont gamble you know that
never have and never will
ill bet you our next meal that i can get you gambling before the days out
theres no way lloyd
you cant do it
ill give you three to one odds
thats three feedbags if you win against only one if you lose
youre wasting your money lloyd
i already told you i dont gamble
okay five to one i can get you gambling before the days out
sorry pal no way
make it ten to one
harry sticks out his hand
you got yourself a bet sucker
as harry shakes lloyds hand lloyd breaks into a big smile
harry immediately realizes hes been had
the mutt cutt van is sandwiched between mountainous tractor trailer trucks
lloyd and harry are sitting at a booth surrounded by tables of tough looking truckers
harry oesnt look happy
a middle aged no nonsense waitress approaches their table with a couple of burgers and drinks
she puts them down in front of the boys and starts to walk away
to waitress the waitress reluctantly returns to the table
whats the soup du jour
its the soup of the day
ill have a bowl
sarcastic anything else before i leave the area
actually this chocolate milk isnt mixed very well
could you please bring me a spoon
the waitress sighs and picks up the milk
then she blows there
now you dont need one
the guys watch her stomp away
back country folk dont it harry
harry wipes off his straw with a napkin
as he moves to put it in the ashtray he accidentally
whats the matter
you spilled the salt
thats bad luck
were driving across the country and the last thing we need is bad luck
quick toss a handful of salt over your right shoulder
because thats good luck
harry shrugs shakes some salt into his palm and flings it over his shoulder
suddenly they hear a o
what the fuck
or was it the left shoulder
they turn and see a burly trucker wiping salt out of his eyes
whos the dead man threw shit in my eye
the huge trucker stands and squints at lloyd and harry
hes wearing a foam baseball cap that says wine em dine em it was a terrible accident sir
believe me i would never do anything to offend a man of your size
please accept my most sincere apology
the trucker growls and approaches the table egged on by his equally burly friends
teach him a lesson sea bass
sea bass glares down at harrys hamburger
you gonna eat that
the thought had crossed my mind
at this sea bass leans over and drops a big brown wad of still want it
harry stares at the burger non commitally
nah you go ahead
sea bass picks up the burger and walks back to his table to the laughter of his friends
shay is at the gas pump filling the black cadillac while joe mental stretches his legs
a large truck pulls away revealing the previously hidden mutt cutts van
mental smiles at this and we the waitress drops the check on lloyd and harrys table and stomps away
harry studies the bill and sighs
im out eight bucks and i still havent eaten
well if youd stop picking fights with the locals
brightening wait a second
i think i just had an idea
lloyd stands and walks over to sea bass and his pals
a nervous harry trails after him
excuse me gentlemen id just like to apologize for that unpleasant scene a little earlier
what im trying to say is my friend and i would like to buy you guys a round of beers just to bury the hatchet
harry stares at lloyd like hes out of his mind but the truckers seem to like the idea
make it four boiler makers
whatever you want sir
ill have the waitress send them over
oh and fellas hope to see you again down the road
lloyd and harry move away from the table toward the cashier
lloyd what are you doing
you know we cant afford to buy them drinks
lloyd hands the cashier their check
um sea bass and the fellas offered to pick up our check
they said just add this to their tab
skeptical sea bass said that
well if that guy at the table over there is sea bass
he points across the room to sea bass and company
sea bass to miss out on his free drink
the cashier is convinced
okey dokey if thats what he wants
harry smiles at this
he grabs a couple beef jerkys a candy bar and a copy of the national enquirer off the counter
oh and put these on there too
you got it
to cashier by the way how far is it to rhode island from here
the front door bursts open and a red faced sea bass storms out followed by his buddies the cashier and the waitress
im gonna kill those sons of bitches
hurry and youll catch em
they was on their way to rhode island
the truckers jump in their rigs and rumble away in the opposite direction our boys are headed
the mutt cutts van breezes by
a jubilant harrys driving and chewing on a mouthful of beef jerky
i just wish we couldve seen sea basss face when he got the bill
i hope we never have to
that fish head is probably half way to providence by now
i hope so
harry checks his rear view mirror nervously
hey stop the car
i gotta take a whiz
are you crazy
im not stopping now
what if they figure out we went the other way
theyll be on us in no time
but i gotta go
what am i supposed to do
i cant hold it
im about to explode
just take a whiz in an empty beer bottle
theres a couple on the floor in the back seat
are you serious
yes im serious
im not stopping now
we could get killed
he takes an empty beer bottle from the back seat and unzips his fly
suddenly we hear a peeing sound
then uh oh
whats the matter
the bottles almost full and im still going
well stop going
i cant stop once i already started you know that
quick get me another bottle
harry can barely hold the steering wheel as he reaches way in the back seat for an empty
jesus be careful
you almost went off the road
im sorry lloyd
im doing the best i can
he hands lloyd another empty and lloyd quickly makes the switch
here hold this
before harry knows it hes holding the full bottle of urine
as the mutt cutts van travels down the highway it passes a state trooper on a motorcycle hidden in the bushes
the trooper takes off after them
harry is doing his best to steer while now holding five full bottles and lloyd is still going at it in the passenger seat
what are you a goddamn camel
hey i havent gone all day
just then they hear a loudspeaker o
they turn to see the police motorcycle cruising right beside then
harry rolls down his window and calls out huh
harry glances down at his sweater hes wearing then back at the trooper
calling out no its a cardigan
but thanks for noticing
he rolls his window back up and turns to an equally baffled lloyd
jesus what is this the fashion police
the cop turns on his siren
the state trooper is walking up beside the stopped mutt cutts van staring at it with isapproval
license and registration please
harry hands him the papers
you know you fellas were all over the road back there
yes sir we had a little
ifficulty in the car
beat have you boys been doing a little rinking maybe
then whats that
he points to the open full beer bottles hidden in the seat between them
oh thats nothing sir
do you know its against the law to rive with an open alcohol container in this state
but your honor hes telling the truth
its not beer
the officer smirks
is that right
the trooper reaches in and picks up one of the bottles
he inspects the beer label then moves sir i wouldnt trooper youd keep your mouth shut if you knew what was good for you
under breath harry shoots lloyd a look as the trooper begins gulping down the piss
he pauses uncertainly and a sick look comes over his face
he takes a deep breath
then pained get the hell out of here
the mutt cutts van is pulling back onto the highway while the officer remains in the breakdown lane with his hands on his knees
the van is making steady progress through the dark night
lloyd is driving now while harry sleeps in the passenger seat
the song cut flowers by the smithereens starts to play as lloyd fantasizes about his future in aspen
lloyd is walking up the steps of a luxurious snow covered chalet carrying marys briefcase
the sky is absurdly blue and children are making a snowman on the lawn
its all out of a dream world
he knocks on the door tentatively
mary opens it
she looks at him then at the briefcase and breaks into the biggest sweetest smile hes ever seen
then she slowly backs into the house gesturing for him to follow
lloyd follows mary down a hallway
as he trails after her she pulls off her shirt revealing her bare back and glances over her shoulder at him
camera moves around a corner and now were in a steamy bathroom
the shower is running and we see the silhouette of two people behind the curtain
how does that feel lloyd
close on lloyd we see hes taking the tegrin challenge with different shampoos on either side of his head and a noticeable part down the middle
hows the other side
nothing at all
lloyd will you wash my nipples
on mary her hair is slicked back making her look better than ever
as the camera pans down toward her breasts we are surprised to see not breasts but a set of headlights superimposed over her chest area
the headlights flash once
on lloyd he blinks confused at whats happening
jump cut to an eighteen wheeler is roaring right toward the mutt cutts van on the highway
lloyd quickly veers back into his lane and avoids tragedy by a whisker
a shaken lloyd lets out a sigh of relief and we the mutt cutts van is parked outside this seedy establishment
a neon sign blinks group v
i dont know lloyd i feel a little sleazy staying here when were not even engaged
hey its the only motel that charges by the hour
we cant afford anything else
lloyd and harry are sitting in a large heart shaped jacuzzi
lloyd is sipping a beer and harry is absorbed in the enquirer as the water swirls around them
yep this sure is the life
cold beer a hot tube and fuzzy pink sheets
you know theres only one thing that could make this moment any better
if you had a nice set of knockers
thats two things lloyd
right now id settle for one
lloyd takes a swig of beer
harry puts down the paper and looks around at the romantic decor
i dont know lloyd these places just dont do it for me
brings back too many memories
what happened harry
some little filly break your heart
nah it was a girl
we stayed at a place like this once no tell motel out on route
you mean the babe who worked for the tractor company
we had this incredibly romantic time
boy i thought wed be together forever
then about a week later right out of the blue she sends me a john deere letter
thats cold har
give you any reason
i called her up and she gave me some crap about me not listening to her enough or something like that
i wasnt really paying attention
harry reaches for a beer and busts it open
he takes a big gulp
thing that really hurts is i think she was seeing another guy
never id find out who
on lloyd he does his best to hide his guilt
we see that the black cadillac is parked a few cars over from the mutt cutts van with j
shay in the passenger seat
pan over to a payphone
inside is joe mental
outside the booth an anxious man impatiently paces back and forth as he waits for the phone
into phone the boys are holed up in a little love nest for the night
i think theyre a couple of fucking weirdos
nicholas andre is pacing around the room with a cordless phone
hes in his late s wears a ponytail and dresses in aspen rodeo drive chic
what in hell are those guys up to
is it possible that theyre feds
unlikely from what ive seen
the anxious man taps on the phone booth and motions for mental to hang up
i dont like this one goddamn bit mental
you and shay were supposed to grab that bag so we could end this shit
now i dont know what the hells going on
andre sighs and wipes some perspiration from his upper lip
the anxious man knocks on the booth again
hold on a second mr
mental puts the phone down and motions the anxious man closer to the booth
the man moves forward a few inches
mental motions him even closer
when hes about a foot away mental punches his hand through the glass of the booth and knocks the anxious man out cold
then mental picks up the phone again
you were saying
look mental just find out what theyre up to
i want to know who these guys are
im on it
mental hangs up the phone looks around to make sure hes not being watched then approaches the parked mutt cutt van
hes joined by j
as they get within five feet of the vehicle we hear a low growl
they stop in their tracks and turn expecting to see a dog but there isnt one
they both take another step forward and the growl gets louder and meaner
again mental and shay stop
he peeks under the car
what the fuck
finally shay reaches for the door handle
as soon as he touches it though the car alarm goes off but instead of a siren its the incredibly annoying sound of a poodle yapping
mental jumps back and pulls his gun
wheres the goddamn dog
shay shrugs nervous
the yapping grows even louder now forcing a flustered shay and mental to retreat from the scene
establishing shot of a luxurious mountainside home
an agitated mary swanson the young woman who lost her briefcase is pacing back and forth in younger second wife helen
it just doesnt make any sense
i left the money exactly where they instructed me to
actually it makes a great deal of sense mary
we should have called in the authorities the moment we knew melvin had been kidnapped
now helen weve been through this already for christs sake karl these bastards will extort us into bankruptcy if we let them
but id never forgive myself if something happened to melvin
stop upsetting my daughter helen
shes been through quite enough already
its not her fault daddy
were all a little on edge
just then the living room door opens and the pony tailed nicholas andre enters
he looks appropriately solemn
has there been any word mr
nothing yet nicholas
andre looks upset
perhaps i should call off the preservation benefit this weekend
no nicholas its imperative that we carry on as usual
the atmosphere in the room couldnt be more somber
karl swanson holds his hand out to his aughter
dont worry sweetheart
ill do everything they ask
nothings going to happen to melvin i promise you
thank you daddy
karl swanson looks out the window concerned
the black cadillac pulls over to the side of the road
joe mental gets out of the car and props the hood open
he takes out his gun slides in a new clip and puts it back in his pocket
to shay lie down on the front seat
after they pick me up i want you to follow us
then he folds his arms and the two killers wait for the van to come along
lloyd taps harrys shoulder
harry taps lloyd back
lloyd immediately taps harry
tapping him back anti quitsies
no anti quitsies
lloyd shakes his head defeated
damn youre good harry
beat hey didnt i tell you this trip would be a blast
joe mental squints down the road sees the mutt cutts van approaching and starts waving his hands to flag them down
through the windshield we can see mental waving
the guys dont slow down through
the just wave back as they blow right by him
harry also toots the horn which makes the see i told you these country folks were friendly harry
as an angry mental watches them disappear down the road shay sits up in the front seat
these fuckers are really pissing me off now
we hear the zombies time of the season as the van flashes by
refresh my memory on something lloyd what exactly do we do when we get to aspen
well the first thing we do is take a good deep breath of that famous aspenese air
they say on any day of the week you can smell a moose fart ten miles away
talk about paradise
beat and after were finished breathing what next lloyd
then we make a splash on the social scene
just then lloyd notices something up the road
harry look the golden arches
pull over im starving
the mutt cutt car is at the drive through window
thats two cheese burgers two fries and two medium cokes
five seventy two
harry hands a ten dollar bill to the employee who returns a handful of change
then before he can give them the bag of food the guys absentmindedly drive off
as they pull out of the parking lot the mcdonalds employee sticks his head out the window and waves the bag of food at them
but the guys are already around the corner
the mutt cutt van is on the road again cruising along
about this social scene how do you expect a couple mutts like us to make a splash in the land of pedigrees when we dont even have any money
look once we drop the briefcase off to mary shell be so grateful shell plug us right into the party circuit
after that we do a little of the ski rubbers and walk out of there in the spring with enough business connections to open a first class worm operation
you see you dont get rich working harry
you get rich knowing the rich
whered you hear that
some bum down at unemployment
harry thinks about this
i dont know lloyd
whats the matter
money does terrible things to people
i mean we could lose our friendship
lloyd thinks about this
harry nods and looks out the window
suddenly something dawns hey wait a second
arent you forgetting something
harry thinks about this
back at mickey ds
a little matter you mightve overlooked
harry wracks his brain but to no avail
lloyd rolls his eyes
as a sheepish harry gives lloyd his change they notice something up ahead
this time the cadillac is parked sideways across i think this guys in trouble
why ont you pull over
lloyd looks at harry
harry remembers that hes driving
he pulls the car to the side of the road
mental approaches the passenger window
you guys going as far as des moines
my car died and im late for a business meeting
theyre back on the highway and joe mental is sitting between them looking extremely annoyed
the guys are in the middle of an argument
its a fruit
its a vegetable
im telling you its a fruit
and i happen to know its a vegetable
tell you what why dont we leet an impartial judge decide
fine with me
harry turns to joe mental
mentalino settle our bet are jelly beans fruits or vegetables
mental grits his teeth as he pops a few antacid pills in his mouth
he reaches into his coat pocket and we see a glint of steel
just when hes about to pull the gun out though lloyd hits the breaks and skids to a stop beside a bunch of hitchhiking migrant workers
the trio have picked up six migrant workers and everyone is crammed into the car including a crying baby who sits on a pissed off mentals lap
someones playing a flamenco guitar and the gang is singing a spanish song
the migrant family is gone now
harry and lloyd are playing a game while mental stares straight ahead furious
his eyes are watering and he looks ill
okay harry my turn
let er rip
harry lifts a cheer and lets out a loud fart
lloyd sniffs a few times then closes his eyes and wafts it up toward his nostrils as if it was the aroma of a fine wine
full bodied delicate bouquet aged to perfection will rip no fart before its time
beat come on marquis of dingleberrys rules you got ten seconds
ill say cheese doodles chili dog extra onions garden salad with blue
kit kat bar
harry throws up his arms defeated
he hands lloyd a buck
youre the best man
beat okay my turn
where are your manners harry
we have a guest
harry punches mentals shoulder playfully
come on mr
let one fly
its only a buck
a large neon road sign beside the cafe shows a mans exasperated face with flames shooting from his nose mouth and ears
the sign advertises hottest chili
lloyd and harry are sitting at a table with a hateful joe mental
the boys are each holding up a ill do one if you will
okay you go first
no you go first
no you go first
why dont you both stop being a couple of pussies and go at the same time
it aint that hot
lloyd and harry exchange a look then simultaneously bite hmmm not bad
yeah more tingly than hot
suddenly the boys eyes light up
they let out a shriek
a smile begins to curl on mentals lips
he pours them a couple glasses of water from a pitcher
have some water
lloyd and harry who are both sweating profusely now start to gulp down their water
this of course makes it burn more
aw shucks thats right
water just makes it worse
the boys run to the bar and dump pitchers of water on their heads much to the elight of a chuckling joe mental
mental is on the phone outside the front door talking to nicholas andre
im just sitting down to a nice meal with our boys
what did you find out so far
nothing yet but im gonna shake em own for information at lunch
beat then im gonna kill em for dessert
well eat fast times running out
and whatever you do dont let them get any closer
i dont need them here running around aspen
mental pulls a black vial of pills out of his jacket
relax they aint gonna be running around anywhere after i dump a little cyanide in their pops
back at the table the boys are soaked and huffing as if they just finished the boston marathon
the burgers have been served but lloyd and harry are still too traumatized to touch them
that really wasnt very polite of him was it
maybe we should loosen the screws of his chair
harry dunne im surprised at you
perhaps its about time you brushed fearing adults call the bible
its crammed with all kinds of pithy rules to live your life by
humbled you mean like turn the other cheek
no i mean like an eye for an eye
hand me those peppers the atomic ones
harry passes the jar and the two of them load joe mentals whispering here he comes
lloyd and harry bite into their food as joe mental sits back down at the table
feeling any better boys
as he pours ketchup on his burger the guys glance at each other and titter
then he picks it up and brings it to his mouth
just before biting into it though he pauses
so tell me why you fellas headed to aspen
more like re location
mental starts toward the burger but stops again
doesnt look like you packed much
all i saw was a couple bags
and that briefcase
the briefcase isnt even ours
some lady just left it at the airport
were bringing it back to her
this is news to mental
you mean you dont even know her
i was just her limo river
mental looks at the two of them and realizes that theyre serious
then he breaks out talk about being in the wrong place at the wrong time
lloyd and harry share a confused look
mental shakes his head and bites into his burger chewing heartily
almost immediately his happy demeanor is replaced by a look of horror
his face turns red he grabs his stomach and falls the boys look at each other guiltily then bend down to help him
hey you okay man
it was just a goof
in my coat
harry checks mentals coat pocket for his antacid pills but unwittingly brings out the black of cyanide pills
he shakes some pills out and hands them to mental who tosses them in his mouth and starts to munch on them
for a moment he appears to improve
his breathing slows and he sits up
then his eyes mentals pov quick zoom in on the black bottle harry is holding
you son of a bitch
mental gurgles and keels over dead
lloyd and harry are back on the road looking solemn
i cant believe it
life is a fragile thing har
one minute youre chewing on a burger the next minute youre dead meat
but he blamed me
you heard him
those were his last words
if you dont count that gurgling sound
harry lets out a groan
hey relax man im just as responsible as you are we both slipped him the peppers and look at me i ont feel guilty at all
small comfort coming from a man who sells dead birds to blind kids
dont you get it lloyd
ive got a ead guy pissed at me
his restless spirit will probably haunt me for the next seventy five years
you probably wont live to see forty
harry perks up cheered by this thought
what a relief
as the mutt cutts van flashes by on its westward journey we a doctor is covering up the body of joe mental as he talks to detective dale
the etective is a no nonsense type in his mid forties with a military regulation crewcut
my official conclusion is that the eceased expired from oxygen eprivation caused by the presence of cyanide in the bloodstream
you mean he was poisoned
we found these by the body
he holds up the container of cyanide pills
dale nods and approaches another cop in the b
waitress says he was with a couple of younger guys
theyre the ones who called the ambulance then they hit the road
any idea where they were going
a witness at the next table thought he heard them say they were driving to france
dale frowns at this and the cop shrugs
we got a report they were seen heading west on i toward colorado
get a make on the vehicle
the cop consults his note pad
they were driving an poodle
dale does a double take
straight faced well it might have been a wire haired terrier detective
theyre very similar in appearance
the detective looks confused as we the boys are extremely exhausted as they plow through the black night toward aspen
lets get off and crash at a motel before i crash into one
yawning i need a crib fast
were gonna have to hold out
seems we misjudged our expense allocation
if we pay for a motel we wont have enough for gas
what happened to the dough
we over leveraged
i sprung for mr
chili peppers last meal
felt it was the least we could o after we deep sixed him
wait a second one burger put us over budget
the slob ordered a double bacon eluxe and a chocolate malt
beat so what are we gonna do
weve only got ten more hours
we can take turns
a frightened j
shay is talking on the phone with nicholas andre
you heard me hes dead
the bastards killed him
andre nervously lights a cigarette as he speaks
andres forehead begins to glisten with perspiration
all right i want you back here now
if theyre coming this way im going to need you
hows our bankroll doing
giving you a hard time
melvins not the problem
its these two other guys that have me worried
i wish i knew what the hell they wanted
andre hangs up the phone and then disappears down his basement stairs
the room has a dirt floor
theres a stone well in the middle
we hear muffled human whimpering coming from deep within the well
andre walks to the edge of the dark hole
how you doing today melvin
andre takes a hit off his cigarette and flicks it into the well
the mutt cutts van cruises down the lonely interstate
lloyd is now fast asleep in the passenger seat as harry drives on
a roadsign reading denver miles whizzes by
todd rundgrens too far gone begins to play while harry peers at the empty highway introspectively
as the song plays we see a series of quick shots a new sign says denver miles
lloyd is still asleep with his feet now on harrys lap
another sign reads denver miles
harry stares straight ahead practically catatonic
lloyds feet are out the window and his head is on harrys lap
the next roadsign says denver miles
lloyds feet are now up over the headrest and his head is down where his feet should be
harry looks on the verge of blacking out
finally a sign reads colorado state line miles food the mutt cutts van pulls up to a gas pump
in the background are several tractor trailer rigs and a cafe
harry climbs out thoroughly exhausted walks around and opens the passenger door
lloyd tumbles to the asphalt still asleep
harry nudges him with his foot
come on wake up
you pay ill pump
lloyd comes to and grudgingly pulls himself up to his feet
harry moves to the back of the poodle van
he has to lift one of the cars rear legs to unscrew the gas cap
then he sticks the nozzle in and starts to fill her up
lloyd comes around the corner dragging a bathroom key attached by a chain to a car engine toward the mens room
when he gets it to the door he struggles to lift the engine on its side finally managing to slip the key into the lock
harry is yawning as he pumps the gas
suddenly a jeep cherokee pulls up and a long legged tanned athletic beauty climbs out
this seems to wake harry up
the athletic beauty smiles at harry as she grabs a pump and starts to fill her jeep
harry makes a feeble attempt to brush his hair into place then clears his throat and nods to the skis on her roof rack
she continues to pump gas
both of em
like a big dog is pissing on his leg
excuse me youre spraying everywhere
harry turns to see the gas gushing all over his shoes
he immediately removes the nozzle and replaces it on the pump as she smiles to herself
lloyd is standing in a stall urinating
he starts to read the graffiti scrawled on the wall
finally he comes to one that says for a good time meet me here november he frowns at this then looks nervously at his watch
close up of dial the date reads november
zoom in on the minute hand as it clicks to exactly
just as a concerned look crosses lloyds face we hear the bathroom door squeak open and slam shut
terrified lloyd quickly locks the stall door then crouches on the toilet bowl so his feet arent visible
the sound of heavy footsteps approaches the stall and then stops
lloyd looks down to see a pair of size workboots beneath the door
we can barely hear a low growl
then the stall handle jiggles
lloyd holds his breath
the ominous boots move away and lloyd lets out a all of a sudden the door is kicked in and a towering figure steps into frame
lloyd looks up and gasps
his pov its the redneck trucker sea bass
well well well if it aint my old friend
checks watch and right on time
as sea bass steps into the stall we the athletic beauty is back in her jeep now and harry has sidled up to the drivers side
he leans against her side view mirror
re suitcases in back seat thats a lot of luggage for a little vacation
actually im moving to aspen
ive got to get away from my boyfriend
hes such a klutz
my astrologer told me i should avoid accident prone guys
just then the side view mirror harry has been leaning on holding out mirror here this is a little loose
she throws the mirror into the back seat and takes out a cigarette
he pulls out a match and lights it with a debonair flourish
the athletic beauty nods her thanks
harry tosses the match to the ground and we hear an o
wisps of smokes rise around him and we hear the low crackle of something burning
neither of them notice this
look um maybe when i get to aspen we can meet up
you know for hot chocolate or something
she looks him over and smiles
you seem pretty harmless
ill give you my number
just let me find a pen
as she starts to rummage through her purse harry smells the smoke
he looks down and sees that his right shoe is ablaze
he shakes it then tries to put it out with the other shoe but to no avail
meanwhile the athletic beauty is still searching for a pen
i know i have one here somewhere
harry starts doing a soft shoe dance to extinguish the flames
this only helps to fan them
urgently look why dont you just tell it to me ive got a good memory
are you sure you wont forget
desperate positive please hurry
he begins hopping around violently
is something wrong
harry shakes his head no as he bites his lip to keep from screaming
okay my number is
beat oh wait a second thats my old number
its so funny how your mind god sakes give me the damn number
shes taken aback by this outburst
look man if youre gonna get pushy you can just forget it
she throws the car into drive and peels away
sea bass has his meaty paw wrapped around lloyds neck as he slides him up the wall of the toilet stall
first im gonna rape you then im gonna kill you
any last request
um yeah could you do it the other way around
sea bass pushes lloyd to his knees
then the trucker steps back and undoes his fly
the sound of the zipper brings a green color to lloyds face
on the mens room door it bursts open and a flame footed harry rushes into the bathroom panic stricken
in his desperation he plows through the stall door knocking sea bass on the head and thrusts his flaming foot into the toilet harry breathes a deep sigh of relief
only then does he notice harry has to do a double take for this to sink in
then he lets out an admonishing youve got some serious explaining to o young man
close up of harrys burnt shoe with the toes sticking out on the accelerator
look harry i told you what happened now drop it
sure thing lloyd
i promise not to mention another word about you being in a bathroom stall with a six foot five inch trucker with his pants own
thats a low blow man
not at that height its not
listen bud if youre trying to imply that im that thought look were almost in colorado
i think its about time we pull over and change seats
ive been driving for nine straight hours i dont have the energy to start a new state
lloyd nods and as he pulls off the exit we close on a sign it reads welcome to colorado home of the rocky mountains
pan down to reveal a number of policemen stopping and checking cars as they cross the border
a helicopter lands on the side of the road and detective dale hops out
he hurries to the cop in charge
any sign of them yet
no but were expecting them shortly
a motorist said he spotted a pooch about thirty miles back headed this way
detective dale nods satisfied
establishing shot of a mini mart
the door opens and lloyd gets in carrying a bag of doritos and a soda
he settles into the drivers seat and pulls a beef jerky out of his back pocket
hey i picked you up a beef jerky
when he gets no response he notices that harry is already fast asleep in the passenger seat
lloyd shakes his head
boy some guys just werent cut out for life on the road
lloyd starts the engine and pulls out of the parking lot to the nearby freeway entrance
as he enters the on ramp we zoom in on a sign that says route east
hes unwittingly headed back in the direction they just came from
its bright daylight now
harry is sleeping peacefully in the passenger seat while lloyd sips a coffee
the van hits a bump which causes harrys eyes to flutter open
sleepy head welcome back
groggy how long have i been out
id say a good five hours anyway
harry yawns and stretches
we must be getting real close huh
ive been averaging about ninety miles an hour all night
boy ill tell you this is one angerous highway
you wouldnt believe all the road pizza two dead ogs a couple of rabbits a snake and some big thing i couldnt even recognize
did you see them get hit or were they already lying there
i hit em
harry rubs his eyes and looks at the passing flatlands
i expected the rocky mountains to be a little rockier than this
i was thinking the same thing
that john denvers some full of shit huh
they both stare out the window
i must say des moines sure is a pretty little town
yeah it really is
beat wait a minute when did you visit des moines
we drove through it
what are you talking about
you were snoring like a baby when we went through des moines
lloyd shakes his head in amusement then snaps his fingers in harrys face
sing song hello
rise and shine
you were the one who was asleep numbskull
here take a sip of coffee
a confused harry sips the coffee and checks out the passing terrain
then something starts to awn on him
uh lloyd refresh my memory doesnt the sun rise in the east and set in the west
in our country it does yes
then perchance you can explain to me why the sun is in our face at in the morning when were heading west
lloyd thinks about this and then looks sickened
the mutt cutts van is parked next to a couple rigs and harry is sitting beside it on the pavement a broken man
im only human harry
anybody can make a mistake
but harry just sits there practically catatonic
come on man pull yourself together
you know i got half a mind to just jump on the bus to europe and say goodbye to your ugly mug forever
rolls his eyes you cant take a bus to europe dodo
you dont have a passport
harry lets out a defeated sigh
come on stop being a baby about this
okay so we back tracked a tad
lloyd you drove almost a sixth of the way across the country in the wrong direction
now we dont have enough money to get to aspen we ont have enough money to get home we dont have enough to eat we dont have enough to sleep
well it doesnt do any good having you sitting there on your butt whining about it
if were gonna get out of this hole were gonna have to dig ourselves out
harry thinks about this
you know youre absolutely right lloyd
he stands up brushes off his pants and starts to walk toward the highway
where you going
im walking home
you cant be serious
sarcastic why not
were probably only five miles away
harry starts resolutely toward the road while lloyd watches
thanks a lot mr
like you never screwed up
harry suddenly stops in his tracks and turns back to his friend
he seems completely rained
beat i never should have let you talk me into this in the first place
youve got a good reason to goo a beautiful girls waiting for you
but lets face it lloyd theres nothing waiting for me in aspen
beat theres nothing waiting for me anywhere
lloyd just stands there speechless as harry turns and walks away
out of frustration he bangs the snout of the car causing it to bark
harry is walking down the highway his thumb stuck out unenthusiastically
a few cars whiz by the cold wind whipping at his clothes
a station wagon blows by and throws a bag of garbage out the window
it lands at harrys feet
extreme close up of harrys face a tear slowly rolls down his cheek like the indian in the commercial
pan down to the bag of garbage
we see its a bag of onions thats ripped open
suddenly a hearse pulls up and stops
its an ominous looking vehicle and harry hesitates
then the passenger window rolls down revealing a contrite lloyd at the wheel
got room for one more if you still want to go to aspen
harry looks the hearse over
whered you find this baby
used car dealer
i traded the van for it
plus i got the guy to throw in fifty bucks for gas money
beat come on man what do you say
we still partners
an impatient detective dale is still staked out at the colorado border with several other officers
it doesnt make sense
they shouldve been here hours ago
maybe theyre smarter than we thought
how smart can they be
theyre riving a goddamn dog
another cop rushes over holding his walkie talkie
we just got a report that they were spotted about two hours ago heading east near des moines on i
incredulous des moines
why thats five hundred miles from here
guess they got wind of our welcoming party
were wasting time
dale heads for his cruiser while the other cops follow
as the officers climb into their cars we lloyd is driving and harry has his feet out the window
tell me something harry
would you really have kept going home if i hadnt come back to get you
well let me put it this way lloyd do you remember when we were cub scouts and we got lost in the woods uring that blizzard
we huddled together all night and we made an oath that if we ever got out of there alive wed never ever leave each others side again
do you remember that
lloyd thinks hard about this
we were never cub scouts
just then several cop cars whiz by them in the opposite direction with sirens blaring and lights flashing
when harry glances back at the cop cars he notices that theres a coffin in the rear of the vehicle
what the hell is this
theres a coffin in the back
relax its empty
i dont give a shit
im not driving anywhere with a casket
you know im superstitious calm down
well dump it off first chance we get
harry and lloyd are swerving through traffic in the hearse
ahead of them is a real funeral procession
the lead car is a cadillac
this is the car right behind the funeral hearse
a man and a woman are arguing
i married a cheapskate
shut your trap gerdie
im so embarrassed
ill never be able to show my face again
i knew something good would come out of this
we could have given him a more ignified burial
your uncle was a cheap man
remember what he got us for our twenty fifth
a friggin fern
theres no way im gonna spend a load to get him planted
while the couple argues on harry and lloyd cut in front of them
the man and the woman ont notice this an soon the harry and lloyd pull up to a large green dumpster behind the market
the procession comes to a halt behind them
the guys get out of the hearse and remove the coffin from the back
then they unceremoniously heave the coffin into the dumpster on the lead car of the procession the womans jaw is practically on the floor
you son of a bitch
i want a ivorce
the hearse drives past a sign that says entering aspen the boys stroll down the sidewalk looking in the windows studying the passersby taking in the sights and sounds of
the ski town
isnt this wonderful
what more could a couple of single guys like us ask for
how about food and shelter
youre so materialistic
beat why dont we get down to business and eliver the briefcase to mary
who knows maybe shell invite us in for tea and a strumpet or two
jolly good idea chap
and where oes the lovely young lady reside
harry throws lloyd a concerned look but then notices a phone booth next to them
well whats her last name
well look it up in the phone book
you know i dont believe i caught that either
harrys concern grows
what about the briefcase lloyd
there mustve been a name on it right
brightening come to think of it there is
its engraved right into the leather
what is it
samsonite spelled just like it sounds
harry starts flipping through the phone book
then abruptly he stops and puts the book down a defeated look on his face
the car is parked in a parking lot across the street from a picturesque bridge
harry and lloyd are shivering in the front seat as a loud icy wind whips though the hearse
theyre each spooning something out of a coffee cup and sipping it
any soup left
shall we share it
lloyd opens a tiny ketchup packet and squirts half of it into harrys cup and the other half into his
they pour a few drops of water in and mix it with their spoons
mmmm mmmm good
lloyd smiles bravely at harry
harry notices something and leans toward him
hey you got something stuck in your front teeth
lloyd picks a small speck out of his mouth and studies it
looks like an old piece of beef jerky
wanna split it
get your own
loyd puts the floss meat back in his mouth and chews it
another gust of wind swirls around them
im freezing my ass off lloyd
roll up your window
it is rolled up
then i guess the damn anti cold system isnt working
you really should get it fixed if were gonna live here all winter
what anti cold system
lloyd points to the dash
right here the a c button
i put it on full blast about an hour ago and if anything the cars getting colder
harry stares at lloyd and then throws down his cup disgusted
he opens the car door and starts to climb out
what are you going out there for
to warm up
harry gets out and leans against the car with his arms crossed
lloyd comes from around the other side
what are you worrying about now
im worried about how youre gonna survive the pummeling im about to give you
suddenly harry lunges at lloyd who takes off around the other side of the car
harry leaps across the hood but lloyd manages to evade his grasp
harry calm down
youre acting like a wild animal
get over here and take your medicine lloyd
sorry doc i cant take medicine
im a christian scientist
lloyd continues to outrun him around the car
frustrated harry opens the car and pulls the what are you doing
something i shouldve done a long time ago
this stupid thing has been the root of our problems all along
harry starts walking toward the bridge spanning a river
dont do anything foolish harry
this is the most sensible thing ive done in years
im gonna toss this goddamn curse right into that river
lloyd starts to follow after harry
youre making a big mistake harry
ill never forgive you for this
harry keeps marching toward the bridge determined to dispose of the briefcase
harry hold up
things are gonna get better i promise
in fact i think i feel another piece of beef jerky in my left molar
its yours harry all yours
harry stops in his tracks intrigued
no im not man look
lloyd pulls his cheek back revealing a molar
harry squints at it
thats a filling you liar
just then lloyd makes a dash at harry
harry turns and runs but lloyd tackles him as they reach the bridge
the briefcase goes flying and the guys wrestle pitifully with one another in the snow rolling over and over
finally harry manages to get the upper hand
he climbs on top and clasps his hands i used to have a life
a miserable one but a life nonetheless
suddenly lloyds eyes light up as he sees something o
behind his friend
harry turns and his eyes light up too
he lets go of lloyd as we see harry and lloyd are hurrying down the sidewalk clutching the briefcase
the city is lit up with millions of tiny lights like a fantasy winter wonderland
okay heres the plan we borrow a few bucks just a small loan from the briefcase and we check into a cheap motel
and well keep track of the money we spend with ious
well be meticulous right down to the last penny
that way whatever we borrow we can pay back
were good for it
you know as soon as we get jobs
itll come right out of our first paycheck
a tuxedoed bell captain barnard is showing the guys around an enormous and luxurious suite
the place is big enough to throw a touchdown bomb in
this is the hotel danburys presidential suite gentlemen
its normally reserved for royalty visiting dignitaries and illustrious stars of stage and take it
the bell captain is a bit taken aback but pleased
very good sir
are there any bags youd like sent up
thanks barnard but well find our own chicks
peevish i wasnt talking about ladies
then go ahead and send thim up
what are their names
sir i meant your luggage
harry forces a
embarrassed half smile
tell you what you can send up my friend how about some chow
the bell captain nods
ill bring you a menu
just order us one of everything
at this harry serves lloyd a reproachful look
one of everything
lloyd looks guilty
beat make that two of everything
harry smiles at this as lloyd pulls a wad of hundred dollar bills out of his pocket
he rips one off and tucks it in barnards top pocket
and here you go barney
you keep us happy well keep you happy
the bell captain barnard is energized by this tip
he bows and leaves the room
then lloyd cracks open the briefcase and inserts a small piece
proudly our first iou
signed and dated
helen swanson is knocking on her step daughters bedroom door
shes holding a tray with a couple of mugs on it
mary is sitting in a chair looking sadly out the french windows when helen enters
i brought you some tea
i thought it might help you relax
she takes a mug sips and pulls back
whats in this whiskey
that ones mine
helen grabs the mug from mary and hands her the other one
feeling any better honey
mary cant take her eyes from the window
just knowing that melvins out there being held by god knows who
fighting back tears its all my fault
i shouldve been there
you cant blame yourself for this
if youd been there they wouldve taken you too
helen pulls out a joint and torches it up
she takes a hit
maybe we should just pay them the money again and get this thing over with
now mary everything that can be done is being done
youve got to stop torturing yourself
what am i supposed to do
go about my life as if everything were fine
thats exactly what you should do
get the hell out more go skiing socialize
dont you see honey
we cant let on that anything is wrong
if the press or authorities get wind of this the kidnappers might panic
beat who knows what theyd do to poor melvin then
the guys pull up to the front of the hotel in the hearse
several hotel employees rush to help them
harry and lloyd get out wearing overly trendy ski garb complete with fur boots nasa designed goggles and splashy fluorescent colors everywhere
the employees all grab the shopping bags and then line up as lloyd tips them all handsomely
the huge beds are covered in boxes and bags of new goodies
lloyd is going through it all
harry is sitting out on the balcony with his feet up on the railing checking out the mountain view
oh god its really true
last night i thought i mightve been dreaming
its no dream har
we finally cracked the big time
and it was so simple
all it took was somebody elses money
harry lights a cigar with a twenty dollar bill takes a hearty puff and you know lloyd i think you mightve gone a little overboard with the spending today
he blows out the twenty and tosses it off the balcony
whats the big deal
were gonna pay it all back anyway right
sure but do you really think you needed to buy those two surfboards
i thought those were beginners skis
this suddenly makes sense to harry
i was wondering why you had those bindings put on them
lloyd opens a box and holds up a scanty negligee
whered this come from
sheepishly i bought it
i like the feel of it against my skin
defensive i mean you know when a womans wearing it
lloyd inspects it more closely
harry how many women do you know who wear a size xxl
look leave me alone
im rich now
im supposed to have a few eccentricities
theres a knock on the door
enter parlez vous
the bell captain barnard enters with a champagne bucket and a newspaper under his arm
i brought you your newspaper and some champagne gentlemen
unfortunately we didnt seem to have the um label you requested
lloyd examines the champagnes label and frowns
all out of boones farm huh
you have a rapier wit sir
i took the liberty of bringing a comparable substitute dom perignon
guess itll have to do slugger eh
lloyd smiles and over tips him
thank you so much sir
he puts the tray down hands lloyd the newspaper and heads for the door
oh one more thing you can dispense with the sir crap
lets face it barney were all from the same mold
winks we just have a little more dough than you right now
barnard smiles and exits
harry comes back in the room
he picks up a champagne glass and flicks it with his finger sending out a resonant ring
cocktail hour has commenced
he starts to open the champagne bottle as lloyd begins thumbing through the newspaper
hey later on what do you say we
he notices that lloyds mouth has dropped open at something hes found in the paper
dumbstruck harry its her
mary with the briefcase
this is her
he shoves the newspaper at harry
close on the headline it reads swansons to host preservation gala tonight citys elite expected
underneath this is a photograph of mary with her parents
come on cinderella its time to get you ready for the ball
roy orbisons pretty woman plays over a
the boys are in a beauty parlor getting their hair shampooed
harry and lloyd sit beneath old fashioned hair dryers
the attendants lift the dryers from their heads revealing both guys hair in curlers
lloyds getting shaved by an attendant with a straight razor
suddenly lloyd grabs his neck as if hes been nicked
blood squirts out from between his fingers
the other customers stare in horror at this
lloyd laughs and shows everyone a squeeze ketchup bottle hidden in his hand
only harry and lloyd seem to find this joke amusing
we see them getting their nose hairs clipped
pan down to the floor to reveal a pile of then a shot of a man next to them getting a pedicure
pan over to lloyds bare feet he has toe nails like howard hughes
sparks are flying as an attendant wearing safety goggles tries to sand down lloyds toenails with an electric sander
harry is lying on his stomach with his shirt off getting a massage from a beautiful oriental masseuse
he pulls a hundred dollar bill from under his towel hands it to her and whispers in her ear
next we see the oriental masseuse lying on her stomach with her shirt off while harry happily massages her back
the guys are in an expensive haberdashery
harry comes out of the dressing room in a very elegant black tuxedo
he couldnt look any more suave
the saleman nods impressed but lloyd shakes his head no and harry goes back in
harry reappears in another stylish white tuxedo
the salesman looks on hopefully but lloyd again disapproves
this time harry comes out in a junior prom like sky blue tuxedo complete with tacky frills
the salesman looks sickened as lloyd give harry the thumbs up
pan across the street from the haberdashery an apprehensive j
shay is sitting in a parked car watching harry and
throngs of guests in black tie and elegant gowns are entering the building
suddenly the hearse pulls up with harry and lloyd bumper surfing behind it
harrys wearing his blue tuxedo
lloyds tux isnt any better its pumpkin orange
theyve got matching top hats and canes
when the hearse stops the boys hand the driver barnard a couple hundred dollars
thanks for the lift barney
nicholas andre is greeting people at the door
however when harry and lloyd try to enter he stops them and gives them the once over
excuse me gentlemen but this is a five hundred dollar a plate dinner
harry and lloyd look at each other and shrug
then lloyd takes out a wad of bills and peels off ten hundreds much to the amazement of andre
this should cover a couple plates
im kind of hungry lloyd
what if we want seconds
lloyd thinks about this
then he peels off another thou
put us down for four plates my good man
they enter the party
as andre watches them go his associate j
shay comes up beside him an alarmed look on his face
jesus christ boss
back on harry and lloyd the guys make their way through the affluent crowd
im getting nervous harry
these people are just like you and me
what are you talking about
theyre educated well bred charming and sophisticated
we can be sophistica holy shit would you look at the fun bags on that hose hound
he points out a busty blonde bombshell entering the party
lloyd rolls his eyes
dont do this to me harry
im already a wreck
what if mary oesnt like me
look lets just go saddle up to the bar and down a couple bowls of loudmouth soup
a little boozell bring back that old lloyd christmas over confidence
the guys stand out at the glittering social scene as they make their way to the bar
to bartender two martinis straight up
as harry and lloyd silently take in the party a beautiful red head reaches between them for a cocktail napkin then walks away
shut up harry
i didnt say anything
yeah well i know what you were gonna say and im telling you to shut up in advance
how do you know what i was gonna say
i read you like a book
okay if you read me like a book then what was i gonna say
you were gonna say in harrys looped thats one fiery bush i wouldnt mind roasting my weenie in
harry raises his eyebrows impressed
and i would say shut up because this is our chance to get in with the rich and powerful and you dont ingratiate yourself to the kind of people by
acting like ron jeremy on spanish fly
the bartender delivers their martinis as we hear the o
clinking of a glass
the guys turns to see nicholas andre standing at a podium
next to him is a large covered display
on his other side are karl and elizabeth swanson
if i could have your attention please
the crowd quiets
id like to thank you all for coming to this very special event
as you founded and chiefly funded by our great benefactors karl and helen swanson is the worlds foremost efender of endangered species
our three separate varieties of animals that are currently listed on the united nations charter of protected species
tonight we are deeply honored to have mr
karl swanson welcome our twenty fourth
the crowd claps as mr
swanson takes andres place at the podium
ladies and gentlemen i give you the icelandic snow owl
he pulls the cover off revealing two majestic fluffy white owls in a cage
everyone oohs and ahhs
these magnificent specimens were year two million dollar effort on our part
together they constitute one seventh of the snow owl population left on the planet
on andre hes nervously eyeing harry and lloyd
he looks pale
here these lovely birds will be allowed to breed in a natural but protected habitat
and god willing with your help and that of the societys we will see these wonderful creatures flourish once more
again thank you and enjoy your evening
oh and feel free to take a closer look at our new friends here
the crowd applauds and begins to mingle again
lloyd turns back to the bartender and holds up his empty glass
two more please
harry stares at lloyd with concern
lloyd ive never seen you this uptight
youve gotta chill out
i cant help it
this is a very important night for me
beat harry have you ever wondered why you and i never have long term girlfriends
what are you talking about
i went out with fraida felcher for two and a half weeks
that was a fluke
beat the reason we never have long term girlfriends is because of one thing were afraid of the c word
we live for the c word
im talking bout commitment
well im ready for commitment harry
the first time i laid eyes on mary swanson i knew she was the one
beat some things you feel in your heart other things you feel in your groin
this girl makes me feel it all in the heart
suddenly lloyd notices something across the room
spectacular black cocktail dress
lloyd quickly turns toward the bar
oh shit there she is
checking her out wow
you werent kidding lloyd
shes an angel
beat well what are you waiting for
get over there and talk to her
shes gonna think im some kind of psycho when she realizes how far i came just to see her
you have her briefcase shes gonna be thrilled to see you
and then what
shell take it back and thatll be it
im a nobody
harry thinks about this a moment
look man you just drove two thousand miles to see this girl
dont quit on the last fifty feet
brightening wait a second i have an idea
you go over and introduce yourself
that way you can build me up so when i come along i wont have to brag about myself
tell her im good looking and im rich and i have a rapists wit
i cant tell her youre good looking lloyd shes got eyes
lloyd takes a big gulp of his new martini
please harry im appealing to you as one loser to another
just build me up and then give me a signal to come over
but youre gonna owe me a big one for this
harry straightens his polka dot bow tie then approaches mary who is now standing alone admiring the owls
nice set of hooters you got there
mary turns to harry stunned
i beg your pardon
beat are you a bird lover
well i used to have a parakeet but my main area of expertise is canines thats dogs to the layperson
she smiles at this
i love dogs too
so how are you involved with them
oh ive trained them bathed them clipped them ive even bred them
any unusual breeding
nah mostly just doggie style
but one time we successfully mated a bulldog and a shitzu
we called it a bullshit
breaks out laughing just a little breeder joke
she seems strangely charmed by this
anyway the real reason i came over is because i want to introduce you to a friend of mine
just then marys stepmother approaches
shes holding a martini and looking a little sloshed
mary i dont believe ive met your friend
actually we havent been introduced yet
holds out hand im mary swanson and this is my stepmother helen
pleasure meeting you both
i saw you come in earlier mr
i was hoping wed get a chance to meet
taken aback you were
that tuxedo i love a man with a sense of humor
so does mary
mary shoots helen a look then smiles at harry
for a moment hes caught up in marys eyes but then manages to snap out of it
anyway about my friend you doing anything tomorrow mr
because i believe marys looking for somebody to hit the slopes with
helen youre embarrassing me
well you are arent you
to harry poor girl doesnt get out enough
so what do you say harry
are you available
harry thinks about this then looks across the room at a hopeful lloyd
oh i dont know
you see my friend your friends for one day
you and mary will have a ball
marys captivating eyes meet his waiting for an answer
i dont know
you see the thing is
on lloyd he waits impatiently at the bar as harry returns
how come you didnt call me over
relax youre golden
i got you a ate with her tomorrow
lloyd falls back against the bar and grabs his chest
smiles i love you man
i love you
lloyd clamps an embarrassed harry in a tight embrace
okay get a grip lloyd
youre making a scene
lloyd steps back elated
this calls for a toast
he grabs a bottle of champagne out of a bucket and starts to open it
youre gonna be my best man har i mean it
it was always between you and my future wifes brother but you just earned a seat at the head table pal
suddenly the cork shoots out of the champagne bottle and eyed owls
in quick succession we hear a bok
and a thump
a hush falls over the entire party as everyone turns their stunned attention to the cage
owls lies on its back its species now one bird closer to extinction
harry and lloyd look on in horror
harry takes the smoking champagne bottle from lloyd and places it on the bar
under breath i think weve done enough hobnobbing lloyd
the guys lower their heads and slink out of the room before anyone can figure out what happened anyone except for nicholas andre that is we pan to show that
hes been standing nearby watching their every move
and he doesnt look very happy
nicholas andre is pacing the room with a drink in his hand while j
shay looks on nervously
maybe it was just a coincidence
dont be stupid
its a message plain and simple we killed their bird now they killed ours
but how could anybody off a bird with a cork
these guys arent just anybody
look what they did to mental
he was the best and yet he fell right into their web
but the bastards already got our money
what the hell more could they want
andre runs his fingers through his hair
at wits end i dont know god damn it
a jubilant lloyd is fixing his hair in the mirror
in the b
harry is putting on his new ski clothes including a pair of thermal tights
you know it has kind of a ring to it oesnt it har
sounds nice lloyd but dont you think you may be jumping the gun a little
i mean who knows when you get to know her you may find out shes not your type
i know my type when i see it
now let me get this straight she wants me to meet her at the avalanche bar and grill on main street
thats what she said
ten oclock sharp
this is when lloyd notices harrys get up
where are going ressed like that
i uh thought while you were making your love connection id try my luck on the slopes
you mean youre gonna go out in public dressed in tights
these arent tights
theyre fashionable euro trash ski trousers
but you can see the outline of your who who
harry looks down at his crotch
harry turns his profile against the window
actually its just a tiny little lump
no one will ever notice
i cant go out dressed like this
establishing shot of the building
people are putting their boots on and their skis are lined up on the wall behind them
mary is waiting by the fireplace in an incredibly sexy snowsuit
suddenly harry appears in the room dressed ridiculously
as he begins to clumsily make his way through the lodge toward mary we see that he already has his skis on
he kicks over a row of skis and gets glares from all sides
finally he reaches her out of breath
sorry im late
its a bitch driving a clutch with these things
harry and mary are at the front of the lift line
the couple ahead of them get on a chair and then they shuffle into position
harry crouches nervously waiting for the chair
the chair swings around comes up behind them and makes a smooth pick up of mary that is
an embarrassed harry is still in the crouching position having missed the ride
mary looks back at him confused
suddenly he pretends to be stretching
you take the first run alone
im gonna loosen up down here
lloyd enters the bar as the waiters are setting up for the day
im sorry we dont open until eleven
this is disconcerting news to lloyd
im meeting someone
mind if i wait at the bar
the waiter shrugs and lloyd sits down at the empty bar
harry and mary are now sitting together on a chair as it rises higher and higher toward the imposing mountain top
harry holds onto the chairs frame nervously
beautiful day huh harry
mary takes a deep breath
god it feels so good to get up here
i havent been outdoors much in the last couple of weeks
evasive theres been
i ont want to bore you with them
he looks mindlessly off in the distance
then harry notices a patch of frost on the chair lift bar
he licks it and his tongue immediately fuses with the frozen metal
he tugs a few times but it wont budge
are you okay
i do this all the time
as mary and harry arrive at the top of the lift mary disembarks but harry stays on
lisping see ya at the bottom
harry and the chair lift swing around and start heading down the hill
the chair lift comes back around with harry still sitting on it stuck to the bar
two little kids climb on with him
off their looks say kids you wouldnt happen to have a cup of warm water would you
the two kids just stare at him
a despondent lloyds got a couple of empties in front of him now
the bar is open and there are a few customers sprinkled about
lloyd takes a sip of his drink and looks up at the clock on the wall
we see a pair of beautiful legs slide onto the stool next to him
pan over to reveal that its the athletic beauty that harry had tried to pick up at the truck stop
lloyd grunts a hello
bad day huh
lloyd grunts once more
big smile well dont worry mercurys supposed to be coming out or retrograde tonight
things will get better
mary gracefully carves her way to the bottom of the hill and stops with a snow spraying flourish
she looks around the outdoor patio for harry
she spots something and does a double
has been removed from the cable
hes drinking a cup of coffee and trying to act nonchalant espite the gawking of the other skiers
theres a mime performing in the b
harry are you okay
lisping im fine im fine
itll come off
close up of harrys head through a rifle scope
reverse angle to reveal j
shay a few hundred feet up the hill with a high powered rifle trained on harry
youre luck just ran out pal
as his trigger finger twitches with anticipation we go this is silly
let me help you
mary gets up and stands behind harry
he moans nervously
she grabs his head in both hands and starts pulling it away from the bar
we see harrys tongue stretch ridiculously
harry groans in pain
suddenly his tongue comes undone and harry and mary fall backwards out of the path of j
shays bullet as it whizzes by
we hear the mime in the b
cry out in pain the poor mime holds his bleeding hand and retreats nervously into the lodge as the crowd boos him
lloyds now swimming in despair as the athletic beauty rambles on beside him
anyway after my boyfriend backed into my garage for the third time i said to myself run cathy run for your life before he kills you both
then you know what the klutz does and to be perfectly honest i ont really care
beat look im sorry but im not very good company today
beat i have an idea
why dont you tell me a little about yourself
maybe some other time
lloyd motions for the bartender
excuse me you wouldnt happen to know a mary swanson would you
her family comes in here all the time
do you know where she lives
yeah they got that big place up on alpine drive
the hearse pulls up to the house and stops
ive got to tell you today was really just what i needed
thanks a lot harry
my pleasure mary
she beams and gives him a kiss on the cheek
so youll pick me up tonight at
better make it quarter to eight
ive got a few things to take care of first
harry watches lovestruck as mary gets out of the car and walks toward the house
to himself mary dunne
got a nice ring to it
we pan from the hearse to some nearby bushes where we see a some best man
montage of lloyd walking through the hills of aspen totally lloyd is sitting forlornly on the bed while harry feigns surprise at what hes just heard
it doesnt make any sense lloyd
she told me ten oclock sharp
are you sure you went to the right bar
believe me it was the right place
i dont know har maybe she just had second thoughts
i have a hard time believing that lloyd
the girl said she couldnt wait to see you again
harry paces back and forth when suddenly something occures
wait a minute
it just occurred to me
she mustve meant ten oclock at night
brightening do ya think
why would she have you meet her at a bar at ten in the morning
shrugging i just figured she was a raging alcoholic
harry barks out a laugh at their stupidity
boy arent we a couple of beauties
i knew there was an explanation
and here i thought she was standing me up
thatll teach you to jump to conclusions
beat anyway since you have your night all planned i think ill run out and catch a flick
as harry walks into the closet to change lloyd clenches his fist and glares after him
then he regains his composure and moves to the bar
will you join me in a good luck toast before you head out
sure thing pal
whatever you think will help your chances
lloyd bites his lip at this
he fills two mugs with coffee and throws a splash of baileys in each
he check to make sure harry is still in the closet then pulls out a box of take
pretty snazzed out for a movie arent you
its for mature audiences
i ont wanna chance getting turned away at the door
lloyd hands him the mug with the ex lax
then he lifts his own glass
to my friend harry the matchmaker
harry feels a pang of guilt but drinks up anyway
he gulps down the drink
harrys driving along whistling happily to himself in anticipation of the night
suddenly we hear a low intestinal rumble
he reacts and rubs his stomach
the hearse parks on the street and harry gets out
hes walking up the steps to the house when we hear more gaseous thunder from his stomach
harry stops in his tracks gets his insides under control and continues to the front porch where he rings the bell
mary answers the door fiddling with her earrings
come on in
harry follows her inside
make yourself at home
im almost ready
just give me one more minute
as she disappears down a hallway we hear harrys upset stomach again
he notices a bathroom off the hallway and rushes inside
hold on harrys face as he quickly pulls his pants down and nestles onto the throne
he lets out a sigh of relief as he does his business then leans over and slides open the window to air the room out
hes still glued to the toilet when he hears a knock on the door
are you in there harry
nervously be right out
i hope youre not using the toilet
zoom in tight on harrys face his eyes go wide and a visible sweat breaks out on his forehead
it doesnt flush
um no i was just
a confused mary is standing outside the bathroom door
i was running a little late
thought this would save time
well ill be in the living room whenever youre ready
harrys got his pants back on and is lifting the lid off the toilet tank
he starts tinkering with a few valves
under breath come on flush you bastard
marys sitting patiently on the couch with her legs crossed
she looks at her watch then flips on the tv
on the tube the news is on
a woman reporter is addressing the camera gravely well be back in a minute with the story of the blind indiana boy who was duped into buying a dead parakeet
we see billy the blind boy from apartment c sitting in his wheelchair holding up petey the parakeet with its head scotch taped on its body
i thought he was real quiet
the reporter shakes her head and they go to a commercial
mary shivers at this and turns off the television
suddenly the doorbell rings
she gets up and opens the front door
her pov a dapper lloyd is standing there in his new aspen chic clothes
beat dont you remember me
im not really
i drove you to the airport last week
dawning on her oh my god
lloyd is thrilled at this
what are you doing in aspen
i brought you your briefcase you left it at the airport so i picked it up for you
marys mouth drops open
youre the one who took my briefcase
yeah its back at my hotel room
come on lets take a ride
ill give it to you
mary is torn between getting her briefcase and waiting for harry
wait right here
she goes to the bathroom door
inside we hear the loud clanking of metal against metal
harry what are you doing in there
harrys got the eintire toilet completely disassembled now
various pieces of the commode litter the floor including the big plastic float ball
hes on his knees tinkering with some pipes coming out of the wall
just cleaning my teeth
give me a minute mary ill be right with you
sorry but something importants come up and i have to run out
its sort of an emergency
ill explain later
but mary o
im really sorry harry
i promise well do this another time
harry hears her footsteps echo down the hallway and then the front door closing
harry slumps against the sink defeated
lloyd is in the passenger seat wearing a subtle satisfied smile
an anxious looking mary is at the wheel
the jaguar pulls up in front of the hotel
as lloyd and mary get out we pan over to reveal that they were being followed by nicholas andre and j
shay in a mercedes
andre pulls a pistol from beneath his seat and slips it into his coat
the door opens and lloyd and mary enter
so anyway as soon as i got to town i tried to look you up but i idnt know your last name
he leads her to the closed briefcase which is sitting on the bed
i dont believe it
you really have it
course i have it
when lloyd christmas drives a woman to the airport he makes sure she gets all her luggage no matter what he has to o
mary looks at lloyd and smiles
this is incredible
you mean to say you drove two thousand miles just for me
i mean you know there were other reasons
beat actually yeah i guess i did
she cant believe her ears
that is the sweetest thing ive ever heard
he drops his head and mary leans over and kisses him on the cheek
a sullen harry is driving back to the hotel
mumbling to himself its all kharma harry
you screw your best friend over and its gonna come back to haunt you plain and simple
close on lloyds face hes starry eyed in love as he spills his guts
look mary i know this may seem a little sudden but ive given it a lot of thought youre the woman ive been waiting for my whole life and im
not ashamed to admit it holds up his hand please let me finish
im crazy about you
ive never felt this way about anyone
you make it so easy for me to tell you my innermost desires
listen to me i feel like a schoolboy again
beat a schoolboy who desperately wants to make sweet sweet love to you
suddenly we hear toilet flushing o
reverse angle reveals that lloyd has been talking to an empty chair
the bathroom oor opens and mary comes out
she looks around expecting to see someone else
i thought i heard you talking to someone
lloyd is flustered
he swallows hard
its the moment of truth
i desperately want to make love to a schoolboy
taken aback maybe i should be going now
no thats not what imeant
i really like you mary
i like you a lot
she smiles at this
im gonna ask you something flat out and i want you to answer me honestly what do you think the chances are of a girl like you and a guy
like me ending up together
mary is obviously thrown by this question
lloyd thats difficult to say
i mean we hardly i asked you to be honest mary
but lloyd i really cant come on give it to me straight
i rove a long way to see you the least you can do is level with me
what are my chances
you mean not good like one out of a hundred
id say more like one out of a million
duh so youre telling me theres a chance
just then theres a knock at the door
when lloyd opens it hes face to face with nicholas andre
what are you doing here
ive been looking for you mary
ive got some interesting news about your husband
lloyd looks at mary devastated
arent you two going to invite me in
lloyd and mary hear a click and turn to see andre pointing a gun at them
andre steps into the room and we as harry mopes through the lobby we hear someone call out o
harry turns to see the athletic beauty approaching
what are you doing here
nicholas andre has his gun pointed at a stunned lloyd and mary
well at least you two got to say your goodbyes
who are you
dont play dumb with me asshole
im the rightful ower of that briefcase youve been carrying
mary cant believe whats happening
my family trusted you
uh sir about the briefcase i want you to know my friend harry and i have every intention of reimbursing you
andre looks alarmed
he motions mary to the briefcase with his gun
open that damn thing
mary opens the briefcase and a pile of white crumpled up balls of paper fall out along with a few packets of hundreds
what the hells this
wheres all the money
thats as good as money sir
those are our ious
you can add them up yourself
every pennys accounted for
andre looks like his head is about to burst in anger
youre fucking dead
now dont do anything hasty man
harry gets out of the elevator and lets himself into the presidential suite
harry enters looking contrite and calls out lloyd are you home
weve gotta talk man
i have a serious confession to make
harry comes around the corner and stops cold
his pov lloyd and mary are lying on the bed their arms handcuffed to the bedpost
oh good you found her
ill just leave you two kids alone
harry turns to go but bumps into the muzzle of andres gun
why dont you stay and join the party
harry is sitting beside lloyd and mary on the bed
nicholas andre keeps his gun trained on them while he speaks on the phone i want a one way ticket to rio de janerio departing as soon as possible
on the bed harry and lloyd cant look each other in the eye
you mean you two know each other
cutting yeah we used to be best friends
until he turned into a backstabber
me a backstabber
you got a lot of nerve
i saw her first
hey i couldnt help it if she found me irresistable
mary rolls her eyes at this
but you knew how crazy i was about her
yeah and you knew how crazy i was about fraida felcher but that didnt stop you did it
waning righteousness what are you talking about
dont deny it lloyd
fraida told me the whole sordid story
lloyd cant muster a defense
i was gonna tell you about that
it was gonna be mentioned at the reading of my will
i swear you can ask my lawyer
harry glares at him
well i guess we both learned a little something about each other didnt we
you said it pal
maybe were not as good friends as we thought we were
i mean if one beautiful girl could rip us apart like this then it seems our friendship isnt worth a damn
beat maybe we should call it quits right here
just tell me where to sign bud
suddenly they hear the metallic click clack of a gun being okay which one of you losers wants to die first
the guys exchange a look and swallow hard
i wouldnt pull that trigger if i were you
itll look like just another aspen love triangle
you caught the two of them in bed handcuffed them to the post murdered them and killed yourself
smug except youre forgetting one minor etail
lloyd and mary look at harry hopeful
if you kill us youd be killing yourself
you see philosophers believe that were all really just tiny pieces of one huge universal being
in other words i am you and you are me so if you were to kill us youd be committing suicide you unenlightened idiot shut up
mary sees that theyre in deep shit now
what about my husband
did you kill him too
marys married harry
no need to worry about melvin
beat now this is the last time ill ask who wants to die first
harry gestures with his head at mary
the bitch shouldve told him she was married back at the airport
it wouldve saved us a lot of trouble
andre points the gun at mary
no ill go first harry
i was the one who got you into this mess
andre points the gun at lloyd
no wait do me first
im the one who stole your girl lloyd
i eserve it
andre sighs and points the gun at harry
then as mary and lloyd look on in horror he fires twice
harry grabs his stomach and falls off the bed to the floor
you killed my best friend you bastard
if its any consolation youre about to be reunited
he aims the gun at lloyd cocks the trigger
suddenly a shot rings out and the gun is blown out of andres hand
on the floor harry is very much alive and pointing a pistol at the stunned nicholas andre
just them the door bursts open and several police officers storm in with their weapons drawn
get your hands up asshole
lloyd and harry throw their hands into the air
a stunned andre turns to see six guns pointing at his head
he reluctantly raises his hands
mary and lloyd are flabbergasted by the turn of events
theres a sudden commotion in the room
pushing her way through the mass of cops comes the athletic beauty
she flashes an id
special officer kathryn frick
federal bureau of investigation
dumbstruck you gotta be kidding
good work harry
lloyd looks to his friend confused
harry opens his shirt revealing a bullet proof vest
she grabbed me down in the lobby and explained what was up
they slapped this on me and gave me a gun
to athletic beauty but how did you
weve been following you two all the way from providence
swanson had a homing device plated in the briefcase
the guys glance guiltily at one another
yeah about that dough
every bill was counterfeit and marked
harry and lloyd exhale a sigh of relief
theres a swarm of onlookers as andre and j
shay are hustled into a police car and driven away
while mary talks to the police harry and lloyd stare at her lovingly
shes something aint she har
you were right lloyd
she was efinitely worth the trip
guess we have to admit it she was too good for us
just then a cruiser pulls up and marys husband jumps out
oh god baby i missed you
harry and lloyd stare in wonder as mel gibson climbs out of the car
mary and mel embrace then mel turns to the guys
i cant thank you enough fellas
it was so darn dank in that well i really thought it would be the death of me
harry and lloyd are too stunned to respond
they look at each other and we lloyd and harry come out of the elevator with their meager luggage but this time nobody rushes to their aid
the guys exit the hotel and approach the bell captain barnard
look we just wanted to say that we appreciate all you did for us during our stay
and were um sorry about the money we gave you turning out to be phony
dont worry about it gentlemen
the swanson family has promised to reimburse everyone
this seems to please lloyd and harry
the hearse is delivered to the front door
well anyway thanks again for everything
they turn to go but barnard calls to them where are you two headed
im sure well find a trailer camp somewhere to call home
why not right here
harry and lloyd look at each other confused
this joint is a little out of our budget barney
smiling oh i think we might be able to find you a free room somewhere after all like you once told me were all from the same mold
winks you just dont have any dough right now
the guys are stunned by barnards generous offer
are you on the level
well just slide you into one of the employee rooms
the guys beam at this
provided of course you dont mind working one or two afternoons a week
harry and lloyd lock eyes
then you know what barney i think well take out chances down the road
barnard shakes his head as the two fools climb into their hearse and drive off
as the hearse drives down the road we hear v
since were finished elbow rubbing what next lloyd
i say we head due south and try a little nose rubbing with some of them slinky eskimo babes
now youre talking my language
you know i got a weakness for blondes
