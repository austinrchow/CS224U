shakespeare revision november welcome to padua high school your typical urban suburban high school in portland oregon
smarties skids preppies granolas
loners lovers the in and the out crowd rub sleep out of their eyes and head for the main building
kat stratford eighteen pretty but trying hard not to be in a baggy granny dress and glasses balances a cup of coffee and a backpack as she climbs out of
her battered baby blue dodge dart
a stray skateboard clips her causing her to stumble and spill her coffee as well as the contents of her backpack
the young rider dashes over to help trembling when he sees who his board has hit
cowering in fear he attempts to scoop up her scattered belongings
leave it he persists
kat continuing i said leave it
she grabs his skateboard and uses it to shove him against a car skateboard tip to his throat
he whimpers pitifully and she lets him go
a path clears for her as she marches through a pack of fearful students and slams open the door entering school
bianca stratford a beautiful sophomore stands facing the mirror applying lipstick
her less extraordinary but still cute friend chastity stands next to her
did you change your hair
you might wanna think about it leave the girls room and enter the hallway
bianca is immediately greeted by an admiring crowd both boys and girls alike
adoring hey bianca
the greetings continue as chastity remains wordless and unaddressed by her side
bianca smiles proudly acknowledging her fans
cameron james a clean cut easy going senior with an open farm boy face sits facing miss perky an impossibly cheery guidance counselor
im sure you wont find padua any different than your old school
same little asswipe mother fuckers everywhere
her plastic smile never leaves her face
cameron fidgets in his chair uncomfortably
continuing any questions
i dont think so maam then go forth
scoot ive got deviants to see
cameron rises to leave and makes eye contact with patrick verona a sullen looking bad ass senior who waits outside ms perkys door
his slouch and smirk let us know how cool he is
miss perky looks down at her file and up at patrick continuing patrick verona
i see were making our visits a weekly ritual
she gives him a withering glance
he answers with a charming smile
i missed you
it says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls
it was a bratwurst
i was eating lunch
with the teeth of your zipper
she motions for patrick to enter her office and cameron shuffles out the door bumping into michael eckman a lanky brainy senior who will either end up a politician or
game show host
you the new guy
so they tell me
im supposed to give you the tour
they head out of the office continuing so which dakota you from
i was kidding
people actually live there
were outnumbered by the cows though
how many people were in your old school
how many people go here
most of them evil prom posters adorn the wall
michael steers cameron through the crowd as he points to various cliques
weve got your basic beautiful people
unless they talk to you first dont bother
the beautiful people pass in full jock cheerleader splendor
continuing those re your cowboys
several stetson wearing big belt buckle
wrangler guys walk by
that im used to
yeah but these guys have never seen a horse
they just jack off to clint eastwood
they pass an espresso cart with a group of teens huddled around it
continuing to the right we have the coffee kids
dont make any sudden movements around them
michael continues the tour and these delusionals are the white rastae
several white boys in dreadlocks and jamaican knit berets lounge on the grass
a cloud of pot smoke hovers above them continuing big marley fans
think theyre black
semi political but mostly they watch a lot of wild kingdom if you know what i mean
michael waves to derek the one with the longest dreads
continuing derek save some for after lunch bub
very stoned michael my brother peace cameron turns to follow michael as they walk into the cafeteria
so where do you fit in all this
loud music and loud students
michael sits with a group of studious looking teens
future mbas were all ivy league already accepted
someday ill be sipping merlot while those guys he points to the table of jocks as they torture various passers by
continuing are fixing my saab
yuppie greed is back my friend
he points proudly to the alligator on his shirt
cameron stops listening as bianca walks by and we go slo mo
pure and perfect she passes cameron and michael without a look
cameron is smitten that girl i you burn you pine you perish
who is she
dont even think about it why not
i could start with your haircut but it doesnt matter
shes not allowed to date until her older sister does
and thats an impossibility
a room full of bored seniors doodle and scare off into space ms
blaise the one step away from medication english teacher tries to remember what shes talking about
i guess that does it for our analysis of the old man and the sea
any other comments
with dread kat
kat the girl we saw as we entered the school slowly cakes off her glasses and speaks up
why didnt we just read the hardy boys
this book is about a guy and his fishing habit
not exactly a crucial topic
the other students roll their eyes
continuing frankly im baffled as to why we still revere hemingway
he was an abusive alcoholic misogynist who had a lot of cats
joey dorsey a well muscled jock with great cheekbones makes fun of her from his row
as opposed to a bitter self righteous hag who has no friends
a few giggles
kat ignores him
a practiced gesture thats enough mr
really gets fired up now i guess the school board thinks because hemingways male and an asshole hes worthy of our time she looks up at ms
blaise who is now fighting with her pill box
continuing what about colette
simone de beauvoir
patrick lounging in his seat in the back row elbows a crusty looking crony identified by the name scurvy embroidered on his workshirt
the class titters
kat wears an expression of intolerance kat now sits before miss perky
youve been terrorizing ms
expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action
well yes compared to your other choices of expression this year todays events are quite mild
by the way bobby rictors gonad retrieval operation went quite well in case youre interested
i still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls
i was merely a spectator
the point is kat people perceive you as somewhat
kat smiles at her daring her to say it
i believe heinous bitch is the term used most often
she grimaces as if shes referring to a medical condition
continuing you might want to work on that kat rises from her chair with a plastic smile matching the counselors
as always thank you for your excellent guidance
bianca ignores the droning teacher as she writes a note in big flowing handwriting
i realize the language of mr
shakespeare makes him a bit daunting but im sure youre all doing your best
bianca folds the note and passes it behind her with a flip of her hair to chastity
chastity opens the note and reads chastity frowns to herself
stratford do you care to comment on what youve read so far
bianca looks up and smiles the smile of daddys little girl
the teacher shakes her head but lets it go
a waif like senior girl who sits off to the side trying to slit her wrist with the plastic spiral on her notebook looks up and raises her hand
mandella since youre assisting us you might as well comment
im assuming you read the assignment
uh yeah i read it all the whole play the whole folio
all the plays
disbelieving youve read every play by william shakespeare
she raises a challenging eyebrow
the stunned teacher doesnt answer and goes to call on the next student
mandella and kat sit down in the quiet corner
they are eating a carton of yogurt with gusto
your sister is so amazingly without
shell never read him
she has no idea
kat attacks the fact that youre cutting gym so you can t
sophomore english just to hear his name is a little without in itself if you ask me
kats attention is caught by patrick as he walks by with his friends lighting up a cigarette
mandella notices her staring
patrick verona random skid
thats pat verona
the one who was gone for a year
i heard he was doing porn movies
im sure hes completely incapable of doing anything that interesting
he always look so block e
kat turns back to face mandella and forces her yogurt into mandellas hand
continuing mandella eat
starving yourself is a very slow way to die
just a little
kat sees her wrist whats this
an attempted slit
kat stares at her expressionless
i realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking but killing yourself so you can be with william shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions
youre venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy
but imagine the things hed say during sex
thinks a minute okay say you do it
you kill yourself you end up in wherever you end up and hes there
do you really think hes gonna wanna dace a ninety pound compulsive who failed volleyball
mandellas attention is struck by bianca as she and chastity parade by joey and his cohorts one of the cohorts elbows joey
joey looks up and smiles at bianca
lookin good ladies
bianca smiles her coyest of smiles
back to kat and mandella still watching
doesnt respond michael and cameron observe joeys leers at bianca from their bench in another corner
cowboys eating cue of a can of beans linger on the grass behind them
why do girls like that always like guys like that
because theyre bred to
their mothers liked guys like that and their grandmothers before them
their gene pool is rarely diluted
he always have that shit eating grin
perma shit grin
i wish i could say hes a moron but hes number twelve in the class
and a model
mostly regional stuff but hes rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out
the bell rings and the cowboys stand and spit into their empty bean cans
cameron and michael rise as cameron tries to catch a glimpse of bianca as she walks back inside
continuing you know french
my moms from canada guess who just signed up for a tutor
you mean id get a chance to talk to her
you could consecrate with her my friend
cameron watches as bianca flounces back into the building
kat and mandella walk toward kats car
joey pulls up beside her in his viper
re her dress the vintage look is over kat
havent you been reading your sassy
yeah and i noticed the only part of you featured in your big kmart spread was your elbow
practically spitting theyre running the rest of me next month
he zooms away as kat yanks open the door of her dart
mandella ties a silk scarf around her head as if theyre in a convertible
the people at this school are so incredibly foul
you could always go with me
im sure william has some friends
they watch joeys car as he slows next to bianca and chastity as they walk toward the school bus
need a ride ladies
bianca and chastity cant get in joeys car fast enough
he pulls away with a smile
mandella lowers her sunglasses to watch
thats a charming new development kat doesnt answer but reaches over and puts a tape in the tape deck
the sounds of joyful punk rock fill the car
as they pull out michael crosses in front of them on his moped
kat has to slam the brakes to keep from hitting him yelling remove head from sphincter
michael begins fearfully pedaling as kat peels out angry at the delay
cameron rushes over you all right
he slows to a stop yeah just a minor encounter with the shrew
the mewling rampalian wretch herself
michael putters off leaving cameron dodging patricks grimy grey jeep a vehicle several years and many paint jobs away from its former glory as a regulation mail truck as he
sideswipes several cars on his way out of the lot
sharon stratford attractive and focused sits in front of her computer typing quickly
a shelf next to her holds several bodice ripper romance novels bearing her name
kat stands behind her reading over her shoulder as she types
undulating with desire adrienne removes her crimson cape revealing her creamy walter stratford a blustery mad scientist type obstetrician enters through the front door wearing a doctors white jacket and
carrying his black bag
i hope dinners ready because i only have ten minutes before mrs
johnson squirts out a screamer
he grabs the mail and rifles through it as he bends down to kiss sharon on the cheek
in the microwave
to kat make anyone cry today
but its only four thirty
bianca walks in
continuing whereve you been
eyeing walter nowhere
she kisses him on the cheek hello precious
walter kisses bianca back as kat heads up the stairs how touching
walter holds up a letter to kat whats this
it says sarah lawrence
snatches it away from him
i guess i got in sharon looks up from her computer
whats a synonym for throbbing
sarah lawrence is on the other side of the country
i thought we decided you were going to school here
at u of
is there even a question that we want her to stay
kat gives bianca an evil look then smiles sweetly at ask bianca who drove her home swollen
to bianca upset who drove you home
bianca glares at kat then turns to walter now dont get upset
daddy but theres this boy
and i think he might ask
youre not dating until your sister starts dating
end of discussion
what if she never starts dating
then neither will you
and ill get to sleep at night
but its not fair shes a mutant daddy
this from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips
he pulls out a small tape recorder from his black bag
continuing do you know what this is
he hits the play button and shrieks of pain emanate from the tape recorder
in unison by rote the sound of a fifteen year old in labor
this is why youre not dating until your sister does
but she doesnt want to date
exactly my point his beeper goes off and he grabs his bag again continuing jesus
can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating
to sharon as he leaves youre not helping
cameron sits with an empty chair beside him
bianca arrives in a flurry of blonde hair
can we make this quick
roxanne korrine and andrew barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break up on the quad
well i thought wed start with pronunciation if thats okay with you
not the hacking and gagging and spitting part
looking down okay
then how bout we try out some french cuisine
bianca smiles slowly youre asking me out
thats so cute
whats your name again
embarrassed forget it
bianca seizes an opportunity
no no its my fault we didnt have a proper introduction cameron
the thing is cameron im at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser
i cant date until she does
seems like she could get a date easy enough
she fingers a lock of her hair
he looks on dazzled
the problem is shes completely anti social
she used to be really popular when she started high school then it was just like she got sick of it or something
thats a shame
she reaches out and touches his arm gosh if only we could find kat a boyfriend
let me see what i can do
cameron smiles having no idea how stupid he is a frog is being torn asunder by several prongs and picks
michael and cameron go for the spleen
youre in school for one day and you ask out the most beautiful girl
do you have no concept of the high school social code
cameron grins away i teach her french get to know her dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me
unlikely but even so she still cant go out with you
so whats the point
cameron motions with his head toward patrick a few lab tables away
hes wearing biker glasses instead of goggles as he tries to revive his frog
what about him
confused you wanna go out with him
the others at the lab table raise their eyebrows impatient no he could wrangle with the sister
liking the intrigue
what makes you think hell do it
he seems like he thrives on danger no kidding
hes a criminal
i heard he lit a state trooper on fire
he just got out of alcatraz
they always let felons sit in on honors biology
im serious man hes whacked
he sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers
forget his reputation
do you think weve got a plan or not
did she actually say shed go out with you
thats what i just said michael processes this
you know if you do go out with bianca youd be set
youd outrank everyone
strictly a list
with me by your side
i thought you hated those people
hey ive gotta have a few clients when i get to wall street
a cowboy flicks the frogs heart into one of the coffee kids latte
cameron presses on over the melee
so now all we gotta do is talk to him
he points to patrick who now makes his frog hump another frog with full on sound effects
ill let you handle that
boys and a few stray girls nail their pieces of wood michael sits next to pepe a coffee kid who holds out his jacket like the men who sell watches
in the subway
inside several bags of coffee hang from hooks
some people like the colombian but it all depends on your acidity preference
i prefer east african and indonesian
you start the day with a sumatra boengie or maybe and ethiopian sidamo in your cup youre that much farther ahead than someone drinkin cosia rican or kona you know
what i mean
michael nods solemnly
patrick sits at a table with scurvy making something that looks like a machete out of a two by four
cameron approaches full of good natured farm boy cheer hey there in response patrick brandishes a loud power tool in his direction
cameron slinks away
continuing later then
michael watches shaking his head
joey and his pals take turns drawing boobs onto a cafeteria tray with a magic marker
michael walks up and sits between them casual as can be hey
are you lost
nope just came by to chat we dont chat
well actually i thought id run an idea by you
you know just to see if youre interested
he grabs michael by the side of the head and proceeds to draw a penis on his cheek with the magic marker
michael suffers the indignity and speaks undaunted
grimacing hear me out
you want bianca dont you
joey sits back and cackles at his drawing
continuing but she cant go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her
does this conversation have a purpose
so what you need to do is recruit a guy wholl go out with her
someone whos up for the job
michael points to patrick who makes a disgusted face at his turkey pot pie before he rises and throws it at the garbage can rather than in it
i heard he ate a live duck once
everything but the beak and the feet
exactly joey turns to look at michael
whats in it for you
oh hey nothin man purely good will on my part
he rises to leave and turns to the others
continuing i have a dick on my face dont i
michael stands at the sink trying to scrub joeys artwork off his face as cameron watches
you got him involved
like we had a choice
besides when you let the enemy think hes orchestrating the battle youre in a position of power
we let him pretend hes calling the shots and while hes busy setting up the plan you have time to woo bianca
cameron grins and puts an arm around him youre one brilliant guy michael pulls back noticing other guys filing in
hey i appreciate gratitude as much as the next guy but its not gonna do you any good to be known as new kid who embraces guys in the bathroom
cameron pulls back and attempts to posture himself in a manly way for the others now watching
kat and mandella pick apart their pad thai
mandella is smoking
so he has this huge raging fit about sarah lawrence and insists that i go to his male dominated puking frat boy number one golf team school
i have no say at all
william would never have gone to a state school
william didnt even go to high school thats never been proven neither has his heterosexuality
mandella replies with a look of ice
kat uses the moment to stub out mandellas cigarette
continuing i appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death but im consuming
pointing at her food do you mind
does it matter
if i was bianca it would be any school you want precious
dont forget your tiara
they both look up as patrick enters
he walks up to the counter to place his order
mandella leans toward kat with the glow of fresh gossip janice parker told me he was a roadie for marilyn manson
patrick nods at them as he takes his food outside
janice parker is an idiot patrick sits before miss perky eating his thai food looking at chart i dont understand patrick
you havent done anything asinine this week
are you not feeling well
touch of the flu
im at a loss then
what should we talk about
your year of absence
he smiles his charming smile how bout your sex life
she tolerates his comment with her withering glance
why dont we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid
whats to discuss
you werent abused you arent stupid and as far as i can tell youre only slightly psychotic so why is it that youre such a fuck up
well you know theres the prestige of the job title
and the benefits package is pretty good
the bell rings
go do something repugnant and give us something to talk about next week
several pairs of tutors and students sit at the various desks
mandella sits with trevor a white rasta
she attempts to get him to do geometry but he stares at her as if smitten look its really easy
youre a freedom fighter
be proud sister
mandella sets down her pencil and closes the book
rotely its mandella with two ls
i am not related to nelson mandela
i am not a political figure
i do not live in south africa
my parents just spent a few too many acid trips thinking they were revolutionaries
but you freed our people your people are white suburban high school boys who smoke too much hemp
i have not freed you trevor
grabbing his arm dramatically only you can free yourself
across the room bianca and cameron sit side by side cozy as can be cesc ma tete
this is my head right
youre ready for the quiz
i dont want to know how to say that though
i want to know useful things
like where the good stores are
how much does champagne cost
stuff like chat
i have never in my life had to point out my head to someone
thats because its such a nice one
she shuts her book and puts on a seductive smile continuing how is our little find the wench a date plan progressing
well theres someone i think might be biancas eyes light up show me cameron and bianca lean against the wall inconspicuously
bianca plays it cool
give me a sign when he walks by
and dont point
the bell rings
kids flood past
then patrick saunters by with scurvy
cameron nudges bianca
out of desperation cameron awkwardly lunges across patricks path
patrick shoves him back against the wall without a thought
cameron lands in a thud at biancas feet
i guess he didnt see me calling after patrick some other time bianca watches patrick a wicked gleam in her eye
my god hes repulsive
hes so perfect
several volleyball games are being played
joey and a member of his hulking entourage approach patrick who still manages to look cool even in gym clothes
they pull him aside roughly
shrugging them off what
joey points joey see that girl
patrick follows his line of vision to kat as she spikes the ball into some poor cowboys face
yeah what do you think
kat wins the game and high fives the others who are scared of her
two legs nice rack
i want you to go out with her
ill get right on it
you just said you need money to take a girl out but youd go out with her if you had the cake
patrick stares at joey deadpan
his dislike for the guy obvious
sarcastic yeah id take her to europe if i had the plane
you got it verona
i pick up the tab you do the honors
youre gonna pay me to take out some girl
i cant date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend
and thats the catch
she doesnt want a boyfriend
twenty bucks each time you take her out
i cant take a girl like that out on twenty bucks
patrick raises an eyebrow urging him up continuing take it or leave it
this isnt a negotiation
fifty and youve got your man
patrick walks away with a smile kat and the rest of the team go through a grueling practice session
kat spares no one as she whips the ball all over the field
patrick sits on the bleachers nearby watching
a cigarette dangles from his mouth
his pal scurvy is next to him
chapin the coach blows the whistle
proudly good run stratford
kat nods in response and the girls leave the field
patrick hops down to follow
kat stops and turns slowly to look at him
continuing i mean wo man
how ya doin
smiles brightly sweating like a pig actually
theres a way to get a guys attention
my mission in life
she stands there undaunted hand on hip
continuing obviously ive struck your fancy
so you see it worked
the world makes sense again
patricks eyes narrow
he steps closer
pick you up friday then oh right
patrick backs up a little
he uses his most seductive tone the night i take you to places youve never been before
the eleven on burnside
do you even know my name screwboy
i know a lot more than that kat stares at him
she walks away quickly leaving him standing alone
calling after her youre no bargain either sweetheart
scurvy appears at his side so i guess the jeep wont be getting a new blaupunkt
across the field cameron and michael watch
he took the bait
kat washes her face at the sink
bianca appears behind her and attempts to twist kats hair into a chignon
she wacks bianca away
have you ever considered a new look
i mean seriously you could have some potential buried under all this hostility
kat pushes past her into the hallway
i have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you dont get out of my way
can you at least start wearing a bra
kat slams her door in response
patrick scurvy and some other randoms head for the exit scurvy you up for a burger
patrick looks in his wallet
kat stands at her locker gathering her books
patrick appears at her side smiling
hey kat doesnt answer continuing you hate me dont you
i dont really think you warrant that strong an emotion
then say youll spend dollar night at the track with me
and why would i do that
come on the ponies the flat beer you with money in your eyes me with my hand on your ass
you covered in my vomit
she slams her locker shut and walks away kat emerges from a music store carrying a bag of cds in her teeth and fumbling through her purse with both hands
she finds her keys and pulls them out with a triumphant tug
she looks up and finds patrick sitting on the hood of her car nice ride
kat takes the bag out of her mouth
are you following me
i was in the laundromat
i saw your car
thought id say hi
hi she gets in and starts the car
youre not a big talker are you
depends on the topic
my fenders dont really whip me into a verbal frenzy
she starts to pull out and is blocked by joeys viper which pulls up perpendicular to her rear and parks
joey and his groupies emerge and head for the liquor store continuing hey do you mind
not at all they continue on into the store
kat stares at them in disbelief
then backs up her vintage fenders crash into the door of joeys precious viper
patrick watches with a delighted grin joey races out of the liquor store
continuing you fucking bitch
kat pulls forward and backs into his car again
walter paces as kat sits calmly on the couch
my insurance does not cover pms then tell them i had a seizure
is this about sarah lawrence
you punishing me
i thought you were punishing me
why cant we agree on this
because youre making decisions for me
as a parent thats my right so what i want doesnt matter
you dont know what you want
you wont know until youre forty five and you dont have it
emphatic i want to go to an east coast school
i want you to trust me to make my own choices
i want walters beeper goes off christ
i want a night to go by that im not staring a contraction in the face
he walks out leaving kat stewing on the couch
patrick shuts his graffiti encrusted locker revealing joeys angry visage glowering next to him
when i shell out fifty i expect results
im on it watching the bitch trash my car doesnt count as a date
i got her under control
she just acts crazed in public to keep up the image
joey sees through the bluff let me put it to you this way if you dont get any action i dont get any action
so get your ass on hers by the end of the week
joey starts to walk off i just upped my price turning what
a hundred bucks a date
forget her sister then
joey thinks for a frustrated moment punches the locker then peels another fifty out of his wallet with a menacing scowl
you better hope youre as smooth as you think you are verona
patrick takes the money with a smile
cameron runs a sentence past bianca
la copine et i ami
bianca glares at him
a copine is someone you can count on
an ami is someone who makes promises he cant keep
cameron closes the french book you got something on your mind
i counted on you to help my cause
you and that thug are obviously failing
arent we ever going on our date
he melts you have my word
as a gentleman youre sweet
she touches his hand
he blushes at her praise and watches her toss her hair back appreciative how do you get your hair to look like that
ebers deep conditioner every two days
and i never ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment
cameron nods with interest
you know i read an article about that
bianca looks surprised
patrick stands at the sink washing his hands michael and cameron cower in the corner watching him
without turning around say it clearing his throat what
whatever the hell it is youre standin there waitin to say
cameron bravely steps forward we wanted to talk to you about the plan
patrick turns toward them
the situation is my man cameron here has a major jones for bianca stratford
what is it with this chick
she have three tits
cameron starts to object but michael holds up a hand
i think i speak correctly when i say that camerons love is pure
purer than say joey dorseys
dorsey can plow whoever he wants
im just in this for the cash
cameron starts choking at the thought of joey plowing his beloved bianca
thats where we can help you
so dorsey can get the girl
patrick pat youre not looking at the big picture
joeys just a pawn
we set this whole thing up so cameron can get the girl
he likes the idea of joey being a pawn in this game
you two are gonna help me tame the wild beast
grinning were your guys
and he means that strictly in a non prison movie type of way
yeah well see
he swings the door open and exits leaving michael and cameron grinning at each other
cu on a party invitation as it gets handed out
future princeton grad bogey lowenstein proudly presents a saturday night bash at his abode
michael holds the invitation up to cameron
this is it
a golden opportunity
patrick can ask katarina to the party
in that case well need to make it a school wide blow out
will bogey get bent
are you kidding
hell piss himself with joy
hes the ultimate kiss ass
michael hands a jock the party invite as they pass each other at the trash cans
the jock calls a fellow jock jock whispers to a cheerleader the cheerleader calls a white rasta that shes making out with showing him the invite
the white rasta tells a cowboy as they run laps during track practice
the cowboy cells a coffee kid as he shields his java from the spray of the shower
joey stands ac his open locker with bianca
the locker is an homage to joeys modeling career
cheesy print ads of him running in a field of daisies petting a kitten etc
adorn the locker door
which do you like better
insert headshots of joey
in one hes pouting in a white shirt
in the other hes pouting in a black shirt
i think i like the white shirt joey nods thoughtfully
its more expensive
exactly beat so you going to bogey lowenbraus thing on saturday
he gives her his best flirtatious smile good cause im not gonna bother if you wont be there
he taps her on the nose and she giggles bianca sits across from cameron whos transfixed as always have you heard about bogey lowensteins party
pouting i really really really wanna go but i cant
not unless my sister goes
im workin on it
but she doesnt seem to be goin for him
continuing shes not a
i found a picture of jared leto in one of her drawers so im pretty sure shes not harboring same sex tendencies
so thats the kind of guy she likes
all ive ever heard her say is that shed dip before dating a guy that smokes
cameron furiously takes notes all right
what else is she partial to
patrick plays pool with some random deviant cronies
he looks up when he hears a commotion at the door
lou the bouncer is in the midst of throwing michael and cameron out
lou its okay
theyre with me
lou looks at patrick surprised then reluctantly lets our two non deviants pass through
patrick guides them to a table and sips from a beer
continuing whatve you got for me
ive retrieved certain pieces of information on miss katarina stratford i think youll find helpful
cameron pulls out a piece of paper
to patrick one question before we start should you be drinking alcohol when you dont have a liver
cameron looks up at patrick
she hates smokers its a lung cancer issue her favorite uncle dead at forty one
patrick sits up are you telling me im a spits the word out non smoker
just for now
bianca said that kat likes pretty guys
this is met with silence
you dont think im pretty
michael smacks cameron hes pretty
i wasnt sure cameron goes back to the list
continuing okay likes thai food feminist prose and angry stinky girl music of the indie rock persuasion
so what does that give me
im supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who cant play their instruments
ever been to club skunk
gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night

patrick groans i also retrieved a list of her most recent cd purchases courtesy of american express

michael puts a finger to his lips
i prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows
im likin you guys better he looks down at the list of cds
continuing this is really music
music blares in a room with minimalist decor splashed with indie rock band posters and flyers
kat and mandella dance as they dress and apply make up bianca enters interrupting their fun
can you turn down the screaming menstrual bitches
im trying to study
kat doesnt move so bianca crosses to the stereo turning down the volume
continuing dont tell me youre actually going out
on a school night no less
kat shoots her a glare continuing excited oh my god does this mean youre becoming normal
it means that gigglepuss is playing at club skunk and were going
disappointed oh i thought you might have a date beat i dont know why im bothering to ask but are you going to bogey lowensteins party saturday night
what do you think
i think youre a freak
i think you do this to torture me
and i think you suck
she smiles sweetly and shuts the door behind her
kat doesnt bat an eye
she grabs her purse and opens the door lets hit it
a happy black and white neon skunk sprays fine mist on the line of kids below
kat and mandella walk in mandella nervously pulling out her fake id
the giant afroed bouncer bruce looks typically mono syllabic
whispering to kat you think thisll work
they approach bruce
kat puts on her happy shiny face continuing hello
wed like two for gigglepuss
bruce looks the girls up and down
i can count
he looks at their ids
mandella gently moves kat aside wearing a face that could only be described as i am a victorias secret model
ill bet you can
she sticks out her chest and licks her lips
bruce stares at her deadpan and hands her back the ids
to mandella and you all come hither yes
take it easy on the guys in there
mandella winks at him and sashays inside kat follows behind shaking her head
patricks mail truck clatters to a stop out front
patrick walks up to bruce whos frisking a badly mowhawked pierced eyebrow boy
bruce pulls a switchblade out of the boys inside pocket
next time leave the bic at home skippy
its a bottle opener
bruce pushes him inside the club then sees patrick
verona my man
always a pleasure brucie
didnt have you pegged for a gigglepuss fan
arent they a little too pre teen belly button ring for you
fan of a fan
you see a couple of minors come in
never padua girls
one tall decent body
the other one kinda short and undersexed
just sent em through
patrick starts to go in continuing hey what happened to that chick you brought last time
the one with the snake
patrick laughs and goes into the club onstage the all female band gigglepuss is parlaying their bad girl sass into a ripping punk number
near the stage is a joyful mass of pogo ing teens at the bar patrick bellies up and looks around the club
gigglepuss finishes a song
hello out there
were gigglepuss and were from olympia
a teenage boy in the audience takes the opportunity to scream
pet my kitty
meow they rev into their next song
mandella and kat glow with sweat
when they hear the opening chords of the song they look at each other and scream with glee as they begin to dance
they couldnt be having a better time
patrick signals to get the bartenders attention and looks across the bouncing surge of the crowd
he spots kat and mandella singing along
the gleeful kat dancing and looking completely at ease
none of her usual attitude
patrick is transfixed
and most definitely attracted
near the stage kat looks at mandella
shouting i need agua
she makes her way through the crowd to the bar
at the bar she made it
she signals for the bartender and as shes waiting looks around
she spots patrick a few feet away continuing to herself shit she sneaks a glance
hes staring but this time he looks away before she can
despite herself shes miffed
the bartender arrives shouting what can i get you
she looks at patrick again
hes completely absorbed in the band
the bottled water arrives and she marches off forgetting to pay
she walks up to patrick
continuing youre not fooling anyone
patrick looks at her surprised yelling hey
great show huh
yelling if youre planning on asking me out you might as well get it over with
yelling excuse me
yelling thats what you want isnt it
yelling gesturing toward the band do you mind
youre sort of ruining it for me
and watches him watch the band yelling youre not surrounded by your usual cloud of smoke
the band takes a break so they can stop yelling now i know
he leans back making no attempt to hit on her
she moves closer
he motions toward the stage you know these guys are no bikini kill or the raincoats but theyre right up there
you know who the raincoats are
why dont you
shes completely taken aback
he uses the moment to his advantage and brushes her hair back as he speaks right into her ear
continuing i watched you out there ive never seen you look like that kat steps away brushing the hair back that he just touched her cheeks pinken
his cocky side is back in a flash continuing come to that party with me
at that moment the band starts another song yelling what
the bartender approaches
to kat yelling you forgot to pay
yelling i got it rick
he tosses some bills on the bar rather than thank him kat simply watches him trying to figure out his motive
continuing yelling nine thirty then
a few people have gotten between them at the bar and she cant hear a word hes saying
she gives him one last look and heads back into the crowd
she didnt say no this time
the crowd files out of the club kat and mandella amongst them
a theyre walking toward the parking lot patrick coasts by in his truck
the gears grind
he yells out the window
whatd he say
mandella watches kat as she stares after patrick has he importund you with love in honourable fashion
kat glances sharply at her
continuing off her look dont be cruella with me
im in favor of romance
youre the one that wants to march on washington every five minutes
kat pokes her then looks back at the club dreamily
gigglepuss was so beyond
i only wish william could have been here to witness the rebirth of punk rock with us
kat links her arm through mandellas and they head for the car
cameron and michael are at michaels locker
so then she says that she almost didnt wear the kenneth coles with that dress because she thought she was mixing you know genres
and the fact that i noticed and im quoting here really meant something
cameron looks at michael expectantly you told me that part already
hell ive just been going over the whole thing in my head and joey appears over camerons shoulder
dingo boingo cameron and michael look at each other and turn around slowly continuing to michael i hear youre helpin verona
were old friend you and verona
we took bathes together when we were kids
its incredibly obvious that hes lying
joey eyes him then turns to cameron
whats your gig in all this
im just the new guy
joey turns back to michael grabbing the alligator on his shirt and twisting it
you better not fuck this up
im heavily invested
hey its all for the higher good right
joey lets go of michael and shoves cameron against a locker for good measure as he walks away is it about me
kat sits outside waiting for her appointment bored and annoyed
the door opens and miss perky escorts patrick out youre completely demented
cheery see you next week
kat stands and patrick sees her
miss perky watches in horror you two know each other
miss perky grabs kat and shoves her into her office
to patrick dear god stay away from her
if you two ever decided to breed evil would truly walk the earth
patrick gives kat one last look before the door shuts then smiles the lights are on illuminating the yard bianca and chastity stand outside kats room
music is blaring and the door is shut
bianca looks at her watch shes obviously not going
across the carpet two pairs of teenage girl feet sneak past
bianca and chastity teddy bear purses in hand
from the kitchen a rustling is heard
the girls freeze
walter emerges from the kitchen with a mile high sandwich the girls are like statues
daddy i and wherere you going
if you must know we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends
otherwise known as an orgy
its just a party
daddy but i knew youd forbid me to go since gloria steinem over there isnt going she points to kat walkman blaring who comes downstairs wearing a baby tee and
her relaxing at home look is about times sexier than her at school look
she wanders toward the kitchen
walter directs his attention toward kat
do you know about any party
kat shrugs as she comes back out of the kitchen with an apple daddy people expect me to be there
if kats not going youre not going
bianca turns to kat eyes ablaze youre ruining my life because you wont be normal i cant be normal
bogey lowensteins party is normal but youre too busy listening to bitches who need prozac to know that
whats a bogey lowenstein
kat takes off her earphones ready to do battle cant you forget for just one night that youre completely wretched
at least im not a clouted fen sucked hedge pig
bianca tosses her hair
like im supposed to know what that even means
maybe youve heard of him
yeah hes your freak friend mandellas boyfriend
i guess since im not allowed to go out i should obsess over a dead guy too
girls kat stares bianca down i know about the goddamn party
bianca and chastity look at each other thrilled and burst into gleeful screams
a startled walter clutches bianca in a protective hug
its just a party
walter looks dazed
wear the belly before you go
just for a minute he rushes to a cupboard and pulls out a padded faux pregnancy belly
continuing i want you to realize the weight of your decisions
he hangs the belly on her as she stands mortified
you are so completely unbalanced
can we go now
com formatting by
net to bianca promise me you wont talk to any boys unless your sister is present
because shell scare them away
kat stomps to the door grabbing her car keys off the hall table and a sweater from the coat rack
she flings open the door and
there stands patrick
nine thirty right
kats in shock continuing im early
she holds up her keys im driving
he peeks in behind her
who knocked up your sister
bogey a short future mba in a tux greets his guests like a pro handing out cigars and martinis
nice to see you
martini bar to the right shots in the kitchen
the house is filled to capacity with padua highs finest kat pushes through the crowd
patrick saunters in behind her joey lines up a row of shots amid much whooping and hollering within the jock crowd
kat enters then quickly tries to make an about face
joey sees her and rushes over to block her standing in the doorway
lookin fresh tonight pussy kat kat gives him a death look and then stops and points at his forehead
wait was that
did your hairline just recede
he panics whipping out a handy pocket mirror shes already walking away
where ya goin
your sister here
kats face shows utter hatred leave my sister alone
smirking and why would i do that
a ruckus sounds from the next room a fight
the other jocks rush to watch as two coffee kids splash their cupfuls on each other
that was a new guinea peaberry you folgers crystals slurping buttwipe
caffeinated fists fly
joey slithers away from the door to watch giving kat one last smirk just as bianca walks into the kitchen
just who i was looking for
he puts his arm around bianca and escorts her out bianca keeps walking ignoring kat a guy pouring shots hands kat one she downs it and accepts another
drink up sister
patrick walks up whats this
mocking im getting trashed man
isnt that what youre supposed to do at a party
i say do what you wanna do
funny youre the only one she downs another
cameron and michael enter
cameron looks around for his beloved while michael schmoozee with all in attendance and dishes dirt simultaneously
high fiving a jock moose my man
to cameron ranked fifth in the state
recruiters have already started calling
cameron nods intently continuing grabbing his belt yo clem
to cameron a patsy cline fan but hates the new leanne rimes
with a jamaican swagger ziggy peace bra
to cameron prefers a water pipe but has been known to use a bong
michael spots bianca and chastity watching the skirmish and points camerons body in her direction
continuing follow the love man on bianca and chastity bianca cranes her neck where did he go
he was just here
cameron walks over
bianca turns and graces him with a pained smile
looks like things worked out tonight huh
bianca ignores the question and tries to pawn him off you know chastity
i believe we share an art instructor great would you mind getting me a drink cameron
bianca gives him a tense smile
he heads for the kitchen
joey walks up and grabs her around the waist
she giggles as he picks her up and carries her off just as cameron returns a beer complete with a napkin and straw in his hand
chastity glares with a jealous fury after bianca and joey then gives cameron the once over and walks away
extremely unfortunate maneuver
the hell is that
what kind of guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while youre talking to her
but hey youre making progress
no i m not
he smacks himself in the head continuing she used me
she wants to go out with dorsey
im an idiot
michael pats him on the shoulder
at least youre self aware kat and a crowd of white rastas and cowboys stand in a drunken group hug singing i shot the sheriff
kat has another shot glass in hand
patrick is showing a scar to an inebriated enraptured cheerleader
he looks up at kat and smiles meets his eyes then looks away
bianca stands next to joey sipping from her beer so yeah ive got the sears catalog thing going and the tube sock gig thats gonna be huge
and then im up for an ad for queen harry next week
its a gay cruise line but ill be like wearing a uniform and stuff
bianca tries to appear impressed but its getting difficult
my agent says ive got a good shot at being the prada guy next year
he looks over her shoulder and waves at someone
bianca takes the opportunity to escape
ill be right back
bianca shuts the door and leans on it with a sigh
chastity applies lip gloss in the mirror
he practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist
bonchowski is great an all but hes not exactly relevant party conversation
is he oily or dry
i dont know i thought hed be different
more of a gentleman
chastity rolls her eyes bianca i dont think the highlights of dating joey dorsey are going to include door opening and coat holding
sometimes i wonder if the guys were supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with you know
all i know is id give up my private line to go out with a guy like joey
theres a knock at the door
bianca opens it to find a very drunken kat
bianca i need to talk to you i need to tell you cutting her off i really dont think i need any social advice from you right now
bianca grabs chastitys arm and they exit patrick tries to remove a shot glass from kats hand
maybe you should let me have it
kat is fierce in her refusal to let go i want another one joey enters grabbing patrick by the shoulder distracting him from his task
my man as patrick turns kat breaks free and dives into the sea of dancing people in the dining room
annoyed its about time
a deals a deal
he peels off some bills continuing howd you do it
get her to act like a human a very drunken kat jumps up onto the kitchen island and starts dancing by herself
she lets loose hair flying
shes almost burlesque
others form a crowd clapping and cheering her on she swings her head around banging it on a copper pot hanging from the rack above the center island
she starts to sway then goes down as patrick rushes over to catch her
the others clap thinking this is a wonderful finale
patrick sets her down on her feet holding her up okay
im she tries to push him away but staggers when she does grabs her again bracing her
youre not okay
i just need to lie down for awhile uh uh
you lie down and youll go to sleep i know just let me sleep what if you have a concussion
my dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable
not that i could tell the difference
she tries to sit on the floor okay ill just sleep but stay awake okay
he pulls her back to her cmon lets walk as patrick walks kat through the dining room cameron grabs his arm
cameron we need to talk
cameron im a little busy its off
the whole thing
kat slides down to the floor and patrick struggles to get h back on her feet
what re you talking about
shes partial to joey not me patrick doesnt have time for this
cameron do you like the girl
sure impatient then go get her patrick continues walking an oblivious kat outside
cameron stands there unsure how to make use of this advice patrick marches kat around the yard holding her up this is so patronizing
leave it to you to use big words when youre shitfaced
why re you doing this
i told you you dont care if i die sure i do why
because then id have to start taking out girls who like me
like you could find one see that
who needs affection when ive got blind hatred
just let me sit down
he walks her over to the swingset and plops her down in a swing moving her hands to hang onto the chains
she sits and looks at him for a moment with a smile
then falls over backward
youre like a weeble patrick rushes to right her then starts pushing her on the swing to keep her entertained
continuing whyd you let him get to you
i hate him
itd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila
you dont seem like the type
holding up a drunken head hey man
you don t think i can be cool
you dont think i can be laid back like everyone else
slightly sarcastic i thought you were above all that you know what they say he stops the swing no
what do they say
kat is asleep her head resting against the swings chains
he drags her to her feet and starts singing loudly
continuing jingle bells
wake up damn it
he sits her down on the slide and shakes her like a rag doll
he sighs with relief
i thought you were
they share some meaningful eye contact
and then she pukes on his shoes
kat washes her face and grabs a bottle of scope taking a big swig
a knock sounds at the door go away bianca opens the door and looks at her sister with the smuggest of all possible grins
dinner taste better on the way out
gives her a dont even start look
continuing i dont get you
you act like youre too good for any of this and then you go totally apeshit when you get here
she pushes past her and leaves the bathroom
kats in the drivers seat
patrick leans in and takes the keys out of the ignition
cute kids loiter on the lawn
bianca and chastity walk outside joey catches up to them
a bunch of us are going to jarets house
chastity looks at bianca who wears a pained expression
she looks at her watch
i have to be home in twenty minutes
eagerly to joey i dont have to be home til two
to bianca maybe next time they head back into the party leaving an astonished bianca cameron exits the party and stops when he sees bianca standing alone
slightly accusatory have fun tonight
tons he starts to walk on continuing cameron
she gives him a helpless smile
continuing do you think you could give me a ride home
patrick drives as kat sits in the passenger seat fiddling with the radio dial
she finds a song shes happy with and patrick quickly changes it
im driving so i get to pick the tunes
she changes it back to her song
its my car
he changes it back
and im in control of it
but its gigglepuss i know you like them
i saw you there
patrick doesnt have an answer for this so he lets her listen to her song
continuing when you were gone last year where were you
busy were you in jail
no you werent then whyd you ask
whyd you lie
he doesnt answer but instead frowns and turns up the music
she bobs her head drunkenly
continuing i should do this
she points to the radio start a band
sarcastically my father wouldnt approve of that that you dont strike me as the type that would ask permission
she turns to look at him
oh so now you think you know me
im gettin there her voice loses its venom the only thing people know about me is that im scary
he turns to look at her she looks anything but scary right now
he tries to hide his smile
yeah well im no picnic myself
they eye each other sharing a moment of connection realizing theyre both created the same exterior for themselves
patrick pulls into her driveway and shuts off the motor
he looks up at her house
continuing so what s up with your dad
he a pain in the ass
he just wants me to be someone im not
no offense but youre sister is without
i know everyone likes her and all but
kat stares at him with new admiration
you know youre not as vile as i thought you were
she leans drunkenly toward him
their faces grow closer as if theyre about to kiss and then patrick turns away so ill see you in school kat stares at him pissed
then gets out of the car slamming the door shut behind her
bianca and cameron ride in silence
he finally breaks it
i looked for you back at the party but you always seemed to be occupied
faux innocence i was
you never wanted to go out with me did you
bianca bites her lip
reluctant well no
then thats all you had to say
but you always been this selfish
bianca thinks a minute he pulls up in front of the house just because youre beautiful doesnt mean you can treat people like they dont matter
she looks at him for a moment then grabs his face and gives him a kiss on the lips
he draws back in surprise then kisses her back
she smiles then gets out of the car without another word
cameron grins and drives away continuing and im back in the saddle
kat sits at her desk burying her face in a book as the others enter
the white rastas are first
kat my lady you sway to the rhythm of my heart
he grabs her hand and kisses it as she pulls it away
clem a cowboy enters high fiving derek with new found friendliness
yippe kai aye bra
to kat dance for me cowgirl
he sits next to derek continuing okay now tell me again why he didnt shoot the deputy
because the deputy meant him no harm my friend
it was only the sheriff that was the oppressor
joey saunters in and takes his seat
kat babe you were on fire
blaise enters and sits at her desk well now did everyone have a good weekend
maybe we should ask verona patrick enters late and slinks to his desk
kat looks up down and around everywhere but at patrick
blaise tries to remember what shes supposed to talk about
beat oh yes she clears her throat
continuing id like you all to write your own version of shakespeares sonnet
continuing any form youd like
rhyme no rhyme whatever
id like to see you elaborate on his theme however
lets read it aloud shall we
the class is frozen in apathy
blaise hands him the sonnet
he shifts uncomfortably in his seat
reading in his rasta stoner drawl in faith i do not love thee with mine eyes for they in thee a thousand errors note but tis my heart that loves
what they despise who in despite of view is pleas d to dote
in the back of the room clem raises his hand ms
blaise can i get the bathroom pass
damn if shakespeare dont act as a laxative on my person
kat and mandella scrape the peanuts out of their sauce
you went to the party
i thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity
i didnt have a choice
you didnt have a choice
wheres kat and what have you done with her
i did bianca a favor and it backfired
you didnt i got drunk
i got rejected
it was big fun
patrick enters walking to the counter to order
he sees kat and smiles
hey she gathers her things and bolts out the door
patrick looks at mandella who shrugs and follows kat
biology class day cameron and michael flank patrick at his lab table so you got cozy with she who stings
no ive got a sweet payin job that im about to lose
whatd you do to her
i don t know
beat i decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it
michael and cameron look at each other in realization then turn back to patrick
you realize this puts the whole operation in peril
she wont even look at me why cant you just tell her youre sorry
patricks expression says that this is not a possibility
michael makes a time out sign with his hands
im on it mandella is at her locker
drawings of william shakespeare adorn the door
she looks at them with a sigh then ties her silk scarf tightly around her neck in an attempt to cut off her air supply
michael walks up
tired of breathing
shyly as she loosens the scarf hi
you a fan
she looks at him suspiciously who could refrain that had a heart to love and in that heart courage to make b love known
michael thinks for a minute
happily stunned right
kat a fan too
he leans in close to her conspiratorially so listen
i have this friend cameron sits next to patrick on the bleachers as they watch kats practice
she hates you with the fire of a thousand suns
thats a direct quote she just needs time to cool off ill give it a day
a puck flies at them from the field narrowly missing their heads
continuing maybe two
he looks at cameron
continuing you makin any headway
she kissed me
eyebrow raised where
chastity rounds the corner and bends down to get a drink from the water fountain
joey stands talking to two jock cohorts
the guys dont see her
dont talk to me about the sweetest date
that little halo bianca is gonna be prone and proven on prom night
six virgins in a row
the cohorts chortle chastity keeps drinking from the fountain joey leans against patricks jeep
patrick is inside
i dont know dorsey
another hundred for the tux enough with the barbie n ken shit
he pulls out his wallet and hands patrick a wad of money continuing take it patrick does with a smile as he roars out of the parking lot
kat and mandella deface a prom flyer
can you even imagine
who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess
well i guess were not since we dont have dates
listen to you
you sound like betty all pissed off because archie is taking veronica
okay okay we wont go
its not like i have a dress anyway you re looking at this from the wrong perspective
were making a statement
unconvinced oh good
something new and different for us
chapin patrols as boys and girls shoot arrows at targets joey swaggers up to bianca who is taking careful aim
chastity watches from across the row
hey sweet cheeks
not looking at him hi joey
youre concentrating awfully hard considering its gym class
she lets the arrow go and turns to look at him
continuing listen i want to talk to you about the prom
you know the deal
i can t go if kat doesnt go in the background a rasta crumples to the ground
hit a casualty of gym
chapin scurries over
your sister is going
bianca looks at him surprised since when
joey takes the bow and arrow from biancas hand
he draws back and takes aim
im taking care of it
chastity looks over from her spot on the field but keeps lips firmly shut
kat browses through the feminist lit section patrick appears through a hole in the books
excuse me have you seen the feminine mystique
i lost my copy
frowning what are you doing here
i heard there was a poetry reading
you re so pleasant
kat stares at him deadpan
i guess someone still has her panties in a twist
dont for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties
so what did i have an effect on
other than my upchuck reflex
she pushes past him and heads out the door pat looks down at the book hes been holding in his hand taming of the shrew
cameron and michael flank patrick as he shovels food into mouth
you were right
shes still pissed
sweet love renew thy force
man dont say shit like that to me
people can hear you
exasperated you humiliated the woman
sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score
best case scenario youre back on the payroll for awhile
whats the worst
you get the girl
patrick thinks for a minute if i go down
im takin her with me kat and the other students sit at their desks taking a quiz patricks seat is conspicuously empty
from outside we hear the soft unsure beginnings of a song
kat looks up then out the window horrified
the song grows louder until we realize its the partridge familys i think i love you
being sung by patrick
this morning i woke up with this feeling i didnt know how to deal with and so i just decided to myself the students rush to the window
outside patrick stands beneath the window crooning
scurvy is next to him keeping the beat on the bongos and doing backup vocal s
id hide it to myself
and never talk about it
and didnt i go and shout it when you walked into the room he makes quite a sarcastic show of it
blaise touches her heart as if the song is for her
kat slowly walks to the window peeking below
patrick smiles at her as he finishes the verse with a big finale
continuing i think i love you i the other students laugh clap cheer etc
kat sinks down mortified but with a slight smile patrick and several other miscreants sit quietly mulling over their misfortune
nice song verona
he makes the appropriate hand gesture mr
chapin the gym teacher sits at the desk in front ignoring them while he reads a girly weightlifting magazine excuse me mr
patrick looks up at the sound of her voice and sees kat standing in the doorway
she gives him a smile and he perks up a little
kat walks into the room and addresses mr
he turns fully to face her
sir id like to state for the record that mr
verona s current incarceration is unnecessary
i never filed a complaint
you didnt have to
he disrupted a classroom
kat glances over at patrick and motions her head toward the window
patrick shrugs not knowing what she s talking about
she motions again and looks toward the window with an expression that says make a break for it moron
kat brings her attention back to mr
chapin while patrick inches out of his seat toward the window
the other miscreants watch with glee
chapin i hardly think a simple serenade warrants a week of detention
there are far more hideous acts than off key singing being performed by the student body on a regular basis
patrick is halfway out the window now
and none too happy about it considering theyre on the second floor
he eyes a large tree a few feet away from mr
he starts to turn away from kat youre not gonna change my mind kat
kat starts to panic as patrick has yet to make the jump for the tree
theres something ive always wanted to show you
he turns back toward her again the very second before he would have spotted patrick
kat glances toward the window
patricks just about to make the jump
from behind we see her lift up her shirt and flash her bra at mr
chapin just as patrick makes the jump
the miscreants cheer for both the daring escape and the flash of skin
chapin reddens and tries to be stern
im going to let that slide katarina
but if i catch you doing that again youll be in here with the rest of these guys
he motions to the remaining detention prisoners without noticing patricks absence
kat smiles at him
thank you mr
kat bolts out the door
chapin goes back to his muscle mag wiping the sweat from his brow
kat arrives at the tree
looking around breathlessly seeing no one
i sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me
look up sunshine she does
hes still in the tree i guess i never told you im afraid of heights
its not that bad try lookin at it from this angle she assesses the branch structure put your right foot there forget it
you want me to climb up and show you how to get down
voice trembling maybe
she sighs and dose so
when she gets to his level she perches on the branch next to him
he grins at her
then swings himself down with the grace and ease of a monkey leaving her sitting there realizing shes been duped
she climbs down after him patrick and kat walk amongst the games the partridge family
i figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect
and piss you off
so howd you get chapin to look the other way
i dazzled him with my wit she stops and picks up a toy gun that shoots water at giggling hyenas and wails on it
the barker hands her a stuffed animal as her prize
she hands it to the small kid next to her and they continue walking
sarcastic a soft side
yeah well dont let it get out so whats your excuse
acting the way we do
yes i dont like to do what people expect
then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change
so if you disappoint them from the start youre covered
something like that then you screwed up how
you never disappointed me
she blushes under his gaze continuing you up for it
he motions to the sign for a paint ball game
she grins the two of them creep through the paint ball course stealthy and full of the desire to best the other
patrick nails kat in the back with a big glob of red paint kat gets him in the chest with a glob of blue
patrick returns fire with a big yellow splat to the side of her face
kat squirts a green shot to his forehead after a few more shots theyre both covered in paint she tries to shoot him again only to find that her gun
continuing damn it
patrick grabs her in a victorious tackle
they land laughing
its hard to even recognize them as their hair and faces are so smeared with paint globs but they still manage to find each others eyes
he wipes a smear of blue paint away from her lips as he goes to kiss her
nearby the kid with the stuffed animal points look mom his mother hurries him away
whats started as a tackle has turned into a passionate kiss patrick pulls up in kats driveway
their paint wardrobe has dried by now and they look like refugees from some strange yet colorful war
i know the porn careers a lie
he shuts off the car and turns to her
he kisses her neck
tell me something true
i hate peas
no something real
something no one else knows
in between kisses youre sweet
and completely hot for me
no one else knows youre amazingly self assured
has anyone ever told you that
go to the prom with me kats smile disappears
is that a request or a command
you know what i mean no
no i wont go with you why not
because i dont want to
its a stupid tradition
patrick sits quietly torn
he cant very well tell her he being paid to take her
people wont expect you to go
kat turns to him getting angry
why are you doing this
all of it whats in it for you
he sits silently not looking at her confirming her suspicions
continuing create a little drama
start a new rumor
so i have to have a motive to be with you
you tell me
you need therapy
has anyone ever told you that
quietly answer the question patrick angry nothing
theres nothing in it for me
just the pleasure of your company
he takes out a cigarette
she breaks it in half before she slams the car door and walks into the house
patrick peels out of the driveway
kat turns at the front door and watches him go patrick pulls up to a stop light and waits for
the green he glances over at a drunken homeless guy in the median who has decided that he doesnt need to wear pants
patrick pulls out his wallet takes the wad of money joey gave him and hands it to the homeless guy
cover that up the light turns green and patrick pulls away kat stands at the sink scrubbing paint off of her face bianca taps on the open door
quick question are you going to the prom
kat pushes the door shut with a slam cameron and bianca sit together at their study cubby
she fingers a strand of her hair
then guillermo says if you go any lighter youre gonna look like an extra on
bianca stares at him for a moment
do you listen to this crap
im like boring myself
if i had to hear one more story about your coiffure
he mock stabs himself with a pencil as she giggles and smacks his hand away
continuing i figured youd get to the good stuff eventually
what good stuff
the real you
like my fear of wearing pastels
he looks stricken
continuing im kidding
beat you know how sometimes you just become this persona
and you dont know how to quit
matter of fact no okay youre gonna need to learn how to lie
mandella struggles with the lock on her locker
finally it opens
hanging inside is a beautiful dress inspired by the th century
mandella slowly unpins a note from the dress
trevor walks by and sees her holding the dress
youre gonna look splendiferous in that mandella
mandella looks up sharply shaken from her reverie
continuing thats cool to say
mandella grins it is sharon is at her computer walter at his exercise bike would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a british rear admiral
pirate no question
bianca enters and walks over to walter daddy i want to discuss the prom with you
its tomorrow night the prom
kat has a date
no but its that hot rod joey right
that s who you want me to bend my rules for
hes not a hot rod
whatever that is
youre not going unless your sister goes
end of story
i see that im a prisoner in my own house
im not a daughter
im a possession
bianca storms out
calling out you know what happens at proms
sharon stops her typing and looks up at walter theyll dance theyll kiss theyll come home
let her go
is that what you think happens
kissing isnt what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day
bianca lies on her bed
a knock sounds
kat enters and sits down on the bed muting the tv
kindly listen i know you hate having to sit home because im not susie high school
like you care
i do care
but im a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons not someone else s
i wish i had that luxury
im the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and i cant go because you won t
kat clears her throat joey never told you we went out did he
for a month confused why
self mocking he was like a total babe but you hate joey now i do
back then was a different story
kat takes a deep breath
he said everyone was doing it
so i did it
you did what
continuing on just once
afterwards i told him i didnt want to anymore
i wasnt ready
he got pissed
then he broke up with me
bianca stares at her dumbfounded but after that i swore id never do anything just because everyone else was doing it
and i havent since
except for bogeys party and my stunning gastro intestinal display stunned why didnt you tell me
i wanted to let you make up your own mind about him
if you really thought i could make my own decisions you wouldve let me go out with him instead of helping daddy hold me hostage
kat stands up slowly thats not im not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes
i guess i thought i was protecting you
god youre just like him
just keep me locked away in the dark so i cant experience anything for myself not all experiences are good bianca
you cant always trust the people you want to
i guess ill never know will i
she rises and holds the door open for kat then slams it behind her
a sprinkler cruises the lawn
kat lies in bed staring at the ceiling
she rolls over and picks up the phone
bianca still in her pajamas eats a bowl of cereal while watching i love lucy reruns
a knock sounds come in
kat opens the door and peers in with a grin feel like shopping
bianca looks up hopefully
walter and sharon are in front of the television
walter has the tv guide in hand glasses on
what do you wanna watch
weve got crap crap crap or crap dr
bianca walks into the living room
shes wearing a prom dress
looking away walter scurries takes off his glasses and looks from bianca to sharon
honey you look beautiful
my date should be here in five
im missing something
i have a date daddy
and he s not a captain of oppression like some men we know
the doorbell rings
bianca runs to open it
there stands cameron
he takes in biancas outfit
wow lets go
sharon pulls him back down on the couch to bianca have a great time honey
but who what
the door slams
as sharon looks at walter with a grin a blur rushes down the stairs and out the door
the blur has kat s voice
im going to the prom
see you in a few
the door slams again
walter and sharon are alone what just happened
your daughters went to the prom
did i have anything to say about it
that s what i thought the doorbell rings again
walter opens it to find joey on the porch wearing a tux
im here to pick up bianca
late he slams the door shut kat pulls up in her car emerging resplendent in an ice gown
patrick sits on the steps waiting
in a tux
howd you get a tux at the last minute
his date got convicted
whered you get the dress
its just something i had
you know smiling oh huh look im sorry that i questioned your motives
i was wrong
patrick winces slightly but covers it with a smile no prob
he remains seated
kat fidgets nervously
are you ready
he rises and stares at her taking in her image appreciatively
she blushes and turns away
lets get this over with
a hotel ballroom transformed into a fantasy world
patrick and kat enter kat attempting to deny the romance of it
quite the ostentatious display a cowboy two steps by them dragging some poor girl around look clem even wore his good boots kat steps forward looking around and spots cameron
and bianca dancing cheek to cheek
mandella enters nervously in the long elizabethan gown hair piled on top of her head
she spots kat and hurries over
have you seen him
william he asked me to meet him here
oh honey tell me we havent progressed to full on hallucinations
patrick looks toward the door and taps kat
she turns and points mandella the same way
michael in full shakespearean dress with a new goatee on his chin bows in their direction
mandellas grin couldnt be bigger
michael swashbuckles over to them taking mandellas hand and leading her onto the dance floor
to patrick good sir
patrick rolls his eyes
kat and patrick dance to a slow song
whatever hes whispering into her ear is making her laugh
cam and bianca dance nearby glowing with happiness
she whispers something in his ear and heads for the ladies room bianca walks in positively radiant
chastity emerges from a stall
surprised what are you doing here
chastity checks her hair in the mirror aloof
you think you re the only sophomore at the prom
chastity maintains her snooty tone
and just so you know my date isnt planning on spending most of the night in his backseat
bianca whatre you talking about
joey dorsey is only after one thing your cherry
he practically made a public announcement
appalled bianca storms out
chastity tries to backpedal
continuing i wanted to tell you joey drunk disorderly and pissed off walks in with a few stray jocks also dateless
he zeroes in on cameron now consoling a pissed off bianca
patrick and kat continue to slow dance oblivious to the evil about to erupt
thats where i was last year
shed never lived alone my grandfather died i stayed with her
i wasnt in jail i dont know marilyn manson and ive never slept with a spice girl
i spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching wheel of fortune
end of story
he takes a breath and looks away not meeting her eyes
kat stares at him for a moment and laughs a delighted laugh that s completely adorable
it gets worse you still have your freshman yearbook
hes interrupted by joeys hand on his shoulder
whats bianca doing here with that cheese dick
i didnt pay you to let some little punk ass snake me
michael spots the altercation and dances mandella over to cameron and bianca
to cameron feces hitting fan
cmon michael takes cameron aside leaving mandella and bianca staring after them
michael and cameron approach joey as he continues to taunt patrick who keeps quiet realizing the weight of this situation
continuing joey pal compadre
lets take it easy
joey turns toward michael and cameron
joey you two are in big trouble cameron faces joey
be a man
joey punches cameron in the face taking him by surprise cameron holds his nose as it bleeds onto his tux the various cliques descend angrily and joey is soon surrounded
by seething cowboys coffee kids and white rastas
very uncool my brother im not your brother white boy
the other rastas gasp as if stung by the realization that theyre white
joey turns back to patrick and kat
continuing just so you know shell only spread her legs once
kat looks from joey to patrick not sure what shes hearing
joey pushes through the crowd but a hand drags him back
and she belts the hell out of him thats for making my date bleed she belts him again continuing thats for my sister
and again continuing and thats for me
cliques now descend on joey punching him wildly
and thats for the fourth grade asshole
kat runs down the stairs patrick chasing her wait i
you were paid to take me out
by the one person i truly hate
i knew it was a set up
it wasnt like that
what was it like
a down payment now then a bonus for sleeping with me
i didnt care about the money
he catches up to her now continuing i cared about she turns to face him with a countenance more in sorrow than in anger
you are so not what i thought you were
he grabs her and kisses her to shut her up
after a second she jerks away and flees down the stairs and out of sight
bianca stands at the top of the stairs watching
shes never looked more guilty
kat is sprawled on the couch in sweats wrapped in a blanket watching sixteen candles
when molly ringwald leans across the birthday cake to get a kiss from her dream date kat changes the channel disgustedly settling for an infomercial the phone sits next to
bianca breezes in bearing a cup of tea
are you sure you dont want to come with us
itll be fun
kat takes the tea and gives a weak smile
i m sure
bianca sits down next to her you looked beautiful last night you know
so did you bianca gives her a squeeze then jumps up when the doorbell rings opening the door to a waiting cameron
he peeks his head inside
i hope so
the door shuts behind her as walter enters
was that your sister
she left with some bikers big ones
full of sperm
walter sits down on the arm of the chair and watches the infomercial with kat
continuing i dont understand the allure of dehydrated food
is this something i should be hip to
dreading the answer so tell me about this dance
was it fun
parts of it
the part where bianca beat the hell out of some guy
bianca did what
whats the matter
upset that i rubbed off on her
kat looks up in surprise
continuing you know fathers dont like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives
it means weve become spectators
bianca still lets me play a few innings
youve had me on the bleachers for years
when you go to sarah lawrence i wont even be able to watch the game
hopeful when i go
dont tell me youve changed your mind
i already sent em a check
kat reaches over and gives him a hug int
cafeteria day kat stands grabs a box of cornflakes from the food line
she turns and looks at him id like to express my apologies
looking down i didnt mean for you to get when bianca asked me to find you a boyfriend i had no idea it would turn out so ugly
i would never have done anything to compromise your he trails off when he realizes shes thrown her food tray against the wall and marched off the old kill kill
look back in her eyes
kat stomps up the hallway full of menace biancas english teacher perches on the edge of a desk open book in hand
who can tell me at what point lucentio admits his deception
the door of the classroom flies open and an angry kat stalks in yanking bianca from her chair and dragging her toward the hallway
to the teacher family emergency
bianca tries to pull away as kat drags her by the hair between two rows of lockers
you set me up
i just wanted what
to completely damage me
to send me to therapy forever
i just wanted miss perky walks up ladies
shall we take a trip to my office
miss perky stares at both sisters as they sit before her then focuses on bianca
so youre the real bitch yes
yes im the real bitch
i wanted her to get a boyfriend so i could
apparently this makes me a horrible person
she turns to kat
continuing i swear i didnt know about the money
i didnt even know joey was involved
i would never intentionally hurt you kat
to kat do you care to respond
am i supposed to feel better
like right now
or do i have some time to think about it
just smack her now
bianca rises taking kat by the arm
to miss perky well be getting back to you
what no hug
and bianca leave miss perkys office is that woman a complete fruit loop or is it just me
its just you
blaise faces the class all right
im assuming everyone found time to compose their poems
except for mr
dorsey whos still in icu
nerds in the back high five each other
continuing would anyone care to read theirs aloud
no one moves
then kat slowly stands up
i go patrick looks up
she downs a couple prozac continuing please proceed
kat stands puts on her glasses and takes a deep breath before reading from her notebook
i hate the way you talk to me and the way you cut your hair i hate the way you drive my car i hate it when you stare
she pauses then continues continuing i hate your big dumb combat boots and the way you read my mind i hate you so much it makes me sick it even
makes me rhyme
she takes a deep breath and looks quickly at patrick who stares at the floor
continuing i hate the way youre always right i hate it when you lie i hate it when you make me laugh even worse when you make me cry i
hate it that youre not around and the fact that you didnt call but mostly i hate the way i don t hate you not even close not even a little bit not even any at all
she looks directly at patrick
he looks back this time
the look they exchange says everything
then she walks out of the room the rest of the class remains in stunned silence
kat walks to her car alone
when she opens the door shes greeted with a fender stratocaster guitar reclining in the front seat
she picks it up slowly inspecting every detail then spins around
patrick stands there smiling
a fender strat
you bought this
i thought you could use it
when you start your band
she doesnt answer but hides a smile so he walks closer
continuing besides i had some extra cash
some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl
is that right
yeah but then i fucked up
i fell for her
blushes and looks down
continuing you know its not every day you find a girl wholl flash her tits to get you out of detention
surprised and embarrassed that he found out he takes her upturned face as a sign to kiss her and he does she lets him this time
then breaks it off you cant just buy me a guitar every time you screw up you know
i know he quiets her with another kiss which she breaks off again
and dont just think you can he kisses her again not letting her end it this time
we hear the sounds of music and laughter
patrick is at the barbecue grill flipping burgers
why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill
because i like to torture you
can you get me my freshman yearbook
don t you even dare
on bianca and cameron as they argue on the patio
they do to
they do not
rises to get the yearbook
can someone please tell her that sunflower seeds come from sunflowers
severely making out in a lawn chair
she comes up for a breath
i cant remember a word of shakespeare right now
isnt that weird
michael pulls her back down for another round on kat and she tries to keep him from grabbing the yearbook that bianca now hands her
youre freaked over this arent you
bianca hands her the yearbook hes more than freaked
hes froke flips to a page
id like to call your attention to patrick veronas stunning bad ass look of insert a horrifically nerdy freshman year picture glasses bad hair headgear the works
she holds up the picture for all to view
patrick cringes and throws a handful of pretzels at her
patrick is that a
ask my attorney
kat and bianca huddle over the picture giggling as we crane up and hear a girly punk version of the partridge familys i think i love you
