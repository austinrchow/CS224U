written by jeremy drysdale june a phone rings in the dark
a little light falls from the open window illuminating an old bakelite telephone
it sits on a small table alongside a large amount of empty bottles and a couple of overflowing ashtrays
a three wheeled motorcycle is being driven through the night at great speed
the trike is moving very quickly its headlights cutting through the darkness its wheels sending a spray of sand flying towards us as the driver fights to keep it on
this is phil kaufman and hes in a hurry
two figures are struggling on the floor
the male is naked
the woman sits astride him her movements urgent her breath fast
they appear to be having sex
the trike cuts through the night and we pull back to show desert more desert and then
a giant bright flickering neon sign welcome to the joshua tree inn
that phone still ringing shrill insistent
there is a bed next to the table
it is covered in clothes but there is also a mans shape which now moves
a little more light and it now appears as if our man and woman are struggling
there is fear on her face
still that insistent ringing and the covers suddenly fly off the bed
we see the man from behind as he shakes the sleep away and looks for the damn phone
the woman is screaming now and banging on the mans chest with her fists
he is motionless underneath her
the trike skids to a halt amid a cloud of dust and the driver leaps off
he runs at the door throwing it open in one movement disappearing into the room
a broken striped no entry police band flutters to the ground
the man finally answers the phone
at last the ringing stops
the door bounces back open and we can see the phil walking quickly through the room
as he searches we hear oh my god please help me
i found your number in his pocket and i dont know
i dont know what to do
who are you
i dont know what to do
the man glances into the bathroom and opens some drawers
tell me whos dead
we met in a bar and we had a lot to drink and he just
are you sure hes dead
he looks under the beds
hes really dead
call an ambulance
where are you
joshua tree inn
he checks on top of the wardrobe
have you got a car
call an ambulance
then get out of there
he picks up a sheet of paper from the bedside table and glances at it
he turns and walks past us to the car and for the first time we see phil kaufmans face
the trike skids to a halt outside the small white hospital
there are a couple of press vehicles parked outside and a reporter is recording a piece to camera in the background
phil sits for a moment and then opens the door and walks to the entrance
we move through the reception area up to the nurses station
phil is in conversation with a large woman in a nurses uniform
you wanna run that by me again sir
id like to see gram parsons
they stare at each other
you want to see gram parsons
alone if possible
and would you have a gurney standing by in case i need to move him
she looks carefully at the pyjamas which peek out from under the shabby overcoat
his hair is on end
he is wearing biker boots and is holding an unlit but half smoked cigar
and you are
or perhaps a close relative
phil clears his throat
actually im his road manager
the big nurse smiles mirthlessly
so youre not his physician or a close relative
mister parsons is awaiting a post mortem
he will then be delivered to his family
i suggest you speak to them if you wish to pick through his personal effects
she turns away
now listen here
no you listen here
mister parsons is dead and no longer appears to need a road manager
which makes two of us
the nurse turns and marches down the corridor
phil waits until shes gone and then walks through a door marked admittance only to authorized hospital staff
phil slips off his overcoat and stuffs it into the trash
he tosses away the unlit cigar grabs a white coat from a hook and puts it on
he walks out through another door
phil wanders down the corridor glancing into rooms and checking signs
he pushes open a door marked pathology
the room is empty except for a couple of covered bodies on trolleys
phil checks under the first sheet and recoils at whatever it is which lies beneath
he walks over to the next gurney and lifts the sheet
he stares down at the body visibly moved
how you been
he stands for a moment gripping the gurney and looking down at his friend
then he snaps out of it
well i cant stand around here chatting with you all day
things to do
he wheels the gurney towards the door
phil wheels the gurney down the corridor towards the exit
a doctor in green scrubs approaches and glances down at a clipboard
can i help you
naw im cool thanks
the doctor reads the tag on the bodys toe
what are you doing
just taking some stiff down to neurology
we dont have a neurology department
the doctor grabs the end of the gurney
phil tugs and the doctor tugs back
after a moment phil sighs and shakes his head in frustration
just hold your horses ill go check the paperwork
the doctor holds up his clipboard
i have the paperwork
you have your paperwork
i need to go check my paperwork
he slips through the exit
the doctor waits awkwardly for a few seconds and then pushes open the door
he glances around in surprise but there is no one in sight
phils trike accelerates as it approaches a t junction
to the right the sign points to joshua tree town to the left los angeles
the trike doesnt even slow as it skids left sending a spray of sand and gravel flying across the road
there will be several shots of phil driving through the desert set to music
the trike pulls up outside a rambling old house
two enormous plaster eagles flank the front door a giant harley davidson sign hangs from the roof and theres a six foot flashing neon star in the front window
phil gets out walks up to the door and pulls some keys out of his pocket
phil walks into the room and pours himself a drink
he slumps onto the couch takes a sip and closes his eyes
we see movement behind him as an attractive girl slips through a door and approaches phil from behind
this is susie and she puts her hands over his eyes
martin luther king
susie leans over the back of the chair and gives phil a long slow kiss
she jumps over the couch and resumes kissing this time more passionately
phil tries to pull away with little success
the best time
susie continues regardless phil is now finding it hard to resist
he eventually gives in and they begin to kiss passionately
phil and susie are sitting at the kitchen table
he takes a drag from her cigarette and passes it back
im so sorry baby
yeah out of a job again
would never have happened if you were there
how do you know i wasnt
well if you were you wouldnt have let him die
i was still on staff
he was still my responsibility
they sit quietly for a moment
then so where have you been anyway
she sighs and stands up
how long this time
yeah lets have this conversation again
like you havent just done six weeks on the road
yeah but i usually leave a note
and theres a paycheck involved
susie disappears through the door
phils shoulders sag and he slumps against the wall
then susie reappears with a bottle of jack daniels and a couple of glasses
she pours out two generous measures and hands one to phil
after a moment he gets up and follows her out of the room
susie guides phil to a chair and sits him down
this is a remembrance
she crosses to a record player and turns it on pausing to let down the blind on the way back
in my hour of darkness or similar music fills the room
earnestly he was so beautiful and he understood what my heart was feeling
never laugh again
my inner joy has gone
it evaporated when gram departed
he sang country music in a way that it had never been sung before
it was country rock if you like
and it was kinda catchy
at least the young people seemed to lap it up
its fair to say that when gram parsons died he died a star
it was real kinda
and another light burns out in the desert
gram parsons the standard bearer of the new country music movement is dead following an overdose of drugs
while many of americas young people are today in mourning their parents will view this as another example of how todays drug culture can so easily claim a life
well leave you tonight with the young mans own words
gram parsons wrote a song called in my hour of darkness which contains these words in my hour of darkness
we are back in phils sitting room
fade up on the music to match the reporters words as grams voice fills the room or similar music
in my hour of darkness in my time of need oh lord grant me vision oh lord grant me speed
oh lord grant me vision oh lord grant me speed
susie tenderly throws a blanket over the sleeping phil as the record ends
she turns the light off and the room goes dark
susie walks in with a coffee
she sits beside phil and strokes his head until he wakes
she kisses him and passes him the cup
he sits up and stretches
she leans over to kiss him then stands and starts to tidy
he watches her
she picks up some clothing from near his chair and moves away
he drops another piece of clothing on the same spot
she says nothing and picks it up
he takes a sock off and drops it
it has stopped being a game and started being a statement
she picks the sock up and drops it in his lap
he pushes it back onto the floor
she opens her arms and everything falls to the floor
she walks out of the room and into the kitchen
susie leans on the table staring out of the window
phil walks up behind her
when youre here i spend my time wondering when youre going
and when youre back i wonder where youve been
she turns and walks round to face him
phil you give me laughs and a great time
but im not sure if thats enough
you mean theres more than that
yes theres more than that
theres dependable responsible reliable
theres dull boring normal
you should hook up with someone who works in a bank
i know a guy actually
he has fish for dinner every friday cleans his shoes twice a week and buys his ties in bulk because it works out cheaper that way
ill put you in touch
i dont mind loving a crazy bastard phil
but youve got to be for something and not just against everything
you have to choose something to represent
i represent the combined forces of charm enchantment and exuberance
your job is to arrange other peoples lives
maybe its time to put a little thought into your own
susie walks out of the room
a suburban street of small neat bungalows
we move down the street past house and identical house until we rest outside another that is identical to the rest
the front door opens and a nondescript man emerges carrying a small overnight bag
he carefully locks the door and walks down the path to where a cab waits
we can clearly see new orleans taxi marked on the door
this is stanley parsons grams father
there is a loud banging on the front door
phil glances out of the window and looks momentarily puzzled
he opens the door and a beautiful woman stands on the step
long time no see barbara
dont try and schmooze me kaufman you repellent slimeball
she notices susie standing behind phil
the latest victim
barbara walks past them into the kitchen
susie looks quizzically at phil
barbara calls out from the kitchen
its a lot tidier than i remember
susie raises an eyebrow at phil
who the hell is she
grams ex girlfriend
phil points at his temple as if to say shes nuts
isnt he married
barbara walks back into the hall
welcome to the seventies
what do you want barbara
barbara lights a cigarette
im here to fulfill grams wishes
she waits for him to speak
i have no idea what youre talking about
she holds up an old piece of writing paper
do you know what this is
phil reaches for it but barbara snatches it away
its grams will
she reads it out
to whom it may concern i would like it to be known that it is my wish to leave barbara mansfield my assets and belongings in the event of my
signed ingram cecil parsons
phil looks surprised
did he write that with joined up writing or was it before he knew how
barbara gives a wry smile
still the jester kaufman and still very unfunny
thats not a will barbara and you know it
its better than a will actually
its a signed promise from gram to leave me all his assets and belongings
and anyway its really none of your business what this is
ive come for the guitar
phil shakes his head
he always kept it here
its been a while since you were around barbara
gretchen his wife took it back six months ago
barbara leans forward until their noses are almost touching
i dont believe you kaufman
barbara pushes past phil who gives no resistance
she walks straight over to the couch and starts pulling up the cushions
susie moves to stop her but phil holds her back and lets barbara carry on
phil and susie sit on the sofa an island of calm in a sea of chaos
around them the floor is covered with papers clothing empty record covers torn open cushions and books
a broken drawer is propped against the table
a lampshade hangs crazily from its bearings throwing strange shadows around the room
suddenly susie gets up and kicks a cushion across the room
hey well done
you found the only unbroken thing
why did you let her in
its all part of the grieving process
how can she behave that way
grams not even in the ground yet
phil stares at her
he continues to look at her oddly
dont you freak out on me
do me a favor and get the guitar sweetheart
he disappears into the kitchen
where are you going
i gotta make a call
a man with glasses and an ill fitting black suit does some paperwork
he is surrounded by coffins displaying garish special offer price tickets
the phone rings and the undertaker takes his time answering it
joshua tree obsequies
phil is holding the phone
into phone obsequies
what the hell does that mean
we hear the rest of phils mutter from the phone in the undertakers hand
it means burial
is there anything i can help with
who am i speaking to
phil straightens up
he speaks curtly
yes you can help me as a matter of fact
again we hear phils voice trumpeting out of the phone
the undertaker changes his tone
im sorry ill take a look immediately
he puts down the phone and flicks through a big book
he purses his lips
he wipes his nose with a white silk handkerchief
then he picks up the phone
yeah he was here
although he only just went so hell still be on his way to los angeles airport
big thrill for us here as were only a small facility
nearly got jane mansfield in when she passed through but she got diverted to frisco
the phone sits on the table but the room is empty
susie walks in looks around and leaves
phil is lying down in the back of susies station wagon his feet sticking out of the back
susie comes out of the house carrying the guitar and sits on the steps where she watches him
after a minute what are you doing
these things arent that big
is that a problem
susie is confused
well thats good
phil continues to check out the inside of her car
so what are you up to
its best you dont know
without a word susie gets up and walks into the house
phil lies still
after a moment she reappears with her bag
she flounces theatrically past him and opens the car door
phil gets out of the back
i dont know what this madness is but im not getting involved
well thats the point
i mean i dont know what it is youre planning but im not bailing you out again
she gets into the car and slams the door
she starts the engine and phil stands back but the car doesnt move
after a moment the window winds down
this time im not coming back
she gives him a so there smile
im going to find a man who buys his ties in bulk
she drives away
phil arrives on his trike outside a small house
a man is sitting cross legged on the floor
a joss stick burns beside him and sitar music plays in the background
this is larry osterberg and he is meditating
there is a loud hammering on the door
larry shows no sign of having heard anything
more hammering at the door but still no response
then the letter box creaks open and an eye appears in the slot
after a moment the eye disappears and phils face appears momentarily at the window
the window seems to be slightly higher than phil so his face appears every time he jumps up to peer into the room
then phil is gone
larry expels a big breath
the letterbox creaks opens again and the eye is back
there you are
im looking for larry osterberg
larry sighs and stretches
he gets up slowly gently shakes himself to relax his muscles and walks to the door which he opens
the door is unlocked
phil barrels in and closes the door behind him
he turns to take a look around the room
you larry osterberg
welcome to my house
this might be sarcastic but any nuance is lost on phil who props the guitar up against the wall
whats that noise
manomanjari on the sitar by nikhil banerjee
similar music may be used in this scene phil stares at him
he pops a cigar into his mouth
theres no smoking in here im afraid
phil stares meaningfully at the burning joss stick but puts the cigar away
who are you please
oh im phil kaufman
and how may i help you phil kaufman
id like to hire your car
well i need to pick someone up at the airport
dont you know anyone with a car
yes of course
its just that im told your car is more suitable
in what way is my car more suitable
its a hearse
they both look at each other
larry waits for phil to speak
and how is a hearse going to be suitable for picking someone up from the airport
he doesnt look entirely convinced
is it two hundred dollars worth of surprise
no its more of a fifty dollar surprise
i can lend you a bicycle
besides the car is booked
i use it to carry equipment for a band
phil pulls some cash out of his pocket and sorts through it
well heres two hundred dollars to unbook it
let em carry their own trombones
phil passes the money over
larry starts to count it
you dont need to count it
you could trust me
larry doesnt pause counting
lets see ive never met you in my life you shout through my mail slot you want to hire my hearse as a joke and
youre twenty dollars short
why should i trust you
that last twenty is for gas
anyway i havent even seen the car yet
im the one whos operating on trust
its a hearse
what else do you need to know
the garage doors swing open and a hearse drives out into the sun
it is bright yellow and covered in painted flowers
one of the side windows is broken and a headlight hangs out
phils jaw drops open
larry gets out of the driving seat and pats the roof proudly
bernice is a cadillac superior royale tiara limousine funeral coach
weve got a seven gallon v engine offering three hundred and forty bhp at four thousand six hundred revolutions per minute
youre looking at a twenty one feet beauty with a one hundred and fifty six inch wheelbase containing a four barrel rochester quadrajet carburetor with turbo hydramatic transmission
bernice weighs over six thousand pounds
there is a very long silence
yes its yellow
bernice comes in yellow
its supposed to be black
but theyre all black
that might be my point
so how is a yellow hearse covered with flowers less of a surprise than a black hearse
i paid you two hundred dollars for a black hearse
patiently no you paid me a hundred and eighty dollars for a hearse and a hearse is what youve got
if you take a long hard look at bernice youll see that shes one of a kind
shes big shes fast shes comfortable and shes beautiful
but shes not black
they stare at each other for a moment
then phil sighs deeply
where are the keys
i gotta go
larry looks from phil to bernice and back again
she doesnt go anywhere without me
phil thinks this over
well lets boogie
larry runs across and closes the doors on a pile of amps and band equipment that now sits in the garage
phil puts the guitar in the back seat and they get into the car
larry pulls a screwdriver out of the glove compartment and jigs it about in the ignition until the engine catches
then he turns the keys and pull up and down to undo the steering lock
phil watches curiously
someone stole her last summer
well ive paid top dollar so its nice to see im getting the best
how did you hear of bernice and me
you are famous throughout the greater los angeles area
larry looks pleased
but you are the only guy with a hearse
dont go getting carried away
one backfire and bernice is ready
the hearse weaves erratically across the road and then disappears in a cloud of exhaust smoke
barbara sits at a table in her shabby kitchen reading the will
she lights a cigarette and sits back in her chair
the hearse drives under a huge sign which reads welcome to los angeles airport and peels off the main road past some offices and cargo stores
bernice drives into a giant hangar and pulls up outside a dark and shuttered office
phil glances out of the window
larry parks and phil looks at his watch
whats the matter
what flight are they on
well wait here
well what time is the flight due
why do you ask so many damn questions
i dont know
there is silence
then shouldnt we be at arrivals
look will you please shut up asking me stuff
he looks out of the window and then back at phil who now has his eyes closed
so how long are we going to wait
phil doesnt answer for a moment
just as larry opens his mouth to ask again phil speaks
larry looks at phil with astonishment
what do you mean morning
well make the pick up in the morning
larry tries to start the car
phil leans over and plucks the screwdriver from his hand
he reclines his seat and closes his eyes
you wait till morning
im going home
larry opens the door and gets out of the car
he slams the door shut behind him and stomps off into the gloom
phil doesnt move
the drivers door opens and larry gets back into the car
im only back because i dont trust you with bernice
i dont even know you and if you think im going to leave my car with you and just walk away then youve got another thought on the way
he stares at phil who hasnt moved an inch eyes still closed unlit cigar hanging out of the corner of his mouth feet up on the dash
im staying right here
where i can keep an eye on things
there is still no response from phil
after a moment larry settles back in his seat and closes his eyes
the hearse disappears into the gloom as the light fades and night falls
a door swings open and barbara appears
she is looking quite stunning with a tight black suit doing equal justice to her womanly curves and her duties as a mourner
she strides down the sidewalk and as a group of schoolchildren appears around the corner barbara scatters left and right
then she cuts across the road and a delivery van skids to a halt inches away horn blaring
the driver leans out of the window furious
barbara stops and whips round her hair cascading across her shoulders her blue eyes flashing
the man simply stares at her enchanted by her beauty
he continues to stare and is only shaken back to his senses by a burst of abuse from further back in the road
should be careful
why thank you
stanley is standing at the airport airlines check in desk facing the check in clerk
the clerk checks her paperwork
youve just arrived from new orleans mister parsons
and youre flying directly back to new orleans
on the same plane
that is correct
the clerk awaits an explanation but none is forthcoming
she raises an eyebrow
well enjoy your stay at los angeles airport mister parsons
stanley turns to go but then pauses
ive come to pick up my sons body
the line behind him falls quiet and the officious clerk wobbles slightly
stanley raises his voice
my son died out here you see
so ive come to bring him home
everyone looks at stanley
stanley looks at the clerk
im wondering if thats enough information for you
see to it that you get every assistance on your journey sir
there is a line leading to the information desk but barbara ignores it
she walks up to a female teller who is serving another customer and cuts in
id like to see the manager please
wait your turn
barbaras eyes immediately water and her lower lip trembles
its just that the man i loved died yesterday
i was forgetting my manners
she dabs at her eyes with a lace handkerchief
the customer looks embarrassed
barbara fixes the teller with a no nonsense look
the teller responds with a similar look
a man unlocks the shutters with a clatter and goes inside
the sound wakes phil who glances around and stretches before getting out of the car
phil walks over to the door and walks inside the mortuary
the clerk busies himself opening up
phil wanders around and knocks into a coffin
the lid bangs closed and the sound echoes around the hangar
can i help you
im here to pick up a
the clerk looks phil over
hes dressed in denim with scuffed harley davidson cowboy boots topped off with a cut down denim jacket with sin city stitched into the back
no youre not
yes i am
youre here to pick up a casket
phil looks irritated
what flight number
it was due out on the next flight to new orleans but im driving it now
the stiff doesnt like to fly
the clerk stares at him
youre one of those funny guys right
yeah but its my day off
mine or the
phil moves to the desk
the clerk turns and shouts over his shoulder
barney bring up parsons
the bank manager is staring at the piece of paper
i simply cant give you any money based on this piece of paper
barbara is totally calm
its not a piece of paper
its a promise from gram to leave me all his money
well im sorry but its highly likely that the estate will go to probate and be divided up accordingly subject to a valid will existing
she just looks at him
he tries again
mister parsons was a customer of ours
we cant just pass his money across to someone who says theyre in the will
barbara realizing that shes getting nowhere starts to cry
you dont seem to understand
these are his wishes
barbara is now sobbing and the bank manager is becoming increasing uncomfortable
he gives her his handkerchief
understand miss mansfield
really i do
please tell me how im supposed to get my money
well i imagine that you first need to prove that mister parsons is actually dead
are you saying that im lying
no absolutely not
but getting a copy of the death certificate would probably be a good first step
stanley takes a swig from a hip flask and looks out of the window
a very overweight red faced man squeezes into the next seat
he bangs stanley with his knee as he sits but stanley doesnt move
he peers at stanley and shuffles in his seat but there is still no reaction
next a deep sigh is forced out between his fat wet lips he is plainly keen to start a conversation
stanley keeps looking out of the window
he is watching the cargo being loaded
paw on the space dontcha think
stanley turns slowly
the fat man smiles and extends a chubby hand which stanley shakes awkwardly and reluctantly
p j gambrell at yer assistance
jes saying paw on the space in dese buckets
stanley is obviously having problems fully understanding what is being said
after a moment stanley parsons
gowna be a trip
besta know yer otherwise gowna be a slow one
i suppose so
the clerk scribbles on a form
theyll be along
with this being a rush job they said youd understand
he passes a folded banknote across
the clerk pockets it without a change of expression
well youd better tell them that weve got rules
the men stare at each other
then phil pulls another note out of his pocket and passes that over
again the clerk pockets it
and this is the exception which proves that particular rule
then although you dont need to tell them that
phil smiles broadly at him
the clerk turns and selects a casket from a gurney behind the counter
is your deceased
phil is wheeling a casket on a gurney down the middle of the hangar
he can see larry peering through the window at him
he can also see a uniformed policeman approaching larry from the other side of the street
as he speeds up to try and reach larry first the clerk calls out from his desk
good luck with her
phil closes his eyes and slows to a halt
larry is jumping up and down nervously outside the window
the policeman appears at his shoulder
excuse me sir
is that your hearse
larry turns slowly
the cop points at bernice
larry has started to sweat profusely
the cop looks at him carefully
are you okay sir
he leans against the window for support
stanley is looking out of the planes window but the fat man is now locked on
he gestures around him
jes sayin bout the space
another thoughtful pause from stanley
he glances out at the cargo loaders
space ma game kinda
why have one room
when you can have two
he leans forward to watch a loader wheeling a casket towards the back of the plane
whats your bidness
stanley watches the coffin and doesnt answer
a tear rolls down his face
the fat man pulls some candy out of his pocket and takes a bite
phil and the clerk peer into the open casket
thats a she
and yours is supposed to be male
the clerk walks back to the counter and peers at his paperwork
whaddya mean gone
we got the wrong box
your box is being loaded
so how do i get my box back
the clerk raises an eyebrow
phil understands immediately
youre a damn thief
thats very hurtful
phil reluctantly hands another note over and the clerk speaks into a radio
larry is standing by the hearse
the cop is reading his license
so whatcha doin here
stanley has his eyes closed
the fat man eats
suddenly stanleys eyes snap open and he peers out of the window
a motorized cart chugs into view with the casket covered in a blanket on the back
it is driving away from the plane
what the hell
he stands up and turns to the fat man
i need to get off the plane
the fat man reluctantly struggles to his feet and squeezes out into the aisle
only jes got settled
phil glances nervously out to where larry is being interrogated by the cop
the clerk is reading a paper
can you speed things up
whats the hurry
phil is distracted watching the cop and larry out of the window
id like to get to the joshua tree while its still light
the clerk looks up
i thought you were taking him to new orleans
when you came in you said you were driving the casket out to new orleans
but just now you said you were headed for the joshua tree
phil is under pressure
joshua tree yeah
a buzzer sounds
no one moves
joshua tree louisiana
just outside the city
never heard of that
just another local community struggling to get by
the buzzer goes again and phil attempts to change the subject
use your phone
after a moment the clerk nods towards the phone on the desk before turning and disappearing into the rear of the mortuary
phil wipes some sweat from his forehead picks up the phone and dials
susie is packing
the phone rings and she hesitates for a moment
then she continues loading her case leaving the phone unanswered
stanley tries to ask a question at the check in desk but gives up and walks toward an exit
the clerk returns with a casket on a gurney and phil replaces the receiver as the clerk flips open the top of the casket and peers inside
into casket hello there
we was looking for you
he wheels the casket over and phil has a quick look inside
need you to sign for it again
phil signs the papers
looks like its your lucky day after all
im a real lucky guy
phil again glances out of the window
the cop is wandering around the hearse
larry trails behind him disconsolately
i dont like the look of you
wherever theres a hippie theres a crime even if it hasnt happened yet
thats what i always say
he prods at the broken light with his baton
so whatcha doing here
were meeting someone off a flight
youre meeting someone off a flight
in a hearse
which parts the surprise the fact that youre in a bright yellow hearse the fact that youre dressed like something out of a horror film or the fact that youre
half a mile from the terminal and theyre gonna have to walk across two runways to reach you
larry is looking increasingly desperate
the first part
the cop nods and repeats it to himself
the first part
they stare at each other
okay now why dont you tell me what the hells going on
they stare at each other
the cop shifts position and purses his lips
larry stares at the ground looking for some kind of inspiration
just when the silence moves beyond uncomfortable the door of the mortuary opens and phil clatters out with the casket
well i dont care if it is first thing in the morning but i sure need a coffee
i tell you ive never seen so many darned bits of paper to sign
its paperwork which is slowing this great country down
were drowning in triplicate
hes busying himself at the back of the hearse and appears to notice the cop for the first time
good morning officer
the cop peers at him suspiciously
i was just saying how people with work to do people like yourself officer are just getting engulfed by paper
grab the end will you
doesnt that just drive you plain crazy
the cop hesitates and then takes the end of the casket and helps load it into the hearse
i guess it does
phil gestures at larry to get into the car which he does
one casket six sheets to sign
that cant be right
does that sound right to you
he closes the back doors and gets into the passenger seat
and the very last thing i want to do is to hold you up further with my chatter
thank you for your help officer
you have a good day now
it looks like theyve got away with it
but just a moment boys
phil smiles up at him
your sidekick here has just finished telling me that youre gonna pick someone up from the terminal
a surprise he said
and here you are loading a coffin into your vehicle
phil doesnt miss a beat
and there you have it officer
you see the gentleman were meeting from the plane doesnt yet know about the sad passing of his
and youre gonna meet him off his flight with her coffin
he raises an eyebrow
thats a real nice touch
were doing it this way for the avoidance of doubt
he gestures at larry to start the car
larry pulls out the screwdriver and starts to jig it about in the ignition
the cop watches
as the engine refuses to catch larry starts to panic
ignitions a bit temperamental
have to use a screwdriver
i see that
the car starts
thanks for everything officer
wed best be off
he looks meaningfully at the cop who grudgingly moves back
as they move off stanley hurries round the corner with his overnight bag in his hand
inside the car phil bangs on the dashboard in joy and exultation
we did it
what did we do
phil changes the subject
what was all that babbling about earlier
i didnt babble
have a problem with authority
what the hell does that mean
i dont like them and i dont know what to say to them
they make me feel uneasy
well of course they make you feel uneasy
theyre supposed to make you feel uneasy
phil shakes his head and glances back at the cop and larry crashes the car straight into the hangar wall
we pull back to reveal the enormous opening that larry has missed
they both sit there staring out of the windshield at the wall
you hit the wall
i clipped it
i clipped the wall
shouts theres a gap fifty yards wide
you just had to aim for the gap
how could you miss the gap
babbles i was distracted
were supposed to be picking someone up and you arrive with a coffin and id only just woken up and
the cop peers in at the window and gestures at phil to wind it down
as he does the glass falls out
i guess they make these hearses wider than they need to
the cop ignores him and concentrates on larry
are you on drugs boy
larry swallows hard
uh not at this time no sir
not at this time
okay well lets see
you just missed a gap of fifty yards and hit a wall in broad daylight
why was that
larry licks his lips
phil wills him to speak
larry looks like hes trying to form words but nothing emerges
now im gonna
the radio in his car crackles into life
we and he are too far away to hear what is said
he is torn for a moment but then wait
he walks back to his car
phil shakes his head
so its all my fault
you just drove into a wall
of course its your fault
they both stare out of the window at the cop who is talking animatedly into his radio
then the flashing lights and siren go on
here it comes
the police car drives up to and then past the hearse before disappearing out of the hanger at speed
phil and larry look at each other
well what are we doing now
he said to wait
phil just stares at him
after a moment larry reverses bernice and then drives the battered car through the gap and out of the hangar
phil slumps back in his seat
nice going hippie
went right through the gap that time
larry says nothing
phil leans back in his seat
well we got it
larry slams the brakes on and the huge car skids to a halt in a cloud of dust
phil is flung forward in his seat
what are you talking about
he looks nervously out of the back window
cmon we gotta keep moving
get out and take your friend with you
look i can see youre a bit
sensitive about this whole
shouts stop saying that
i cant get out
look its not right to throw me out onto the street with a coffin
larry slips the car into gear and it moves forward
larry makes a u turn
what the hell are you doing
im driving back to the mortuary
you cant do that
nearly at the turn now
phil opens the car door with a mind to jump out but one look at the fast moving road changes his mind
he glowers at larry and shuts the door
the hearse skids round the corner larry slams on the brakes and the car slides to a halt outside the mortuary
larry gestures towards the back of the car
whos the stiff
the clerk is standing at the counter staring at stanley
the clerk looks worried
long blond hair blue eyes mid twenties
was he in a berkeley
whats a berkeley
a luxury casket of solid mahogany finished with a split hinged lid eight brass plated casket handles and an engraved inscription plate
barbara is sitting in a cubicle opposite a middle aged woman in a suit
her allure appears lost on the official who gives the dress a disapproving look
and hes a
she says musician with great distaste
he was a musician
the woman flicks through some papers on her desk
barbara watches her
eventually im afraid we have no official notification of death
with a flourish barbara places a copy of the la times on the table
the headline is country rock pioneer dead in large black print
the official glances at it and gives a thin smile
at this current time the greater los angeles registrar of births marriages and deaths does not regard the local newspaper as an official recorder of record
larry is staring at phil
can we please talk about this later
this is not a great place to be right now
larry moves to get out of the car
phil grabs his arm
oh just a minute
now i understand
you think theres a body back there
he starts to laugh
you think theres a body in the coffin
larry watches him laugh
phil catches the look and stops laughing
i can fully understand why youd think that
i mean it is a coffin and all
but would i would i really steal a real live dead body
stanley and the clerk are staring at each other
you just gave the body away
well its not like this is a bank
people round here dont generally take dead bodies theyre not entitled to
why did you give it to him
well he signed for it
who signed for it
the clerk peers at his paperwork
when he eventually speaks it is wearily
and where do i find this john nobody
the clerks attention switches to a point just above stanleys shoulder
he points out through the window to where the hearse is parked over a hundred yards away
larry is staring at phil
absolutely completely totally
it looked pretty heavy for an empty casket
they are made of finest
thats very heavy wood
mahogany or oak but not
look im not going to argue with you now
poplar is very well suited to the making of coffins
larry stares hard at phil
we see the door of the mortuary open over larrys shoulder and stanley and the clerk emerge
so why have we got an empty coffin in the back of the car
phil glances at the approaching stanley
selling them on to a company in palm springs
lots of stiffs lots of money
and then of course its very environmentally sound
look under the circumstances perhaps we should renegotiate the financial arrangement between us
larry still stares at phil
stanley is almost at the car
that babys worth two grand
stanley is getting ever closer
phil can see him in his wing mirror
larry releases the safety brake and the giant car roars away leaving stanley standing in a cloud of dust
barbara picks up the newspaper and rips it into pieces which she scatters onto the desk
she walks towards the door
dont forget now
barbara keeps walking
notification of death
barbara is gone the door slamming behind her
phil is still pitching
they are driving alongside the airport runway
so then bobby transfers em into hardboard boxes just prior to the cremation and i drive the caskets over to a guy i know in palm springs who resells them
well im not sure the one careful owner thing works with coffins
the whole thing is completely immoral
i saw how outraged you were back there when i mentioned money
just think of it as recycling
look i really need to get home
larry is sweating
well while i acknowledge the power of your argument we have to be somewhere else
so just settle back and enjoy the ride
larry slows the car down
larry pulls the car onto a gas station forecourt
an attendant is filling bernice
he looks phil over
you an undertaker
aint yer surposed to be in black
were special rock n roll undertakers
larry is sitting on the toilet seat still fully dressed but bent double with cramps
then phil bangs on the door and calls from outside
cmon hippie lets roll
larry turns to look at his reflection in the grimy mirror
he is shaking
the tank is full and the attendant screws the cap back on
phil reaches into the back and pulls out his jerry can
he passes it to the guy
this car runs on regular
phil raises an eyebrow glances across at the casket and winks
who says its for the car
the man gapes at him
larry walks over to the car and phil gets into the passenger seat
he passes some money to the attendant and takes the can
aint fer the car
larry jiggles the screwdriver slips bernice into gear and theyre gone
the attendant watches them go
larry is driving phil is looking out of the window
they are still in a built up area with cars around them
we could go back
why would we want to do that
i wasnt expecting a long trip
i havent packed any spare clothes
we could pick up some supplies and drive out tomorrow
you want to go home to pick up fresh clothes
phil stares at him
and then drive back out tomorrow
we could do that
just drive the car okay
we could just
barbara is standing in her sitting room the phone to her ear
you might need to repeat that
her mouth drops open and she sinks down onto her couch
what the hell do you mean stolen
who steals a body
phil is smoking
larry is driving his fingers tapping nervously on the wheel
he looks distracted and speaks to break the silence
i still dont fully understand what you do
well i do everything
this little number is for drinking money
by trade im a road manager
oh one of those
like a well paid gopher
no not like a well paid gopher
im responsible for movement maintenance and management
im a confidante and a companion a partner and a patron an ally agent and ambassador
im like an executive nanny
not a gopher
larry backs down with hint of sarcasm an executive nanny not a gopher
thanks for clearing that up
bernice cruises along the freeway then takes an exit for joshua tree
stanley and the clerk are standing just inside the hangar door
so where are the cops
the clerk pulls the money out of his top pocket and looks at it
he shrugs his shoulders
i called them
theres supposed to be a funeral in new orleans
i need to find my boy
clerk points into the distance
the man said hes going to joshua tree louisiana
susie is moving her suitcases into the sitting room when there is a banging on the front door
susie opens the door and barbara is standing outside
wheres the son of a bitch
the son of a bitch isnt here
well hes stolen gram
susie looks bemused
barbara lights a cigarette
they had some kind of weird pact
i think phils taken gram out to the desert
some kind of voodoo thing with hot wax and dolls to stick pins in
dont be ridiculous
barbara glances down at the packed bags and smiles
now that is a wise move if you ask me
i didnt ask you
the hearse is parked by the side of the road near a rickety stall where an old lady sits selling melons
larry sits inside and phil walks to a phone by the side of the road
the girls are still arguing
youll learn about phil kaufman
if you stick around long enough
and you know him
i know hes a brainless interfering asshole yes
i dont need to listen to this garbage
the phone starts to ring
susie instinctively moves towards it then stops
barbara watches carefully
thats him isnt it
generally its best to answer the phone to discover whos calling
she still makes no move to answer it
she walks across the room and picks up the phone
phil is holding the phone
hello baby its the love machine
how are ya
barbara smiles unpleasantly
i know what youre up to you thieving bastard
i know where youre going and i know about your sick revolting plans and im coming after you
and when i catch you
phil looks surprised
how nice to hear from you again
and so soon
suddenly the door of the hearse flies open and larry runs out
phil holds the phone away from his ear as barbaras shouting can be heard coming out of the receiver
he watches as larry just makes it to a cactus and is violently sick
he glances across to where the old melon woman watches expressionless from her stall
after a moment larry wipes himself down and walks back to the car
sorry barb gotta go
he goes to replace the receiver and then pops in a last comment
its been real though
he puts the phone down cutting off barbaras squawk and watches larry get into the hearse
barbara slams the phone down
then she picks up the receiver again and smashes it onto the table
she walks to the door brushing past susie
then she stops
do you want to see who phil kaufman really is
do you want to see what hes capable of
barbara shows susie the door
or maybe you already know im right
susie hesitantly dismisses the challenge
you dont know shit about him
well why dont we find out
barbara turns and walks out
susie looks at her packed bags then follows
phil gets into the hearse looks back at the coffin and sniffs
he looks down at the air conditioning and turns it up full
larry starts the engine and the car stalls
so whats that about
phil shakes his head
youve hardly left the car since we met
how can you have sunstroke
phil doesnt look convinced
youre a winner thats what you are
eventually the engine catches
phil immediately gestures at a small road that heads off into the desert
turn off here
this isnt the way to palm springs
phil winks at him
it is if youre a coffin smuggler
the old woman watches them go
we stay on the old woman and her melon stall as the light rapidly changes cars and pedestrians whizz by and an hour passes in moments
as we slow to normal speed a car drives past stops and reverses back to park by the stall
stanley gets out of the avis budget hire car
he points at a melon
ill take that one please
i was wondering
have you seen a hearse pass this way in the last couple of hours
whats it look like
the question throws stanley
its a big car
a big yellow car
two guys inside
was one of em sick in them bushes
i dont know
the old woman nods
i seen it
larry drives and talks phil looks tense
see the yin is the negative the darkside
and the yang represents positive good
if you like the first is earth and the second heaven
larry still talks
phil now looks bored
the yin yang symbol is really evocative about the whole concept
as you travel around the circle white or black will increase until the opposite color is almost gone
but never totally gone right
and this cycle then repeats for the opposite color
larry still talks glancing across to phil to make his point every now and then
phil is tossing a cigarette into the air and trying to catch it between his teeth
what seems like yin is often supported by yang and vice versa
let me give you an example to truly know good you must first know evil and without good as a comparison nothing can be evil
so by allowing yin to flourish you welcome yan
by letting go of yin you are waiting for its return
another example is
there is a crash and the car slams to a halt
larry is thrown forward but manages to grab the wheel
phil is not so lucky and catapults into the dashboard before being thrown back into his seat the crumpled cigarette still gripped between his teeth
bernice has driven into a road sign set into a concrete pillar
in fact the sign that bernice has driven into is the only thing anywhere near the road for miles in any direction
phil is dazed
he checks his forehead which is bleeding
then he gazes out at the desolate road and the solitary buckled sign
it would be really nice if we could get through a couple of hours without crashing the car
i was distracted
phil looks out of the window at the vast expanse of nothing but desert
of course you were
there is a faint noise
larry hears it first and then phil and then as they strain to identify it they see a tiny dot on the road ahead of them which grows and grows
as they watch it and they peer hard into the wind to identify it and
its a motorcycle cop
i dont believe it
middle of nowhere and
quick stand in front of the car
they jump out of the car and shuffle sideways until they are standing in front of the actual point of collision
pretend were having a conversation
the buckled sign hangs dangerously above them as they both grin at the approaching policeman in a friendly manner
i dont know what about
ever since i met you youve talked
yabba yabba yabba every waking minute
religion your supersonic supercharged car the darkside
now you need to talk and you cant think of anything to say
the cop slows down but drives past
phil waves at him
whatever your damn fool religion is called i think it works
its more a philosophy than a religion
the cop does a u turn and motors towards them
oh well done
he shoots a vicious look at larry
the cop parks his bike and removes his helmet
as he opens his mouth to speak a headlight falls off the car and rolls off the road
they all watch it go
hows it going today
the sign gives an ominous creak
larry takes a sideways step out of danger
oh its going fine thank you
how are things with you
stopped to take a look at
he waves his arm at the desert
the fine view you folks have got around here
the cop takes his sunglasses off and takes a look around as if its the first time hes seen it
well it is mighty nice around these parts
if you like desert
they all look appreciatively at the desert and the cop glances down at the keys in larrys hand
to larry and how are things with you today sir
larry looks flustered
ooooh im well
really well actually
the cop doesnt respond just keeps looking at larry with a pleasant half smile on his face
the reason i ask is that you appear to have driven into one of our road signs
larry turns and appears to see the huge buckled pole for the first time
im surprised that you hadnt noticed earlier as it does appear to be impeding your forward progress
phil starts to laugh
thats a great line
the cop turns to phil
he is still smiling
a long pause
then i wonder if you gentlemen can help me
im looking for some fellows who stole a body back there at the airport
larry wobbles with shock
stole a body
rather like the one in the back of your car
thats an empty coffin officer
the cop ignores him
phil lights his cigar
i know it sounds strange
but these guys there are two of them they stole a body loaded it into the back of an old yellow hearse painted with flowers and theyre supposed to be
driving out this way
larry thinks hard
he looks to phil for support
phil raises an eyebrow
i think hes onto us larry
hes just having a little fun at our expense
the cop is no longer smiling
in the car please
phil opens the door and empty beer bottles cascade out into the road
they get into the car and the cop cuffs them together through the steering wheel and takes the car keys
then he walks back over to his bike and starts to talk into the radio
phil closes his eyes and shakes his head
he said a body
he said we stole a body
phil opens his eyes
he meant a coffin
he didnt say coffin
he said body
tell me we havent stolen a real person
look the place that i get the coffins from probably havent filed a report yet
itll all be sorted out within the hour
oh im just overflowing with trust for you man
i feel this overwhelming feeling of
trust every time i look at you
he shakes his head
im gonna check inside that box just as soon as were out of here
they both stare out of the window
phil bangs the cuffs against the wheel
they sit glowering out of different windows at different bits of desert
the motorcycle cop can be heard talking into his radio
what are we going to do
bitterly were going to be arrested thats what were going to do
then well go to court and then well go to jail and well do that for a while
larry mulls this over
what about if i could slip out of these cuffs
phil treats the theoretical question with indifference
yeah that would be great
then we could suspend you from a bridge in a straitjacket and set the rope on fire
i really can slip these cuffs
he has phils attention now
larry pops his middle finger out of its socket squeezes his hand and slides it out of the handcuff
he hands the other cuff to phil who stares at him in astonishment
do you think we should go
yes i think we should go
larry starts the car
he throws it into reverse and the bumper slowly disengages from the metal signpost
suddenly the car tears loose and flies backwards smashing into the cops motorcycle leaving him holding the radio and its trailing wire
larry slams on the brakes
he rolls down his window and addresses the cop who is staring with horror at his ruined motorcycle
well be moving on now that your sign no longer appears to be impeding our forward progress
bernice accelerates away but slowly starts to turn in a wide ark and circles the smashed bike
the cop chases them
phil screams at larry
what the hell are you doing
the steering lock is on
turn it off
i cant hes got the keys
phil turns to watch the chasing policeman
so weve escaped but we can only drive in a circle
they do another circuit
the exhausted cop stops breathing heavily and then watches in astonishment as the hearse turns and heads back towards him
phil and larry stare at the policeman out of the window as the car sweeps past
the cop gets his gun out of his holster and phil reaches into the glove box and pulls out the screwdriver
he leans across larry jams it into the wheel column and snaps the steering lock in two
the hearses direction immediately changes
can we please go
the hearse roars away and the cop watches it go
barbara drives and susie sits in the passenger seat
it doesnt look as if theyve spoken for hours
if you hate phil so much why are you chasing him across california
hes got gram and i need him
well thats really touching
youve got to come to terms with the fact that hes dead
barbara shoots her a withering look
i know hes dead honey
but he hasnt been officially identified and theres no certificate of death
i dont understand
lets just say im overly sentimental okay
this is all about money isnt it
why do you think you deserve anything
i was a great support to gram before kaufman came along and spoiled the party
phils not responsible for your problems with gram
what do you know
i know that he can be a pain in the ass but when it came to gram phil only ever did the right thing
in his whole life phil kaufman didnt do anything because it was the right thing to do
you can bet the ranch that wherever he is hes having some fun
maybe thats what i like about him
sure it is honey
thats why your bags were packed
have you any idea what its like to really love someone
you might exclusively love phil kaufman but unfortunately so does he
youre just handy to have around
i dont have to listen to this
susie leans over grabs the safety brake and pulls it up hard
the car swerves and skids to a stop
okay you vindictive bitch
im going with you to joshua tree because my life seems to have been turned upside down and i want to know why
but you dont know me and i wont let you judge me
do it again and ill smash that pretty little face of yours off the fucking road
barbara dismisses her anger with a tight little smile
the truth can hurt cant it
phil finishes his beer rubs his eyes and slumps back in his seat
he looks terrible but not as bad as larry who is pasty and sweating
well thats it
theyre going to lock me up and throw away the key
why would they do that
you saw what happened
i drove over that cops bike
thats destruction of police property or something
you worry too much
not til i met you
phil finishes his beer and peers at the empty bottle
then something catches his eye and he leans forward in his seat
jesus what the hell is that
a large plaster dinosaur appears ahead
its a dinosaur
whats it doing
as they get nearer they can see that the huge model is carrying a sign
reads the polyonax place
aside to phil a polyonax is probably some kind of dinosaur
phil shoots him a look
reads dinoburgers reptile steaks and primeval soup
titanosaurion portions prehistoric pricing
pull over lets
the copsll be after us and we should just get on to palm springs and do the thing and then i can get home and you can
do whatever it is you do
lets do that
we need to stop
im starting to get hungry
im not nice hungry
you surprise me
i vote we keep going
what gave you the impression this was a democracy
the hearse pulls up around the back of the building and parks in a place that is hidden from the road
phil gets out and stretches
he is joined by larry and they both peer round the side of the building to check that they have not been observed
then they walk towards the entrance
a police car with siren blaring and lights flashing speeds past on the road
we are with a short order cook
he expertly flips a burger from a hotplate and adds it to a plate overflowing with bacon sausage and fries
he slips this plate onto a tray on which there is a second plate containing two pieces of plain bread and some lettuce
he dings a bell and a waiter enters and picks up the tray
we move with the tray as he carries it from the kitchen and into the dining area
he stops at the bar to load three foaming glasses of beer and a glass of water onto the tray and delivers it to phil and larry who are sitting
in a window booth
larry has his head resting on the table
he lifts it as soon as the food arrives
you frighten him
i do not
everyone else he announces the food when he brings it
diplodocus this and allosaurus that
us he just slaps it down and runs for cover
they both look at larrys bread and lettuce
its probably the rabbit food
look im a vegetarian
i have a problem with dead flesh
really i do
that stuffll mess you right up every time
phil picks up the first beer and downs it in one go
stanley is driving along the road
he puts his hand in his pocket takes out his hip flask pops the lid and goes to take a drink
then he notices the dinosaur
phil pushes his full plate away and finishes off the third beer
he gets up
larry notices he hasnt eaten anything
i thought you were hungry
phil ignores him
gotta make a call
he glances around and then walks over to the bar
hey man wheres the phone
he jerks his head by way of direction
phil wanders off just as the door opens and stanley walks in
do you have a telephone i might use
in a minute i do
in a minute
phones for customers
stanley looks confused
then he understands
id better order then
stanley picks up a menu
phil dials a number on the phone
the sitting room is empty
the phone rings
when it becomes clear that no one is going to answer phil replaces the receiver and walks back into the diner
he pushes past stanley as he goes to the bar
phil joins larry and puts a bag of beers on the table
speak to her
none of your damn business
so you didnt
maybe shes out
shopping or something
phil pours the rest of his beer down his throat before signaling the barman to serve him another
yeah thatll be it
he raises an eyebrow at larry
behind him we see stanley walk in and take a seat at the bar
to barman beer
the barman gives stanley his beer
would you put a scotch in there please
he pours the spirit in
stanley rubs the top of his head
yeah a real bad day
my boy died out here the other day and some punks have stolen his body
stanley reaches for his pocket
the barman puts his hand up to refuse the money
thats worth a shot on the house
the barman tips a little more scotch into the beer
stanley takes a drink
phil slips some money on the bar and stands up
to larry we gotta go
larry is listening to the conversation
havent finished my drink
to stanley why would someone steal a body
phil picks up the glass of water and drinks it down
he turns and walks to the door
well maybe they were souvenir hunters or something
my boys kinda famous
who is he
phil is back
the barman looks surprised
phil reaches across and grabs the back of larrys jacket
both the barman and stanley look round but larrys stool is now empty spinning
he and phil are already at the door
phil propels larry outside
is gram parsons dead
better get going
he said someone took gram parsons body
yeah he was a real blabbermouth
in fact i thought he was never gonna stop talking
anyway although thats real interesting weve gotta keep to the schedule
there is no schedule
well i think we should just make our delivery as soon as possible dont you
get our package to palm springs
larry looks horrified
weve stolen that mans son
im appalled that you could even think wed do such a thing
they move round the back of the polyonax place where bernice is hidden behind an outhouse
i dont know what you take me for
i want to see in that box
larry walks round to the back of the car
weve really got to go
larry swings open the back window and pulls at the casket
phil glances at his watch
well if youre satisfied lets go
i said its heavy
well it is made of wood
wood is heavy
yeah i remember
larry slides the top of the casket off and looks inside
he drops the lid and looks at phil horrified
phil walks over and looks inside
gosh they must have given us a full one
well have to sort that all out when we get to palm springs and
larry is staring at him with horror
oh my god
you stole gram parsons
phil gives up
well technically we stole gram parsons
i stole a coffin i didnt know there was a body in it
id save that line for court
as the enormity of the news starts to sink in larry hops up and down in panic
phil watches him
what are you doing now
larry is losing control
i dont know
what am i doing
what am i doing
why am i here
why am i with you
i thought it was bad enough when i ran over the cops bike but now im a fucking body snatcher
well when youve quite finished we should go
larry goggles at him
his voice takes on a level of hysteria
i tell you what im going to do
im going inside and im going to give that man his son back
im going to do the right thing im going to follow my conscience im going to
larry walks towards the bar then quick walks then runs
phil tackles him around the legs and they both fall
larrys head hits the ground hard and he lies there unconscious
phil picks him up slings him into the passenger seat and slides behind the wheel
the hearse moves off
stanley takes another drink and glances out of the window just as the bright yellow hearse drives past
he stands up and walks to the window
son of a bitch
the hearse picks up speed and powers down the highway out into the desert
susie seethes and barbara smokes
youre not a very nice person are you
no i suppose not
does it matter
susie looks surprised
it might get you further
i do okay
listen i was an orphan at fourteen and a waitress at fifteen
i do what i do because it puts food on my table and because if i dont look after myself no one else will
so what do you want from us
i dont want anything from you
it would be a bonus to see kaufman crash and burn but i dont need to be there when it happens
why do you hate phil so much
barbara lights another cigarette
gram was the first good guy i ever hooked up with
he wasnt perfect but it worked between us
we just seemed to fit together
but gram was already wild and i made him wilder
kaufman watched over him like a hawk and when he felt things were getting out of control he turned gram against me
i lost the only decent thing in my life
surely phil was just looking after gram
gram was an adult
he didnt need a nursemaid
except that now hes dead
without my help and while kaufman was babysitting
silence for a moment
i dont like you much barbara
i just want whats mine and then im gone
gone real fast
the hearse powers through along the desert highway
they pass a sign which reads if youre looking for the joshua tree national monument youre getting close
if youre not youre getting lost
phil is getting very tired his vision is blurring and he shakes his head to wake himself up
he glances across and sees that larry is awake and staring at him
welcome back hippie
so why dya do it
have a guess
there is a moments silence
well i gave my word
this is what gram wanted
what cruise around the desert until he starts to smell
were you both bombed
phil looks offended
do you have friends
of course i have friends
well what would you do for them
anything within reason
phil stares out of the window
thats what i hate about people like you
everythings within reason
there are always boundaries provisos
you only operate with a safety net
larry is confused
tell me something if it was the other way round would gram be sitting here driving your bones out into the desert
phil says nothing
youve missed the point
see it doesnt matter what he would do or what you and your tie dyed friends think is the correct way to behave
to me it only matters what i do
where you have boundaries and limits and thresholds i only have right and wrong
if i make a promise i keep it thats right
if i break that promise thats wrong
phil rubs his eyes tired
suddenly larry smashes phil across the head with a bottle of jack daniels
phil slumps back in the seat and larry dropping the bloodied weapon reaches across to grab the wheel and slow the hearse
bernice fishtails across the road as larry struggles to retain control
it eventually slides to a halt
larry gets out and runs round to the drivers door
larry stares down at phil
he slides phil across the seat and slips behind the wheel
he shouts at the unconscious phil
you made me do it you bastard
ive never hit anyone in my life but you pushed and you pushed and
you gave me no choice
larry prods phil to ensure hes unresponsive
the hearse executes a wide u turn before gently rejoining the highway and heading back towards town
a moment after completing the turn the one remaining headlight stutters and goes out
bernice pulls off the road
he flicks the headlight switch but to no avail
then in the distance he sees a car approaching
stanley can be glimpsed in the driving seat as the car flashes past
bernice rejoins the road and drives slowly off into the darkness after stanley
phil is motionless and larry peers out into the darkness as the car limps on lit only from the light of the moon
larry sees a glow in the distance ahead and drives towards a neon sign welcome to the joshua tree inn
he stops by the entrance to the inn and stares at stanleys car parked in the bay outside room
he glances across at phil turns the car around and drives in
bernice glides to a stop in the bay next to stanleys car
larry gets out and looks around
after a moment he walks over to the door of room eight and knocks
a tired looking stanley opens the door
they stare at each other
im one of the guys that took your son
after a moment stanley steps back and opens the door
youd better come in
a car drives past the inn and then brakes sharply and skids across the road
it reverses and pulls in parking next to the hearse
barbara and susie get out and look around
then susie walks over to the hearses passenger window and raps on the glass and barbara marches to the back of the hearse and attempts to open it
wheres the catch on this piece of shit
susie notices phil slumped in the seat
phil comes to
he looks out of the window at susie then at the joshua tree sign then at the door to room eight then round to the back of the shaking hearse
as barbara tries to get the door open
his jaw drops open and he rubs his eyes again before getting out of the car
phil stands in front of susie
what happened to your head
he touches his head and looks at the blood on his fingers
his handcuff hangs from his wrist and susie stares at it
a hippie hit it
i thought youd gone
hold that thought
what the hell does that mean
i need to know what it is youre doing
barbara shouts from the back of the car
i told you what hes doing
hes going to set fire to my gram in some freaky ceremony with witches and black magic and
dolls to stick pins in
what the hell are you talking about
shouts i want my man back
enough of this shit
phil walks over to the door of room
theyve gotta be in here
he opens the door and walks in
larry and stanley are sitting on the bed
phil shoots a vicious look at larry
whatever happened to peace love and understanding hippie
stanley folds his arms
susie and barbara follow phil into the room
and you are
im with him
she indicates phil
the psychotic girlfriend
nothing wrong with your memory
he turns to phil
did you sell tickets or something
now you boys want to tell me why you stole my son
well i didnt even know he was in the box
im going to cremate him here in the desert where he felt most at home
thats what he wanted
the hell you are kaufman
stanley picks up the phone and starts to dial
you know i cant let you do that
i know you have to
stanley smashes the receiver down onto the table
i dont have to do anything mister kaufman
this is my loss
this was my son
how dare you try to take my grief away from me
its too late to claim him now
what the hell does that mean
they are almost nose to nose now
it means that you were never there when it mattered to gram
it means that you stopped being a father the moment he stopped doing your bidding
it means that you learned to care too late
thats what it means
i dont have to justify my relationship with gram to you
not to me no
stanley sits down
its true that when gram left college we drifted apart
he was a disappointment to me because he wouldnt use his brain
he had so much to offer but he let it trickle away
no he gave it his all but in a way you could never understand
and all he ever wanted from you was approval
he wanted you to be proud of what he had achieved
i kept everything
every record every article every photo
its no good telling me
you should have told him
i loved him
stanley looks up at phil
i understand that you were his right hand man as well as his friend
i was both yes
and that you werent there when he died
when he needed you most
a beat then yes
so the guilt isnt all mine then
i guess not
susie walks over and takes phils hand
stanley says nothing for a moment but his eyes fill with tears
you boys took away my son
i lost him once in life and now youre trying to take him from me again
he starts to cry
larry shoots an imploring look at phil
barbara glances around the room
can we just cut through this
she gestures at phil and larry
you two stole the body
sweetie im sorry but you seem to be in the whole thing up to your neck
waves a hand at stanley
and you are an old fool who should have called the police but hasnt
she walks over to the phone
now lets just call the cops and get it done
the sooner we get us a death certificate and bury him the sooner his soul will be properly laid to rest
phil walks over to barbara picks her up and carries her into the bathroom
what the hell are you doing
he emerges and slips the back of a chair under the handle effectively locking the door
son you had your chance to look after gram and now hes dead
there is a bang from the bathroom and the door shakes
i only failed because i couldnt save him from himself
you failed him all his life
you never believed
i never doubted
you tell me why i should let you take my boy
i was his road manager and his friend
we loved it out here in the desert and we made a pact that whoever died first the other would come down here and set them free
gram gave his word and i gave mine
stanley thinks about this
youre a couple of druggies
why should i believe you
phil doesnt like the inference
i dont take drugs
another bang from the bathroom
stanley turns to larry
what about you
are you a druggie
there is a long pause
yes i am
phil closes his eyes
stanley picks up the receiver and starts to dial
then phil jumps up off the bed and walks out of the room
after a moment larry and susie follow
phil is waiting by the car
to larry nice work
larry gives phil the screwdriver
i cant do this
this isnt right
larry walks away leaving phil with susie
he looks at her
just do whatever feels right to you
after a moment phil walks back into room eight
stanley is sitting on the bed the receiver in his hand
phil sits facing him
did you call them
are you going to call them
well you havent given me a reason not to
there is another crash from inside the bathroom
the door shakes
there isnt a reason
if someone tried to steal my sons body id stop them
larry and susie quietly enter the room
so you are prepared to go to jail
im expecting to
dont you worry its gonna happen
phil and stanley look up
what is it son
ive been a junkie for over four years
i started taking heroin on june th at a concert in indiana
you dont need
larry holds his hand up to stop stanley
ive taken heroin speed uppers downers blues morphine methadone mushrooms quaaludes acid valium barbiturates straight lsd marijuana marijuana laced with opium nembutal mescalin of course and medical methaqualone which made
me shake uncontrollably for six weeks and vomit every hour
dryly thats very impressive son
not my point
better make the point
i started working my way through that list on june th and since then there hasnt been a day when i didnt at least smoke one joint
phil shoots larry a dangerous look
are we sure that this is helping
larry ignores him
and now ive stopped
i stopped because it seems that i had something more important to do
they all look at him
he gestures at phil
hes doing this because he gave his word
im prepared to do this now because i think its right
and because i believe that each body has a soul
and grams soul doesnt belong in a family plot surrounded by strangers
it belongs here where he was happiest
in the silence susie walks over and grips phils hand
then stanley gets up off the bed
im going to go say goodbye to my son
everyone looks surprised
phil gives larry a look of appreciative approval
barbara starts to kick furiously at the door from inside the bathroom
stanley pauses for a moment and then walks outside
phil and larry watch him go and susie walks over to kiss phil
whats that for
thats for failing to reinforce my expectations
ill have to do that more often
the three of them move to the door and phil turns to larry
did you really take all those drugs
of course not
he grins at phil
i may have got a little carried away
the door of the bathroom shakes and one of the hinges flies across the room
cmon time to go
phil larry and susie leave room eight
they look around with surprise but there is no sign of stanley
phil opens the back of the hearse and takes a quick peek inside the casket
yeah he took the body and stuffed it in the trunk of his car before escaping into the night
larry is already behind the wheel
phil opens the car door and looks at susie
are you coming
she smiles at him
i reckon i am
she gets in
there is a final almighty crash from inside room eight
the three of them look at each other and then bernice is gone into the darkness
a moment later barbara runs outside
she leaps into her car and screeches after them
in the distance a blue flashing police light suddenly materializes
barbara is on the road driving fast
suddenly a blue flashing police light fills her mirror
she pulls over and the police cruiser pulls in behind her
the traffic cop walks up and looks through the window
barbara gives it everything
please help me theyve got my boyfriends corpse and theyre going to perform a ritual with his body
the cop turns on his torch and peers at her carefully
may i see your driving license please maam
my driving license
ive just told you that theyve stolen a body and you want to see my driving license
he just stares at her
barbara is losing it
you people are supposed to be on the lookout for a hearse
a hearse is a big long car
you can usually tell which ones are the hearses because they have coffins in the back
the one were looking for is painted yellow
does this look like a yellow hearse to you asshole
barbara realizes that she might have gone too far
he starts to write a ticket
is that a ticket
are you writing me a ticket
yes it is maam
and yes i am
phil indicates an area just off the road
this is perfect
larry pulls the hearse over near the rock
they all sit there for a moment
phil and larry look at each other
phil opens the back of the hearse and slides the casket out of the car
he notices that larry has made no move to help
susie sits on a rock and watches
you wanna give me a hand here
larry walks over and grabs the other end of the casket
they walk it away from the car and lay it down
as they lower it the coffin slips out of phils hands and bangs down in the sand
they stand and stare at the casket
susie walks over with the guitar and takes phils hand
he gets the gasoline can from the car and stands over the casket
take the top off
flesh burns easier than wood
i cant believe you just said that
im not taking the top off
he walks off
phil puts the can down and removes the top of the casket
he peers inside
to gram hey man
looking a little peaky
some decorum would be nice
he pours some gasoline into the casket
do you think thats enough
against his better judgment larry walks over and peers inside
well i dont know
maybe a little more
phil pours a little more fuel in
he looks over at susie
im not having a conversation with you about how much gasoline you need to burn a body
she backs off
i think thatll do it
phil stops pouring and shakes the can
only a little left
he pours the rest of the can into the casket
susie walks over to stand next to phil
he looks down at gram
im sorry i wasnt there for you when it mattered but i was there before and ive been there ever since
gram good luck to you wherever you are
they all stare at the casket
phil wipes a tear away and tucks a can of beer into the coffin
thats my last one man
he rests grams guitar against the casket takes big puffs on his cigar to get the flame up then tosses it into the coffin
phil edges nearer and looks inside
then the coffin explodes into flames
all three of them are thrown backwards by the blast
the traffic cop is finishing the ticket when there is a ball of flame in the distance
barbara just scowls
what the hells that
thatll be gram parsons on fire
get in the car maam
phil larry and susie pick themselves up
they stare at the pyre
phil is close to tears and susie puts her arm around him
for a moment phil thinks he sees the flames morph into the shape of an angel over the burning coffin
the image disappears when larry speaks
maybe too much fuel
nah i just didnt factor in the booze inside of him
he breaks off as a flashing police light appears in the darkness followed by a siren
i think our work here is done
larry and susie run to the car
phil lingers a moment looking down at the flames
then he follows the others
phil jumps into the car
the huge car screeches off into the darkness with no lights
stanley watches as the hearse flies past him
he glances back at the fire smiles sadly and bows his head for a moment
then he turns on the ignition and drives away into the darkness
the police car arrives at the scene
barbara and the cop get out
he peers into the flames
how do you know its your boyfriend
sarcastically i recognize that birthmark on his shoulder
look can i make an observation
be my guest
were in the desert
it is dark
if you want to catch someone in the dark its best not to turn on big flashing lights and make a loud noise with a siren
do you want to know what i think maam
but im really really keen to find out
the traffic cop stares into the fire
i think it was suicide
he just wanted to get away from you
phil is fast asleep and snoring in bernices passenger seat
he wakes slowly and shields his eyes from the bright sunshine that pours through the windscreen
he pulls a flask out of the glove compartment and takes a long gargle spitting the result out of the window
then he glances in the rear view mirror and sees the man sitting in the casket bay
sure is hot
gram pulls himself along the bay and onto the back seat
he then climbs into the front settles next to phil and holds his hand out for the flask
do you think you should
not gonna hurt me now is it
he takes a drink and looks around
theyre very handy for transporting dead people around
i am dead then
youre more than dead gram
you and the box are down to bones and brass
heres mud in your eye
he takes another drink and hands the flask back to phil
what can i do for you gram
you assume i want something
well youre here
and seeing as i just burned you to a cinder you shouldnt be
so im guessing youve got some kind of reason
i just wanted to say thanks
doing the thing that we agreed keeping your word keeping them all away
well thats okay gram
but i dont need thanking
im just taking care of business
thats what you paid me for thats what i do
you shooting for a raise
actually i just quit
gram holds his hand out for the bottle and takes a drink
well i spose i should be getting along
im glad it all worked out
i said im glad it all worked out
and gram is now larry peering down at phil
all what worked out
phil sits bolt upright and looks around the car
larry and susie stare back at him
can we go now
im getting sick of sand
we hear grams return of the grievous angel or some similar music
we follow bernice as she drives through the desert and into los angeles
we follow her through the city streets and we stay with her as she parks
fade down music
phil turns off the ignition and sits back in his seat
he and larry look at each other
well we did it
we saved a soul
he leans across to hug phil who looks awkward and pats him on the shoulder instead
singed my damn mustache thats for sure
phil pulls a cigar out of his pocket and lights it
the handcuff dangles from his wrist and bangs against the dash
he stares at the match as it burns
well shall we
phil blows the match out
lets roll hippie
they all get out of the car
phil turns to susie
where dyou think you might be when im done
ill be waiting
yeah but where
there is a small moment of tension before phil grins at her
get out of here
phil pats bernices battered wing as he walks away and over to where larry is waiting
they cross the road and walk into a building through heavy wooden doors
pull back to reveal a sign los angeles police department
fade up on super phil kaufman and larry osterberg appeared in west l
municipal court on november gram parsonss th birthday
since a corpse has no intrinsic value the two were charged with misdemeanor theft for stealing the coffin and given a token punishment in damages for the coffin and a
fine for each of the bodysnatchers
