written by david congalton july north hayworth avenue off sunset boulevard
a quiet tree lined residential street
note the small apartment complex set back from the curb
our narrator is henry obert o burt
this is where where f
scott fitzgerald died on december
insert archival photos of fitzgerald
fitzgerald was one of the truly great american writers of the th century
tender is the night
the last tycoon
this side of paradise
and of course my favorite the great gatsby
but fitzgerald ended up out here
writing movies that never got made
drinking too much
losing his way
henry stands on the sidewalk
full of promise and hope
wears a pizza delivery outfit as he stares at the apartment more with reverence than curiosity
i stop by here sometimes out of respect
fitzgerald had this amazing gift
henry crosses the street heading for his parked honda
he unlocks the car
swings open the back door
but he wasted it
he wasted his talent
henry yanks a magnetic sign out of the back seat and slaps it on the outside of the drivers door pizza starz
one last glance at the fabled apartment complex
when i sell my novel i wont make his mistakes
the man s and woman s sit on the couch in their tastefully decorated san fernando valley home
expensive taste in clothes
her cleavage a bit too obvious
both seem a little uncomfortable
they look off to the side speaking to someone off camera
we thought this was going to be a reality series
you know like the kardashians
here comes the bad news
this is going to be a documentary about our writing group
the whole group
not just us right
not that it should be just about us
they look at each other a documentary
they try to mask their disappointment
so this is going to be like like what i saw the other night on cable
about bees mating
or that um that one about the holocaust
colette nods remembering
we love documentaries
they look at each other again what have we gotten into
natasha the russian peasant dressed oh so slowly
a poster board sign someone went to kinkos is posted prominently reading quiet please writers at work
reading consumed totally completely absolutely by endless thoughts of yuri fondling her breast his other hand groping her womanhood knowing
they sit around the dining room table
colette convinced shes the next amy tan reads aloud from her typed pages
the others all have copies in front of them
we recognize henry the frog waiting to become a prince making copious notes and alan oh so proud hanging on every word
three others round out the group younger man early s
always thinks hes the coolest guy in any room
cant avoid glances at the camera
the oldest member of the group over sits with his arms folded as he listens shifting in his chair
finally the young mid to late s angelic woman listening intently the one who probably stopped to rescue a cat on her way here
any second that she might explode her chastity spraying across the ceiling
spraying across the ceiling like passionate graffiti
natasha never thought such a moment possible
have i satisfied you natasha
yuri had inquired after their fourth round of vodka soaked lovemaking
nyet not yet natasha stated exhausted but grateful
awkward silence around the table as colette removes her reading glasses and waits
alan clears his throat looking cheerful
henrys sparse studio apartment
his laptop is set up on an old door stretched across some blue plastic crates
there are books piled everywhere
all sorts of books
and paper pieces of paper including letters and cards and printed emails dozens of them are taped throughout the small apartment
we are introduced to henry the writer pondering over his battered laptop pacing up and down the floor checking his nearly empty refrigerator stretched out on his goodwill couch watching
henry rushes to his desk and taps out a sentence or two on his computer feeling proud for his accomplishment
i graduated from the university of illinois
taught high school for a couple years but hated it
moved out here to be a writer
as henrys voice over continues we see him in uniform with pizza in hand at the front door of a house
i work two jobs
delivering pizzas and cleaning carpets
good jobs for a writer
henry cleaning the carpets as the heavily tattooed motorcycle dude points to a dirty spot over here
you meet lots of interesting people
henry points to the letters on the wall
picks up on phrases like we regret to inform you or sorry but this story isnt right for us or the baxter agency currently isnt accepting new clients
i have two unpublished novels
working on my third pizza to go
these are my rejection letters
rejected by agents
rejected by publishers
when you think about it its pretty amazing how many ways people can reject you
henry john alan colette hannah and william sit around the table
impressive buffet of cold cuts cheeses and shrimp has been set out
our writing group meets every tuesday night
mostly at alan and colettes
sometimes we rotate
john helps himself to some shrimp
then helps himself to some more
i love coming to the group
everyone always has such constructive feedback
its like were all in this together
i really like the way yuri is developing colette
well if you ask john k
cant help looking at the camera
making sure its on him
youre still going to have to explain why this natasha dame goes awol on her husband
still kinda iffy to me
another glance at the camera did you get that
i was bothered by that too
why would natasha betray a reliable dependable husband for a washed up young punk
all eyes on colette
she shifts in her chair
an uneasy silence
colette is blocked nowhere to go creatively
her face tightens up
bites her lip
ive been rewriting and rewriting and rewriting and poodles
its not ok
i still cant explain natashas motive
whats the use
im not a writer
william to the rescue
the dudes good in bed
trust me thats all the motive she needs
torpedo chapter three
blow it up
get the focus back on this broad natasha
i was thinking the same thing
make it clear that natasha wants to be closer
colette makes notes furiously nodding in agreement
writing can be such a solitary existence so its good to have this outlet where you can meet other writers and exchange ideas
here it really is all for one and one for all
later that evening
meeting is over
alan colette hannah henry william and john are all standing up now
john reaches for more shrimp
who wants coffee
william taps henry on the shoulder
lend me ten bucks
im having cash flow issues
youre the best
henry sits at his desk staring at the blank computer
lost in thought
emphasis on lost
this new novel pizza to go is about scott a pizza delivery guy in la
he comes across some interesting characters
i like what i have so far but its only a hundred pages and im stuck
henry stands in front of the mirror in his apartment wearing the pizza starz hat and shirt
ready for work
havent written a word in the last two weeks
hannah teases me about having writers block
flashback to the last group meeting
focus on hannah
she listens and comments
actively engaged in the conversation
i keep thinking about her
shes all i think about
really would like to ask her out
hannah reaches for a pair of reading glasses and slips them on
talks to someone o
what do you think
on or off
do they make me look smarter
i need a new pair
she takes the glasses off
puts them back on
hannah prepares herself with a series of quick breaths and waves her hands in the air
then she stares directly into the camera
im originally from prescott arizona
followed my mom out here about four years ago
thats her back there
camera picks up a wisp of a woman over in the background waving with an equally pleasant smile
my parents are divorced
not her fault
william favors jeans and faded tweed jacket
sits in the corner of a valley restaurant nursing a cup of coffee and talks to the camera
what do you want to know about me
he flashes that wicked seductive smile
hometown is modesto california a sprawling junk heap of a town without a soul
why did i come to la
um because i knew you were here and that youd loan me a hundred bucks if i needed it
waitress refills his coffee cup
her reward is that smile
she walks away
william admires the view
i already got her number
maybe ill text her
maybe i wont
eyes back towards the camera
so bout that hundred bucks
what dya think
a hint of desperation in his voice
what about fifty
support the arts
hannah continues talking to the camera
maureen still in background
ive always had this knack for telling stories
ever since i was a kid
shes a natural
took a couple writing classes
decided to go for it
total dedication to my craft
the writing always comes first
my latest effort is called sleeping on the moon
its about rejection
not really about the moon itself
more of a
she searches for the word that escapes her
maureen to the rescue
william continues talking to the camera
im here because of bukowski
greatest writer ever
insert archival photos of charles bukowski
la is his town man
if im gonna be a writer then i have to walk in bukowskis shoes
experience and capture the plight of the working class
he waves to waitress
i like the people in the group
but they cant write worth shit
but man hannah is something
shes the only reason i keep going
not because im learning anything
i just think shes hot
hannah leans forward towards the camera as if to hear better
my favorite writer
hannah goes blank
the smile disappears as her face goes into noticeable contortions
this is worse than final jeopardy
she turns quiet squirming
hard to say
ive studied composition more than actual literature
i know maureen enjoys jane
searching for a last name hannah looks back to maureen for help
thats the one
i hear shes good
but my favorite writer
let me think about that a bit ok
hannah lowers her voice almost a loud confessional whisper
i didnt go to college
john is holding court at his mobile home showcasing the finest in furniture from sears
john stuffs his home with various military artifacts photos equipment books
hes got it all
john talks to the camera
everything john k
butzin knows about writing comes down to two simple words tom clancy
the mans a genius
does his research
all those nitty gritty technical details
now thats writing
butzin has one agent very interested in roaring lion
and a publisher up in oxnard is looking at it as we speak
plus a certain cousins best friend has a neighbor who has an in with clint eastwood so hollywood might be calling soon
dont know how the other members of the writing group will handle all this success by one person
they better not be pussies
alan and colette remain on the couch
talking to the camera
much more comfortable with the camera
well im an optometrist in glendale
and i write full time
our last names mooney
you could call us mooneys
we get that joke all the time
the couple giggle at the joke
which writer do i admire
how about john grisham
look at all that money hes made
just teasing john
we know you deserved every dime but hey john could you spread it around a bit pal
alan likes to tease
she gives her husband an affectionate squeeze
colette here is the real writer
im more of an idea guy
i come up with great ideas but dont always follow through
ill show you
he picks up his mini digital olympus recorder off the coffee table
thinks for a second
to recorder idea for romantic novel
alan catches himself
make that idea for romantic ebook
he winks at the camera showing hes hip to the jargon
possible movie option too frovers
they couldnt be friends
they couldnt be lovers
so they became frovers
satisfied alan turns off the recorder
colette opens the sliding glass door and steps out into a beautiful garden area
quiet and private
camera follows her over to a solitary bench
this is where i come for inspiration
i believe a writer must have quiet and solitude
write in my journal
set out my creative path for the day
this is my walden pond
colette sits down on the bench
takes in the environment
id have to say joan didion
her writing sends shivers down my spine
though joyce carol oates has been known to bring me to actual orgasm
colette sits on her bench reading a book
reveals that it is a novel by joyce carol oates
colette appears to be getting into the story just a bit too much
pool guy and gardener hear colettes sensual cries drifting over the hedge
what the hell
they exchange puzzled looks
back to the present
camera picks up a framed photo of oprah from a corner of the bench
holds it up for camera
i keep oprah out here for luck
shes done so much to help writers
i know im going to be on her television show one day
i just know it
colette can already see the moment in her mind
then she looks off camera listening to someone
oprah doesnt have a tv show anymore
short beat as she hears the answer
short beat as she tries to cover
i knew that
i i knew
henry stands in front of his mirror
checks his appearance
talks to the camera
tonights the night
im going to ask hannah out
henry becomes lost in thought
i like her
she likes me i think
ive got to take action
still stuck on page
so im asking hannah out on a date tonight
itll be great
and ill put this writers block behind me
checks his appearance one last time in the mirror
wish me luck
alan sits in his favorite chair talking directly to the camera
im the group leader
after all getting together was my idea
theyre all my patients
thats how we met
first one published gets a free eye exam
alan cackles a bit too hard at that joke
he listens to a question being asked
why did i form the group
to help colette
oh i certainly enjoy the creative process but colette
writing is her dream
id do anything for her because
because shes my dream
so there you have it
alan reaches for his tape recorder
possible names for future characters
make that anthony t
a man known simply as banjo
satisfied alan turns off the recorder
place is empty
alan colette william john and henry gather around the center table
the writers at work poster is propped up against a nearby empty chair
hard not to notice the empty chair at the table
hannah is missing
waitress pours coffee all around
henry fidgets in his chair focused on the empty chair
to william how come we never chow down at your place
this is my place
close to the working people
john rolls his eyes
alan checks his watch
time to get started
shouldnt we wait for hannah
lets go people
im ready to read
shell show up
william starts passing out pages
henry eyes the empty chair
colette looks over williams pages
there are only three
she has a puzzled look
william arent these the same pages you read last time
nope theyre different
they look the same
i changed a word
writing is rewriting colette
bukowski said write five words
dorothy parker said that
its my creative vision john
jumping in which we are here to support
this is williams decision
let me just read
see if you can pick out the word
tell me if its better or worse
muttering one goddamn word
henry continues staring at the empty chair
the evening meeting is winding to an end
john stands up to stretch
alan slides papers into his leather satchel
hannahs chair remains empty
henry remains concerned
i wonder what happened to hannah
its not like her to miss
the mystery is quickly solved
front door opens
in rushes hannah dashing directly towards the others looking harried
im so sorry
im so sorry for missing the meeting
your car break down
is maureen ok
look at her
hannah met a guy
she got laid
hannah gives william a playful smack on the back
as a matter of fact i did meet a guy
his names brian
check out henry
he looks absolutely horrified
hannah takes a deep breath and flashes a smile the size of the grand canyon
hes my new agent
she remembers the camera
directly to camera an agent
ive got an agent
surprise and silence
the writers look at each other and then back at hannah
not quite sure how to react
stunned as hannah turns her attention back to the group
that writing class i took
well for the final project i turned in the first chapter of sleeping on the moon
i guess the teacher liked it
then he gave it to his friend whos an agent
had to see me right away
brian wants to sign me
bet brian wants more than that
playful smack from colette to william on the shoulder behave
thats so great hannah
i salute you young lady
and he does
henry takes it all in quietly unable to speak
alan bounces up and gives hannah a big hug as the others immediately start peppering her with questions
colette alan john william and henry encircle a beaming hannah as waitress snaps their photo
alan pops the drugstore champagne and pours into the cheap plastic cups as colette passes them around to hannah henry john and william
raising cup to hannah
everyone clinks their cups together
but i just want to remind everyone that were all in this together
i couldnt have come this far without the group
smiling all for one
but our camera picks up on the individual writers and something is amiss
everything seems a beat off
people appear happy but a little subdued
the joy seems a bit too forced
im merely the first one to get signed
but were all going to have an agent soon
well as a matter of fact theres an agent in santa monica very interested in john k
hes reading the manuscript as we speak
the others let johns remark pass without comment
william taps henry on the shoulder
lower voice hey can you lend me ten bucks
henry is still a bit dazed by this unexpected turn of events
youre the best
henrys eyes cant leave hannah
the front door to the restaurant swings open and the writing group members tumble out into the evening
alan carries his writers at work sign
william makes a move towards hannah but the the ever protective henry grabs her gently by her elbow cutting william off
they start walking in one direction
william and john head out in the other
meanwhile alan and colette wave enthusiastically to hannah
congratulations again hannah
way to go hannah
calling back thank you
alan and colette continue to smile and wave until hannah is out of ear shot
well hannahs got an agent
she must have slept with him
of course she did
henry and hannah arrive at her car
she unlocks the front door of her clunker of a ford as henry waits
im so proud of you hannah
your turn will come henry
youre a better writer than i am
so much better
you went to college
hannah looks directly into the camera pointing to henry
hes a great writer
i knew him when
henry clearly embarrassed puts his hand up to block the camera
tries to change the subject
maybe some afternoon we could go for a drive
there are some special places id like to show you
i cant believe ive lived out here four years and havent seen she stops in mid sentence
a light goes on in her head
its been four years since i moved here
and now i have an agent
its the number four again
my lucky number
i should have known this was going to happen
there is no one more deserving
hannah rewards henrys praise with a peck on the lips
and a warm hug
hannah steps in her car starts it up and rolls down the window
im going to dedicate my novel to you
a final wave and henry watches as she disappears into the night
a series of shots featuring the writers writing or at least trying alan pauses between eye appointments to record an idea
william continues scribbling at the restaurant this time eyeing waitress
hannah sitting cross legged on her bed types away on her laptop computer
colette sits on her private bench seeking inspiration
john sits at his keyboard
vintage black and white war movie plays on the tv
john appears more interested in the movie
henry stares at his laptop
the screen is blank
henry surrenders yet again and flips off the computer
henry sitting in his studio apartment wears his pizza delivery outfit
ready for work
talks to the camera
im happy for hannah
still her getting an agent sort of ruins my plans doesnt it
i mean hannah has an agent
that wont work for dating
i cant ask her out until i get an agent
henry gestures at a photograph taped to the wall among his rejection letters
thats richard benedict
hes written seven novels
insert archival photos of richard benedict
the fitzgerald of his generation
richard benedict made me want to be a writer
colette dressed in a leotard practices basic yoga on a mat in her living room
overly dramatic as always
takes a break and talks to the camera
my novel is called nyet not yet
its about a russian woman who comes to this country in search of love
it was inspired by a story i heard from one of my massage clients yuri
yes its true i used to do massage
in fact thats how i met alan though i certainly didnt give him the kind of massage he really wanted
at least not the first time
colette allows herself a slight smile at the memory
i will get an agent
it comes down to this if hannah can get an agent i can get an agent
after all i am a graduate of mills college
plopped down in her rocking chair hannah talks to someone o
maureen goes about her day in the background
have i thought of my favorite author yet
there are so many you know
the deep breaths and waving of hands begin again
here comes that smile as she looks directly into the camera
i am somewhat superstitious
im drawn to the number
i was born at exactly p
on april th
that wasnt an accident
shes dead serious
certain things ive learned to avoid
and the number especially
i hate the number
conversation interrupted by ringing doorbell
hannah frowns at the interruption as maureen scurries to the door and opens it revealing colette hiding behind a huge gift basket
she breezes in
over the top
i was just in the neighborhood and colette freezes when she notices the camera
im so sorry
i didnt know theyd be here yeah right
hannah springs up
follows colette as she sets the basket down for all to admire
what a lovely surprise
hugs all around between hannah and maureen and colette
hannah looks blown away by the gift basket
my whats this
i just had to say congratulations to my new favorite author
hannah is truly touched
maureen notices a card attached to the basket
reading for poodles
now may we have sex again
embarrassed colette snatches the card from maureen
hannah is more focused on the gift
doesnt really hear
so sweet of you colette
about your agent
hannah looks over at colette what
is he is he taking on new clients
i dont really know
colette blurts out without thinking
think you could ask
awkward situation for hannah
how best to respond
i guess so
because if he is
lets talk about this at group meeting ok
the three women wait for one another to speak
colette checks her watch
a hug for both maureen and hannah
ive got to go
by the way everything in the basket gluten free
a final wave to the camera and colette disappears
my that woman is something else
a light goes off in hannahs head
to herself counting on her fingers colette mooney
c o l e t t e m o o n e
she cant finish the count
the ugly truth is staring her in the face
hannah and maureen exchange concerned looks
hannah and henry sit together in the reception area
alan breezes in ever smiling greeting both enthusiastically
rows of eye glasses on display as alan guides hannah over to the fitting table
henry tags along
thanks for seeing me today alan
lets get you some new eye wear
something that makes me look smart
youre already smart hannah
hannah gives henrys hand a playful squeeze thank you
alan and hannah sit down opposite from each other
henry pulls up a chair to the side
alan selects a pair
puts them on hannah
hannah shrugs her blase reaction
alan removes the brown colored frames
studies them for a second
then inspiration arrives
he reaches inside his coat pocket for his recorder
speaks into it
name for character
wears brown colored glasses
of course he would
henry nods agreeing
satisfied alan puts the recorder away and reaches for another pair of glasses
you know this great idea for a novel hit me this morning
its called unleashed
alan tries the second pair on hannah
she checks herself in the mirror
then she shows henry
they both shake their head no
it is a funny moment between friends
they laugh as alan reaches for pair
its about a dog who becomes human for hours in order to rescue his kidnapped owner
i love this idea hannah
could be a winner
alan puts the third pair of glasses on hannah
she checks herself in the mirror finally liking what she sees
she looks over towards henry
what do you think
she does look good
hes falling even harder for her by the moment
you look great hannah
hannah cant decide
she studies herself in the mirror as henry studies her
henry reaches for his android and snaps a photo of her
alan brings them back to real time
question you think your agent might be interested in this idea
does he have a dog
i dont know how about a cat
it could be a cat
probably could be
think about mentioning it to your agent ok
dog or cat becomes human
alan beams with pride at his imagination on display
henry jumps in to save the moment
ill help you develop the idea alan
alan looks pleased
hannah looks grateful
the two middle aged women customer and customer sit across from each other in the nearly deserted restaurant
body language suggests an intense passionate personal chat
a writer has to hear everything
on the streets
in the restaurants
but somethings amiss
customer stops abruptly glancing at the table next to them william has suddenly materialized
sitting with a cup of coffee and a legal pad scribbling
my dialogue has to be real so im everywhere
standing behind you at the checkout stand
customer resumes conversation but looks sharply back at william
his head is tilted towards them
peeing next to you at the urinal
customer says something to customer
looks back at william
his head is still cocked as he makes notes
writing down scraps of conversation
customer grows more agitated
customer tries to calm her down
finally customer shoots up and marches over to william her finger jabbing in the air towards the notebook
william shrugs playing dumb
customer reaches down and grabs the notebook from william
he tries to stop her but too late
how else do you accurately capture the misery of the human condition
she reads the page and shows it to cutomer who reads the notes and is equally shocked
now bukowski says an intellectual says a simple thing in a hard way
the two women start yelling at william
he keeps shaking his head
customer tears the page into shreds
an artist says a hard thing in a simple way
waitress comes over
the women talk to her and she starts yelling at william
customer poking her finger in his chest
escalates to a push
the cook comes out and starts yelling at william
gotta love it
surrounded by yelling people william breaks through the circle and moves towards the door
the bus boy yells too
john grins for the camera
the reason why sits next to him in the matching lawn chairs
the woman is clearly younger than john
plainly dressed in a faded sweat shirt
nervous in front of the camera but she looks more at us than she does at john
he cant keep his eyes off her
meet someone very s p e c i e l
here with us today all the way from
coaxing sigrid to finish the thought
found her working at the hardware store
went in for a drill bit
came out with a prime candidate for mrs
watch sigrid work
running cash register
consulting her boss an older man
always wearing a red employee vest
she does speak with a thick accent
sincere if naive
starts speaking german
in english apologies
i come from dusseldorf yes

took job in store as cleaning lady
promoted to cashier

sigrid stands next to a wall display

photo of jay leno
whatever comes to mind for the u

this my wall of america tribute yes

and in the center of course the three men i admire most in america
first we see the framed photo of a certain business mogul
then we move on to the second photo of a certain tv celebrity
herr simon cowell
move on to the third photo
hey we know this person ja
my special guy
about to become very rich
already very sexy
beat then maybe sigrid hagenguth becomes mrs
focused on the white envelope in one hand
alan sits next to her squeezing her other hand
photo of oprah on the other side
i know this is a rejection letter
i cant open this
i cant be rejected today
i take rejection so personally
i bet its good news
she opens the envelope
just the smallest post it note flutters out on to the ground
colette picks it up
i knew it
how can such a big rejection come from such a small piece of paper
colette folds the post it note in half and then in quarters
holding it in her hand she begins to chant
alan holds on to her hand and pats her on the back
hannah and maureen watch with interest and obvious appreciation as henry dutifully wearing his uniform cleans their living room carpet
open pizza starz ibox on the breakfast bar
looks like henry has brought dinner as well
hannahs iphone goes off
as a courtesy henry stops the machine
on phone hello
oh hi brian
listening oh my god
oh my god
oh my god
hannah starts jumping up and down like a little girl while maureen and henry look on in bewildered anticipation
on phone oh my god
whats he saying
he sold my novel
nodding excitedly brian sold sleeping on the moon
now maureen starts jumping up and down
henry cant hide his surprise
oh my god
oh my god
on telephone yes brian
hannah turns off her iphone
mother and daughter cant believe the news
jumping up and down
in turn they both embrace henry who also shares the genuine sincere moment
you did it hannah
you did it
im so proud of you dear
another embrace between mother and daughter
this could go on all night
we need to tell the group
the smile disappears from hannahs face
no no i cant tell them about this
she looks to maureen for support
it will seem like im bragging or something
i mean im the one with an agent
it could be too much too soon dont you think
he wants to help
suppose i tell them
they could hear the news from me
hannah lights up at the suggestion
she goes to henry and gives him a tight hug
so very tight
blesses him with another friendly peck on the lips
thank you my friend
i can always depend on you cant i
john talks to the camera
thats great for hannah her little book deal and all
but john k
butzin has some news to announce as well
john holds up a brochure
ive just inked a deal with u r the publisher a reputable company based in new delhi
they publish titles internationally every year

ive waited for this moment forever
finally a butzin is going to be a published author
a voice drifts in from another room
published author to be
sigrid would like you to come in for personal private autograph
then he remembers the camera
makes a cut motion with his finger across the neck
henrys turn to host the group meeting
alan william colette and john share the lumpy couch and the folding metal chairs
open pizza starz boxes in the background
everyone is enjoying a single slice of pizza off a paper plate except for john who is inhaling two pieces at once
the mood is somber
hannahs just lucky
john tries to agree but his mouth is too stuffed with pizza
cheap flowers from ralphs and balloons in full display on the coffee table
henry stands listening by the front door
here she comes
henry opens the door
hannah floats in
the serious expressions suddenly magically turn to broad smiles
henry is the first to offer a hug
alan william colette john give her a standing ovation
hannah notices the balloons and flowers
you shouldnt have
way to go ms
everyone gets a hug from hannah
william gives hannah an extra long hug
were all jealous hannah
were all jealous
nervous laughter around the room
youre all making too much of a spectacle here

so how much did you get
dont ask her that
shrugging why not
how much did you get
i did ok

whats important is that i owe this success to all of you
i would be lost without this writing group
louder than normal i dont know if anyone heard
all eyes turn to john still inhaling pizza
the publisher has agreed to publish roaring lion by john k
puzzled looks are the reaction

ever diplomatic well john
she leans over and gives him the briefest of hugs
there are other congratulatory murmurs coming from the group
my two published authors in the group
the rest of us are going to have to catch up
the meeting gets down to business
alan colette henry william and hannah wearing her new glasses listen as john reads from roaring lion
reading gunner stared out over the bleak horizon seeing one dead viet cong after another lay scattered on the bloody hillside
he had won this time but gunner knew charlie would be back in the morning
by god he would be ready
so would his m general purpose machine gun and mark fragmentation hand rifle grenade
john finishes and sits back in his chair quite pleased with himself
lets get some feedback
henry as always has been making notes
in terms of the characters jumping in hold on obert
i wanna hear from her
john points towards hannah
well hear from everybody
i dont want to hear from everybody
she has a book coming out
butzin has a book coming out
i want to hear from hannah author to author
oh screw you
this is really going against the spirit of the group john
everyones opinion is valid
hers is more valid
whatd you think hannah
hannah struggles to speak
the words freeze in her mouth
standing up going outside for a smoke
william thunders away from the group
colette watches him go
ill go talk to him
colette follows calling after william
lets take a fifteen minute break shall we
embarrassed hannah excuses herself
henry trails along after her leaving a muttering john and calm alan alone
alan reaches for his recorder
talks into it
ahhh idea for michael crichton type novel
members of antarctic research station attacked by mutant penguins
satisfied alan turns off the recorder while john reaches for more pizza
colette is back on her bench
standing behind her is a mysterious man over who favors black clothes and dark shades
i want you to meet someone special
this is my spiritual adviser
doctor xiroman has taken a vow of silence for one full year to protest climate change
what an amazing man
xiroman is going to cleanse the air of all this rejection
camera goes to dr
does he even have a pulse
xiroman walks over to small fire pit and meditates as he places his hands over the rising flames
colette begins a new age chant for added support
three young men in the corner booth
jeans and baseball caps
very animated conversation
loud punctuated by laughter
they think theyre the only people in the joint
the waitress eudora s with the purple streaks in her hair and matching purple glasses refills their cups
william sits alone at the counter impossible to hide his disdain
he talks to the camera with the three men in the background
see those jokers back there
they write for tv
towns full of them
anything for a paycheck
who wants to suck my william scoffs as the disdain drips from his mouth
gimme a break
theyve sold their souls to the devil
a house in malibu
a tennis court
william glances over his shoulder shaking his head in disgust
another table catches his eye
two attractive women engage in friendly banter over coffee
william stares them down making friendly eye contact
the woman facing him returns eye contact
william smiles watching them as he continues
that will never be me
i will never compromise my vision for financial gain
id rather borrow money from friends than sell out for a quick dollar
the two women stand up
william is stoked
this is too easy
but the women instead go to the three tv writers
immediately invited to sit down with them
william cant believe it
gatsby had an extraordinary gift for hope a romantic readiness
henry reads from the great gatsby
such as i have never found in any other person and which it is not likely i shall ever find again
henry is always moved whenever he reads fitzgerald
putting down the book he talks to the camera
you know the year before he died
scott fitzgerald made a grand total of
in royalties from his writing
i guess hannahs right about being unlucky
a question is asked o
i know that
gatsby does end tragically
but thats fiction
our story will have a happy ending
maybe a happy ending
his confidence flies out the door
hope we have a happy ending
alan and colette hold court on their living room couch talking to the camera
theres been one rule in this house
whatever colette wants colette gets
thank you alan
they look at each other adoringly
real or fake
she wants a mercedes
her own business
colette eats it up
call it karma or serendipity or kismet
but it just so happens that very well known literary agent david keller interrupting very well known
hes so known
well guess who is coming in tomorrow to see dr
alan mooney for an eye examination and new glasses
colette starts squealing in anticipation
alan nods with confidence and flashes a thumbs up
i love you poodles
love you more poodles
the casually dressed man s sits in the waiting area for alan mooney spending time on his iphone conducting business as he waits
he doesnt have to wait long
alan personally comes out into the waiting area to fetch him
david caught off guard by the doctors sudden appearance winds up his phone conversation
on phone let me call you back
david stands up
they shake hands
david cant help but notice the camera
theyre doing a little documentary about my writing group
just act natural
lowering his voice
it was supposed to be a reality series
standard examination room
alan guides david into the chair
lets start out with a basic eye examination
alan flips a couple switches
eye reading chart appears on the wall
alan turns off the lights
see if you can read that first line for me please
reading very good david
would you like to try for whats behind door number three
try this one please
alan brings up a different line on the screen
looking good david
but anyone can identify simple letters and numbers
lets see how you do reading a more challenging text
alan brings up a different page
several paragraphs on a printed page
read me the first paragraph please
reading monotone natasha the russian peasant dressed oh so slowly consumed totally completely absolutely by endless thoughts of yuri
now the next paragraph please
david looks rather puzzled but complies
reading monotone i never ever thought i could feel this way natasha said excitedly
nor could i yuri said happily his body dripping with enormous beads of sweat
isnt that great writing
my wife colette wrote that
the patients just love reading her stuff
its from her new novel nyet not yet
a loud knock on the examination room door
david is saved by the bell
my i wonder who that could be
he walks over to the door opens it and feigns surprise to see colette
she moves right in
so sorry to intrude
gee this is an incredible coincidence
we were just talking about you
and here you are
colette is locked like a laser beam on david keller
oh where are my manners
colette this is david keller
david this is my wife colette mooney
pleasure to meet you david
actually colette wrote this beautiful prose youve been reading david
honey i cant believe this coincidence
well i was just dropping off overlapping oh of course
thanks for bringing it by
say honey davids been reading that first page of yours
you dont happen to have any more of that opening chapter do you
colette thinks for a second
as a matter of fact i think i do
i think i do
colette searches her large purse and produces a manila folder
say how about that
colette hands the manila folder to david who accepts it reluctantly
hes been had
how about that
colette sits in the chair alan stands behind her massaging her shoulders
both share that smirk of satisfaction
that went very well
oh yes poodles
though david keller did seem in a hurry to leave
the sooner he can begin reading
colette buys that
i bet he calls tomorrow with an offer
i bet he calls tonight
alans left hand starts to slide down towards colettes chest
she doesnt notice her mind is elsewhere
david takes colettes pages and tosses them in city trash can muttering to himself as he walks away
overlapping alan i did it
overlapping colette we did it
hannah sits cross legged on her living room floor wearing her new glasses reading typed pages
henry sits close to her
not too close
this is good
but ive only got pages
cant seem to move forward
im dying to know more about scott and christy
what great characters
sure wish i knew what was going to happen with them
hannah gives henry a friendly tap on the knee for encouragement
youll figure it out henry
focus on your writing
the writing comes first
henry lets it sink in
changes the subject
say um remember i offered to drive you around and show you a couple special places
the imposing house screams success
henry and hannah sit in henrys parked car taking it in
who lives here
that writer you like
its much more than that
henry struggles to put it into words
reading richard benedict
made me want to be a better writer
hes that good hannah
cant say ive read his stuff
nice house though
henry and hannah stand on the sidewalk in front of the north hayworth home
henry seems barely able to contain his excitement
here we are
hannah stares blankly at the house
north hayworth avenue
hannah smiles politely but its clear she doesnt recognize the house
big clue time
still nothing registers with hannah
writer sheila graham lived here
fitzgerald was her lover
this is where he died on december
hannah lets it all sink in
hes the one who shot himself right
he wrote the great gatsby
the name doesnt register with hannah
reciting from heart gatsby believed in the green light the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us
it eluded us then but thats interjecting ive never read it
henry cant hide his surprise
hannah stops cognizant of the ever present camera
to camera could you turn that off for a few minutes please
you know they cant
counts to three
lowers her voice
ive never read the great gatsby
i never went to college
ive heard of hemingway
but i dont have your education
i havent read all these great novels
my stories come from my heart
henry lets it all sink in
hannah looks at the house
tell me about the book
gatsby is about social position and the american dream and
rethinks his explanation
actually its quite simple
boy meets girl
boy loses girl
boy moves heaven and earth to win the girl back
and its your favorite
henry nods with his heart
so how does it end
does boy get the girl
then henry reaches into the back seat of his car for his knapsack
puts it on his lap unzips it
pulls out his personal copy of gatsby
take my copy
he hands the well read book to hannah
now you can find out for yourself
john is on the telephone clutching a copy of roaring lion
he does not look happy
on telephone yes
im still holding
where are you again
john stares at his book shaking his head
waits for a few seconds
sigrid is in the background doing light housekeeping trying not to listen but obviously cant avoid it
on telephone butzin
well i have a copy of my book you sent but there must be some mistake
well you put a dog on the cover
not a lion like we agreed
john holds the book up for the camera to catch the unmistakable dog barking on the front cover
on telephone plus the back cover is written in chinese
yes i know chinese when i see it
one of those chinese assault rifles almost cost me an eye at hamburger hill
john listens trying to remain calm
i seem to be missing pages to
yes im sure
and what in blazes is this chapter eight
sigrid keeps cleaning
on telephone this chapter eight isnt mine
its about hormone replacement for women
do you think john k
butzin would write that
must be from another goddamn book
so what the hell you going to do about this
you sir are dealing with a decorated veteran a combat veteran of the united states army
john waits for an explanation
john looks again at his book in disbelief
then he remembers the camera
forces a faint smile
to camera minor details
all that truly matters is that john k
butzin is finally a published author
but catch sigrids expression
she is quiet
more than a little concerned at what she is hearing
henry and hannah at a table sharing coffee
eudora the waitress swings by with a refill hair purple as ever
hannah thumbs through her copy of gatsby looking interested
eudora notices the book
henry nods in agreement
eudora moves on
oh i needed this break
thank you henry
its just that im starting to feel the pressure you know
there is so much riding on this first book
dont be silly
sleeping on the moon will hit the bestseller list
youll be the toast of the literary world
and ill come over to beverly hills and deliver a pizza to you
beverly hills ah
parked on the street in front of hannahs apartment
henry and hannah this mutual admiration society stand by the car
hannah still has her copy of gatsby
what a dear sweet friend you are
hannah graces henry with another hug
another quick peck on the lips
but wait henry wants more
he kisses her back
more than a peck
too much more
hannah surprised pulls back her hand on his chest stop
gently no distractions
the writing comes first kay
henry nods reluctantly understood
one last hug from hannah before she heads for her front door smiling back over her shoulder at henry
henry watches her leave knowing that this was absolutely positively the best day of his life
the writing group meets
hannah henry john william alan and colette sit around the living room pages in front of them
writers at work sign on display
maureen trying not to be in the way goes from writer to writer carrying a large tray of veggies
whose turn is it to read
all eyes on henry
he shifts uncomfortably in his chair
someone else go
i dont have anything new ready tonight
concerned looks all around
its been weeks henry
still cant focus
dont be a pussy obert
complete the mission
writers block can be very serious john
john scoffs in disbelief
maureen offers william some veggies
he helps himself and checks out maureen as she moves on to alan
whats so hard bro
i mean youve got scott and christy
tell their story
thats the problem
i think the storys changing
lately im feeling something much deeper much richer
scott and christy um growing closer
the other group members appear puzzled
christys a beautiful wealthy author in beverly hills
how close can they get
christy has an epiphany
she she realizes her feelings run much deeper now for scott
henry does everything he can not to look at hannah
dont buy it
why muck it up
dont put em in the same foxhole
is this scott wanting to go beyond the friendship
theres no way christy would suggest it
what do you think hannah
hannah what do you think
all eyes go back to hannah
she does not want to answer
gee i i guess
i really never thought of them that way
hannah shakes her head
chooses her words carefully
its always been a friendship
henry takes a moment
you dont see anything possibly happening between them
id be uncomfortable with any changes in the relationship
all eyes on henry
ill try to have something on paper next time
complete the mission
writing group starts breaking up
william leans in close by hannah
lowered voice got a sec
william motions hannah over to the corner of the living room away from the others
she follows looking puzzled
henry watches with curiosity
william starts speaking to hannah in hushed tones trying not to let anyone else overhear the conversation
more hushed tones from william
hannah shakes her head
but if i loaned you money then i wouldnt have it
hey i just figured you know
you got that big advance
help out a fellow writer
im good for it hannah
its bad luck to loan money
ok then just give it to me
henry makes a point of moving in and standing directly by hannah staring william down
henry and hannah make eye contact
henry looks to her are we ok
hannah looks away
colette comes up next to william
how much do you need
william looks surprised
john sits in his comfortable chair
sigrid is nearby at the computer
john talks to the camera
this is a big moment
roaring lion has been posted on amazon
now all books
theyre ranked on amazon by sales
obviously everyone wants to be number one
they say a book is selling well on amazon if its in the top
time to run it up the flag pole
nervous sigrid takes a deep breath and taps away on the computer keys
she waits focused intently on the screen
reading slowly aloud
long silence as it all sinks in
john seems suddenly uncomfortable
sigrid types away on the computer keys again
reads off the screen
john discovers a new interest in the ceiling
hannah plops in her chair upscale shopping bags at her feet
maureen hovers in the background
how am i doing
looks like theres real interest in movie rights for sleeping on the moon
not excited in the least
matter of fact
but i dont dare say anything to the group
they find out ive got a movie deal i dont know
im sensing enough jealousy as it is you know
could be awkward if they found out
its a real whats that word
im in one
writers at work poster taped to the front door
full meeting of the writing group all crammed around the dining table
henry and hannah sit apart
a single bowl of pretzels has been placed before them
hannah reads from her typed pages
alan william colette and henry hang on her every word
john is half listening at best more interested in the magazine hes thumbing through
william reaches under the table and gently squeezes colettes hand
surprised she pulls her hand away
reading with feeling please come home michael
why would you want to marry me kyra
i barely graduated high school
michael i dont care about some silly college degree
youre the most intelligent person ive ever known
you are my shining star
then colette puts it back and squeezes williams hand
its his turn to be surprised
hannah slides off her new reading glasses waiting for someone to react
the room falls silent
alan steps in
group members look at the pages
at each other
no one steps forward
i value your feedback
were all in this together right
colette did the new scene work for you
colette seems thrown by the direct question
i mean youre being published
this is being published
but my editor wants rewrites
am i on track
alan jumps in to save his wife
of course you are hannah
you got the deal
you got the check
first one to be published
john clears his throat rather loudly what about me butthead
william ignores him
i think what im hearing from the group is
we all love it
nothing here to critique
you dont need us well its not that you dont need us but you know
alans voice trails off before he can dig himself any deeper
more silence as hannah wrestles with this unexpected reaction
finally looks to henry for help
what do you think henry
all eyes on henry
actually it is really good but there are a couple things little things id point out
for example holy douglas macarthur all eyes on john
finally holds up magazine to reveal that hes been reading variety
reading hollywood decides to go sleeping on the moon
first time scribe hannah rinaldi repped by brian barkley of soho scores six figure movie deal
ink is still fresh but barkley boasts keen interest by
john keeps reading
various reactions mostly muted around the table
can hannahs face turn any redder
members of the writing group struggle to deal with hannahs latest success alan and colette sit on their living room couch together wearing matching pajamas staring straight ahead like zombies
his tape recorder sits on the coffee table
alan reaches for it
she grabs it from his hand and throws it
william sits at the counter of restaurant drumming his fingers on the legal pad half heartedly trying to write
waitress pours him some more coffee trying to make eye contact with him
william ignores her
john sits in front of his computer screen but he cant concentrate
shuts down computer
flips on tv
another war movie
henry stares absent mindedly at his wall of rejection letters
hannah sits at her computer the only one actually working at the moment but she stops long enough to take a deep deep sigh
a lot weighs on her mind
alan arrives home
steps out of his lexus
happy go lucky
pauses in the driveway to record another idea
idea for novel
the amazing doctor eckleburg
an eye doctor turned crime fighter
alan sails through the front door
his smile disappears
william is plopped on the living room couch
shirt half unbuttoned
he freezes mid puff
sound of shower and colette singing off key echoes throughout the house
alan turns quiet as he makes the connection
just stopped by to
read some pages for colette
there are no pages on the coffee table in front of william
alan steps outside
acts like the terminator in his scanning of the area
man on a mission
what is he looking for
he finds it almost immediately zeroing in on colettes bench
alan marches over and grabs colettes prized framed photo of oprah
clutching it in his hand alan looks at oprahs smiling face then back towards the house
then he takes the frame and smashes it down on the ground as hard as he can
next he jumps up and down on the smashed frame multiple times
not satisfied alan bends down picks up the photo and rips it to shreds with his hands
that felt good
pool guy and gardener have witnessed the whole scene
what the hell
they exchange puzzled looks
henry talks to the camera
hannahs avoiding me
she doesnt respond to emails or voice messages
always an excuse
henry talks to the camera his concern unmistakable
things have definitely changed between us
i did get to go to her place for dinner last night
a spruced up henry sits down for dinner
hannah wasnt there
she was in new york with her publisher
but maureen and i had a lovely time
maureen passes henry more vegetables
colette sits on her private bench
note the new photo of oprah in a new frame
colette talks to the camera
i replaced the photo
i may be replacing other things around here soon
i was just using william
she holds up three more letters
speaking of rejection
three more letters saying nyet including one from david keller
i should have offered him a massage
how much more rejection can i take
colette stares at the letters focusing on remaining strong
reciting we keep going back stronger not weaker because we will not allow her voice cracks
fighting for composure rejection to beat us down colettes frustration is boiling into anger as she struggles to keep it under control
it will only strengthen our resolve
to be successful there is no other way
smoke rises from the fire pit burning whats left of the letters
colette sits cross legged devoting her full energy to chanting and beating her hands on a small drum
it isnt enough today
watch as colettes solemn chant dissolves into tears of frustration
xiroman places a comforting hand on her shoulder trying to calm colette down
sitting outside in the cheap lawn chairs with sigrid john addresses the camera
he cleans up pretty good
this is going to be a great day for john k
first official book signing
sigrid holds up a copy of roaring lion
the dog on the cover has had an image of a lion slapped over it
sigrid beams with pride
ready and raring to go
of course it would have been better to do this in an actual bookstore but hell theyre dropping faster than charlie at dak to
not to worry
since sigrid works at the hardware store theyre going to let her favorite author sign a few books there
more than a few books
many many books ja
ja my strudel
signs in front window announcing hammers ladders paint on sale
also a handwritten piece of paper taped to the window with masking tape announcing author signing
john sits at his card table in the corner
a stack of books sit piled in front of him
customers walk all around ignoring john completely
john tries to stay relaxed smiling and nodding at people not being too forceful
sigrid wearing her little red work vest and glasses stands off to the side beaming with pride
she hurries over to a cash register takes the telephone out of her surprised boss hand and jumps on the stores pa system blasting throughout the store
on pa system attention shoppers
famous author mr
bootzin signing new best seller
up front of store
also special today in plumbing department
two for one
all customers guaranteed will be satisfied
the pile of books seems untouched
still no takers
sigrid comes over to console him
seem to be shooting blanks today
john looks past sigrid
his face brightens
a smiling alan has arrived flanked by colette henry and hannah
hannah holds a cupcake
alan has a bottle of champagne and some plastic cups
but there is no touching no direct interaction between colette and alan
john stands up
the cavalrys arrived
look whos here
wouldnt miss your signing john
hannah presents john with the cupcake and leans in for a friendly peck on the cheek
colette aims her cell phone camera at john
john half smiles in response
henry reaches over and shakes his hand
wheres the bukowski wannabe
awkward silence as the group members exchange puzzled looks
william said hed meet us here
what a turd
never liked that punk anyway
maybe hes still at our house
maybe he is
maybe i should go see
maybe you should
whats that about
henry studies johns book
flips to the back cover
this is in chinese
all eyes on john
squirming he looks over to sigrid help me
she thinks for a second
john nods convincingly in agreement
except john and sigrid oh
sigrid sits alone on the couch as john floats in and out of camera humming to himself dancing like fred astaire
john is happy
sigrid seems more subdued
john addresses the camera
know what the hardware store manager said
he said today was their most successful book signing
a question is asked
this was their first book signing
well john k
butzin set the bar pretty high for the next writer let me tell ya
eleven books sold
sigrid clears her throat and flashes ten fingers in the air
oh thats right strudel
you borrowed one at the store to help prop open the side door
but there are now at least ten homes in california where folks have books by melville
and now butzin
its a humbling thought
john goes back to his routine
sigrid offers up a supportive smile but she doesnt seem quite as impressed
alan sits at the writers table
talks to the camera in whispered tones
ive made an important decision as group leader
ive decided to ask william to leave the group
now it has absolutely nothing to do with that incident at our house
it has nothing to do with the fact that im now sleeping in the guest room
but lets face it the kids a slacker
no contribution to the group
im sure hell be fine with it
william kicks his chair over
alan colette john henry and hannah sit calmly around the table
henry and hannah apart
theres no need to get so upset
i was going to quit anyway
leave this bunch of losers
william makes eye contact with colette you too
she looks away sorry
only fuels william more
he points to alan
you and your stupid recorder
and your stupid ideas
and your stupid character names
william clenches his fist and pretends its a microphone
name for character
bobby blow me
gimme a break
alan sits stone faced
william turns to john
joe over here with that piece of crap self published tripe
who are you kidding
flustered john starts to stand up
alan grabs johns arm pulls him back down
just ignore him
william continues on his rant with colette
colette colette my pet
news flash for you oprahs not calling unless she needs a massage
shes not on tv anymore
i know that
william turns his attention to henry
the great henry o
man you got the gift bro
but your head is up your ass over poor sweet successful hannah here
hannah and henry avoid looking at each other as william smiles at hannah
we could have been so hot together
im just as good a writer as you are but you sure look better in a skirt voice rising thats enough
i dont need any of you
i dont need any of your pointless pedestrian feedback
im a writer
youve got goddamn three pages
theyre a great three pages
you just dont appreciate my dedication
youre a pretend writer william
william is surprised that hannah speaks out
you act the part
you like the lifestyle
you hit on women
you quote bukowski
but bukowski did the work
each and every day he wrote
thats your problem william
you dont do the work
i dont do the work
man that sounds frickin hilarious coming from you
whens the last time you wrote anything
that hits a nerve
william and henry stare each other down
william flips off the group with his middle finger
mumbling grumbling under his breath he starts to leave
pauses at the writers at work sign
picks it up
not the sign
william rips it in two
and a second time for good measure
throwing the pieces on the ground
stomps out of the house slamming the front door
the group turns quiet for a long beat
everyone calming down
alan takes control again eyes still darting over to whats left of his beloved sign
lets move on
richard benedict is going to be doing a signing at wordsmith next week
alan looks directly at henry
who wants to go
because richard benedict is in the building doing a signing of his new novel the pineapple man
hannah henry alan and colette stand in line together waiting
colette is holding one copy of the book
hannah has one
henry has one
alan reaches inside his coat pocket for his recorder
snaps it on
idea for novel
jealous husband murders his tramp of a wife and buries her chopped up body in the back yard
colette pretends not to hear
line inches forward
alan cranes his neck to see whats happening
to himself mr
benedict i just want to thank you
youve inspired my writing no
i just think youre the greatest
colette puts a friendly hand on henrys shoulder
let me tell you something henry
henry looks to her expecting words of comfort
one day ill have a signing like this
colette looks around already imagining the event
john is bent over his printer jiggling the front end trying to open it
tapping it on the side
not going to see richard whatever his name is
butzin author doesnt need to stand in line anymore
this soon to be best selling writer is spending every minute every dollar on promoting roaring lion
try as he might john cant open up his printer
effortlessly opens up the printer
takes the cartridge from john
snaps it in
shuts the lid
john grunts his thanks
strudel check my sales ranking again
sigrid steps to the computer and taps a couple keys
stares at the screen
reading out loud
not quite the hoped for response
turns quiet inside the mobile home
john clears his throat
look how far ive moved up already
sigrid types again
reads off the screen
forget about john for the moment
watch sigrid as her eyes dart around from the screen to john in the chair out the window
this is the moment
sigrid gets it now john k
butzin is not the author he pretends to be
very quiet in the mobile home
the author s sits at the signing table obliging but not outgoing grunting hello to people and smiling somewhat for photos as he signs books
he is not here by choice today
the young clerk hovers nearby assisting with books and trying to keep the line moving
henry is first followed by alan and colette then hannah
henry clutches his copy
good luck trying to rip it from his hands
the four get nearer to benedict
hes older than i thought
ive never seen him before
to himself pleasure to meet you
honor to meet you
he she they is my favorite novel
closer they get to the table
richard signs away
henry seems transfixed by him
now its his turn to have his book signed
the moment has arrived
henry stands directly in front of richard benedict
henry seems nervous
too nervous to speak
richard looks up and for the slightest milli second their eyes meet
at that exact moment richards cell phone goes off
on phone what
henry stands there unable to move staring at richard while he speaks on the phone
to henry sir
alan nudges henry
we need to keep the line moving
he takes henrys copy of the novel and slides it over to benedict
benedict scribbles his name quickly and slides it back with no eye contact yelling on the phone
on phone absolutely not
ill sue that bastard first
alan grabs the book and gives it back to henry nudging him again
we need to move henry
alan and colette slide their book over to richard
richard looks up at her for a split second and decides to ignore her
another scribbled signature as he remains on the phone
colette takes the book trying not to look hurt
alan grabs henry and they leave the area
hannah is next up
she puts her book down on the table
on phone damn it
that simply wont richard glances up
sees hannah standing there
he stops in mid sentence
richard hangs up the phone
the two start chatting
camera goes over to the shell shocked henry still clutching his book watching as hannah and richard carry on
henry is so disconcerted by what he sees that he fails to notice eudora still with purple hair and matching glasses the very next person in line behind hannah waving
after the signing
alan and colette walk ahead
henry and hannah follow
colette henry and hannah each carry book bags
so what did he say
you know the guy who just held up the line for five minutes talking to you
over his shoulder ten
it was closer to ten minutes
i dont know
we just talked
he sure liked you
we just talked henry
i mentioned my book
he started asking about it
writer to writer
no big deal
no big deal
talking to richard benedict
no big deal
colette keeps walking
biting her lip
you gave him your phone number
look a guy like that reads more books in a week than i ever have
why would he bother call just then hannahs iphone goes off
the other three stop in their tracks
on telephone hello
henry inches closer to hannah forcing hannah to move back creating an uneasy dance between the two
she turns her back on henry
on telephone coffee
i dont know richard
i really appreciate the invitation but she listens
her face is anguished
finally this isnt a good time
call me later
ill think about it
hannah turns off her phone
alan colette henry stand there gaping jaws wide open
this isnt fair
this just isnt fair
first you get an agent
then you sell your book
then the big movie deal
this isnt fair
and now richard benedict wants to have coffee with you
all this is happening to you
and only you
isnt there anything i dont know some kind of cosmic creative crumb for the rest of us to nibble on
i dont like what youre suggesting colette
you know how hard i work
how devoted i am
and i have been totally supportive of your writing
ive encouraged you all along
you wouldnt introduce me to your agent
brian didnt want to meet you
hannah has earned her success
butt out mr
hannah is a writer
she devotes herself one hundred percent to writing
not one hundred percent to sleeping with writers
henry steps in
why dont you two just go on ahead
its not fair that she be the only one
colette marches off in a huff alan in pursuit
she looks over her shoulder shouting back at hannah
henry and hannah sit on opposite ends of the bench
hannah looks distraught lost in thought simmering
henry knows to keep his distance
colette looks frazzled
she finally notices the camera
im a shit for exploding at hannah arent i
runs her hands through her hair
poor sweet superstitious everybody loves hannah
starts massaging forehead trying to reduce stress
if she can succeed so can i
we were born to succeed not to fail
hears a question o
who said that
i dont know
somebody with an agent
now come the deep breaths
more stress control
i cant accomplish anything without an agent
they wont come to me
ill go to them
ill make it happen
hannah and henry remain on the bench
hannah takes a breath and finally breaks her silence
your writers block
its because your focus is always on everything else
henry isnt about to argue
listen to me henry obert
your writing must come first
take this passion you have
put it on the page
forget everything else
all youre doing is wasting
hannah continues the lecture speaking from the heart
but i know whats really happening here
hannahs telling me she has every intention of talking to richard benedict
she has every intention of seeing him
on the discount table up by the cash register lies a pile of roaring lion books under another handmade sign off
sigrid stares at the pile of unwanted books in quiet contemplation
sigrid glances up
her boss watches her from the cash register with a certain longing
sigrid returns the smile
back to business
sigrid pulls a wad of dollar bills from her hip pocket
then picks up johns books one by one
john looks like the proverbial kid in a candy store
in total shock as he clutches a handful of twenties
all the books sold at the hardware store
john claps his hands together
there is a certain spring in his feet
didnt i tell you strudel
write it and they will read
john cant contain his enthusiasm as he paces the mobile home his mind racing
sigrid is more composed
get some more copies down there
maybe do another signing
time for a real tour
call a few bookstores
let em know john k
butzin is coming
lock and load
and hes off leaving the frame already planning his big adventure leaving sigrid alone
facing the camera she nods slightly
then offers us a small wave
the small reception area for the lois piper agency
phones constantly chirping
the young male assistant behind the counter obviously paid to be patient points to the framed sign on the counter in large letters no unsolicited manuscripts will be accepted
colette and dr
xiroman will not be deterred
she holds a thick manila envelope
i have to see ms
we just need five minutes
minutes of her time
the assistant points back to the sign
can you just please stick your head in her office tell her that colette mooney is here
i know shes busy but shell certainly want to see my manuscript
the assistant ignores her
flustered im a graduate of mills college
behind them coming from the inner office we hear lois piper if i have to read one more vampire story i swear ill drive a stake through my own goddamn
manuscript comes flying out of her office
loose pages splatter everywhere in the main office
lois piper quickly follows
needs a drink
harry potter knock offs
people writing about their dogs
just shoot me now
it is at that moment when lois first notices the camera
caught off guard
what the hell
colette cranes her neck over the assistant
lois turns her attention to colette
who are you
then magically lois changes
a big smile replaces the scowl
she marches towards colette who is clearly not expecting a warm reception
lois walks right past colette and instead warmly shakes hands with dr
i cant believe youre here
how lovely to see you again
xiroman nods his head in greeting
just in the neighborhood
please come in for a minute
another glance at the camera
then taking dr
xiroman by the elbow lois guides him back towards her office completely snubbing a bewildered colette
my family talks about you all the time
you were so helpful to my sister
shes doing much better
colette stands there helplessly watching her future walk away
the assistant points in their direction get in there
lois plops down behind her desk
stacks of manuscripts cover her desk
xiroman sits quietly in one chair
colette sits next to him
sighing distraught look at my desk dr
look at all this
do you know what it is
its all crap
i hate my job
i hate my life
xiroman nods i understand
know what i feel like doing
she looks at the camera
come in closer
i want you to get this
satisfied lois takes her free hand and shoves all the manuscripts off her desk sending them flying on the floor
colette looks aghast
lois seems free at last
that was so
i havent felt this good since that night in paris with salman rushdie
lois growls like a tiger at the memory
i envy you dr
look at your life
you helped my sister
youve helped so many people
you have such a positive message to share
the camera picks up on lois as the light goes on the wheels start turning in her head
wait a minute
wait a minute
wait a minute
a positive message to share
xiroman you should write a book
this could be a whole series
your own blog
xiroman has no reaction
colette cant believe what she is hearing
getting from xiro to one by doctor xiroman
oh i like that
but in fact as long as youre here today why dont we just get you under contract
i know just who to call in new york
what about me
lois shoots her a look what about you
colette backs down not wanting to spoil the moment
lois yells for her assistant
finally a slight smile crosses dr
xiroman beams as he signs the standard agency contract so quickly drawn up for him
lois and her assistant appear equally excited
colette fidgets off to the side
then lois hands her the pen and points her towards the contract
actually ill be listed as junior author
its not exactly what i wanted but at least now i finally have an agent
and a book deal
lois and the assistant wave goodbye as colette and dr
my novel will have to wait a while longer
henry delivers another pizza
pockets the money as he walks back to his car whistling
checks his delivery list
stares at the next address in sudden disbelief
henry stands in the doorway glumly clutching the pizza box
finally rings doorbell
followed by loud laughter
door swings open
richard stands there wearing only his jeans
his hair is a mess
youre late pizza boy
richard finally notices the camera
what the overlapping theyre with me
your total comes to nineteen dollars and sixty five cents
richard pulls a crumpled twenty from his jean pocket
he hands it to henry
then reconsiders calling inside
babe i need a single
got a dollar for pizza boy
richard gives a last glance to the camera
hes got better things to do
off he goes
hannah comes to the door wearing richards shirt and little else carrying a single dollar bill
here you her words freeze up as she recognizes henry
henry and hannah lock eyes for a long beat
this is the moment
reality smacks him in the face
hannah starts to hand henry the money
he puts his hands up no thanks
hannah doesnt press
henry cant hold back any longer
the writing comes first
hes making me a better writer
i bet he is
quietly seething henry nods towards the camera
how much better are you hannah
who wrote slaughterhouse five
this could be quite educational
how about native son
why isnt it enough that im your friend
lord of the flies
do you know any author
harry potter you must know harry potter
why isnt it enough that i believe in your writing
anything published in the english language
that i believe in you
you didnt read gatsby did you
never even opened it i bet
im not she hesitates
not for long
im not the one delivering pizzas for a living
score one for hannah
im not the one wasting my talent
youve read all those books sure but my book is being published
henry has no comeback
hannah stares him down
the dollar bill drops from her hand on to the ground
she retreats back inside the house firmly closing the front door leaving henry alone
only then do we notice the number of the house
weve never seen henry like this
he rips down all his richard benedict photos from the wall
collects all his benedict books
stuffs everything in a cardboard box
next he turns his attention to all the rejection letters on the wall
lot of rejection
gives them a long look
then he snaps up the photo of hannah from near his computer
he takes the photo and tacks it dead center in the middle of all his rejection letters
henry stares at the photo oblivious to the camera consumed by hannahs radiant smile
his latest and most painful rejection
henry understands what must be done
he goes over to his desk
sits down at his laptop
one last glance over at hannahs photo as he turns the computer on
he contemplates for a second
then begins typing
sigrids wall of america has been taken down
a few nail holes and tape marks are all that remain except for the single photo of john still hanging in the center
back to the two lawn chairs with one prime difference
sigrids chair is empty
john sits by himself
this is a softer more reflective john talking to the camera
well strudel shipped out
a side glance to the empty chair
oh she wanted to stay but
i didnt have time for a relationship
not with my book selling like it is
she well she became collateral damage
hated to end it
what a dame
she had the smarts of my first wife
the body of my second wife
thank god she wasnt anything like my third wife
i did the right thing
good acting john
he looks back to the empty chair
cant avoid reaching over and giving the arm rest a little love tap
john packs copies of his book ever so carefully into an old standard issue military duffel bag
what matters now is that the roaring lion book tour is about to begin
cant wait to hit the road and meet the good people of this nation
good american people
john gazes over at his photo on the wall
meeting of the writing group
not yet started
john alan and hannah sit around the table
no refreshments being served
no small talk
everyone is quiet
hannah looks fantastic
fidgets in her chair
stares at her new kindle
front door opens and closes
man on a mission
carries a satchel
sorry im late
john grunts something
hannah remains quiet
avoids eye contact with henry
henry reaches into his satchel and pulls out stapled typed pages
hands one to each of the three group members
puts another down where colette will sit
wutch you got here obert
im ready to read
way to go henry
even hannah looks surprised
she and alan thumb through their copies
john sniffs at the front page
henry slides in across from hannah
front door opens again
colette arrives with dr
xiroman in tow
the others exchange puzzled glances
whats he doing here
ive invited doctor xiroman to join our writing group
you must be joking colette
i am not joking
and as a matter of fact ill have all of you know that the doctor and i are soon to be published authors
weve signed with the lois piper agency
colette stands there waiting for the applause and congratulations but all she receives is stunned silence
you cant do this
with william gone we have an opening
we all have to agree on new members
i dont care about your silly rules
i am the leader of the group oh please
voice rising i am the leader of the group
xiroman is my co author and he is joining the group
he is not
is n hannah cant take it any longer
she throws up her hands
yelling the room turns quiet
all eyes on hannah
she composes herself
surprise all around
hannah avoids looking at henry
richard is going to mentor me
todays the nd
two plus two equals four and we all know fours
her voice trails off
why bother explaining
just do it
anyway im quitting
she said it
hannah looks so relieved
indignant colette stares her up and down
points to dr
well in this case one plus one equals one very successful writing team
i cant believe you hannah
youre doing this just to upstage our news about landing an agent
no this is what its all about
the spotlight always has to be on little miss sunshine
her book deal
her movie deal
john shoots to his feet
news flash for you all
butzin is also saying sayonara
heading off on my international book tour
beat im done with you pussies
john snatches up his folder and marches out of the house
colette starts to sit down at the table motions for xiroman to join her
final straw for alan
stares directly at colette
colette cant believe what shes hearing
as the leader of this writing group ive determined your actions are contrary to our stated purpose
you cant kick me out
i live here
alan considers his options
then go to your room
points to xiroman
and take him with you
wont be the first guy
alan means business
colette stands up straight
gathers up her materials
well certainly have plenty to discuss in therapy
go by yourself
just like always alan finishes first
she grabs dr
im looking forward to working with a real doctor
on our new book
colette and dr
frustrated alan takes a deep breath
reaches inside his coat pocket for his recorder
turns it on
idea for novel
thinks for a second
turns off the recorder
slides it across the table to henry
maybe you can use some of my ideas in your novel
alan flashes a thumbs up sign to henry and to hannah
he starts to leave but remembers the camera
to camera this was supposed to be a reality series
thats off his chest
alan leaves henry and hannah alone at the table
he stands up
calmly puts his typed pages back in his satchel
leaves alans recorder on the table walks away without looking back
dont waste your breath
hannahs book release party
her professional photo adorns a poster announcing the publication of sleeping on the moon
boy hannah looks terrific in that photo
richard hovers around the makeshift bar drink in hand
maureen looking radiant accepts the congratulations of well wishers
table prominently centered has piles of hannahs novel waiting to be signed
hannah talks to the camera looking especially radiant
this is her day and she is more than ready for her close up
totally different in wardrobe and appearance
exciting isnt it
im so nervous
i dont know half these people
most of them are richards friends
hannah waves to richard
he waves back
hannah glances around the room as if looking for someone in particular
nobodys showed up from my old writing group
probably shouldnt be surprised
havent really heard from anyone in months
she is asked a question
you keep asking me that
still cant think of one
hannah sits behind the table signing books
maureen stands behind her helping to orchestrate the line of people
hannah acts very gracious
signing a book smiling and chatting up the guests
she seems at ease
everything is going her way
she looks past the line
her eyes light up and she jumps to her feet
oh my god
hannah bolts from the table cuts through the line and finds henry standing alone
thank you so much for coming
hannah throws her arms around henry giving him a long heartfelt hug almost smothering the poor guy not that he complains
she lets go and gives henry a friendly once over
youre the only one from the group who showed up
still awkward for them to be around each other
i cant believe you remembered my signing
well pretty hard to miss that article about you in people magazine
just wanted to say hi
maureen comes up behind hannah
beams at henry and waves
to hannah hannah come back
your public awaits
they need you
cant keep her waiting
a flight attendant
buying the obvious lie a flight attendant
guess you cant stay
hannah runs back to the signing table pulls out a book and scribbles something inside
she brings the book back over to henry
this is for you
henry accepts the book
hannah gives him another long hug
do you want to say hello to richard
it will take just a minute
dear sweet hannah
just say hi
henry tries to back away
hannah leans forward grabs his hand and tugs him in the other direction
ive really got to
youll then bam henry not looking where hes going slams into richard accidentally spilling richards drink all over the author
horrified looks all around
outside the bookstore henry stands on the sidewalk talking to the camera as he clutches hannahs book
well i did it
i showed up to hannahs signing
i congratulated her
i supported her writer to writer
and i finally got introduced to richard benedict formally
henry opens up his copy of hannahs novel
he turns quiet obviously moved
he holds the book up for the camera to see
hannah dedicated her novel to me
just like she promised
right beneath the printed dedication for henry obert hannah has written for henry my forever friend xoxoxo hannah
henry studies the book for a second
snaps it shut
literary agent david keller being interviewed for the camera in his office
stacks of manuscripts on his desk
david pulls one out
this is why i love la
this guy delivers a pizza to my house one night
then the very next week my wife has someone come in and clean the carpets
small world isnt it
so we get talking
he tells me his names henry
hes a writer
hes just finished a manuscript
offers us a discount on the carpets if ill read ten pages
i like that thinking
so i read ten pages
i want to read ten more
before i know it ive read the entire book
just loved it
and that ending
david thumbs through the manuscript
the washed up impotent novelist getting gunned down by scott the jealous underemployed pizza delivery man
this kid nailed it
its on the page know what i mean
so i intend to sign mr
henry obert and get pizza to go out there
i predict a best seller
probably a movie too
ill call him with the good news
or maybe ill just order a pizza
henry taking down the rejection letters from his walls and packing them in a cardboard box
david keller did call me
one week later he sold pizza to go to a new york publisher
they decided to rename it a slice of la
i did it
i sold my novel
henry puts the last of the rejection letters away
finally he picks up a framed photo
insert shows the six members of the writing group from happier times the photo snapped in the restaurant
full of hope and promise
i miss the tuesday night group
they made me a better writer
they taught me how to handle rejection
henry lingers on the photo before packing it away as well
henry sits at a booth alone a new copy of gatsby in his hands
he talks to the camera
cup of coffee in front of him
hannah was right
the writing must always come first
everything else waits
thats what i did finally
finished my novel
now im open
ready for whatever waitress stops by the table refilling henrys cup
then setting the pot on the table she reaches over and snatches the copy of gatsby
surprised henry glances up
its her again
that young waitress with purple streaks in her hair and matching purple glasses thumbs through the book
henry finally checks out her name tag eudora
clutching the book eudora recites from memory gatsby believed in the green light the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us
it eluded us then but thats no matter surprised tomorrow we will run faster stretch out our arms further
henry is amazed
you know fitzgerald
he died here you know
i go by there sometimes
the place on hayworth
is that weird
that i do that
not at all
eudora smiles glad for the positive reinforcement
because you know i dont want people to think im weird
of course not
do you write
kinda sort of
but im thinking of joining a writing group
henry bites his tongue
eudora nods towards the camera
so whats this
some kind of reality show or something
the two continue their idle chatter
caption reads phoenix arizona
after a very successful book tour john k
butzin heard the grand canyon state calling
this is home now
costumed children knock on the door while holding their trick or treat bags
real god fearing americans live here
not those la la pussies
john opens the front door
trick or treat
john responds by dropping a book in the first bag
look at this treat you get
a copy of roaring lion by john k
the children are dumbfounded
john moves on to the next child
william is back at the counter looking as scruffy as ever
off to the side stands a geeky kid gripping a flip phone aimed directly at william
william talks to our camera
you missed me
it wasnt as interesting once i left right
the kid doesnt move
i knew the group wouldnt last without me
he nods towards his companion
its my new project
a reality tv show based on my life
women i meet
thoughts that pop into my head
kid follows me all around
actually i got the idea from you guys
same concept just better characters
a question is asked
its p p a
pasadena public access
oh people watch
were on right after that pet psychic
a waitresss hand reaches in and refills williams coffee cup
he likes what he sees
he looks over to geeky kid
get a close up on her
nice and tight
william will never change
and hey kid
lend me five bucks
i want to leave an extra special tip
two posters on easel in the hallway
first poster announcing after i sent colette packing i was ready for a new chapter in my life
puppet making meets in room and quilting is in room
writing is in room
and dog obedience is out in the courtyard but we already know that the loud sound of barking dogs and people yelling sit is heard in the background
second poster is a new version of quiet please writers at i found it teaching adult ed
writing is the class
helping writers to see
inspired by my new self published e book of the same title
students scattered around the classroom
ethnic and demographic mix
the dogs continue barking outside
alan stands in front of the class
excited he claps his hands once
youve got ten seconds
write down the name of your character
first name that pops into mind
tell me your character
students think for a second
start scribbling a name
pass your names up front here
lets see what you came up with
students hand their papers forward
alan starts collecting them
the right name is so important for your character
what do we have
he looks at the first piece of paper
heres one i havent heard
heywood ja jabloom
thats not it
alan tries again
or is it jablom
laughter and guffaws from the students
alan looks puzzled
whats so funny
am i missing something
the students continue to laugh
catch the for sale sign posted on the front lawn
colette engages in intense meditation on her bench
the garden around her is now dead
xiroman and i wrote our book
it actually did fairly well
title in large letters getting from xiro to one by dr
xiroman in equally large letters
at the bottom of the book in very tiny letters reads with colette mooney
phil turned us down
but we had a lovely time on anderson
insert photo of smiling anderson cooper
anderson actually wanted us back but dr
xiroman and lois piper started dating
they eloped to vegas last month
off on a world cruise
insert photo of dr
xiroman and lois being married in vegas by elvis
so in less than a year ive lost my husband my co author and my agent
but i still have nyet not yet
and i will find an agent to sell my novel
i bought an ad in the trades
colette reaches for her reading glasses and shares the ad copy with us reading aloud the magic fingers that just typed the publishing worlds next best selling novel are now
waiting to provide free massage to interested literary agents
no junior agents please
looking quite pleased with herself colette lets the copy fall away
its how i met my last husband
i think it can work again
after all i am a graduate of her iphone starts playing music signaling a phone call
colette smiles in knowing satisfaction publication is just a touch away the movie crew on location scurries about trying to line up their next shot
welcome to sleeping on the moon the movie
its so exciting
hannah looking good sits in a chair a book on her lap
she is talking to the camera
crew in the background
my book ended up on the best sellers list
stopping at number
she crinkles her nose in obvious disappointment
then richard left me
im sure the two were connected
such an ego
but guess what
ive gone back to school
to underscore the point she holds up a the book its the great gatsby
look what im reading for class
isnt that pretty you know what do they call it
whats that word
she hears an answer
but im going to get my degree
then ill be smart
short beat you know how you kept asking me that question
whos my favorite writer
turns out i do have one
hes become a great writer
a published author
i knew him when
she likes her answer
but then hesitates
probably shouldnt tell him i said that kay
keep it between us
well my novel finally came out
seems to be doing ok
henry looks more confident
the frog has become the prince
he glances back at the building
you know fitzgerald said that all good writing is swimming under water and holding your breath
he was right
but after all ive been through i think im finally ready to exhale
he looks at his watch
shoppers coming in and out of the store
poster in front window announces book signing for henry obert author of slice of la
right next to banner announcing going out of business
and next to the banner a young man leans up against the wall waiting passing time reading his kindle
we jump to the woman clutching four copies of henrys novel
wait a minute we recognize those trendy glasses
its eudora a rather pregnant eudora
laughing yes im totally busted
im buying four copies of a slice of la
one for each member of my writing group
also because i think henry wayne obert is the greatest new writer of the decade
eudora is having way too much fun
so hes my husband
but i still think the kid can write
henry sits at the table in the bookstore graciously and happily signing copies of his book for the short line of people waiting
this is his moment the one that brought him all the way from illinois
he has arrived
as a person
as a writer
henry looks up
eudora is nestled comfortably in a nearby leather chair reading away
she looks up
they make eye contact
her smile is all the encouragement henry needs
all that he will ever need
he reaches for the next book to sign
