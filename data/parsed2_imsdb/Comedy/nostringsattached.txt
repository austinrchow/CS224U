yeah youre right
a summer camp in northern michigan
its a dance
an over enthusiastic counselor with a massive boombox stereo
coolios fantastic voyage blasts
about ten thirteen year old boys are lined up along the side
hair down to their ears and parted in the middle little versions of kurt cobain or jord catalano
they are staring at a group of dancing girls in the middle is katie the blonde who grew boobs before anyone else
and every time she moves she bounces
the boys watch her serious concentrating
they need to remember this for later
katie continues to bounce one boy suddenly looks down scared
it does other stuff
but theres a boy on the edge of the group a sweet
face and you wouldnt be surprised to find but hes jewish a year old adam kurtzman
hes the only boy not looking at katie
instead hes staring off in another direction
on the other side of the dance floor next to an enormously fat kid theres emma
shes an awkward
wearing borrowed clothes a skirt thats a little too long a top that she cant fill out
shes taller than any of the boys
but theres something in her eyes like shes laughing at everything
she makes eye contact with adam she squints
he takes a deep breath
she squints some more
he walks over
a long pause
theyre not looking at each other
then do you want to freak
tlcs no scrubs
emma and adam are freaking awkwardly emma is too tall and adam is holding on too tight and just bouncing up and down
you freak good
singing along with the song no i dont want no scrubs
i dont get it
she doesnt want a scrub because hes hanging out of his
best friends ride trying to holler at her
katie in another part of the dance floor is in the middle of a big freak sandwich
emma scowls at her looks at adam

but i feel like ive known you
my whole life
emma and adam awkwardly stand against the wall near the dumpster
there are couples on either side
of them making out

thats why i had to go to carp
the couple making out next to them rolls over
emma pushes them back over

teething and ive just always associated it with
pain in my gums
so do you do this stuff all the
s okay if you do i might
call you a ho but its okay
but i dont have a problem with it
the affairs of the
the fleeting passions of a drunken night
see it were all just these big dumb
who for the most
part just want to have sex with each other
so maybe we should stop beating ourselves up for what we feel and just make sweet bone
you make a c ompelling argument
and also its somewhat improbable but i like you

um i think i
ii go with you

emma with a hoodie over her scrubs comes in the back
someone told me recently that i look like richard nixon when i gum
adam does a little imitation of what that looks
emma smiles kind of embarrassed
she looks over and sees alv n and vanessa there too laughing
and it suddenly became clear why none of my girlfriends ever wanted to have sex with me
i thought it was just because my dick was too big and it scared them but apparently thats not the problem
actually ive heard its like acupuncture youre on your back the whole time and you dont even feel it go in
thats what my ex girlfriend told me before she started dating my father
vanessa and alvin laugh vanessa covers her head with her hand
actually theyre getting married
so mothers day just keeps getting better and better

call me and expect me to just come running which i did i know but i cant just jump back in i cant just start over all of a sudden
it doesnt work that way
i get i
they look at each other at a loss

but im in love with you
i want to write it on myforehead t want to buy a t shirt thats says i love
adam kurtzman and wear it around all day long
what do you want me to do

i dont think i can doit again
but we should still you know see come on
we dont have to break up we never even started
youre going to be so great

a guy comes
out of the club and calls

adamissitting on the curb outside the club
alvin is sitting down next to him
is everyone gone
vanessa went home to walk the dog
we have a dog now
she named it freckle
i dont know what to do about that
i might kill it
i dont know yet
only time will tell
a beat hey lets pretend im a good dad
and you tell me what the hells wrong with you and then i take you
im completely in love with someone and im brainstorming ways that i can never see her again without ruining my life
you get so screwed up
i did it
im just like you im going to fuck it all up
like you gave up on mom
a beat when we first had you we hadnt slept in days we were just shoving food in our mouths over the sink whenever we could
and finally i got it together enough to get
some take out from one of the restaurants we used to like
and i set it all out on the table and the second we sat down i think it was the first bite i took you started crying
and your horn and i looked at each other and just uncontrollably laughing
were on the floor we cant breathe
that kind of laughing
im pretty sure that was the best of moment of my life
if you rre not counting anything with a blowjob
so whyd you start dicking around
whyd you leave her
i dont know
i think the
simplest answer is im a jerk
other answer is because at some point we forgot how to make each other laugh
and if that sounds like a bullshit answer youre probably right
but if it sounds really deep then that s good too
just fyi the first time i cheated
your mom i
was on a lot of blow
if youre married and you
do blow try to avoid being around women who wantto fuck
even fat women
blow is blind adam blow is blind
youre an asshole
but youre not
dont tell me what to do
a beat smiles
