written by seth macfarlane alec sulkin wellesley wild as the universal logo completes itself we begin to slowly push in on the east coast of the united states
the camera glides down through the atmosphere through the clouds closer and closer until we begin to see large patches of snow covering the upper coastline
we continue to push in until we arrive at one small suburban neighborhood
over the push in we hear the following narration delivered by patrick stewart
it has been said that magic vanished from our world a long time ago
and that humanity can no longer fulfill its desires through the power of wishes
to those who have lost the wondrous vision of childhood eyes submitted here is the story of a little boy and a magical christmas wish that changed his life forever
it began in in a town just outside boston
we see a group of kids laughing and tossing snowballs at each other in the street
it was christmas eve and all the children were in high spirits
that special time of year when boston children gather together and beat up the jewish kids
another little kid walks out of his house with a sled and starts walking up the street
one of the snowball throwing kids points at the sled kid
its jesus birthday tomorrow
you know what im gonna get him
my fist in your fuckin face
why would jesus want that
the kids all chase greenbaum up the street and tackle him
another boy john bennett about years old shy and innocent looking approaches the melee
but there was one child who wasnt in such good spirits
little john bennett
that one boy in every neighborhood who just has a tough time making friends
hey guys can i play
the kids all look at him
get outta here
get outta here bennett
get lost bennett
the jewish kid his face bloodied looks angrily at john
yeah bennett get outta here
the kids go back to beating up greenbaum as john sadly walks back toward his house
john longed with all his heart for that one true friend that he could call his own
and he knew that if he ever found that friend he would never let him go
john sadly sits by his window with his chin in his hands looking outside
johns pov we see the other kids all playing in the snow building snowmen throwing snowballs etc
at one point a black kid in a wheelchair wheels up
the other kids welcome him with open arms and he immediately joins in the fun
well as it does every year christmas morning finally came
all the children were opening their gifts with holiday glee
a little girl opens a present as her parents look on smiling
inside is a my little pony
she smiles with delight
a little boy opens a present as his parents look on smiling
inside is a g
the boy is overjoyed
another little boy opens a present as his parents look on smiling
inside is a darth vader head action figure case
the boy opens it up revealing that its full of star wars action figures
the boy jumps around ecstatically
and for little john bennett christmas day brought a very special new arrival
john sits amidst unwrapped gifts
we see him opening a present
inside is a plush adorable looking teddy bear
the boy holds it with delight
his mom and dad hug him
i guess santa paid attention to how good you were this year huh
merry christmas john
john hugs the teddy bear
it makes a cutesy high pitched i wuv you sound
john gasps with delight
john giggles happily squeezing the bear to make it talk as his mom and dad exchange a smile
im gonna name you teddy
john sits on the floor watching the film flash gordon on tv
he eats twizzlers with ted sitting next to him
occasionally he gives ted a bite
john became instantly attached to teddy
there was something about that bear that made him feel as if he finally had a friend with whom he could share his deepest secrets
can i tell you something nobody knows
teddy looks back at him expressionless
last week my mom and dad took me to the park for a picnic
and they have this duck pond there and
when nobody was looking i pooped in my hand and threw it at a duck
was that mean
he squeezes ted who once again makes the i wuv you sound
i love you too teddy
john gets into bed with the teddy bear and snuggles with it
i wish you could really talk to me
because then we could be best friends forever and ever
john drifts off to sleep
the camera moves toward the window and drifts outside
it pulls back from the house slowly
now if theres one thing you can be sure of
its that nothing is more powerful than a young boys wish
except an apache helicopter
an apache helicopter has machine guns and missiles
it is an unbelievably impressive complement of weaponry
an absolute death machine
well as it turned out john picked the perfect night to make a wish
the camera pivots around to face the sky
we see the snow falling from moonlit clouds
at the center of the clouds there is a small patch of open air through which we can see stars
suddenly a shooting star whizzes by through the opening
slowly push in on the teddy bears face as john lies sleeping next to it
the house and yard are covered with snow
john slowly opens his eyes
he turns over to face teddy but we see that teddy is no longer next to him
john bolts upright and looks around frantically
beat a bit more concerned teddy
john looks under the covers but the bear is not there
he jumps out of bed and looks around the beds perimeter assuming that teddy must have fallen off during the night
finally he checks underneath the bed
angle from underneath the bed we see john looking around
john sits up again and freezes looking right into the camera wide eyed
angle on johns p
we see the face of teddy staring right at him
teddy blinks once
john yelps and stumbles back falling over
he stares at teddy breathing heavily
did you just talk
youre my best friend john
dont look so surprised
youre the one who wished for it arent you
i did wish for it
well here i am
we get to be best friends
forever and ever
sounds good to me
a huge grin spreads across johns face
he gets up runs to teddy and hugs him
john was just about the happiest boy in the world
and he couldnt wait to tell everyone the good news
johns dad sits at the breakfast table reading the paper as johns mom prepares eggs and bacon putting it on their plates
well i think we had a wonderful christmas this year
one of the best
and i particularly enjoyed the gift you gave me last night
john runs into the kitchen
my teddy bears alive
johns mom and dad look at each other and smile
well thats exciting
no mom hes alive
teddy walks in and stands next to john
merry christmas everybody
johns dad scrambles to his feet knocking plates off the table
johns mom screams
lets all be best friends
oh my god
john get away from that thing
come over here right now
john reluctantly walks over to his dad who grabs him and protectively pulls him aside
helen get my gun
is it a hugging gun
helen get my gun and call the police
im sorry mr
i didnt mean to scare anybody
i just wanted john and i to be friends
i made a wish last night that teddy was alive and my wish came true
my god steve
its a miracle
a christmas miracle
they stare at teddy for a beat
well it wasnt long before the story of johns little miracle was sweeping the nation
we see an s newscaster behind the news desk
a graphic of the bear is over his left shoulder

scientists are stumped as to how

look what jesus did
look what jesus did
a male japanese newscaster and female japanese newscaster sit behind the desk
between them at the top of the screen is a picture of the bear
the male newscaster turns sharply to her
he strikes her for an unclear reason
she buries her head in her hands in shame
before long teddy had become a huge celebrity in his own right
we see real footage of the tonight show from the s with johnny carson talking to teddy who is sitting in the guest chair if appropriate footage is accessible will
include teddy walking out on stage shaking hands with johnny and sitting down
john and teddy are in bed under the covers with a flashlight
but through all the fame teddy never forgot his very best friend john
the thunder cant get us right
were thunder buddies
and the thunder knows it
were totally safe
angle under the covers we now see them
do you promise well always be together
another thunder clap
thunder buddies for life
thunder buddies for life
they hug as we pull back slowly dissolving through the covers
and that was a promise that neither one of them ever forgot
over the following we continue to pull back from the room to the outside of the moonlit house
so where are john and teddy today
well let me put it this way no matter how big a splash you make in this world whether youre corey feldman frankie muniz justin bieber or a talking teddy
bear eventually nobody gives a shit

john turns around and grabs her
they scuffle playfully and then kiss
we angle on ted who stands on a little stepladder hammering a home sweet home picture into the wall
he steps back but realizes he has nailed his hand to the wall
he tugs slips and the ladder falls
ted hangs there like an idiot
john lori and ted sit on the couch
all three sit with their legs crossed faux pretentiously raising glasses of jorian hill syrah to camera in identical poses the wine bottle on the table in front of them

ted sits on the sofa and for the first time we see ted in his present day form he is ratty patched up and worn looking
he has a couple stains some small spots of exposed stuffing and theres evidence of some half assed sewing
its obvious hes been around for three decades
he and john who sits next to him are both clearly stoned as we join them
john for his part looks far too comfortable in the too worn red sox t shirt he wears
he eats directly from a box of fruity pebbles
reaching in for a last handful he finds the box almost empty
he raises it to empty the remainder into his mouth and accidentally pours fruity pebbles all over his face
it doesnt faze him much though as he brushes them off
its quite obvious that this is a guy who has never really given up his childhood
and has never given up his teddy bear
ted passes the bong to john
all im sayin is boston women are are on the whole a paler uglier sort than women from the elsewheres of life
thats bullshit what about lori
loris from pennsylvania not a boston girl
theyre not that bad
john takes a hit from the bong over teds next line
the fact that you have to say theyre not that bad means that they are that bad
they turn into drunk half white half pink monsters after hours at any beach
ted takes a hit from the bong
jesus this is weak

i gotta have a talk with my weed guy

we see two shots of johns car driving through the city we see john in the passengers seat putting visine into his eyes with only teds ears and eyes showing
as he drives his paws grip the wheel
we then cut to an overhead pull back shot as we move away from the car to reveal it crossing bostons huge suspension bridge
johns car pulls up the street and into the parking lot scraping its side against the corner headlight of one of the rental cars

there are wooden blocks attached to the pedals so that his feet can reach them
he slams on the brakes

thomas dryly waves back
ted pulls forward scraping the car again
he abruptly pulls out into traffic and another car swerves a bit to get around him honking
easy jersey license
ted drives away
thomas sits at his desk facing john
john its almost ten oclock
i know im sorry it wasnt my fault

i guess i
wasnt really prepared for a follow up question
john all you have to do is not fuck up and you get my job when i go to corporate next month
you will be the new branch manager
all you have to do is not fuck up and all youre doing is fucking up

the next least fucked up is alix and youve been here three fucking years longer than him
but im telling you i will promote the fuck out of him if you fuck up one more time

john emerges from thomas office and walks out into the front desk area
we see his coworker guy a burly patrick warburton type handing a car key and a rental envelope to a pleasant looking couple
he looks tired disheveled and a little bruised
there you go heres your key and rental agreement and a complimentary map of boston

the couple exits

you could put the ring in her ass and let her fart it out
john and ted sit on the couch in the same exact spots we saw them earlier bookending the day
john drinks a beer as they watch tv
ted lights up a bong and inhales
the tv blares the opening titles of the film flash gordon

ted jumps on john and starts playfully punching him in the face
wheres my ring johnny

i thought we were just doing funny names
no its gotta have a ski at the end
otherwise wheres the challenge
if theres no ski at the end of the root word then we would just be idiots saying nonsense
its raining with an occasional roll of thunder
lori lies in bed holding an ipad reading a gossip news site with the tv on
john comes out of the bathroom and cozies up next to her
oh look they found those missing hikers

ted runs into the room with no warning and leaps into bed right between lori and john
thunder buddies for life right johnny

lori rolls over and goes to sleep with a groan
lori enters the building
lori gets off the elevator where we see several signs that read plymouth public relations
lori goes to her desk looking exhausted
loris office friends gina michelle and tracy approach

well hello there

lori exits rexs office
rex casually gets up strolls over to her chair nonchalantly brushes his hand on the cushion where she was sitting and nonchalantly smells his hand
john and lori sit across from each other at a romantically set table
theyve just finished their meal
john has the remains of a lobster shell on his plate
that was perfect
a waitress approaches

actually could you wrap just this up for me

the waitress walks away

another waiter approaches with a bottle of champagne two glasses and some chocolate covered strawberries
senora here is your dessert and champagne
its a special night
weve been dating for four years
and hey all those rich black people cant be wrong right
it doesnt seem like four years does it
affectionately taking her no it doesnt
you had no business being out on that dance floor but im glad you were
we see lori out on the dance floor amidst a sea of dancing clubgoers
nearby we see john dancing with a girl and doing it very badly
hes putting too much into it obviously trying to impress her
the girl is gamely tolerating it but is clearly not digging the moves
john thrusts his butt back in one move accidentally bumping a girl behind him with enough force to send her sprawling on the floor
as the crowd reacts to this we see that it is lori
she starts to get up when john turns and rushes to help her to her feet
oh my god are you okay
oh god im so sorry
a little stunned yeah im
oh jesus im so so sorry
i didnt see you
it was an accident
well yeah i
i would hope it was an accident
did you hurt your head
my head hurts a lot
here let me get you some ice
she sits down
he reaches into a nearby glass pulls out a handful of ice and wraps it in a napkin
he puts it against her head
she inhales sharply for a moment
does it hurt
beat noticing him for the n
no its okay
beat noticing too im
they smile at each other
okay heres a question thatll show how much you actually care about me
you remember we stayed and talked until the place closed and then we went for late night eggs and waffles and we stayed there til a
watching a movie on the little tv in the diner
name the movie
but does that show that i care about you or i care about roger moore
im gonna give you the benefit of the doubt
and by the way my dancing was not that bad
your dancing was bad
i had some cool moves
so do people with parkinsons
thats not how i remember it
yeah how do you remember it
we see john leaning against the bar wearing a white navy officers uniform a la ted stryker in airplane
as stayin alive blasts from the jukebox
angle on lori who is up on the dance floor done up like julie hagerty
john takes his hat off and tosses it o
he struts up to the dance floor locks eyes with lori
they circle one another for a beat
john suavely takes off his jacket twirls it in the air a few times and tosses it o
he then strikes a finger up disco pose with a bullet sfx
he and lori begin disco dancing simultaneously
he jumps up locking his legs around lori who spins him around in circles as we cut back to whatever you say baby
hey heres to four more years huh
they clink glasses and take a sip
now i know we said no gifts but no we didnt
but i got you something anyway in clear violation of the no gift rule
there was no such rule
john reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out a small box
lori looks excited
lori ive wanted to give this to you for a long time
john slides the box over to lori
she picks it up
lori unwraps the box and opens it
inside is a pair of nice but not super expensive looking earrings
those are the ones you liked right
from that kiosk at the mall
check out the card
she opens up the card which we see as john describes it
it says happy year anniversary
see i even wrote the words with different colored markers so you wouldnt get bored while you were reading it
well um here
this is for you
lori hands john a small box
he opens it up revealing a very nice watch
oh wow a hamilton
he puts it on his wrist
i remember you liked it when you saw tom brady wearing one in gq
yeah i mean his was analog but this is so awesome i love it
she reacts a bit to this
someday theres gonna be a ring in there
but i wanna wait til i can get you something really special yknow
i just dont have the money right now
john i dont need the hope diamond all i want is i know but its important to me that you have the engagement ring you deserve
and what with the credit bubble
the supreme court
i mean look at haiti
look im only saying this because i love you but thats not realistic
youre never gonna have any kind of a career if youre always partying and wasting time with ted
oh jesus here we go john please get him to find his own place so we can get on with our lives
look can we talk about this another time and just enjoy our anniversary dinner
lets talk about it ten years from now
rolling his eyes with a lori we cant talk about this every time we go out
look hes been my best friend since i was eight
and i was not a popular child
you have to understand i had no friends before he came along
hes the only reason i ever gained any fucking confidence
i coulda wound up like that asian kid at virginia tech but i didnt
cause of him
so yknow im not that psyched to just like kick him out
well its good to know that a talking teddy bear is the only thing that kept you from gunning down your classmates but john youre not eight
youre thirty five
and unless youre too blind to notice hes not your only friend anymore
you have me
and i love you
i love you too
you know that
look ive put the best physical years of my life into this
i mean im cute now but in a few years my bodys gonna fall off a fucking cliff
thingsll be hanging and stretching in ways that might scare a man
i need to feel secure in the fact that you wont leave me when that happens
not only will i not leave you its gonna be even better
cause i can have sex with you and press your arm fat against a comic book so i can see it backwards
so does he
and my boobs and vagina will all be in the same place so thats a lot less movin around for you
i can do it all with one hand
exactly and you can do whatever you want with the other hand
i can write a novel
maybe a bestseller
we can achieve critical acclaim and become rich just by screwing each other
they both laugh hard
well i hope these jokes have distracted you from the actual problems in our relationship
we cant put the real conversation off forever john
i dunno i got a lotta fuckin jokes
their car pulls up
they start to get out
ah shit hang on my phone fell under the seat somewhere
can you call it
lori punches his number on her cellphone
after a beat we hear the imperial march from the empire strikes back
thats my ringtone
laughs embarrassed oh yeah
what is it
it sounds negative
no its from the notebook
he reaches under the seat fishing for the phone as she goes inside
this is gonna take some doin
all right well ill see you upstairs
he continues digging for the phone as she walks inside
lori walks toward the apartment but stops as she hears loud music coming from inside
she approaches the door cautiously and opens it revealing
lori enters a haze of pot smoke and a very much trashed apartment empty bottles wrappers etc
ted sits on the sofa with a small group of trashy looking women
theyre watching romancing the stone which plays very loudly on the tv
what the hell is all this
hey youre home early
the ladies and i were just watching romancing the stone
got it on blu ray
came in a two pack with jewel of the nile but i dont know that well end up watchin that one
this place is a wreck
who are these girls
oh where are my manners
lori this is angelique heavenly cherene and sauvignon blanc
i love you girls
yknow somewhere out there are four terrible fathers i wish i could thank for this great night
the girls ad lib hello nice to meet you etc
lori glances around the room then screams as she sees something in the corner
what is that
a shit in the corner
on the floor
theres a shit
oh man thats what dierdre was doin over there in the corner for so long
remember she was crouched over there and i thought she was just makin a call or there is a shit
on my floor
yeah shes passed out in the bathroom now she seemed like she was hopped up on somethin
i mean mystery solved i what the fuck
lori if i can now this is just speculation but
is it possible that this is not so much about the stool in the corner and more about maybe tonights dinner not measuring up to your expectations
lori is speechless with rage
at that moment we see the lobster head poke in aggressively from behind the door
who lives here
im comin to get whoever lives here
you owe me lobster money
thats my friend john
not the lobster the guy runnin it
at that moment john enters holding his cell phone
found my phone
he stops seeing everyone there
whats goin on
then noticing is that a shit
ted and john walk slowly down the ramp circling the massive see through tank occasionally stopping to observe some of the more bizarre varieties of fish
john is oddly restrained
something is on his mind
as they stroll we see a nearby man keeping an eye on them
he seems much more interested in them than in the fish
this we will find out later is donny
god there are some fucked up fish out there
jesus look at that one
mister tough guy fish
tough guy voice hey
whatsa big idea
well that is a big idea i beg pardon
look at that guy
wasp y white guy fish
tight ass white guy voice i dont care for some of conan obriens humor
i dont like irish humor
and this food is too flavorful
i dont care for flavor in my food
switching to goofy voice as a bottle nosed fish swims oh hey sorry im late guys
hey wheres everybody goin
any of you guys got a tissue
im allergic to water
you gotta move out
ted turns and stares at john for a beat
its gotta happen
ted sits down on a bench a little stunned and dazed
what did i do
john looks heartbroken at this response
ted and john sit side by side on a bench next to the penguin habitat
ted my relationship is at a very delicate stage and yknow lori and i may just need a little space right now
plus a hooker took a shit in our apartment
hey look that was a tough night for all of us
lori is staring at the o
poop in the corner
she is trying to pick it up with a shoebox
in the background we can see an almost panicky grossed out john peering out from behind the bathroom door
its so gross
dont tell me i dont wanna hear about it
did you get it
oh my god
tell me when you get it
aaaa i got some on my thumb
you can never cook with that hand again
im serious learn to cook other handed

i know you do johnny
ill help you get on your feet out there i promise
and well hang out a lot right
fuck all the time
arms wide for a hug bring it over here
john hugs ted
ted hugs him back
we hear a squeak and a high pitched recorded voice saying i wuv you
john and ted pull away from each other uncomfortably
that was the the thing the old yeah no i know that doesnt mean im not gay
weve got to get you a job
john and ted head toward the store
ted is dressed in a coat and tie and looks very uncomfortable
i look stupid
no you dont
you look dapper
i look like snuggles accountant
they pause as john straightens teds tie
look i know it sucks but you gotta make some money so you can pay for an apartment
i dont wanna work at a grocery store
well you have no skills
i told you i can totally be a lawyer
as i said you would need a law degree from a law school
im a special case
im a fucking talking bear
they might make an exception cause theyre all like aaa
this bear can talk and do stuff
lets give him a job and maybe hell give us a few laughs but then theyre surprised at what a stellar performance im turnin in
and then they practically have to give me the anderson case
look you get the job and well celebrate after
john discreetly pulls out a baggie of weed
and if i dont get the job will we still smoke that pot
patting john on the leg yeah
okay good speech coach
ted sits opposite frank the grocery store manager
we see his name and title on a desk nameplate
frank sits at the desk staring at ted
you think you got what it takes
a beat then no ones ever talked to me like that before
over music john and ted walk across the common passing various park goers
the occasional person notices and points with a hey isnt that
sort of look
they passes three cute girls who flag ted down
two pose with him as the third takes their picture with her cellphone
ted poses for the photo with one hand on the girls breast
she laughs hard
ted waves goodbye and he and john make their way over to a park bench
john takes out the weed looks around for a beat then starts to discreetly roll a joint
well im a former celebrity with a minimum wage job
this must be what the cast of different strokes feels like
john and ted react startled
john stuffs the weed in his pocket accidentally dropping the buds in the rolling papers on the ground
angle on a creepy looking man glancing at them repeatedly
this is donny the fat kid we saw in the prologue
he has grown up into a thinner but no less creepy man
im sorry to bother you but my son and i couldnt help but admire your teddy bear
adjust to reveal his son who looks exactly like fat young donny from earlier
a little uncomfortable oh
um thank you
and this is my boy robert
i have to tell you ive been fascinated by your story ever since i was a boy
i remember seeing you on the carson show
you were just wonderful
brief angle on the ground where a pigeon is pecking at the dropped weed
yeah that was ah
that was a good time
i wonder is there any chance i could purchase the bear from you
for my son
i want it
hey im not an it pal
im a he
leaning down to his level im sorry little guy but my bear isnt for sale
ive had him since i was about your age
hes very special to me
sit up straight when you talk to me
ew why the fuck did he say that
dont swear in front of my child
we are very interested in the bear
if youd like to work out some sort of arrangement heres my address and phone number
he writes on a slip of paper and hands it to john
john smiles awkwardly and puts it in his wallet
here it goes in the really important pocket for really important stuff
donny and robert walk off
donny turns and steals a glance back at ted as they move off
can you imagine what that little shit would do to me
oh man i can totally see him just taking you down to the basement and really slowly de limbing you while singing some creepy victorian nursery rhyme
john tugs on one of teds arms trying to creep him out
he then breaks into a creepy falsetto
why do you have to take it so far
now its real
fuck you again for that
cmon lets go find a better place to get stoned
after a beat the pigeon flies into frame slamming right into a fucking tree
john and ted walk into the building
john carries two cardboard boxes and ted carries one smaller one
theres a couch a coffee table and a couple of boxes
john and ted put down their boxes and stand just inside the doorway
i guess this is it huh
yeah sure is
first night on your own
first night in my beautiful new apartment
they say theyre aint hardly been no murders here
they awkwardly nod to each other both knowing that john must leave soon
if you need anything
ill be fine johnny
i know you will buddy
they regard each other for a moment then john slowly turns and walks off down the hall
he turns back to smile and wave
from johns pov we see a diminutive looking ted give a wan wave back
he looks very alone as the camera recedes
john sits on the couch putting his tie on as he watches tv
lori comes over and sits down next to him
i just wanna say thank you
what you did with ted was a big step and i know it wasnt easy but i just want you to know that i love you for it
and i think this a new beginning for our relationship
hey anything for you
this is all part of the new grown up adult john bennett
so get used to him
she gives him a kiss and starts to undo his tie
yknow i dont have to be at work for another twenty minutes
guiding her down onto the ooh thats perfect im only gonna need one
she laughs and they kiss
you know what my favorite thing about you is
after four years you can still surprise me
to step up and change such a big part of your life just to make your girlfriend happier
i dunno i bet you most guys couldnt do it
most guys dont have you to motivate em
im sorry if i was pushy about it
no you were right
look the reason i love you so much is the same reason i guess i take you for granted sometimes
its cause youre
no what i mean is theres just no version of this universe where you and i dont end up together
that sounds like something stephen hawking would say to his girlfriend
but do you get what im saying
yeah i do
and i feel exactly the same way about you
smiling coyly as she ooh
is that a flash gordon ray gun in your pocket or are you glad to see me
john pulls the flash gordon gun out of his pocket and shows it to her
she cracks up
ted is at his station finishing checking out a customer
thank you please come again we have a lot more groceries
the customer exits
ted sighs with boredom
he turns to ellen the large african american woman at the next station
whos that over there
angle on a very attractive blonde girl bagging groceries a few aisles away this is tami lynn
thats the new bag girl
i dont know her name but she seems cute
you know what id like to do to her
somethin i call a dirty fozzie
ted waves to the girl
she waves back
he makes a kissy face at her
she giggles and blows him a kiss back
he pantomimes hard thrusting standing up sex
her eyes widen for a beat as she stares then smiles
he grabs an oh henry bar and pantomimes fellatio
the girl laughs hysterically
close angle on ted as white liquid sprays all over his face from one side then from the other
widen to reveal hes squirting two bottles of pump hand soap on either side of him
the girl laughs and shakes her head no
okay so thats where well draw the line
john sits at his workstation playing a tbd video game on his iphone
how you holding up
oh im all right
getting used to things thats all
its gonna be all right
yknow i went through something like this with my last boyfriend
yeah we were dating for eight months and i was really in love with him and then he was deported back to iran
so i get it
i guess we both lost our furry little guy
johns phone rings the theme from knight rider
he sees teds name pop up with a photo of ted smiling open mouthed at the camera with his arms outstretched and a bra on his head
john picks up
what are you doin
you wanna come over and catch a buzz
i could probably swing by after work
fuck that i traded off yesterday so i got the night shift
cmon im bored as crap over here just swing by for a bit
i cant just ditch work man
look im trying to get my shit together and be an adult here yknow
for loris sake
ted sits in the tub talking on the phone
he has suds in his hair and there are a couple of little toy boats in the water
from here we intercut back and forth from him and john
and then ill kick you out i promise
cmon i picked up the cheers dvd box set and supposedly everybody talks shit about each other in the interviews
yeah and apparently george wendt confesses to a rape
sometimes adults get high
they do john
sometimes they do
youll kick me out in five
john i have to kick you out
i am extraordinarily busy today i have so much teddy bear paperwork to get through it is retarded
five minutes and youre outta here
john turns and looks back at thomas in his office
what do i tell thomas
just tell him you dont feel well
john stands in front of thomas who sits at his desk
i gotta duck out for a bit
lori tried to break up a dog fight and i guess she got hurt pretty bad
oh my god
yeah shes thats the way she is she sees trouble she tries to help out and i guess one of these dogs clamped his jaws on her forearm and he
wouldnt let go until the fireman showed up and had to stick his finger in his ass
yeah shes pretty shook up
oh my god
up the dogs ass right
yeah thats how they thats how they get em to stop biting sure
go go go take care of it let me know how she is
oh gosh thank you sir
i owe you one
you dont owe me anything go
john smiles wanly and exits
looking at his own finger jesus
angle on the tv ted danson sits in a chair being interviewed
was there cocaine on the set of cheers
lemme figure out the best way to answer that
are there naked dicks in gay porn
yes there was quite a lot of cocaine
i mean it was the eighties
and i was king
i was king of the eighties
i was ted fucking danson
and not only that i was sam fucking mayday malone

gee lemme think are there naked dicks in gay porn
yes i was quite beloved
angle on ted and john watching
they have a bong
you know hes exactly who you want him to be
someone the likes of which we should all aspire to become
smallest dick ive ever seen on a man
angle back on john and ted passing him bong here try this stuff
i told my guy to step it up and he gave me this
what is it
its called kennedys head
its actually pretty mellow
that doesnt sound very mellow
no its it makes you cerebral
kennedy was smart
thats what it refers to
decisions under pressure
cuban missile crisis

john takes a hit off the bong then glances around
yknow this place looks great
yeah its all ikea

we couldnt go and i was all upset but then she had a miscarriage and so we ended up getting to go skydiving and it was so scary but it was so much fun
it sounds like everything worked out then
i guess god wanted me to go skydiving yknow

tami lynn laughs heartily at this as does john
lori isnt quite as delighted
im surprised john didnt tell you already
seems like you guys have seen each other every day since you moved out
well its funny usually the first item on our agenda is whats goin on with lori
so im surprised that one slipped through the cracks
we do we talk about you all the time
oh my god remember ted last week we were talking about
neat all of loris shoes are
that was a lengthy conversation
and we were saying like a lot of women look like unsteady horses when they wear high heels but lori has a sort of
oh my god yes
lori stares at him for a beat then so tami where are you from

fascinated to meet teds girlfriends
what do you mean girlfriends

no no thats not what shes sayin at all right lori

ted and tami lynn exit leaving john and lori at the table
what a cunt
covering ears in pain ooh
i hate that word
that word is so sharp
its like an electric sword slashing everything in its path
well you didnt exactly stick up for me
im trying to walk a line here i want to be fair to you and to him yknow
yeah well i think youre being a little more fair to him
yknow your boss called this morning and asked me how my arm was
because of the dog fight i tried to break up
if i had to hazard a guess id say that was some bullshit lie you made up so you could take off work and go to teds
am i right
i made you out to be a hero
john ted moved out so we could give ourselves a chance without him
youre not really giving anything a chance if youre blowing off work to get high with your teddy bear
it wont happen again i promise
with a bit of anger yes
i wanna break up
this isnt gonna work
were in two different places
lori look i know you promised me you were gonna grow up and take our life together seriously
hey ted moved out didnt he
i did that for you for us
and it wasnt easy
jesus he might as well still be living with us john
you spend more time with him than you do with me
ive been getting stoned too much
i know that
ive been bumming around with ted too much i know that too
give me one more chance i promise i can fix it
lori i love you too much please give me one more chance
i need a man john
not a boy with a teddy bear
man right here in front of you
look at these pecs
look at the hair on my upper lip
i just farted
lori cant help but let a small laugh escape
she softens a bit
this really is your last chance
i cant do this anymore
you wont have to
i love you
he kisses her
aw sweetie i love you so much
you wont be sorry i swear
she smiles at him then did you really just fart
yeah but i pushed it that way with my hand
wonder where itll hit first
wider angle on the restaurant
for a moment nothing happens
then a guy at a table on the right sitting with a couple other men and women screams into his napkin followed by his dining companions
who did this to us
im here on business
teds boss frank emerges from the back writing on a clipboard
he looks up and his expression turns to confused anger as he sees an unusually long line at ellens register
what the hell
he walks over to the line
a guy in line turns and notices him
hey dude you think you could open more than one register
theres like a thousand people here
theres supposed to be three registers open for gods sake
he looks around aggravated for a moment then storms off toward the back
he looks around the butchers counter and produce area then walk into the back storeroom
frank opens the door and reacts with shock
reverse angle where we see ted on top of tami lynn who is almost naked
he is doing a very close approximation of banging her wildly
we see his furry bear butt pumping away with its little tail on the end
frank screams in shock and horror
frank sits at his desk addressing ted
you had sexual intercourse with a coworker in a storeroom filled with produce that we sell to the public
that took guts
we need guts
im promoting you
we see the closed sign on the door
ted exits finishing off a bottle of beer
he walks around to the dumpster alley and lines up for a kareem style sky hook shot into a trash can
he takes the shot kareem
the bottle smashes off the side of the can and shatters
you suck kareem
we hear a soft footstep somewhere o
ted turns and looks around
there appears to be no one in the darkness
he looks around for a beat and finds nothing
and finds himself facing donny who stands eerily lit by a single outdoor wall bulb
are you all alone out here
no im not
you know youre never alone when youre with christ
you know robert and i could give you a very very good home
im pretty happy where i am
i just got a shitty new apartment i can offer you six thousand dollars in railroad bonds
they were left to me by my father
well gosh you know since i just returned from active duty in the civil war that sounds really appealing
oh wait no that was a hundred and fifty years ago and i dont give a shit
tami lynn approaches
teddy come on were gonna have pop tarts and cigarettes with my mom before she goes to work
yeah im comin sweetheart
yeah my dance card is quite full so im gonna have to decline
i really wish you wouldnt
you know id like to thank you for creepin up my night and
jesus be with you
ted hurries off
angle on donny who looks eerily determined
john and lori walk up to the fabulously expansive house in cambridge
its a very impressive estate with no expense spared
smiling at him warmly im glad youre here
yeah me too
is it cool if i kick your boss ass
that wont affect your workplace chemistry will it
rex throws open the door
there she is
i was worried you werent coming
hi kiddo how ya doin
wheres your bunny rabbit

ushering them in got it
hey this house is fucking huge
i know guys try not to get lost
the party is a very costly looking event uniformed servers walking around with trays of cocktails and hors douvres tables laden with lavish looking food displays and floral arrangements a
piece big band and hundreds of guests
a large banner reads happy th anniversary plymouth public relations
oh here come the ladies
gina michelle and tracy approach
everyone adlibs their hellos to john and lori
a waiter walks by with a tray of champagne
lori and the girls each take a glass
say listen why dont john and i give you gals a chance to talk tampax while we go grab a drink at the bar huh
rex and john are walking up the stairs to the second floor of his house
rex points out various items bought at auction
john is visibly unenthused
he does not like this guy and definitely does not trust him
and thats a wade boggs autographed bat
just barely outbid phil donahue for that at auction
and those boxing gloves were worn by joe louis in his first fight
passing an abstract this is art
do you get it
passing wall mounted pair of these were john lennons glasses
worth about two million dollars
passing photo on wall thats me and tom skerritt
oh and check this out
rex indicates a small bronze colored item on a stand
know what that is
thats lance armstrongs nut
john quickly pulls his hand away
something isnt it
had it freeze dried and bronzed
every now and then when i feel like my lifes gettin me down and things are tough i just come in here and look at it and it reminds me
that things arent so bad
that some people have it worse than me
i mean hes only got one ball and i have three
one of them of course being his
youve led a rich life
ive fucked the shit outta life
so talk to me goose
how are things with you and lori

i think youre a great guy and shes very lucky
john is a bit surprised not unpleasantly so to hear this
thats good to hear
well thats how it is so
there we go
they stand there for a beat looking at lance armstrongs nut
johns phone rings the knight rider theme
john answers it
intercut periodically between john and ted who stands in the foreground with one finger in his ear
in the background we see a party in full swing
you gotta get over here man
whats going on
im havin a little impromptu thing with some people and john
sam jones is here
flash fucking gordon

my buddys in town with his cousin and whos with em

softly into phone his hair is parted down the middle
just like in the movie

john looks down at the main area of the party and sees lori happily chatting with her co workers
there are moments in a mans life nathan hale i regret that i have but one life to give for my country
alan hale yes i accept the role of the skipper on gilligans island
john this is your alan hale moment

john races o
and rex raises his scotch glass to his mouth
im gonna make traditional to your girlfriend
and then fuck her in the ass
we have a game plan
the football fight music from flash gordon starts playing as john bolts o
john sprints out of the house and runs down the walkway
he leaps over a hedge toward the parking area
he slides across the hood of loris car gets in quickly starts the car and backs out
cut to various shots of john racing through the city on his way to teds
finally he pulls up to teds apartment
john throws open the door
the place is as lively as it can be
the party is packed with people including alix and tanya johns co workers from liberty
there are also a large number of booze swilling guys and hot chicks
ted runs up wearing a blazer
thank christ you made it
i got ten minutes wheres flash gordon
okay get ready man
to someone o
this is the guy i was tellin you about
john turns to look in the direction ted is indicating
the shot slows down into slo mo as johns eyes widen and he sees
opposite angle across the room sam j
jones turns in slo mo to face john
he is inexplicably still sporting the same hairstyle he had in the flash gordon movie
we hear the theme from flash gordon
we intercut back and forth from him to john on john he stands frozen in awe
on sam he smiles as he begins to walk toward the camera in johns pov
on john he continues to stare in frozen awe
on sam still slowly walking toward camera in johns pov but he is now dressed in the flash gordon costume
on john he continues to stare in frozen awe
jones flies on the flying jetski from the movie
john stands behind him on the back with his arms around sams chest as if on the back seat of a motorcycle
john has a huge elated smile on his face
on john he still stares in awe
on sam he smiles and offers an outstretched hand for a handshake
back to normal speed sam walks up to john with ted by his side
john this is sam jones
sam this is my best friend in the whole world john
good to meet you
in absolute fucking awe i
thank you for saving every one of us
hey lets do some shots huh
oh my god yes
sam passes out shots of southern comfort
raising his glass death to ming
john and ted look at each other squealing with delight
everyone then does their shots
hey you guys seem pretty cool

john and ted dont answer for a beat
they look at each other nervously
its clear neither one has any experience with this sort of thing
aw come on dudes
dont tell me youve never done it before
a little scared not

john ted and sam emerge from the bathroom
johns eyes are wide and enthusiastic
ted has a little bit of powder on his nose and his ears are flattened back
and sam is just playing it cool
lets party like the s huh
show us how flash
we just gotta bang a lotta girls named stephanie
looking around intensely all these people need to be talked to
john and ted sit staring at each other intensely across the table

ted stands opposite a group of party guests who sit on the couch
he holds a knife
no see i can do this
my teddy bear biology gives me superhuman reflexes
let him try it man
fuck it all right
guy puts his hand down on the coffee table and ted starts doing the knife trick from aliens
he gets it right for a few seconds then stabs the guy right through the hand

they stare at each other for a beat
she looks as hurt angry and betrayed as a woman can be
he throws up all over the floor
lori storms out into the street
after a beat john runs out after her

ted looks after him then slowly lowers his head sadly
he sits down on the sidewalk dazed and defeated
john pulls up in his car and sadly goes inside
john sits on the bed and turns on the tv
he flips through the channels seeing various clips of shows
eventually he shuts off the tv
he opens his wallet and takes out a picture of lori
he looks at it sadly
john and lori play mini golf

they stand next to a soapbox car that they have built and painted
year old john and ted are at the top of a hill with the soapbox racer
ted is in the racer wearing a helmet

when he turns we see there is a white stripe of paint going down his back
ted exits the apartment holding a pack of cigarettes and a lighter
he pulls one cigarette out with his mouth and goes to light it
he then notices something out of the corner of his eye
he reacts with a take and sprints o
dropping the cigarette and the lighter
after a beat a skunk shuffles through frame after him
angle on a tv guide cover that reads simpsons reaches th season
angle on present day john and ted watching tv expressionless and bored looking
rex sits at his desk and stares out the window
so word through the grapevine is you are newly solo
i have tickets to see norah jones at the hatch shell tonight and i would love it if youd go with me
youre asking me out the day after i broke up with someone
look im gonna cut the shit here

and if youre miserable and you hate it i promise i will never even hint at the subject again
rex i dont think its smart
look im an asshole
i know that
it worked for me in high school and its been like a reflex ever since
sigh lori the worst that can happen is you have a fun casual date with a guy who only wants a chance to prove to you that he can be
something more than a jerk
besides youre a huge catch and its about time somebody treated you that way
i guess it beats crying myself to sleep every night
pick you up at seven
its raining outside
john sulks on the bed leafing through a tintin comic book
theres a knock at the door
who is it
johnny its me
johnny open the door please
i wanna talk
john ignores him
a few beats go by then the window slides open from the outside and ted tumbles in landing on the floor soaked
ted shakes the water off himself like a dog
john flinches back trying not to get wet
look johnny i know youre pissed but just listen to me for five seconds
i saw lori out on a date with rex
im serious john i went over to your house to talk to lori to try and take some of the heat off you and i saw rex picking her up
they were going to the hatch shell
youre un fucking believable you know that

i wanted you to come because youre supposedly my best friend
is that why youve manipulated me for years to stay eternally eight years old at the expense of the rest of my life
whoa whoa its not my fault you didnt care enough about your relationship

and you know by blamin me you just make yourself look like a pussy
sometimes i think back to that christmas morning when i was eight years old
and i wish id just gotten a teddy ruxpin

rux fucking pin
ted stares at him for a beat then lunges at him wrapping his whole body around johns face and head like the facehuggers from aliens
john stumbles around the room trying to pry ted off
eventually he stumbles into the bathroom and crashes through the shower door shattering it
he and ted exchange punches to the face
john lands a particularly hard one which sends ted flying across the room and slamming into the wall
ted hits the floor and runs out of the bathroom
john stumbles to his feet
ted scrambles across the bed reaches into the bedside drawer and pulls out a bible
john staggers out of the bathroom just in time to be pelted in the head as ted throws the bible at him
fucking jesus fucking christ
god fucking dammit
ted throws other objects at him including beer cans and the phone
john and ted stare at each other for a beat each one breathing heavily ted is now on the floor
john charges at ted sailing across the bed and tackling him knocking over the side table and lamp in the process
john and ted scuffle on the floor engaging in a realistic as possible fistfight
each one gets a number of blows in
john throws ted off him and back onto the bed
ted taunts him
john jumps at ted throwing a jab at him
but ted dodges and johns fist goes into the wall above the headboard
he struggles to pull free as he flails about with his other hand grabbing at ted
ted dodges again and scrambles up johns head jumping up and grabbing the chain on the ceiling fan turning it on and causing ted to swing back and forth
john pulls free and stumbles backward off the bed
he notices a tall free standing lamp in the corner
he pulls the plug out of the wall and uses the lamp to take a swing at ted
ted swings out of the way
john takes a second swing but the lamp cord catches on the fans motor
the lamp is ripped from johns grasp it swings around through the air and cracks him in the side of the head
john goes down whacking his head a second time on the baseboard of the bed
he howls in pain as he lies on his stomach clutching his head
ted takes advantage of this
he jumps down from the cord and pulls the antenna off the clock radio next to the bed
he jumps down to the floor yanks johns pants partway down and starts whipping his bare ass with the antenna
john yells in fury and kicks blindly at ted
he turns over kicking ted in the face and kicking the cabinet that the tv is on
the tv wobbles and falls off the cabinet landing with a crash right on his groin
john lies there with the tv on his crotch and his pants down and breathes heavily
ted still dazed from the kick to the face crawls over to him
both breathe heavily
johns breathing deteriorates into sobs
why are you crying
my dick is in the tv
john continues to sob
ted climbs down off the table and up onto the bed
he pushes the tv off john then lies down next to him
ted starts to sob himself
im so sorry johnny
im so sorry
so am i man
i love you
i love you too
john hugs ted who hugs him back
you gotta let me help you make things right with you and lori
there is no putting things right
she hates me
no john we can get her back
look remember when you were ten and you hit that squirrel with your bb gun and then when we saw it fall from the tree we both starting crying
and then we ran up to it and tried to give it cpr
and it came back to life
john we could do that again
ted we crushed its rib cage and blew out its lungs trying to give it cpr
we can get lori back
a huge crowd has gathered for the norah jones concert
they cheer as she sings come away with me backed by a large string section
angle on rex and lori who cheer in the audience along with everyone else
they seem to be having a fantastic time
god shes so brave
your music is so norah finishes the song
thanks so much

the crowd cheers
angle on a dressing room sign which reads norah jones
we move inside the dressing room as norah enters and pours a drink
hey play chopsticks you jazzy slut

she hugs him
well im not a hot half muslim chick who sold million records but im hangin in there

angle on the doorway where john enters a little nervous
norah this is my friend john
hi norah jones
shaking his hand ha
whoa relax there sweaty
you ready to bring down the house
thank you for the opportunity ms
jesus you look fantastic
well youre probably not used to seeing me fully clothed
me and norah met in at a party at belinda carlisles house and we had awkward fuzzy sex in the coatroom
actually you werent so bad for a guy with no penis
i have written so many letters to hasbro about that
the crowd is cheering
norah is back out on stage at the piano
okay im gonna give my chops a rest here and invite a friend of mine up to the stage
hes gonna sing a song to a very special lady in the audience who he loves very much
lets give a big hand to john bennett
the crowd applauds dutifully as john walks out onstage
angle on lori and rex
lori reacts shocked
oh my god
john takes center stage and looks down at lori
this is for lori collins
because i love her
this song always reminds me of the most important night of my life
the night we met
its the theme song from the movie octopussy
the band begins playing
all time high
inexplicably norah is playing the saxophone with a pair of shades on
angle on lori and rex
rex is visibly derisive but we see that lori is softening
fake voice covering his mouth and looking away you suck get off the stage
then for loris benefit hey come on guys
the crowd starts to take the cue
get off the stage
we wanna hear norah
angle on ted in the wings
angle on a crazed audience member who rushes the stage racing toward john
youre an asshole
john flinches as he raises the mic stand off the floor at the last second so the base is sticking out horizontally
the crazy guy runs right into it bashing himself in the face
he goes down unconscious and bleeding
everyone gasps as the music stops
a few concert personnel rush out to check the guy
someone call an ambulance
the crowd is now shouting angrily at john
but he is only focused n one spot in the crowd
he sees that lori and rex are gone
almost oblivious to the rest of the frenzy he sighs heartbroken
a couple of concert security personnel haul him offstage
rex escorts lori to his car
that was insane
did you see the way that guys body hit the ground
it was like a rag doll
yeah id rather just not talk about it
you want to go get a drink after this
i feel like i could use one after seeing a guy almost die
nope i think id rather you just take me home
one drink come on
nope not really feeling up to it
alright alright i get it
i dont blame you
when you think about it it was actually really unfair of him to embarrass you like that
just to be clear i am not embarrassed
listen john and i may have our problems but at least he tried
you know what
i dont feel like talking to you about this
she walks away
where you going
taking a cab
im going home
as she disappears out of earshot rex closes his eyes and releases a fart
lori gets out of the shower and begins towelling off still reeling with disgust from her encounter with rex
after a few moments theres a knock at the door
lori sighs with annoyance and walks to the door still in her towel
she looks through the peephole but theres no one there
she opens the door cautiously and looks out into the hall
theres no one there
down here i swear to god im not lookin up your towel
she looks down with a start and sees ted standing there
hes blocking his view with one hand
not lookin up your towel
not lookin at your funny business
pulling towel closer to her ted
whatre you doing here
what do you want
i need to talk to you
look if youre here to fight johns battle for hi lori do me a favor and let me talk first and then you can say whatever you want
theres a beat
she reluctantly considers
lori now in a robe sits down on the couch facing ted
look john loves you very much
more than anything in the world
and hes fallin to fuckin pieces without you
he knows he screwed up big time but you gotta believe me that is wasnt all his fault
if youll just give him one more chance to be with you she rolls her eyes
listen to me
if youll just give him one more chance
i promise i will leave and never come back
hell be all yours
just give him one more chance
thats a very nice offer but i dont want you to do that
this is about john and me and our problems
and i dont think it can be fixed
because of me
look you want him to be a man
and im the one whos keepin that from happening
as long as hes got his teddy bear hes still a boy
and i care about him as much as you do
but im willing to give up the boy so you can have the man
we can see lori starting to soften a bit
look im givin this the best shot i got here lori
im beggin you
im no good at this emotional crap but i gotta help my best friend
just talk to him
ill talk to him
hes waitin for me down at charleys
maybe you could yknow
go down instead of me
youll regret it for the rest of your life if you dont
alright alright ill go
lori emerges from the bedroom dressed and heads for the door
ted is on the couch watching tv
flipping on tv hey you mind if i stay and watch the sox
the door shuts and shes gone
ted gets up and walks into the kitchen
he opens the fridge
jesus christ what a chick fridge
yoplait a cantaloupe and a brita water filter
he opens up a crisper drawer and looks at a six pack of beer bottles
michelob ultra tuscan orange grapefruit
my god america is imploding
he shakes his head as he opens the beer and walks into the other room
he settles down in a recliner and watches the game
after a moment theres a knock at the door
ted sighs with annoyance and gets up
forget your keys
he walks to the door and opens it up
you know your beer suck he freezes and looks up
we reveal donny the creepy man from earlier with his son robert
donny throws a sack over ted trapping him
loris car pulls up and she gets out
lori enters and looks around
she spots john who looks up from a menu
he is surprised to see her
she sighs and walks over to him
what what are you doing here
you can thank ted
john smiles slightly
how are you
made myself a nice little home at the midtown hotel up the street
id show you around but its kinda classy
they require an undershirt and at least one visible cold sore for all customers
shall i sit
theres a beat
a busboy brings them each a water
so works good
everything good there
there is no rex
i guess we cant make small talk all day so ill say what i wanna say
i could sit here and tell you im sorry it was a huge misunderstanding and im ready to change
but i dont think you wanna hear any of that crap
im not gonna try and get you to take me back
why would you
ive been a really shitty boyfriend for the last four years
i dont deserve you
i didnt take our relationship seriously even though i love you more than life itself
all i want is
just to end on good terms
because i owe that to you
i want you to be happy
and for us to be friends
a little taken aback wow
i appreciate that
thats pretty much it
he takes out some money and puts it on the table paying the check
he smiles at her and walks out
she sits there for a beat
donnys car pulls up
the house is a low class creepily shabby looking boston home think buffalo bill in silence of the lambs
its close to one end of the base of a bridge
donny carries the sack inside and unceremoniously dumps ted onto the floor
ted looks around
its just as shitty on the inside as on the outside
on the walls there are a disturbing number of newspaper clippings photo spreads etc
most are from press from teds media heyday but some are photographs of ted and john out in public that donny clearly took himself
yes as you can see youve been part of our family for quite some time
heh you know whats hilarious i got tons of pictures of you guys at my house
daddy is he all mine
hes all yours my little winner
youve arrived at a lucky time ted
its almost roberts play hour
im guessin you guys dont have a ps
im guessin youre more of a wooden horse with a wig kinda family
ted is led into roberts room
its a fairly sparse room with some toys strewn about
a wooden rocking horse with a wig stands in the corner
robert sits down on the floor smiling at him
donny stands in the doorway
now remember ted you belong to robert now
so you will do as he says
yknow you think youre just gonna get away with a kidnapping
nice fuckin example youre settin for your kid
leaning in to ted with ted flinches nervously
donny moves back
when i was a little boy i saw you on television
and i thought you were the most amazing most wonderful thing id ever seen
and i asked my father if i could have a magical teddy bear too
and he said no
and i was heartbroken
i decided that if i ever had a son i would never say no to him
maybe no to a snickers bar every once in awhile wouldnt hurt
me and ted are gonna be best friends daddy
happy play time
donny shuts the door
robert stares at ted
jesus fucking christ
daddy said no bad words
yeah well fuck your dad
ted scrambles for the window and tries to open it
it doesnt budge
he takes a running leap at it but just bounces off like a plush toy and lands on the floor
robert stands over him
i said a bad word one time and daddy punished me for it
thats a great story i felt like i was there
daddy gave me an ouch
now i have to give you an ouch
robert grabs ted with one hand and gets a grip on one of teds ears with the other hand
robert pulls on the ear as hard as he can and rips the ear off
ted screams as loud as he can
robert looks at him holding the ear
well do it your way
you wanna play a game or somethin
its play time lets play a game
yeah i wanna play a game
good good hey how bout we play a little game of hide and seek
i love hide and seek
well now robert your dad likes you to show good manners right
well a well mannered kid lets his guest hide first dont ya think
theres a beat
robert stares blankly at him then okay you hide first
okay now you count to a hundred and then try to find me okay
do i need to wash my hands before this game
well no you god thats a weird fuckin question no just start countin
robert sits down covers his eyes and starts counting
ted grabs a chair and starts sliding it over toward the door
okay no peekin now or youll get kid cancer
ted reaches the door climbs up onto the chair and turns the doorknob
he opens the door and exits out into the hallway
after a beat he re enters grabs his severed ear and exits again
ted nervously moves down the hallway toward the front door
he has it in sight on the far end of the living room but when he gets closer to the living room doorway he sees that donny is sitting in
an armchair watching the incredible hulk the old tv show
ted darts back into the hallway before hes seen but in the process bumps into a small table with a lamp and a couple knick knacks on it
one of them a small ceramic penguin falls over making a sound
donny turns and looks in the direction of the hallway
hows play time
roberts hands still cover his eyes
ted are you making friends with robert
ted looks panicky not knowing what to do
after a beat donny leans forward as if hes about to get up
daddy youre gonna ruin the game
ted breathes a sigh of relief and walks the other way down the hall
he passes a door
he opens it but its just a storage closet
hes about to shut it but notices a stapler amidst the odds and ends
he hastily begins stapling his ear back on
donnys hears something and turns to look
we think hes about to get up but he then settles back in
angle back on ted who puts on last staple in
satisfied he exits the closet and continues down the hall
ted looks around and spots a phone on the counter
he jumps up grabs the handset and jumps back down
he dials johns number
john is walking back to the midtown hotel
after a beat loris car pulls up slowly alongside him
she leans over
kinda late to be walkin home by yourself
oh ill be okay
if i get raped itll be my fault with what im wearing
theres something i wanna say to you too
he pauses then gets into the car and sits down next to her
she prepares to speak but johns phone rings
he shuts it off without looking at it
ted nervously holds the phone to his ear
john i just want you to know that
i mean i hope you dont think that johns phone rings
he looks down at it annoyed
it reads unknown caller
he silences it
i just feel like we should
because johns phone rings again
exasperated he answers it
whoever this is its not a good time
can you hear me
lori sighs slightly annoyed
listen i gotta call you back
dont hang up im in trouble
what do you mean what kinda trouble
lori turns slightly curious but still annoyed
they got me
that freaky guy and his freaky fat kid
im in their house john
you gotta call the police they wont let me outta here
they tore my ear off
wait slow down
where are you
im not sure its uh suddenly a hand grabs the phone away from ted
he gasps and looks up
its donny who slams the phone back down in its cradle
dark brewing rage youre not a very polite guest
whats the matter is he all right
i dont know
where is he
i dont know but hes in trouble
can you call him back
no its blocked wait a second
john scrambles for his wallet
he opens it and pulls out the address given to him earlier by donny at the common
he looks at it then points out the window
take columbus to herald and get on the expressway
loris car peels out and races off
donny stands over ted
youve put us in a pickle here havent you
we have to go now
yeah good idea
ted runs through donnys legs and out into the hall
he races for the living room and the exit but robert steps in front of the door blocking him
robert turns the deadbolt on the door locking it
ted turns and bolts in the other direction back down the hallway but sees donny heading for him
ted ducks into the dining room as donny lunges for him and misses
donny pursues ted around the table
ted ducks under the table under the chairs etc
trying to escape donny and robert who has entered the room
ted slips past them and back out into the hall
he races for the door but the deadbolt is too high to reach
he runs into the living room and pushes open a door
ted tumbles down the dark stairs into the basement which is lit only by a single bulb hanging from the ceiling
he lands gets his bearings then freezes in shock as he sees that the basement is loaded with ripped and mutilated teddy bears
donny and robert move in to frame behind him
we tried to make do with other teddy bears
but none of them were you ted
ted whirls around in shock as we cut to john and lori race through the streets of boston
its this creepy fucked up guy who wants ted for his creepy fucked up son
they got him somehow
the car makes a hard left
john finishes punching numbers into his cellphone
i need the police right away
this guy took my teddy bear
loris car speeds away
donny and robert emerge from the house
donny clutches the sack
we can see it move as ted struggles to get free
robert gets in the back seat of the car as donny opens the way back door and dumps ted inside
ted tumbles out of the sack and into the way back
donny slams the door
he gets into the car
robert seat belt
robert buckles up
donny pulls away down the alley
ted scrambles to his feet
john looks around frantically then spots something out of the passengers side window
johns pov they pass the alley where we see donnys car heading out of the alleyway
whoa whoa stop stop stop
the car slows down and john sees donnys car make the turn out onto the street
ted is looking out the back
robert and donny both hear this
donny looks in his side view mirror just in time to see loris car swing a u turn to pursue them
donny speeds up and races off up the street
loris car speeds up in pursuit
we do several quick cuts as the chase blasts its way through the boston streets avoiding traffic and pedestrians
donnys car races through the tunnel
loris car pursues
ted continues to stare out the back
he then notices a crowbar on the floor in the way back
he grabs it and takes a hard swing at the rear window
it does not break
robert sees this and scrambles to undo his seat belt
come on were losing him
lori speeds up
ted takes another swing at the window
the glass does not break
robert undoes his seat belt and scrambles back
he grabs ted who drops the crowbar
he starts to pull ted back over into the back seat but ted manages to wriggle free
the chase continues
ted grabs the crowbar and again takes a swing at the window
this time it shatters
he drops the crowbar and climbs up onto the edge of the window
they see ted in the window
ted gets one leg and one arm up onto the edge of the window when suddenly he is whacked hard in the side of the head sending him tumbling onto
we see that robert has struck him hard with the crowbar
holding head in pain aaaaa
they continue watch with held breath as they keep up
ted shakes himself off still a little dazed and climbs back up
robert climbs into the way back and grabs one of his legs
youre being bad
ted reaches down and grabs the crowbar with one arm and brandishes it threateningly at robert
back off susan boyle
robert backs off in fear
ted climbs out onto the rear of the car and positions himself to make the jump
he tosses the crowbar away into the tunnel
john and lori speed up getting closer to him so he can make the jump
loris car moves closer to donnys
theres a tense moment with some back and forth cutting
and then ted makes the jump
he lands on the hood of loris car and slides across grabbing the windshield wiper to avoid falling off
he pulls himself back up
john and lori breathe energetic sighs of relief
john and lori laugh
fuckin a right
donny sees whats happening in his side mirror
he puts his foot on the brakes and the car screeches as it drastically reduces speed
johns car slams into donnys causing ted to go flying back through open rear window of donnys car past robert who is still in the way back and tumbling into
the back seat
ted gets his bearings and notices the sack that donny captured him in lying on the floor
he looks up at donny for a beat then grabs the sack
angle on donny driving
suddenly ted jumps up from behind and throws the sack over donnys head bracing himself against the back of the front seat
donny yells in anger and pulls at ted trying to get him off
donnys car scrapes against the side of the tunnel sending sparks flying
donny grabs ted and flings him off his face onto the floor on the passengers side
donny rips the sack off his head and reacts as he looks out the front window
hes approaching the end of the tunnel and there is opposing traffic moving in the other direction
donny swerves past the traffic narrowly avoiding clipping one of the cars
a moment later john and lori come racing out of the tunnel
however a truck drives through the intersection stopping them in their tracks
she pounds on the steering wheel frantically willing the truck to get out of the way
finally it does and they continue on into the city
donnys car races through the streets pursued by john and lori who are catching up again but are still a ways behind
ted is still on the floor on the passengers seat side
he looks around and spots a club underneath the seat
he glances at donny whose eyes are on the road
ted grabs the club and scrambles up the seat taking a swing at donny
donny ducks out of the way and tries to slap ted away as ted continues to takes swings at him
a few of them land eventually drawing blood
donny smacks ted away
ted tumbles back onto the passengers seat
then with determination he grabs the club again scurries in front of donny and locks the club onto the steering wheel with a snap
donnys eyes widen as ted scrambles into the back seat
donny tries to turn the wheel but cant
donnys car swerves out of control veering up the street and crashing into a lamppost fishtailing as it impacts
the airbags go off as the car comes to a stop
taking advantage of the situation ted scrambles out the back window
he catches his fur on a jagged shard of glass slightly ripping his side
he hangs and struggles for a bit then drops to the ground
he sways a bit
teds pov we see that his vision is swimming slightly
that little rip has done something
he shakes it off and runs up the sidewalk
angle on donny who scrambles out of the wrecked car followed by robert
they chase ted up the street
ted spots a garage with the door slightly open
he squeezes himself underneath and disappears inside
angle on john and lori they screech to a stop behind donnys car
they hurry out just in time to see donny and robert duck underneath the door
they run up the sidewalk after them
ted runs down a ramp looking frantically around for an escape route
he darts off to the left sprinting up a ramp followed by donny and robert
ted stops at a red metal fence and squeezes through rushing up the stairs on the other side
donny reaches the fence but with his larger size he has to climb over the top which slows him down a bit
angle on john and lori we catch them ducking in through the garage door and running inside
they look around for a beat
angle on robert who turns and sees them donny has already made it over the fence
angle back john and lori turn just in time to see robert charging at them
you cant have my teddy bear
when robert reaches john john knocks him down with one punch to the face
lori and john look down at him
oh my god
sorry someone had to go joan crawford on that kid
john and lori run up the ramp leaving a stunned robert behind
when they reach the red fence they look around but its unclear which way ted and donny have gone
john continues up the ramp in the wrong direction with lori just behind him
ted runs as fast as his stubby legs will carry him
donny is in pursuit and getting closer
the chase moves past a concession area and up a few flights of stairs
ted runs out onto the upper level and stops
the camera pivots degrees and ascends to reveal the expanse of fenway park down below
a few lights are on and one lone maintenance man sweeps the dirt
donny emerges from the stairwell which snaps ted out of it
ted sprints past the front row of seats and comes to a dead end
he has nowhere else to go
with donny closing in ted scurries out onto the ledge and pulls himself up onto the lighting tower
he looks down
from teds pov its a long drop
donny reaches out to grab him but cant quite reach
donny glances down at the drop for a beat then pulls himself out onto the ledge to go after ted
ted climbs farther up the tower
john and lori emerge and continue to look around frantically
they run up the walkway
donny pursues ted up the tower
john and lori emerge into the lower seating section and run down the aisle looking around with desperation
spotting the action on the look
john turns and sees the drama playing out on the distant lighting tower
what are you he turns and runs back up the aisle toward the concession area
ted is starting to gain ground but he slips and falls back down
hes about to pulls himself up again when donny grabs one of his legs
john continues up the aisle as fast as he can move
ted struggles to pull himself from donnys grasp but he cant
close up on teds side the small rip from earlier begins to tear again
close up on teds face his eyes go wide and for a moment his face freezes with fear
teds pov his vision swims a bit more
he knows this is not good
john reaches the top of the lower seating area and sprints past the concession bar heading for the stairs
the struggle continues
as ted tries to pull himself free the rip gets bigger
he reacts again and again we see his vision swimming even more
john runs up the stairwell
the struggle continues
ted tries to pull himself up but hes visibly weakened and his hands are slipping
john continues up the stairwell
ted manages to pull free from donny
he uses all his depleted strength to pull himself farther up
john runs past the top of the stairwell and sprints over toward the lighting tower just in time to see
donny makes one final reach for ted
he grabs ted by the foot again and pulls hard
with one great rrriiiiiip ted tears into two pieces
as john watches in shock ted falls through the air in slo motion a shower of white stuffing descending with him
lori watches with a hand over her mouth
the two halves of ted land along with the scattered white stuffing
donny still hanging stares down at the fallen teddy bear
he starts pulling himself back over the ledge
we lead and follow john as he runs back down through the stadium with desperate numbness
lori climbs over the edge of the seating area and runs toward him as well
angle back on donny who pulls himself back over into the upper seating area
he hears the sound of a cop siren and peers over the edge of the stadium
seeing a cop car pull up far below he makes a break for it
down below teds top half lies on the grass looking around in a daze like a badly wounded soldier for whom there is not much hope
john and lori race to his side and kneel down
oh my god
weak slow breathing johnny
ted looks glassy eyed for a beat
john starts to frantically gather up the chunks of stuffing
lori get the stuffing
get it all
lori starts helping him desperately grabbing chunks of the white cotton
john leans back over ted
youre gonna be okay buddy
youre gonna be fine
jesus i look like the robot from aliens
no look at me buddy
i promise youre gonna be okay
i dont think so
im in trouble
i need to tell you something
what is it

shes the most important
most important part of your life
even more than me

shes ted closes his eyes
angle directly above ted as we pull away and it starts to rain
the rain is pouring now
loris car pulls up
she and john hurry out john holding the remains of ted
they race inside
john and lori burst in with the remains of ted
theyre both drenched from the rain
lori frantically searches drawers for sewing materials
she finds a needle and thread and john puts ted on the table
lori starts to sew him up as john watches intently
i dont know if this is gonna just try
she continues sewing until she is all finished
ted still does not move
john and lori lower their heads
john sits on the couch head in hands
ted still lies on the coffee table
lori enters with a blanket and drapes it around him
she sits down next to him bringing part of the blanket around herself
she places a hand on his shoulder
you did everything you could
im just so sorry
she gently puts an arm around him
there is a thunderclap outside
john does not react
almost too softly to be youre not afraid
angle on ted shortly after as a white sofa blanket is placed over him
john and lori shut off the lights and exit
john is asleep but we see that lori is still lying awake
she sighs restlessly and gets up
she walks over to the window and looks out
angle upward we see a cloudy sky much like the one from that night when john was a child
as before there is a small clear patch in the center
a shooting star whizzes by through the opening
loris eyes widen a bit in recognition
she stares at the shooting star for a beat then closes her eyes and makes a wish
john wakes up looks around groggily then remembers
he gets out of bed and walks toward the living room
he pauses for a beat
and walks in
the blanket is where it was left
john slowly removes it
ted is still motionless
john lowers his head sadly
suddenly teds eyes snap open
im alive johnny
oh my god
your magical wish worked
i mean when you sewed me up you put some of the stuffing in the wrong places so im a little fucked up
will you take care of me forever and ever
john stares at him confused
nah im just kiddin ya i thought itd be funny if you thought i was fuckin retarded
john grabs him and hugs him
she sees whats happening and a huge smile crosses her face
welcome back ted
john turns to lori and realizes
it was you

smiling speechless son of a bitch

she smiles at him

john and lori kiss as we pull away
and so john lori and ted lived happily ever after having discovered at last that all they really needed was each other

ted waves happily to john who waves back
john and lori run down the aisle joyfully passing pews full of people from the movie loris co workers johns co workers guy sitting with his boyfriend alix and tanya
john and lori come running out of the church as the crowd throws rice at them
they run to a waiting limo with a just married sign on the back
john gets in and lori turns to throw the bouquet toward gina michelle tracy and tanya
tanya catches it
she turns and smiles at alix
then suddenly tami lynn bursts into frame punching tanya in the jaw

jones watching with a smile as his best friend heads off
