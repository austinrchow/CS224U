b if window
href b b written by jack bernstein tom shadyac jim carrey a ups man with a big pot belly is walking down the street whistling and carelessly tossing a package
in the air
we hear the sound of broken glass in the box
he passes a professional woman
good morning ups
he tosses the box behind his back like a basketball then acknowledges another passerby
ups good to see you
he takes a couple of steps then flings the package incredibly high into the air spins completely around and expertly drops to one knee and catches the box
a hispanic man passes
uo pay essay
the ups man dodges a couple of black kids as though playing basketball
he runs up the front steps of the building
he reaches out to open the front door and inadvertently flings the package behind him and back down the steps
he goes back retrieves the package then enters the building
several people stand in the elevator
the ups man just makes it but the door closes on the package
he feigns embarrassment
elevator doors open
the ups man throws the package out onto the floor and starts kicking it down the hall like a soccer player
with one last big kick the parcel lands in front of apartment b
he picks it up and knocks on the door
we hear a small dog barking
shut the hell up you stupid mutt
an angry burly man pokes his nose hairs out the chained door
what do you want
and how are you this afternoon
the man grumpily unchains the door
hes a big guy and of that is chest hair
a small shiatsu stands beside him
i have a package for you
the ups guy thrusts the package toward the man
we can clearly hear broken glass inside
the man takes the package
it sounds broken
most likely sir
i bet it was something nice though
i haver an insurance form
if youll just sign here here and here and initial here and print your name here well get the rest of the forms out to you as soon as we
the man begrudgingly begins to fill out the form
the dog wags his tail and whines
we can see that he likes the ups guy
thats a lovely dog you have
do you mind if i pet him sir
mumbles i dont give a rats ass
the ups man bends down and talks to the dog in a really sucky pet talk
oo ja boo ba da boo boo do booo
under breath brother
before the gruff man can finish the ups man stands back up and takes the form again
thats fine sir
i can fill out the rest
you just have yourself a good day
take care now
bye bye then
the ups man moves swiftly down the hall and into the stair well
the gruff man shakes the box tosses it down and sits in front of the tv
the ups man bursts from the front door and hustles down the street very quickly
he passes several people
quickly ups scuse me
ups comin through
we see the back of the shiatsu staring at the crack in the front door
he has not moved an inch
the gruff man looks over
get away from the door
the dog doesnt budge and this really pisses him off
he gets up and heads for the dog
whats the matter with you i said he roughly picks the dog up by the scruff of the neck but as he turns it around we see that it is
a stuffed dog
around its neck is a business card that reads you have been had by ace ventura pet detective
he breathes fire
son of a bitch
he smashes the dog to the ground
as the ups man ace rounds the corner his shirt opens up at his pot belly and the shiatsus head sticks out
ace is gloating
announcers voice that was a close one ladies and gentlemen
unfortunately in every contest there must be
he jumps into an old beat up chevy bel air and lets the dog out onto the passenger seat
he then pulls open the cars ashtray and to the dogs delight its filled with puppy chow
he tries to start the engine but it wont turn over
the dog shoots him a look
to dog no problem it gets flooded
well just wait a few seconds
ace sits back
from aces pov we see a baseball bat shatter the front windshield
or we could try it now
ace frantically tries to start the car
his new friend continues around the car beating the living shit out of it
we see the creep wailing on the car in aces side view mirror
assholes are closer than they appear
the dog is barking insanely
to dog you think you can do better
the baseball bat is now pummeling the trunk
wanna give me a push while youre back there
the back window shatters
then the cars engine roars to life
ace leaves the bad guy in a cloud of dust and gravel screaming bloody murder
ace and his new pal speed away freely
close on the happy dog hanging his head out the car window
pan across the broken windshield to ace also hanging his head out the window to see where hes going
the car drives by a sign on a telephone pole reward with a picture of the shiatsu in aces seat
a very sexy woman is hugging and kissing the shiatsu
my little baby
you missed mommy didnt you
did daddy hurt you
i wont let him no i wont
he may have kept the big screen tv but hes not gonna keep my baby
no he isnt
very sexy to ace thank you mr
how can i ever repay you
she slinks over to ace and puts her arms around his neck
well the reward would be good and there was some damage to my she cuts ace off with a devastating kiss
would you like me to take you pants off instead
she pulls him toward the bedroom
it takes a big man to stand up to my husband
hes already put two of my lovers in the hospital
how did he find out
does he have you followed
i tell him she plants a kiss on aces neck and pulls him down out of frame onto the bed
the stands are empty but theres plenty happening on the field
the miami dolphins are practicing
dan marino is in top form hitting pass after pass
behind one of the goal posts the teams mascot a rare dolphin snowflake wearing is practicing his routine
the trainer is dressed like a quarterback
snowflake swims over snatches a small football out of the trainers hand and does an end zone dance on his tail
he then returns the ball to the trainer
the trainer now sets the ball on the dolphins tail and snowflake kicks a perfect field goal
the trainer blows a whistle and raises both arms
the stadium is now completely empty
snowflake peacefully swims around his tank
suddenly the water is illuminated by the headlights of an n
the rear door slides open
two men jump out in wet suits
they slip into the water while a third waits outside the tank
snowflake surfaces to check out the action
one of the men holds out a fish
snowflake eagerly takes it then shudders as a large syringe is stuck into his back
snowflake thrashes around
quick cut of a hand with the blur of a ring slamming against the tank
but the needle has done its job
snowflake quickly goes limp
snowflake is loaded into the back of the truck
move in on snowflakes face
his excited cackle has turned into a painful whimper
the truck skids away passing the guard gate
the guard is hog tied and gagged struggling to free himself
close up on a dead goldfish laying on a newspaper
we pull back to reveal adelle rosenberg the seventy year old owner of a cluttered pet shop
shes handing a live goldfish in a bag to jennifer a very sweet nine year old
here you go honey
this kind of fish doesnt like it in the freezer
but whats gonna happen to dolly
dont worry ill make sure she gets a proper burial
adelle calls to her cat and tosses it the goldfish
the cat catches it in mid air
rest in peace
ace enters the pet shop
it looks like he slept in his clothes
here comes another dead fish
what time do you get off
suggestively ive heard some pretty great things about your kibble
well i hope im not getting a reputation
switching to mock anger just get me the food
she chuckles at ace as she loads a couple of bags with different kinds of pet food
ahh when can i expect you to pay your tab
im a little bit sli pickins right now im a little tight squeeze louise a little welfare wolly potless pissing pete im ah if you were a horse id shoot
just take it
im good for it adelle
im on a very big case right now
ace reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out a flyer with a picture of a white pigeon
see this pigeon
its a true albino
some rich guy lost it
hes offering a ten thousand dollar reward
wow albino pigeons are very rare
how are you going to find him
just keep my eyes open and hope to god it doesnt snow
ace grabs his bags and heads for the door
youre a good boy ace
a good boy
he holds the door open for an elderly gentleman who is entering at the same time
the gentleman is walking a toy poodle on a leash
the poodle is dragging its butt along the entire length of the floor
ace and adelle just stare
in a loud voice do you have anything for ringworm
ace enters the courtyard of a two story u shaped apartment complex carrying his groceries
its a crappy joint but he calls it home
inside an open apartment on the ground floor the landlord mr
shickadance sits watching tv stuffing his face with cheese doodles
ace sneaks past the door and up the stairs
ace is just putting the key in the door when the landlord steps up behind him
ace is startled by the dreaded shickadance rasp not unlike linda blair in the exorcist
ace straightens up but doesnt turn around
now ace turns around in mock surprise
oh im sorry sir
you sounded like someone else
never mind the wise cracks venturaaa
you owe me rent
i told you youre my first priority
as soon as i find the white pigeon youre paid
i heard animals in there ventura
i heard em again this morning scratchin around
i never bring my work home with me sir
the landlord notices the bags of kibble
whats all this pet food for
the landlord isnt buying it
you wanna take a look for yourself
ace rattles his keys in the door
then he swings it open and turns on the light
the house is clear
ace walks in as the landlord stands there snooping and sniffing the air
are you satisfied
still suspicious yeah but dont ever let me catch you with an animal in there thats all
take care now
the landlord walks away as ace closes the door
quietly to himself he then turns to the room and gives a distinct whistle
animals jump out from every direction
lizards crawl out of drawers birds fly through the air all of them gravitating to ace
to his flock ooshhooboobooboodoodoo
the very imposing office of bobby riddle owner of the miami dolphins
riddle is a take charge doesnt take crap from anyone type of guy
he is yelling at roger podacter an ex linebacker in his early sixties and melissa robinson podacters attractive assistant
i just want to know one thing how the hell do you lose a pound fish
melissas about to speak but hesitates
its not a fish sir
its a mammal
an angry riddle stands up
oh thank you very much mrs
bob she didnt mean anything by it
riddle calms down a little and sits
calmer listen personally i dont give a good god damn about a fish
he looks at melissa
she doesnt dare say anything
all i care about is winning this super bowl
i want the players head in the right place
shit roger youve been in this game long enough you know how superstitious players are
our quarterbacks been putting his socks on backwards since high school
and i got a lineman who hasnt washed his jock in two years because he thinks flies are lucky
i want that god damn fish on the field super bowl sunday
an upset podacter and melissa walk through the hallway
why did it have to happen now
i got three stinking years left till retirement
ive got forty
ill tell you who did it
it was those goddamn animal rights nuts
always out there with their goddamn signs animals were born that goddamn fish lives better than they do
they stop outside melissas office by her secretarys desk
the police are checking into the animal rights people
to secretary martha have the police called back about the dolphin yet
no but i wanted to tell you when i lost my cuddles i hired a pet detective
a pet detective
thanks martha but wed better leave this to professionals
well actually he was quite good
pet detection is a very involved highly scientific process
close on ace cooing like a pigeon
widen to reveal ace precariously perched on the roof of a two story building
he is four feet away from the pigeon
ater a beat he makes a mad spastic yet scientific lunge for the bird
the bird makes a clean getaway
unable to stop his momentum ace flies past the edge of the building and slides down the side of the roof
ace crashes to the ground
as he lies face down in a heap of trash his beeper goes off
aces clunker drives by some real nice cars
employees stare at him
a stern guard is admitting people into the stadium
he scans each one with a security detection wand
the guard scans him
the guard scans him
the guard stares at ace accusingly
ventura to see you
okay send him in
martha exits ace enters
hi im melissa robinson
did you have any trouble getting in
no the guy with the rubber glove was surprisingly gentle
apologetically super bowl week
ventura ill get right to the point
she slips a tape in the vcr and gestures for ace to sit
our mascot was stolen from his tank last night
are you familiar with snowflake
the tape shows snowflake doing a trick
the trainer dressed like a quarterback shouts out signals
snowflake swims over snatches the small football out of the trainers hand swims the length of the pool does an end zone dance on his tail then returns the ball
to the trainer
we got snowflake from the miami seaquarium
hes a rare bottle nose dolphin
thats the new trick he was going to do during the half time show
while ace studies the tape he chews sunflower seeds in a bird like fashion placing the shells in a neat little pile on her desk
would you like an ashtray
no i dont smoke
he adds more shells to the pile
melissa is already wondering if she has made a mistake
to be honest mr
im pretty skeptical
before today i didnt even know there was such a thing as a pet detective
well now that you do youll know who to call if your schnauser ever runs away
how did you know i have a schnauser
ace pulls a invisible to the naked eye dog hair off here blouse and presents it to her
hes young about five pounds black coat white speckles
sniffs the hair likes to chase cars
you should see what i can do with a good stool sample
i can hardly wait
look weve got a problem
can you help me or not
coy well sea faring creatures arent really my expertise
well give you three thousand dollars on delivery
ace immediately becomes the narrator of a nature show
the dolphin is a social creature
capable of complex communication
traveling in large groups or schools
the dolphin players practice
a crowd of reporters interview marino
we just choked in
we had a chance to win it and we didnt
nobodys gonna choke this time and if they do ill kill em
ace and melissa head for snowflakes tank
the police were here this morning
apparently the kidnappers used the back gate
ace bends down to look at some tire tracks on the field
they said some kind of a four wheel drive van
loaded from the rear
ace sniffs the turf
podacter enters nervously
oh hi roger
how are you holding up
well if it looks like im walking funny its because i have a bunch on reporters up my ass
theyve been asking me about snowflake all day
roger podacter meet ace ventura
ace is our pet detective
podacter shakes his hand
nice to meet you
martha metz recommended you very highly
oh yeah the bitch
lost in highland park area
she was half dead when i found her
is that the tank
they both follow ace as he makes a b line
the tank is empty
cops drain it
ace hops on the ladder
if im not back in five minutes
call lloyd bridges
while eating sunflower seeds ace meticulously examines the tank including the scratches where the hand banged up against the wall when snowflake was stolen
all the while he is singing a bastardized version of the theme from flipper
the flippiest flipper
podacter and melissa watching from the rim look at each other like what have we gotten ourselves into
podacter spots something
a hoard or reporters are headed their way
ill try to head them off
to ace get out of the tank
still singing cant hear you flipper flipper
lookin for flipper gotta find flipper
i said get out of the tank
the reporters draw closer
podacter heads them off
so wheres snowflake
snowflake is just ah not available right now
come on im supposed to get a shot of his new trick for the evening news
is he sick
other reporters chime in
did something happen to snowflake
whatre you hiding
melissa and podacter dont know what to say
then a strange voice is heard
unrecognizable accent how cun i be getting dis vork dun mit all da shouting
what for is dis shouting
who the hell is that

ace spits at the reporters feet
podacter jumps in
gentlemen please coach shulas press conference is just about to begin
why dont i take you over there and let ah heinz do his job
he ushers the press away
sotto to ace are you finished heinz
ace goes to the filter outside the tank opens it and pours out its contents mainly leaves small twigs and gunk
he roots through it notices a very tiny amber stone
he smiles to himself
now im finished
a flurry of activity in the detective division
as ace enters several cops taunt him on sight led by the obnoxious sergeant aguado
make any good collars lately
or were they leashes
they all bust up
aguado spots a bug on the ground
steps on the bug homicide ventura
the cops are falling all over themselves laughing
how you gonna solve this one
ace walks up to them and looks at the squashed bug
good question aguado
first id establish a motive
in this case the killer saw the size of the bugs dick and became insanely jealous
the other cops all react with a big ooooooo
aguado has no comeback
ace comes face to face with him
then id lose thirty pounds porking his wife
aguado suddenly loses it and swings at ace
with a lightening move ace sidesteps the punch and forces aguados face down next to the dead bug
now kiss and make up
ace walks off
to himself ace walks to the desk of emilio echavez a young energetic member of the homicide division
ace has a silly impish look on his face
playfully i miss you
its not a good time ace
if einhorn sees me talking to you im gonna be history
just tell me what you got on snowflake
thats all i need
i cant say anything
my hands are tied
effeminate sounds like my kind of a party
a cop comes to emilios desk
look alive einhorns on her way down
just tell me whos working the case
hes pimple juice
hes the poster child for lead paint chip eaters
were a little busy with murderers and drug dealers
a missing dolphin isnt exactly a high priority
the elevator is getting closer
ace gimme a break will ya
ace nonchalantly sits back in a chair pops a sunflower seed into his mouth and cracks it loudly
quickly okay okay
we checked all the local animal rights groups taxidermists and were running a check through dmv on all recent van rentals
so far nada
any unusual bets being made
ace its the super bowl of course theres bets being made
whatd you find out about the tank
just the tire tracks and the exit route
the guard didnt see anything
now please go away
you know something
again impish ace gets up and exits the room
then just as emilio sighs with relief ace pops back in
what about crazy philly fans
the elevator bell rings
out steps police lt
lois einhorn mid s with a slender build a great pair of legs and a bad tude
holy testicle tuesday
to emilio what the hell is he doing here
i came to confess
i was the second gunman on the grassy knoll
spare me the routine ventura
i know youre working the snowflake case
may i suggest you yield to the experts on this one
well find the porpoise
mock relief whewww
now i feel better
ace turns to go
of course that might not do any good
you see nobodys missing a porpoise
its a dolphin thats been taken
the common harbor porpoise has an abrupt snout pointed teeth and a triangular thorasic fin while the bottlenose dolphin or tursiops truncatus has an elongated beak round cone shaped teeth
and a distinctive serrated dorsal appendage
beat but im sure you already knew that
beat thats what turns me on about you
maybe ill give you a call sometime lieutenant
your number still
a wild thrasher club
an incredible thrash band is on stage cranking
kids jump wildly into the moshing pit
ace enters sees a burnout at the bar whose head is circling insanely to the music
shouting excuse me
is greg here
the burnouts head thrashes on
no acknowledgement of ace
ace heads for the basement stairs
ace descends the stairs stopping at a large steel door
ace bangs on it three times
a voice is heard from inside
i pay for sex
you can too
the door electronically unlatches and slides open
green peace save the whales posters abound
greg woodstock a laid back ex hippy with long gray hair sits at a very impressive computer set up
ace and he have their own distinct banter
a thud from above
ace looks up
part of the ceiling is made of metal grating so you can see the bottom of the dance floor
a guys face gets smashed into the grate
we see that it is the burnout from the club
to burnout found him
hows it goin
super and thank you for asking
hope youre having a nice day
and what are you up to
just watching the fishies man
there is a blip on the computer screen
alright youre just in time for the party
you see those blips
i certainly do
a map with several ships on the ocean
he quickly taps in some commands and the ships start sailing in all different directions
thats a norwegian whaling fleet
im sending them new directional coordinates
theyll find jimmy hoffa before they find any humpbacks
woodstock moves to a different screen
check this out
more computer graphics come up on the screen
just changed the formula for purinas puppy chow
turns to ace too much filler dont ya think
acting turned on im very attracted to you right now
can you still tap into all the aquatic supply store in the area
of course i can
i want to trace the sale of any equipment for transporting or housing a dolphin within the past few months
i thought you might have a challenge for me
woodstock starts hacking away
okay then try to remember the sixties
marine winch sling feeder fish gallon tank
we hear a beep
i found the culprit
who is it
dramatically sea world
hang on hang on
he taps a couple keys well what do we have here
thats a lot of equipment for a civilian
the printer spits out some data
woodstock rips off the page and hands it to ace
billionaire and rare fish collector
comes up on the computer screen
that my friend is the face of the enemy
he pages through his file on screen
always tryin to get his hands on endangered species
newspaper articles fill the screen
one shows a picture of camp and some dolphin players
hold on this guys connected with the dolphins
ace leans in
camp donated the land the new stadiums built on
re article oh look at this hes throwin another im the richest man in the universe party
i wonder if i can find myself a date
its a magnificent home
there is an extremely formal party in progress
twenty to thirty people having champagne caviar and hot air
we see dan marino sitting with an audience around him
we just choked in
we had a chance to win and we didnt
but nobodys gonna choke this time if they do ill kill em
ace and melissa climb an impressive stairway leading to camps mansion
im really going out on a limb here ventura
camps social events are strictly a list
a la love connection well chuck
the date started off good but just before we got to the party she seemed to tense up
melissa rolls her eyes then taps a huge door knocker
i swear if you do anything to embarrass me in front of camp
you mean like this
ace starts doing a spastic body convulsion
just then a bald headed butler who looks a little like gavin mccloud opens the door
ace doesnt notice until melissa hits him with her purse
he sees the butler
oh hi captain stubing
melissa storms in already pissed
ace and melissa enter
camp looks over
glad you could make it
oh and who is this
this is my date
well does he have a name or should i call him lawyer
im sorry its ace ah tom ace
ace is very unimpressed with her lying ability
he jumps in
wonderful to meet you mr
camp and congratualtions on all your success
you smell terrific
ah well thank you
please come in
ace boldly leads the way over to an hors oeuvre table
melissa closely follows
sotto this is insane
theres no way that camp stole snowflake
spreading pate on a cracker will you just keep him occupied while i work my magic please
she crosses the room
he puts the cracker in his mouth and begins to crunch
a man in a tux beside ace spreads pate on his own cracker
with a mouthful to man smooshy isnt it
off the stuffy mans reaction
ace approaches camp
excuse me ron i need to use the bathroom
palms his stomach whispering loudly i think its the pate
um its just over there
stuff probably looks better on the way out huh
ace laughs slaps camp hard on the back and heads for the bathroom
ace wastes no time
he locks the door turns on the water faucet steps onto the toilet seat opens and climbs out a window
ace drops to the ground
he follows a pathway through a gazebo and into a doorway all the time quietly singing the musical score to mission impossible
ace browses through a myriad of dramatically lit salt water tanks still singing
theyre all filled with colorful exotic fish
very impressive but nothing large enough to house a dolphin
he continues on towards a large door
a huge above ground tank is covered with curtains to discourage onlookers
ace swings open the large door and enters
ace climbs a ladder on the side of the tank singing more intensely now
the ladder leads to a narrow catwalk over the center of the water
ace grabs a feeder fish from a pail and walks carefully out there
he looks into the dark pool but sees nothing
now he stops singing quietly squats down and dangles the fish over the water
he reels back falling off the catwalk into the water
melissa is admiring some beautiful tropical fish
wonderful arent they
no matter what is going on in my life i can always watch them swim and be completely at peace
the water is still for a moment
then ace breaks the surface
frantic to himself its not snowflake
its not snowflake
instantly aces body is thrashed around back and forth through the water the entire length of the pool
screaming a line is forming outside the bathroom
camp and melissa are seated nearby
hes getting curious
are you sure hes okay
its been an awfu y long time
oh im sure hes fine
ace suddenly opens the bathroom door and stands there completely drenched from head to toe with his pants in shreds
they all stare at ace in amazement
loudly to the entire room fanning the air whewww
ace and melissa are exiting
camp stops in the doorway
still confused im very sorry mr
ill have the pluming checked immediately
be sure that you do
if i had been drinking out of that toilet i might have been killed
ace shakes camps hand and notices his ring
he holds on to get a better look
its a very distinct commemorative ring
camp wants his hand back but ace wont let go
melissa finally drags ace away
wed better go
camp looks on and shakes his head
ace is thinking
melissa is pissed
yknow i dont even want to know why your pants are missing
i dont care what happened
you could have cost me my job
on his own wavelength i was wrong about camp
hes breaking the law but hes not our guy
its a sure thing
its definitely him
just get me in there
let me work my magic
ace takes the stone out of his pocket and studies it intensely
this is the key
hiring you was the biggest mistake i ever made
yet an invaluable piece
of our twisted little jigsaw puzzle
melissa stares at ace like hes gone crazy
there is a flash of headlights and a car horn
melissa swerves back into her own lane
ace drops the stone somewhere on the seat and begins to search for it frantically
to melissa try to keep it on the road
melissa enters followed by ace
so you found a pebble in snowflakes tank
excuse me while i call cnn
i found it in the filter
and its not a pebble
it is a rare triangular cut orange amber
ace hands melissa the stone and quickly goes to one of her bookcases
what are you talking about
tonight i saw the exact same stone in camps ring
ace finds a book on the dolphin team and flips through it
i thought you said he didnt do it
his ring wasnt missing a stone
but whoever was in that tank had a ring just like his
wait a second
ace hands her the book
its open to a photo of
the dolphin afc championship ring
melissa holds the stone up to the picture
its a perfect match
i find the ring with the missing stone i find snowflake
how are you gonna do that
ace is wheezing and gasping for air as he struggles to jog up beside a large man whos running around the track at a very fast pace
when he finally catches up he awkwardly tries to catch a glimpse of the mans ring and trips
the man just keeps going
ace sits waiting with one shoe off
the store manager an ex player for the team sets down several shoe boxes
ace checks out the ring
a poster of the team
the player we just saw is being crossed out
pan a few kids getting autographs from marino and other players ending on ace dressed up and looking like a pimply kid
as the players sign he checks their rings
ace is again trying to catch the large man on the track
this time just as he draws near the man leaves him in the dust
two big guys finish arm wrestling
ace steps up to challenge
he spends an undue amount of time preparing his grip as he checks out the ring
ace finally gets set and gives the go ahead nod
he is instantly thrown across the room
the poster of the team
another group of players are being crossed out
ace spots a player driving along side him
he cant see his ring
ace deliberately cuts off the players car and flips him off
the angry player flips ace off
we see his ring is intact
ace waves and drives off
one huge lineman uses a urinal
ace using the urinal next to him nonchalantly tries to catch a glimpse of the guys hands
the lineman has a very angry look on his face but after a beat it changes to a come on smile
the poster of the team
there is only one face that has not been crossed out
ace circles it
once again we see the large fast man jogging toward camera
suddenly ace runs up behind him with a desperate look on his face pouring a bottle of chloroform into a cloth
he leaps onto the mans back smothering him with the cloth and holding on for dear life
the man slowly gives up the fight and collapses
ace casually checks the ring then walks away disappointed
ace sits in a lawn chair depressed
melissa consoles him
ace that stone could have come from anywhere
an earring a necklace
with murder in his eyes it came from an afc championship ring
einhorn thinks it was an animal rights group
have you heard of fan
free animals now
started in by chelsea gamble daughter of the famous industrialist fischer gamble
over half a million members from florida to finland
who are they
did you know that last year they sent threatening letters to college teams demanding the release of their mascots
at last count what do you feed your dog
we see melissas dog lying near aces feet
dog food why
what are you talking about
hes just very unhappy i feel sorry for him
bad diet isolated environment
its amazing hes still alive
youre just mad because your stupid pebble theory didnt work out and you dont know how to express your anger
and youre ugly
im not even gonna talk to you please leave
what so you can beat him
the phone rings inside the house
melissa goes to answer it
hiring you was a huge mistake
the door slams and ace is alone with the dog
after a moment he reaches down to pet it and we all see that it is one of the happiest dogs in the world
you like her huh
yeah shes alright
ace feeling guilty walks into the house
ace walks toward melissa
look melissa i ah
ace stops when he sees melissa
she is sitting holding the phone in her lap with a completely stunned look on her face
something is very wrong
police lights flashing paramedics crowds of people
ace and melissa see roger podacters body taken away in an ambulance
melissa nods bravely
emilio joins them
whatd you find
he was alone
hed been drinking
no sign of a struggle
neighbor heard him scream on the way down
just your classic fifteen story swan dive
ace gives emilio a way to go look
the three enter
emilio pushes the button for the elevator
it just seems so out of character
he was going to retire in two years
did he leave a note
the elevator arrives
thats nothing unusual
some do some dont
the elevator doors close
police are everywhere
emilio ace and melissa enter and are immediately approached by one of the officers
miss robinson this is officer carlson
i wonder if you could answer a few questions about the deceased
ace slips away we follow him as he eavesdrops on conversations
to a cop i told you i was across the hall in my apartment i heard a scream
the door was locked so i called the manager
the manager reiterates her story to the cop
the manager is about years old
the place was empty except for the damn dog in the other room
then i opened the balcony door looked over the railing and
splat bang pancake time
ace continuing his investigation notices
in perfect order
next he notices police coming in and out of the balcony closing the door behind them shutting out the noise
a dog is cowering in the corner
ace tries to comfort the little guy
hey fella have a bad night
ace examines its paws
ace then gets down and finds scratches in the door
two feet interrupt
he is face to face with einhorn
who let dr
emilio steps in immediately
he came with miss robinson this is official police business
well let you know if the coroner finds any ticks
i just thought since melissa e forget it
besides i wouldnt want someone tracing my steps and pointing out all the mistakes i made
ace crosses to
ace examines the area
einhorn is in hot pursuit
oh so you dont think this in an obvious suicide mr
well i wouldnt say that
lord knows there is plenty of evidence here to support your theory except of course that spot of blood on the balcony
on the railing sure enough there is a tiny spot of blood
einhorn glares at a couple of nearby cops
they look down
may i tell you what i think happened
ace moves as he talks
roger podacter went out after work
he had a few drinks and he came home
but he wasnt alone
someone was with him in this apartment
there was a struggle and then roger podacter was thrown over that balcony
roger podacter didnt commit suicide
he was murdered
a beat as everyone considers this
well thats a very entertaining story but real detectives have to worry about that little thing lawyers call evidence
ace picks up a lottery ticket on podacters desk and becomes a condescending kid show host
lets take a trip to clue corner shall we
can anyone tell me why a man buys a lottery ticket on the day he is going to commit suicide
or why the family pet suffering from acute canine trauma clawed at the bedroom door until his paws bled
how about the blood on the railing
ill bet if we put our thinking caps on well see that it was the result of the struggle that took place inside this apartment while mr
podacter was still alive
singing everyone looks to einhorn
not a bad try for a pet detective but not near conclusive enough for us real investigators
beat first people buy lottery tickets everyday
its a habit
it doesnt prove a thing
second the dog wasnt suffering from canine trauma he was suffering from bladder trauma
sergeant neilson found a piss stain as big as lake huron near the bed
and third the blood on the railing
he doesnt jump far enough and whacks his head
a fact confirmed by the paramedics who found cuts on his scalp with traces of a white chalky substance
plaster from the balcony
einhorn shows ace the paramedics report
everyone is impressed with einhorn
so much for your murder ventura
uh oh i think i heard a toilet flush
maybe someone lost their turtle
everyone has a laugh
ace looks beaten
well maybe im just a little out of my league here
ace holds out his hand einhorn shakes it
ace and melissa head for the door
oh there is just one more thing lieutenant
re the neighbor this man is roger podacters neighbor
he lives across the hall
he said he heard a scream is that right sir
the neighbor nods
ace turns to the apartment manager
and you said you had to open the balcony door when you keyed into the room
ace walks out onto the balcony and turns facing them
youre certain you had to open this door
whats the point ventura
ace sustains an incredible pavorati note while he repeatedly opens and closes the glass door between them
when the door is closed nothing can be heard
tapping the door this is double paned sound proofed glass
theres no way this neighbor could have heard podacter scream on the way down with this door shut
the scream he heard came from inside this apartment before podacter was thrown over the railing
and the muderer closed the door before he left
celebrates insanely yes
i have exorcised the demons
a la poltergeist this house is clear
ace drives straight ahead
what are you thinking
im thinking this whole thing is connected somehow
frustrated im thinking i want to find that other ring
you checked all the rings
i know pessimistress
could anyone else have gotten a ring that year
camp was the only honoree
just players and coaches
everyone in the photo
there must be receipts
you have a key to the office
ace this has been a really tough day
cant we do this in the morning
ace looks at his watch
aces car screeches to a stop in front of the building
ace jumps out followed by melissa
team pictures adorn the walls
these files go back to seventy eight
ace is flipping through a file cabinet looking at receipts
melissa is starting to warm to him
that was pretty impressive what you did back at the apartment
still looking you dont have to tell me
i was there
maybe you should have joined the police force
become a real detective
shaking his head i dont do humans
melissa gets a bit closer
you really love animals dont you
ace stops searching and looks into her eyes
i feel a kinship with them
i understand them
wanna hear something kinda spooky
she gets closer still
one time when i was about twelve i had this dream that i was being followed by a dog with rabies
he had these really bloodshot eyes and foam coming out of his mouth
and just before i got to my front door
he jumped on me and sunk his teeth in
then i woke up and felt the back of my neck
check this out
ace motions for melissa to feel the back of his neck but when she does he snaps at her hand barking like a vicious dog
melissa jumps out of her skin
snickering im sorry
i couldnt stop myself
are these all the receipts
mildly annoyed i dont know
theres only a dozen of them here
ace turns from the file cabinet with a hopeless look on his face
melissa begins to clean up his mess
maybe they were misplaced because somebody didnt put the files back when he was
who the hell is that
ace crosses to a big picture of the team that hangs on the aadjacent wall and points out a player
who the hell is that
he quickly pulls out his crossed out pictures of the team and begins to compare the two
oh thats ray finkle
dont you know who ray finkle is
how come hes not in this picture
melissa checks aces photo
this was the picture you were using
this was taken earlier in the year
finkle wasnt added to the roster till mid season
she starts to realize what ace has already figured out
hes the guy that missed the final field goal in the super bowl that year
cost the dolphins the game
but he got a ring
ace and melissa look through finkles file on a microfiche screen
newspaper articles headshots flash before them
replacement kicker having great year
ready for super bowl confident kicker boasts
field goal sails wide dolphins lose super bowl
the kick heard round the world
that was finkle
the dolphins lost by one point
another headline hits the screen finkle contract not renewed
poor guy with a motive baby
where is he now
last i heard he went back to his home town collier county
he used to work in a bar up there
pondering can you drop me off before you go
shaking his head no way
it may not be safe at your apartment and you shouldnt be left alone
what do you suggest
we see a persons butt under a sheet coming up into frame repeatedly
skin sweat sheets fly as ace and melissa roll back and forth on the bed
ace is taking no prisoners
animals at the bottom of the bed with eyes as big as silver dollars watching them silently
we cut back and forth between furious lovemaking and shots of staring animals
melissa and ace simultaneously reach the pinnacle of pleasure
totally amazed and exausted oh man
mock embarrassment im sorry
thats never happened to me before
i must be tired
various traveling shots of ace en route to a deliverance type town deep in the everglades
a sign reads gas food miles but the word food is crossed out
a pitifully sad country song plays on the radio
fern bilbo sits at his cluttered desk with the end of an old shotgun in his mouth
he is struggling to reach the trigger
through the glass behind him we see aces car pull up to the only gasoline pump
the bell rings
fern begrudgingly takes the gun out of his mouth sets it down and walks out
ace gets out of his car
excuse me sir
do you know where i can find the pigskin sports bar
do i have a kick me sign on my back son
i wouldnt know anything about that but if you could point me toward the bar
fern breaks down sobbing
they all left me
all of them
hypothetically speaking say they all left you and went to the pigskin sports bar
how would they have gotten there from here
two miles down and take the first left
thanks very much
take care now bye bye then
ace gets into his car and pulls out
fern enters sits down at the desk places the end of the shotgun in his mouth reaches for the trigger and
another car pulls up to the pump
exasperated he takes the gun out of his mouth
murmers to himself as he gets up cant get anything done around here
a weathered dive in the middle of a swamp
if depression had a home this is it
several dejected men with various degrees of missing teeth sit around the bar
a couple hapless guys play pool
one throws darts
ace enters pops a sunflower seed in his mouth and addresses the room
excuse me guy
my name is ace ventura im a pet detective
id like to ask you a few questions if i could
no one even looks at him
just a few questions thats all
still no one reacts
very up who wants gum
again no reaction
ace walks over to the bartender and slides a five across the bar
im looking for a guy who used to work here
the bartender takes the money
he was a kicker for the dolphins
a pool ball flies by aces head shattering a mirror behind the bar
all eyes are on ace
to guy who threw it that would be a scratch
you a friend of finkles
the giant guy smashes his bottle
sorry i have say the opposite of what you mean disease
several undesirables surround ace
that bastard ruined this town
i hate that
we bet everything we had on that super bowl and that son of a bitch gagged
what a diiick
they all move closer in a threatening manner
shanked a goddamn yarder
death to finkle
death to finkle
the bartender steps in
we had a hell of a thing going here
tourists coming to see ray finkles home town
he was standing right over there when he got the call from the dolphins
the bartender points to a payphone
it has had the shit beaten out of it
every expletive you can think of is graffitied around it
did he come back after the super bowl
but the boys here had ways of letting him know he wasnt welcome
excuse me i gotta take a wicked finkle
whats the difference between finkle and a jackass
a jackass can kick
why did finkle cross the road
i know this one
and ive got the hair on my bumper to prove it
maniacal laughter and chanting ensues
its good youre dealing with the anger
beat i dont suppose anyones seen him lately
the chanting stops and the guys all look at ace
but we know where his parents live
dont we boys
we sure do
they all laugh insanely again
ace pulls up outside a two story stilt house
the place has been completely desecrated by graffiti bullet holes and paint bombs
toilet paper is strewn through the trees
ace walks up and knocks on the door
a wooden peephole slides open revealing a suspicious pair of eyes
hi im looking for ray finkle
a gun slides out into aces face
with a gulp and a clean pair of shorts
a deep gruff voice from inside
what do you know about ray finkle
southpaw soccer style kicker
graduated from collier high in june
stetson university honors graduate class of
holds two ncaa division one records
one for most points in a season one for distance
former nickname the mule
the first and only pro athlete ever to come out of collier county
and one helluva model american
after a beat the peephole closes
the door slowly creaks open revealing mr
finkle an unsmiling taciturn elderly man holding the gun
are you another one of them scumbags from hard copy
im just a very big finkle fan
this is my graceland sir
finkle a sweet adorable elderly woman comes over
will you put that gun down
the boys a fan of our son
so nice to meet you
im rays mother and this is rays father
its a real honor
my ray is so appreciative of his fans
hell be so pleased you stopped by
are you expecting ray anytime soon
i expect him home any minute
ace is surprised
would you like some cookies
i just baked them
finkle hurries off to the kitchen
ace smiles at mr
the guys a corpse
ray finkles house
cant wait to meet him
ray aint comin home
but your wife said you expect him home any minute
she expects him home any minute
he points to his head and looks toward the kitchen
engines runnin but theres no one behind the wheel
ten years ago our son escaped from shady acres psychiatric hospital in tampa
theyre still buggin us to pick up his stuff
finkle returns with a plate of football shaped cookies
sweetly it was all that dan marinos fault everyone knows that
if he had held the ball laces out like youre supposed to ray would never have missed that kick
dan marino should die of gonorrhea and rot in hell
would you like a cookie son
ace takes a cookie
holding it up
hey what do ya know
theyre little footballs
a large stone smashes through the window
outside a pickup truck filled with drunken patrons from the pigskin sports bar drives by yelling their finkle chant
i told you he had a lot of fans
finkle picks up the rock and hurls it out the broken window
it hits one of the vandals knocking him out cold as the truck peels away
aside to ace she got the arm
the boy got the leg
finkle and ace are walking down the hallway to rays room
when ray gets back and starts kicking again hell never even know he was gone
i kept his room just the way he left it
she opens the door to rays room
ace steps in
its a death shrine to dan marino
complete with lifesize cutouts of dan marino some with nooses around the neck other hacked to pieces
painted on the walls death to marino
marino must die
what a sports nut huh
in the center of the room is a movie projector
by all means
finkle shuts the lights off
ace turns on the projector
the film flickers over the marino must die
its the final play of the super bowl
marino takes the snap finkle kicks and the ball sails wide
the film repeats itself ad infinitum
ace on the payphone
we see the gas station in the background
melissa its ace
where are you
im in psychoville and finkles the mayor
wheres dan marino
because hes about to join snowflake
i gotta know where he is
okay hold on
melissa checks marinos itinerary
ace waits impatiently
to himself come on
in the background we see two paramedics exit the gas station office rolling a dead body on a gurney
the area of the sheet that covers the face is a giant red spot
we widen to see them load good old mr
bilbo into an ambulance and drive away ringing the station bell one more time
ace doesnt notice
ah he had practice
he has a commercial shoot out at the prescott sound stage
where is that
its on route one by the six cut off
thirty minutes outside of town
okay thats about fifteen miles from me
call the police
get extra security over there now
ace tell me whats going on
the payphone dangles off the hook
in his car racing out of the swampland his heaad now back out the window so he can see
he leaves a faded old barely legible sign in his wake the f in finkle has been replaced with st in spray paint
rehearsal for an isotoner ad in progress
so i protect the hands that protect me
marino gets carted off by five huge linemen
remember exit camera right
thats to your left
alright lets get ready to shoot this
to the linemen helmets on this time
the linemen disperse
ace runs a red light causing cars to skid in every direction
marino is in the make up chair
to make up girl see in we just choked
we had a chance to win it and we didnt dan are you ready
to girl ill tell you later
the cops race onto the lot
marino takes center stage
quiet on the set
hi im dan marino
if anyone knows the value of protection its me
we see an old clip of marino getting sacked
cops scramble on foot to the sound stage
the commercial is winding up
the linemen ready themselves
so i protect the hands that protect me
the five linemen grab marino and run off camera
that was good
again from one
but two of the linemen keep running with marino
i said cut
and they keep running
what the hell are they doing
right out the studio door
then the cops arrive and race after them
two linemen stumble out of the dressing room holding their heads
ace skids around a corner looking way up ahead
he sees marino being shoved into a black ford bronco
they drive off
the cops come out of the building on foot
ace in hot pursuit almost runs the cops down
yelling at cops scuse meee
aces head is out the drivers window through the entire chase
as he starts gaining on the bad guys they start shooting
ace wisely puts his head inside the car
he cant see shit through his broken windshield
he pokes his head out again
they shoot again
ace swerves off the road into
aces car smashes through benches and tables
then it flips over a few times and lands on its wheels with a horrid smash
ace is still strapped into the drivers seat unconscious
aces prized white pigeon lands on the car door right beside him
ace cracks his eyes and sees the bird
then with a sudden quick lunge he successfully traps it in his hands and forgets all about marino
i did it
i did it
i caught the white pigeon
i caught the white pigeon
ace jumps out of his car and starts skipping around the park with the pigeon held high over his head
he looks insane
singing i caught the white pigeon i caught the white pigeon i caught the white
ace slows down and begins to look around warily
there are now an unusual number of birds perched on the telephone wires around the park and on the monkey bars and on the swings
the sky grows darker
he slowly turns and tries to get back to the car
all the birds take flight
ace sets the white pigeon free and starts to run but its too late
the birds are on him
pecking and gouging and ripping his flesh
now we see ten birds flying away with a leg
five birds flying away with an arm
twenty others are trying to take aces left arm off and half his face is missing
ace is back in his wrecked car with his arm hanging out the window
a small boy is pulling it
ace come to suddenly and looks at the boy with a crazed expression
that was a really neat crash mister
do it again
ace sighs with relief
various headlines hit the news stands marino kidnapped star qb missing dan the globe headline marino abducted by alien franchise
on the cover marino stands with several space aliens in football gear
a chaotic press conference
zillions of reporters shout all kinds of questions at einhorn
lieutenant have there been any ransom demands
theres been no communication with the kidnappers at this time
whats going to happen to the super bowl
will it be postponed
as of now the game is going on as scheduled
why wasnt the public told about snowflakes kidnapping
secrecy was essential
we didnt want any public interference
are the crimes related
and what about roger podacters murder
i cant comment any further
now if youll excuse me
einhorn pushes her way through the crowd of reporters
einhorn is barking out orders to other cops as she heads for her office
emilio get me the autopsy on podacter
aguado send out a memo
no one talks to the press
and somebody get me a cup of coffee
tv announcers voice tonight on miami vice crockett geets the boss coffee
ace is in her office popping sunflower seeds kicking back
einhorn walks to her private bathroom
ventura when i get out of this bathroom you better be gone
is it number one or number two
einhorn turns and glares at ace
i just want to know how much time i have
einhorn goes to the sink and begins washing her hands
oh by the way i went ahead and solved that pesky snowflake podacter marino thing
humoring him oh yeah
yeah ever hear of a former dolphin kicker named ray finkle
the water shuts off
einhorn appears around the corner
make it quick
i found a rare stone at the bottom of snowflakes tank
its from a dolphin afc championship ring
it would have been a super bowl ring but ray finkle missed the big kick
blames the whole thing on marino
were talking paranoid delusional psychosis
i saw the guys room
cozy if youre hannibal lector
so how does roger podacter fit in
my guess is finkle was snooping around
podacter recognized him
end of story
as for snowflake
they gave him finkles number and taught him how to kick a field goal
finkle took it personally
einhorn listens with great interest
so where is finkle now
he broke out of a metal hospital
did a claude raines
hes been planning his revenge for years
waiting for the perfect time to get back at the dolphins
the time when it would hurt them the most
super bowl time
man im tired of being right
einhorn walks in front and sits on the edge of the desk
shes totally softened her demeanor
youve done some fine detective work ace
ahh could you talk in my good ear
i thought i heard you call me ace
einhorn gets real close
maybe i was wrong about you
maybe you are more than just a pet dick
objects are knocked off the desk as they lean back
your guns digging into my hip
more kissing the ace stops
still coming on whats wrong ace
want me to read you your rights
what is it
that bony little bitch melissa robinson
you just dont do anything for me
he quickly adjusts his crotch to conceal the erection
einhorn withdraws with a coy smile
ill be here if you ever want a real woman
theres a sharp knock at the door
what is it
aguado opens the door
everything okay in here
heard some commotion
you want me to throw him out
why dont you throw yourself out
a crestfallen aguado exits
ace heads for the door
ace i want you to leave everything to us
cant do that lieutenant
i was hired to find snowflake
when we find marino well deliver snowflake
when i find snowflake ill deliver marino
a full on thrash metal band is cranking on stage
kids leap wildly into the moshing pit
the same burnout is still thrashing his head wildly to the music
shouting nice to see you again
the burnout just keeps thrashing
ace spots woodstock watching the band and joins him
francis hows it goin
kidding thats none of your damn business
anything new on that dolphin
got his picture on some tuna cans but nothing so far
a singer roars on stage
he sounds like a garbage disposal full of cutlery
so what can i do for you today
i need info on a football flunky named ray finkle
sorry ace i cant help you right now
i gotta watch this band
they are the shit
dont worry about it
i mean dolphins arent exactly an endangered species
its not like the whole food chains gonna be affected if one highly intelligent mammal dies a slow and painful death
hell if the band is loud enough you wont even hear its pitiful whimpering
ace does his best suffering dolphin impression
woodstock is no longer enjoying the band
woodstock is at his computer
ace looks over his shoulder
finkles social security information appears on the screen
this guys last reported income was september
we know hes incredibly thrifty
woodstock types in more information
finkles trw flashes on the screen
well i think we can be pretty sure hes involved in the kidnapping of the dolphin
what makes you say that
theres two thousand dollars worth of smelts on his visa card
after a beat ace realizes it was a bad joke
please yank me no further
i beg of you
the last time this guy used his credit card was june
he rented a car from avis
he was a bad boy
they found it abandoned two months later in south miami
you did all you could
thanks for nothin
hey man according to this your friend ray finkle doesnt exist
hmm i know what thats like
ace emerges from the basement
the band is between songs
ace strolls by the burnout whose head has now stopped
to burnout did you get all the spiders outta there
ace heads out then freezes
the two thugs that took marino are standing at the exit
then they see ace and start towards him reaching inside their coats
suddenly the music starts
the burnouts head wails again
his manic gyrations interfere with the thugs long enough for ace to bolt
one of the thugs pushes the burnout violently against the wall as they pursue ace
calling as he gets up thanks man
youre a great dancer
ace pushes his way through the crowd
the thugs follow
ace nears the stage
people are diving off and getting moshed
before the thugs grab him ace runs up and throws himself from the stage
the insane crowd begins to pass him around over their heads
the thugs exchange a look then dive after ace and a mosh chase ensues
ace is passed back onto the stage as the song comes to an end
the singer is lying there exhausted
ace sees the crowd starting to put the thugs down so he quickly grabs the microphone off the floor
screams the audience looks at ace for a second
then the band members exchange a look and go for it
its a nightmarish little ditty
ace sings like one of satans minions
the crowd seems to understand
they throw the thugs high in the air again and mosh them away from the stage
the thugs are shooting stray bullets the whole time
ace incites the crowd even more now with a punching gesture
the crowd follows their new leader punching with one hand moshing with the other
the thugs get the living crap moshed out of them
when the song ends ace raises fists in the air
the cheering crowd violently drops the thugs
theyre out cold
aces car peels out and races by the parked ford bronco
aces car skids to a halt
he hops out
theres a loud banging at the door
melissa awakens looks at the clock a
she drags herself to the door
who is it
i refuse to do a knock knock joke
come on open up
melissa opens the door
ace what are you doing
its the middle of the night
you have to commit me
aces clunker speeds down the highway
finkle escaped from shady acres in tampa
they still have some of his stuff
so you think theyre going to let us just waltz in and look around
a state hospital located on acres of green manicured lawns
the reception area
a doctor is before melissa
im doctor handly
now who is it that youd like to have us look at
angle on ace looking like the football player who never wore a helmet
im ready to go in coach
just give me a chance
i know theres a lot riding on it but its all psychological
got to stay in a positive frame of mind
memorize the play book
study the films
ace strikes a dramatic pose and freezes with a crazed look on his face
im gonna execute a button hook pattern
he begins to make a play in slow motion
super slo mo
melissa walks with the doctor
patients are sitting around doing outdoor therapy etc
youre brother wont be the first professional football player weve treated
is that right
were very sensitive to the emotional stress athletes have to endure
ace runs across the b
screaming im open
well have to do some preliminary evaluations but i think your brother will fit in nicely here
thats a relief doctor
ace takes a snap from a three foot hedge and dives over it into the end zone
melissa and the doctor stop to watch him
he seems to have some difficulty letting go of the game
has he had a long history of mental illness
truthfully as long as ive known him
ace does a wild touchdown dance with some of the other patients participating
the doctor is showing melissa around
ace is walking alongside them adjusting his imaginary shoulder pads
this is our therapy room
arts and crafts
they turn a corner
ace squats to pick the dirt out of his cleats
thats the storage room
this hallway leads to another recreational area ace whistles loudly and gestures like a referee
ace sticks his head in the water fountain then sits down on the bench outside the storage room
hell be fine by himself for the next twenty minutes
well why dont i show you the dormitories then
they leave ace
after a beat ace gets up and does a quick spin pattern into the storage room door
ace does a quick search and locates several boxes maked finkle
ace looks through the first couple of boxes and finds only clothes
in the third box he hits the jackpot he finds sicko arts and crafts dedicated to marino
die dan potholders shredded isotoner gloves
he opens a little diary
is insanely scrawled on every page
ace finds a newspaper clipping the headline reads reading a massive search ended today when rescue workers were unable to find the body of lois einhorn
stunned a camper reported lost since friday
to himself lois einhorn
holy shit balls
ace sits bewildered
the phone rings at emilios desk
he answers it
ace is on the phone
a crazy guy is hovering nearby
this is chicken little
the sky is falling
a beat as he listens to aces news
i dont get it
whats it mean
it means shes involved in this
the articles dated the day before finkle disappeared
before who disappeared
the guy who took the dolphin
the guy youre supposed to be looking for
einhorn didnt tell you did she
i see where youre goin with this and youre goin alone
a crazy guy stands next to ace now and begins mimicking everything he says
come on e
i tell her about finkle she doesnt tell a soul
i have an article here that connects her with finkle
you gotta check her out
to crazy guy mimicking do you mind
the crazy guy stops and moves to one of the phones
ace i like my job
i get health insurance and benefits
into receiver im the lindberg baby
come and get me
emilio einhorn is involved
youre gonna have to make a decision here
beat listen i gotta get off the phone
i think i just solved the lindberg case
melissa and the doctor return
well look whos trying to use the phone
ace covers the phone receiver and whispers to them in a heartfelt voice
brian piccalo is dead
ace breaks down
melissa hangs up the phone and leads him away
we hear a thrash version of the theme to brians song as they exit the hospital
emilio stands at a window watching einhorn drive off
the coast is clear so he sneaks into
he rifles through her file cabinet
he tears through papers
then he looks in her desk
stuffed in the back of the drawer he finds a personal note we can make out the signature
he pockets it and walks out
ace and melissa pull up in the old heap
good job today
youre quite a dirty rotten filthy liar
are you sure you dont want to stay here with me
naw i got some thinking to do
besides youd be safer with salman rushdie okay
she gets out of the car then turns and leans in the window
i know there isnt much time left
the game is tomorrow
but i know youve done your best
its just an impossible situation
i dont expect
ace leans over and kisses her
bet on the dolphins
wiggles nose enters frame and hits the play button
shickadance rasp venturaaaa
your time is up
you hear me
we widen to find ace on the couch listening
ace its e
got something you might find interesting
its a note from podacter to einhorn thanking her for a wonderful saturday night
this is too weird man
wiggles obediently hits another button and rewinds the phone tape
ace pops sunflower seeds and holds some evidence aloft thinking
a bird eats seeds out of his naval
what the hell does lois einhorn have to do with ray finkle
come on think
ace is posed like rodins the thinker
finkle and einhorn
in it together
a small monkey sits in the same position
ace pacing jumping up and down
trying to get his intuitive juices flowing
the monkey is likewise jumping on the mantle
here we go
answers right there
just gotta get some blood to the brain
finkle and einhorn
finkle and einhorn
finkle and einhorn
finkle and einhorn
the animals all watch him like hes crazy
ace sits staring at a picture of finkle on the coffee table
hes totally spent and on the verge of tears
whimpering finkle and einhorn
einhorn and finkle
he turns to see the monkey crashed out in a heap on a sofa pillow
to sleeping monkey quitter
wiggles jumps up onto the coffee table now
ace cant be bothered with him
what do you want
wiggles whines at the tone of aces voice
i got no food for you
you gotta have money to buy food
i gotta find the dolphin to get the money
i dont see any dolphins around here do you
face it its hopeless
your master is a ace buries his face in his hands
his dog wiggles does the same
then ace looks up again
suddenly he is silenced by something amazing
wiggles dark haired floppy ears are lying around finkles picture like a wig
ace combs the hair over the head shot
the make over is unmistakable
oh my god
he jumps up estatic
einhorn is finkle
finkle is einhorn
einhorn is a man
aces expression quickly turns sour
ace makes a mad dash into the bathroom
ace furiously brushes his teeth
ace rinses with mouthwash spits it out and gags
ace is in the shower
he slowly curls up into a ball under the steaming water with an expression of horror on his face
a womans leg being shaved
woman sexily putting on nylons
woman hands squeezing perfume bulb
womans hand putting on afc championship ring
one stone is missing
ace sticks wads of gum in his mouth while he watches einhorns house from his car
remembering youre gun is sticking into my hip
einhorn comes out her front door and gets into her car
ace shudders once more and then follows her
the road is jammed in one direction
going towards the super bowl
einhorn drives in the opposite direction
out of town
ace tails her at a safe distance with his head out the window of course
various shots of crazy fans piling into the stadium
melissa bobby riddle and guests all amidst the usual pre game hobnobbing
most of the talk centers on the loss of marino
emilio in full uniform and a couple cops are providing extra security for the box
einhorn drives south out of town
the areas getting remote
einhorn turns down a deserted road and comes to
a large abandoned industrial facility
einhorn parks disappears inside
a few beats later ace kills the engine and exits singing the score to mission impossible
immense machines and swimming pool sized cauldrons
ace cautiously makes his way through the desolate site singing quietly now
he stops when he hears a familiar voice
i particularly like the match ups of the defense
ace sees a weird sight a huge tv projection screen tuned to the super bowl pre game show
marino is tied to a football tackling sled
the two thugs take turns running into dan with their shoulders driving him back five feet each time
but the real story of this game is the absence of dan marino
him being kidnapped and all has got to be a strain on this miami team
i really feel sorry for those guys
i mean its hard enough enduring the pressure of the super bowl without your star quarterback gettin himself kidnapped
this is the whole ball of wax folks
you wanna get kidnapped you do it in the off season
marino looks incredulously at the screen
next to him snowflake watches from a ground level cistern serving as an ad hoc tank
ace sneaks closer
the crowd quiets as jon bon jovi prepares to sing the national anthem
various shots of fans all standing at attention
in the owners box melissa looks to emilio
einhorn is now in front of the big screen tv singing the national anthem along with bon jovi
the thugs vinnie and roc are behind her standing at attention
the song ends
the crowd cheers
in a sultry fashion einhorn circles marino now
i just love super bowl sunday dont you dan
a magical afternoon where dreams are made
look lady if you want tickets youre going about it in the wrong way
do i look familiar to you dan
does it seem as if weve met someplace before
i dont know
i get hit in the head a lot
on the tv the ref makes an announcement
the eagles will receive
dan really struggles now
looks like were going to have to kick dan
einhorn steps behind a football set up on a tee
and in perfect sync with the kicker on tv she boots a ball through a window of the warehouse
marino doesnt know what to think
i made some refreshments dan
would you like some refreshments dan
ill be right back daaaan
dan struggles but to no avail
look i dont know how much psycho woman is paying you guys but i can double it
sorry danny boy
psycho woman keeps us out of prison
vinnie grabs a feeder fish and entices snowflake to the surface
roc raises a football
hey marino check it out
im throwin passes to a dolphin
he chucks the ball and hits snowflake hard
the thugs both laugh hysterically
snowflake makes an angry leap and drenches the thugs
snowflake laughs now the thugs are furious
get some more fish
roc walks behind a big piece of machinery reaches down for the pail of smelts but sees nothing
where the hells the smelts
he stands up straight and we all hear that familiar pop of a sunflower seed being cracked open
rocs eyes widen
he turns and sees
ace coyly smiles at him blows the sunflower seed shells into his face and clang
he whacks roc in the head with a pail full of fish
doing brando he sleeps with the fishes
hey roc what the hell was that
vinnie cocks his gun and goes to check out the sound
vinnie rounds the corner and sees nothing
he walks a little further and notices a trail of smelts lined up on the ground
he follows the trail around a corner and we see roc unconscious but moaning
he is sitting against the ground with his legs spread apart and the pail over his head
the trail of smelts leads to his crotch
there is one halfway into his zipper with its tail flipping
vinnie takes in this sight then rushes over to roc and stands him up
whats goin on
we see ace at the top of a giant machine
he is aiming a pound steel hook that hangs on a chain from the ceiling
guess what boys its nap time
ace gently releases the hook
just as vinnie and roc turn to look the iron hook shears both of their heads clean off
two headless bodies fall to the ground in slow motion with blood gushing from their necks
oh my god
i didnt mean to oh man
ace holds his head and dances around completely freaking out what he had done
looking to god lord i swear
i just wanted to knock them out
ace abruptly stops to think
is that murder
i dont know
they were gonna kill me
but they didnt
but they tried
thats self defense
i have nothing to worry about
ace nervously whistling as he wipes his fingerprints off the hook
ace checks on snowflake then goes to marino
he signals for dan to keep quiet then starts to untie him
whispers who are you
whispers ace ventura
ive been sent in with a special play
whispers quarterback sneak
too many men on the field
einhorns holding a gun on them from the other side of snowflakes tank
i warned you ventura
what happened to ace
she pulls out a cellular phone and dials
be careful with that phone lieutenant
i wouldnt want you to get a tumor
into phone sergeant aguado its lt
get some men over to the old ironworks factory on victoria road
ive got the kidnapper trapped in the warehouse
its ace ventura
hes killed marino and snowflake
einhorn smiles as she puts the phone away
get in here
ace gets a very guilty look
who are they
you mean theres other people here
a battalion of cop cars screech away as we hear
attention all units
code in progress at victorville road
officer needs back up
the cops and emilio listen to their ear pieces
suspects name ace ventura male caucasian he is armed and dangerous
emilio nudges melissa
emilio high tails it out of there
dodging concession stand patrons bathroom lines etc
melissa runs behind trying to catch up
emilio is he in trouble
dont worry theres nothing ace cant handle
einhorn cocks her gun
aces face is glistening with tears
hes a complete wreck
dont kill meeee
ill never tell anyone
indicating marino hes the one you want
indicating ace no
the two argue
einhorn fires a shot in the air to stop them
no im gonna kill the dolphin first
to ace i wouldnt want you to miss that
einhorn walks to the edge of the tank
she aims the gun at snowflake and fires
we see the bullet miss snowflake under water
snowflake swims wildly
she fires again
suddenly ace hollers
blue forty two
einhorn turns to ace
einhorn shoots at ace
he dives out of the way
suddenly snowflake leaps out of the water and takes the gun out of einhorns hand like the trick we saw earlier
snowflake swims around the pool with the gun in his mouth
the highly trained dolphin
perhaps the smartest mammal in the animal kingdom
see how he knew exactly what i wanted him to do as if our minds were somehow in complete synchronization
they have been know to save men at sea you know
they have their own language
to snowflake snowflake
come here snowflake
bring me the gun
makes dolphin sounds just like the trick in his routine however snowflake swims around the tank passes ace then hands the gun back to einhorn
he finishes with a tail walk
under his breath stupid fish
on tv miamis kicker boots a perfect field goal from fifty yards
he got all of his leg into that one
the field goal kicker is hugged by his teammates
good to see someone who doesnt buckle under the pressure
yeah not like in when we choked
einhorn walks to ace and puts the gun against his head
what would you know about pressure
well ive kissed a man
of course theres never been a more crucial kick than the famous kick heard round the world
the famous footage airs on tv
they all turn to watch
i mean its clear to me that it was a good hold
finkle just booted it
the laces werent out
the laces einhorn takes a shot at the screen creating a hole in maddens forehead
ace uses the moment to smack the gun out of her hand
a huge no holds barred fight ensues
ace and einhorn punch each other about the face and stomach
einhorn throws a punch at ace
ace goes down
einhorn goes for the loose gun
ace leaps and tackles her
they both crash into old rusty equipment raising a mountain of dust
marino struggles all the while trying to get free
einhorn kicks ace
he flies into marino
having a little trouble with the lady ace
out of breath you dont understand shes a einhorn grabs ace throws him into a head lock and begins wailing on his face
meanwhile cops start arriving swat team members disperse onto the catwalk as the fight continues
they try but cant get a bead on ace as the two roll around on the floor
they fight up a flight of stairs then back down
to the amazement of the swat team ace and einhorn slug it out as equals
caught up get him lois
now they crash through a plate glass window together
ace gets to his knees first and wobbles toward the gun
its the first clear shot the swat team has had
screaming shoot him
we all hear the guns cocked
we see ace in the rifle sights
we see fingers twitch on triggers
a loud voice comes from off camera
melissa is holding emilios gun under his chin
put down your guns or this cop gets it
the swat team hesitates
i mean it
much to emilios surprise she cocks the gun
whispers to melissa ah
thats a hair trigger
loud to cops shes not joking
the swat team leader signals his men
they lower their guns
einhorn gets back to her feet
he kidnapped snowflake
he killed roger podacter and he was about to kill dan marino and me
fiction can be fun
but i find the reference section much more enlightening
doing his best clarence darrow for instance if you were to look up professional footballs all time bonehead plays you might read about a miami dolphin kicker named ray finkle
who missed a twenty six yard field goal in the closing seconds of super bowl seventeen
in one breath what you wouldnt read about is how ray finkle lost his mind and was committed to a mental institute only to escape and join the police force
under the assumed identity of a missing hker seducing her way to the top in a diabolical plan to get even with dan marino whom he blamed for the entire thing
ace gasps for air
everyone is totally confused
what the hell are you trying to say
shes not lois einhorn
shes ray finkle
shes a man
ace walks over to her
lets just see whos lying
would a real woman have to wear one of these
ace dramatically pulls at einhorns hair thinking its a wig
einhorns head flies back
the hair is real
ace keeps tugging it
the swat team ready themselves
boy thats really on there
but tell me this would a real woman be missing these
ace rips open einhorns blouse and reveals two beautiful feminine breasts
the sharp shooters are tensing
ace is laughing nervously now
ha ha ha
that kind of surgery can be done over the weekend
but i doubt if she could find the time during her busy schedule to get rid of mr
ace rips off einhorns skirt
einhorn now stands there fully nude
she appears to be the perfect figure of a woman
ace looks at melissa and emilio and shrugs his shoulders
then just when it seems all is lost dan marino who is back behind einhorn motions for ace to come over
to everyone could you excuse me just a second
ace goes to dan
melissa still holds emilio hostage
shoot him now
to cops dont anybody make a move
marino whispers something in his ear
ace looks confident again
he once more addresses the crowd
ladies and gentlemen my esteemed colleague mr
marino has just brought some new evidence to my attention
now history has certainly shown that even the most intuitive criminal minds can be wrong from time to time
but if i have been mistaken
if the lieutenant is indeed a woman
then my friends she is suffering from the worst case of hemorrhoids i have ever seen
ace spins einhorn around now exposing to the world the healthy set of male genetalia that finkle has learned to keep tucked between his legs
and if we have any balls well actually show it
close up on einhorn finkle
he finally drops the facade
deepest voice possible it was marinos fault
the laces were in
breaking down now they were in
quick cuts of all the cops spitting with disgust
then emilio spits
then close on marino spitting
they all have kissed her him it
even snowflake blows his spout
ace confidently cracks a sunflower seed
somebody read it its rights
suddenly finkle picks up a shard of broken glass and lunges at ace
thinking fast ace sidesteps finkle and sends him head first into snowflakes makeshift tank
after a few seconds finkle fights his way to the surface and thrashes around helplessly
gasping for air help i cant swim
finkle goes under again
we see him under water sinking down
snowflake swims to him now allowing him to grab onto his fin and pulls finkle gently to the side of the pool
finkle lies there exhausted
ace reaches down into frame removing the afc championship ring from finkles finger
we see that its the ring with the missing stone
ace replaces it with the stone in his pocket
its a perfect fit
melissa is still holding the gun on emilio
you can give me back my gun now
melissa has forgotten she even had the gun
she hands it to emilio and faints in his arms
now aguado appears beside ace
i dont know how you did it ventura
but that was damn good police work
alright guys lets wrap this up
twenty or more police cars in single file provide more than ample escort for
ace and marino in aces chevy bel aire with the cracked windshield
both of them have their heads sticking out so that they can see
marino has a wad of gum in his mouth
the long line of flashing lights and cop cars drives at top speed up route one
aces bel aire right in the middle
got any more gum
the super bowl halftime show is in progress
marino is in uniform warming up
emilio is drooling at the cheerleaders
ace and melissa are standing near the fifty yard line taking in the awesome spectacle
some fireworks go off around the tank
a marching band plays a triumphant tune
we see a helicopter come up over the side of the stadium carrying snowflake
ladies and gentlemen the miami dolphins are proud to welcome back to bobby riddle stadium our beloved mascot and star of the halftime show
the helicopter lowering snowflake into his tank
as the crowd roars melissa turns to ace and with snowflake in the background performing spectacular flips they kiss
as melissa and ace kiss the prized white pigeon lands on a gatorade dispenser in the foreground
ace spots it and starts to make a move
just as he closes in for the grab the philadelphia eagles mascot eagle walks up to get a drink and shoos the pigeon away
ace is furious
do you know what youve done
the giant eagle head looks up at ace
ace grabs him
you just cost me ten thousand bucks polly
yeah blow me
pull back to find eagles mascot and ace arguing
we cant hear whats said but theres a lot of finger pointing
emilio stops his leering to check out whats going on
the announcer up in the booth reads a release
the national football league would now like to offer a special thank you to the man who rescued dan marino and our beloved snowflake
on the field the mascot shoves ace
ace shoves back
a great humanitarian and lover of all animals
ace is straddling the eagle pounding the shit out of giant head
the image is flashed on the big stadium screen
we freeze frame on this huge picture of ace as he looks into camera with his fist raised
loki note my copy of this script has the bloody end of vinnie and roc physically crossed out by three black marker lines presumably by the authors
fortunately they were crossed out diagonally so i could still type the scene out for all to enjoy
