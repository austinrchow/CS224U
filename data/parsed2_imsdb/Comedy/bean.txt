by richard curtis and robin driscoll a very grand room with lots of wood and some very famous portraits round the walls
a group of grave gentlemen and gentlewomen
they are the trustees of the national gallery
lord walton a very grand man sits at the table head
to his right sits his assistant gareth
all are deep in thought
lord walton fidgets with a pencil on the table
he raises his head as though about to speak
everyone looks up expectantly
lord walton goes back to fidgeting
so does everyone else
the scene is as silent and static as we left it last
then i suppose we could just sack him
mr bean comes out of his house ready to face the world he walks up the street tutting slightly at a no parking sign he passes
the street is totally car free except for a very visible lime green mini
a policeman strolls by and glances down at a pair of legs sticking out from under it next to a toolbox
he moves on satisfied that someone is mending their car
bean approaches the car and whips out the fake legs he left there
he then unlocks the big padlock that secures the car door pops the fake legs inside fiddles with something else in the back seat and drives away at a frightening
speed with a smug look on his face
the theme music big and dramatic begins as do the rest of the credits
bean gaily motors on then unexpectedly the sweeping theme tune jumps as if it has hit a scratch the cinema audience should be worried theres a sound fault
bean comes to a street full of sleeping policemen he goes at them at quite a lick and every time he shoots over one of the bumps the theme tune
bean looks a little annoyed into the back seat we now see the cause of the problem
instead of having a car radio bean has an old record player strapped into the back seat playing the theme tune
on he drives through empty streets then jolt hes reached the glorious familiarity of central london big ben and all but heels now in dreadful traffic
heels not happy
he looks to the left and sees a very thin alleyway
he takes out a metal comb from his pocket and using it like a bombers sight line checker measures the front of his car and the width of the alley
he s satisfied does a degree turn and shoots down the alley
it is such a perfect fit that sparks fly from the door handles as they graze the walls
but at the end of the alley the traffics just as bad
bean notices hes outside harrods
theres a tail coated security guard at the front door
bean watches him stroll a bit down the street and takes his chance
he turns and drives straight through the double doors into the store
bean and his car whizz through the ground floor past perfume counters and leather glove racks
cut to a security guard
as he passes one of the counters beans little car just shoots behind him
the guard continues through the childrens section there are giant elephants and teddies childrens size cars then two huge plastic tractors and then stock still strangely in harmony actually the
lime green mini with bean in it
the guard walks straight past
the moment he is gone bean shoots off again but damn
spies another guard and is forced to turn and drive down some very steep stairs indeed
the theme song goes crazy as the record player jumps
people waiting at a gilded lift
they hear a strange sound and turn to see what it is
in fact its coming from inside the lift
when the lift doors open out shoots the mini through the double doors and back into the street
out in the street bean is faced by an accident
there are flashing lights a crumpled car suggestions of hurt passengers
bean looks concerned
an ambulance roars through the traffic
it reaches its hospital turns off and there right smack behind it is the mini
cut in to see bean smiling broadly
he whizzes into trafalgar square maybe even across it sending pigeons and tourists flying and parks directly outside the statuesque national gallery
of course theres not another car there
just the gallery and the mini
bean gets out of the car takes out his bag thinks a little opens it and takes out a doctor on call sign
to re enforce it he puts a bone in the back window and a skull of the front seat
happy with the arrangement he re locks the padlock and sets off smiling up the big stairs to work
as he does so pan up the building and into the window of the room where that board meeting was taking place
look i dont hate the man but
i know gareth
its the mental strain he inflicts on us all
how is professor bradbury a grand gentleman mr morrison pipes up
im morrison heels got the feeling back in his fingers but his hands are still stapled together
mmmm and how far are we with the computer hubert
timothy is loading the final catalogue data as we speak milord
an awful thing to say but when the programs up and running our mr
bean will become a little less than
a glimmer of hope
bean wanders past three or four portraits and mimics the characters in them
he passes a guard
not looking up from his book morning bean
the guard sighs with boredom
he gets this from bean every day
as bean moves on he treads on the heel of a tourists shoe
it comes off bean moves on blithely
bean is passing the very special room where leonardo da vincis cartoon the virgin and child hangs preserved by a very dim artificial light
there are silhouettes of a few tourists in the room reverently studying the work listening to a female gallery guide
bean dips into his pocket for his identity badge and in so doing brings out a coin
the coin drops and rolls into the special room
bean follows it into the darkness
hushed by leonardo da vinci
as you can see the special light in here goes some way to protect the drawing from photodisintegration caused by gamma
the camera stays outside the room with the picture in view
we hear the squeak of a tiny door open then a click
the room is suddenly flooded in blazing white light
the onlookers gasp in horror
bean re emerges from the room with his precious coin
as an afterthought he pops his hand round the doorway and turns off the light
he scuttles away
the gallery guide shakes her head in total exasperation
maybe it would be simpler to pack all our paintings onto trucks and move the entire national gallery somewhere else
and not tell him
we could all move to france
all those in favour
they all raise their hands wildly
come on settle down everyone
bean stands in the elevator silently with four other people
he gives himself a long squirt of breathfreshener
then offers it to the others who politely refuse him
so he stands still again
bean then smells something unpleasant
he leans and has a little sniff of the person to his left
all right there
then he sniffs to his right and reels at what he smells
he again takes out the breath freshener and forces it upon vincent an elderly gentleman who is mortified
at this moment the elevator stops bean and vincent get out and the camera follows vincent as he heads for the boardroom door and enters
he is another trustee
this dialogue is heard from behind the closed door
im sorry im late
why cant we just give him the boot for crying out loud
steady on old man
not you you idiot
bean with cup of tea walks along a corridor
he cant not interfere for tidiness sake
one empty room he switches off the light
another he shuts the door
he passes a computer room with an open door where a big man is busily typing in a programme bean looks at him snootily and heads on
he approaches the door to his office
a sign reads storage catalogue
there is a huge padlock on the door
bean takes out a big key and enters his domain
hes been here for years and made it his own
its an odd little world
theres a framed picture of shirley bassey on his desk and airfix planes hang from the ceiling
also a large cosy armchair and a t
a pleasant man in a suit around breezes in
ah bean im looking for a painting by van hocht
this is what bean likes to do best
the camera follows as he turns sees the extraordinary sight behind him
his office is just a tiny corner of a massive storage room hundreds of feet high and long the walls completely full of rack after rack of stored paintings
at the end of the room we can see hundreds of sculptures busts modern abstracts men on horses classical maidens rodins the lot
its like the giant storehouse at the end of raiders of the lost ark
bean sets off into it in his own eccentric way
he knows exactly where heels going
he climbs a ladder like you find in a library then pushes himself off and whizzes the entire length of the room on slippery wooden runners
he has now reached the sculpture area but the painting heels looking for is on the other side
he crosses the room by using the sculptures as a kind of artistic obstacle course
in front of him is the burghers of calais a rodin statue of prisoners in chains
he simply walks across their heads like stones in a stream
he then comes to an abstract modern piece which he uses as a slide and at the end of which he crawls through the hole in the next modern thing
he then begins to climb up various famous ancient statues using the mouths as footholes breasts as support codpieces as steps and empty eyes as finger holes
after a problem getting his
foot caught in the jaw of a sculptured dog he walks flat along a modern sculpture then uses a sequence of classic sculptures as stairs on the head of a
little degas ballerina one step on to the bottom of a horse two steps onto the head of the person riding the horse three steps and now hes on the other side of the hall
he then triumphantly pulls out a painting
its the one
what would we do without you
the entire inventory of british art stored in that one curious brain of yours
then we are agreed gentlemen
only if were positive that the new catalogue database will render mr
beans hitherto talents obsolete
theres no question
mr bean is
we can all stop taking the pills
a reserved smatter of laughter from relief more than anything
talks into an intercom on the table
miss hutchinson would you send mr
bean up to the boardroom please
oh and lord walton the grierson gallery called again
to the room one final thing
once again we have been invited by the grierson gallery of southern california to second one of our staff for a short visit
the grierson has a fairly modest collection but it does include the most famous american painting of all whistlers mother
cut to the trustees they shake their heads and wrinkle their noses not very interested
a year old sir rupert puts up his hand
and may i say sir how honoured we are that you still grace us with all your time wisdom and infinite knowledge
your invaluable thoughts sir
could you speak up please
i didnt catch the question
back in his office area bean ceremoniously hands suit man the van hocht painting
hes very proud of himself
thank you bean
youre a genius
bean laughs delighted
suit man exits and miss hutchinson enters warily
lord walton would like to see you in the boardroom
bean gives a little pleasured squeak
how exciting for him
he follows miss hutchinson out into the corridor
bean walks along the same corridor as before
turns off another light
then comes to the room where he saw the programmer
the computer showing a van gogh portrait is on and no ones there
bean who hates wasted electricity goes in to switch it off
we see the van gogh change to a pictorial representation of the storage room with an arrow pointing to where the van gogh is located
bean is clearly going to be replaced by this programme
bean searches for the plug but its under acres of desk so he simply pulls a cable out of the back the computer
the entire system clicks off
at which moment the programmer comes back in
whats happening here
with a slightly guilty smile he picks up the cable again looks with puzzlement at the five available places to plug it in and just takes a random guess
and a disastrous one
there is a ugly electrical fizzle
the screens come on white then pop out completely
bean realises that he has done something wrong and quickly shoves the cable into another circuit
the van gogh appears happily on the screen
bean and programmer both give out a sigh of relief
bean smiles and leaves quickly
but a second later the computer screen disintegrates and the van gogh slides down the screen like a water colour in the rain
the prog difficult to breathe
you have your voting slips gentlemen
please remember the americans are looking for something quite high powered
a doctorate preferably
there is a knock at the door
lord walton smiles
the rest of the faces in the room are looking dangerously close to smug
bean is very nervous indeed
gravely ah mr
please take a seat for a moment
i have some news which will not im afraid
the phone rings
lord walton answers
bean sits next to vincent and sniffs at him
vincents breath hasnt improved
into phone yes
put him on
all of it
absolutely all of it
did you back it up
how long will it
another six months
come up here will you dear boy
he slowly hangs up
everyone has got the gist of what has just occurred with the new computer the energy drains from them all as they contemplate another six months with bean still on
lord walton coughs politely
as i was saying gentlemen
the grierson gallery
thousands of miles away though it is
doctorate or impishly no doctorate perhaps all get the message at the same moment and hurriedly scribble on their voting slips
the slips get handed down the line to lord walton
we see that every single slip has bean on it
you are going to america
overwhelmed ooooh how lovely
there is a knock at the door
the fat bespectacled programmer puts his head round it
beaming ah timothy
bean rounds a corner and walks towards us imitating a bowlegged cowboy
the theme from bonanza plays
he whips out his pair of imaginary six shooters spins them on his fingers and returns them to their imaginary holsters making gun sound effects
hes very happy
he passes the security guard he draws his gun on him zero reaction the guard just raises his eyebrows and yawns
bean heads on through the gallery merrily but suddenly his good mood is broken when he notices schoolgirls entering a new exhibition called the ultra human form
this worries him and we soon see why bean heads in to the room where all the paintings are very graphic nudes and the girls are having a good giggle
bean quickly rushes over and with his hand covers the breasts of the painting theyre inspecting
two girls then move on to the next painting which unfortunately also has breasts
bean stretches and just manages to cover them with his other hand
now the third girl heads on so bean can drop the hand on the first painting but now has to try to cover the breasts on the third painting which
is a real long stretch away
he cant quite make it so he takes off his shoes which gives him the extra inches
now all three girls leave the paintings but to beans chagrin head over to a classical nude sculpture in the middle of the room
its like the graces naked women back to back
bean thinks fast
he quickly whips off his belt and rushes over to the statue where he succeeds in looping it round to cover all six nipples
unfortunately the girls have already lost interest and head over to the other side of the gallery
to beans horror
because at that moment we reveal what is on the other side of the room
a epic painting in the style of the others with literally graphically naked people
bean sprints across the room stands on a chair and desperately tries to cover a particularly lurid example of a gentlemans manhood
at which moment the teacher of the party and other schoolgirls appear and scream in chorus
bean thinks that it is the painting that has caused offence and is in outraged agreement with them
cut wide to reveal that they are screaming because hes beltless trousers have fallen down
am california time
a modern building with plenty of glass
large modern sculptures are spotted around its grounds including a dramatic one of two huge old cars head down in the ground backs protruding into the air
thomas grierson owner of the gallery wearing a slick expensive suit walks with dave leary and bernie both in casual jackets and ties
grierson is a vain slightly pedantic and pompous man maybe short always just trying to show hes boss
the three are strolling towards the main entrance
huge sign the grierson gallery with a silhouette of whistlers mother taken from the painting as an incorporated logo
lord walton assures me this guys one of the very top scholars in the english art world
has a couple of doctorates no less
bernie is smooth and smiley
david leary vice president is a very pleasant but slightly worried man knocking on
too nice for his own good
the three pass a lone mime artist wearing a cheap vac form president clinton face mask
david cant help being just a little nice to him and finds himself left behind
he scampers to catch up
first catching under the handle then the couch then four other chairs and finally the deep freeze
no ones going to get in through that door
back in the hall bean pushes the string back inside the letter box and slaps his hand in satisfaction
he locks the doors enormous padlock looks about carefully to make sure no ones around and then hides the key under a garden gnome on the floor standing amongst a
row of pathetic pot plants
the lady checking in bean looks puzzled as she holds his passport
so he pulls the shockingly stupid face
h yes she sees thats the guy in the picture
she hands him his ticket
here we go sir
youve been moved to l st
apparently your friends at the gallery were so delighted that youre finally on your way
bean is very touched
bean enters the first class lounge
its fairly empty but bean still squeezes himself between an old lady drinking a cup of tea and a very grand looking american military man in a business suit
the grand man lights up a cigar
this doesnt please mr no smoking bean
first he waves the smoke away in small then big then huge wafting motions
then he tries miming to cut it up into segments and move them aside
the man pays no attention at all
bean puts a plastic mug over his face like a gas mask and breathes heavily
the man looks at him but doesnt give a damn bean now takes a paper bag catches some of the smoke and take it over and empties it into the
the grand man goes on smoking stubbornly
he then sees a magazine rack and leaves his cigar as he goes to get one
sounds like a real coup sir
getting this doctor of
however as you know this is not an inexpensive venture and financially speaking were in very serious crap right now
he cant quite hide his tackiness
david holds the door for grierson then sees an old woman coming towards him
he waits for her to go through and due to his sweetness is again left behind
he rushes to catch up
they are now passing the reception counter cum gallery shop
david exchanges smiles with the cashier annie
very bubbly not very bright
the shop is full of whistlers mother memorabilia posters cards porcelain statuettes
im wondering if one of you would have this guy stay in your home instead of some expensive hotel
love to sir but no can do
no spare room
oh look i mean its kind of the last thing
i mean id really like to but
things at home are kind of sensitive so i couldnt really er
i thought perhaps as vice president and in view of the unfortunate attendances for the summer show this year
the massive financial on the other hand
maybe a breath of fresh air is just what my family needs
course it might need a little smoothing over
whens he due
grierson hands david a piece of paper
you have a problem with that
looking forward to it
the camera faces mr bean sitting in a photo booth
his face is totally impassive for then flashes
and then just before the th flash he pulls the biggest maddest face youve ever seen
he gives a little satisfied giggle
a pleasant suburban house
davids car pulls into the drive
jennifer his slightly gothic year old daughter is kissing brad her scruffy boyfriend
he sits astride a motor scooter
he has a bum fluff moustache
david gets out of his car and approaches them
how was school
she doesnt break the kiss with brad oh really
thats good great
well talk some more
the two continue kissing as david moves on
hes just about to head for the house when a swish convertible draws up at the curb
davids wife alison has been given a lift home by her young attractive boss charles
they are laughing in the car as david walks up
he is slightly disturbed to see alison kiss charles on the cheek before getting out with her port folio
charles smiles pleasantly on seeing david
to alison wow late
brightly i had to do some last minute stuff
weve got a heavy load on at present
how about you gallery going well
ahm well you know thats a tough question on one level i think it
dont ask him about work charlie
lifes too short
alison is the same age as david but seems to have lasted the course better shes confident in good shape
the atmosphere is awkward
jennifer screams out
her year old brother kevin has sprung from the shrubbery and lassoed her and brad
alison goes over to sort them out
you stop that right now
good looking too
you think so
well i spose theyre pretty you know
okay looks wise
take after their mother huh
david is not very happy here
it is open plan and leads through into the lounge
david and alison enter
alison puts her port folio on the table and leads david onto a sofa
she puts her arms round him
lets take a break david
this weekend why dont we just get into the car and drive to the coast
find a motel
like before the kids were born
go to a fairground
win me another bambi
she reaches across and picks up a little ceramic bambi on a table next to the couch
jennifer can stay and look after kevin sounds great
theres this guy whos coming to work at the gallery from england
and they asked me if wed like to
put him up for a while
there arent hotels
yes there are hotels
they just thought maybe itd be nice for him to stay with a real american family
popcorn waffles all that stuff
and what did you say
i said id check with you
she looks at him piercingly
this clearly happens a lot
she knows when hes telling the truth
then i said yes
she puts bambi carefully back on the table gets up and moves to the kitchen
do we know anything about him
ahm hes male
hes a doctor of er
at least things
i think they would have mentioned if he was a blind dwarf
or one of those guys who kills lots of people all the time
i think were looking at someone moderately normal here
david are you ever going to learn to say no
she shakes her head
its the last thing we need
thats exactly what i said
before i said great its a sensational idea
he knows hes made a mess here
enter kevin their smart young son strolling through
hiya dad ill need you upstairs for homework in about
checks watch oh minutes
and kevin exits
didnt kids do their own homework like way back
just imagining it
alison isnt really listening
a black london taxi is parked outside a terraced house with its motor idling
its driver looks fed up waiting
bean appears at a downstairs window motioning to his watch that he will not be long
bean is ready to leave his room
battered old suitcase in hand he checks the room from the doorway
every conceivable thing that can be opened cupboards drawers fridge sports an oversized padlock
even beans old g
phone has one on its dial
bean looks across to his teddy who is lounging on a miniature chair inside an up sided cardboard box
the box is sits on an armchair
a hand written sign taped to its roof reads teddy hotel followed by three stars
a smaller sign informs us that the hotel is full
bean is just about to leave but stops to consider
taking a felt tipped pen he adds two more stars on the hotel hoarding as a treat
he then slightly incomprehensibly begins to tie string it around various objects in the flat
the fridge the corner of a chair a couch leg
bean leaves his flat
lee notice a large official sign stuck on the door saying no smoking
he now turns his attention to the pieces of string hanging out the letter box in his door
grabbing the bunch of them he pulls
cut to back inside the flat
we now understand the string as all the furniture starts to move across the flat
it works incredibly neatly the chair reaches the door bean acts fast
he takes the cigar and quickly dunks it in the old womans cup of tea
he sits there guiltlessly as the grand man returns
simultaneously the man tries to suck the wet cigar and the old woman drinks the disgusting tea
a horrid experience for both
bean enters the plane and turns right into the body of the plane
after walking right down the plane he is directed by a hostess back up to first
as he walks back we notice the ridiculous contrast from totally cramped accommodation with hundreds of children and muzak to the elegance and space of first class
bean couldnt be more thrilled
there follows a sequence of short moments from this nightmare flight
the old tea drinking lady is being helped with her luggage
a hostess slides it into the compartment above her head
its for my grand daughter
the next instant bean comes up with his case
he opens the same locker and tries to fit his case in
doesnt quite go so he pushes it violently
we hear crunching cracking sounds
finally its almost there bean slams the locker door
one final definitive though muffled smash
the old lady looks at bean suspiciously
bean sits down and who should be his next door neighbour
the grand man whose name is reynolds
bean smiles merrily
the affection is not mutual
champagne comes round instantly
bean takes it along with a small bowl of nuts and clinks glasses with his unsmiling partner
bean tries to impress him by throwing nuts up into the air and catching them in his mouth a well practised art
bean then switches on the noisy overhead air blower
then cant turn it down again
its very stuck
he manages however to push it away from his face straight into reynolds
reynolds looks annoyed bean guiltless
then bean has an idea
he takes a tissue out of his pocket puts in his mouth chews it into a spitball and rams it into the blower
both of them are relieved
reynolds picks up his champagne to have his first proper sip
the spitball under high pressure shoots into it sending champagne spraying all over reynolds
not a good start
bean is reading the in flight magazine
theres an annoying sound
he looks sideways it is the headphones of the young boy in the seat across the aisle
hes fallen asleep with his headphones on
bean looks annoyed
then suddenly decides to cut his fingernails with a little pair of scissors he carries
he holds out his hand to snip the nail and accidentally on purpose simply cuts the wire of the boys headset
wide shot of the plane everyone is asleep except one pool of light
its mr bean still up reading
but even he is wilting
his eyes close and his body starts to waver towards sleep
next to him reynolds is in a total lying position and unfortunately as bean slowly tips over his mouth comes into direct contact with reynolds flies
from across the compartment a hostess sees whats happening
shes shocked comes over and taps bean on the shoulder
he shoots up and nearly strangles her in shock
she calms him down shows him how to put his chair back and leaves him to sleep
reynolds still asleep
with bean asleep completely on top of him
his hand is spread on reynolds face
reynolds eyes open
he sees whats happened
his arm goes up and rings for the hostess
morning has broken
reynolds is still trying to sleep bean is wide awake
the hostess approaches and the mother of the young boy says her son isnt very well
bean decides to cheer him up
he mimes an aeroplane which makes the boy feel more ill
then does a rather good lizard impersonation by sticking bits of paper to his tongue and eye lids and fluttering them
he then brings out a scrunched up bag of dolly mixtures and does his trick of throwing a sweet in the air and catching it in his mouth
the boy is too ill to be impressed
bean tries to cheer him up with his imaginary gun pretending to be a cowboy and then a tough american cop
then he has an extremely fun idea
he empties the dolly mixtures from the paper bag and pockets them
he then blows up the empty bag and is about to pop it to wake reynolds when he sees its got a hole in it
meanwhile the boy has taken out his sick bag
bean is delighted yes thats perfect
he turns away for a split second to scrunch up the useless bag while unseen to him the boy vomits into his bag
bean turns grabs the bag from him blows into it puts it right into reynolds face at arms length and smacks his hands together
cut at just the right moment
the traditional exit area
a random bunch of people are waiting relatives limousine drivers and rather strangely three year old women dressed in curly red wigs from the musical annie
the learys are at the barrier
kevin has a cardboard sign with mr
bean written on it
people are streaming out of the arrivals gate
alison is not happy
actually no one is
jennifer looks particularly fed up
for all you know he may be a very attractive young man
oh come on the guys going to be a creep
all englishmen are ugly
what makes you say that
all the guys they claim are english to and good looking like dan day lewis and liam neeson turn out to be irish
even anthony hopkins is welsh
prince charles is so ugly they pay him two million bucks a year to stay indoors
richard burton was very good looking
okay so the guys gonna look like meatloafs backside
no ones asking you to go to bed with him
jennifer glares at him
a tired alison has had enough of this waiting already
bed sounds good though
bed sounds great
bean is off the plane
reynolds strides ahead of him a huge wet patch in a semi circle around his neck
bean comes to a moving walkways
he steps on to it sheepishly thinking its very daring and brave gripping the handrail as though he was travelling at mph
but soon he gains greater confidence
he stands up straight both hands off the rail
there are a couple of cops leaning against a wall chatting
bean notices their guns
slipping into role play mode he reaches into his breast pocket ready to bring out his imaginary shooter
the last security guard he tried this with just yawned so bean thinks its safe
but this time the cops turn and stare at him tensely
flustered by their interest in him bean needs to get away
he turns but finds that he is walking in the opposite direction on the spot
the cops read this as suspicious behaviour and move towards him suspiciously
bean turns to gets himself going in the right direction
the cops follow
the cops give chase
a little bald man arrives at the barrier
the three red wigged clones from the musical annie swamp him with shrieks and kisses
the learys are getting impatient
bored who do you think is the ugliest guy who ever lived
well michael boltons pretty grisly
i vote for bart
shut up kevin
no seriously i know hes your boyfriend but theres something about his upper lip that is so weird
what do you think it is dad
jen says its a moustache i say its a cluster of about mosquitoes resting
you know the thing i hate most about children
bean is running down the busy corridor with the two cops in pursuit
they draw their guns
two more cops appear coming from the opposite direction
bean is trapped
he drops his case
stop or we shoot
passers by scream and throw themselves to the floor
bean freezes on the spot terrified
all four cops have their guns trained on him in the shooting position
carefully take out your weapon holding the butt with two fingers only
slowly place it on the floor and take three paces back
dead slowly bean puts his hand into his inside jacket pocket and brings it back out made in the shape of a gun
he slowly transfers that imaginary item to the finger and thumb of his left hand
he bends down and places it on the floor then takes three paces back
he gives out a big breath after the effort of it all
the cops just stare at him gob smacked
little old lady from plane steers up from nowhere
she rattles her box of broken china and kicks bean in the shins
things are not going his way
bright and clinical
close on bean sitting behind a table a very small man in very big trouble
behind him two uniformed cops stand guard
a large black plain clothes detective sits opposite smoking a cigarette
this is brutus
he studies beans passport photo
its the baboon face
he holds it up to beans face to make a comparison
bean pulls the face to match the photo
are you presently on any kind of medication at all
bean thinks deeply for a moment then shakes his head
you could certainly use some
alison jennifer and kevin are slumped in seats near the barrier
david walks up
what did they say
well theyre kind of busy but it doesnt look like
did you really ask
im not sure i got the right person but they were a bit busy
whats wrong with you david
all you have to do is say excuse me ive been sitting here since the start of the millennium and id really like some action from you before the end
of the world
i try again
i said i go
kevin shakes his head disappointedly al his father
david slumps down on the seat
he overhears jennifer flirting with an incredibly undesirable bloke in a leather jacket white with rasta hair extensions and about sixty rings in his nose
this is stingo
where do your parents live
my parents are dead
david is pretty confident that he knows who killed them
yeah so are mine
cop puts bean in the back of a taxi with his case
he takes some dollar notes from his own wallet and hands them to the driver
just get him the hell out of here will ya
he slams the door and the taxi drives away
the learys are all asleep in eccentric positions on the seats
jennifers head is resting on stingos leg
kevins cardboard sign with mr
bean written on it falls from his lap to the floor
the taxi draws up outside the house
bean gets out with his case
the cab driver is strangely friendly
thanks man i cant tell you how much i appreciate talking to ya
in this job you get so many jerks spilling their guts all over ya with their stupid problems
but you youre a great listener ya know that
bean smiles politely
taxi drives away
bean walks up to the front porch checks the house number on his piece of paper and presses the doorbell
still no answer
now where have they hidden the key
he inspects things carefully
the camera sees what he sees
the doormat the flowerpot the window ledge and then he spots a little stone frog
key hiding is something he knows about and people are pathetically obvious about it
bean picks up the frog to reveal the front door key
it glints in the porch light
bean lets himself in
the pre alarm buzzer goes off quietly
he has seconds before the alarm goes off proper
he strolls confidently to where the alarm control unit obviously is
under the stairs
close up of flashing l
again bean looks carefully and finds the magnetic box housing a little key attached to the underside of the console
just as the alarm goes off for the splittest of a secondette he turns the key in its slot
and is safe
bean finds the switch and turns on the hall light
he switches it off again then on
then rapidly clicks it on and off repeatedly
shot from across the street with all the house lights flashing off and on madly
bean stands in front of the television looking a little annoyed about the fact that the remote control in his hand is having no effect at all
he stabs at it randomly
the garage doors are swinging open and closed rhythmically
kevin and jennifer are asleep in the back
david drives in silence alison next to him
david stabs at buttons on the car radio
it isnt working any more david
i know i take it in to george tomorrow hell fix it
its not working any longer you and me
davids now heard it completely
he takes his eyes off the road and stares at alison a moment too long
a cars horn snatches back his attention
i need some time david
a little time
its not just you
its partly me
but in general
mostly me right
single shot of alison and david
she doesnt answer
he is destitute
bean wanders down the stairs in his pyjamas
he sees a walkman and puts it on happily
he moves to the rhythm
he locks the door turns on the alarm and turns off the hall light
davids car turns into the drive just as the hall light goes off
for the next few minutes knife edged timing is all
the learys sleepily get out of the car and approach the house
david brings out his door key
the exact moment the key turns in the lock bean still wearing headphones disappears into a bedroom with a little ceramic sign on it saying guest the exhausted family enter
an apparently untouched house
kevin turns on the stairs light climbs to his room off the landing and closes the door on which a sign reads kevin
at that instant bean walks out looking for the bathroom with his wash bag
he looks up at the light
it should not be on
he frowns turns it off and exits to bathroom
at which precise moment jennifer zombie like is halfway up the stairs thanks a lot kevin
jennifer goes into her room
the sign reads jennifer
alison turns on the light and climbs the stairs
david heads into the kitchen
they exchange a sad look
she goes into their bedroom the sign reads grups
at which instant bean still wearing headphones leaves the bathroom and heads downstairs
the light is on
david takes a deep breath
he picks up an empty coffee jar sighs and goes into the pantry a full one
he opens the refrigerator and he studies the food on offer
nothing he fancies
he sees a little plate of strawberries
he eats one then two then pops the third into his mouth
it tastes a bit off so he takes it out of his mouth puts it back on the plate closes the fridge door and exits
just as david comes out of the pantry
close on beans hand as it comes round the door frame and turns off the light
david on the move stubs his toe on a chair
he groans in pain limps to the fridge
he spots the lone already sucked strawberry and pops it into his mouth
alison is watching t
in bed with the remote control
david enters with orange juice and puts it down by his side of the bed
the lights blown in the kitchen
ill fix it tomorrow
theyre not a happy couple
she concentrates on the tv even turns it up a little
bean turns on the basins cold faucet
it gushes noisily
close on letterman on the tv
the noise from it drowns out any noise from the bathroom
the bathroom has two doors one into david and alisons bedroom the other onto the landing
bean cant hear the t
because of his headphones
he takes out his toothbrush but notices an electric one on a shelf with spare brush heads
he swaps the heads and enjoys cleaning his teeth with this clever modern implement
he puts the electric brush down and checks his teeth in the mirror
he has forgotten to turn off the brush and so it vibrates off the sink and lands in the toilet
bean fishes it out and places it back on the shelf where he found it
he turns off faucet then exits turning out the light
david enters and turns the light on again
he takes down the toothbrush and cleans his teeth
he calls through the bedroom door
that poor guy bean
hes probably still sitting at london airport
he finishes his teeth then runs the hot faucet
he exits to bedroom as bean enters from hall with dirty socks
alison is still watching t
the volume is getting to david
bean is just finishing washing his socks in davids water
he rings the dirty water from them and exits
david enters in his under shorts
he checks his tired eyes in the mirror then washes his face in the basin water without looking
bean notices a framed photograph on the wall
it is of the leary family
they are grouped outside their house
it is a very happy picture
bean smiles at it
he takes it off the wall and takes it into a bedroom
as the door quietly closes we see the sign jennifer
lights are out
david and alison in bed
the latter is facing away
i need to make a confession
i know youre awake
please its important
long pause without stirring go ahead
i had the last strawberry in the refrigerator
alison smiles in spite of herself
she turns over and puts her arm around david
she gets up close to his face
there were three strawberries
h ali we can work this thing out you know
alison smiles sleepily and goes to kiss him
she stops and sniffs
thoroughly put off she rolls over and closes her eyes
your face smells like a foot
the next morning
shot from across the street a newspaper boy delivers
its a lovely peaceful early morning
a terrifying girls scream pierces the quiet
the whole family charges out onto the landing
jennifer hurtles out of her room screaming
she barges through the family and locks herself in the bathroom
what is it
theres a man
theres a man
theres a man in my
honey calm down now
theres a man
i woke up next to a man
it wouldnt be the first time
shut up kevin
to jennifer honey you re not making sense
theres no one out here
just open the door
then a click of the bathroom lock
jennifer comes out
then theres another click
bean breezes out of jennifers bedroom past the family in his pyjamas carrying a wash bag and a towel over his arm
he waves to them friendly slips into the bathroom and closes the door
the family stare in amazement
the family now dressed for work and school are having breakfast at the kitchen table
after an uncomfortable silence he makes prince charles look kind of handsome
he cant stay here david
its not a problem
lets just sit
i talk to the gallery
david im serious
i know you are
most of the time these days
now what does that mean
my daughter wakes up with a strange man in her bed and im supposed to think its amusing
looks at his tie that ties god awful
why do you wear it
david is thrown
he looks down at his tie
jennifer looks grumpy
kevin is eating happily
bean enters dressed carrying a plastic carrier bag
he acknowledges the family with a grunt and a smile
ah mr bean
he moves to the phone checks his watch and dials quickly
the ancient g
phone starts to ring on a small table
the following takes place in a matter of seconds
on the table are two large shiny hard backed books wedged up at one end and sloping away at right angles to one another
each book has a pair of rulers set parallel to one another in play doh
they each form a canal
between one pair of rulers sits a small box of salt
between the other pair is a miniature bust of beethoven
as the phone continues to ring and vibrate the table these items judder along the canal an inch at a time
the box of salt teaches the bottom of the book and topples over the edge of the table
the beethoven bust teeters on the edge of its book
the salt lands in a plastic funnel taped to the top of a bamboo stick
the bottom of the stick sits on the bbc button of a t
close up of its infrared l
as it flashes once
the phone stops ringing
cut to the t
comes on at the start of a documentary about grizzly bears
a voice over begins a narration
cut to close on teddy sitting in his cardboard box hotel
flickering light from the t
plays on his face
bean hangs up happily then approaches the toaster stuffs a pair of wet socks into it and pulls down the start lever
satisfied he now turns to the family
now can i help
they just stare dumb founded
david and bean arrive at the car and get in
david heads out of the drive at a reasonable speed
bean suddenly yanks on the hand brake
davids head hits the windshield with a sickening thud
bean reaches for and fastens his seat belt
he looks to david
david gives bean a pained look
what planet does he come from
he fastens his own seat belt while bean wonders why its all taking so long
its a rather fancy building
like a little guggenheim david parks by a large expensive looking car
bean opens his door and it bangs hard against the pristine body work
as bean and david enter through the swing doors they meet annie the very bubbly girl in charge of entrance tickets at the reception cum shop counter
two dollars please
annie its me
oh right yeah
to bean two dollars please
no annie no
this is doctor bean
hes going to be working with us
that word doctor
usually we charge people two dollars to come in but for people who work here that would be dollars a year which is like a lot of money so we
kinda like let them off
bean smiles at her
he doesnt like to say much does he
right first time
i can understand that
neither do i
as bean and david move on bean gives annie a ittle wave
she waves sweetly back
she cocks her head to one side and watches him go
she likes mr
bean a lot
bean and david arrive in the ground floor gallery
a few visitors are viewing the paintings
the acknowledge elmer the huge ex army security man sitting on a small chair by a wall reading a newspaper
the pass two oldish ladies inspecting a painting youll notice our clientele is not totally young
i sometimes worry theyre not really getting to grips with the art on a deep aesthetic level
stay with the ladies as david and bean head on
what do you think
h yes lovely very nice
and what colour would you use for the curtains
well i thought the sort of blue in this one
she points to a gorgeous blue matisse and i thought the curtains in the bathroom would be nice in this yellow
and they head on to a van gogh with a nice yellow in it
bean stops to admire a painting
it is pre raphaelite in style depicting a woman reclined on a bed in a castle chamber
she is wearing a chastity belt fastened with a small padlock her breasts are concealed under a draped flag
it is a tasteful and romantic picture
his mistress by john everett millais to
bean shakes his head
its the padlock hes interested in he points at it and smiles
annie walks up
mr grierson called down
hes ready to see you upstairs
annie walks off back the way she came looking at bean approvingly over her shoulder
grierson hates people being late
he gestures that held like to tidy up a little
brush his hair etc
bean waddles off after annie clearly in need of relief
david watches him go
bean is catching up with annie
she notices him following and coyly smiles to herself
she stops turns round and grins
she thinks he has come to say something to her
bean stops dead in front of her then turns sharp left into the mens washroom
annies smile fades
bean comes out of a booth
he tidies his hair and tie in a mirror
he pushes down the pressurised tap to wash his hands
it splashes terribly
the whole front of his trousers are soaked
the last thing you want when about to meet your new boss
there now follow a quick complicated piece of business
bean spots a paper towel dispenser
he turns towards it at just the moment a man exits from a booth bean turns back to the sink to hide his trousers as the man swiftly does his
hands goes to the paper dispenser and takes the last towel
bean now puts his hope in a rolling towel
but its rather high
he has to jump to try to reach the trouser
at which point another man enters
jumping bean has been caught in a very weird position
he pretends he has chosen the mens room as the place to do his rather energetic exercise routine
as the man leaves he then tries to blow the patch dry with his mouth
another man enters
again bean is compromised pretends its even more exercises
that man also enters a booth
bean suddenly notices the hand drying machine
he turns it on
a healthy blast of warm air
annoyingly its also rather too high
he tries jumping and bouncing to get his waist to the right height
its not going to work
he climbs up on two sinks
now the drier is blowing in exactly the right place
bean sways to let the air cover the whole area
its working excellently
at which moment one of the men exits from a booth and sees him in the mirror
bean is in an immensely compromising sex with machine position
he pretends hes there to change the light bulb above which he takes out calmly and polishes
the man leaves bean smiles
but as he exits beans face transforms hes totally scalded his fingers on the scorching bulb
bean rushes to the sink puts his fingers under the tap pushes on the water and soaks himself all over again
at which moment david enters exasperated
bean exits uneasily hunched to hide his wet patch
they enter the corridor and he spots a newspaper
bean and david enter
its a warm formal
on the wall behind the desk is a full size framed poster of whistlers mother
on a white background at the base of the poster a caption reads the grierson gallery home of whistlers mother
elsewhere the walls are full of paintings
grierson and bernie look up from a computer screen at david and bean who is rather weirdly carrying a newspaper in fronts of his flies
grierson approaches david and shakes his hand
checks his watch deliberately and this must be our professor from across the sea
yes this is doctor bean
actually im not
this is bernard schimmel
bernie the doctor
bernie offers his hand
bean has to do a nifty handchange to free up the correct hand for the handshake
the newspaper stays firmly in place
ah the tribune mind if i just
he reaches out to borrow the newspaper
bean has to squeeze in right next to the desk and sit behind it before he can hand the paper over thus ensuring the continued invisibility of the wet patch
grierson studies the paper for a second
take a seat gentlemen
although before we settle feast your eyes on these
grierson goes to a painting on a wall
david and bean follow bean about one inch from davids back walking in perfect rhythm
originals of course
got four of them
check this out
venus and the cat aesops fables
isnt that something
he heads towards said illustration on adjacent wall and bean and david follow still totally glued together
a strange sight
theyre beautiful sir
hell of a price i tell you
anyway down to business
they head back to the desk but bean in a momentary lapse of concentration fails to follow
hes now stuck on the wrong side of the room unable to turn around
bernie was just showing me his new ideas for a cross gallery computer system
dr bean would you like to look at this
very exciting stuff
grierson is slightly surprised
but they persevere
what im doing dave is developing the ultimate user friendly interactive public guide to the gallery
punching buttons on the computer he reveals wonderful maps of the gallery and when clicking on sections of the map graphic explanations of each rooms contents
bean has spotted a fan on the other side of the room
he moves around the room always facing straight to the wall
when he reaches the fan he switches it on unfortunately its a rotating fan so to keep the wind on his trousers bean has to do a strange rhythmic dancing
movement following the arc of the fan
its very good bernie
but the particular glory of the system
is that it can also work oh large screens in each individual room so we can network the program to every room in the gallery
not bad eh
what do you think doctor
bean turns shocked to have been observed
he looks down at his trousers and hooray
theyre dry at last
hes delighted and moves back across the road towards them hands in pockets in a big confident groin thrusting dry trouser boasting walk
well thanks for dropping by
enjoy your stay with our vice president and his family
theyre simple people
but warm yes doctor
im not actually
settled in yet
plenty of time
bernie perhaps youd like to take dr
bean on a tour of the gallery
this way sir
bean displays his crotch proudly one last time before he and bernie exit
grierson tries to fathom the strange man who just left
hes a genius right
he certainly has something sir
very pleased youve taken him in david
at a time when no ones job is safe it really identifies you as a team player
yes although i really
yes its great to have him with us
the whole familys very excited
glad to hear it
tell poor mr larson to come through will you
youre not going to
david what else can i do
this business is not repeat not breaking even
notice anything this morning
david frowns then sees
youve tinted your hair
it takes years off you sir
end of the day
annie perks up at the reception desk as david but especially bean approaches from the gallery area
she has a pile of tissues near by and draws a heart on one of them
she arranges it on the counter top where bean could not fail to see it on his way to the exit
bean does not even notice her
as david heads for the exit bean suddenly sneezes
he reaches for annies love message and blows his nose on it
he drops the tissue in a bin as he exits
annie sighs her disappointment
bean and david head for the parking lot
on the way beans interest is drawn to the mime artist we met before in his clinton mask performing his heart out in front of the dead cars sculpture
the mime accosts a woman pretending to brush dust from her clothes comb her hair etc
the mime is a bit of a pain in the ass really
the woman quickly moves on
bean is intrigued
the mime mimes climbing a ladder
bean goes up next to him and looks up
theres nothing there
he decides the mime is a bit of a tricky
this is confirmed when the mime pretends hes locked behind a pane of glass
bean simply pokes his finger through the imaginary glass wall and hits the mimes nose
cut to david watching bemusedly some way off
the mime is however delighted someone is taking an interest at last
he takes a handkerchief from beans pocket and gets bean to guess which hand the hankys in
its not in the left
not in the right
bean isnt the slightest bit impressed he just reaches round and takes the hank y from where its tucked into the mimes trousers and heads away
as he moves off the mime touches h on the shoulder
bean turns and the mime starts a mocking gun duel
he draws his guns
bean is pretty unimpressed
the mime turns his back and walks the paces to draw
but now bean decides to settles it once and for all
in a brilliant piece of big mime he puts together the biggest gun ever seen outside an arnold schwarzenegger movie
he sets up a pedestal opens a case lifts out a hugely heavy gun then the bits that click on that gun
then opens another case and takes out the huge artillery shell to load it
the mime is getting very frightened
then bean pulls up an imaginary stool to sit behind his mega gatling gun
the mime begins to run away
bean twirls in his imaginary seat and lines up his sights following the terrified mime
finally in a boom that almost knocks bean out of his imaginary seat he fires
seconds delay and the mime falls in a very dramatic death yards away
bean is happy and heads back to the parking lot where david arms folded leans against his car
david gets into his car
bean opens the passenger door and thumps it loudly into the side of the expensive car next door same as this morning
david parks next to a beaten up convertible
ill get some steaks
alison loves steak
alison hates candy
we gotta do this right bean or
looks at bean just stay out of trouble okay
david gets out and heads for the mall
nearby woman tramp bag lady goes through a trash can
bean tries to control himself but weakens
he plays with all the buttons and switches on the dashboard windshield wipers lights
then he notices a throbbing noise
he gets out of the car to investigate
bean swiftly locates the throbbing sound
the e empty convertible has its engine running
bean notices the keys in the ignition
how stupid of someone
he turns off the engine and takes out the keys
there are several people returning to their cars with groceries
bean offers the car keys to them as if to say are these yours
the following should take place at quite a speed real drama
then suddenly a robber dashes towards bean from the direction of the mall weaving in and out of parked cars with a small white carrier bag assumedly full of money
he wears jeans a black polo neck and much to beans delight a president clinton face mask
as far as beans concerned this is his old friend the mime
robber throws the bag of money on to the back seat of the convertible and gets in but he cant find the keys to start it
he frantically searches all his pockets
bean leans into shot
he holds out the keys grinning
gimme the keys
bean runs away with them
he is in mime mode and runs on the spot getting faster and faster
the robber approaches this obvious madman
he is quite a tough scary and scared individual
i said give me the keys
bean turns and holds out two hands just like the mime did to him
the perplexed robber picks one hand
pulls a gun and puts it hard to mr bean in beans face
passers by scream and fall to the ground the bag lady amongst them
sudden harsh reality
but not to bean
he simply takes the gun and waves it in the robbers face ticking him off for breaking the rules
bean gestures the robber to turn around
he does sure this sicko is going simply to shoot him in the head
but instead bean puts his back to the robbers back and starts to count he turns and gestures to the robber its time to draw
by this time a crowd has gathered
but i havent got a f
he points out a small child watching from behind a trash can
david is hurrying back to the parking lot with a bag of groceries and a big bunch of red roses
he stops dead in his tracks as he spots something
alison and charles are sitting up on stools in the window of a coffee shop
alison laughs at something that charles says
their body language suggests a certain closeness
david is saddened
he hurries away
bean waves the gun at the robber
i havent got a gun
but bean is pushing him to draw
okay okay i do it
bean draws too
and bean really fires
to his amazement
bean throws the gun away in startlement
the robber lunges for it bean kicks it away trying to help him avoid such a dangerous implement
the robber lunges at bean who throws the keys away over his shoulder
the robber has to scrabble under a car for them bean thinks of final joke and niftly swaps the robbers bag for one of the old bag ladys bags
a few dollar notes spill out of it
when the robber emerges with the keys bean s waiting to escort him to his car
he opens the door then spots a tourist hiding and puts his arm around the robber and gets him to take a photograph of them
bean removes the robbers mask as the picture is taken
forgetting himself the robber smiles for the camera
the robber jolted back to reality by the sound of approaching police car sirens jumps in the car and drives away
bean waves goodbye to the convertible as a couple of police cars screech up
cops jump out
david approaches the scene with groceries and roses
what kind of hell has bean caused now
but instead of trouble he sees the passers by are getting to their feet applauding bean and whistling
they crowd round the cops explaining what a hero bean has been
bean hands over the gun to a cop
he doesnt really understand what all the fuss is about
he notices the bag lady wandering away with her bags
should he tell her that he has swapped one of them for the robbers
hes getting too much attention to be bothered
a cop comes up to bean
it is cop from the airport scene
sudden mutual recognition
classic smoked filled room with street light cutting through half closed venetian blinds
two or three detectives slouched in the shadows
brutus the huge black detective from earlier sits opposite bean at a table smoking
he is looking at a photo
a close up reveals it to be a full length one of bean and the robber outside the mall with the robbers face unmasked
brutus eyes bean for a while
bean is terrified
brutus taps the photo
its eddie guardino
go pick him up
one of the detectives lazily leaves the room
brutus leans forward on his elbows
guardino fled the scene with k in a white plastic bag
we got the car
we got the bag
and we got pairs of stinking pantyhose
drags on his cigarette anything you wanna tell me
bean looks at h m blankly
brutus holds up the photo
fraid im gonna have to keep this
bean calmly takes the picture and tears it in half
he gives back the robber half and puts the other half with himself on into his pocket
brutus glares at him
you lookin to stay long in california
a question he can answer
he nods happily
david is talking to kevin
bean is there
in the background jennifer plays with a computer game
david is very animated
he was incredible
this guy is fearless
he has no fear
thats one way of looking at it
you might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain
well there is that
i give you a chance
know anything about computers
kevin is playing an adventure game goblins this game exists
the goblins chuckle and make stupid noises that bean can imitate
a catchy piece of music accompanies the game
the computer monitor shows the inside of the wizards house
kevin moves the goblins and two little characters fingus and winkle around the room by clicking on areas in the room with his mouse
bean and kevin are both wearing pointed goblin hats made from newspaper
its so embarrassing
all the guys i know are on goblins and im still stuck with the lousy wizard in goblins
bean is interested in the computer because he likes the cute little goblins
he gets his delighted face right up to the screen
he sings along with the catchy tune
kevin is getting frustrated
come on winkle
kevin clicks on a cuckoo clock in the wizards room
the cuckoo pops out holding a key in its beak
its gotta be here
something to get the key away from the stupid cuckoo
bean scans the monitor screen he spots a little frog at the bottom of the scene
his eyes light up
he takes the mouse and rapidly and repeatedly clicks on the frog
click click click click click
the frog croaks and jumps off a little round stone
kevin gets excited
howd you do that
that was so obvious
bean grins and makes winkle pick up the stone
then he clicks through to inside the wizards house
he makes winkle throw the stone at the cuckoo which instantly drops the key from its beak
beanie you are waaaaay cool
kevin slaps bean on the back
bean is delighted
close on monitor showing the goblin game another game
jennifers super nintendo game on tv in the lounge area
it is a gothic game where he man types attack vampires and bats with swords
david is in the kitchen setting out the roses in a vase
the door opens enter alison
and i have a wine for dinner that will kill you
she settles a little you said youd ask grierson about putting our guest somewhere else
sort of half
i was sort of half way through the sentence in which i would have asked him when it suddenly seemed like a mistake
honestly david youre so spineless
jennifer looks around
she cant help but hear
not a happy experience
he is asking her for softness
at which moment bean enters wearing pointy hat
he helps himself to a melon from a bowl
he grins and exits
alison looks at david sadly
but no real change
almost instantly bean is back
he rummages through a drawer and takes out some large elastic bands
i really do need some time on my own
away from here
look beans history
i swear to you hes packing as we speak
and you cant leave
he picks up the bambi ive got bambi
you never go anywhere without him
please lets just talk
ghost of a smile put bambi down and well talk
he puts bambi down on the side table on the flat surface of his cd player
bean appears again behind her now looking even madder
pointy hat large pointy ears made from melon peel held in place by the rubber band stretched round his face huge front teeth also cut from the melon
he grins gleefully
david and alison just stare
bean is followed by kevin who wears the same ears and teeth
look you guys could you just give us a moment to
jennifer could you turn that damn thing down
it is quite loud
jennifer looks for the remote control
bean helpfully picks up a remote control from the sofa and points it across the room
no thats not for the tv
thats for the
bean punches a button and the lid of the cd player launches the bambi into the air
david sees it
in slow motion he dives dramatically and just misses it
it smashes on the floor
bean raises his eyes heavenwards shakes his head and tuts
he thinks david is a real butter fingers
jennifer upset has found the tv remote and unintentionally switches from the vampire game to a tv channel
its very loud
alison gives david a tearful look and shakes her head
a taxi drives away
alison is in it
jennifer and kevin are in their night clothes
they sit with david on the stairs still looking at the door alison left through
i wish i could use that at school
hey teach no hard feelings
its just things between us aint what they used to be and i need a little space ya know
so i see you around in a couple of years maybe
its a kind of an interesting swap
mom for the man from ga ga
she gets up and walks away
jen you dont wanna talk about it
its you and mom that need to talk
you know mr
youre not gonna kick him out are you dad
of course he is
yes i am
david heads for mr beans room and knocks cautiously on the door
david enters camera follows as david finds his way through beans washing hanging from strings across the room
bean is sticking things in a picture album
hi am i disturbing you
bean gives him an affable smile
in a pause before he quite gathers himself to broach the difficult subject david asks a polite question
he starts from the beginning with pictures of him as a kid
always standing on his own
picture of bean with mop of frizzy hair at
bean mimes stupid disco dancing
david turns another page
it is a sequence of pictures of bean at famous uk locations big ben stonehenge buckingham palace downing street
idiosyncratic because all taken by him at arms length with his polaroid so he never quite makes it squarely into shot
a whole page of teddy
then three pages of beans mini with dates on labels going way back
then a whole page of garden gnomes
none of your folks here family
bean starts to look for something in particular
david uses the pause to broach the awful subject
the reason i came in here was to
since youve been here twelve all
bean has found what he was looking for
it is the picture of the family that he took from the landing on his first night here
whats left of the polaroid of himself from the mall that he rescued from brutus is stuck next to it
hes even written bean family he doesnt realise theres anything sad about it
but david is rather moved
well thats er
look i just came in
no he cant do it
to say good night
david smiles and goes to the door
be an waves good bye a little rudely and gets back to the album
even when we feel sorry for him hes a little rude
david walks away shaking his head
the first morning without alison
shes gone by hall oats begins to play a song full of yearning
david feels the other side of the bed
no one there
he walks into the bathroom and turns on the shower
then walks back into the bedroom shes gone ive got to learn how to face it he takes a towel from a cupboard and returns to the bathroom
he feels very alone
he removes his pyjamas and gets into the steam filled shower
shes gone shes gone but the camera moves to reveal that he is not alone after all
bean has simply entered the shower and is now happily soaping himself wearing alisons shower cap
manly screams from the both of them
david sitting down at table with bean who is tucking in happily eating a burger bun with knife and fork
david speaks after a longish pause
bean can i ask you something
do you think you can ever really know someone
even if youve known them well almost all your life
what do you think
bean thinks hard then looks at his watch makes his excuses and simple walks away
bean at a pay phone
he dials carefully am u
the following takes place in a matter of seconds close on the t
a morning kids show blares out
a huge wardrobe stands four feet away from a wall
there is a string tied to one of its door handles stretching out of shot
the wardrobe seems to be leaning backwards at an angel
it rocks slightly and creaks
feature its padlock
there is a folded ironing board balanced over a roll of hall carpet see saw fashion
one end of it is wedged under the wardrobe
phone rings on the table and its vibrations cause the bust of beethoven to fall over the edge of the table
it lands on the end of the ironing board
the wardrobe groans as it is set off balance and falls against the wall with a heavy thump
and raising of dust
the string tied to its handle becomes taut
cut to the t
plug in its socket
this end of the string is tied to it
the string tightens and the plug is yanked out of the socket
screen goes blank
shot of teddy in the cardboard hotel
bean returns sits down and starts to eat again
david is still deep in thought
well they say theres only one way to get over this sort of thing
take it day by day
keep to your normal patterns
thats the only hope
so lets just
take today shall we
he is not on davids emotional level here
i think the time has come from you to meet the grand madame
shes all around you
how do you fancy meeting her in the flesh
sure enough all around are posters and the silhouette of whistlers mother
bean nods though fairly distracted by the slice of gherkin hes found in his bun and now picks out with his fingers
bean and david en route to the painting
i usually only let her out for the big summer exhibition but lets see whether what they say about the healing power of great works of art is true huh
bean and david do the rest of the journey in quick cuts along corridors in an elevator
a sense of expectation and excitement
en route they are joined by elmer the huge security guard
the three arrive outside a large oak door
elmer ceremoniously unlocks the door all the time glaring at bean who swallows hard
a light turns green and a buzzer sounds
then there is the door to the inner sanctum
elmer stares at bean as he unlocks it
another light turns green and another buzzer sounds
as you can see securitys pretty tight in this section
nobody gets past elmer here
isnt that right
not in one piece anyway
i see mrs whistler as kind of
like my own dear mother
id kill any man that tried to interfere with her
the vice president here will vouch for that
youve known me five years elmer
when do you get to calling me david
not my place sir
it would only be a matter of time before im calling you dave
then where would we be
by next year youre my sweety pie and im coochie coo
i be back in
he salutes glares at bean and walks away
bean and david enters the room
bean looks warily back at elmer you think hes tough you should see the size of the hunk that works the night shift
the room is very dark only tiny lights in the corner
keep your eyes closed
one final lock one final key
david unlocks double doors in a wall with a plastic key card
the camera holds on bean his eyes tight shut
the lights go up on beans face a magical golden glow
cut round and there is this beautiful and very famous painting lovingly shot
bean opens his eyes and looks at the painting
i leave you with her for a few minutes
im sure youll want to give her a proper inspection
but whatever you do dont leave the room
david leaves him
bean is still for a while and then goes up and inspects it closely
he tuts disapprovingly as he spots dust on the bottom of the frame
he blows it away fussily
he steps back to admire the painting
there is dust up his nose and
sneeze all over the painting
he takes out his handkerchief and wipes the spittle off in panic
then looks back at the painting
unfortunately there now seems to be a big blue mark right across mrs whistlers face
bean checks his handkerchief
yes theres wet ink all over it
he finds the leaking pen in his pocket
he takes out his shirt spits on it and tries to wipe the painting but he cant make the shirt reach it
he takes the painting down from the wall and has another go
the ink just spreads right over whistlers mothers pure white collar
bean now looks round in panic
what the hell can he do
he goes to the heavy door and looks out into the corridor
he hears someone coming hides and sees a young girl from the catering staff wheeling a slightly squeaky trolley past covered with a white cloth
he goes back in and has an idea
he goes to a little table in the corner and begins to take thing off it
the door opens and bean emerges pushing what appears to be a trolley covered with a white cloth
although if you look carefully this trolley actually has no legs
it is the painting covered with the table cloth
to make it a bit more convincing bean makes an apt squeaky noise
he proceeds along the thin corridor and then sees another exactly similar trolley coming right towards him
as they get close bean suddenly pretends he sees something astonishing behind the on coming man
silently mouths what the
when the man turns bean just twists his painting sideways and shoots past him
we see the face of the deeply perplexed trolley pusher when he looks back and bean is no longer there
he turns round to bean who turns back to him with a totally blank and innocent look
bean sees an elevator and heads for it
inside the elevator bean relaxes for a moment
he leans the painting against the wall and presses the third floor button
the bell dings
bean manages to get the painting into trolley position before the doors open to a group of six very fat middle aged people
they all wear large badges declaring them to be members of a diet club
they squeeze into the elevator along both sides of beans trolley
there is a very very thin woman behind them who cant fit on
i guess ill see you up there guys
the doors close
as the painting is wedged against the fat peoples stomachs on both sides bean is able to let go of it and make a great show of checking his watch
he nonchalantly drums the fingers of both hands on the top of the trolley
the bell dings
the doors open
bean flips the painting onto its side and strolls out of the elevator
the diet cub members stare after him
bean heads on squeaking and at last sees what hes looking for
a mens room
bean enters relieved
it is small just a little sink a towel and a toilet
about a yard wide but the picture fits in
bean starts to wash the painting very carefully and lo
the ink starts to come off
then alas someone tries the handle of the door
bean speeds up
he peers out the keyhole
there are now people waiting
bean is very worried
then out comes bean drying his empty hands miming sorry sorry
we see into the toilet
no sign of the painting
bean turns sharply left
david is talking to bernie in the grounds
we can see the side of the whole gallery in shot as they talk
i was hoping du
bean might take a look at my computer project today
i mention it to him
hes kind of his own guy you know
howls he getting on with the family
we will be slightly distracted by the observation that whistlers mother americas most valuable painting is at this moment balanced on a very thin ledge three floors up where bean
has put in outside the mens room window
a bird and then a couple more birds perch on it
and howls alison
well shes good
saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers
yes isnt he
its great when people who work together can become real friends
i like to think thats whats happened with you and me
even though youre kinda my boss
still maybe it wont always be that way huh
david doesnt quite see what bernie is getting at but smiles politely
now we see beans plan he has emerged at a nearby window
he cant reach the painting at first
so he stretches further and further out the window
finally he has to go out on the ledge
he shoos away the birds who then decide to settle on him instead
finally he gets a hand on the painting
as he does so he loses hold
he just manages to grabs a window before he falls
look ive left bean on his own
nice to chat though bernie always a subtle joy
always a pleasure
bean is slowly managing to claw his way back towards the open window with the painting
it is an extraordinary piece of acrobatics
david turns to go
by the way
dont know what you think mr vice president but ive been hinting to the old man that someones got to have the balls to take some sort of emergency measures
around here or were all in the crap house
what do you think
emergency measures in your book means sack people right
thats where this
points to his brain comes in
no ive had a better idea than sacking people
youll hear soon enough
bernie grins and walks away
bean does one final swing and
a small storeroom where beans wriggling bottom is just coming back through the window
he has the picture and is safe
he sets the picture down on a table
the birds have done their business on it
he maniacally rummages through various dusty cans and bottles on a shelf
he chooses a can too rusty to read its label takes off the lid and sniffs
this smells like the right sort of stuff
he pours the liquid on to a rag and rubs it on the face of mrs
the solvent effortlessly removes the ink stain
whistlers mother looks as good as new
bean is so so relieved
but then he notices something else happening
the liquid did not stop with removing the stain
it is now busy removing whistlers mothers face entirely
as bean watches in frozen horror americas most famous painting turns back to a blank canvas
bean thinks for a second and then has a desperate thought
removing the pen that started all the trouble he decides to try to draw back on whistlers mothers face
he doesnt have much time
where once was a sublime oil painting is now a biro line drawing which looks a little like danny de vito
bean lifts it against the wall to check how its worked
unfortunately theres a nail there
the picture tears bean panics it tears even more
bean hurries down the corridor with his pseudo trolley again and a vaguely mad look on his face
he spots annie at a drinks machine
she smiles sweetly here comes her man bean takes a sharp left into an adjacent corridor
annie is hurt
true love can be very hard
close on the double doors identical to those of the whistler room bean enters with the painting under the cloth
he closes the doors and rests a moment to catch his breath
he takes a step into the room and freezes
the very fat diet club people are seated at easels paint brushes poised
the very thin woman is standing in the centre of the room in her underwear with a greek urn perched on her shoulder
all eyes are on bean who exits very quickly
bean gets back to the right rooms and closes the door desperately behind him
he stands frozen for a second and at that moment a hand tries the door
bean leaps at it and stops
the handle turning
then theres a knock
bean moves the big table in front of the door hes barricading himself in
theres a famous rodin sculpture in there he shoves it along to block the door as well
when hes succeeded he leans hot and sweaty against it and a door on the other side of the room calmly opens and
david walks in
seems to be a problem with the door
pause wheres the picture gone
bean finally shows it
not a pretty sight
oh jesus god
oh mary mother of jesus
oh jesus of nazareth
setting himself up for an interesting comprehensive answer
dont bother panicking oh my god
he rushes to the door he just came in and locks it
wait a minute why am i worrying about this
i did it
i just go out and tell them what happened youre a madman from england and you did this terrible thing and its not my fault
thats right isnt it
bean nods knowing he deserves his doom
perfect and then they say who left him alone with the picture
and i say me
and they say youre fired
and i say right
and so i get fired and you go to jail and no ones any happier
bean shakes his head
and then they say firing david isnt enough lets prosecute him for negligence
and they prosecute me and it turns out i was negligent and i go to jail and my wife leaves me and my daughter becomes a prostitute and i end
up on death row sharing a cell with butch mcdick the infamous gay rapist or worse i end up in the same cell as you
bean looks hurt
now lets just be calm lets think about this calmly
he tries and fails
okay now wait
lets have another look at it
bean shows it to him
im already thinking back to minutes ago as paradise
minutes ago just walking along shooting the breeze with my old pal bernie
bean then he has a brilliant idea
he hangs the painting back up in the security cupboard and closes the doors
then he removes from his pocket a small note book
he scribbles something on it tears the page out licks it and sticks it on the cupboard door
it reads out of order
bean is delighted
apart from the tiny drawback that the first person who opens the cupboard will say look someones totally destroyed whistlers mother lets kill them
bean is less delighted
no the most important thing is tbat no one sees it
he locks the cupboard with his plastic card key thats the first thing
thats the first thing
next is the next thing which is
look lets get out of here
try to act natural
the let themselves out and go into the corridor bean acting his version of natural very liquid
they bump straight into grierson and elmer
bean our good lady
actually im not a
thats right whistlers mother
looking at his mother not his father not interested in his father couldnt give a flying doughnut for his sisters or brothers just his mother
well good think i may go and look at her myself
pray tell me why
because theyve just cut her into tiny pieces sir
bean and david die and go to hell until elmer laughs at his own little joke
grierson laughs too
i better continue my rounds sir
he strolls away
the thing is sir ive just been giving the painting a very thorough inspection with the help of dr bean here and we feel the times come for whistlers mum
to have her first face lift
time taken its toll on the old girl eh
shes in a surprisingly terrible state
isnt she bean
whistler was a great painter but he wasnt a great chooser of paints
bean hudders at the thought of his paint choosing
the colours are beginning to fade
however if you give me just one little year i can restore the picture to its original glory the way it looked when whistlers mom first looked at it and
actually im not sure youve got the hair right darling
by the way your hair is looking great today sir
thank you david
however flattery will get you nowhere
truth is i have a rather different plan for whistlers dear mama
bernie and i have been inspecting our books and the long and short of it is we cannot survive with our current losses so
you have to sack me
i understand sir
ill go quietly
in fact ill go right now
no no hold on
we cant sustain our loses so ive decided
to sell whistlers mother
david lets out a little yelp
i already have a prospective buyer the current governor of california no less who is flies in tomorrow to inspect her and clinch the deal
spread the news
i think decisive leadership has done the trick dont you
david turns to bean
do you drink
bean shakes his head
neither do i
it is very late and very gloomy
just a couple of loners staring into their drinks
the bartender is up one end of the counter smoking and reading the sports pages
there is a t
on above the bar showing baseball
bean and david are sitting up at the bar
the latter has had far too much whisky and looks the worse for it
bean has a tall glass packed with fruit and paper umbrellas
we can guess how much hes had to drink by the way he has difficulty finding the straw with his mouth
david almost but not quite slurs his words its just a matter of acceptance isnt it
lose your job lose you wife
cest la vie
you ever been married bean
he turns to bean who has the end of a straw up his nose
i guess not
he fills his glass from a bottle
you know i dont get it
the new artist exhibition this year people might not all have liked the dead sheep but
the place didnt look that empty to me
it wasnt full but i saw people
i just dont understand how the gallery can be so bankrupt they have to sell the whistler
he looks at bean who now has peanuts in each nostril
david notices the bartender looking at bean strangely
hes english okay
you wanna make something of it
bartender goes back to reading
david searches for his last train of thought taking a huge swig from his drink
to hell with the figures
im not a damn accountant
im an artist
you know me and ali met in art school
i cut quite a figure then
far cry from the man you see before you now
then i smoked gitanes before i went to bed to help me sort out the problems of the world
now i take a spoonful of laxative before i go to bed to help me sort out the problem with my bowels
bean at that moment is keen to show david his nut trick
he throws a peanut high into the air and catches it in his mouth
then does two
then does it with his eyes closed
actually its rather impressive
truth is i disappointed her
i turned out to have no spine
a kind of medical miracle
mr flippy floppy
i just dont seem to be able to fight cant stick up for myself
i mean i should never have let you come stay and i should be handing you over to the police right now
shall i tell you something beanie
bean has been interested all this even looking to check whether david does indeed have no spine
but now the baseball on the tv is making it hard for him to concentrate on this important confidence
he raises a finger for david to be quiet for a second
he blows a peanut from his nostril at the t
it hits the button and changes station to a pleasant quiet music station
do you want to know what the reality of the situation is
bean nods his head very curious listening hard
this is it
because you moved into my house my wife has left me
she might have done it anyway but you were the ten ton weight that broke the camels spinal column
bean stares at david something is getting in hes actually registering this
thats point one
and point two is that youve destroyed whistlers mother which was the last hope for the place where i work
so within a week im going to lose my job as well
bean nods seriously dispirited
so youve totally and utterly destroyed my life
do you understand
youve put me in a position where it would have been better if id never been born
he puts his hand on beans shoulder
bean looks down
this is actually the first time in his life that hes realised that his actions have really effected the life of another person
bean looks up sadly
sad music plays
david is asleep in bed
the camera moves out into the hall and into beans room
bean is lying fully dressed in the darkness on his back
worried by what hes heard
then suddenly an idea comes into his eyes
the music is like his brain he jumps off the bed
there follows a version of the classic tooling up for action sequence
but the tools here are distinctly bizarre
bean picks up his suitcase and in quick cuts rushes through the house and collects
fully tooled he snaps the suitcase shut
the building is floodlit by ground spots
bean arrives silently with suitcase on the skateboard
soon his full plan will be revealed
the gallery is empty apart from the one security guard buck visible through the glass front of the building drinking coffee watching his security monitors
bean swallows at the sight of buck he is a massive gorilla of a man
buck is casually watching his screens when suddenly horror of horror the huge silhouette of a person hanging
themselves from a tree outside appears the shadow of the limp body thrown across the floodlit gallery wall
buck frantically rushes out
and bean subtly slips in
buck is looking for the body amongst the trees
he finds nothing
because he fails to notice the tiny action man swinging gently in front of one of the ground level floodlights
inside bean is casually pouring the entire contents of davids large laxative tin into bucks coffee
he also swaps two keys on the board of keys by the desk
he then takes the opportunity to put the oven gloves on his feet one shaped like a pig one like a crocodile so he can move silently
he sits down and takes a long gulp of coffee
buck feels something uncomfortable in his stomach
he takes a key from his rack of keys and sets off and rounds a corner on a monitor screen bean watches him break into a canter as he passes
through another monitor buck is at full sprint
bean is satisfied hell be uninterrupted for a while
he goes to the key rack borrows two keys and sets off on his mission
the next minutes of film are a sequence of cuts between three scenarios first buck his next minutes are not happy ones
when he reaches the toilet the key he chose does not unlock it
he has to sprint back grab all the keys and charge back again to the door
then he has to try out every single key
we never see him find the right one
second scenario all the activities of the night shown on the security monitors
buck sprinting desperately through shot bean casually going about his business and on one occasion buck running right past bean but not seeing him he has other things on his
third scenario we actually see beans big plan
he unlocks the merchandise shop
so he can see properly and have his hands free he puts the y fronts on his head and wedges the torch into them like a head lamp
he then takes a poster of whistlers mother and replaces it with the rolled up tennis ball girl
he unrolls the whistler and places the encyclopaedias on its corners to hold it down
he separates the yokes from the eggs mixes the whites with clear nail varnish and varnishes the poster with it
dries it off with the hair drier
with the now stiff poster he heads up elevators and escalators to get to the whistler room itself all the time chewing gum frantically
once there he unlocks the final cupboard with davids plastic key takes the whistler down and removes the destroyed mother from its gilded frame and its wooden support frame
he uses the chewed gum to stick the new one down to the old frame
he then puts the very convincing forgery back into the security cupboard and relocks it with davids key card
the job is done
he scrunches up the old torn picture pops it in a dustbin and heads off
bean zipping along on the skate board with his suitcase
buck trouserless is sitting reading a newspaper next to a noisy washing machine
bean lies back in bed with quiet satisfaction
david wakes with a violent start
tell it vas a dream
the door swings open
it is bean with a tray of coffee and toast
it wasnt a dream was it
i have to go in to work and tell them whistlers mother now looks like danny de vito
he laughs cheerily
bean is still chuckling
still highly amused bean guides david in the direction of whistlers room
david takes out his key to open the room but the door swings open
david is shocked
there stands grierson looking straight at whistlers mum
in all its untorn unsmudged undestroyed glory
i think youre wrong david
she looks as fine as shes ever looked
worth every cent of the million dollar s
lets put on a good show tomorrow shall we
dont want anything to go wrong
quite right sir
david gets close to the painting and peers
wait a minute
bean just puts his finger to his mouth
he lets out a hug smile he can solve the problems of the world as well as create them
jennifer skips down t he stairs carrying a trendy duffel bag just as david enters from the kitchen
jennifer i need you to watch kevin
but jennifer has already reached the front door
be serious dad
jennifer is heading down the path
david runs out of the house and catches up with her
jen you have to help me here
ive got to go in to work and with your mom away
i really need you
a powerful motorbike turns into the drive at speed and skids round to face the opposite direction
jennifer runs over to it
the bikes rider turns off his engine and removes his helmet
it is stingo the white rasta from the airport with the hair extensions and the sixty rings in his nose
to david you
he hands jennifer a helmet
dont worry dad
ill be home
monday after school
bean and kevin arrive at davids side to spectre
hey en nice bike but remember any kids you have are gonna look just like its handsome driver
angry now jennifer
this is not repeat not
how we do things in this family
ive told you never to get on one of those death traps
please talk to me
i promise to be reasonable
jennifer has put on the helmet and is climbing onto the back of the bike
you promised youd get rid of him
points at bean and as for how we do things in this family
we dont have a family till you get mom back
she slaps stingo on the shoulder
stingo kicks the starter lever
come on sting
sounds like something you put on a rash
stingo is still kicking the starter
david is desperate
dont just stand there bean do something
bean instantly takes on the heros mantle and runs to the bike
david is not far behind him
stingo is still trying to kick start it
bean takes out a small screwdriver and twiddles with something on the engine
the bike sparks into life and does a wheelie before speeding out of the drive and down the road
bean stands hands on hips looking very pleased with himself indeed
to bean right
you get inside and look after kevin
not such a good idea uh right
you get inside and look after
that would be a worse idea right
get in the car
both of you
david bean and kevin at the reception desk
hows it going
you wanna adopt me
annie smiles cutely at bean
david is still rattled
big day today huh
david looks askance at bean
bernie hurries up and takes david to one side
at last we can start getting out of debt and concentrating on the future
yes look i wanted to talk to you about this
im sure we havent been doing as badly as all that
youre an innocent and an optimist david thats why i love you
he hugs him and laughs
jesus what a terrible tie come on the governors coming at
and before then i have a little surprise for you and the boss
david calls to annie
would you look after kevin
and kevin you look after bean
he heads off with bernie
back at the counter
bean kevin annie
my dad told me all about you
did he now
he says youve got a babe count of ten out of ten and a brain cell count of about two and a half
yeah ill go with that
im kinda like dumb intellectually
to bean but im great in bed
bean is unsettled by this
he gives a shudder and heads for the gallery
catch you later babe
goes after bean come on beanie there must be a computer here somewhere
i hate paintings
they dont do anything
bernie david and grierson
bernie looks very confident at a computer monitor
a painting is in fact doing something on the computer screen as the girls in a toulouse lautrec painting actually dance the can can
isnt that great david
well be able to start this afternoon
i pipe the guide to every video screen in the gallery
now thatll impress the governor
what with you and whistlers ma i think ive got a winning team
david slightly embarrassed not to be included in the winning team
he looks to the poster of whistlers mother behind griersons desk
kevin and bean have found a computer also showing bernies gallery programme
the monitor shows the interior of the ground floor of the gallery
kevin clicks and up comes the same toulouse lautrec picture
as kevin works the mouse bean hums the catchy tune from goblins
its play time again
this is way cool beanie
he clicks again and a tiny talking toulouse lautrec starts to explain the provenance of the painting
david is overseeing things
theres a burgundy rope keeping people a bit away from the case in which whistlers mother is contained
elmer brings in two large flower displays
hurry up you guys
am i the only person round here who actually gets things done
bernie is growing in confidence and getting nastier by the minute
david pulls a face at elmer
you arrange those flowers yourself
learn it in the army
no but when youve torn out a mans throat with your bare hands you learn to appreciate the beautiful things in life
the final touches in the preparation for the big visit to up tempo were getting ready music
gardeners gardening window cleaners cleaning polishers polishing etc
and someone empties a dustbin in the midst of which we glimpse something which might be a scrunched up old whistler painting
bernie watches as someone plugs in a plug and a huge video screen in the gallery flickers and starts up
annie at her counter reading a book called the art of conversational
she shakes an imaginary hand and rehearses a keen conversation with an imaginary v
elmer in the mens room mirror trims his hair around his peaked hat with scissors
he has a row of war medals on his chest
he polishes them proudly with his sleeve
grierson watches through the front glass a red carpet rolls itself out from the gallerys main entrance to stop by the rear door of a black car
close on the bottom of the black cars rear door
it opens and a pair of legs wearing black shoes and charcoal trousers step out onto the red carpet
as they walk purposely up the carpet the camera pans up their owners body to reveal that this is bernie
its a rehearsal
he is met with a hand shake by grierson at the main entrance
what a pleasure governor reynolds
id like you to meet some of our staff here
checks a prompt card
and thats where you introduce me to the governor
gallery staff wait all wearing name badges
grierson leads bernie to the reception counter
annie steps out from behind it and shakes bernies hand
good day governor reynolds
are you kidding
this is s america
women dont curtsy they run the damn country
thats annie sir
grierson takes bernie on to elmer who is next in line
this is elmer our longest serving
lets junk the medals elmer
this is not a veterans reunion
we wanna make the governor feel at home
not remind him of piles of dead people wearing uniforms
elmer puts on a defiant face
david shakes his head disapprovingly
grierson moves bernie to meet david
they shake hands
id like to echo my colleagues welcome to you and thank you for your patronage
bernie rudely cuts him off
okay thatll do
the governors here in half an hour
we have to be totally ready then
thank you bernie
now if youll excuse i have a little smartening up to do myself
bean at the computer
hes actually quite enjoying himself now
in fact hes rather hogging the thing
this is after all an animated catalogue his area
im just gonna go see if annie needs me for anything
truth is she smells kinda nice
bean smiles and gives kevin a thumbs up
kevin returns the gesture and exits
back to the computer bean clicks on an icon which takes him to the ground floor gallery
he clicks through various paintings and stops at the painting of the woman in the castle wearing the chastity belt
bean clicks and enlarges the painting to fill the screen
he happily hums the catchy tune from goblins and homes in on the tiny padlock on the chastity belt
padlocks interest him
he clicks on the keyhole rapidly as we have seen him do with the frog in goblins
suddenly to beans surprise the padlock starts to flash red
then the whole screen starts to flash
before going dramatically back to black
now flashing in the
centre of the monitor is an icon of a tiny key
beneath it a row of six dashes appears e
a cursor is flashing over the first dash
bean is totally absorbed
he loves these kinds of puzzles
with one finger he slowly types out letters on the keyboard he has to search for some of them
as he does so they appear over each dash in turn a message pops up access denied bean tries something else
the message again access denied
the room door suddenly opens
making bean jump
he cannot see the computer screen from the doorway
how goes it bean
ready for the governor
bean smiles and nods nervously
he knows hes probably up to something he shouldnt be
we need you downstairs in ten minutes and not a second more
oh and put this on
bernie throws bean a name badge with dr
bean on it
bean goes back to the code
he types in the first thing that comes into his head that damned message again access denied
then as though something is dawning on him he punches in up comes a message code accepted
close on beans face as light from the computer plays on it he reads it carefully and with interest
we cant quite read his expression but what he sees is a surprise and a puzzle
long meaningful pause as his eyes scan the screen
bernie enters david is looking at whistlers mother still puzzled
the staff and various dignitaries are lined looking out through the glass in anticipation
through the glass we see a couple of police motorcycle escorts pull up outside followed by a beautiful old classic rolls royce
the red carpet unrolls all the way to the rolls rear door
close on the bottom of the drivers door
it opens and out step a pair of legs wearing army boots and khaki trousers
the legs step sideways onto the carpet and approach us
camera pans up to show us that governor reynolds is dressed in his veterans uniform chest of medals and forage cap
he is a grand figure
in fact hes exactly the same grand figure mr bean caused epic problems to on the plane over
he gives his prized possession the car a little token polish with his sleeve before heading on
brutus and his side kick cop fall into step behind him
they are the police presence today
grierson and bernie greet reynolds at the entrance
grierson is wearing a striking brand new light blue silk suit
bernie is frowning not happy about that uniform
what a pleasure governor
hi grierson forgive the war paint
going on to my regiment s reunion after
not at all governor
reynolds takes in griersons suit
beaming why thank you sir
off the peg
crestfallen yes it is
may i introduce you to bern
he gestures to bernie but reynolds cuts in and hands bernie a set of car keys
to bernie go park the old jalopy will ya son
bernies smile melts away
as they enter the gallery bernie hopefully offers the car keys to brutus who rewards him with a dont be stupid smile and follows the governor
bean wearing dr bean name badge comes into the corridor by the front door thus just missing reynolds
bernie sees him and jumps on the chance to delegate
bean go park the governors car will you
bean assents happily
brutus spies bean over his shoulder and frowns its that mad english guy again
bean gets to the door and sees the governors car
grierson leads reynolds to the reception counter as bernie sneaks up to take his position again
elmer is in the background trying to look professional deferring to brutus
annie steps out from behind the counter curtsies and shakes reynolds hand
good day governor
you know youre a lot taller than you were half an hour ago
well thats great to hear at my age annie
thank you very much
governor reynolds does your wife like have to curtsy
or does she have a decent job
reynolds is doing just fine
he spots kevin and winks at him
kevin smiles back
bean has let himself into the car
its one of the happiest moments of his life as he inspects the gleaming panel and sits back in the gorgeous leather seat
he starts the car up and heads up into the circular car park
he sweeps dangerously round a few turns but just manages to keep the car in tact
finally he reaches the top floor where there is one quite small space left
bean is a good driver in a car that is unfortunately one foot wider than the one hes used to
he takes out the comb he always used to measure space with his mini and measures the space
seems large enough
he moves the car in
it isnt large enough
with a hideous scraping of metal against metal the rolls royce squeezes in between the two cars losing its wing mirror and door handle in the process
bean looks a tadge concerned
reynolds has moved on to elmer who salutes crisply
reynolds returns the salute with pride
nice set of medals there elmer
which beach they drop you on
couldnt tell you sir
i was so drugged up with the killing i didnt know where i was
well congratulations soldier
bean sitting in the wedged car
he tries the door but it wont open a centimetre
hes totally stuck
he looks up at a small window in the roof
if only he could get that open
he pushes various buttons which set of windscreen wipers squirters radios
he pushes the cigarette lighter
finally he pulls a lever and the bonnet pops up an inch
at which moment we see the lighter shoot out and on to the seat
bean is still looking round below the dashboard when he notices a little fire in the seat beside him
not good news
bean panics a bit turns and half climbs over into the back seat when he spies a drinks cabinet
he has a very good idea he finds a cut crystal decanter of brown liquid opens it and uses it to douse the fire
not a wise move with brandy
before the cut we see the whooosh
of a major fire in the front seat of the car
grierson leads reynolds towards the main gallery
he points up to the video screen they are passing which shows the two of them walking along as does every screen in the gallery
reynolds is impressed
he glances at david in passing
nice tie fella
david grins to himself
the front of the car isnt what it was
there has been a big fire
its out now three decanters lie empty
bean is not happy
finally he decides to go for brute strength
he turns the car on again puts it into reverse and puts his foot down on the accelerator
we see the car from above
and then whoooosh wham
it reverses at mph straight backwards smashing violently into and destroying the back of the car behind as it happens bernies car
reynolds stops to admire a small painting a twelfth century crucifixion of christ
ah one of my favourites
it expresses a universal agony that the established church so rarely acknowledges dont you think
no ones got feet like for crying out loud
have you got feet like that
dammed if i have
lets move it shall we
bernie spots a slightly concerned david
everything okay david
i was just wondering where my english house guest had got to
hes just parking the governors car
great keep him out of trouble
bean is inspecting the car
hes not too happy with it
he tries to get the bonnet down but it insists on staying up
he shrugs his shoulders and gets in to drive off again having to wind down the window and drive by leaning his head out
this means that as he heads for the exit he fails to see the system to stop people leaving without paying a foot high barrier that appears out of the
when he hits it the car stops dead
bean gets out leaving the car idling and goes to the booth where normally the attendant would be but everyone is in the gallery at the moment
inside he pushes a couple of buttons and hurrah gets the one that drops the barrier
less hurrah he has forgotten to put on the hand brake
as he moves back towards the car it glides slowly down the ramp on the outside of the building then accelerates and finally on a particularly sharp turn smashes through
the wall and flies off the building
we hear a crash but do not see where it lands
governor reynolds turns away from another picture
can we go and see mrs
my eyes are making my feet sore as my wife would say
the party follows david as he walks through the gallery towards the double doors to take the lift to the whistler room
an excited atmosphere
ladies and gentlemen most of you have seen whistlers mother before can i ask you just to step back
its part of his plan of caution he knows theres something wrong and wants as few people as possible to
see the painting close up
the crowd moves back
id like the governor to have as it were a private audience with his new friend
reynolds is flattered
david inserts the plastic card key opens the doors and sure enough there in all its glory is whistlers mother
reynolds is delighted
he stands back to inspect her
well hello maam
yes she certainly looks a million dollars to me or should i say ten million dollars
bravo what do you say to a final glass of though i say it myself rather expensive champagne
grins smugly people start to file out
reynolds grierson bernie and david stay behind
david spots bean arriving
he hands the car keys back to bernie with a slightly dazed smile
david eagerly takes his arm and brings him over
governor i dont believe youve met dr bean our expert from england
they turn to each other recognition from bean its the man from the plane
he does a very quick hand shake and tries to make a getaway before reynolds recognises him
ah hello sorry i
in fatal slow motion he trips over the cord that stops anyone getting too close to the great painting
he spins and falls in the direction of the painting
cut to the looks of horror on all the faces
cut to bean reaching out to keep himself standing
we think hes going to tear the painting
he simply catches hold of the bottom of the ornate frame
it snaps off
cut to a look of relief for an instant on all faces
cut to the truth as the frame breaks off there is the little white strip saying the grierson gallery home of whistlers mother cut to a look of horror on
cut to elmer looking like someone has just murdered his own mother
cut to brutus and side kick glowering at bean
governor reynolds storming through the gallery with bernie and grierson scampering after him
you were going to sell the state of california a poster for ten million dollars
who the hell do you think you are shorty
look governor just wait its may not be as bad as it looks david and bean stand alone in silence in front of the debris
bean is absolutely destitute
david stares at him
bean just lifts his hands
what will what can david say to him
finally david just puts his hands on his shoulder
nice try kiddo
bean cant quite believe hes forgiven
at which moment there is a knock on the door
annie enters holding kevins hand
theres a call for you
its your wife
why dont you ask her just to leave a date for the divorce
ill check my diary later
then he notices the worried expressions on annie and kevins faces
shes calling from the hospital
bean and david both take this in
david turns and runs towards the reception area
annie calls after him
shes on line three
kevin grabs beans hand and they both run after david
annie watches bean go and sighs
the party is in disarray
in the background david is on the phone at the reception counter with kevin and bean
brutus hovers he suspects bean wants to question him
ive known soldiers whove had their heads blown off who were more intelligent than you two
not only have you failed to protect your most valuable possession from theft but you didnt even know itd been stolen
id sooner buy heroin from the guy who sells drugs outside my grandsons school than anything from you guys
i am sorry you feel that way
and im sorry you look that way short ass
that suit stinks and you obviously dye your hair
grierson is seriously shocked and offended
now bring my car round the front please ive had enough of this crap
he rushes off
meanwhile david slams down the phone and he bean and kevin rush out of the building
elmer brutus and side kick give chase
davids car screeches out onto the street and tears away
brutus and side kick arrive flustered at their car
side kick is frantically searching for its keys
come on man
a car passes by them slowly
elmer is driving
he shouts from his window
hey cop wanna ride
jeese where do they get you guys
the cops jump in his car while it is still moving
reynolds at the entrance
bernie walks up sheepishly holding up car keys
there is one other tiny problem sir
davids car speeds by
elmers car is not far behind it
david is driving fast
is jenny gonna be okay
she was wearing a helmet
it could have been worse
but is she gonna be okay
snapping how the hell should i know
kevin is hurt
what can i say shes unconscious
and i mean every night when we sleep were all unconscious arent we
shell pull out of it
god though why the hell do kids have to ride bikes
david slams on the brakes
he nearly went through a red light
shes a good kid
sometimes good people get a break once in a while
manages a smile a chauffeur driven open top limo pulls up next to davids car
bean looks out of his window to see the bag lady from the mall robbery sitting in the back
she is still wearing her filthy clothes
she raises a glass of champagne to bean and smiles
bean waves back uncertainly
hes sure hes seen her before a vague memory
cut to elmers car is in the traffic queue about ten cars back
brutus and side kick get out and start running down the line towards davids car
the lights are green
david puts his foot down and the car screeches away just as brutus and side kick are within inches it
cut to brutus and side kick turn on their heels and head back to elmers car
they are very unfit
they are just about to jump in the car when gun shots are heard from a near by gas station brutus turns and sees a
robbery in progress
a man with a gun is about to run away
brutus is torn not knowing which quarry to pursue
ill tail em
you got it
brutus and side kick draw their guns and run towards the gas station
in a moment of confusion a shot rings out
we think in the corner of our eye that we see brutus fall to the ground as elmer screeches away after davids car
much hustle and bustle
david is getting directions from a nurse at the desk
he beckons to kevin and bean and strides purposely towards a corridor
they hurry to catch him up and bean treat on the back of his shoe
david turns and shouts at him
just stay away from me
he takes kevins hand and storms away round a corner
bean is taken aback not knowing what to do or where to go
he is really feeling sorrow now
all part of his slow coming to feel things properly
david and kevin turns a corner and stop frozen
there sitting alone on a bench outside jennifers room is alison
she gets to her feet
their eyes meet
a crowd outside the gallery look off camera
the camera follows bernies gaze and takes in the modern car sculpture
where there were two cars face down in the earth there are now three the new addition being governors pride and joy
the three cars form a tall pyramid
close on reynolds face
dont even think of saying one word to me or i find a way of fitting all three of those cars right up your ass
grierson nods hes got the message
alison and david are standing where they were before three paces apart
alison is upset tired and drawn
theyre not calling it a coma
the doctor says shes
just kind of taking time out
to kevin hi tough guy
to david its a busy night
the doctor will be back in a while
a doctor passes excuse me
ill be back in a minute
alison looks at him
we dont quite read the expression but somewhere under there we know shes thinking yup hes still ineffective
at least you didnt bring mr bean with you
bean is looking for his friends
a doctor sweeps by him
a nurse behind
we need you urgently in c theatre
i was just going to number
it is urgent sir
the doctor rushes away and drops his stethoscope as he
bean sees it picks it up and follows him hes trying to be useful
elmer is at the busy reception desk and has been talking with a nurse
no no i didnt realise the situation
i wont disturb them now
elmer is obviously moved to find out about jennifer
he moves towards the exit
he is surprised to see buck the night shift guard dressed in civvies sitting with outpatients
buck looks up painfully goes to say something then dashes into a mens room close by
elmer shakes his head and leaves
bean still following dr jacobson who goes through more swing doors and then suddenly disappears
bean sees a big above a door and goes in holding the stethoscope
a nurse accosts him instantly
she reads his name badge
bean is fed up trying to correct people with this misconception
yes yes yes
just in time sir
she immediately slips the white coat onto bean and the gloves and the mask
alison david and kevin are sitting on the bench opposite jennifers room
kevin picks up jennifers super nintendo console from the bench
david notices this
alison answers his look
when the police told me what had happened i
its stupid i know but i remembered all that stuff people do to get through to coma victims
like playing them recordings of their dish washers and coffee grinders
so i went home and picked it up
pause you still call it home
alison looks at him seriously
inside the operating theatre a body is waiting in position
there are attending nurses and an assistant doctor
they all look up to bean as he enters fully kitted up
good evening doctor
what we have here is a bullet wound in the lower thorax it seems to have ruptured the lung and theres severe inner bleeding along the abdomen
hes coming round
give him a t straight away
the victim starts to move he looks up we see his face for the first time
it is the police officer brutus
he is in great pain
as the sedative shot goes in bean takes off his mask and smiles with a little wave
a look of total panic goes over brutus eyes as he loses consciousness
shall i do the cut sir
bean nods hes not going to argue with anyone
the assistant cuts
bean is horrified almost faints then snatches the knife
he cant believe this maniac has just cut through another personas flesh
its only my first week
bean hands the knife to the nurse testily
im afraid well now have to wait for the x rays doctor or well never find the bullet
come on everyone sort out the support systems
everyone turns to get on with their particular jobs
bean is left with the body
he gets a little bored
takes a sweet packet out of his pocket
only one sweet left
he takes it out lovingly and then does what he always does throws it up into the air to catch it in his mouth
unfortunately he forgets that he is wearing a mask
it hits the middle of the mask and bounces into the cut in the body
bean looks down annoyed
checks round him everyones still busy
so he puts his hand in the body really rummages around finds the sweet takes it out and then realises hes in fact got the bullet between his fingers
guiltily he slips it back into the body rummages a bit more finds the sweet wipes it pops it in his mouth
at which second the x ray arrives
here we go doctor
studying the x ray the bullet is here so well probably have to extend the cut to here
think we all better be prepared for a long one here
this is tricky
bean tuts scornfully youre wrong reaches in again feels around for a second and triumphantly produces the bullet between his fingers
they all applaud
bean exits from the theatre still in gown and mask followed by the assistant
the police side kick is waiting
any news on the chief
there certainly is
dr bean here just saved his life
side kicks eyes water
bean shakes his hand nervously and heads on fast before hes found out
he turns the corner and suddenly sees david and alison still seated
alison sees him
sorry honey he just happened to tag along
nothing ever really changes does it david
she turns her head away the bond of the moments before is gone
bean looks very contrite
at that moment another doctor walks by
yes your doctor will be with you in a minute
we have a lot to deal with here sir
alison looks round and shakes her head
bean kicks david in the shins
david looks round puzzled
there is a poster of the human skeleton
bean points to the spine
david looks but cannot fathom a relevant meaning from it
another doctor comes along the same one who they spoke to first
hes young confident slightly arrogant
excuse me doctor
really maam well get to you in due course
david looks at the poster opposite again
spine ribcage skull
looks back at bean gesturing to it
this time the penny drops
say that again son
i beg your pardon
i said say that again son because the next time you do ill make sure youre in there with my daughter but in a slightly less healthy state and shes
in a coma with a broken arm right now
sorry if youve been waiting a long time
in fact weve been sitting here since the start of the millennium and id really like some action from you before the end of the world
a hint of a smile arrives on alisons lips
shes heard that somewhere before
so why not haul your
checks nice little ass into this room and explain to me and my wife why our precious daughter is going to be absolutely fine because of all the fantastic intelligence
and attention you are going to give her case
david turns to alison she does a little tilt of her head wow
and he turns to bean who points to himself and nods
n come on
yes and bean for gods sake keep out of the goddamn way will you
bean nods enthusiastically and backs off
smiling well well
close on an e
monitor green lines on black screen
david and alison sit by jennifers bed
jennifer is unconscious
she has her arm in a cast and a small band aid on her head
otherwise she seems undamaged
kevin is sitting on the end of the bed playing the super nintendo game the gothic vampire thing with bats and he men we saw on jennifers tv earlier
it is plugged into a t
which sits on a trolley
its quite a noisy game
kevin is immersed in it
lets get a coffee
kevin i send bean in to keep you company
he sees jennifer for the first time
sympathy shows in his eyes
help me with this
its a scientific experiment
were gonna wake up sleeping beauty here with the tortured screams of vampire bats
bean is determined to help
he sits down with kevin
the game continues
the he man jumps up and down lashing out at bats with his sword
lots of noise but jennifer sleeps on
by a drinks machine
alison finishes drinking from a plastic cup
she looks up at david whos looking at her
slowly she gets close and puts her arms around him
shes a bit tearful
everythings gonna be fine
pause about charles
it was nothing
he just makes me laugh
when was the last time we laughed
any of us
ive been an arsehole of spectacular proportions
they look down to see kevin has arrived
these guys just hijacked the t
me and bean were trying to
a hospital porter passes pushing the t
on a trolley
were short on these and theres another kid down the hall that could use
wait a minute
about to get tough again please
to david wow who put the fire in you my man
jennifer is still asleep
bean is sitting on the end of her bed
he looks at the super nintendo console thinking how can i get this working again
how can i help
the only sound in the room is the beeping from the e
machine monitoring jennifers heart
bean has an idea
he yanks off the jack plug at the end of the super nintendo lead
producing his small screwdriver he starts to unscrew the console casing
david alison and kevin walk back towards the room
maybe i ought to think about getting another job
good idea with a boss whos a really ugly son of a bitch
she and david manage to share a smile
theyre going to get through this
suddenly we hear noise from the vampire game coming from jennifers room
kevin registers this and is puzzled
then alison and david notice it
i thought you said
the learys appear in the open doorway
their expressions turn from curiosity to horror
bean has plugged the super nintendo games system into the back of jennifers e
a couple of bats are flapping about the screen but the most worrying thing here shown in close up is the sight of a he man type jumping up and
down lashing out with his sword at the passing pulse light showing jennifers faint vital signs
david slowly moves into the room
just put down that thing
nice and slow
you hear me
come on now
but bean is determined to keep going its his way of reviving jennifer
david approaches the opposite side of the bed and gets ready to pounce
cut to a close up of the monitor
the he man chases the pulse light
david dives across the bed just as he man swipes the pulse light with his sword
david has landed on top of jennifer
the pulse light explodes and the monitor screen whites out
jennifer wakes up with a start
whats happening here
alison covers her mouth tearful but she cant hold it back
david and kevin stare at jennifer
they cant help but join in the laughter
jennifer has no idea whats going on
bean is happy that everyone is happy
i dont care what anyone says
bean brought my sister back from the dead
he did it under laboratory conditions
my eyes do not lie
alison grins at him
then at bean
alison is fixing some coffee
here let me do that
no im fine
he just stands there
okay you grind the beans and he moves towards her his arms slip round her waist
put them in the
but she cant concentrate i dont believe this
im being seduced by my own husband
they are just about to kiss when bean enters
hes a bit impatient
ahm excuse me
pointing to his watch you know
they jump apart
the moment is gone
though i think these are ready
alison takes out two single socks which have been neatly wrapped around a couple of drinks mats and put in the toaster slots
is that how you like them
bean beams at her
hes impressed and feels hes accepted
hes not too bad
i can live with him
im afraid you dont know the half of it
i have a tale to tell
and not a happy one
looking in front outside we see alison sit down
we see but do not hear david start to talk
within seconds her hands go up to her face in horror
with heavy hearts everyone is gathered to hear their fate
pan across the familiar faces
bean looking nervous and shifty
dead silence as grierson stands very solemnly
colleagues what can i say
incidents such as occurred yesterday teach a man important lessons
on reflection i realise it would have been a sin to sell whistlers mother to such an impertinent philistine as governor reynolds
and therefore i blame myself for having ever let things get to such a pass that we felt we had realise our the staff twelve got today ive schimmel as
to sell her
i suddenly problem here hasnt been its been the leadership flabby lazy and so decided to appoint bernie my new vice president
cut to bernie looking smug next to david who is pretty shocked by this
hes a man with a plan who will haul us into profitability and the st century
thank you sir
although im afraid i dont quite see how we can
good point bernie precisely the kind of perceptive interjection id expect from my new v
how can we you ask survive without whistlers mother our single greatest asset
well the truth is we cant
so what am i saying
will we find her again
never this robber was clearly the work of a criminal of great genius
bean looks pleased but then realises its not a suitable emotion so nods sagely
not a chance
those bastards never pay
so surely were bankrupt
surely your jobs are forfeit
surely youre back on the unemployment lines scraping a living as waiters and boys
except for one little thing
one little thing done by one little man
dare i say one helluva little man
everyone is totally at a loss
grierson stands and moves to the framed poster of whistlers mother on the wall
he then produces a plastic key card and inserts it in a slot on the side of the frame
a buzz and a click
an electric motor starts to whirrrr
the glass along with the title strip at the bottom of the poster slides gently down inside the picture frame to reveal that the poster is in fact the original
oil of whistlers mother
ladies and gentlemen
the real whistlers mother
there are gasps from the room
bean is open mouthed
grierson beams as many applaud and bean now joins in hyperactively
the best security in the world is no match for a master criminal
but no master criminal is a match for me
thank you all
now if you would please return to your posts my new vice president bernard shimmel would like you all to see the computer program we had prepared for yesterday until
we were so rudely interrupted by events
the room is emptying
david and bean stand there david stunned
grierson heads over
david david david
because i let a
copy of a painting the get stolen
of course not
im sacking you for neglectful conduct relating to the heavy financial loss this gallery has incurred through your recent lack of professional judgement
a loss i trust bernie will be able to reverse
i will of course invite you an excellent reference or bernie will
bernie looks across from the computer and smiles
bean has his eyes on david
he is mortified by whats happening
grierson notices but misinterprets his worried expression
of course dr
bean well arrange alternative accommodation for you
i believe bernie has a spare room with en suite bathroom
david glares at bernie
bean is thinking no
i dont want to stay with horrible bernie
how are you making out there
all fixed up sir
stick around davey boy
this is going to be quite a show
he presses an intercom
hes enjoying himself
hi everyone this is your new vice president bernie shistler
would you please watch your video screens
youre in for a treat guys
all the staff in all the rooms gallery canteen corridors look up at various screens
cut round rooms during this flashy demonstration
here you can see our new interactive gallery guide
every picture in the gallery will have its own story to tell
a van gogh picture comes up on the giant video screens and then keeps changing as bernie keeps talking
just click and here is a portrait of the painter then his family then other paintings by him then other pictures relevant to him in the gallery everyone is delighted
and the beauty is any idiot can use it
dr bean would you like a try
bean swiftly obliges and sits at the computer
perhaps youd like to bring up whistlers mother
but bean has another plan
he begins to click boxes
the millais painting we have seen before with the padlock comes up on the video screen
ah our visiting professor has chosen the splendid millais painting his mistress bean busy on the computer
just click on the corner
bean again disobeys
he clicks on the padlock repeatedly humming the familiar goblins tune
bernie is looking very tense
right let me take over now
bean turns and snarls at him almost a bark
everyone is glued to the screens
youve had long enough on it now
a jokes a joke
on the computer screens the screen has gone black just as it did when bean was playing earlier and the dashes have appeared with the flashing cursor over the first
all watch intrigued by what they see
the blood drains from bernies face
still humming happily bean slowly types in the letters you can stop right there mr
those are confidential
words and figures fill the screen
bean throws his hands up and sings a verbal fanfare daaa
grierson moves to davids side and the two stare at the screen the meaning of its contents dawning on them
close up of the screen as their eyes find the words new artist exhibit in the middle of columns of words figures and dollar signs
the same figures are being flashed all over on the huge screens
people watching and listening in awe
annie and elmer stare at it angrily
excuse me if i may just
calmly shut up schimmel
exactly how long have you been siphoning gallery money into your own private accounts
david scrolls down the screen
look at all this publicity expenditure
all completely fictional
back as far as june
i dont think you really understand what youre looking at
youre dead grease ball
he pushes a button that sends a picture of whats happening in his office throughout the gallery
my friends good news
mr schimmel is not only no longer vice president
he actually no longer works here
but wait a minute you cant let some moron from england turn you against me
i deny any knowledge of this
he probably typed in all this stuff himself
dont you find it all a bit suspicious that its here at his fingertips
pointing at bean theres your criminal gentlemen
theres the limey that set me up
all eyes turn to bean
cut to people watching the big screens everywhere
have you got anything to say to that
bean looks long and hard at bernie
yes pause its exceedingly rude to point
and punches bernie sharply in the nose
everyone in the gallery bursts into applause
half an hour later
police cars draw up
bernie is shoved in the back seat of one
grierson bean david watch
to uniformed cop i dont know what your methods are these days officer but id also ask him a few questions about the destruction of the whistler copy
bean nods his head firmly
the car pulls away
then breaks and reverses
the side kick gets out
oh yeah i forgot
side kick opens the back of the car
he takes out a huge bunch of flowers
the chief said i was to give you these
bean is delighted
then sniffs the flowers
what a nasty stink
not his sort of thing at all
side kick drives away
grierson turns to david
i owe you a very serious apology young man
it wouldnt surprise me if you wanted to leave us after this
i sincerely hope that you do not
very accommodating well no sir im sure
he looks sideways to bean who is frantically pointing to his spine
david gets the message and changes his tune
let me think about that thomas
wed have to talk quite a salary hike
and a car
maybe two cars
a car sounds sensible
and i need fridays off to spend more time with my family
speaking of which if youll excuse me
ive got a lot of time to make up
david heads off
bean wants to follow but needs to get rid of the stinky flowers
he turns to annie and gives them to her to be rid of them
she beams with delight after all he did love her
bean heads off with david to the parking lot
as they go david puts an arm round bean
who shoos him away instantly
no sloppiness for him
the leary family in a group
jennifers arm in a sling
well its been
but thank you
she goes to kiss bean but he just sticks out his hand and shakes it firmly
then moves on to jennifer
good bye mr bean
sorry i screamed that first time
he shakes her broken arm firmly
and she screams again
come on hurry or well be late
bean kevin david get into the car
it pulls away as they drive off bean sticks his hand of the window and waves a last farewell to alison and jennifer
at last a sentimental moment romantic music swelling like liza minelli at the end of cabaret
until the waving hand viciously cracks against the wooden front gate as the car squeezes past
the three year old women dressed in curly red wigs from the musical annie hug and kiss their little bald man and send him off through the gates
they shriek and wave him good bye
david kevin and bean are there
oh and grierson phoned lord walton at the national
said good things about you
so expect a great reception back home huh
promotion is in his sights
he studies his watch
hes being polite but held really like to get going
good bye beanie
and dont forget youre welcome to come back anytime
david delivers a sharp nudge to his ribs
in the distant future
thanks for everything
and take care huh
i know its insane but im going to miss you
bean nods abruptly picks up his case checks his watch and goes
he doesnt look back
kevin and david turn and walk away
david does stop to look back over his shoulder at bean heading off in the distance
but bean doesnt turn so david walks on
then there is suddenly a tap on his shoulder
its bean as though hes magically jumped there
he gives david a big bear hug a big grin and then a little wave and heads away
in the distance he treads on the back of some ones shoe
shot from high up
beans lime green mini approaches coming around trafalgar square and drives up onto the pavement in front of the gallery
it stops and bean gets out
he looks up at the building pleased to be back
bean pauses outside the revolving doors to clip his staff identity badge onto his top pocket
he enters in high spirits
bean enters the reception hall
it is totally deserted
he frowns and heads on puzzled
the place is totally empty except for a cleaner sweeping up litter in the middle of the room
there are faded rectangles on the walls where all the paintings should be
only one very solid looking statue remains
bean is thoroughly perplexed theyve moved guy
bean is utterly perplexed
he looks round the corner into another empty gallery and shakes his head
bean looks up at the building and gives a disgusted grunt before getting into his car and drives off around trafalgar square
his brow is deeply furrowed
what will he do now with his life
the empty gallery bean just inspected
then from out behind the one remaining statue emerges miss hutchinson
then from behind a pillar lord is he gone
yes my lord
tell the others
very well my lord
a door opens and the light from the corridor falls on the gallery employees squashed into this one tiny room
its the gents loo
miss hutchinsons head pops in
massive cheer bowlers in the air massive music
behind the credits we see close ups of bean hammering away at large planks of wood on some wooden structure
he walks away from it without us seeing what it is and goes to his mini where teddy sits on a pile of books in the front seat wearing a
bean gets into the car which is laden with suitcases starts it up and drives
straight into the huge crate he has built
a rope tied to the back bumper pulls the lid closed behind him
the crate sits on the back of a speeding truck
