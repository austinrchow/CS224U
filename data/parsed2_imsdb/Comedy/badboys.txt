bunea vista st
burbank ca june the sun might be down but the city is baking
waves of heat ascend into the sky while an unmarked van navigates across the screen
the driver is eddie dominguez
and riding in the passen ger seat is a man dressed in black called fouchet
he looks to the rear
whats taking so long back there
where the rest of the gang waits
noah kuni ferguson and casper
all dressed in black like fouchet except for andy
he stands and shows off his miami pd uniform
his english is poor yet hes got a big happy to be along grin on his face
how do i look
like the real thing yeah
step back and lemme get a good look at you
through which eddie can watch the action
andy steps further to the rear almost to the door facing the front
tell me again about your assignment andrew
im the decoy
right you are
over the seat fouchet reveals a shotgun
andys body is blown through the rear doors as the van turns a corner
he dials on his cellular phone
fouchet sounds distressed
i just saw a policeman shot
im at the corner of
a stream of pd cars haul past lights blazing and sirens on full
crowds moving up and down ocean blvd
beautiful people walking
beautiful people watching
music blends from nightclub to nightclub
a police radio holstered to the hip of a street cop
it crackles with report of an officer down
be advised all units
corner of lennox and taylor
slipping by the street cop intro marcus burnett and mike lowrey
they shimmy through the hotel doors
where the buffed desk manager gets off the phone to greet the effeminate pair
im mike and im marcus
were lookin for a couple of our latin friends who checked in a little while ago
you might remember them
no chest hair
but our guest list is private
oh didnt they say
theres going to be party
its leans in close the b
stands for baby oil
maybe you can come
get off after you get off
all three of them laugh
well now that you mention it
they were kinda cute
lowrey and burnett clip on their shields and unholster their guns
the posing is over
this is business
on the table are two briefcases
one containing cocaine
the other cash
a pistol next to each
reveal the dealers
two young dominicans seated across from the tv getting high drinking beer and laughing out loud at the spanish language version of time traxx
the doors kicked in and lowreys first through
burnett on backup
on the floor
but the dealers split rolling out of their chairs
one goes left and the other right
lowrey tackles the first dealer to the floor
a latina girl screams
lowrey unfortunately looks and takes a hard fist across the ear from the dealer
angered lowrey swings his pistol up underneath the perps jaw and knocks him through the bathroom door
lowrey cuffs him to the sink
back to burnetts in trouble
hes still got his gun in hand
but the other dealer has him pinned underneath the legs of a chair
burnett stomps the bad guys instep
the guy buckles
burnett rolls away and stands in front of a window just in time to see the angry dominican heading straight for him
burnett and the other dealer come crashing out onto the balcony then over onto an awning rolling off onto some occupied cafe tables
uniformed cops move in to assist
appears soon after walking down the hotel steps leading the latina in his cuffs and wearing his jacket
scraped bruised pissed nice backup
we tilt up as police helicopter flies overhead
as opening titles run and music pounds we fly over the causeways waterways and hotels that line the beach
something is happening in the balmy city as we cruise downtown and zero in on
the helicopter roars low over the rooftops toward the causeway bridge
as the helicopter passes over he appears from behind a large exhaust port
casper ferguson and noah behind him all wearing high tech miners helmets with built in radio headsets and an array of high tech tools
the team crosses the roof to a huge air conditioning unit
they climb inside carrying a six foot long metal case and what looks like a black scuba tank
though its windy and cramped in here at least its cool
from a prone position fouchet puts on his night vision goggles and reveals a palm top computer
quickly he scrolls through the labyrinthine schematics loaded onto the unit
tilt down to see the various ducts
but clearly fouchets a man who knows his way
from squad rooms to locker rooms to booking
officer bill ofee s reads a magazine and drinks coffee
video monitors in front of him show the different lockers inside the evidence room
we see one room with stacks upon stacks of heroin
the team attached to cables slide into the buildings guts and disappear
static crackles were in
start the video
kuni finds the conduit hes looking for splices it cuts into it with a makita battery powered circular saw then attaches a handheld high video machine and starts the video
the unit is strapped to the conduit
the monitors flutter then stabilize
turning the page ofee sugars his coffee
an air vent smashes to the floor
two guys pull the metal case inside the room
another air conditioning vent grate crashes to the floor
their headlights blazing two men clamber into the cavernous room fouchet along with casper
this is the special drug holding room the lock cuts like butter and the steel door is yanked open
one hundred million dollars in heroin
each kilo brick is stamped with a distinctive octopus logo
into mic wheres deputy dog
over radio mic he made us
then do him now
as ofee stands from his desk where ferguson is waiting with an air powered tranquil izer gun
he cuts loose a silent round that strikes ofee at the base of the neck
but before he can think to reach back at what hit him his knees buckle and he drops to the linoleum
one by one he moves backwards through the various levels of locks torching each to look as if theyd entered the evidence room from inside the pd station
meanwhile noah removes what looks like a flattened bobsled with large urethane wheels from the metal case and places it inside the air shaft
ferguson attaches the black scuba tank labeled nitrous oxide to a valve
this is connected to a metal cased cable system that is piston gunned into the floor
fouchet and casper moving the stacks of heroin placing them in the air duct on the bobsled
once theyre done we hear radio garble then the sled is cabled to the con traption
a button is pushed and the sled is pulled at breakneck speed through the duct
bag after bag drops down the trash chute and tumbles into an open roofed van where the last of the gang eddie dominguez waits with the engine running
the sled rockets by again whoosh loaded with more bags
casper and fouchet throw the last of their gear down the chute and ride the sled out
they all land atop the bags
eddie guns the van which rolls up the ramp and out the garage
on the ledge the tape runs out and recorder explodes
the van drives off into the golden sunrise of miami
one of those expensive condo buildings on brickell avenue with a circular driveway and a uniformed doorman
camera tracks through expensive and trendy bachelors lair
state of the art everything gorgeous artwork
camera stalls on a perma plaqued newspaper clipping with a photo depiction of lowrey and burnett in front of a giant pile of black heroin thumbs up to the camera
the headline reads miami pd records record heroin bust
where lowrey wakes up in a king sized bed
the pain on his face and empty scattered bottles tell us hes nursing a world class hangover
he sits up carefully holds his aching head
hearing breathing lowrey lifts the sheet next to him
the one from the colony hotel
he drops the sheet back over her head reaches over to his nightstand and grabs an industrial sized bottle of excedrin
he opens the nightstand drawer extracts another bottle
bad boys rev
all marble and brass
lowrey opens up his medicine cabinet
locating a new bottle of aspirin
he suddenly realizes that the shower is running
confused he pulls open the shower curtain slightly
from the back its an incredible body then she turns around and its yes
the very same as the one he just saw in bed
lowrey closes the curtain on her
frowns at this impossibility
he steps back into the doorway and peers over at his bed
yep same face
shaking his head oh man
he tears open the bottle of aspirin
chug a lugs
burnett and his young wife theresa are jarred awake by the clock radio blaring on the night stand
theresa gropes for radio shuts it off
burnett playfully gropes for her
marcus what are you doing
were always saying we should spend more quality time together
well i got the time
and you got the quality
he kisses her
i can remember when we used to do it every morning
that was how we got a three bedroom house filled with little burnetts
she crawls from bed
been over a week since ive had some quality time
bad boys rev
theres the two and a half year old megan whos taking bites of food and spitting it back out looking at it then putting it back in
six year old jill who is playing refrigerator magnet games on the fridge
and marcus in the middle of it all deftly side stepping his eight year old boy quincy who appears on roller blades whizzing through with a hockey stick and ball
he body checks jill against the ice box
mom quincy pushed me
uncle mike showed me that move
quincy never you mind
and take those things off in the house
jill stop with the book and eat your breakfast
then exasperated marcus why do i always have to discipline the kids
you play bad cop for a second
alongside the kitchen screen door we see lowreys porsche roar to a stop in the driveway
kids knock it off
or your mommas gonna whoop your butts
theresa laughs in spite of herself as the kids continue to fight
into this craziness enters mike lowrey
ah family life
reminds me why i stay single
lowrey pecks theresa on the cheek
dont kiss me lowrey
i dont know where those lips were last night
bad boys rev
tell us some stories uncle mike
you know the one about the stewardess
dont go tellin my son about your sleazy sex life
i promise theresa
i only tell your husband about my sleazy sex life
the telephone rings
i dont want him knowing about it either
gives him ideas
answers the phone hello
which one of them do you want
lowrey accepts the phone from theresa and talks
youre live with lowrey
listens for a long beat scuse me captain
i think you mean to say get the fuck down here please
burnett automatically pulls on his jacket hugs the children as lowrey hangs up
not so fast
you were going to take the kids to school today remember hon
i have a job interview
lowrey rolls his eyes
burnetts following lowrey and the kids out his front door when his neighbor dick accosts him from across the hedge
bad boys rev
did you know we got busted into again last night
when are you gonna do something about this
how many times i gotta tell you
i dont work robbery
im in narcotics
meanwhile lowreys holding the car door open as the kids pile into the jump seat in the back
dont get your sticky fingers all over my windows
and keep your feet off the seats i just had the leather conditioned
the kids ignore him gleefully continuing to squirm around
before burnett can get into the car theresa runs out
i need you to stop at save more on the way home and pick up exactly whats on the list
she hands burnett a long list
lowrey shakes his head
lowrey and burnett pull up in porsche
lowrey and burnett walking
if im lyin im dyin
her sister came down and posted the girls bail
man talk about special effects
what special effects
bad boys rev
pm a a
tell you later mornin francine
wheres the smile
bad boys rev
francine a civilian employee of the narcotics unit
shes got pictures of her children parked around her computer desktop
and though dowdy would be a compliment shes usually got a pleasant smile for the boys
howards waiting for you
your kids are lookin sharp francine
burnett and lowrey know theres big problems when at the bottom of the stairwell the first thing they see is a yellow police tape and fingerprint team dusting a torched
problem is the building is nothing but cops and it looks as if the entire department is stomping all over the evidence room
theres sleepy grumpy sneezy happy bashful
now who could we be missin
could it be
both laugh hysterically while if it aint the leftovers from miami vice
fashion casualties lost somewhere in the eighties
and the women really go for that
really they do
as burnett and lowrey duck the tape they note a very groggy ofee over in the corner being attended by a paramedic team
hes still out cold
an oh shit look passes between the two partners
another torched lock noted as burnett and lowrey enter with sanchez an ruiz behind them
the room is emptied
captain howard appears
hes short has a military haircut and has a minor napoleon complex and a major in paranoia
nice of you to roll in
and nothing particular is going on around here except maybe your dope is gone
the biggest dope bust in the history of this department up and walked out of this locker along with maybe my job and the two of yours if we dont
get the shit back
this cant be happening
bad boys rev
so heres what were gonna do
since it was originally your case you two guys are on point
sanchez and ruiz you back them up with whatever they need
groans all around
so i guess we should start with the c
s and the perps from the original case
but hell if i know any dope dealers with the balls to pull this off
theyre either dead or in the lock up pending trial
oh hell be just fine
from the side appears a cigar chewing internal affairs suit named sinclair
he circles close to burnett and lowrey waving his cigar as he speaks
hes our new proctologist
you see whats got me confused is why risk leaving a witness
why not kill ofee instead
because maybe this guy knows if you kill a cop the whole departmentll get up his ass hard and fast
and who knows that better than anybody else
youre not sayin this was an inside job
cops wouldnt pull this shit
bad boys rev
not just cops
for example the s
youve got access
youve got wherewithall
and most importantly youve got the connections
who else would know how to unload a hundred million dollars worth of heroin
hey fuck you and your cheap off the rack suit
s in it and theres nothing we can do about it
if any of this leaks the shits gonna hit our biggest fan
he created us and you can bet your jobs boys hell rip us into little cop pieces
i figure we got seventy two hours to find the dope and keep our jobs
nothing like a little old fashioned incentive
he walks to the center of the room and kneels to those four bolt holes in the floor
he fingers the paraffin filler then looks above to the air conditioning grate
what about the air conditioning
so what about it
to lowrey what do you think
i think you should go ahead crawl up and give it a good look
bad boys rev
for one it was your idea
two while my suits fresh youre dressed for the occasion
dont say nothin about my clothes
i paid for these
and i dont
not on a cops salary
burnett crawls up with some help from lowrey below stalling the oscillating fan with his cuffs and crawling through
the first thing burnett notices are the track marks from the bobsled cutting through a coating of dust
i got some weird track marks in here
then burnett notes a manufacturing stamp at the joint
it reads orona air contitioning systems inc
who appears from below framed in the vent shaft
nice and cool up there burnett
maybe theres a new career for you in building maintenance
lowrey and burnett with their desks opposite each other
the camera circles while they lay the arm on some informants
theres gonna be a lotta cash when the dope hits the street
we want you to put the word out through your bank and hustle the account
you help us maybe we can see about getting those r
auditors off your ass
you and i both know youre the number one importer for the simona brothers
and im tellin you theres a buttload of h on the move and someones gonna wanna stick their dick in it
so it better not be yours
you hear something
you call us
you hear nada
you better get the fuck outta town
bad boys rev
lowreys driving no seatbelt doing his usual speed weaving
burnetts hanging onto the handle above the door
not a fucking lead
so now that weve done the obvious we need a shortcut
so we talk to max
not this time
im tired of you working pussy into everything we do
you got a better idea
lowrey and burnett arrive in the unmarked car
once colorful stucco fading and crumbling
scrappy cuban fighters spar and work out on the aging equipment while at the same time a remarkable amount of amazing looking women work out on weight bags shadow box
curves and sweat any way you look
and while lowrey cruises amongst the sweaty flesh as if it were a day in the park burnett lags
maybe he has been married too long
shes doing sit ups on an incline bench
she notices lowrey
you come to work out
anyplace we can go
bad boys rev
hows your wife
thats what i thought
this room isnt enclosed
its walled by wire mesh
private enough though
max shuts the door
sorry to come around only when i need something
forget about it
i owe you the rest of my life mike
lowrey just gives her an oh please look
dont be lookin at me like im getting all sentimental
hey i didnt open my mouth

burnett is surrounded by beautiful sweaty women
one of them is a fabulous black woman with legs so long and toned theyre not just legs theyre weapons
burnett cant help but stare
bad boys rev
whos maxs friend
i love cops
the other girls are suddenly interested too
burnett swallows and
im a cop
i shot somebody just last week

stone cold looks from them all
they walk away with burnett giving a what did i say look
you know that was really smooth
think you could do that again
as they start walking ohh
ill tell you when the wife gets meaner the grass gets greener
green aint the color i was thinkin of
more of a coco puff
just real shiny thick
as they head toward their car burnetts beeper sounds
he switches it off
the womans got fuckin radar on my ass
sensed me lookin at another woman
bet she wants me to pick up huggies stead of those baby garanimals that they wear
i dont think anybody could be that married
bad boys rev
burnett drives cautiously while both he and lowrey bob to ice ts cop killer
they get a kick out of the song
complies miamis the perfect town for you burnett
you drive like a one hundred seven year old lady with her turn signal on
and i plan on living to be old just like em
rubbin ben gay on my joints and everythin
an old guy passes them even though his car is pulling an airstream camper behind it
lowrey cant believe it
you gonna let every old motherfucker pass you
or just the ones with big ass trailers draggin behind
a c c el er ate
i dont have a death wish like you
i got a family that counts on me
a mortgage to pay
and im not sayin its me but most of the guys in the station think youre some rich kid playin cop
who said that
burnett mumbles an answer
if somebodys talking about me i wanna know
man im so sick of this
i dont apologize for nothing i do
i get up early and take it to the max every day
im always the first guy through the door
and the last guy to leave a crime scene
so fuck em all
i could give a shit what those boot lickin brown nosin ass kissin motherfuckers think of mike lowrey
what can burnett say to all that but
bad boys rev
i love you man
he lets loose a big grin
oh fuck you marcus
the radio crackles
over radio two one
i got that address for you on the air conditioning company
oh and theresa called she added something to your grocer list muppets toothpaste
bubble gum flavor
she says quincy doesnt like mint
lowrey rolls his eyes glances at burnett whos embarrassed
gimme the address
oronas been working out of his house
burnett and lowrey step from their unmarked car and start up the steps to this stony estate sized house
the air conditioning business has been good to orona
lowrey rings the bell
well we can leave a note or we can break and enter wait
i thought i heard orona beating his wife
bad boys rev
lowrey kicks the door in
did you cut one
musta been you
lowrey and burnett look at each other and draw guns
the door is unlocked and swings open easily to reveal lowrey and burnett in an instant repulsed reaction to oronas body which sits upright in his office chair the body
grotesque and bloated
a sickened burnett goes over to the body speaking to orona as if he were alive
where are the drugs
no answer where
shrugs he aint sayin nothin
he must be guilty of somethin
meanwhile lowreys got no problem with the dead body
he tries opening a desk drawer but oronas rigor mortis stiffened knee is in the way
so lowrey gives it a shove and the chair swivels
oronas dead arm sweeps the lamp off the desk
watch where youre swinging them dead arms orona
youre gonna fuck up your own crime scene
bad boys rev
lowrey braves the body and gingerly pokes around his pockets
watch what you touch
youve got the right to remain silent
anything you sayll surprise the shit out of us
finds small notepad jai alai
guy does the air conditioning contract for the p
hed have the plans
he trades the plans for his paper and gets popped by the perps
works for me
now can we go
im gonna puke
a palm beach styled antique
as antique as the exterior
lots of potted ferns amongst rattan and craftsman era furniture
enter matronly in her flowered dress and bare feet she carries a tea tray toward the kitchen
max is following
bad boys rev
make some calls
im looking for a party with fresh cash
im not doing any favors for mike lowrey
then call it a favor for me
ill make the calls
but you have to talk to julie
ill talk to her but shes not into it
all you have to say is that shell be getting paid for what she already does for free
bad boys rev
and shell say theres one big difference
i do it for fun
i dont ever have to blow anyone i dont like
it swings open to reveal julie mott just as beautiful as max and dressed to be undressed
she drops one of those big models shoulder bags to the floor and gazes curiously back at lois and max
her ears are burning
so whatd i miss
the hotel bustles with activity
cabs pull up
as max and julie walk through
bad moods after a bad round of golf
i had blonde hair then
what about ronny
you were a redhead
only for two days
it wasnt even a phase
bad boys rev
bad loser and bad bad blonde
farrah frosted kinda big bad blonde
but thats my point
i remember my hair phases more than i remember the men
playful sarcastic so a party in a biltmore hotel suite
yeah thatll really rock
its a favor for a friend
if it sucks after a half hour well split and head to south beach
you know my friend mike lowrey
rolls her eyes mike lowrey

well ive told you before my mike isnt like that
if i were in real trouble mike lowrey is the only person id call
bad boys rev
upon arrival the door is opened to max and julie by eddie dominguez instantly recognizeable from the heist
eddies pouring champagne into a glass
max my little carina
its been a long time
and whos your friend
julie sizes him up
come on julie
come in max
welcome to the al capone suite
thevre stepped into a grand opulent suite
high arched ceilings
magnificent antique furniture
no party guests
im not kidding
capone had the place fixed up with secret passages and hidden stairways
can you dig it
people were actually killed within these walls
hes moved behind them and reveals a concealed staircase that rises into darkness
stuck at the biltmore with a scarface wannabe
she looks over at max
lets get outta here
i need to use the bathroom
julie crosses to the bathroom
i thought you dropped off the edge of the earth and died
either that or you moved to california
bad boys rev
looks like were way too early
hows about we come back later
dont go yet
we can party
just us three
look at what eddies got to play with
from underneath the couch eddie reveals a single key of heroin
max tries to hide the recognition that she just hit paydirt on the very first try
where shes silently cursing max for getting her into this lame ass party when she hears muffled voices outside the bathroom
instinctively julie peers through the louvered shades
she sees eddie opening the door to fouchet
casper and noah follow him inside
eddie is instantly nervous in the presence of fouchet
whos the girl eddie
just a hooker my names max
outstretched hand im just a friend
i could use a friend who looks like you
lemme get a good look
max tries to size this man then chooses to submit
she does her best models turn
slowly giving him a view of the rear when fouchet draws a pistol bam bam
max tumbles forward and crashes through a glass table
julie saw max killed and retreats to the opposite side of the bathroom in total fright
now fouchet swings the gun onto eddie
youre a fucking idiot
now is that my dope
freaked our dope
that was the deal yeah
until we got the money bam
fouchet shoots eddie in the knee
fucker fucker fucker
i have four more days until i make the deal
when its done you get your money
now what part dont you understand
you need me
i dont need anybody
i got three little angels looking over my shoulder
fouchet unloads three more shots
bam bam bam
blood spatters onto casper
you got blood on my new suit
ever hear of dry cleaning
now shut the fuck up check for the rest of my dope
half panicked half trying to keep her head
theres no way out of the bathroom
all she can do is switch off the light
and now she sees caspers shadow as he approaches
as it turns
julie suddenly reaches for it and pulls open the door with a surge
casper stumbles in his face hitting the hard tile with a crunch
making her move she hauls as fast as she can across the room
aiming for that secret fireplace door
wheels with his pistol unloads the clip
bullets are catching up ripping up the couch and the rest of the suite
julie dives right into the secret door
we move with julie as she races through it heart in her throat
she comes upon some old metal stairs a sliver of light at the top and clambers up
high atop the biltmore this is where the passageway leads out to
a door flies open and julie appears
wind whipping all around her
a bird flies by startling her
hearing the approaching thugs julie sprints as best she can across the spanish tiled roof
turns to see noah and casper appear in the bell tower
noah scans the roof takes aim and fires but hes too far away and julie disappears behind a rise in the roof
she steps towards the edge of the roof
quickly peers over
a huge swimming pool five stories down
she weighs the options
jump or die
as they try running across the harsh tiled roof
my fuckin shoes
my fuckin italian shoes
then julie prays silently takes a running start and leaps from the roof
slow motion as julie flies through the air like some glamorous angel
as julie breaks the surface with a huge splash
the water swirls as her aching body struggles to the surface
julie breaks water like a dolphin gasping for breath
shes dazed and confused but alive for the moment
fouchet reaches down and picks up maxs purse then flicks it across the room to the defeated pair of casper and noah
shes a hooker
find out who she works for
find out where she lives
several police cars an ambulance and a coroners van are now parked in front the lobby awash in strobing red and blue lights
camera pans past the crime scene personnel to find burnett and lowrey pulling up to the scene
they get out and thread their way through the growing chaos
the place is a mess
homicide detectives are already on the scene drawing chalk circles around casings on the floor
on the far side of the commotion the two bodies have been photographed and are covered
chief howard is conferring with a technician whos dusting for prints
but sanchez and ruiz are already on the scene
you guys watch where youre walking or youll fuck up the crime scene
looks like youre already doing that
burnetts quick to point out the trail of bloody foot prints ruiz just tracked across the carpet
which julie left on the fireplace mantel
lowreys quick to note the two separate shades of lipstick
a hood registered as eddie dominguez and some jane doe
but the table over theres covered in high grade dope
i think we got us a witness
over here i got two different shades of lipstick on one champagne glass
meanwhile he drops the sheet on eddies body then moves over to maxs
he doesnt know its her until jesus no
burnett drops the sheet turns and puts a protective shoulder between lowrey and the body
who is it
lowrey instintively pushes past his partner and kneels at the body
he pulls back the sheet
right now he could kill the shooter then himself
in that order
lowreys eyes well up
i shoulda told you to be careful
the elevator doors open and out step burnett and lowrey into a lobby full of cops
lowrey goes straight to the front desk
i want his phone calls
he flashes a badge
you pay the bill you can see his phone calls
maybe i wasnt polite enough
with a flashing right jab lowrey pops the snooty clerk
after the clerk finds his feet eyes peering over the counter
i wouldnt fuck with him right now
walking down the steps toward their car lowrey passes the phone sheet off to burnett
three calls to lois fields
im going to stop by her place and tell her a bedtime story
you can catch a ride with howard
lowrey jumps in the car
alright you check out lois then check in replete with balcony and billowy curtains the old styled madame lois fields sits up on her bed covered in pillows and exotic
she thumbs an old leather bound looseleaf binder full of modeling photos and resumes
im sorry jimmy
but you cant have her
shelly only models and thats all
like i always say some girls do some girls dont and the rest you cant afford line cuts out hello
suddenly the power is cut
the front door breaks down
lowrey parks the porsche
the door is open and the deadbolt looks smashed with something heavy like a sledgehammer
lowrey pulls a radio with one hand and his pistol with the other
bad boys rev
into mic this is twenty one two
im gonna need back up at reach road
lowrey eases inside the darkness of the doorway
he checks the lights but the power is off
slipping the radio into his coat pocket he returns with a mini flashlight and begins to clear a path doorway by doorway then moving up a wide stairwell
howard is sitting at the edge of the desk while burnett is on the phone with theresa
did you check parole
how about f
theyre supposed to be compliant with our requests
and where the hells lowrey
hand over phone following this lois fields lead
i just paged him
whats it with this guy
its always girls girls girls
as theresa screams no theresa
no he wasnt talking about you
moving through the doors of the master suite where a light breeze blows through balcony of sheer curtains lowrey turns ever so slowly with his flashlight following a beat behind
the beam comes to rest on a bludgeoned body laying on the bed amongst huge pillows and exotic stuffed animals
the telephone cord is wrapped around her neck
lowreys closer inspection reveals bad boys rev
where an obvious page and photo have been ripped out
lowrey goes for the phone
picks it up with his handkerchief
no dial tone
so he drops the receiver and heads out of the room
but just as he reaches the doorway suddenly lowreys beeper sounds
reaches down to switch it off when from out of those billowing curtains noah
sledgehammer in hand he swings at lowrey who instinc tively blocks and ducks as the hammer misses and crushes the bannister railing
it gives under lowreys weight who reaches over and traps the sledgehammer only to find one of noahs hammy fists battering him behind the ear until the rail finally gives
lowrey falls and crashes onto a craftsman table covered in antique picture frames
it collapses underneath him
then laying next to him
it squawks loudly
over radio pulling up now twenty one two
give us your twenty in the residence
twenty one two
do you copy
twenty one two
the camera lifts to reveal that noah has vanished
howard cant believe his ears
is every cops wife such a pain in the
theresa i know it was my idea
i know i was the one who wanted a little quality time
its just that this cant wait
cant i just wake you up when i get home
bad boys rev
lowreys phone rings
but howards close so he picks it up

burnetts volvo turns onto the block
he pulls over on the opposite side of the street and parks his car blending in with others in the residential neighborhood
he gets out crosses to the lobby of her building
burnett knocks on the door
bad boys rev
he notices his gold wedding band hastily removes it
just as he drops it into his jacket pocket whos there
she stands on the other side of the door with a baseball bat cocked and ready to fly
how do i know its detective lowrey

hold it up to the peephole
burnett shows his shield
holds it up to the peephole
anybody can get one of those
annoyed hey lady

on the mike with mike
after a beat the door swings ajar
but as burnett enters the house all he notices are that two dogs start yapping hysterically
he cant see her
but she can see him
from behind the door she comes out swinging a bat
burnett ducks and julie smashes the hat stand instead
bad boys rev
what the fuck was that for

you never even met him
the way max described you was different
she doesnt believe him and swings the bat
im way undercover
i knew her from way back
from time to time you know

julie swings for real nearly taking burnetts head off
so i exaggerated
its a man thing
she swings again but hes had enough he moves quickly catching the bat with his hand and ripping it away from her
you know what
you dont wanna believe me
thats fine with me
go it alone
burnett heads toward the open door
julies veneer drops as she shrinks to the floor
bad boys rev
i saw it all
i watched him shoot her
like she was nothing
trying to hold it together please shut the door
you dont got any more golf clubs or bats do you
nothin that you can swing at me do you
she shakes her head
he carefully steps forward
then lemme introduce myself
im mike lowrey
and im here to help you
youre not what i expected
yeah well neither are you
you swing like barry bonds
burnett nods and crosses over to help julie to her feet
look here i need to know if youve called anybody
or if you told anybody else where you are

julie nods scoops up one of her dogs and grabbing another modeling bag off the table
where are we going
as she stuffs the dog into the tote duke
bad boys rev
pulls away whoa
ill only deal with you
otherwise ill take my chances
burnetts getting a not again look on his face when a shotgun blast blows the front door open
clutching the bag julie races around the living room
wheres my other dog
fuck the dog
burnett sees the second dog cowering in the corner
so he lunges over scoops the dog up
as the remaining parts are kicked in from the outside
its casper noah and kuni
racing through the apartment toward the back door burnett wheels with the gun and fires just as kuni rounds a corner with the shotgun
the room erupts with plaster spray and noise
julie shrieks and burnett shoves her through the back door then spins and fires
kuni tumbles and dies from multiple hits
julie leads him down a metal stairway
bullets ricochet left and right
bad boys rev
follow burnett and julie as they race through the grungy alley to his station wagon the cafe is between julies front door and the volvo
casper appears firing his gun
people scatter and scream
bullets rip all about
burnett starts the engine and lurches out into the street
the plates on burnetts volvo
one dog starts to bark
fine time to bark
where were you when they were comin up the walk
bet they got a look at my license plates
if you saw him again would you remember the guy who shot max
all i remember is one of them had really bad hair
where are we going
i told you im putting you into protective custody
cuts him off no way
listen no offense but i dont trust anybody
bad boys rev
believe me its not a new thing
especially when my life is at stake
i read the newspaper you know people disappear all the time
exasperated again fine

i didnt really think about it
i guess its your place or a plane ticket
your place is cheaper
so you choose
my place is wrong
i mean right
as in good
my place is good
well go there first
confirms my place
burnetts volvo pulls into the circular driveway of oceanview terrace
burnett walks over to chet the doorman a shifty little guy whos always got his hand out
hes sitting on a folding chair reading penthouse forum
lowrey is out
he told me i could use the place tonight
didnt mention it to me
chet holds out his hand
burnett slips him ten
chet sneaks a peek over at the car sees julie putting on lipstick
hows that mrs
burnett realizes this is going to cost him more
gives him another ten
but for chet its still not enough
your children good
lowrey says you got a regular baby factory goin over there
all his money here
and if thats not enough im gonna run you in for extortion
now that i think about it mr
lowrey did mention something about giving you the key
the door opens burnett gropes awkwardly in the dark for the light switch
finally finds it
i forgot i had those switches moved
welcome to casa del lowrey
julie enters looking left and right cautious but impressed by the stylish digs
all this on a cops salary
what was your last pick
a horse in the number two race at pimlico
or did a bookie give you an inside tip
which julie runs her hands across labels
my father invests
you must be tired ill ask you this only once mike
are you on the take
and if you say no and i discover youre lying to me ill walk
are we clear
im not on the take
why dont you make yourself at home

instead of tv the room immediately becomes a seduction den lights dim romantic music

julie steps forward and wraps her arms around burnett
its a one way hug
uncomfortable burnett doesnt reciprocate other than a palsy pat on the back
dont mention it
burnett tries to break toward the door when the phone rings
burnett stares at the phone not knowing what to do
arent you going to hi
youre live with lowrey
leave it at the beep
the phone beeps
i know i told you i dont date cops
and i know i told you i wouldnt sleep with a man i wasnt going to marry
but ive been thinking and i remember when you said thinking was a dangerous thing so i started feeling
remember when you gave me that key burnett charges over and shuts off the machine
you dont have to explain
finally theyve reached consensus
burnett grins and is out the door
lock the door
dont open it for anybody
bad boys rev
as burnett is racing back through to the car he sees chet behind the desk and stops
shes a witness
im gonna be gone for about an hour

i could watch the door if you like
in a chair

heads for the door
yeah i was gonna be a cop you know

as doris storms toward her bedroom burnett trails her apologetically dont you honey baby me i swear baby its nothing
i was on the job as she gets to the bedroom doris wheels around and you just happened to lose your wedding ring on the job
he looks down at his ringless finger no
i got it right here
bad boys rev
he hastily fishes into his jacket pocket but too late doris slams the door in his face locks it
off burnetts pained expression burnett and lowrey on the move
if you were a real partner instead of some no backup hot doggin car chasin skirt sniffin motherfucker i would be gettin down to business with my wife instead of
stuck in this situation
thanks for the get well card
howard is in sweats awkwardly shooting free throws as his morning workout
parked on either side of the hoop lowrey and burnett patiently retrieve each missed ball and send it back to him
i tried to set the girl up with a sketch artist but she wont
i tried to get her to come in and look at the mug books and she wont come in
shell only deal with mike lowrey
he tosses a brick
so let her deal with the real mike lowrey
who i might add shoulda been there to take the call instead of runnin off like a hot dog without any backup
howard fires another missed shot
hes so bad its all burnett and lowrey can do to keep from spiking the ball
im not the one who left a strange hooker alone in my apartment
you know shes probably on the street sellin all my shit as we speak
i had to stash her somewhere

and youre on special assignment
im not living in that zoo
my house aint no zoo
bad boys rev
youre him hes you
until she makes the shooters and we get the dope back i dont care what you have to do just make it work
lowrey and burnett feel hammered by howard
upon retrieving his final brick lowrey passes to burnett who feeds back lowrey with a heel kick to the rim
and lowrey slams the ball home
they exit with howard simply staring
burnetts tossing some things into an overnight bag
theresa watches him concerned
you never had to go to cleveland on police business before
clevelands where they collared the dealer
and thats where i gotta go to testify
but what about us
the neighborhoods had all break ins
i wont feel safe if youre honey

why dont they send him to cleveland
its a federal subpoena
im the witness
im the one who has to testify

lowreys staying here
bad boys rev
theresa stands at the door with arms crossed
meanwhile burnett throws his bag in the trunk of the porsche
he and lowrey trade car keys the porsche for the volvo
dont forget to put snail guard on my lawn
just leave cleveland the way you found it
burnett climbs in waves out the window
bye bye theresa
be good kids
lowrey joins theresa on the porch
mockingly he puts his arm around her and waves
whys he taking your car
seething hes dropping it off at the mechanic on the way to the airport
the engine needs an overhaul
or will by the time he gets there
the porsche heads down the block with a grinding of gears
lowrey winces and heads for the volvo when theresa gets in his way
where you think youre going
i got a list here of things that marcus was supposed that marcus was supposed to do
cuz mikes a cop on a case with no time to waste
lowreys in the volvo and pulling away as fast as he can

one of miamis famous canals derelict ships are docked and rusting
one such ship an old freighter called the mariana
camera follows noah through a maze of tight corners and stairwells into a single massive hold converted into a drug processing lab
huge bakery sized mixing bowls chug on one side of the room while lab workers form the doughy cut heroin into pizza sized forms and shovel them into tractor ovens
on the other side of the room
when the pies come out more lab assistants re form the pies into keys
hes dealing with his year old chemist named elliot
explain it to me elliot
why are we behind
the cutting agent is highly volatile
you cant cook it like you would a pizza
i had to gear the ovens down to half speed
we already accounted for that elliot
its in our fucking timetable
so what else
elliot is uncomfortable
he looks back at wally his stoned looking assistant before forging ahead
theres too much moisture down here
the pies are taking longer to cook than we originally planned
its totally fucked
back to elliot now listen you little pussy
were not making pizza
bad boys rev
were making money
i gave you a deadline
if you succeed youre a millionaire
if you fail youre a fuckin corpse
and so help me god elliot
if you give me a fuckin ulcer ill dig up your dead mother and fuck her with your severed dick do you understand
christ calls out noah
bring me something for my stomach
a fuckin snapple or somethin
burnett enters and instantly those dogs of hers are shut up before i step on you
he drops his bags and heads into bedroom where
julies fresh from a shower towel about her and drying her hair
that you mike
at least your timings good
can you bring me the lotion on the nightstand
julie has a towel wrapped around her body
bad boys rev
so i was thinking
julie obviously free with her body suddenly drops the towel and starts applying lotion
burnett averts his eyes turning around a full one eighty but finds himself facing a mirror
looks left another shiny surface
to himself crazy fuckin woman
he steps from the bathroom and stands outside the door
the guy who killed max
now he was looking for the heroin that eddie stole from him
max went to the party as a favor to you
youre a dope cop right
special narcotics division
so this isnt about maxs death at all
its about dope
we find the dope we find our shooter too
theres some powder in there too
can you hand that to me
waits for an answer mike
burnett has disappeared into
burnett is going through lowreys extensive and meticu lously coordinated wardrobe shaking his way all the way through
bad boys rev
man when this is over im gonna get me somethin better than quality time
its gonna be men theresa on a boat mike
i borrowed a t shirt and some boxer shorts until we can somehow get back over to my place to pick up some clothes
burnett exits the closet to find julie brushing out her wet hair wearing nothing but what she described a t shirt and pair of lowreys boxers tied up with a
this ensemble never looked so good
we got mug shots to look at
scuse me i gotta hook into the p
he heads out of the bedroom
whos the guy in all the pictures
and there behind julie is a wall full of photos that hes never ever noticed
nearly all of lowrey
well thats marcus burnett my partner
burnett gets closer and must look around until he finds the singular photo of the two of them
its in a shitty frame too
theres the two of us see
gestures to photos my partner
ive known a lotta guys
and ive seen a good number of their bedrooms okay
but ive never seen
i mean look at it
its like a shrine to him
bad boys rev
sure i can see how it looks that way
but you see
a cop thing
then it comes thats because ive put a picture up there for every time marcus has saved my life
saved your life
i save his life
he saves mine
hes got the same thing in his house
pictures of me
good family man that marcus
okay but mike
this is like a lot of pictures
i mean this isnt something by the bedstand
this is a whole wall
and i know max said you were just friends
thats why i was thinking maybe
you could be
burnett reacts then recovers with
are you outta your mind
i didnt mean to offend you
its a good thing that im secure in my manhood to see that you dont mean that
you know how many women ive had in that waterbed
check the waves as they go by
turns back to living room now mug shots
burnett and julie are sitting at the computer looking at mug shots dialed in from the police database
she fiddles with but does not eat her salad while stealing sideways glances from the computer screen to the nasty bologna sandwich burnett is eating
the shooter said four days until he makes the deal
what else did he say
sounded like three angels
he wasnt worried because he had three little angels on his shoulders tellin him something
i didnt get the rest
back to the mug shots im getting tired of looking at ugly people
just a few more and we can take another break
i dont wanna take a break
then wed have to talk and i got nothing to say to a cannibal
that was a living breathing consciousness
it felt joy
maybe it even had a name
what had a name
that flesh youre shoveling into your mouth
stops chewing its just bologna
it was alive
some farmer fed it
got it to trust him
then blew its brains out dumped it in a cement mixer with a ton of carcinogens and now youre eating it
burnett never looked at it that way
he starts to put it down
at least finish it so i wont have to look at it
back to the screen lets look at some more ugly people
its a photo of noah along with his extensive rap sheet
thats one of em
lowrey is on the phone
captain howard please
uncle mike lowrey looks down to find little megan pulling at his leg

bad boys rev

burnett is cleaning up dog shit from one of lowreys persian rugs
the stain wont come out
so burnett tries a can that hes grabbed
julie appears with a pile of clean laundry in hand
your dog took a shit
and you used pledge to clean it up
looks at can lemon pledge
well that makes a big difference
you just varnished that into the fabric
im sure it works great
burnett doesnt quite know what to do with the wad of dog poop in paper towels still in his hand
julie snatches it from him and heads for the bathroom
he suddenly realizes that the clean clothes are his
bad boys rev
you cleaned my clothes
i just threw them in with mine
you cleaned my clothes
hes all appreciative until he notices something dis turbing
a shirt of his has a large bleached area on it
shyly i had a little accident
this is my favorite shirt
my lucky shirt
as burnett starts to walk away
i dont have any of my clothes
i wanna go back to my place to get some
not going to happen
i need apparel
that and i need some food thats something more than a cold slab of fear
slab of fear
all you got in the place are frozen steaks
i left my wallet at the office so ill give you some cash tomorrow
bad boys rev
quincy and jill are rapt as lowrey does a quick security sweep checking closets and window locks as he tells a bedtime story
so your daddy and i are trapped in this crack house in little havana
these dudes were real mean mothers
and they start coming at us with knives
now im scared thinkin im out for the count when in comes your daddy like a miami hurricane standing in the doorway
hands on her hips
oh hi theresa

but we want to hear the rest of the story
theresa silences quincy with a look
sensing his cue lowrey kisses the kids
gnight uncle mike
bad boys rev
lowrey is seated on the couch loading clips and dressing his weapon on the coffee table
as he pours a coke theresa appears at the bottom of the stairwell
if you were my husband id poison that
if you were my wife id drink it
twelve years im married michael
and i never let marcus bring his work home
just a harmless bedtime story
thought the kids deserved to know about the hero they have for a dad
we dont need any violence in this household and we certainly dont need any more heroes
what we need is a father and a husband
hes your personal errand boy
you beep the poor s
every hour on the goddamn hour
and why is it always about some useless bullshit that can wait until later
i mean the guys gotta job to do
you wanna know why i page him
because until that phone rings i dont know whether hes dead or alive
and lemme tell you
those three minutes im waiting for him to call back
those are the hardest three minutes for a cops wife
toasts with the coke touche theresa
bad boys rev
sheets and pillows are in the hope chest
ill see you in the morning
noahs car is parked down the block
with night vision goggles they glass the house
the camera starts on a beautiful shot of julie sleeping in the bedroom then pulls back and swivels to reveal burnett on the couch
gun laid across his chest
he lays awake while luke and duke sniff at his feet
lowrey unhappily pulls into the parking lot driving burnetts dilapidated volvo
ruiz and sanchez walking from the cars spot him and laugh as he climbs out of the wreck
ooh mean machine lowrey
you should recognize trunk
its the one you came to america in
you dont come from cuba by car asshole
lowrey walks by his own cherished porsche on the way in
lowrey and burnett on a roll

lowreys beeper sounds
he checks out the number

lowrey finds the nearest phone and dials
burnett is thinking theresa

lowrey glances over at burnett whos clearly loving the fact that its lowreys turn at errand boy
bad boys rev
hectic down here

lowrey turns to block the phone depressing the switch but acting as if hes still on with theresa
say why dont you rent a movie or somethin

gimme that phone
grabs it hello theresa

a lowrey is annoyed
he holds the list theresa just gave him as they walk down the aisle
marcus this is crazy
we are five minutes away from picking up this asshole and returning to our lives
and were here doin this shit
where the fuck is it
dont ask me to find it for you
youre the expert on my wife
bad boys rev
you know this is like some really bizarre shit that youre on right now
your wife asked me to do this and im doin it
besides im you remember
you dont even know where youre going
youre in the wrong aisle
lowrey follows burnett to the next aisle where burnett gestures to the wall of feminine hygiene products
you think you know what theresa needs man but i do this every month
challenges just look for fresh days
lowrey moves ahead
theres too much to look at
listen i read the parole jacket on this guy noah
hes a violent offender somethin like nine times
not a single drug bust on his sheet
hes a new recruit
keep looking will ya
you know it is a damn shame she makes you buy this stuff
hey this what husbands do
terrible fuckin job
examining shelves its like shaving cream
theyre all the same
grabs a box super wide
what the fuck
were takin this one
bad boys rev
burnett snatches lowreys box and puts it back on the shelf
hey man look
youre not even reading
these are panty liners okay
a woman chooses this moment to walk by
thats a whole nother category of thing
man for a guy that spends all his time chasing pussy you sure dont know much about the woo woo
beat here it is
you pay for it
burnett and lowrey park and pop the trunk
inside are guns and uniforms
what are we gonna be today
postal inspectors or water and power
water and power
approaching are burnett and lowrey but now theyre dressed in shorts and t shirts with bright orange vests and caps reading water and power
and as lowrey knocks on the door
wrapped around a pink refrigerator
what do you think the chains for
maybe some kind of hurricane anchor
they knock again
the chain jerks slightly
well the anchor just moved
both turn and look
and the chain is moving
at first it simply sways back and forth then it pulls taut and the fridge jolts
a deep guttural noise sounds
from around the corner a shadow grows large
lowrey and burnett instinctively withdraw their guns and aim just as a lion rounds the corner teeth bared claws tearing at the deck
the door swings open
burnett pushes lowrey inside just as the big cat lunges
lowrey and burnett are holding the door against the bad boys rev
who are you
lowrey and burnett heave then turn
theyre equally shocked to find a huge three hundred pound woman in nothing but her underwear
aaaaaaaaaaa animal control
but your uniforms say water and power
now were lookin for the owner of that animal
the cat dont belong to me
it belong to my brother
and i dont know where he is
thats too bad
because his lions tied to your trailer
so you gotta move the beast
or move the trailer
move the trailer
move it to where
only part of south florida thats zoned for wild kingdom shit
course the crocks down therell probably eat your brothers cat
but he loves that lion
raised him from a little kitty
well little kittys gonna be gator bait less you suddenly remember where your brother is
by the look on her face her memory is coming back
bad boys rev
lowrey and burnett pull up in the unmarked police car
chet is there to help with the door
to each of them morning mr
burnett grabs lowrey and yanks him toward the elevators
keys in the door and burnett and lowrey enter the apartment
julies dogs run up to them yapping
its me julie
julie enters from the bedroom dressed in something hot with the tag still hanging from a sleeve
ill be ready in just a minute
i thought id have you tell she stalls at the sight of lowrey a little spark of interest passes between them
you must be marcus
hand outstretched i recognize you from all the photographs
nice to meet you
turns around for burnett what do you think
he said we were going to a club tonight
we were going to a club
as in me and my partner
bad boys rev
oh thats fuckin swell

and all i got to protect me is chet the doorman whats that on the rug
it was my babies luke and duke
they get nervous in new surroundings
i offered to pay for the cleaning but mike wouldnt hear of it lowrey spots rings from glasses on the table
and have you ever heard of a new invention called the coaster
as he tries buffing the table with his sleeve
she might be catching on here
marcus you act like its your place
its not my place
shes a designer
she decorated the whole place at a discount just for mike
and when she hears about how hes been taking care of glares witheringly at dogs off the couch
lowrey chases the dogs into the bedroom
one of the dogs runs out with a cole hahn loafer in his mouth
they both follow him into the bedroom
bad boys rev
where the lock on the front door turns
the door opens
a mysterious woman in an overcoat sunglasses and spiked heels enters
the woman strips off the overcoat under which shes breathtakingly naked save for a garter belt and stockings
she drapes the coat over the nearest chair
im feeling really nasty right now
burnett is first to appear from the bedroom and his expression goes off the charts
startled the woman shrugs back into her coat
who the hell are you
burnett charges her instantly ushering her to the door
how did you get in here
julie and lowrey return from the bedroom
i have a key
whispers maybe you should call first next time
whats your name
you dont quit stalking me yvette im gonna place your ass under arrest
burnett slams the door
shes screaming on the other side pounding the door with her fists and cursing in mad spanish
finally she stomps off down the hall
the hells going on out here
bad boys rev
just that crazy yvette stalking me again
lowrey could kill
you didnt just send away yvette
that womans into some weird shit
julies confused to say the least
to burnett so mike

we as in marcus and i are going to club hell
were gonna nail this noah guy and get him to give up maxs shooter
anyone got a problem with that
i feel safer now
she turns and exits back into the bedroom
burnetts about to follow when lowrey swings him outside the door way and gets into his face
you are ruining my life
yeah well this case is messin with mine too
the ultimate miami night scene
a long line of local and hip and cool couples are waiting
lowrey and burnett appear at the front of the line coolly flashing their badges to a hipster couple
bad boys rev
got some bad news
your car got busted into
theres some uniformed boys in the parking lot wanting to ask you some questions
pissed and panicked the hipster pair head for the parking lot while lowery and burnett take their place near the front of the line
bad boys rev
julie still dressed for the evening paces back and forth
frustrated she rips the tag from her dress and sits back down at the computer
she plays with the keyboard and noahs mug shot pops back into view
she stares at it a little too intently
images flash in front of her the sights and sounds of maxs death replaying itself in her mind
snapping out of it determined she gathers her bag and exits
burnett and lowrey on cruise control this club massed with people
high above the room fouchet looks out upon the dance floor with both noah casper and ferguson behind him
my three little angels told me id get a visit from the cops tonight and there they are
turns and orders when they split up well drop the tall one and get the other one to lead us to the girl
lowrey and burnett move to the bar
theres a huge fishtank behind it
i say we split the room in half
make our own moves
hook back up at the bar in twenty minutes
sounds good to me
lowrey moves off and burnett turns to the female gin and tonic
smiling with lowreys platinum card and add twenty for yourself
bad boys rev
julie pulls up in lowreys porsche
before the valet can get to the door shes opening lowreys glove box
in it theres a pistol
julie mulls it over before removing it and stuffing it in her purse
lowrey meets burnett back at the bar
bartender says he works here
but she hasnt seen him all night
finishing his drink i gotta make a pitstop
and believe it or not the other side of the fishtank behind the bar
burnetts at the urinal blissfully relieving himself when casper appears at his side
theres that awkward men dont talk at the urinal moment until burnett leans over
musta drank about a million budweisers tonight waitin for my ol friend noah to show
wouldnt know him would ya
guy practically raised me up from nothin
never heard of him
burnett shrugs zips and reaches to flush when bad boys rev
which casper wraps around burnetts head
tell me where the girl is
casper slams burnett into the mirror
burnett struggles reaching for anything he comes up with the towel dis penser rips it from the wall and starts pounding over caspers head
lowrey sips on a beer totally unaware of whats happening on the other side of the fishtank
burnett rips the bag off his head reaches for his gun
but caspers there lunging into him and lifting him up and into the fishtank
hes been watching the fish in the tank but turns back toward the bar just at the moment of burnetts impact
the tank cracks on the bathroom side and water begins draining unbeknownst to lowrey
burnetts gun lays amongst the flapping carp and sea weed on the floor
both burnett and casper go sliding across the wet floor and into a stall both reaching for the gun
burnetts there a second too late
caspers got the gun
he swings it onto burnett and squeezes the trigger
but nothing happens
burnett in turn grabs caspers ears and hammers the big guys head into the toilet until he falls unconscious
burnett picks up his gun
bad boys rev
next time learn how to work the safety with your punk ass
as he cuffs casper to toilet now wheres my no good no back up partner
through the busted fishtank burnett catches sight of lowrey standing at the bar and making conversation with one of the club beauties
ferguson and noah split wide and start their move on lowrey
he sees julie charging across the dance floor
shes heading right for him
hes watching ferguson and noah moving in for the kill when fouchets pov shifts from the dance floor to julie
as he recognizes julie
theres an instant oh fuck look on his face as he realizes that the rules have changed
lowrey meets julie halfway
hes got her by the arm and is shouting over the loud music
what the hell are you doing here
the guy who killed max
i remember something he said
bad boys rev
starts moving her toward exit well whatever he said you remember to tell me later
each moving through the crowd toward lowrey and julie
guns with silencers held tight to their sides
three little angels
the guy who killed max said three little julie sees noah and freezes
the musics too loud
what you say about angels
noah closes the gap
through the crowd he draws down on lowrey
he pounds on the window
forget the cop
kill the girl
julie pulls the gun from her purse shuts her eyes and starts firing wildly
the gun bucks and each shot goes wildly high
noah dives for the floor
he hits the deck as the window is shattered by a random bullet
bad boys rev
the room clears around julie
noah is back on his feet once again with the gun
launches himself off a nearby table soars over the frightened crowd and comes crashing down upon noah
both lowrey and noah tumble to the floor
noahs gun skitters into the crowd
noah chases for it but cant find it
but got a clear shot at julie
he raises his gun only to find burnetts pistol at his ear
dont even think about it
as she grabs lowrey
meanwhile noahs on his feet and hauling ass out of the club
burnett sees that noahs on the run
so he cold cocks ferguson with the butt of his pistol and joins the chase
bad boys rev
appear at the door charging down the steps toward the valet and commandering a taurus that just pulled up
all three dive in
burnett behind the wheel
burnett hits the gas the car screams around in a tight circle just as slam
noahs sedan backs wildly across the road and crunches them
noah throws a shotgun over the back seat of his car and fires through the rear window
safety glass flies before noah shifts gears and drives on
noahs already up to mph races through a yellow light hangs a left
as the light turns red youre gonna drive through that arent you
burnett does hauling through the light
meanwhile lowrey has the bubble light in hand reaches out the window to stick it on the roof but it simply slides off
he reels it back in the car and hands it off to julie
noah is waving a shotgun out the back fires rocks as one headlight explodes cmon lemme drive do i backseat drive when youre tailing a hitman
bad boys rev
both speeding cars side by side
then noah cranks the wheel and slams the taurus sending it to the left of the divider
but his wheels catch the island and the snaps and rolls right into noahs car clips the pumps
a geyser of gasoline sprays into the sky
noah recovers from the roll
throws his weight into the jammed door
it opens on the second shove
which ignites automatically
it erupts in flames
just getting out of the car as the station blows
they shield themselves against the explosion
there goes our only lead to the dope
we better call howard
youre both crazy
julie takes a few steps away before she decides to give them the other barrel
protect and serve
isnt that what youre supposed to do
cuz id like to know whose butt youre protecting
bad boys rev
i think we protected your uninvited butt pretty good back there
all you care about is getting your dope back
no thats not all you care about getting it back in a way that shows how fucking macho and tough you are
its all some big testosterone contest
well fuck that
as julie walks in one direction burnett blows off in the other
im chill ill handle it
not goin with it
no im starts after out
somethins julie wrong with her
just wait a minute
burnett keeps moving and grousing while lowrey chases julie down and snags her by the arm
looks for words okay
its true this whole thing started with missing drugs
but somebody i cared about
she got killed
and im not gonna lay down until this guy is dead or put away
and i promise you well take care of you
thats what im afraid of
once again julie pulls away
but lowreys got her tight
he digs deep
what do i gotta say
i need you okay
then for real i need you
julies swayed despite herself
bad boys rev
do they teach charm at the academy
some smooth shit i got on my own
he puts his arm around her and they walk back
police units surround flashing lights
julie is shaken waiting in the back of a police unit
meanwhile ruiz and sanchez join burnett and lowrey at the trunk of the toasted car
the fire crew crowbars open the lid
the trunk gives way to a ghastly toxic smell
what kinda shit was in there
smells like some kinda chemical
well get a sample and drop it back at the lab
meanwhile why dont you two go on back to club hell and see what you can dig up on these bad guys
thru thru as lowrey is checking the upstairs he finds himself staring in on the sleeping kids
one day bro
gotta get yourself some of them
lowrey hears sobbing
he gently shuts the kids door and heads down the hall to the bad boys rev
where theresa sits amongst boxes of new clothes
lowrey gives a polite rap on the door
thats not cryin i hear
wipes tears oh its nothing
i just bought some clothes
its been so long since i bought anything nice
i just wanted something to wear for marcus when he got home
but nothing looks right
starts crying again hes slipping away from me mike
i can feel it
sits next to her theresa
listen to me
nobodys slipping away from you
especially not marcus
you can take my word on that
as for the clothes
lowrey pulls a random item out of a box
just a minor fashion faux paux
those cappuccinos at lunch can do that to you
see what else we got here
burnett is preparing the couch with a pillow and blanket when he sniffs at the air
burnett lowers his nose to the cushions
the smell gets worse
burnett crawls into the bed fully clothed
this is awkward
julie calls out from the bathroom
im really sorry about the dog pee
they must be traumatized by the new surroundings
ill pay for new cushions
bad boys rev
thats perfectly alright julie suddenly flops on the bed wearing a gorgeous nightgown
can i ask you something
do you always come to bed with your clothes on
or just when theres a woman in it
im on protective duty
and i want you to feel
so im dressed and ready
ive done it before
you think marcus would wear clothes to bed while on protective duty

its a cop thing
oh i definitely have a cop thing too
hes very something sexy
and the way i came in tonight he was throwing everybody this way and that and he took control
well i drove

bad boys rev
thats right you did

a womanll do anything to keep a man like that

im feeling a little
i dont know

i feel a little funny

burnetts out of bed like a shot and headed for the living room
bad boys rev
lowrey is admiring his work
theresa turns looking transformed in the outfit put together by lowery
you think hell like it
i mean i want him to you know want to
the phone rings
lowrey is talking and picking up the phone at the same time
someone i knows gonna burn you right to the ground
then into phone youre on the mic with mike
camera is tight on burnetts face
hes angry as he stares at the phone
his worst fears have been confirmed
he hangs up
bad boys rev
an angry burnett pulling on a jacket he throws some clothes at julie
usually the guy throws me out after he fucks me
im a cop
and now i gotta kill a guy
from the top of the stairs we see and hear
gnight uncle mike
good night uncle mike
lowreys at the window
parked just down the street is the same sedan
he goes for the phone and dials
waits for an answer
its me lowrey
same to you pal
i got something youll want a piece of
grinding gears burnett stops around the corner from his house
he turns off the ignition and turns to julie
i got some jewelry for you
before julie can respond burnetts cuffing her to the steering wheel
first you dont want me
then you drag me out
bad boys rev
then she gets it oh wait
i get it
youre one of those post adolescent assholes who didnt get any car sex in high school just shut the fuck up
i wont be long
try and keep out of sight
burnetts out of the car with the keys
julie yanks on the handcuffs then goes for the glove box
but this time its empty
casper spots burnett nearing the house
theres our guy
lowrey climbs under blanket on sofa the back of which faces the window
exhausted he turns off light and closes his eyes
burnetts face pops up furtively in window his nose pressed against the glass looking for evidence of adultery
he cant see lowrey asleep on the couch
his head drops below the window frame only to reappear in another window
seeing nothing he moves on
burnett skulks into the side yard
the light in theresas bedroom is on
he sees her sil houette against the curtain getting undressed
he climbs the trellis to second story boosts himself onto ledge inches along
stops to peer into a window when the ledge under his feet crumbles and
bad boys rev
landing flat on his back on the awning
his eyes close with a look that says saved
but then as he moves
thru thru theresa hears something and runs to the door and calls out
in a heartbeat lowrey charges into theresas room in his underwear
whats the matter
i heard a noise
i think someones outside
seemingly stuck once again he attempts to move
another even louder creak then gives way
and burnett crashes loudly into the garbage cans underneath
lids and cans go every which way
a lid rolls down and into the street
casper and ferguson look curiously as the lid rolls into the street
he crawls to his feet and as he looks up at the damage hes done bad boys rev
he sees lowrey in his underwear and theresa in her night gown as they part the curtains and look out
in the bushes
he assumes the worst
go into the kids room turn the lights out and wait there until i come get you
lowrey takes gun from holster slams in clip
lowrey switches off the porch lights as he exits house gun ready
without warning burnett leaps from the bushes onto lowreys back
tumbles into the flower bed
lowrey reels with an elbow dropping burnett to the lawn
but burnett rolls and clips lowreys legs
crawls for his gun
gets hold of it turns and is ready to fire when drives past
the headlights revealing burnett
what the fuck you doin theresa
me and theresa
i hope you used protection
cause i dont want a fourth kid that looks like you
bad boys rev
lowrey hauls back and belts him
burnett tears into lowrey and the two roll around on the lawn
they cant believe their eyes
wanna explain what this shits about
this whole deal has turned you stupid
youre seeing things that arent there
bad boys rev
picks up a snail and i suppose this isnt here
you were going to put snail guard on the lawn remember
are you okay
im fine theresa
whispers will you get the hell out of here before she sees you
youre supposed to be in cleveland
yeah i wouldnt want to spoil your little arrangement
and wheres julie
you didnt leave her again
shes in the car
got her cuffed to the steering wheel
lowrey could kill now
hes on his feet grabbing burnett by the collar and shoving him up against the front door
through grit teeth now listen to me
look over my right shoulder
what do you see i said look
looks late model ford
so who do you thinks in there
ed mcmahon come to tell us were sweepstakes winners
what are we doing about it
were doing nothing
ive got it handled
in the meantime you better get back to where you belong before i shoot you myself
lowrey holds and watches burnett run off to the porsche keeping the sedan in his periphery the entire time
it pulls out and drives right past the sedan
julie in full animated view
casper sees the girl
theres the girl
but just as they start the car
kuh thunk the car lurches
what the fuck
a tow truck has pulled up to the sedan and hooked it
sanchez operates the winch and ruiz guns the engine
the tow truck hauls away ferguson and casper stuck in the sedan
on the front lawn
satisfied grin on his face he returns to the house
the tow truck wheels into the stadium and stops
ferguson and casper try to make their break but the scene suddenly ignites as the orange bowl lights go on
squad cars and about ten cops surround with guns and batons
ruiz and sanchez step from the tow truck
bad boys rev
this oughta teach you not to fuck with a cops family
then the lights go out
burnett enters with julie in tow
he looks defeated grass stains on his clothes mussed hair
and here comes chet
may i have a word with you
pulls him aside i was thinking that
maybe i could see your gun
see we dont allow guns up in the apartments
lowrey usually checks his here at the desk with me
you want me to check yours
burnett pulls his gun
but doesnt hand it to chet
he sticks it in chets face
its just an option
burnett grabs julies hand and heads for the elevators
a cigar smoking sinclair supervises the lock down of the special narcotics unit
desks are being locked by ia suits
just as file cabinets are hand trucked by them
whats goin on here
wait a minute
thats my desk
lowreys going to make a move on sinclair when howard appears
bad boys rev
its exactly how it looks
s shutting us down
were all being reassigned until their investigation is over
howard pushes them into where ruiz and sanchez wait with one of last nights henchmen
his face is horribly bruised
he says he wants his lawyer
yeah but we told him we were desperate men without no fuckin jobs so
prods the guy so
all i know is his name
foo shay i think
got this heavy french accent
the word was he offs drug dealers
and there was quick cash for whoever had the balls enough to hook up with him
i swear man watchin your house was my first gig for the guy
burnett stands over the henchman and lifts his defeated chin to face him
burnett has it in him to give the guy one more hard whack for good measure but that bruised face proves punishment enough
i guess youre tellin the truth
i also got the lab report from the stuff you picked up in noahs trunk
he hands it off
bad boys rev
reading insert substance
highly volatile drying agent
the greedy motherfucker
hes cutting the dope
yeah but julie told me his ship comes in on friday

youd need whole lotta time cards to make that kinda date
or one really smart sonofabitch

and there aint gonna be any more time cards for this unit unless somebody pulls a miracle out of their ass
julies handcuffed to the steering wheel again semi draped in the front seat
she cant believe it
im getting really tired of this shit
this is a yawning tire graveyard for used and crude tires
bad boys rev
two old codgers are trading stories in front of jojo a white boy with rasta dreadlocks
through the office window jojo sees burnett and sud denly bolts out the rear door and runs smack dab into lowrey who body checks him back up against the office
good runnin into you jojo
now burnett has pushed jojo up onto the sink
lowrey hangs back vibrating with anticipation

holsters guns man its a good thing you got your memory workin
cuz that dead man paperwork is a bitch
bad boys rev
staked out around the corner are burnett and lowrey
each is clearly tired of the other
the silence is deadly until julie breaks the silence
so wheres the coffee and donuts
i thought that was the usual menu when cops were on stakeout
a little caffeine for the heart
some sugar coated dough fried in day old grease
will you get off this
youre making me sick
oh im sorry marcus
all these hours on the case you must miss theresas home cooking
near lowreys ear bet last night she fixed you up something yummy and left it in the microwave for you
burnett starts to steam
i imagine there was something yummy waiting for you when you finally made it to bed wheels listen lady but burnetts face ignites with headlights at their rear
lowrey checks the rear view mirror
he sees two private security cops named de souza and towne
they split and approach either side of the unmarked sedan
its the fuckin pretend police
bad boys rev
after tomorrow we might need em for a job reference
lowrey rolls down his drivers window in time to hear
well what do we have back here
looks like we got us two pimps and a hooker
maybe if she does us both well let you leave with your pride intact
rolls up the window lets fuck with these bozos
burnett nods his approval
lowrey lowers the window
now where were we
outta the car
hands where we can see em
both hobby cops open the doors for lowrey and burnett respectively
looks pass between them as they step out and assume the positions
and towne starts by frisking burnetts shoulders
oh thats not how you frisk a potential lawbreaker
you gotta start at the waistband
see if hes carrying a piece
towne stalls a beat then self consciously goes to burnetts waistband where he feels a gun
both hobby cops instantly withdraw their own pieces drawn and leveled on burnett and lowrey
bad boys rev
you better watch it fellahs
very slowly you know it would be very bad if you shot and killed two helpless pimps and a call girl
but it would be even worse if you shot two policemen and their witness on a stakeout
looks pass between the hobby cops
slowly turns now im reaching slowly for my shield
here it comes
just about got it
reveals his badge ooh look at that
its a detectives shield
all gold and shiny
a smart fellah wouldnt fuck with somebody who had one of these in his pocket
i guess that makes us policemen
he shows his shield
both hobby cops lower their guns unsure about whats next
burnett moves in
now some rent a cops have licenses to carry weapons where others do not
which might you be
you wouldnt happen to have those permits handy would you
from the looks on the hobby cops faces julie can see that they dont
guess we know the answer to that one
bad boys rev
de souza and towne lay face down and cuffed on the pavement while the camera lifts back to the car
i bet you miss your wife kids
i bet you miss them a whole lot
i dont worry
theyre in good hands
theresa gives a peek out the window
theres another suspicious car on the street
sanchez and ruiz are on protective duty in front of burnetts house
are you kidding man
desi was the brains behind the whole operation
thats why they called their company desilu
desi was first
coral gables stakeout
julies passed out and once again sleeping in the rear of the car
in the glow of the faltering streetlights and the approaching dawn she couldnt look more beautiful
and from his post in the drivers seat hes looking at her with a longing that goes well beyond lust
then burnett breaks the silence
the red civic
elliot shutting the door to his little red civic jangling keys as hes hurrying up the walk to the front door
he looks like he hasnt slept or showered in days
lets just hope he didnt come home for a nap
elliot exits the house in a hurry
hair wet from a shower and fresh change of clothes
he fumbles with the keys to his civic gets in and drives
im on him
to julie hey buckle up back there
lowrey has the keys in the ignition and is stomping on the gas
tailing scene as lowrey and burnett tail elliot through morning traffic
lowrey and burnetts unmarked sedan stops about two hundred yards from the freighter
elliots out of the car in a flash and crawling aboard the ship
but as he disappears casper appears with his own pair of binoculars
theyve made us
lowrey floors it
bad boys rev
lowreys driving in his typical pedal to the metal style while burnett talks on the radio
tell howard to assemble the troops
we just made the dope lab
well be at the p
in one hour
so what am i gonna do
youre gonna keep your sweet ass nice and quiet back at my place
i said mikes
lowrey rolls his eyes
he cant wait for this to end
theresa is making serving breakfast while the tv blares
quincy is channel surfing on the tv when he comes up with the news footage of the explosion followed by more footage of lowrey julie and burnett at the scene
hey its dad and uncle mike
in our continuing report on police violence the most recent incident involving two miami p
officers remains unexplained by department spokesmen
this high speed chase was captured two nights ago by our live copter news team
and while the driver was killed both police officers involved in the incident seemed to escape without injury
kids you go over to the neighbors house
ill be right back
bad boys rev
where you going
mommys going to cleveland
bang theyre through the door
grubby and tired from the all night stakeout
theresa enters building ignores chet and heads straight for bank of elevators
lady all visitors must be announced
in a motherly flash shes got chet by the ear and shes dragging him over to the elevator
he yowls the whole way until he sticks his master pass card in the elevator lock
theresa lets go
julie is framed in the bedroom doorway somewhat sadly watching burnett and lowrey scramble to get ready for the bust
so i guess when you get back its gonna be over
thats the plan
loan some of those ass kicking clothes
third drawer down
as doorbell rings hey julie
do me a favor and see who that is
bad boys rev
julie looks through the peephole then opens the door
and theres theresa
which one do you want
the tall one or the short one
oh i got plenty in me to kill em both
but its the short one im gonna divorce
she pushes past
julie watches theresa charge headlong into burnetts stripped to his pants and t shirt
while lowreys down to his white boxer shorts
hes talking and wiping down his gun with a rag
man i cant wait to see the look on howards face when we tell him
seeing theresa holy shit
save your crap mike
whatd he do
its not how it looks
it aint cleveland neither
lowrey pushes past theresa into where julie is gone
the front door is wide open
bad boys rev
she hits the close door button
but lowreys there to catch it
we wanted to tell you
i especially wanted to tell you you think i didnt know
god you are so stupid
and to think i let you use me like you did max
i know why
because you said you needed me
jesus whos the stupid one now
we still need you
he reaches for her
julie slams a fist into lowreys face
the elevator doors shut
then burnett comes hauling down the corridor with theresa at his heels
he pounds the elevator button
you stayed away from home just one night too many marcus
shes a material witness
it was orders
the elevator doors open and julie makes for exit
she sees a cab parked outside slips back on her spiked heel and starts to run for it when enters with casper and ferguson to either side
bad boys rev
they sweep into the lobby stalling just inside the doorway when they realize that their target is right there in front of them frozen like a deer caught in the
to the right and left people at the mailboxes
chet on the phone behind the desk
but hes looking at julie
but the doors to the second elevator open
bad boys rev
burnett and lowrey step out in time to see julie looking to them and the bad guys about to make their move
fouchet and his henchmen left
burnett and lowrey to the right
and julie in the middle
fouchet is the first one to draw down
guns drawn and blazing
all three villains plus burnett and lowrey diving and firing
scream and duck for cover
smoke and plaster fill the air
pushes theresa back into the elevator making her lay on the floor as bullets cut above
slips behind a pillar as bullets whiz past
in the middle
crawling for cover when with balls the size of pennsylvania
two guns in hand walks forward with barrels fixed and firing
clips out on one tosses the gun aside then with his free hand reaches down and grabs julie by the hair and lifts her until she stands
bad boys rev
with a gun in her side he backs away and shoves her through the exit
casper and ferguson follow
swings around the pillar gun leveled and running after them
meanwhile into the open elevator burnett slides his gun over to her
and dont let anybody in but me
burnett presses the close door button
the doors close just as theresa reaches for him calling marcus i love you
fouchet shoves julie into a waiting car
all three bad guys pile in and the car peels rubber just as lowrey makes the doorway
lowrey doesnt stop
he doesnt even wait for traffic
in nothing but his underwear he appears from the building turns the corner out the door launches into traffic like a shot spinning off bumpers chasing fouchets car on foot
fouchets car slides into the intersection and stalled traffic
to the right a footbridge
the car swings a hard right
where a male nurse pushing an old man in a wheelchair are in the way
the nurse tumbles up and into fouchets windshield
empty and spinning
metal pylons imbedded in concrete
out of the car
the doors fly open and all three are out in the middle of the stalled traffic julie being drug along with them
the gang cuts down an alley
turns the corner running up over car roofs and hoods
he lowers his gun and tries to draw a bead on fouchet and the gang
theyve got julie and now theyre running
appears behind lowrey
lowrey waves him in another direction
burnett hauls one way
lowrey the other
old ladies getting their hair blued and curled when bang
fouchet and the gang enter
he dives to the floor as casper stops and fires
bullets rip through the salon walls and mirrors
lowrey ends up under an old ladys dress
exiting the beauty salon and stumbling through a crowded cafe runs fouchet and the gang mauling their way through tables and patrons
lowrey only moments behind pushing his way through the same path
fouchet stops right in the middle
picks the first car thats headed for him
levels a gun on a taxi cab and fires two quick rounds bam bam
the driver of the car instantly slumps
fergusons seen this before
hes around to the drivers side of the car pulling the dead man out and leaving him on the street
casper and fouchet shove julie inside and theyre off again
but here comes burnett
hes got no gun
so he jumps aboard fouchets car just as it gets into gear
the wheels spin
the car lurches ahead
ferguson aims his pistol upward
hes about to fire into the roof when julie shoves him
gunshots ring out sideways
bullets rip to either side of burnett
then fouchet stomps on the brake and burnett tumbles forward and onto the pavement
he rolls makes it to one knee
but his other leg gives way
he sees his chance and guns the engine
the cab barrels at burnett whos stuck in the middle of the boulevard about to become instant roadkill
then from out of nowhere here comes lowrey
dashing out across the boulevard and snatching his partner from the deadly grille of the cab
hauls on by
leaving burnett and lowrey in a heap of their own both trying to catch their breath
dont ever say i wasnt there for you
tac teams and uniform cops swarm around their cars
all waiting as burnett and lowrey arrive in their unmarked car
its about fuckin time
we lost the girl
but you found the dope right
so lets go get it back
a bicycle bell rings
and here comes a boy on his bike serpentining his way through the maze of cars and cops until he gets to lowrey burnett and howard
which one of yous lowrey

from his back pocket the boy extracts a cellular flip phone
he hands it to lowrey
he presses the power button and almost instantly it rings
presses send yeah
this is lowrey
while dope is lifted and loaded from the open hold fouchet is revealed at the other end of the cellular call
i have something for you to listen to
fouchet lifts his pistol and fires a single shot
he jolts at the sound of gunfire
where the camera swish pans across to a very dead elliot
that bullet just killed the chemist
now i have but four hours left to make my deal
fuck with my timetable and the next bullet kills the girl
julie is gagged and sitting on the floor scared shitless
hes in a vice

hangs up the snitch who tipped us to the dope lab
turns out to be a bogus address
ill kill the little prick for you
thats cuz youre already dead
waves at the troops okay you guys
put em back in the lockers
en masse all the cops act as if the wind had been knocked from their sails
empty save for the daytime regulars at the bar and burnett and lowrey in a rear booth
howd he know we were gearing up to go
its like hes known all along where were gonna be and when
you know that once he sells the dope hes gonna kill her just like he did max
three little angels
julie kept talking about his three little angels
a barkeeper appears with two beers
burnett automati cally reaches for his wallet
where out pops a picture of his three children
if she dies im done with it
the whole cop thing
looking at his kids three little angels
francine is at her file desk
looking pretty much the same as always
same easy manner
then the camera revolves around her and settles on those pictures on her desk
her three little boys including the one in uniform
the camera tilts to standing over her desk
neither of them smiling
whats the joke
as she gets nothing back really
i want to know
soon though the facade fades
francine knows shes been caught
burnett holds the door while lowrey holds francine
shes broken crying and giving up the ghost of her past
it was a birthday party
you know after hours
just the civilian staff
we were drinking
they all had boy friends or their husbands
so you were alone
he was so nice to me
he said i was beautiful too
i guess i wanted to believe him
then ashamed starting to shake he took some horrible pictures of me
i dont remember any of it
id had too much to drink
i wondered if hed drugged me
he threatened to show them to my boys
my little angels
said hed pin the pictures up on the grade school bulletin boards for all their classmates to see if i didnt do what he wanted
he wanted someone inside the p
at first it was about drug busts
dealers under surveillance
hed steal from them before we could make the case
and then when the department gave the air conditioning to mr
anything you can tell us about him
what do you say about someone who rips off drug dealers
a man like that aint scared of nobody
not the police
not you guys
beat hes the scariest man i ever met
but does he still trust what you tell him
fouchet is supervising the loading of the dope onto three canvas backed military styled trucks when his cellular phone rings
francine is on the phone with howard on another extension
i have some more information for you mr
a florida power van
burnett and lowrey wearing headsets listening in on the conversation between fouchet and francine
hes surprised to hear from francine

they know the deals going down in just two hours
so theyve deployed agents to every point of entry airports marinas etc
is that all
im very pleased francine
youre the best pet ive ever had
he hangs up
back in the van lowrey turns to sanchez
ma bell says as long as he keeps his cellular phone turned on we can track him
tell him were gonna need lotsa back up
three trucks making their way through miami
ferguson is seated and staring across at julie
across his lap is a shotgun
she may be bruised and abused
but shes still got some bite
i forget the formula
big gun big dick
little gun big dick
big gun little dick
i think thats it
the camera zeroes in on his cellular phone
the power light is green
sanchez gives the update
theyre turning north onto the orange highway
we can make better time if we cut across the biscayne bridge
the van cuts across traffic barely making the ramp which swirls up onto the bridge
the dope convoy rolls over the camera
as the convoy makes a right turn off the highway onto an old tar and gravel track
the trucks roll toward an old airport which consists of a small pilots terminal and four or so hangars spread out over the ten acre site
two henchmen for the buyer open the yawning doors of this massive five story hangar to reveal a c cargo aircraft
the convoy of trucks enters
the surveillance van is parked at the side of the road
through a floor mounted spotting scope we see the last of the trucks roll into hangar and two of the buyers henchmen shut the doors
thats where theyre making the deal
burnett swivels the spotting scope
panning left and right across the landscape of tall reeds and distant buildings
finally he stalls on a garbage truck and its four man crew rolling dumpsters
fouchet shakes hands with the buyer
upon which time one forklift begins to drive pallets full of cash from the open cargo door of the aircraft while another drives pallets full of dope
three hundred million and very very fresh
too much to count eh
as casper pulls her from the rear of a truck and handcuffs her to the door of a cab
whos the bimbo
simply part of another transaction
the operation moves swiftly
dope pallets for cash pallets
smooth just like the original heist
two fuel trucks are moved in to gas up the aircraft
rounding the corner from hangar here comes the garbage truck
closer inspection reveals ruiz and sanchez at the helm with both lowrey and burnett hanging from the sides
all of them wear dirty white jumpsuits and protective masks
the two buyers henchmen stiffen at the sight of the oncoming truck
their hands slip inside their coats to mp ks slung under their armpits
but it veers and swings over toward two nearby dumpsters
with sanchez keeping a wary eye on the two bad guys and ruiz to operate the hydraulics burnett and lowrey drop from the truck and do their best working for
the city amble over to the dumpster
business as usual
they wheel it over and position it in front of the two lifting forks where the garbage appears to be expertly lifted and dumped into the truck
as it lowers the gearing seems to get hung up
the hydraulics arms wont work leaving the dumpster stuck in the air
begin speaking spanish one blaming the other for this fiasco
finally ruiz has had enough
he tosses down his gloves and hat and begins stomping off as if hes just quit his stinking job
hes headed right for the henchmen his mouth moving and spewing and moving and spewing
the henchmen look to each other not knowing what to think
ready for anything when both burnett and lowrey are right behind the henchmen with guns at the base of their necks
mouths shut feet moving
as it lifts once again to the air this time dumping the two henchmen into the truck
as the human garbage is deposited
the buyer buckles himself into the pilots seat of the c
his crew shuts the cargo hatches and he gives a pleased salute to fouchet
the engines turn over and the propellers move
loaded with cash theyre ready to go
fouchet gives the signal to open the doors
move to open the doors
they give a good shove
so they bang and shout
wake up out there
open it up
one of the dumpsters is parked in front of the doors
just as casper and ferguson give a helpless look to fouchet
the garbage truck barrels through the rear wall instantly colliding with the left wing section of aircraft
the wheel assembly buckles and the aircraft twists onto one wing
tossed from his seat and thrown across throttle
the the tarpaulin rips and a pallet of cash busts open
money swirls inside the hangar
henchmen ready to kill
then pop up burnett and lowrey
mp ks in hand
they blaze the cargo doors and cut down the rest of the buyers henchmen
rip across the dumpster moving up into the truck cab
ruiz and sanchez dive and roll to either side
meanwhile the sparks ignite the spilled fuel
move it or lose it
burnett and lowrey climb from the dumpster and run
casper and ferguson have a clear shot
they level and aim but
the fuel tank on the aircraft explodes
the truck drivers dive for cover
charging for the open hole in the wall
inside the aircraft the precious dope catches fire
looking through the flames
shielding their eyes
ruiz and sanchez appear from behind
the two bad guys turn with their guns
the flames igniting their already battered faces
but they dont turn fast enough
both cops fire in unison
ferguson and casper fall
pull back one aircraft engine still roaring
the money swirling and burning falling from the roof like a fiery rain
and easing through the wreckage ever so cautious
her voice echoes
hes handcuffed himself to julie dragging her deeper and deeper into the hangar
the smoke is getting thicker and swirling with the burning cash
signals between the two
they split wider
moving toward those locked doors
at the locked doors
he shoves against them in a futile rage
julie begins to choke on the fumes
each placing their faces against their own sleeves
the smoke is thicker swirling in waves
shoving the doors
pushing and pushing
then appear lowrey and burnett
twenty yards apart and closing
guns carefully aimed
fouchet pulls julie close
i was going to fuck her then kill her
now it looks like im only going to do the latter
either we o
on the air or the whole place blows
were dying anyway
let her go and youll walk
you can keep the dope and the money
coughs just the girl and we all get out of here
what if i dont have the key
he threw it in the yanks her shut up
unless you move aside
burnett eases further right
gun carefully aimed
his eyes are stinging
lowrey goes left
but hes lowering his gun
pulls julie closer
gun at her head
looking to burnett
while lowrey is nodding to julie
nodding for her to
burnett has a clear shot when swing wide and way way open
and about fifty cops at the ready
fouchet julie lowrey burnett
all with the same idea
they bolt for daylight as fast as they can go because explodes in such a concussion it knocks all four of them to the dirt
the hangar crumbles
as he looks back on the conflagration
sanchez and ruiz
then he yanks her back up onto her feet wild eyed
hes still got the gun on her
hands up for all the cops to see dont shoot
hold your fire
twisting julie for all to see
the cops rifle sights all glinting in the sun
ill kill the girl
bad boys rev
fouchet raises julies hand high in the air to show all of them the handcuffs when ka pow
a shot rings the link is snapped in two by the bullet
julie falls to the ground
while unload their clips in a crescendo of gunfire
fouchet crumples in a heap
the eye behind the smoking sniper rifle
he reveals a pleasured smile
then he turns to sinclair who stands only feet away
investigate that asshole
she finds her feet and runs to lowrey
right into his arms
he holds her tight but she winces from a nasty cut on her shoulder
this shit really hurts
ill give you a bullet to bite
finally they appear
alive and well
big grins helping burnett to his feet
brushing him off
then with a smile lets go get our jobs back
bad boys rev
the front door opens and all the little burnetts come screaming out
daddy daddy daddy the hero
into the arms of their father
he gathers them all into one big hug
behind burnett appear lowrey and julie arm in arm
the kids run to
uncle mike uncle mike
theresa framed in the front doorway looking smashing in the outfit lowrey picked out for her
burnett ambles up the walk into her arms
they hug and kiss theresa tossing a wink lowreys way
and watch the leather and windows this time
you got a real way with kids lowrey
you see anybody complaining
where are the kids goin
didnt you know
we got us a new babysitter
she kisses him
its quality time marcus
bad boys rev
burnett shuts the door on the camera
the screen goes to black
then under credits thru thru little megan is on the potty
she catches lowrey as he passes
i did it
