a taped hip hot drum beat starts
suddenly amber glides into center spot
now wearing lisas costume sleeves rolled up
her feet burst into an amazing routine
the loud drum beats seem to fly from her hands and feet as they punctuate the rhythm
theres no glitz just unbelievable skill
it appears effortless as she floats around stage

she concludes center stage with the greatest thirty seconds of her life
the audience goes wild
amber takes bow after bow they love her
gladys enters quickly mic in hand
gladys contd okay okay okay

slowly turning yes
i know it doesnt matter but on my inner thighs
hank rubs his head then angrily gets out of the truck overalls
he starts to walk but cant eventually leaning out from the truck only moving his arms as if walking
hank still stuck in the door is being teased by a group of kids who poke at him with flags and sticks
another little kid taunts him with his cotton candy keeping it just out of his reach
hank bats at them like frankenstein and the torch wielding townsfolk
hank still stuck in the door holds the little kid by the back of the shirt in one hand and eats the kids cotton candy with the other
the kid struggles to get away
a few broken flags are scattered on the ground
on swan float

twin officers followed by cops tv crew run up and aggressively tackle gladys
as the struggle on the ground continues crew guys go over and shake hands with the cops crew obviously knowing them
