flashs the message kicks in and as main titles roll we
a tricked out cadillac escalade with the windows tinted deep black rolls into frame
its like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder how i keep from going under
passes three people doing tai chi on a bluff overlooking the ocean
broken glass everywhere people pissing on the stairs you know they just dont care
passes a gorgeous labrador retriever snatching a frisbee midair
cant take the smell cant take the noise got no money to move out i guess i got no choice
passes two horse back riders galloping along the beach
rats in the front room roaches in the back
passes a gleaming mansion with a massive putting green like lawn
junkies in the alley with a baseball bat
passes blonde little leaguers playing baseball in crisp new uniforms
a crazy lady livin in a bag eatin outta garbage pails used to be a fag hag
passes two rich housewives clutching shopping bags from the most expensive stores on the planet
dont push me cuz im close to the edge im tryin not to lose my head
drives through a security gate and into a gated community of brand new mansions
its like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder how i keep from goin under

the press begins shouting questions

bill is instantly flustered and tom gibbons bills campaign manager african american but the soul of william f
buckley steps in front of bill
thank you for all your questions but weve run out of
just then the ground shakes with a frightening rumble
everyone quiets down is it an earthquake
as the rumble hits again the surface of the water in the koi pond ripples a la jurassic park
reporters look around anxiously as another rumble hits bills face falls as he sees
the escalade rolls into the driveway hopping up and down on its amped up hydraulics like something from crenshaw boulevard on a friday night
the rear doors pop open and mocha a
chadwick van pelt dressed head to toe in hip hop gear steps out of the passenger side

brad holds out his fist and bill reluctantly hits it
on his way out brad chest bumps tom
bill youve got to shut this down now

i love his enthusiasm
its just a little misguided
there must be something he can do for the campaign where he cant hurt us
i dont know
phones stuffing envelopes making signs something
bill is at the end of a stirring speech to the womens organization of california
in bill gluckmans administration women will have better health care women will have better day care and women will have better jobs
from here on in my campaign has a new slogan
tom signals brad who enthusiastically yanks a cord and we
unfurls behind bill
it is spray painted graffiti style and reads bill gluckmans down with the bitches and brad looks on proudly tom closes his eyes a migraine kicking in
an angry mob of women chase the limo as it backs down the driveway full speed
stunned hollow bill gluckmans down with the bitches and hos
it was supposed to read women are first with gluckman

the limo pulls in

bess and bill sit off to the side

sighs yes okay

im the shiznit
ill buy yall cars
and when did you first start feeling like you were this
way back in the day
ive had these beats in my head since i was a little shortie
toddler brad years old sits on the floor playing with a toy as gladys brads housekeeper african american thirty vacuums while listening to her walkman
the phone rings gladys pulls off her walkman headphones and answers the ringing phone
brad takes the headphones and pulls them over his ears
no bill and bess are out of the country until december
his eyes go wide as the hip hop gold enters his head for the first time
from then on it was hip hop seven
seven year old brad sits alone at the table wearing a run dmc hat a la rock box playing with his food
his headphones around his neck blare nwa
finish those vegetables bradley
you cant be excused until you do
reveal on the table across from brad is a video conference system
both parents are on separate monitors besss has a sign that reads paris and bills reads tokyo
there is a place setting in front of each monitor as if theyre dining with him
thats it mister
when we get home
sometime in the near future
youre going to be in big trouble
using the remote brad changes the channel on his parents monitors to yo mtv raps
what im sensing brad is that your parents werent really there for you
defensive thats ridiculous
what about your bar mitzvah
bill and bess enter with suitcases
the house is crowded with relatives and brads year old friends
mazel tov bradley
uncle louie fifty and fat with prayer shawl and yarmulke moves past them and calls out to brad whats the theme of your party kid
reveal thirteen year old brad dressed like flava flav a big clock around his neck looking like hes just smelled a fart
brad exits through french doors and as we follow him
its like weve suddenly stepped into a hard core rap video big bootied home girls in bikinis freak with clean cut jewish kids as the staff serve barbecue and malt
liquor to the freaked out guests
among them we see a year old hadji monster and mocha all nicely dressed for temple
above a huge spray painted banner reads mazel tizzov b rad on his bar mitzvah
bess sniffles and dabs her eyes
bess im sensing youd like to share
b rad youre a wonderful son
its just that well oh stop beating around the bush bess
what were trying to say is brad that your behavior is well its an embarrassment to the family
yo pops that hurts my feelings
im sorry but its the truth
dont be hatin
i cant have you on the campaign any longer
oh thats how it is
i need to take a drive
brad leaves slamming the door behind him
what can we do doctor
well his lack of parental guidance left brad wide open to outside influence allowing hip hop culture to firmly imprint on his psyche
do you think we can bring him back
grim i dont know
this is the most advanced case of gangsta phrenia ive ever seen
oh no not gangsta phrenia
brad relaxes in a lounge chair wearing sunglasses and sipping on a forty
bess enters wearing a chanel suit
she sits on the lounge chair next to him
bradley i know youre busy but we need to talk
brad lifts his sunglasses and turns to his mother
after our therapy session i realized that your father and i could have been better parents
we neglected you and i feel terrible
malibus most wanted rev
nd pink for real
so from here on out im going to be a better mother
i want to get closer to you
be there for you
if ever you need just then her cell phone rings
she pulls it out from her hip and answers
when did you get back
oh my god
ive been waiting for that bag for six months
to brad covering phone its my personal shopper
back to phone stay right there
im on my way
im always here for you bradley
do you have my cell number
she hands brad a piece of paper and exits
brad pulls down his shades and takes a long sip from his forty
brad sits at the massive dining room table as gladys pours him a big glass of grape juice then cuts up his food
ever feel like you dont belong
all the time baby
most folks only feel comfortable around folks who are the same as them
when they meet someone different they get scared and angry wanna keep em down
what do you do about it
nothin to do but keep it real
be proud of who you are
yeah you right
gladys when they gonna leave our people alone
emotional i dont know baby i just dont know
notices brads plate eat your greens before they get cold boy
a pager goes off
brad searches his pockets pulls out a pager thats not it pulls out another pager thats not it either pulls out a two way thats the one
reading pager oh no not again
he gets up and runs out of the room
bill tom the staff and several aides of varying ethnicity are mid meeting
howd it go with feldman
if he sees brad five days a week he says well see improvement in three to four years
the elections in two months
right good point
weve been brainstorming on some different approaches and i think we may have something solid here
im all ears
the team gathers around its a gang pitch
brad might act ghetto but lets face it hes never been east of beverly hills
but what if we give him a little dose of reality
let him get a firsthand look at the ghetto
you mean have brad actually
itll be perfectly safe
how does it work
we hire actors to play gangsters
they car jack brad then take him on a tour of the hood
give him a little taste of what thug lifes really like
it might just scare the black out of him
tom gets strange looks from everyone
look im as down as the next brother guy
i grew up in compton okay
but lets get over the p
thing and face facts
unless we do something soon brads gonna cost us this election
the team all nods
i dont know
it sounds so drastic
maybe drastic is what brad needs bill
he is twenty four
i mean whats he gonna do for a living rap
they all chuckle
who do we get for the gangsters
remember the anti crime spot we shot last month
weve got it cued up
they turn to the tv and gary hits play
on the monitor a gluckman campaign ad plays
a young black gangbanger sean glares at camera
for too long street violence has torn californians apart
a second banger pj glares at camera
bill gluckman wants to put our divisions behind us
we cut wide to reveal bill gluckman standing in between the two gangbangers
hes in shirtsleeves tie loosened
fellas instead of thinking of yourselves as what set youre from or what crew youre rolling with why cant you both be brothers
what do you say
i guess we never thought of each other like that
me neither dawg
pj and sean think is over nod and shake hands
turning to camera california is my family
cut to angle on bill and the gangbangers playing basketball having a wonderful time
if we work together as a family theres no telling how high we can go
bill flies by obviously from an o
trampoline and soars over the gangbangers for a monster dunk
freeze on the two awestruck gangbangers
as they talk we see brad out the window raising a banner
those are our guys right there
will he be safe
fed up and confused i dont know
cant we just
he looks out the window and sees brads new banner
it reads in graffiti colors election erection
alright fine just do it
brad urgently runs into the mali brew coffee shop starbucks clone where he and his crew spend ninety percent of their time
he is stopped at the door by a very worried mocha and monster
you dont want to see him like dis
why didnt you stop him
i tried yo
how many did he do
like twelve thirteen i dont know
brothas caffeined out
brad pushes past and looks on in horror at hadji pacing and talking to himself like a rabid dog on angel dust
ima get mine
ill cut you i swear

i was pickin up aromatherapy candles at illuminations for moms right
and the counter trick gave me lemon when i specifically axed for lilac
brad turns to hadji
its on now
music public enemys fight the power kicks in as we brad followed by his crew exit ready for battle
were still listening to fight the power only now its a muzac version piped in through the malls pa system
brad hadji monster and mocha strut through the mall
rich shoppers get out of the way
brad and his crew approach the old woman cashier
we got some hard core drama bout to go down right neow

tom standing by a limo is speaking with sean and pj dressed as their actual preppy selves
incredulous hold the phone buddy
you want us to scare this kid until he starts acting like a nice little white boy again
dont think you can handle it
of course i can handle it
i studied at juilliard for gods sake
tom hands them a manila envelope
heres some background information on brad
pj pulls brads cd from the envelope
it is brad throwing the malibu sign surrounded by women in thongs with gigantic asses
the title in graffiti font reads mali bootay
he considers himself a rapper
they all laugh
tom hands them a checklist itinerary
okay so heres the story its your basic kidnapping
so we hold him for ransom
but when you see him acting ghetto and all it pisses you off so much you tour him around the hood to show him what things are really like
hands pj a list i had my guys brainstorm a few ideas
reading list mugging drive by shooting crack deal gone bad
why dont you have him steal some watermelon while youre at it
pays fifteen grand apiece
quickly were in
wait were kidnapping him couldnt we get arrested

what about the money
pulls out a smaller envelope
five up front twenty five when you return him to us white
as the driven snow

after years of training and study the only parts theyll give us are gangbangers
just once id like to play a character who has decent grammar and doesnt wear timberlands

they think then come up with it at the same time
in a wienie in a bun uniform chewing gum and looking like shes smelling something nasty
shes at the counter facing sean and pj
pj studies the menu

sean yanks the wig off and whips it into the corner
pj has on baggy jeans
sean yanks them down so his boxers are hanging out
pj smiles perfect
pj and sean now in full gangsta gear practice their pimp struts
sean and pj stand side by side in front of a full length mirror practicing making angry faces and pulling guns from their pants as we
his face filled with rage

add a beeyotch and i think youre there
music the music segues from our montage rap beat to mochas human beat box as we
as a car door opens boots hit the pavement and shondras incredibly fine ass slides into frame
we follow it as it moves to shondra enters looking ghetto fab hot
people look at her like she just landed from mars
she raises her sunglasses sees brad and crew playing dominoes at a table
brad slaps down the winner points at monster
im thin to win
raps to monster the name is b rad not robbie van winkle

they pound and congratulate brad on his brilliance
shondra drops her shades back down and moves in
hadji sees her first

everything goes slow strutting toward him

take this exit
brad swerves across three lanes of the freeway to take the exit and suddenly finds himself actually in south central
hes awestruck he notices a homeless guy with a shopping cart loaded with bags of stuff
he really should use delivery
suddenly sean pops his head into the car and stares directly at brad

pj smiles and shows him the gun again
brad swallows and approaches the counter
the korean guy behind it watches him closely
yeah uh where the old english at

brad hurries to the back of the store and spots a door by the beer cooler
he tries to open it
brad looks up to the security mirror and sees that the korean guy is watching him
he moves to the beer cooler and tries to calm down
namyoho renge kyo namyoho renge kyo namyoho renge kyo and whatnot

brad tries a cleansing breath
it doesnt help either
brad gathers up an armful of old english s and heads for the front
the korean guy watches him as he walks past the counter toward the door

and whatever else i want
brad drops the beer
it crashes to the floor in slow motion
brad makes a crazy threatening face as he pulls back a fist but the korean guy throws a fast right hand landing squarely on brads chin
brad goes down like a sack of hammers then we flashback to moments earlier we realize weve just been in a fantasy as brad again approaches the counter with his
can i help you

they continue to argue as we
brad finishes reaching into his waistband for the glock but feels something else

bill and tom lie facedown on matching massage tables while massage therapists rapidly pound their backs

a meet and greet with greenpeace then drinks with the offshore oil lobby

they shove brad into the club then turn to each other and giggle like school girls

they pound and follow brad into the club
brad enters and takes in the club
hardcore gangster types and some tough home girls check out rapper drop whose ferocious gravel voiced raps show you exactly what kind of place youre in
how you feelin now malibu
finally a place where i feel at home
disgusted get yo ass in there
brad boldly fist shakes jaw dropped patrons as he wades through the crowd ad libbing whassup
and pardon me homey
drop finishes and the mc brings up steel and young dre announcing the battle rap competition
steel and young dre battle both are top notch
at every insult the crowd roars
shondra is talking to a home girl checking out the crowd below
she suddenly sees brad
shes eyes wide horrified
steel finishes the crowd cheers and young dre starts in on the mic
sean and pj leave brad and fight through to the dj table where the mc is standing timing young dre
brad looks around then up
he sees shondra and starts for the stairs

she turns and faces tec her ex boyfriend a no nonsense roughneck gangbanger
hes very soft spoken almost expressionless

tec feels everyone looking at him

he releases brad and composes himself
yall both gonna be sorry
tec stalks off
coughs im okay

shondra grabs brad and moves him to the stairs
sean and pj finally make it to the mc who stands with the dj
sean bumps the dj table
a vicious look from the dj as sean tries to play it off
the mc just looks at him disdainfully
my boy want young dre next
the mc looks them over
maybe a c note would open some
takes the cash whats his name
the mc makes a face but puts down brads name anyway
enthusiastically hey playa

shondra i gots to do dis

shondra cant argue
brad starts to the stage
a wave of shock as the crowd realizes who b rad actually is
this is gonna be like an episode of oz
brad gets his game face on and walks the gauntlet on his way to the stage an imposing path of intimidating looks
he is then dragged up onto the stage
he misinterprets the antagonizing chants as encouragement and tries to high five the crowd no takers
the mc and young dre laugh at him
nah nah nah

the crowd laughs
brad cluelessly laughs along with them
a ight a ight

brad laughs turning to the crowd to appreciate his lame burn
young dre looks furious
young dre grabs the mic and the dj spins
young dre proceeds to incinerate brad
with every line the crowd goes insane
note actual young dre rap to come
as young dre flows brad is visibly shaken but tries to play it off not so discreetly scribbling notes on his hand and up his arm
young dre finishes with devastating blow dropping the mic on the stage
the crowd goes wild
now lets see if this eminem melts in yo ass and in your hand
the dj kicks the beat and the mc throws brad the mic
he misses it and it drills him in the forehead
the crowd laughs
brad tries to regain his composure
can we start again
i lost my place
taunts and laughs as the beat plays again
brad wags his head ready to come in strong
he looks down at his notes
hes sweating so badly his arm is a mess of runny ink
he freezes again
the crowd is really on him now collectively making the choke sign
brad finally starts up
you big and rough you act all tough i bet in your childhood you never had much love
finishing alert the media im a rap encyclopedia my shrink says i suffer from a case of gansta phrenia im tryin to be meania im feeling much vigor im the
bus number one hardcore niggaa
terrified to sean lets get the hell out of here
brad looks around as blank faces stare back at him
the crowd erupts with outrage and rushes the stage
wails with terror as hes passed hand over hand above the cursing club patrons crowd surfing style toward the exit
four thugs run brad out of the back door into the
where they launch him into the dumpster with a resounding thud
brads landing causes the lid to slam violently shut and forces sean and pj whove been hiding behind it to pop up
what was that
a rumble comes from the dumpster and they pull back the lid
angle on inside the dumpster where brad lies in the bottom his fall was broken by several loaves of old wonder bread
pj and sean fall into hysterics as shondra emerges from the club
she finds pj and sean apoplectic with laughter shakes her head and begins to help brad out of the dumpster
tec watches it all going down
snuffy skinny but tough looking chollo and not a member of tecs crew is standing next to tec

brad sighs flops back down on the bed utterly depressed
brad lays on the bed moonlit through the bars of the window

she pushes him back
i said kiss fool
she gets up and heads for the door
i offered you a snack not the whole kitchen
she rolls her eyes and leaves
brad falls back on the bed a dreamy smile on his face
tec with his crew drives up lights out and kills the engine

bill drops out of the race emotional distress
i can handle bill
lets brainstorm the positives

they start riffing on the idea getting excited
with a dead son the sympathy factor could give us big spike in the female and gay demos
weve had such a problem with bills rich guy image we could spin the issue to make him more everymen you know crime touches everyone like that
what about a voter backlash like how could he run on the heels of a tragedy
no we push the courage under adversity angle
helps with his leadership profile
bill gluckman crusader martyr
ive got the image bill weeping over brads open casket
then after grieving appropriately he goes on the offensive
bill gluckmans war on crime

the phone rings and tom picks up
tec is on the phone

he hangs up and smiles
tec hangs up as he looks over brad is pulled from the trunk by two i s his mouth still taped

tecs homie rips the tape off brads mouth

tec cocks his nine and aims at brad
fearless oh what you gonna do me like this

tec is stunned the white boy isnt showing any fear
brad steps forward puts the gun to his own heart and places his thumb on the trigger
that gats real right
then do it or ill do it myself unnerved brotha straight up crazy and i cannot deal with that shit
suddenly gunfire erupts as techs car is hit with a barrage of bullets
brad the crew sean and pj drop to the street and roll under the car
tec has to dive behind a nearby dumpster
snuffy and three rollin gs are crouched behind their low rider firing away
the i s return fire
pj and sean are in the fetal position freaking out
brad thinking its all fake is laughing having a great time
lay down some cover fool
tecs pinned down behind the dumpster
hes without a weapon and rollin gs are focusing their fire on him

brad grabs the uzis and rolls out from under the car

the rollin gs try to respond but brads fire is too intense
devils got some balls
they all hop in their convertible and tear ass out of there as brad jumps off the cars and follows on foot firing after them as they turn the corner
and squeal away
its safe now yall
tec emerges from behind the dumpster
the crew rolls out from under the car followed by sean and pj
they look at brad in awe
that was ill
yall definitely got juice
he offers his fist to brad
whered you learn that shit
hal fishman reads the nights news
a channel five exclusive
a security camera captured incredible footage of gang violence tonight as it flared on the streets of south central
of brad on top of tecs car firing the uzis
this hardcore gangster believed to be the notorious white kong leader of i street gang fires his weapons with wanton disregard for human life or personal property
in slow motion as he fires
if you have any information on the whereabouts of this man call our hot line at gang
they sit in bed stunned
shes on the couch blocking a wig stunned
mocha hadji and monster holding half drunken lattes are all staring at a tv mounted in the corner
tom stares at the tv

bill grabs tom by the shirt and slams him into the wall
as bill takes off all right guys lets pitch on how i get my job back

walking out bill
the other staffers follow brett out leaving tom alone
bill hauls ass down the his headset on
this is lojack

reluctant that vehicle is at the corner of mckinley and nd
suddenly a map of south central appears with a red blinking dot at the corner of mckinley and nd
your destination is a lojack designated danger zone
lojack does not recommend you venture into this area
rap blasts in as bill punches the gas as we
a party is happening homies slam dominoes
home girlz drink beer and talk
sean and pj are standing frozen in a corner quietly crying
hip hop gangsters dancing
and finally we find tec and the other i s gathered around brad as tec solemnly hands brad a tec automatic pistol

mocha slams the butt of the musket down and the flintlock slams forward
everyone looks at the musket then suddenly it explodes and a rusty musket ball fires out slamming monster in the middle of her kevlar breastplate
she flies back and slams into the wall causing her spear gun to fire a spear shoots out and lands directly into brads left ass cheek
brad howls and drops the missile slow motion everyone watches it fall to the ground
real time it hits the floor and the missile fires
and shondra all watch in horror as the missile flies past gang members through the kitchen door and slams into the side of the gas oven
we hear a countdown beep beep beep
everyone runs for the nearest hole in the wall
bodies stream out of the house scrambling for safety when suddenly
the house blows in a huge orange fireball
we crane past emergency vehicles parked in front of smoldering remains of tecs house then move to tec who is yelling at a cop
i know my rights man and these fools drove two damn cars into my house then they blew the shit up
this all better be rebuilt before my ma comes back or she will make you wish you were never born
