written by jon lucas scott moore september its a beautiful spring morning in the palisades
high atop the cliffs looking out over the pacific ocean sits the exclusive bel air bay club
workers bustle about the lawn setting up a high end wedding
a string quartet warms up
a team of florists arrange centerpieces
caterers set the white linen tables
a simple classic wedding dress hangs on a closet door in this sun drenched bridal suite
sitting at the makeup table surrounded by her bridesmaids is the beautiful bride tracy turner s
shes busy doing her makeup
just then tracys rich stern father s blows in
any word from doug
the way he spits out doug tells us all we need to know about how mr
turner feels about his future son in law
no but im sure hes just then tracys cellphone rings
she quickly answers it
heat waves rise off the mojave
standing at a lone dust covered payphone in the middle of the desert is hes in his late s tall rugged and currently a mess
his shirt is ripped open his aviator sunglasses are bent his lip is bloodied and he clearly hasnt slept in days
tracy its vick
parked on the dirt road behind vick is his near totalled cadillac deville convertible its scratched dented filthy and missing its passenger side door
slouched inside are two other guys also looking like hell
the bachelor party got a little out of control and well
we lost doug
her jaw dropping what
but were getting married in like four hours
vick squints at the rising sun
yeah thats not gonna happen
the top down the whos baba oriley blasting from the stereo vicks pristine cadillac convertible rockets down highway towards nevada
at the wheel is vick looking as sharp as his caddy in a half open shirt and mint condition aviators
sitting shotgun is the groom doug billings late s handsome barefoot crunchy an all around great guy
behind vick sits alan mervish late s an anal tax attorney from connecticut his izod shirt tucked into his khakis
hes currently applying sun screen to his forehead
next to alan is stu pryce late s former high school linebacker and lovably dimwitted father of two
he drums the back of the frontseat to the music totally pumped like this is his first time out of the house in years
because it is
dude this is already the best weekend ever
stu relax were still on the
oh did i show you pictures of my kids
no dude show em
stu fishes pictures out of his wallet and eagerly shows them to doug in the front seat
doug is clearly the core of this group the glue that holds these childhood friends together
haylee is two and kaitlin is already four
can you believe it
smiling at photos how cute
good for you man
doug shows the photos to vick he nods impressed
the one on the left is gonna be a hottie
the other one not so much
stu protectively snatches the photos back muttering jesus dude those are my children re sunscreen hey am i rubbed in
stu glances over and sees un rubbed in sunscreen all over alans face
yeah youre good
hey so alan are you and becky still together
but before alan can answer of course they are doug
jesus alans been dating becky for years
when they first met alan had braces and soccer hair and becky had a functioning hymen
asking alan if hes still with becky is like asking the sun if it still rises in the east
the guys try not to laugh alan scowls
she still pressuring you to get married
enh weve moved past the pressure stage
its more like aggravated assault stage now
like at the last wedding we went to she threw a camera at my head called me a closet fag then ran out crying
the guys wince oooo
but we talked and everythings cool now
maybe you could wear a helmet to dougs wedding
great idea stu
so vick hows business going
yeah im working on bringing the next big dessert craze to los angeles
its gonna be huge
what is it
we ran the numbers and its gonna be bigger than fro yo
doug and stu nod impressed only alan looks skeptical
isnt custard like a trillion calories
our plan is to open three stores in the valley and then franchise it
shares are selling fast but i can probably squeeze you guys in
yeah man count me in
me too man
i love pudding
alan just shakes his head unbelievable
is this gonna do better than the hip hop label you started vick
or the topless sushi bar
or the mobile tattoo parlor
tattoo to you was an idea ahead of its time alan
and dont come crying to me when theres a custard cabana on every street corner in america and you didnt buy in
all right all right save it for the party
vick and alan quiet
stu is still drumming the seat
i cant believe i get to party all night and then tomorrow i get to sleep in
its almost too much
and fyi if anyone gets really drunk and craps themself just let me know i can have you cleaned up and partying again in under three minutes
i am a master of stool removal
they rocket off into the desert laughing
as the last rays of sun fade the cadillac crests the final hill to reveal las vegas in all its illuminated splendor
the caddy rolls down the famed strip
we are again reminded of the absurd scale of las vegas
the room hotels the eight lane roads the foot billboards
the caddy rolls up to the mandalay bay
the guys hop out exhilarated
vick throws the key to the valet
the guys enter the glittering casino four men wide all smiling all exuding vibe
passing women sneak glances
vick slides a drink off a nearby waitresss tray as they make for a perfectly pressed lebanese man waits behind the front desk
vick strides up smiling sunglasses still on
welcome to the mandalay bay
lennon comma victor
the man types into his computer
yes we have you down for a one night stay in an economy suite vick glances at the mans nametag it reads atashir
hold it right there atashir
this is my best friend from childhood douglas billings
in two days he is to marry a woman of great beauty and strong teeth do you understand
a woman of gigantic bosoms who will give him many many sons
atashir looks confused
alan looks embarrassed
my two other childhood friends have travelled great distances across many deserts to be here
this isnt a night in a hotel for us atashir this is a family reunion
perhaps you too have family situated great distances away in a foreign country with much sand
atashir looks like sort of
vick reaches over the counter and touches his arm simpatico
then i have but one question for you friend if they came to town would you put them in an economy suite
i think one of us needs to get back on his little computer and find us a suitable room
but types away at his computer
all the deluxe rooms are taken
the dean martin suite is available but id have to ask my dean o will be fine
send up a case of cristal two bottles of patron four ahi sandwiches and a crate of skinless mangos
vick turns to the guys you guys want anything
the guys stammer too stunned to speak
and have jean marie cook up a dozen of those duck skewers i like so well
he knows the ones
and how would you like to pay
atashir looks up to accept the card
after a beat vick turns to alan dude give him your amex
dont worry well hit you later
dude come on i paid for gas
stop being such a jew
alan stammers some more then angrily pulls out his card
the guys enter the room jostling stu has doug in a headlock
then they freeze the dean martin suite is massive complete with lounge area two flat screen tvs full bar and multiple bedrooms
the guys just gape
this is bigger than my house
vick blows past them totally unfazed
get dressed ladies
were wheels up in ten
stu and doug race off to find their bedrooms leaving alan standing alone just staring at the decadent suite
i am so not getting paid back
vick enters the bedroom drops his bag and starts changing his shirt when his cell phone rings
this is vick
vick listens then grows a bit panicked hes in vegas
youre kidding me
all right ill get it
when stu walks past vick turns away and covers the phone trying to keep the call confidential i said all right dude
how many more times you want me to say all right
vick hangs up looking uncharacteristically stressed
doug brushes his teeth while at the next sink over alan selects a facial wash from his highly organized toiletries kit and begins washing his face
so you ready for sunday
i thought id be nervous but im actually just really psyched
alan nods impressed
tracys dad still hate you
any closer to figuring out why
enh i think he wanted more for his girl
i mean im a teacher who makes grand a year and hes a titan of industry who makes grand a day you know
i sort of get it
beat brushing teeth also im banging his daughter
im not sure you ever get past that
alan smiles yeah theres that
doug spits out his paste
you got floss
alan gestures towards his toiletries kit
doug picks it up starts looking for the floss
then alan remembers something but its too late
doug has found the ring box inside alans kit and opened it to reveal a huge diamond engagement ring
alan quickly reaches for the ring ahhh yeah i wasnt going to tell anyone about that just then stu wanders in wearing only his colorado state boxer shorts
his gut is sizable
anyone got any nipple lube
seeing ring jesus would you look at the size of that thing
stu grabs the ring from doug
jesus who made this thing
clutching for ring actually i i was trying to keep it a secret so just then vick blows in singing effeminate boy party in the bathrooooom
sees ring snags it miners cut
carats slight pink tint street value k
vick studies it in the light
alan just rubs his temples
dude its for becky
alans finally going to propose
well gosh golly alan mervish good for you
whered you get the ring
oh its a family heirloom
my grandmother smuggled it through the holocaust actually
i was going to propose to beck this weekend
doug throws his arm around alan happy for him
well now we have two things to celebrate
the guys dressed to the nines open the steel rooftop door and file out onto the flat tar roof of the mandalay bay vick is carrying a bottle of patron
and four hotel glasses
bringing up the rear alan slides a wood block between the door and the frame so they arent locked up here
the guys step out onto the dark windy roof and take in the stunning panorama
the countless stars
thish is so great
i love you guys
check it out stus already wasted
vick starts refilling everyones glasses
weve only had two shots man
yeah what happened stuey
you used to be able to drink us all under the table
dude im a dad
i dont have time to get plastered anymore
am i a bad dad for saying that
because my dad was a bad dad
patting his shoulder thats true stuey but youre different
weve talked about this
stu just stares at the guys glassy eyed
have i showed you guys pictures of my kids yet
doug laughs and raises his glass for a toast heartfelt little toast to tracy the coolest kindest most beautiful woman ive ever met
i cant believe she let me come this weekend much less agreed to spend the rest of her life with me
i think both will prove to be massive errors of judgement on her part
the guys chuckle hear hear
and to being here with my best friends in the world
theres nowhere else id rather be
the guys raise their glasses touched
that said lets not get too stupid tonight okay
im getting married in hours
well be good
doug lowers his glass laughing completely unconvinced
im serious dudes
nothing above the neck no piercings no weird haircuts no facial tattoos
i gotta look decent on sunday
jesus what do you take us for
vick you shaved alans eyebrows off the night before graduation
that was hilarious
and remember when i blacked out at homecoming and you wrote on my face with permanent marker
that was awesome
whatd you write again
they all laugh
stu throws his arm around doug nostalgic
ahh good times man
well be good tonight doug
seriously man were your friends
yeah weve totally grown up since then
doug looks at them highly dubious then hoists his glass
to a night well never forget
they clink glasses shoot their shots and shafts of white desert sunlight pour into
the camera follows a live chicken as it walks through the totalled suite
furniture is broken the minibar ransacked and the floor is covered with remnants of the night before empty beer cans platefuls of room service food a cowboy hat the gideon
bible half eaten skinless mangos a bra a battle axe etc
snoring on the couch wearing only his jeans and one shoe the word asshole written in sharpie across his chest is stu
the chicken struts across the top of the couch until it reaches a plastic coin cup from bellagio blocking its path
then the chicken pecks it off
the cup hits stu in the face and stale beer splashes all over him
stu spastically jerks awake and flips off the couch onto a pile of newspapers
confused stu clambers off the pile of newspapers to find vick sleeping underneath on the floor fully dressed
vick pulls himself onto the couch clearly in pain
damn dude why are you retarded
both men are ragingly hungover
a long beat as both of them rub their faces then um stuey
why do you have a mullet
stu does in fact have a mullet haircut
but hes too hungover to understand
you know business on top party down the back
stu still looks confused
this is excruciating for vick
your hair dude
you have a mullet
stu touches his hair
then he stumbles into the bathroom
after a beat we hear his voice dude
i have a mullet
then we hear alans voice in the bathroom groggy just give me ten more minutes beck
whoa did you sleep in the tub
beat then stu pokes his head out of the bathroom
check it out alan slept in the tub
get him up
stu disappears back into the bathroom
we hear the shower turn on
then we hear alan slowly awaken wet
theres a thud as alan falls out of tub
then stu and a very confused very hungover very wet alan stumble out of the bathroom
alan appears to be wearing his polo shirt from the night before
only as we pull back we see that his shirt is cut off at his chest hes naked from there down
jesus dude put away your sack
alan looks down at his hairy nakedness totally bewildered
yeah and it might be time for some manscaping bro
your bush looks like yanni
alan looks back up again squinting hungover
what did we do last night
the guys now dressed stagger out of their suite moments later
stu walks incredibly bow legged like an aging cowboy
dude why is my ass killing me
looking like crap the guys silently descend in the elevator
the elevator opens to expose a nice looking couple waiting to get on
they see the guys and immediately step away from the elevator
well get the next one
the doors close
the guys continue to descend
we might not smell very good
the guys shake their heads yeah no
the guys slouch in a booth shoveling masses of buffet food into their mouths washing it down with huge mugs of coffee
this might be the worst hangover anyone has ever had ever
i cant taste anything
please stop talking
if i dont focus on eating im going to throw up all over myself
the guys nod right
they keep eating
after a long while hey
are we missing something
the guys all slowly look around
then stu points at alan yes i left my hat in the room thank you alan
they continue eating
alan looks up again still troubled
thats not it
theres something else
vick nods at stu as he stuffs food in his mouth
you gonna finish that cruller
stu shakes his head no
vick takes it packs it into his already stuffed mouth
then alan realizes doug
guys wheres doug
the guys look around
hes not here
probably left him in the room
vick pulls out his cell phone starts dialing
ill call his cell
then a phone rings in stus pocket
he answers good morning this is stu
its me meatdick
to alan concerned its vick then stu realizes
this is dougs phone
vick nods ya
hes already dialing another number
you calling the room
vick nods uh huh
he lets it ring rubbing his temples
then he hangs up
vick goes back to eating
shouldnt we look for him
check out is in like ten minutes
yeah and we told tracy wed have doug back to la by five
vick just looks at both of them his mouth full of food im eabing
what an asshole
stu check the pool and the casino ill check the room and the gym
maybe hes working out or something
stu nods and they slowly slide out of the booth
and vick if you could keep a close eye on the buffet thatd be really helpful
alan and stu saunter off
vick yells after them mouth full
vick scowls and angrily takes alans last cruller
alan weaves through the totalled suite half awake
wake up man
alan enters the bedroom where doug slept and stops
it takes him a second to realize whats wrong there are four indentations on the carpet where it once lay
alan scratches his head
stu walking bow legged squinting painfully in the bright sun tries to inspect everyone lying around the huge pool
several hot women in bikinis sit up disgusted
its cool im a dad
its totally cool
alan stumbles through the gym looking for doug
the place is packed with fit people working out
alan mumbles to himself i hate you all
stu wanders through the casino calling out incredibly loud two gay men in identical tank tops pass by holding hands
then stu registers what just happened
he stops and turns around enh
but the gay men are gone
before he can comment however he sees vick and alan talking to atashir at he slowly bow legs himself over
you find doug
no i assume you didnt either
stu shakes his head no
then atashir hangs up his phone
there is no doug billings at any of the area hospitals morgues or police stations
the guys frown starting to grow worried
maybe he went for a jog
its degrees outside
the guys just look at him like youre an idiot
so weve officially lost doug
his wedding is in what hours
relax its doug hes probably crashed out on someones couch right now
all we have to do is retrace our steps from last night and well find him
okay so last night
the guys wince trying to remember
its painful to think
well we started on the roof
right that was like ish
we had steaks at the palm
we played craps at the hard rock
that sounds right
stu throws up his arms already giving up
i dont even remember going to dinner
i vaguely recall
doing body shots at some point
im pretty much blank after the hard rock
i think we went to the flamingo after that
and then i just remember a lot of blue light
and the overpowering smell of baby oil
so that was what ish
give or take
was doug still with us
vick rubs his temples trying to fight through the hangover
doug was with us
i tackled him
for some reason
the guys nod okay okay
so we only have a hour window where we couldve lost him
they guys frown
stu puts his hands into his pockets thinking
then he feels something
he pulls it out
its from the flamingo nightclub
look we were at the flamingo
a long beat of silence
then the guys hurry to an empty blackjack table and start emptying their pockets of the detritus from the night before
they find matchbooks receipts room keys a valet ticket
atm receipt from the rio at reading it for dollars
the valet ticket says we returned here at am
we drove last night
the guys wince jesus
heres a receipt from sbarro
the meal was comped for some reason why do we have a matchbook from the golden pony all male revue
the guys exchange a look alarmed
someone couldve given that to us
laughing nervous yeah totally
theres no way we went there
were not gay
they frown then stare at all the clues lined up on the blackjack table
i think we should call tracy
what if doug called her
she might know where he is
stu shifts uncomfortably tenderly adjusting his ass
yeah im with alan on this one
of course youre with alan youre both gutless cowards
but were not calling tracy
you never call the bride from the bachelor party
if my balls were on fire and tracy was sitting next door with a tall glass of water i still wouldnt call her
its a rule
but shouldnt we at least tell her were gonna be getting home late
she has a watch shell figure it out
i think im beginning to see why youre always single
and i think im beginning to see why youre always a douche clutching his ass guys wait
i need your help oh my god like right now
jesus what is it
vick and alan unhappily stand in the lavish gold ensconsed mens room watching stu painfully undo his jeans
i cant believe were doing this
you dont have to look up my butt just at it
something is terribly terribly wrong
stus jeans fall to the ground and everyone freezes
hes wearing a snug fluorescent pink g string with i roger written vertically down the front
sweet mother of mercy
i i i dont know
what do you think it means
what do i think it means
well stuart your ass is all torn up and youre wearing thong underwear declaring your love for another dude i dont think we need the csi team for this one
you got reamed last night man
stu covers his mouth horrified
im sure theres a perfectly logical explanation for this
alan tries to think of one
yeah maybe there isnt
look im sure roger is a very nice considerate young man oh my god guys what if im gay
come on stu youre nowhere near cool enough
gasping realizing i do watch dancing with the stars with the kids
oh god that doesnt mean youre gay
but sort of
stu grows increasingly frantic
and once i caught myself gazing at a topless photo of david beckham
so what hes a great looking dude and then i had those weird feelings for vick that time in middle school remember
vick most of all
yeah that weekend we were all camping i told you this
yeah no you didnt
i think id remember dude
yeah i think wed all remember
i had weird feelings for you that weekend
like really hot really gay feelings
but then they went away
vick is just looking at him stunned
wait i was there that weekend
did you have gay feelings for me
i was a good looking kid
please youre so not his type
just then a father and his young son enter the mens room and see stu standing there pants down in his g string
look stu one homosexual experience doesnt mean youre permanently gay okay
a lot of guys test the waters
the father and son wheel right back around and exit
all right were scaring the children
the guys head for the door
stu quickly pulls up his pants
wait so have either of you tested the waters
were not gay
stu looks highly confused as he follows them out onto the guys power through the crowded casino towards the exit
stu tries to keep up genuinely concerned
how am i going to tell my wife
quickly and from a great distance
alans hand accidentally hits a brass railing and clinks
jesus what kind of father am i
alans hand clinks against the railing again and this time it registers
alan looks down and stops cold
oh my god
really scared you think erin will try to take the kids
turning annoyed what now
alan holds up the source of his clinking on his ring finger is a huge tacky silver wedding ring with a unicorn on it
not getting it cool ring
also my dad is gonna have a field day with this
vick however recognizes the implications of the ring and starts back towards alan
oh my god
oh my god
whats the big
finally realizing oh
alan steadies himself against a slot machine and shakily takes off the massive unicorn ring
maybe its not a wedding ring
reading inscription to my noble husband alan
the guys eyes bulge oh shit
this is worse than my underwear
vick takes the ring and reads the rest of the inscription now forever wedding chapel
they guys exchange a look
well at least its a lead
then alan turns and throws up all over the slot machine
nearby octogenarian slot players look over disgusted but continue playing their nickels
the three guys exit the hotel looking like crap
vick hands his ticket to the valet
alan chews mint gum
so we go to the wedding chapel we find out what we did with doug we recover him and were back in la before sundown
easy as stus ass
no one laughs
tense silence as they wait for the car
check it out some idiot threw his bed out the window last night
stu points over at a huge stone griffin in front of the hotel with an entire bed impaled upon its ear
that was us dude
yeah theres no bed in dougs room
well im sure we had a good reason for doing it
you think theyll charge us for
yeah stu i really do
everythings gonna be cool
just then the valet drives up in the exterior is scratched and filthy like its been off roading
the hubcaps are gone as is the front passenger side door
a wisp of steam trails up from under the hood
the guys just stand there agape
you okay vick
im not emotionally prepared to talk about it just yet stuart but thank you
vick dons his sunglasses and heads for his destroyed car
in their ridiculous car
cars full of families cute girls even nuns point and stare
our guys just face forward each quietly suffering in their own personal hell
seriously what am i gonna tell becky
for years shes been begging me to get married
well now you did
just not to her
alan glowers at the city going by
then he sits up wait is that homeless guy wearing dougs shirt
the guys turn to see a homeless guy weaving down the sidewalk in dougs distinctive orange shirt from the night before
once they pass the guys exchange a look
yeah that was a different shirt
alan doesnt look so sure
they drive in silence
then left turn
stu sitting shotgun braces against the empty doorframe so as not to fall out of the car as they turn left
sitting in an east vegas strip mall sandwiched between a laundromat and a pawn shop is the pink now forever wedding chapel
the cadillac parks in the lot out front
everything in the small tacky wedding chapel is white plastic
white plastic plants white plastic cross white plastic chairs
the guys enter
what if they dont remember us
the guys turn to find the hirsute owner of the chapel steve gianopolus s in a tight white suit his arms spread wide
steve is all vegas by way of long island
how are you you dumb bastards
he warmly hugs the guys
they have zero memory of him and it shows as they hug back weakly unfamiliar
to the guys you here to pick up your wedding photos
alan starts to decline when does the pope wear a funny hat
lets do this thing
steve cackles and guides them over to a table alan scowls
and where is chastity today
they all sit on white plastic chairs
your wife man
aww youre just breaking my balls
alan looks ill
laughing steve retrieves a folder and starts laying out a series of wedding photos on the table
vick eagerly peruses them enjoying this
uh it was such a lovely ceremony wasnt it
hand to god ive never seen two people more in love
sadly i believe you
the guys look at the photos of alans wedding from the night before
theyre typical wedding shots only the guys are all wearing medieval costumes swords bows tights even armor
they look incredibly happy and incredibly drunk
the next photo is of alan and his busty blonde bride
shes having a blast in a white medieval gown and tiara
alan just closes his eyes oh god
i am never
jesus she is stacked
stu please show some class
thats alans wife youre talking about
to alan guilty sorry
she looks really nice
but alan is too busy gaping at the next photo of him and chastity atop a unicorn in the chapel
it is of course a rented pony with a lame horn strapped to its head
we got a unicorn
oh yeah you got the entire double camelot package
alan just rubs his temples oh no
a and how much did that cost
alan closes his eyes
stu and vick exchange a look no way
yeah you didnt want to get it either but vick insisted
then alan pounces across the table at vick
im gonna kill you
fending him off you cant put a pricetag on love alan
you just cant
stu hops up and starts pulling alan off of vick
the guys straighten like schoolboys as steves wife carla s enters
shes wearing a toga smoking a menthol and dollying in several large cardboard boxes
then she grins ahhh
im just busting your nuts
she lowers the dolly and hurries over for hugs
good to see you you stupid mooks
stu and alan force smiles no idea who this woman is
vick on the other hand steps forward and hugs her tightly
its good to be seen carla
its good to be seen
i brought the rest of your package
carla begins unloading things from the cardboard boxes
first two dozen commuter mugs
she unpacks commuter mugs with alan and chastitys photo emblazoned on them
alan winces oh god
stu grabs one no way
a hundred dvds of the ceremony
she lays out the stacks of dvds
vick nods at alan for you and chastity to watch on your anniversary
alan just clenches his jaw i fucking hate you
the velvet wall hanging
she pulls out a six foot air brushed velvet wall hanging of alan and chastity riding the unicorn together in outer space
and it looks like real velvet alan so no machine wash okay
and the big finish vick and stu do a drumroll on the table excited
then carla pulls out a four foot bronze shield with a bas relief of alan and chastity making out on it
alan just closes his eyes
i want a shield
hey can stu and i get a shield
i dont suppose you have any sort of return policy do you
if you know another couple who looks exactly like you guys and who want two dozen commuter mugs a wall hanging and a shield
then his cellphone rings
he angrily answers it without looking at the caller id
we hear someone yelling at him
alans eyes bulge
oh hey becky
he steps away to take the call
vick explains to carla thats his girlfriend of years
im sure thisll only take a minute
vick and stu go back to looking at the wedding photos as alan tries to talk to his furious girlfriend
in her laura ashley bedroom angrily packing up her suitcase
shes beautiful and preppy in pearls and a sweater set
can you tell me why all the goddamn credit cards are maxed out
i i have no idea
then vick calls over from the white plastic table pissed alan waves at them shut the hell up
but becky has heard
your best man
whats going on there alan
baby nothing the guys alan furiously flips them off shut up
i really dont appreciate being mocked right now alan especially about wedding related issues
you know how hard this weekend is going to be for me
i know baby
so youll call the credit card company and straighten this out
beat calming look sorry im so tense
ill see you soon okay
but alan is just staring at the bronze shield of him making out with his blonde bombshell wife
i said i love you
yes no i love you too
becky hangs up rolling her eyes unbelievable
stay with alan as he closes his cellphone
hey hows becky doing man
yeah did she ask about us
off of alans hate filled glare we through the strip mall parking lot back to their car
alan sullenly carries the giant bronze shield
look on the bright side alan
vick found a great clue
turns out doug was in all the wedding photos which means if the time stamp was right we had him in our possession until pm
thats another hour of last night that we can account for
isnt that great
bitterly sarcastic amazing
hey steve you dont happen to know where we were heading when we left here last night do you
well the double camelot package comes with a five course wedding feast so i assume you went there
great where was the feast
sbarro over in the fremont mall
i paid grand for sbarro
the beatup caddy is packed with wedding crap
vick is busy trying to reverse the overloaded car out of the parking spot
stus in the backseat with the huge shield while alan seethes up front
your negativity is like a little black cloud over our car alan
youve got to let go of this
let go of what exactly vick
the fact that i married a complete stranger last night
or that my girlfriends about to leave me
or that im broke
i thought you were
i know you think its like terminally uncool to be in a committed relationship vick but i actually love becky okay
i i honestly dont know what id do without her
i really dont
alan looks off lost sick
vick stops the car short
have you considered even for a second that maybe the things we do when were drunk are what we secretly want to do
dripping with sarcasm yeah no youre absolutely right vick ive always secretly wanted to marry a bottle blonde with big fake melon tits named chastity
i aint mad atcha dude
or after years maybe you dont have the balls to leave becky and this is your way of getting her to leave you
i was going to propose to her this weekend you jackass
all the more reason to freak out
alan opens his mouth to respond but nothing comes out
vick nods chew on that and continues slowly reversing the car
i love you alan mervish i do but youve always had a major pole up your ass
maybe last night was your inner cool person trying to get out i swear to god vick if you say one more word to me i will destroy you
guys come on lets not use our angry words a baseball bat shatters the windshield
the guys all jump
vick slams on the brakes
they look up to see two massive samoan men in loud hawaiian shirts kalolo fanalua and kikiolani s standing on either side of the car
and they look pissed
get out of the car vick
stu and alan recoil in terror
who are these guys
to kalolo fanalua i think theres been some sort of mistake mister
shut the hell up and get the hell outta the car and this is my associate mr
smash you in the teeth if you say another word
beat to alan those so arent their real names
vick dont be a dick
these men arent going to hurt us
theyre from hawaii
kikiolani starts viciously smashing the car
were from guam bitch
now get outta the car
cool it with the bat
jesus why is everyone trying to kill my car
vick undoes his seatbelt and reaches for his door handle
kikiolani lowers his bat and vick throws the door open right into his nuts
the huge samoan staggers back owww and vick slams his door shut and the caddy sideswipes a car hops the curb and lands on the street
they squeal away the huge bronze shield flying out of the backseat as they do
it clatters on the pavement
vick drives like the wind trying to see around the huge spiderweb in the windshield
alan and stu are freaking out
whyd you do that
maybe they just wanted to talk
i honestly dont know how you two are still alive
do you think we stole something from them last night
oh my god i am such a bad dad
producing cellphone im calling the police
this is getting way out of control no
who are you fitty cent
yeah vick whats going on
i just think we should focus on finding doug and not get distracted by every little thing
every little thing
we were just assaulted by the yakuza
oh please those guys are from guam
get a grip
they knew your name vick
which means they probably know who stu and i are too
if anything ever happened to my family vick
lets just go back to the hotel doug is probably back from wherever he spent the night well get him well straighten out whatever we did to those angry samoans
then well get the hell back to la okay
vick angrily takes a harder than necessary left turn
alan hangs on tight almost flying out of the car
the boys hurry into their room stressed
alan quickly checks the room phone
come on lets toss the place
alan starts wading through the crap in the living room while vick and stu head off to check the bedrooms
stu brushes aside beer bottles and room service dishes looking for anything relevant
he spots a legal contract on the ground
picks it up
hey check it out vick
i invested grand in your custard store last night
vick calls from the other bedroom
smart move man
stu opens the closet door and freezes
hey you wanna come in here a sec
vick enters a moment later to find stu staring into the closet
vick follows his gaze and sees a sexy woman snoring away on the closet floor her blonde hair obscuring her face
you think shes what those guamian dudes wanted
i think shes alans wife
stu covers his mouth oh shit
vick produces the wallet sized photos from alans wedding compares them and nods
wanna step in here buddy
a second later alan enters whats up
alan looks down sees chastity snoring on the closet floor her body all contorted and freezes
oh my god
what am i supposed to do
wake her up man
because shes your spouse dude
scowling alan slowly crouches down
then a little scared he nudges her
he nudges her harder
pinch her tit
it always works
alan shakes her a bit harder and brrapppp the girl lets out a massive burp and awakens coughing
alan jumps back up terrified
the woman chastity looks around disoriented
dang did i sleep in the closet again
then she notices the guys staring down at her
she smiles recognizing them oh hey guys
she shakily climbs to her feet to expose a skimpy skirt a snug tube top and mascara smeared all over her face
the guys have no idea what to say
she kisses alan on the cheek very intimate like well a husband and wife
she exits into the living room picking her wedgie
alan is speechless
she seems really cool
yeah i really like her man
chastity gathers her belongings jacket purse g string from around the totalled living room
the guys file in
so um did you take alans name
yeah are you chastity mervish now
listen to me
did we or did we not have sex last night
alan braces please say no please say no
vick braces please say yes please say yes
alan slumps his life over
vick pumps his fist yes
but we waited til we were married
what a responsible upstanding young jew
they dont make em like that anymore am i right
chastity smiles sweet as she straps on her inch heels
i know he even wanted to use a rubber
alan breaks into a coughing fit
wait we didnt use a condom
its cool i sponge
alan leans against a wall dizzy
please open a window
stu turns and tries to open a window
they dont open
so you guys dont remember any of last night
yeah not so much
hey been there before right
grabbing her sizable bra sucks though
the wedding was really fun
im bummed you dont remember it alan
she smiles a little saddened
stu whispers to alan dude i think your wifes mad at you
you dont happen to remember what time we met you last night do you
sure we met at the bar at like
then we got married on my smoke break which was like
its the all american love story isnt it
what happened next
well i had to go back to work
but when i got off at i met up with you guys back here
and was doug with us then
do you have any idea where we went after the wedding
no but i bet some of my work friends do
you were partying with them pretty hard
dozens of em dancing grinding shimmying on poles
chastity leads the guys through vegass most notorious strip club the crazy horse
its bacchanalia writ large complete with throbbing music flashing strobe lights and six stages of spinning flesh
the place is mobbed with patrons
alan follows after chastity horrified
you work here
behind him vick slaps five with stu psyched
yeah and this is the pole where we first met
she stops at a pole around which a brunette stripper currently spins
alan looks ill
its always been my lucky pole
look i dont know how to tell you this but she holds up her hand showing off alans grandmothers ring to the stripper currently upside down on the pole
get it girl
come on lets go meet my bridesmaids
she hurries off but alan cant move
the holocaust man
alan just stares into space
vick takes him by the shoulder
look we can get your grandmothers ring back
we just gotta go about it in the right way
i have besmirched my people
dont be so hard on yourself dude just then chastity runs back over with two blonde strippers
these were my bridesmaids anastasia and starr
good to see you again
just then a spotlight finds chastity and alan and the sleazy ponytailed dj up in the booth comes over the p
system the entire club cheers
chastity holds up her wedding ring and dances around woo hoo
alan waves meekly
the dj puts on nine inch nails i want to fuck you like an animal and the club gets hopping again
oh my god hes playing our song
giddy to alan this song was playing when we met remember
you kept sliding twenties into my thong and saying i will always love you
i will always love you
alan closes his eyes
yeah it was so sweet
look i dont know how to say this but my friends and i were very drunk last night
we would never come to a place like this he glances over at vick and stu but theyre gone
and downing them
pull back to see that they are sitting in getting lapdances from starr and anastasia
the champagne room is a dark plush private suite in the back of the crazy horse where strippers ply their craft the room is half full
vick watches starr lean over and make out with anastasia
you are the best bridesmaids ever
huge boobs in his face dude i might not be gay
then alan hurries in with chastity he looks pissed
what the hell are you doing
two for ones man
we dont have time for this
we gotta find doug
what do you think were doing
were getting into the mindset of last night to see if it sparks any memories
to his stripper now is this exactly how you were dancing for me last night starr
vick nods pensive scientific
yeah still no memories
keep going and put your back into it
you are so goddamn selfish vick
you really are
stu lets go
stu sit and enjoy your dance
stu looks between them torn
dude doug is missing
we have less than hours til his wedding
we do not have time for this
im trying to save your life here alan mervish
im not kidding man
life is one long series of emergencies and if you dont learn to stop and have a little fun along the way youre gonna grow into a joyless old prick
like your dad
im sorry to bring moshe mervish into it but it had to be said
now yes we have hours to find doug which means we can afford to spend ten minutes celebrating the special talents of these gifted young body artists
so sit down have a jager shot and smell the goddamn roses for once in your miserable life
when youre ready
chastity pushes alan onto the red leather banquette and starts dancing for him
he tries to squirm away no look i am like totally against this morally and politically
plus becky specifically asked me not to as chastity works a wildly erotic lapdance on him
she crawls onto his lap she whips him with her long hair she puts her tongue in his ear
next to him no longer getting lapdances vick and stu just sit staring at chastity entranced
i think i know why he married her
because if he hadnt i wouldve
they continue watching on in silence
is it weird that were sitting this close watching
not for me
more watching in silence
i really shouldnt be here
i have daughters
then both of their heads angle the same way
not that can do that
how can she do that without dislocating her hip
because shes been touched by god
they continue staring amazed
just then the door is kicked open and kikiolani and kalolo fanalua burst into the champagne room peering through the darkness looking for our guys
vick and stu see them immediately
they both hop up
alan remains sitting however hypnotized by chastity
vick grabs him
alan come on man we gotta go
whoa whoa im smelling the roses vick literally yanks alan up from the banquette
come on man
we got company
finally the guamians spot the guys and lumber for them
chastity honey is there a back way out of here
thinking fast chastity grabs her clothes and darts over to a darkened unlabeled fire door
the guys race after her
chastity and the guys sprint through the bright crowded back hallways of the crazy horse weaving through strippers cocktail waitresses and barbacks
behind them the two massive samoans try to follow but are slowed by all the foot traffic
strippers scream as theyre bowled over by the obese islanders
a spotlight holds on a closed curtain covering the main stage
some sort of techno limp bizkit song is playing
all the patrons turn their attention to stage one then stu blows through the curtain out of breath
the patrons look at stu confused
stu looks at them equally so
the patrons start to booo just as vick chastity and alan blow through the curtain after stu
chastity in six inch leucite heels sprints down the main runway leaps over the patrons sitting at the end and hits the floor running
did she just do that in heels
im really starting to like this girl
the guys all follow suit sprinting down the runway and leaping over the patrons
then the guamians blow through the curtain panting very upset
they lumber down the stage and the patrons at the end of the runway clear the hell out of the way
upsetting cocktails hopping onto stages and then off again leaping over chairs spinning around stripper poles and finally sprinting out the front door
the massive guamians give chase leaving a wide trail of destruction behind them like two elephants trampling through a forest
just as theyre blowing out of the door however being swung into their chests
they both stumble backwards and then four roided up strip club security guards pounce on them wrestling them to the ground
to walkie talkie viper one this is rolling thunder weve subdued the targets over
chastity and the guys hurry around the corner from the crazy horse laughing exhilarated from the chase
did you see them trample those tiny japanese businessmen
i think they killed like four of them
vick puts his arm around alan
come on alan tell me that wasnt just a little fun
a little fun
vick smiles just as a las vegas police car hops the curb lights flashing and cuts them off
two mustachioed cops get out and hurry for them pointing intense
youre coming with us
the two lvpd cops officer merriweather and officer bladen s pace about this bare interrogation room while vick alan and stu sit behind the cold metal table
vick looks tense but in control
stu and alan are sweating terrified
theyve clearly been here a while
where were you last night at am
okay how about at am
officer bladen slams the table with his fist
you think this is cute son
you think this is a game
whatever we did were so sorry
honestly man i will confess to anything you want
stu stop talking
alan sit up straight
officer merriweather ive told you twelve times now we have no memory of last night
now either charge us with a crime or let us go
merriweather scowls and nods at bladen who steps over to a television and turns it on
merriweather meanwhile pulls out a photograph of a slick asian man in a red suit slides it onto the table
what do you know about jimmy lang
vick flinches ever so slightly clearly knowing something
stu and alan just look at the photograph confused
who is he
jimmy lang runs the infamous shiang xi crime organization and is wanted in seven states for money laundering drug smuggling racketeering and murder
oh my god did we kill someone last night
we have no idea who this man is
is that right
yeah thats right
on the television grainy surveillance camera footage of a birthday party starts playing
in the video jimmy lang sits in an upscale restaurant in front of a birthday cake as a table full of hip asian guys serenade him with happy birthday to
when the guys sitting next to jimmy lean forward to help him blow out the candles on his cake however we see that its vick alan stu doug and some
black guy all very drunk
vick drunkenly hugs jimmy lang
i love you jimmy lang
merriweather freezes frame on vick kissing the top of jimmy langs shaved head
in the interrogation room vick stu and alan sit frozen
were in a lot of trouble arent we
officers i swear we have no memory of that ever occurring okay
maybe a night in jail will jostle something loose
oh no sir please dont
we have a very important wedding
i know jimmy lang
everyone stops looks at vick
jimmy and i tried to raise capital for girl nasium a hour fitness center and day spa for tween age girls but it never got off the ground
it was an entirely legitimate enterprise i had no idea he was a criminal
we mustve bumped into him last night and he mustve invited us to join his birthday celebration
no crime in that is there officers
merriweather gets in vicks face intense
you actually expect me to believe that dung
yes officer merriweather
if i find out youre lying to me son i will take all of you down is that clear
you boys wouldnt last three hours in prison
stu shakes his head unbelievable
now are you gonna charge us with something or are we free to go
the cops look at each other scowling
get outta here
stu and alan quickly hop to their feet and make for the door
oh thank you officers
it was really nice meeting you
if you know whats good for you youll get the hell out of vegas
day has turned to night
vick stu and alan descend the steps of the police station
the mood is grim
did you have to be such a dick
we got out didnt we
yeah four hours later
if wed just cooperated with them if wed cooperated with them wed be in jail right now alan
they reach the curb and stu starts trying to hail a cab
desperation is setting in
what are we gonna do now
weve got zero leads on where doug is
why hasnt he called
the guys shake their heads i dont know
do you think hes okay
doug is fine
i mean we were hanging out with mobsters last night man
they kill people for looking at em weird
stu doug is fine
or what if we like drove doug out to the desert and left him just as like a funny prank
i knew i shouldnt have come
what did you just say
i said i knew i shouldnt have come this weekend vick
getting heated is that right
yeah thats right
i only came because doug insisted
vick steps towards alan heated
why do think youre so much better than us dude
i dont i just think im better than you vick
and trust me its not that hard
you havent changed one bit since high school
jesus youre years old and you still talk back to cops
youre out of your depth alan and youre still the one getting us in trouble
only then it was hiding your weed in our locker and now youve got us partying with wanted felons
its not cute anymore man
were too old for this
vick scowls this is actually hitting home
and all your stupid get rich quick schemes
in los angeles
are you joking
okay lets all take a breath whens the last time you had a real job man
whens the last time you had a girlfriend
hell whens the last time you picked up the check
whats so great about any of those things
those things vick are what grown men do
vick swallows furious
look were all tired and hungry
none of us ever liked you alan
we only hung out with you because doug made us
alan recoils whoa stung
this is clearly news to him
is that true
stu gestures uncomfortable enh whos to say
alan nods i see his face reddening
why would anyone like you dude
have you ever thought about that
youre uptight youre judgemental youre cheap and yet somehow you think youre sweeter than everyone else
well look around man no one wants to be you
id rather be stu than you
too late alan charges vick and tackles him onto the lawn
they roll on the ground trying to punch each other but it ends up being a mess of half chops pulled hair and hands in each others faces
you punch like
stu runs over and jumps in trying to break them apart
we all need a time out
stu is accidentally kicked in the face and goes down
alan and vick continue rolling on the lawn trying to beat the crap out of each other
they could be kids again
then just when it starts getting way too intense and all three of them look up to see vicks beat up cadillac parked on the curb chastity at the wheel
that might not be like the smartest place to fight
vick and alan look over at the huge las vegas police department sign right next to them
vicks car sits parked in front of a country bar
the guys sit at a booth their hair a mess their faces bruised their clothing ripped ravenously chowing down on tacos
stus mouth is full of food good call on happy hour chastity
these tacos kick ass
yeah i always come here when i get out of jail
the guys exchange a quick look
hey howd you start vicks car
oh my daddy taught me how to hotwire almost anything
thats funny because alans daddy taught him tax law
chastity smiles a little confused
alan is quick to retort and vicks daddy taught him how to get really drunk at his kids soccer games and then piss himself
its a disease dude
guys come on
alan and vick angrily continue eating their tacos
then stus phone rings
he pulls it out reads the caller id
dont answer it
what if its doug
what if its tracy
torn answers phone good evening this is stu
shes sitting in her living room on the phone
her stern father sits nearby as do other family members
stu its tracy
his eyes bulging stu covers the phone and hisses its tracy
vick glares at alan
alan looks away shit
why is she calling me
because she knows youre the most easily tricked
we have tell her we lost doug
no we dont

stu turns back to the phone rattled
w whats going on
oh nothing just here with my family
wow that sounds amazing
hey you wouldnt happen to know where doug is would you
he said hed be home by for this dinner and now its almost
i tried his cell but he didnt answer
covering the mouthpiece she wants to know where doug is

i asked if you knew where doug was
yeah um hang on
to guys she still wants to know
okay tell her alan got really drunk last night and fell down and the doctor said not to move him for a few hours but that well be back in

its a fictitious canard alan get over yourself
stu tell her

h he was drunk
and the doctor a different doctor not the one he fell on he said we couldnt move him until the wedding for a few hours
well be home before the wedding
but were going to have the wedding at your home tracy just looks really confused
exasperated vick rips the phone away from stu
how are ya hon
now very concerned vick what is going on
stu is a moron
listen alan hurt his back last night so were gonna be laid up here for a bit but i promise well have doug home in time for the wedding okay
oh god is alan all right

alan flips him the bird

no you cant actually doug
doug is out
where is he
where is he
yeah picking up alans medications
listen trace im losing you but well see you tomorrow okay
vick hangs up and nods confidently
she bought it
back in her bungalow tracy hangs up the phone frowning
theyve done something stupid
her stern father is standing there frowning
no surprise there
im just saying what kind of man stands up his fiancee the night before their wedding
dad i dont want to hear it
i trust doug absolutely
turner backs off
tracy however looks a bit rattled
the guys get up from the booth and head for the door grim
we just told tracy wed have doug home in hours and we still have no idea where he is
they pass a doorman on their way out whos standing with a stamp and a uv light reader
handstamp for re entry
handstamp for re entry
everyone waves no thanks except for stu who shrugs why not and stops holding out his hand
maybe we should go back to the hotel and oh my god guys
stu holds his hand under the uv light its covered in stamps from all the clubs theyve been to the night before
stu yanks up his sleeve to reveal his entire forearm glows completely covered with stamps
the guys hurry back and slide their forearms under the uv light too they all have the same stamps
their eyes alight its like a map of last night
the guys look at each other hope returning to their faces
the guys rocket down the strip weaving in and out of traffic
all the stamps on stus arm are now labelled in regular ink
music blares and the mood is high
where do you want to start
at the top
we hit every club we went to til someone remembers what we did with doug
nice clue stuey
i cant believe were actually gonna pull this off
stu grins over at the car next to them
then he stops
hey is that guy wearing dougs hat
the guys look over to see that the driver of the next car over is in fact wearing the distinctive fedora style hat doug was wearing last night
the guy turns off the strip
naaah couldnt be
lots of people have hats like that
stu nods yeah i guess
the first bar written on it is ghostbar
chastity and the guys blow in each with a photo of doug in medieval armor from alans wedding
as they move into the club every single waiter bartender and busboy sees them and throws open their arms heyyyy remembering them
they flash the picture of doug to anyone wholl look waiters maitre ds thugs bachelorettes fetishists bikers swingers brides and grooms but all of them shake their heads we have
no idea where doug is
stu crosses off ghostbar from his arm
the guys and chastity enter and disperse
again everyone recognizes them and hugs them like returning heroes and again no one remembers where they were taking doug
stu crosses off another stamp from his arm
the bouncer recognizes the guys from the night before and unclips the rope letting them in past the immense line
the bouncer recognizes the guys from the night before and unclips the rope letting them in past the immense line
the bouncer recognizes the guys from the night before and unclips the rope letting them in past the immense line
the guys race through a shadier more industrial area of town their hopes dimming
all right this is the last place we went chaps
vick rolls to a stop in front of
it takes a moment for the guys to realize that everyone in line is male buff and wearing erotic cowboy gear
you sure we came here
then they look up at the marquee
it reads chaps home of the golden pony
maybe ill just wait in the car but vick is already shoving stu out of the car
the guys walk into the massive nightclub and stop
its got a kitschy barn theme and hosts topless dudes in cowboy hats and short shorts grinding on each other
you think we wouldve remembered this
yeah i dont think we came here
then why is your underwear nailed to the wall
the guys turn to see numerous pairs of mens underwear nailed to the wall nearby
a sign above it reads chaps wall of fame
we recognize stus colorado state boxers
those could be anybodys
thousands of people go to colorado state looking more closely oh my god are they autographed
realizing stunned i am so gay
just then a buff waiter in assless chaps blows by smiling
roger is backstage
the guys look at each other eyes wide
the guys move through the throng of undulating sweaty men uncomfortable
alan takes chastitys hand tightly
stay very close to me
she smiles and dances through the crowd
they reach a huge male bouncer guarding the backstage area
he sees the guys and unclips the velvet rope kissing each of them on the cheek as they pass
how are haylee and kaitlin
totally disturbed oh
g good thanks
the guys reach the dressing room door and stop
were going to love you either way stu
stu nods focussed nervous like before a big game
some of my best friends are gay
is that true
i live in connecticut man we dont even have black people yet
stu nods right
then after steeling himself he enters
the dressing room is packed with muscular tan buck naked men walking around rubbing baby oil on themselves donning chaps and codpieces getting ready for the next show
chastity and the guys move through the mob of beefcake staying ridiculously close together
vick stops at one dancer trying not to look down at his junk excuse me friend can you tell me where roger is
oh hey vick
rogers over there
he points to a really hot really naked guy with a funky mullet stretching out in front of his mirror
the guys shuffle over to him
vick tries to be supportive with stu hes cute
stu shrugs yeah i guess
as they draw close roger sees them and smiles
he hugs all of them
the guys make sure to keep their asses arched back to avoid genital contact
im surprised youre even walking yet stu
inhaling sharply oh my god
listen man we dont really remember what happened last night can you fill us in
stu shakes his head wide eyed scared
well i must say stu im a little hurt
the guys all freeze
then vick pats stus shoulder supportive
the boy or the girl
oh honey you were everything
vick and alan exchange a look holy shit
but you were nothing like vick
i know im sort of over group stuff too but alan insisted
now its alans turn to look stunned
whyd you insist
i dont know
i dont know why i insisted
actually after the anger went away it was really quite tender
the guys look at each other nauseous
im really not sure we can be friends anymore
finally chastity starts laughing
guys hes kidding
roger breaks into a smile and slaps five with chastity
the guys all exhale incredibly relieved
not cool roger
so what did happen last night
oh well you guys came in near the end of our last set like ish
doug pretty much dragged you in
oh no my doug not your doug
black guy shaved head
the guys look at each other confused
hes a cake designer he said he met you guys at some sort of birthday party at the rio
snapping his finger the guy from the jimmy lang surveillance video
the guys nod right
anyway for the big finale of our show we always bring someone on stage and well stu you volunteered pretty aggressively
to nearby dancer hey dallas do we have the video of last nights show
thats cool i dont need to see it we must see that video
its in the machine
roger nods and presses play on a little vcr tv combo sitting in front of his mirror
on the tv a very brokeback chippendales style male revue starts playing
roger fast forwards
you were pretty mellow at first stu but once we got you into the chaps you really came alive oh here it is
on the tv we see stu wearing only his i roger g string and assless chaps grinding on stage with the golden pony dancers
he is way fatter paler and hairier than the greased young studs
the guys look away oooo
im a dad i i dont get to the gym as much as id like
you even taught us the pony which wed never even heard of before
on the tv stu gets on all fours on the stage and eagerly gestures for the dancers to take turns riding him
stus face drops
and then of course the piece de resistance the ride of the valkyries
on the video stu clutches onto roger from behind as they ride a lavender mechanical bull together
the crowd goes wild
annnnd that would explain the searing ass pain
after the show we split a couple pitchers of flirtinis you had our stylist cut your hair like mine and then you split
and what time was all this
in the morning
and our doug was with us
yeah he had passed out by then but you carried him out
it was all very officer and a gentleman
the guys look at each other confused
wait so we left with doug at we got back to the hotel at and doug was gone by when chastity met back up with us
that doesnt make any sense
did we lose him along the way
he was passed out how far could he have gone
just then vicks cellphone rings
the caller id reads mandalay bay
he answers hello
atashir is on the phone at the reception desk
atashir many greetings to you
i thought you might like to know that one of our maids just found your friend douglas passed out in your room
vicks jaw drops
are you sure its him
i saw him with my own eyes
he is unconscious but breathing nicely
oh thank you atashir
you are a man of great honor
a thousand blessings upon your ancestors
vick slams his phone shut overjoyed
doug is in the room
a maid just found him
hes passed out but hes okay
theyre sure its him
atashir swears it is
the guys all laugh a massive weight lifted
oh thank god hes okay
after all this
hes in the room
they keep laughing and hug each other heartfelt
vick even hugs roger
i dont even care
hug me you big shiny homosexual
chastity and the guys bound out of chaps jubilant
stu is carrying a box of two dozen videotapes
that was cool of roger to give you all the tapes of your performance
i know if i actually was gay id totally date roger first
what a gentle soul
they get into vicks clunker
how we doing on time
looking at watch

they drive off into the night grins all around
vick drives stu sits shotgun
alan sits in the back with chastity
the cool night air washes over them
they look happily exhausted
this has officially been the craziest weekend of my life

chastity tries to stymie her laugh

lamborghinis ferraris and hummer limos clog the valet stand
vick rolls up in his clunker
the guys hop out

chastity and the guys hurry down the hallway to their suite
vick unlocks their door and pushes inside
wake up man
instead of finding doug however they find kalolo fanalua sitting on their couch pissed
hes got a huge white cast on his right arm courtesy of the strip club bouncers
the guys freeze
the door slams behind them and they whip around to see kikiolani standing in front of the door blocking their exit
he has an identical cast on his right arm
just then a toilet flushes and an immensely large man in a red suit exits the bathroom drying his hands
we recognize him from his police photo as crime boss jimmy lang s
good to see you again
where is doug
lang whatever we did last night we are incredibly sorry these your rich friends you were telling me about vick
alan and stu glance at vick confused
oh you havent told them yet
really thats low
even for you
whats going on vick
vick stammers trying to find the words
six months ago your friend vick borrowed some money from me at what can only be described as a very unfavorable interest rate
when the loan came due he failed to pay me back but he promised me that he could get the money from you guys this weekend
alan and stu look at vick shocked and hurt
how could you do this to us man
were your best friends
vick looks away ashamed
they were gonna hurt me man
well vick it looks like you and your friends have some issues to discuss
in the meantime
he draws a huge red plated
i need my goddamn money
the guys jump back whoa
vick holds up his hands i can get it
i just ive heard that before vick including last night when you so rudely skipped out on my birthday party
thats why ive taken some collateral to ensure your payment
his name is doug
the guys all look sick
you have doug
oh my god
if you want your friend to live meet me at mile marker off highway at dawn and bring the money
are we clear
jimmy nods and heads for the door
the samoans follow him
m m mr
h how much does vick owe
alan and stu pace about the suite beyond stressed
vick stands looking out the window
chastity gets them all water
how the hell could you blow that kind of money
was it for the custard store
jesus stu wake up
there is no custard store
vick was just trying to rip us off to pay back jimmy lang
is that true vick
vick just stares out at the city not denying it
were any of your deals
stu drops onto the couch deeply disillusioned
dude i manage an applebees that money meant something to me
vick spins around furious do you really think i wanted my life to turn out like this stu
do you really think i dont know that im a massive loser
jesus you guys got out of high school and you just knew what to do you went to college and got good jobs and found cool wives and made beautiful
children what do i have to show for the last decade of my life
vick swats a lamp off a nearby end table it smashes against the wall
the guys freeze
vick grows emotional
jesus im almost and the only thing i really have
the only thing i really have is you guys
come on vick no man its true
i put on a good show but my life is so goddamn hollow and vapid and lonely it scares me man
i i dont know how much longer i can keep this scam going
and now ive gone and ruined the one good thing i had
tears threaten in his eyes
he wipes at them angry
please dont give up on me okay
i i dont know what id do without you guys
i really dont
alan and stu exchange a look
theyve never seen brash cocky vick this vulnerable before
stu cant help but give in
come on man weve been bros since third grade its gonna take a lot more than money to ruin our friendship
vick looks down deeply touched
what i dont understand is why you didnt just ask me for the money
i wouldve given you every last cent i had man
tears trail down vicks cheeks
he crosses and gives stu a hug
stu hugs back emotional
i love you man
love you too bro
love you too
they hug tight
for a while
also i banged your sister sophomore year
vick pulls away
just seemed like a good time to tell you
vick stammers at stu speechless
she had just broken up with that guy from central we were playing i never at tim donahees pool one thing lead to another no
vick desperately tries to clear the image from his mind
alan just frowns at his watch stressed
look im glad were all sharing but weve got three hours to come up with grand or else
the guys nod frowning back on point
id offer to take a loan out but its oclock in the morning im pretty sure my bank is closed
i think i can get a grand cash advance on my credit card
so that just leaves grand
the guys frown at each other
well it is vegas
the guys eyebrows all rise you think
the guys erupt in cheers around him yaaa
the dealer slides over a large pile of chips
again the guys erupt
alan hugs chastity
their pile of chips grows
the guys jump up slapping ten yelling
stu points at a table full of old ladies nearby in your face
then they take their large stack of chips and quietly leave
no one knows how to play pai gow poker
having just won
chastity and the guys aggressively hug him
stu drinks from his glass hands shaking wired
looking at watch minutes
alan quickly counts the chips
come on chip check
dude how many red bulls have you had
i stopped counting at six
i can hear my heart beating in my head
alan finishes counting the chips and frowns
just over grand
the guys wince damn
theres only one thing left to do
they all exchange a knowing look
at a roulette table
the guys sweat tense
stu is insane
you sure we dont want red
what if the ball lands on red
shut up stu
betting is closed
the croupier drops the ball into the wheel
it bounces hops spins
vick crosses himself
stu looks away
i cant watch
my hearts gonna explode
can your heart even explode
because i think my heart is gonna explode
i cant watch
the ball lands
its red isnt it
i knew it
tell me its not red
its not red
stu turns ecstatic its green
the ball has stopped on green double zero
stu clutches his chest like hes having a seizure
vick inhales grim
alan slowly drops to his knees
chastity closes her eyes
their huge pile of chips is raked off the table
the guys pack their bags into vicks beat up caddy
the mood is as dark as the pre dawn sky
when the car is loaded chastity takes alans hands gentle
would you like me to come with
it might get a little dangerous
i wouldnt want
he trails off
im so sorry
thanks for all your help
the cold desert wind blows
theres no sense
in exchanging numbers or anything
yeah probably not
alan looks genuinely sad
ill always remember you as a great first husband then
they both smile weakly
you can just send the divorce papers to the crazy horse or whatever
alan nods okay
another awkward pause
thanks for reminding me that there are still some really good guys out there alan
i dont get to meet too many of them
she smiles a bit sadly kisses him on the cheek and walks off
tight on alans grandmothers ring still on her finger
alan doesnt remember the ring however hes too busy watching her walk out of his life and feeling a real sense of loss
then vick fires up the car next to him
we gotta go man
alan nods yeah and gets in the car
vicks car races down a dark abandoned desert highway
the guys look tired stressed and most of all scared
yep just driving out to the middle of desert to meet some mobsters what could possibly go wrong
the guys all frown
so whats our plan
i think we should tell mr
lang that we couldnt get the money but that if hes amenable we could create a payment calendar
were gonna give jimmy a dummy bag of money grab doug and make a run for it
what an airtight plan
jimmy lang doesnt do payment calendars alan
trust me this is our only shot of getting doug back
vick skids onto highway a barely labelled dirt road
things are quickly going from bad to worse
streaking across venice beach
tracy exits her bedroom in her jammies looking like she barely slept
her father is up and making breakfast
any word from doug
i know you dont want to hear it trace but you deserve better
tracy frowns overwhelmed with stress
im sure everythings fine
theyre all smart capable adults
on top of his dirty clothing fruitlessly trying to create the appearance of a bag full of money
hes using some bills but also some s and s
this all the cash we got
the guys frown at their empty wallets yeah
we are the caddy is parked next to mile marker in the middle of the windy desert
the las vegas skyline is just barely visible in the distance
vick very delicately zips up his duffel bag so as not to disturb the bills and places it on his lap
this is the dumbest plan ever
alan i need you positive please
here they come
they all look up to see a white yukon approaching on the far horizon kicking up a trail of dust
the guys tense up
theres an emergency bottle of tequila in my glove box
get it out please
stu opens the glovebox pulls out a bottle of patron
he opens it takes a swig then passes it to vick who takes a pull and passes it to alan who also drinks
they all watch the white yukon draw ever closer
i cant believe this is how were going to die
the yukon pulls up about ten yards away
no one moves
the yukons doors open
the cadillacs doors open
tight on the jimmy langs red boot as it hits the road
tight on vicks leather shoe then alans sailing topsider then stus flip flop as they all hit the dusty road
the two parties stand by their respective cars facing off
somewhere in the desert a rattlesnake rattles
lets see the money
vick gently holds up his duffel bag
lets see doug
jimmy lang nods to kalolo who opens the back door of the yukon and pulls out a guy with his hands tied behind his back and a plastic ralphs bag
over his head he struggles a bit
the guys look a bit alarmed
jesus whatd they do to him
pull off the ralphs bag
jimmy yanks the bag off of the guys head to reveal its some black dude
vick stu and alan look confused
who the hell is that
this is doug
he pushes the guy forward
oh my god its the other doug
rogers friend the cake designer
to jimmy lang i told you man im doug howland
i barely even know these guys
yeah you got the wrong doug man
jimmy lang and the thugs look exasperated
yeah man our doug is white
but you were partying with this guy at my birthday thing
i dont know what to tell you bro this isnt the doug we requested
i apologize for the mix up
drawing his huge gun but im still gonna need my money
vick and the guys start backtracking towards their car
oh my god oh my god oh my god
dont move vick
vick freezes duffel in hand as stu and alan slink from view
jimmy reaches vick gun calmly trained at his head
give me my money
all eyes on vick anxiously clutching the bag in his hand
sweat beads on his brow
dont be stupid son
you then vick throws a hard left hook slamming jimmy square in his massive stomach
and jimmy is built like a tank
vick freezes oh shit
then jimmy pistol whips vick his lip explodes with blood and he falls to the ground
christ that hurts
then jimmy picks up the duffel bag
he goes to open the zipper when he hears jimmy looks up to see stu insanely charging him like the linebacker he once was
jimmy raises his gun but the gun flies free and they wrestle for it
the two guamians fumble for their guns but its difficult with huge casts on their shooting hands
he sees whats going down and his hands tied behind his back takes off sprinting towards vegas
alan looks around what should i do
what should i do
then he spots the keys in the ignition of the car
he hops in and fires up the engine
just then bullets pound into the cadillac
alan ducks down terrified and floors the gas
im being shot at
im being shot at
jimmy lang throws stu off of him and recovers his gun panting
he cocks it aims it at stu on the ground
i really didnt want to kill anyone then wham
alan drives the car into jimmy lang at mph
the obese mobster is pitched off his feet and lands a good ten yards away in a heap of dust
the guys freeze shocked
the guamians freeze shocked
oh my god is he okay
alan floors the car while stu and vick sprint and dive in
the caddy peels the hell out of there kicking up rocks and dust
the guamians fire after them
taking out the tail lights the windshield the headrests
the guys duck down til theyre sufficiently far away
then they sit up amazed out of breath
i cant believe you just saved my life
i cant believe you just drove my car into jimmy lang
alan drives his eyes as big as saucers
hes gonna be really upset
yeah i was just thinking that
the huge mobster lies face down on the desert floor
his two henchmen waddle up highly concerned
boss boss you okay
jimmy sputters into the dirt furious
and kill him
the guys race down the dusty highway in traumatized silence
now can we call tracy
vick frowns and blots his split lip with his sleeve
its probably time
the guys pull up at a lone dusty payphone in the middle of the desert
they all look at the phone
who wants to make the call
then vick reaches for his nose odd man out
stu and alan immediately reach for their noses too
that was you
i beat you by a mile
vick who won
i should do it
this weekend was mostly my fault
i need to man up
alan looks shocked and impressed by vicks newfound sense of responsibility
well ill be damned
vick grabs the bottle of patron takes a long swig
i still cant believe stu banged my sister
vick hands the bottle to alan gets out and makes for the pay phone
tracy is putting on her makeup in the bridal suite
her stern dad blows in
any word from doug
the way he spits out doug tells us all we need to know about how mr
turner feels about his future son in law
no but im sure hes just then tracys cell phone rings
she quickly answers it
in the desert on the pay phone looking through his busted aviators into the rising sun
tracy its vick
the bachelor party got a little out of control and well
we lost doug
her jaw dropping what
but were getting married in like four hours
yeah thats not gonna happen
alan starts to take a pull of patron when he freezes realizing something
on the phone with tracy being genuinely contrite
look im really sorry trace
this is all my fault
suddenly alan flies out of nowhere and snatches the receiver out of vicks hand
alan gets on the phone with tracy his heart racing
tracy its alan
hey vick is just joking around
weve got doug right here
vick looks like what
what kind of joke is that
i know vick is such a prick
well see you at the wedding
alan hangs up and races back to the car
what are you doing
i know where doug is
tracy stands in her bridal suite
then she just breaks down sobbing
her father hurries over concerned
alan floors the car back onto the towards vegas amped
remember when we saw dougs bed impaled on the griffin thing
yeah we threw it out the window
no the windows dont open remember
so how did
oh my god
i dont get it
and thats why weve been seeing dougs clothes all over vegas
he was trying to signal someone
i dont believe it
i i still dont get it and it totally jives with the timeline right
we brought doug back to the hotel at he was passed out
its so obvious
howd you figure it out
the patron man
it reminded me of our first drink of the night
honestly dude youre a genius
hes on the roof
stu looks confused the roof
after doug passed out we mustve taken him up there in his bed as a prank so hed wake up on the roof or whatever
then we forgot him
and all day hes been throwing his crap off the roof trying to signal someone to get him down
you think hes still up there
only one way to find out
the guys peel up to the valet and sprint out of the car
the guys race through the lobby at top speed
the guys burst out of the steel door onto the massive black tar roof
but doug is nowhere to be seen
the guys start to despair
stepping out from behind an air conditioning vent naked except for tighty whities his entire body bright pink from sunburn
and he looks furious
the guys run to him overjoyed
oh my god im so glad youre okay
before they can hug him though doug holds up his hand and whispers nasty parched dont
talk to me
the guys stop short
okay no thats cool
yeah you have every right to be upset
we validate your anger
the guys gingerly rush doug now in a mandalay bay bathrobe and clutching an arm full of bottled waters through the hotel lobby
alan is arguing into his cellphone
as they pass atashir at his desk vick yells over whyd you do it sweet atashir
why did you betray us
because they paid me
and also because youre kind of racist
see you next time you beautiful judas
they blow out of the hotel
where their beatup caddy is waiting
alan slams his cellphone shut frowning
no flights to la with empty seats
well we cant drive
its miles to la and the wedding starts at which is in
looking at watch three hours
then vick stu and alan exchange a look
a smile slowly creeps across their faces
vick is at the wheel leaning on the horn keeping the three doored caddy at miles per hour
when traffic gets thick he doesnt hesitate to drive in the shoulder
in the backseat doug chugs bottled water still simmering
look doug i think i speak for everyone in the car when i say im really sorry about locking you on the roof of the hotel
you gotta admit its a pretty funny prank
i mean up until the part when we forgot all about you
doug just stares out at the desert in stony silence
hes still not talking to us
totally understandable man
whenever youre ready
workers bustle about the grand lawn of the bel air bay club putting the last touches on the outdoor wedding site
its beautiful the royal palms the expansive views of the pacific the white chairs in perfect rows the altar adorned in roses
a harpist begins to warm up as well heeled guests filter in finding their seats
tracy checks her watch as a hairstylist works on her hair
then she checks her watch again
a garys tuxedo van speeds up alongside the caddy as they fly down the freeway
a very nervous teenager opens the vans sliding door and wind whipping his face throws a huge package over to alan who stands and catches it
vick nods at the van driver and shouts over the wind the driver gives vick a thumbs up and heads off
alan rips open the package inside are four tuxedos
the guys start taking off their tattered clothes
all the seats at the wedding are filled
everyone is there
except the groomsmen
or the groom
the harpist still plays though shes starting to look a little pissed
looking beautiful in her wedding gown tracy gazes out of the window at the perfect wedding arranged below
then she notices guests whispering is something wrong
wheres the groom
she turns away trying to hold it together
the guys now in their tuxes rocket down the freeway primping
alan brushes his teeth doug tries to comb his hair stu flosses and vick shaves with an electric razor as he weaves in and out of traffic
tracy paces in the bridal suite
im sorry honey but i think you need to seriously consider that doug might not be coming
tracy stops short speechless
some men just arent cut out for this kind of commitment
im so sorry that this is how you had to find out just then we hear a car squealing up outside
the bridesmaids sit around the posh lobby waiting anxious
just then the doors blow open and stride inside
their tuxes are wrinkled their hair is a mess and the groom is bright pink but theyre here
sorry mapquest took us a crazy route
we ready to do this thing
the bridesmaids sit up stunned
walking down the aisle arm in arm as mozart plays
tracy looks tentative
her father frowns not at all happy
everyone smiles ahhs and snaps photos
the groomsmen smile as well
vick whispers to doug she looks beautiful man
doug still doesnt speak to him
i get it
reaches the altar then turns to her dad
his face is a mess of emotions
i love you daddy
i love you too pumpkin
tracys dad shoots doug a nasty look before taking his seat in the first row
then tracy approaches doug at the altar and whispers to him angry hurt where were you
and why are you pink
its a long story
all i can say is im so sorry
and i promise for as long as were married i will never ever put you through something like this again
desperate pleading can
can you forgive me
tracy studies his face searching
all the guests wait with bated breath
the groomsmen wince come on come on come on
then unable to be mad at doug tracy smiles and kisses him
he kisses her back
the guests all sigh in relief
the groomsmen exhale whew
vick and alan covertly knock fists
the minister clears his throat
we um we traditionally wait til the end for the kiss
but doug and tracy just keep on kissing
at the reception
the entire wedding party is applauding
and the wedding band kicks in
we are now down on the lawn where white tables and a dance floor have been set up
vick stu and alan aggressively applaud and whistle for the bride and the groom
we did it fellahs
we pulled it off
i never had a doubt
alan smiles more relaxed than weve ever seen him
they sip champagne and watch doug and tracy enjoy their first dance on the dance floor
you think dougs ever going to talk to us again
give him time
like a decade or two then stu sees someone approaching over alans shoulder
the guys all look over to see alans girlfriend of years bearing down on them irate
shut up vick
alan where the hell have you been
ive been calling and calling
what you dont answer your phone anymore
alan shrinks down back to being the chastised boyfriend
i im so sorry i can explain then theres a womans voice behind them
they all turn to see standing behind them in a very sexy very elegant dress her hair back
she cleans up nicely
alan swallows whoa
this just got complicated
chastity smiles that he called her by her real name
i i know i wasnt invited but i just had to return this
she hands alan his grandmothers holocaust ring
becky watches on stunned
okay who the hell is this chick and why the hell does she have your grandmothers wedding ring
alan looks back and forth between becky and chastity
its the moment of truth
the fork in lifes road
talk you moron
jesus youre just like your mother
whos the ho wearing my ring
and in that moment it all becomes so clear
alan turns shes my wife
beckys jaw drops
chastity smiles slightly
stu and vick grin oh shit
we dont make each other happy anymore beck
and we can keep not making each other happy for another years hell maybe even another years but lets not
lets find people who make our hearts race
lets be excited and fun and alive again
alan looks at becky sincere honest

alan shakes his head sadly no
im sorry beck

chastity smiles takes his arm and they walk off together towards the bar
still married are we

she finally recovers enough to speak alan
alan steven mervish get back here this second
but alan keeps walking dont you walk away from me you stupid little clown
i own you

vick and stu wave him on go dude
then becky turns on them
they both scatter terrified
as he hurries off through the crowd
after a moment he daddy
stu turns to see his two angelic daughters in sundresses racing through the crowd towards him
they leap into his arms so excited to see him
he scoops them both up
oh i missed you guys so much
we missed you too daddy
youre the best dad ever
and then stu just starts bawling
his lovely wife erin appears harried a diaper bag over her shoulder and sees him crying
she rolls her eyes
jesus are you still drunk
stu shakes his head no and keeps sobbing as he pulls her into a big family hug
vick a cocktail in hand his tie undone heads into the mens room and approaches a urinal
then kikiolani and kalolo fanalua walk in behind him still in their huge arm casts still very pissed
vick inhales scared
okay okay ill go with you
dont ruin the wedding
then jimmy lang enters the bathroom on red crutches
i really didnt want it to end like this vick
vick nods resigned and starts towards him
then jimmy extends his hand for vick to shake
totally thrown um what
your friend alan just paid your marker
took out a second mortgage on his house
the full grand plus medical expenses which i thought was a classy touch
vick looks blown away
without our friends we are nothing vick
the three injured mobsters exit
vick remains standing there overwhelmed his life literally saved
standing on the cliffs overlooking the pacific drinks in hand as the wedding reception rages on behind them
i will pay you back you know
damn straight you will
they all laugh
okay so what the hell happened this weekend
the guys turn to see doug approaching smiling
they grin as he falls in with them looking out at the calm blue ocean
well alan married a stripper stu went gay and i learned a very important life lesson from an obese hoodlum
well tell you the whole story when you get back from your honeymoon
we really are sorry man
doug nods i know
vick raises his cocktail
to doug and tracy

the guys laugh

the guys all nod reassuringly
