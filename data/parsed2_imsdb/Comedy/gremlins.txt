written by chris columbus crowded
filled with oriental and british merchants
you can buy anything here
walks through the owd
an american businessman
he wears a tas eful g y suit
hes thin with distinguished good looks and thin brown hair
hes years old
rand looks around fascinated by the vast array of people and merchandise
he stops at a booth
a tiny oriental woman stands behind the counter
rand gives her a polite smile
im from out of town
on business from the u
the woman nods and smiles
he is very old
long white hair
a rotted smile
overhearing rand the man stops to eavesdrop
explaining to oriental woman im looking for a present
for my son
the woman nods
she searches through her wares
she holds up a basketball
rand shakes his head
hes not really involved in sports
the woman puts away the basketball
she picks up a sony walkman
rand again shakes his head
i want something unusual
something he cant get at home
reaches out and grabs rands arm
startled he turns
the oriental man stands before him
he stares into rands eyes
i can help you
he leads rand away from the booth
i offer something very different
rand is puzzled
the oriental leads him to a doorway
he opens the door motioning for rand to follow
rand pauses skeptical
take a look
it will cost you nothing
a beat you wont be disappointed
the oriental enters
rand shrugs and follows
rand follows the man up a narrow dark set of stairs
at the top they enter a room
filled with cardboard boxes and wooden crates
rand crinkles his nose
it su qlls bad in here
the oriental flips on a dim light bulb
he leads the nervous apprehensive rand to a dark corner of the room
the oriental picks up a small metal box
a high pitched giggle echoes from inside the box
rand is very puzzled
the oriental rests the box on a stack of crates
he opens the box
a tiny creature is inside
the animal is eleven inches tall and stands upright on two legs
it has two arms with small four fingered hands
its body is covered with fluffy brown fur
the piercing eyes are big sad
its ears are long and pointed
a tiny black nose sits above a wide mouth with small square teeth
the creature is smiling
it lets out a giggle
rand is delighted and surprised
hes never seen anything like this
the animal is more charming than a disney character
the oriental claps his hands
the creature leaps from the box onto rands shoulder
the animal licks rands cheek
he laughs amused by the creature
the oriental claps his hands again
the creature hops back into the box
it stares at rand with those cute green eyes
to the oriental what is it
it is called mogwai
a beat a very rare and intelligent animal
i found it in the fields near my home it will obey all orders
it learns fast
the oriental looks at mogwai and claps his hands
chinese english mogwai leaps to the ground
it scurries across the floor to a wooden crate
mogwai removes a raw tuna from the crate
it tears off a chunk of the fish and carries it to the oriental man
he takes the fish
mogwai hops back into the box
rand shakes his head
amazed by the animal
he oriental takes a bit from the raw fish
juice runs own his chin
he smiles at rand
and if you are ever in need of a song
he claps his hands to the creature
chinese english music
mogwai begins to hum in an unearthly falsetto
rand watches with wide eyes
he feels like a child again
one hundred american dollars
rand removes five twenties from his wallet
he gives them to the man
the oriental smiles and claps his hands
mogwai jumps onto rands shoulders
rand pets it
mogwai emits a cute giggle
it never sleeps
it will eat any thing
but prefers raw meat
it must always be kept indoors during the day
it lives in shadow
it hates bright light
direct sunlight will kill it
he takes mogwai from his shoulder and puts it into the box
rand puts the box under his arm
the oriental smiles your son will enjoy his new friend
rand smiles and exits
the oriental takes a bite from his raw fish
rand is on the pay telephon his baggage rests beside him
mogwai is inside of a small plastic pet box
the creatures bright eyes shine from inside
into the phone yes fred
the tai chan account is definite
my plane l eaves in twenty minutes
see you in pennsylvania
he hangs up
he picks up his bags and walks to the check in counter
tags mogwais box and puts it on the conveyer belt
rand watches the box disappear through the baggage chute
dont worry sir
your pet will be safe
the jet flies through the clouds
rand is eating his airline dinner

from the darkness of the book shelves

billy tries to ignore mogwais singing
it gets on his nerves
billy slams his hand on the desk top
he glares at the creature
mogwai stops singing
billy goes back to his writing
hops from the shelf
staying out of the direct light the creature moves across the desktop and cuddles up to billys arm
he jumps back

billy shines the bright
desk light into the creatures eyes
mogwai screams and jumps
off the desk to the floor
billy looks down at the creature

billy goes back to his work
mogwai is bored

billy is surprised
pete takes a step back
mogwai tenses up
the spots on its body that were hit with water begin to bubble
billy cant believe his eyes
mogwai writhes in pain
the spots on its body expand more getting bigger bigger
ready to explode
billy and pete stare
the spots burst
clones of mogwai
the spots on mogwais body bond together and disappear as if they were never there
there are now five identical creatures on the desktop
billy and pete share a shocked glance
billy grabs the water bottle
he has to be certain that he wasnt halucinating
he splashes a little more water on one of the new creatures
the process begins again
the creatures body contorts
a few lumps form
the lumps expand until
billy tries to make sense out of it all
eight creatures stand on
the desk top examining their new world
billy picks up his glass of milk
he splashes some milk on one of the crealtures
they must only multiply with plain tap water
thisais better than twilight zone pete looks at billy

pete grabs one of the creatures taking it from the group
it cries out
in a high piercing scream
the other creatures leap at pete
they grab the creature and bring it back to their group
maybe i wont take one
the creatures have moved to the brownies
they rip the brownies to pieces devouring them
rand sits in a chair opposite billy
the creatures climb all over rand
playfully tugging at his hair and
clothes licking his face
rand loves the adorable little things
billy has a worried look on his face

rand continues to play with the creatures
the bank has just closed

billy grabs the water bottle
billy squeezes a drop of water on one creature
mogwa lets out a scream
a lump appears on the creatures back
the lump gets bigger
roy watches with wide eyes

nine identical creatures now stand on the desk top

roy takes off his coat and opens his black leather case
billy exits with pete
how the grinch stole christmas plays

the creatures are drawn to water
if they sense water nearby
theyll go to it
a beat als unless th yre hunting for foo or water

they cried out
thats what happened when i tried to take one
if one is separated
the others will follow
they qant multiply by water if their environment temperature is below degrees a beat its amazing
they have no bio logical link with any other species of animal
in the whole world
billy gives an uncertain nod
distant sounds are heard
animal like noises
he sits up in bed
the sounds continue
he looks around the room
the creatures are gone
billy notices his room door
he gets out of bed
he looks at his sword hanging above the bed
he takes the sword from the wall
he walks out of the
sword in hand
the noises get louder
nervous billy descends the dark stairs
he arrives at the bottom
he stops to listen
the sounds are coming from the living room
he looks to the floor
beneath thechristmas tree
the creatures surround barney
they have killed the dog
billy tries to move
the creatures are eating the dog
they look up at billy
their bright green eyes are fiery
blood covers their mouths
the bag moves
the creatures are inside
rand carries the bag up a ladder that leads into the attic
lynn and billy stand a few feet away in the hallway
rand lets the creatures loose in the attic
he quickly latches the attics trap door securing it with a padlock
he climbs down the ladder
this should keep them out for the rest of the niht
the mogwai cluster around the trap door
they scratch at the door
they want out
tomorrow well take them out in the sun
finish them off
rand looks at billy
im sorry son
i never expected to
billy stares coldly at his father
embarrassed rand looks away
we should all get back to sleep
rand puts his arm around lynn
they walk to their bed room
billy looks up at the attic door
the creatures scratching is heard
the sun rises behind the house
snow is falling
the tr p door opens
billy and rand climb inside
they both carry flashlights
they s ine the lights through the attic looking for the creatu es
they see nothing
billy spots something
he nudges his father
there are nine individual pods stuck to various places on the floor
the pods are inches long inches in dia meter
they are wrapped with a vein like wire and covered with a thick syrupy glaze
what in the hell
billy picks up a broomstick andl pokes one of the things
hard as a rock
damn things are stuck to the floor
rand picks up a baseball bat
he raises it over his head and swings down hard
against the pod
the bat snaps in two
the pod is unblemished
rand rubs his stinging hands
billy and rand just look at each other
roy hanson sits with billy and rand
lynn pours them coffee
roy has just examined the pods
nd like a butterfly
those things in the attic are cocoons
the creatures are going through some sort of change
why did they attack my dog
they were hungry
aside from water food is their main concern
how long until they hatch
i really cant say
im not waiting around to find out
billy dont be hasty
youve stumbled onto a new life form
what comes out of those cocoons could be a major scientific discovery
i want them des troyed
hansons got a point
stern bitter dad they killed barney
or have you already forgotten
rand just looksat his son
lynn pops a valium in the background
red hot light
the flame of a torch
hes holding the gas torch aiming it at the cocoon
billy stands beside him

rand shuts off the torch
he touches the cocoon
it appears unharmed
not even warm
shakes his head theyre indestructible

she dips her butterknife into the large blender that has made the icing
the cocoons are bubbling furiously as if they were being baked in an oven
suddenly a crack appears on one
cracks begin to cover all the cocoons
green smoke seeps from the thin openings
a slow soft hiss is heard
roland stands beside billy
deagle patiently waits
whispers to billy apologize to the woman billy

tracy is proud
peltzer you are fired

green smoke has filled the room
the cocoons quiver
each one is covered with cracks
suddenly breaks out of one cocoon
it clutches at the air
breaks through the shell of another cocoon
they all begin to hatch
claws emerge from each one reaching for the air
slowly arranges the finished cookies on a tray
the door rattles
the lock shakes
the creatures want out
slowly moves to the kitch n doorway
the wood surrounding the lock begins to splinter
it finally snaps
the door pops open
the lock falls to the floor
a loud thump
jumps at the noise
scared she runs to the kitchen phone
billy puts on his coat preparing to leave
in the background mr

billy hurries to the phone
stands in the kitchen tightly holding the phone receiver
billy those things in the attic
i hear noises upstairs
his face goes white

he drops the phone and runs out of the bank
gary exchanges a puzzled glance with tracy
standing in the kitchen
she downs two valiums from her bottle
lynn exits the kitchen and slowly walks upstairs
behind the wheel of his car
he tries to drive fast but the heavy snowfall and icy roads prevent it
outside the sun is going down
shes arrived at the top of the stairs
its dark up here
she looks to the end of the hallway
lynn gets a chill
she slowly walks to the door
he tries to pass a slow truck
he hits a is spot
swerves and spins off the road
it lands in a ditch
the engine stops
tries to start it
he tries again
frustrated billy slams his fist on the steering wheel
a standing below the open attic door
she tightly clutches her valium bottle
she looks up
nothing but darkness
lynn pops another valium
she climbs theladder into the attic
he runs home through the snow
people have begun to turn on their christmas lights
billy runs harder
his house comes into view
at the e nd o f the block
lynn pokes her head inside looking around
everything looks fine
something leaps out and grabs lynn by the throat
we cant see it clearly
it moves too fast
it is hiddenby the shadows
other dark figures come at lynn
they want their share of the food
lynn watches in horror as the creatures surround her head
lynns body jumps and twists
her feet kick as she is pulled up into the attic
there are a few seconds of silence
then we hear the sounds
sprints down his driveway
he arrives at the porch of his home
he opens the front door
billy calls out before entering
scattered giggling echoes from inside
billy flips on thefront hall
a few tiny shadows scatter
they dash into other rooms
afraid of the light
he looks to the top of the stairs
billy climbs the stairs
at the top he quickly flips on the bright hall light
something darts up into the darkness of the attic
escap ing the light
billy spots the open attic door
he walks beneath it
he looks up into the dark attic
shaking voice mom

he jumps back
he looks at the object
stained with her blood
billy picks it up
a giggle from the attic
billy takes a few stepsback
he dashes into billy grabs the sword off his wall
he walks back
billy stands several feet from the open attic doo he clutches the sword
he takes a deep breath and flips out the hall light
a few seconds pass
leaps from the attic into the hallway
billy jumps back
mogwai snarls at him
mogwai has changed
it stands two feet tall
the brown fur is gone replaced by rock hard rippled armor
the arms and legs are muscular covered with the same armor
the paws have been replaced by claws
the fingernails are sharp
the tail is long and pointed
it thrashes back and forth
sharp white horns have replaced the ears
the green eyes are larger
a huge mouth distorts the face with its wide grin
the countless teeth are long and sharp
fresh blood drips from them
the giggle remains undercut with a hungry animalistic growl leaps at billy
billy raises his sword and swings
he hits the
creature in mid air
mogwai fal is to the gro nd

lynn is covered with bites and scratches
billy looks away
he notices the cocoons
sounds echo from downstairs
billys face goes white with fear
he dashes out of the attic
billy walks slowly
clutching his sword
ready for an attack
he descends the stairs
leaps from the overhead chandelier
it lands on billys back
the creature tries to bite billys neck
billy slams his blade nto mogwai
he whacks the creature
again and again
finally mogwai falls to the floor
billy brings down his blade
it slices mogwais head off
the creatures body quivers
billy moves to the living room
the fireplace burns
the christmas tree lights flash
flies at billy from across the room
a dinner plate smashes against the wall behind him
billy looks to the a creature sits on the middle shelf
it throws another plate at billy
he bats the plate away with his sword
mogwai continues to throw plates at him
billy dodges the plates making his way to the china cabinet
there he lunges forward with his sword
mogwai is stabbed
straight through the chest
the creature screams writhing in pain
it falls from the china shelf to the floor
billy slowly moves across the room
his eyes dart back and forth looking for creatures
he walks by the fireplace
three large red velvet stockings hang from the mantle
each one is inscribed with a name billy rand and lynn
pops out of each stocking
startled billy jumps back
the three creatures hop to the floor and move towards he clutches his sword
two creatures leap at him
he spears one in mid air
he quickly spins around knocking the other mogwai to the ground
he stabs the creature in the throat
he twists the sword until mogwai chokes to death on its own blood
the remaining creature attaches itself to billys leg
it takes a bite from his calf
billy cries out in pair
mogwai stays on
billy kicks his leg near the fireplace
scared of the firelight mogwai lets go
billy stabs the creature
he holds mogwai in the roaring flames of the fireplace
mogwai screams until it burns to a crisp
billy removes his steaming sword
the charred creature collapses into the flames
billy checks his leg
a small bite
he walks to the kitchen
its tiny lights flash
the camera moves closer to the tree
two larger green eyesazshine from inside the tree
the eyes of another creature
billy stands quietly
in the doorway
they dont notice billy
one has crawled into the large blender
it laps up the left over white icing
the other sits on the table
it nibbles on the santa cookies
billy looks at the bl
billy moves quickly
he dashes across the room and plugs in the blender
it starts witha loud whirr
the startled creature spins inside
mogwais screams die as it is chopped into a green mush
the remaining creature growls at billy
billy lunges forward with his sword
mogwai leaps out of the way onto the kitchen cabinet
billy turns to the creature
mogwai stands in front of the open microwave oven
billy pokes at the creature with his sword
mogwai takes a few steps back
billy still pokes at mogwai forcing the creature into the oven
billy quickly closes theoven door
mogwai is trapped inside
billy flips the oven switch to bake
the microwave purrs
inside mogwai screams and pounds against the glass door
soon the creature falls
its body quivers
like skin bubbles and pops
mogwai boils to death
bill wipes the swea from hs brow and exits the kitchen
he looks at the dead creatures
theyre all gone
billy rests his sword against the wall
he picks up the telephone and dials

a few feet away
against the wall

he quickly reels around slicing the other creature in two
both creatures lie in the snow

with two swings of his blade he kills the creature
billy wipes the green blood off his sword with his coat sleeve
breathless he looks at tracy
hangs in his eyes
blood runs down the side of his
sweaty unshaven face
his dark brown eyes stare at tracy

tracy sits beside him
she looks out the window
the rows of once peaceful cheerful homes are now the scenes of frenzied horror
people run out into the night screaming for help only to be dragged to the ground by creatures
ravaged bodies lie in the snow
an ambulance is overturned on the roadside

he sees the worn hollow faces of gary and tracy
he sees the bruised and bloodied billy

dorry bandages billys calf
gary sits with tracy on the sofa
billy finishes telling the full story to everyone

theyll be leaving town and heading for the water tower which means theyll have to pass by here tonight
a beat we have to get help
these things have to be kept under control
if they get to the water tower
they could spread all over the st ate
maybe the country
theyre like inhuman divining rods

arguing wont get us anywhere
gary still glares at billy

billy lunges at gary
they fall to the ground
dorry and tracy break it up

billy turns away
gary is comforted by tracy
but she keeps her eye on billy
dorry looks at everyone
we should get in touch with the authorities
yeah and then id like to try and get in touch with my dad
if we can
mogwais claw tears at the wires in the electrical box
garys cigarette lighter illuminates the room
everyone stays quiet
the giggling of several creatures echoes from outside
a frightened gary holds tracy
now what do we do
the giggling gets louder
billy turns to dorry
do you have a place without win dows
a place where we could be safe
dorry pauses to think
the storage room the sound of breaking glass is heard
clutching his sword we have to hurry
dorry leads everyone
out of the
dorry leads everyone inside
he closes and loks the door
he lights two cana es
well stay ere until daybreak
gary sits with tracy on an old sofa
dorry sits beside them in ani old rocking chair
billy pulls up an old woodenchair
they echo from offscreen
the creatures rummage through the antique store
listening to the sounds
mischevious little devils arent they
no one disagrees
tracy suddenly notices something
she cries out
pointing to the billy

he was going to surprise us
the coroner said that he lost his footing
he slipped and broke his neck
his body was lodged in the narrow chimney shaft
that how i found out there was no sahta claus
everyone has a chilled look on their faces
dorry just stares
billy stands and clears his throat
i think you should all try and get some sleep
a beat ill watch the door
billy moves his chair in front of the door
inhis rocking chair
gary stretches out on the sofa expecting tracy to cuddle with him
instead she walks over to billy
he looks at her
she gives him a comforting smile
i just wanted to say thanks
if it wasnt for you i dont know what any of us would have done
is it okay if i sleep here
on the floor beside you
id feel a lot safer
tracy moves a carpet next to billys chair
she lies on the carpet
she closes her eyes
gary watches from the sofa
dorry has fallen asleep in his chair
sword on his lap
he guards the door
sounds still echo from downstairas
throughout the antique store
the horror of it all finally hits him
his eyes fill with tears
sleeping in his chair
his hand still holds the sword on his lap
the others are asleep
billys hand quivers
the sword drops to the floor
he quickly grabs the sword
everyone else wakes from the sound
looking at their scared faces everythings okay
i just dropped my sword
gary rubs his eyes
what time is it
checks his pocket
he pushes the wood cabinet from the door the door is covered with scratches
billy slowly opens it
the room is bathed with light coming from a window facing the door
the light feels good
they exit the storage room
destroyed by lithe creatures
windows are broken
curtains are torn
billy dcrry gary and tracy enter
the four people through the house
into the kitchen the bedrooms the hallways
every room has been destroyed by the creatures
all of the antiques have been smashed or broken by the creatures
dorry is shocked to see his store in this state
billy walks to the front door
he tries to open it
he pulls hard
a blanket of snow
it snowed hard last night
three feets worth
see if we can get help
dorry walks back inside
gary flips on a transistor radio that has been sitting on the shelf
all major highways and roads are closed
driving is close to impossible
it looks like were gonna be snowbound for the holidays
i think we should get out
the nearest town is fifteen miles away
you wont get far
its wortha try
and what happens when it gets dark
and youre on the road
gary says nothing
we have to stick together and fight these things
at least until we can get help
tracy folds her arms
gary puts his arm around her
shed rather have billys
theres a mcdonalds about a block away
we get something to eat
a beat them we go to wjork
the police car is parked outside
many of the restaurant windows are broken
a few deserted cars are in the parking lot
the creatures have been here
the dead body of an old man is slumped across a table
a half eaten big mac is still in his hand
in a booth sits a dead family mother father boy and girl
their food still sits in front of them
a dead cashier girl lies on the counter
sit at a table in the rear of the restaurant
away from the grisly sights
they eat burgers and fries
gary takes a bite of his burger and nods to billy
not bad peltzer
i didnt know you could cook
could there be other people in town
but its more important to get at the creatures
weve got the advantage now
you know where they are peltzer
but theyre all gathered in one place
and the sun rose before they could make it to the water tower
so they must be holed up between here and there
the old church
shakes his head too many windows
too much light
its got to be someplace dark
how about somebodys garage
or tool shed
theres too many of them
theyd need a huge area
ridges movie house
everyone pauses to think
its a big place
billy nods to himself
thats the place
the sun is going down
walt disneys snow white and the seven dwarfs is playing
a written sign is posed in the box office window
billy and the others walk up to the theater
gary is carrying a flashlight
billy turns to him

what are you going to do if theyre inside

everyone seems puzzled
billy turns to gary
this place has some kind of boiler room
with a furnace
in the basement
to the others ill use the gas lines as a bomb
the fire will destroy the creatures
dorry looks at billy
i want to come in with you

theyll all go in together
weve got to stick together
and keep close to the flashlight
theyre scared of the light
gary turns on the flashlight
tracy takes billys hand
gary is jealous
they enter the theater
gary shines the flashlight
the candy counter has been smashed
all of the candy is gone
the popcorn machine is empty
the soda machine has been emptied and turned on its side
billy walks to the theater entrance door
he looks into the small window
countless pairs of green eyes shine in the darkness
the creatures murmur among themselves
billy whispers to the others
theyre inside the theater
the others peer into the window
to gary how do we get to the boiler room
theres too many of those things
theyll see us
if we could
just distract them
tracy perks up

billy tracy dorry and gary enter
tracy walks to the projector
she finds the forward switch
she flips it
the projector purrs
the lamp goes on
the reels turn
the second reel of snow white fills the screen
the seven dwarfs are singing hi ho hi ho its off to work we go
the song echoes through the theater
are frightened by the images on screen
the light hurts their eyes
but gradually they become interested in the movie
the creatures are clustered in their seats
fascinated by the animated screen billy and the others move through the darkness
they crawl on the floor on the outside aisle of the theater to the exit door
they move carefully
they make it to the exit
they crawl out
the creatures still watchthe movie

billy takes off his coat and shirt
he removes his t shirt
he looks at gary

gary reluctantly takes
off his t shirt
billy ties the two shirts together
he winds them into a cord
he finds a connection in the gas line
he begins to pound against it with the handle of his sword
sounds of metal ring out
the films reel ends
the screen goes blank
the creatures are puzzled
they throw their candy boxes and paper cups at the screen
the clang of billys sword hitting the pipe is heard
several of the creatures group together
they move from their seats to the exit door
they follow the sound
billy gives one final hit to
the gas line
the connection snaps
he stuffs the line with his and garys shirt
he turns the gas back on and lights the end of the crumpled
shirt with a match
the flame slowly creeps up the shirt to the line
we have to get out
gary points to a rear exit
that leads outside

he pulls out a gun and starts shooting
not your gun

gary stops shooting and fumbles for his flashlight
a creature leaps atdorry pinning the old man to the ground
other creatures attack dorry
billy picks up his sword and begins to knock the creatures off dorry
creatures come at tracy
she picks up a section of thick lead pipe and bats off the oncoming mogwai
gary finally turns on the flashlight beam
it keeps some of the mogwai at bay
fire creeps up the t shirt getting closer to the gas line
billy gets all the creatures off dorry
more creatures come through the door
gary gets scared
he drops the flashlight and runs for the rear exit
screams to gary get back here

gary runs out leaving the others alone
billy and tracy continue to fight the creatures
