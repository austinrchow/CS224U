reflected in its shiny surface are double decker red buses and other present day london traffic
an iron gate opens and two bank guards come in
one of them switches on the lights
on the shelves which line the walls are dusty strong boxes document cases wrapped packages etc
the guards move along the shelves searching for something
somewhere in the vaults of a bank in london is a tin dispatch box with my name on it
it is not to be opened until fifty years after my death
the guards find a battered tin dispatch box with the name john h
painted on it
they remove it from the shelf set it down on a table
the box is tied with heavy cord the knots sealed with wax
strung on the cord is the key
it contains certain mementos of my long association with a man who elevated the science of deduction to an art the worlds first and undoubtedly most famous consulting detective
while one of the guards dusts the box off the other cuts the cord with a pair of scissors
he then inserts the key in the lock turns it raises the lid revealing the dusty contents of the box
the guards now start to remove the objects from the box one at a time a daguerreotype of holmes standing and watson seated in a a stiff studio pose holmes
deerstalker hat his curved pipe his magnifying glass watsons stethoscope holmes revolver a small enamel sign with the number b a pair of handcuffs
a sheet of music paper which is unrolled to disclose a violin piece composed by holmes titled for ilse von h
a pocket watch the back of which is opened to reveal a photograph of gabrielle valladon a signet ring bearing the initials s
under which is concealed a compass a worn morocco case inside which is an early model hypodermic syringe a crystal ball which when shaken produces a snowstorm and when the
snow settles we see a bust of queen victoria
the last item out of the box is a thick stack of manuscript paper bound with green ribbon
the guard undoes the ribbon dusts off the top page as camera moves in closer
written in ink in the cursive penmanship of the period is the following paragraph to my heirs in my lifetime i have recorded some sixty cases demonstrating the singular gift
of my friend sherlock holmes dealing with everything from the hound of the baskervilles to his mysterious brother mycroft and the devilish professor moriarty
but there were other adventures which for reasons of discretion i have decided to withhold from the public until this much later date
they involve matters of a delicate and sometimes scandalous nature as will shortly become apparent
over this we hear the voice of dr
watson reading the text
a passenger train of the late nineteenth century is chugging through the early morning mist
it was august of and we were returning from yorkshire where holmes had solved the baffling murder of colonel abernetty
there are but two passengers in the compartment sitting by the window facing each other
in fact they are dozing
one wears a deerstalker and an inverness cape the other is in a dark overcoat and a black bowler a furled umbrella between his legs a medical bag on the
seat beside him
the rest of their luggage is on the racks above
they are of course sherlock holmes and dr
this being they are thirty three and thirty five respectively
you may recall that he broke the murderers alibi by measuring the depth to which the parsley had sunk in the butter on a hot day
a hansom cab with holmes and watsons luggage strapped to the rack on top is proceeding down the busy street
he was the most brilliant man i have ever known and i dare say people have envied me for sharing that flat with him in baker street
the cab draws up in front of b
the front door opens and mrs
hudson a plump motherly woman in her fifties wearing an apron hurries down the steps
she greets holmes and watson warmly as they alight
ill grant you he was stimulating but he could also be moody unpredictable egocentric and more often than not completely infuriating as our landlady mrs
hudson can attest bless her kind soul
the cabbie starts to unload their luggage
as holmes watson and mrs
hudson proceed inside camera travels up the facade of the building past the number b to the bay window on the second floor
its all there the fireplace the coal scuttle the persian slipper with the tobacco the velvet wing chair the basket chair with the writing arm the couch with the cushions
the sideboard with the tantalus and the gasogene the acid stained deal topped table with holmes chemical equipment on it the dining table the small moorish table the bookshelves and the violin case the gas fixtures and the oil lamps the dumbwaiter connecting with the kitchen in the basement and holmes desk piled high with papers clippings research material etc
holmes is pulling up the window shades
watson has removed his hat and coat and is putting his medical bag down on the sideboard the cabbie having deposited their luggage is just leaving
i do wish youd give me a little more warning when you come home unexpected
i would have roasted a goose and had some flowers for you
my dear mrs
hudson criminals are as unpredictable as head colds
you never quite know when youre going to catch one
he has picked up a dagger starts opening his mail which is on the dining table
ill unpack your bags
she exits into one of the bedrooms
watson has now taken a magazine out of an envelope
heres an advance copy of strand magazine
shows it to holmes theyve printed the red headed league
on the cover is a colored illustration from the story featuring in obligatory inverness and deerstalker
offhand very impressive
leafing through the magazine would you like to see how i treated it
i can hardly wait
im sure ill find out all sorts of fascinating things about the case that i never knew before
just what do you mean by that
oh come now watson you must admit that you have a tendency to over romanticize
you have taken my simple exercises in logic and embellished them exaggerated them
i deny the accusation
you have described me as six foot four whereas i am barely six foot one
a bit of poetic license
removing inverness and deerstalker you have saddled me with this improbable costume which the public now expects me to wear
thats not my doing
indicating cover of strand blame it on the illustrator
youve made me out to be a violin virtuoso
holds out a letter hes been reading a request from the liverpool symphony to appear as soloist in the mendelssohn concerto
excited oh really
the fact is that i could barely hold my own in the pit orchestra of a second rate music hall
youre much too modest
busy with the mail you have given the reader the distinct impression that i am a misogynist
actually i dont dislike women i merely distrust them
the twinkle in the eye and the arsenic in the soup
its those little touches that make you colorful lurid is more like it
you have painted me as a hopeless dope addict just because i occasionally take a five per cent solution of cocaine
a seven per cent solution
five per cent
dont you think im aware youve been diluting it behind my back
as a doctor and as your friend i strongly disapprove of this insidious habit of yours
my dear friend as well as my dear doctor i only resort to narcotics when i am suffering from acute boredom when there are no interesting cases to engage my
holding out one of the open letters look at this an urgent appeal to find six missing midgets
he tosses the letter down is disgust
did you say midgets
he picks up the letter
six of them the tumbling piccolos an acrobatic act with some circus
disappeared between london and bristol dont you find that intriguing
you see they are not only midgets but also anarchists
nodding by now they have been smuggled to vienna dressed as little girls in burgundy pinafores
they are to greet the czar of all the russias when he arrives at the railway station
they will be carrying bouquets of flowers concealed in each bouquet will be a bomb with a lit fuse
you really think so
not at all
the circus owner offers me five pounds for my services thats not even a pound a midget
so obviously he is a stingy blighter and the little chaps simply ran off to join another circus
and it sounded so promising there are no great crimes anymore watson
the criminal class has lost all enterprise and originality
at best they commit some bungling villainy with a motive so transparent that even a scotland yard official can see through it
he has crossed to the desk suddenly notices something
even angrier mrs
hudson comes hurrying out of the bedroom
what is it
what have i done now
sternly there is something missing from my desk
something very crucial
picks up a small feather you have been tidying up against my explicit orders
oh i made sure not to disturb anything
hudson is an essential part of my filing system
by the thickness of it i can date any document immediately
some of the dust was this thick
she demonstrates with her thumb and forefinger
promptly that would be march
he blows the feather away
start on holmes foot operating a bellows
camera pans up to the top of the chemistry table on which an elaborate apparatus of brass glass and rubber tubing has been set up
inserted into the ends of the rubber tubes are half a dozen cigarettes four cigars of different shapes and colors and four pipes all lit
activated by the bellows they are puffing away like mad wheezing loudly and filling the screen with smoke
seated at the table is holmes in shirt sleeves
occasionally he knocks off an ash onto a glass slide studies it under a microscope
watson in a dressing gown is sitting in the chair with the writing arm documenting the latest holmes adventure for strand magazine
the open mail has now been affixed to the center of the wooden mantelpiece with a dagger
hudson is clearing the dinner dishes from the table and loading them onto the shelf of the dumbwaiter
the accumulation of smoke in the room makes her cough
how can you stand this
why dont you let me air the room out
hudson hes working on a definitive study of tobacco ash
drily im sure theres a crying need for that
in our endeavors it is sometimes vital to distinguish between say the ashes of a macedonian cigarette and a jamaican cigar
sor far he has classified different kinds of ashes
all of which will end up on my rug
she is now pulling on the rope which lowers the dumbwaiter
thatll be enough mrs
heading for door all right
if you gentlemen want to stay here and suffocate
she exits shutting the door
for a while the two go on working
then holmes rises abruptly from the chemistry table
i am suffocating
let me open a window
not from lack of air from lack of activity
sitting here week after week blowing smoke rings staring through a microscope theres no challenge in that
personally i consider it a major contribution to scientific criminology
holmes has opened his violin case and taken out his fiddle
how i envy you your mind watson
its placid imperturbable prosaic
but my mind rebels against stagnation
its like a racing engine tearing itself to pieces because its not connected up with the work for which it was built
he has tucked the violin under his chin starts to improvise a nervous pent up melody
there is nothing amateurish about it he plays quite well
watson resumes working on his manuscript
suddenly the music stops
watson looks up apprehensively
holmes has put down the violin and is crossing to the sideboard
he opens watsons medical bag takes out a bottle of cocaine starts toward his bedroom
watson pushes the writing arm to the side rises from his chair
holmes holmes pays no attention continues into the bedroom
watson crosses to the open door
inside the bedroom holmes has put down the cocaine bottle on the washstand and is rolling up his left sleeve
holmes where is your self control
from a drawer he takes a morocco case opens it removes a hypodermic syringe
arent you ashamed of yourself
but this will take care of it
he has removed the stopper from the cocaine bottle and inserting the hypodermic needle into it starts to draw up the liquid
it is raining
a bus comes down the street the open top deck sprouting umbrellas like black mushrooms
naturally i dont mean to imply that my friend was always on cocaine sometimes it was opium sometimes it was hashish
and once he went one of these dreadful binges there was no telling how long it would last
rain beats on the windows
holmes and watson are in the middle of an argument
the only reason you moved in with me is to have a steady supply of stimulants
now now watson you mustnt underestimate your other charms
he starts into the bedroom
holmes i warn you
if you lock yourself in there once more i intend to do nothing of the sort
he takes the hypodermic out of the drawer in the washstand starts back into the living room with it
not until you replace this needle
it is getting rather blunt
as watson glares at him the door opens and mrs
hudson comes bustling in
holmes hides the hypodermic behind his back
i made you some tea and cress sandwiches
she opens the door of the dumbwaiter starts to pull it up
hudson i want you to pack my bags
are you going away for the weekend
im moving out
she looks at holmes im just as surprised as you are
you heard me mrs
and lets not waste any time
hudson sighs exits into watsons bedroom
may i be so bold as to ask where youer going
i dont know yet
but i intend to resume my practice
i am after all a doctor
and quite a competent one if i say so as shouldnt
youll find it very dull snipping out tonsils and flushing out kidneys watson is glancing around the room searching for something
if youre looking for your medical bag you hid it under the moorish table
as watson crosses to it which shows a little more imagination than last time when it was under your bed
watson picks up the moorish table disclosing the medical bag standing on end
he sets the bag down on the fender opens it
i will of course continue to pay my half of the rent until you find someone to share these rooms with you
where am i going to find anyone who will put up with my rather eccentric habits
taking hypodermic needle out of bag heres a fresh needle and heres my farewell present to you
he takes out three bottles of narcotics puts them on the mantel
if you want to destroy yourself go right ahead
but i wont sit by and watch you doing it
he snaps his bag shut carries it toward his bedroom
watson disappears into the bedroom slamming the door
holmes looks after him then looks at the bottles of dope on the mantelpiece
he starts pacing
after a moment he stops at the chemistry table studies the assorted glassware on the shelves above
there are two open valises on the bed
watson is moving around the room collecting various odds and ends while mrs
hudson packs his clothes
its so sad
you and mr
holmes after all these years she sobs
hudson none of that
hudson takes a clean handkerchief from the open valise blows her nose
ill wash this and send it on to you
ill be at browns hotel
still sniffling i know how it feels i once went through a divorce myself
removing diploma from wall actually im rather looking forward to it
leading a normal life again
regular office hours nine to three and if occasionally theres an emergency call in the middle of the night i know its going be appendicitis and not an ax murder
let holmes go mucking about in the fog and the sleet looking for a bloodstained collar button out on the moors with some demented hound snapping at his behind from
the living room comes the sound of a revolver shot
hudson screams and watson looks off in alarm
then he races out of the room diploma in hand followed by mrs
as they burst into the room they see holmes sitting on the stool beside the chemistry table a revolver in his hand
he has shattered one of the narcotics bottles on the mantelpiece and is aiming at a second one
holmes fires smashing the second bottle
hudson takes a step forward he waves her away with the gun
youre in my line of fire
watson jerks mrs
hudson back as holmes lets go with another shot
the bullet disposes of the third bottle splattering glass and liquid all over the place
holmes rises calmly from the stool crosses to the desk puts the revolver away in a drawer
outraged how many times have i told you i will not tolerate pistol practice on my premises
i should have evicted you when you shot them holes in my wall
she points up to a spot near the ceiling
neatly traced in bullet holes are the initials v
with a small crown above them
merely celebrating her majestys golden jubilee
look at that mess you made watson is looking at holmes with a little smile on his face
its all right mrs
ill clean it up hands her the diploma while you unpack my things
you heard him
a bewildered mrs
hudson goes back into the bedroom
watson crosses to the fireplace picks up the whiskbroom and the coal shovel starts cleaning up the broken glass
thank you holmes
i know how difficult it mustve been for you
it was simple choice between a bad habit and a good companion
youve made me very happy
ive often been accused of being cold and unemotional
i admit to it
and yet in my cold unemotional way im very fond of you watson
i know that
but one likes to hear these things occasionally
he notices the violin which has been splattered with the liquid from the shattered bottle picks it up
look at this
covered with that nasty stuff
id better dry it off
ill do it
he takes the instrument and dabbing it with a handkerchief carries it toward the violin case
for a moment i was worried that you were going to let me walk out that you werent even going to try to stop me
now watson you know theres nothing i wouldnt do to keep you here
with a side glance at the busy watson he opens the violin case
neatly stashed away around the edges are the three original bottles of narcotics
the ones he shot up of course were substitutes from the chemistry set
he places the violin carefully among the bottles closes the case snaps the locks
as he moves off we stay on the violin case
it was not the first not the last time he tricked me like that
normally i was inclined to forgive him
watson in his dressing gown is sitting at the table finishing his coffee
in front of him is a letter on blue note paper and a pair of theatre tickets
but on one occasion he did something that was so utterly unforgivable that i would gladly have murdered him had it not been for my saintly disposition
watson sets down his coffee cup picks up the letter and the tickets rises from his chair
he starts to pace addressing holmes who is off scene
why are you being so stubborn holmes
why wont you go
its the final performance of the imperial russian ballet the house has been sold out for months he moves towards the door of holmes is sitting in a hip bath
with a high back soaping himself
watson appears in the doorway
seats are going for a guinea apiece thats precisely it
why should someone send up two free tickets
anonymously at that
whoever sent them must be in great distress
the note says
reading it please
you are the only man in the world who can help me
i suspect its some sort of plot
you mean somebody wants to lure us into a trap
somebody wants to kill me
its a plot to bore me to death
i detest ballet
but this isnt just any ballet
its swan lake
start on the conductor in the orchestra pit as he gives the downbeat for the second acto music of swan lake
camera pulls back to include the stage with a mechanical sway crossing the mist shrouded lake
camera continues to pull back revealing holmes and watson in evening clothes occupying a box in the upper tier
confidentially you know of course holmes that swan isnt really a swan its an enchanted princess
on the stage now the hunters appear carrying lighted torches
watson trains his opera glasses on the stage holmes stifles a yawn
petrova as the queen of the swans makes her entrance to loud applause
she is in her forties but splendidly preserved undoubtedly the greatest ballerina around
watson nudges holmes who has dozed off
fabulous woman dont you think so holmes
coming to who
the great petrova
he hands the glasses to holmes who focuses them indifferently on the stage
petrova is making an exit backwards on points
holmes lowers the glasses returns them to watson
very strong arches i must admit
they say twelve men have died for her
six committed suicide four were killed in duels and one fell out of the gallery in the vienna opera house
thats only eleven
the man who fell from the gallery landed on top of another man in the orchestra
that makes an even dozen in a messy sort of way
watson resumes watching the stage through the glasses
petrova and the dancer playing the prince go into the famous pas de deux
watson enjoying himself immensely holmes sitting there dourly
the red plush curtain at the rear of the box parts and a man in evening clothes and a top hat enters
he is in his middle fifties extremely soigne and somewhat sinister
his name is rogozhin and he is russian
holmes and watson look around
i am nicolai rogozhin director general of the imperial russian ballet
so glad you accept invitation
holmes and watson start to get up but he motions them back into their chairs
this is dr
pleased to meet you
seating himself behind them you are enjoying
abruptly tell me mr
holmes how is your health
better consult my doctor
to rogozhin oh hes in excellent shape
to holmes any insanity in your family
would you mind telling me what this is all about
madame petrova she has problem
could you be more specific
a liason with a crowned head
he glances toward the stage
the pas de deux finished to a rousing ovation
rogozhin rises turns to holmes
after performance there will be little celebration backstage and madame requests your presence
wed be delighted
to watson you are invited also
with a parting look he exits pulling the plush curtains closed
the performance is over the curtain is up the party is on
tables have been set up with caviar vodka and champagne
the members of the orchestra are now playing balalaikas and crew and cast the ballerinas still in costume the male dancers in tights seem in high spirits
holmes and watson in silk hats with canes appear from the wings stop survey the scene
watsons eyes are shining with anticipation
in contrast holmes face is sober and quizzical
rogozhin spots the two detaches himself from a group hurries over to join them
there you are mr
madame is expecting you in her dressing room
watson you will amuse yourself meanwhile we have vodka caviar girls
no thank you
makes me break out in hives
rogozhin turns to a group of ballerinas claps his hands
siude siuda dievushki
posnakomtes s docktorum watsonom
half a dozen ballerinas descend on on dr
they are giggling and chattering in russian
rogozhin leads holmes off while watson takes in the bevy of beauties around him
any of you girls understand english
not one single word
in that case i dont mind telling you that you all have lovely po pos
he pats a couple of the po pos with his cane
rogozhin is leading holmes toward madame petrovas dressing room
holmes i must prepare you this is no ordinary case
it is only the extraordinary that interests me
because you will find this extra extraordinary
they have now reached the door of madames dressing room
the door is opened by an elderly russian maid
madame petrova prinimaet
rogozhin leads holmes inside
the maid steps out shuts the door
it is small elegant and sensuous
there is vodka in an ice bucket next to a recamier chaise a paravent masses of flowers and finally madame petrova still in costume sitting at a dressing table with
multiple mirrors undoing her hair
candles in two elaborate candleabra give madames face a special glow
ja priviol vam mistera sherlock holmesa doragaia
to holmes otchen rada
she extends her hand and holmes takes it
he kisses her hand
petrova appraises him from head to toe and back again
to holmes vi menshe rostom chem ja ozhidala
madame says you are shorter than she thought
i didnt mean to be
no eto nie vazhno
menia interessujut glavnim obra som vashi mosghi
short tall who cares
it is the brains that count
to rogozhin thank you
catching himself to petrova thank you
petrova rises crosses to the paravent
ja prochia vsie vashi prikliuchenia
os sobenno sobaka baskervillei
madame is great admirer of yours
she has read every story her favorite is big dog from baskerville
im afraid it loses something in translation
petrova is now behind the paravent undressing only her head visible
nikolai pokazhite iemu skripku
rogozhin picks up a violin case opens it
holmes you know about fiddles
takes violin out hands it to him what is your opinion of this
holmes holds the violin up peers through one of the sound holes
reading antonius stradivarius cremonesis anno
well the label is authentic
examines violin plucks strings judging from the shape the color of the varnish and the tone i would say it is a genuine stradivarius of the best period
from behind paravent skazhite jemu chto eto podarok ot menia
here take it
madame says it is yours
for services you will render
my fees as a detective are not exactly trifling but a stradivarius youre not serious
i am not
but madame is
petrova emerges from behind the paravent in a brocade dressing gown
nalejte vodki i obiasnite jemu v chom dielo
she drapes herself on the chaise
i will pour vodka and explain
starts pouring vodka it is pink mr
holmes what you have seen tonight is last and positively final performance of madame petrova
she is retiring
what a shame
she has been dancing since she was three years old
and after all she is now thirty eight
gallantly i must say she doesnt look thirty eight
that is because she is forty nine
he hands her a glass of vodka with an exaggerated smile so madame has decided to leave ballet and spend life bringing up her child
hands him vodka problem now is to find father
is he missing
and thats why you called me in
we must have father because without father how can there be child
the whole thing is still in the planning stage correct again
madame would like child to be brilliant and beautiful
since she is beautiful she now needs man who is brilliant
holmes eyes wander slowly toward petrova
she raises her glass
raising his glass za zdorovie
petrova and rogozhin down their vodka bottoms up
holmes takes one swallow then stops
whats in it
what does it taste like
thats whats in it
while rogozhin refills petrovas glass and his own holmes takes another tentative sip
to holmes kogda mi smozhem dvinutsa v putj
i beg your pardon
madame wants to know how soon you can be ready
to leave for venice
all arrangements have been made
you will spend one week there with madame
well this is all very flattering
but surely there are other me better men to tell you truth you were not first choice
we considered russian writer tolstoi thats more like it
the mans a genius
then we considered the philosopher nietzsche absolutely first rate mind
and we considered tschaikowski oh you couldnt go wrong with tschaikowski we could and we did
it was catastrophe
you dont know
because tschaikowski how shall put it
women not his glass of tea
to rogozhin skazhite jemu chto je otchen dovolna etim resheniem
madame is very happy with final choice
madame mustnt be too hasty
she must remember im an englishman
you know what they say about us
if theres one thing more deplorable than our cooking its our love making
we are not exactly the most romantic of people perfect
we dont want sentimental idiots falling in love committing suicide
one week in venice she goes back to st
petersburg with baby you go back to london with fiddle
an equitable arrangement
puts down violin about my medical history when you asked me i neglected to mention a small detail
there is hemophilia in my family
were all bleeders
to petrova on govorit chto v jevo semie stradajut ghemofilijei
pust nie bezpokoitsa
ja ostrighu sebe noghti
madame says not to worry
she will not scratch you
thats reassuring to know
but to rogozhin pochemu on kolebletsa
on nie nahodit menia dostatochno privlekatelnoi
madame says you talk too much
you find her attractive or no
before holmes can answer the door opens and watson sticks his head in
he is flushed and slightly inebriated and there is a flower tucked behind his ear
from off comes the sound of wild balalaika music
to rogozhin what does prokanzik mean
it means you little devil
he hurries off shutting the door
to holmes i repeat question
you find madame attractive or no
holmes is still looking at the door where watson exited an idea forming in his mind
turning to rogozhin oh i find her most attractive for a woman that is
then no problem
maybe a slight one
you see i am not a free man
you are a bachelor
a bachelor living with another bachelor for the last five years
five very happy years
what is it you are trying to tell me
i hoped i could avoid the subject
but some of us through a cruel caprice of mother nature get to point
the point is that tschaikowski is not an isolated case
you mean you and dr
holmes nods he is your glass of tea
if you want to be picturesque about it
slightly agitated chto on govorit
pri chom tut chaikovsky
on her feet now flaring jescho odin
eto stanovitsa odnoobrasno
kakoi vi idiot
picking up his silk hat and cane believe me madame the loss is all mine
but i would prefer to disappoint you know than disappoint you in a gondola in venice
he takes her limp hand kisses it
then he crosses to the door
imitating rogozhins accent it would have been catastrophe
rogozhin starts to pour himself another glass of vodka
petrova slaps the glass out of his hand
screaming potchemu vi nie vijasnili eto eto ranshe prezhde chem posoritj menia
the party has built into a real wingding by now
its wild drinking laughing singing
everybody is turned on especially watson
he is dancing with a dozen of the ballerinas to madly accelerating balalaika music
flower behind ear hair mussed tie undone short of breath he is in paradise
holmes makes his way through the revelers approaches watson
watson pays no attention watson are you coming
without missing a step what is it old boy
were going home
not a chance
not the slightest not the remotest chance
he waves goodbye and goes on swirling dizzily with the girls
holmes puts on his silk hat and leaves
a shaken rogozhin comes up to the buffet pours himself a stiff drink of vodka
as he drinks his eyes follow the dancing watson balefully
watson spins off several of the girls grabs another group
his ex partners wind up close to rogozhin
he whispers something to them
their eyes widen and they stare at watson with disbelief
watson again switches partners and the first girls now whisper intensely to those who just left the floor
the same reaction
watson oblivious to all this is whirling around with another set of girls
by now some of the girls who are in on the secret are whispering to the male dancers in tights
their reaction is slightly different
they are seeing watson in a new light
and before watson knows whats happening he has been abandoned by all the girls and is joined first by one pair then another pair of male dancers till he is
dancing only with gay guys in tights
it gradually dawns on watson that there is something wrong with this state of affairs
after some difficulty he breaks away from them
just a moment
spotting rogozhin he crosses to him
the girls shrink away at his approach
bewildered whats going on
what happened to the girls
do you not prefer it this way
you dont have to pretend
holmes told us everything about you and him about me and him
come now no need to be bashful
we are not bourgeois
maybe with doctors and detectives is unusual but in ballet is very usual
caprice of mother nature
look at pavel and mischa and boris and dmitri watson looks around at the boys in tights who are standing in a half circle grinning at him insolently
it is beginning to dawn on him
and ilya and sergei breaks off rocks his hand back and forth sergei half and half
he pours himself another vodka
watson grabs the glass away from him downs it with a gulp
in contrast to the frenetic ambiance of the back stage party the room seems doubly placid
holmes his dinner coat replaced by a smoking jacket is sitting in the wing chair having a quiet pipe after the evenings peculiar adventure
only the desk lamp is lit
from the street there is the sound of hurried angry footsteps approaching the house
holmes turns his head languidly he knows who is coming
an enraged watson cane and opera glasses in hand and the flower still behind his ear is jogging down the center of the deserted street
holmes rises casually twists the wing chair so that its back is to the door crosses to the lamp on the desk turns the wick down
from off comes the sound of watsons key rattling in the front door lock
the front door opens and watson storms into the vestibule
he races up the stairs and across the landing flings open the door of the flat
watson grim and breathless stands in the open doorway
over the back of the wing chair he sees smoke curling up from holmes pipe
there you are you wretch
of all the vile unspeakable fabrications
what do you have to say for yourself
no answer from holmes
we now see but watson does not that the chair is occupied by a section of holmes smoking machine with the pipe attached
dont just sit there speak up man
still no answer just a little pipe smoke drifting up from the wing chair
incensed watson raises the opera glasses tosses them toward the chair
there is a loud thud the pipe falls to the floor then there is silence
watson suddenly becomes concerned
are you all right holmes
he approaches the chair apprehensively shoves it aside and there on the floor is the smoking machine still wheezing slightly
watson picks it up and his eyes travel to holmes standing in a shadowy corner working the bellows with his foot
from the sound of your footsteps i gathered that you were not in a particularly amiable mood
with renewed fury how could you do a dastardly thing like that to me
what the deuce were you thinking of
he dashes the smoking machine to the floor
watson you have my most abject apologies
but have you ever been cornered by a madwoman
it seemed like the only way to get out of it without hurting her feelings
what about my feelings
and my reputation
do you realize the gravity of what you have done
the possible repercussions
so therell be a little gossip about you in st
these things spread like wildfire
i can just hear those malicious whispers behind my back
ill never be able to show my face in polite society
and if it ever got back to my old regiment you dont know the fifth northumberland fusiliers theyll strike me off the rolls theyll cut off my pension
watson youre running amok
dishonored disgraced ostracized
what am i to do
well for one thing id get rid of that flower
he points to the flower behind watsons ear
watson grabs the flower hurls it into the fireplace
you may think this is funny but were both in the same boat
we must take desperate measures
we must stop this talk
a beat then an idea maybe if we got married
then theyd really talk
starts pacing obviously we cannot continue to live under the same roof
we must move apart
of course we can still see each other clandestinely on remote benches in hyde park and in the waiting rooms of suburban railway stations a change in attitude defiant the
whole thing is ridiculous
we have nothing to hide
thats what ive been trying to tell you
let somebody start a rumor just one ugly word and well sue them for slander
nobody would dare
after all you have an enviable record with the fair sex
i can get women from three continents to testify for me
and you can get women to vouch for you too cant you holmes
no answer from holmes
watson is becoming a little concerned
can you holmes
good night watson
he starts toward his bedroom
holmes let me ask you a question holmes stops i hope im not being presumptuous but there have been women in your life
the answer is yes
a relieved sigh from watson youre being presumptuous
watsons face falls good night
he walks into his bedroom shutting the door
watson takes a tentative step after him
there is a cheery fire burning in the grate
holmes is stretched out full length on the couch playing a set of corelli variations on his violin
watson is in his usual chair reading the evening standard
what indeed was his attitude toward women
was there some secret he was holding back or was he just a thinking machine incapable of any emotion
wisps of fog swirl along the street making yellow haloes around street lamps
i was not to get the answer until we became involved in what i consider to be the most outrageous case in all our years together
out of the mist comes a hansom cab with the dim figure of a woman visible in the passenger seat
the cab stops in front of b and the driver starts to get down
from upstairs comes the faint sound of violin music
watson steps up to the window pulls the curtain aside looks down toward the street
the cabbie crosses the pavement consults an address in his hand glances up at the number of the house then rings the bell
watson turns away from the window as the bell downstairs rings again
holmes stops playing
were you expecting someone
not at this hour
hudson is entertaining
i never found her so
watson crosses to the door opens it steps out
holmes resumes playing corelli
hudson in a robe and night cap is talking to the cabbie in the open street door when watson appears on the landing above
what is it mrs
looking up theres a cabbie here he says you owe him two and six
to watson for the fare guvnor
the young lady doesnt have any money
what young lady
he reaches out the door pulls in the young lady in question
she is in her early thirties with strikingly handsome features but at the moment she is somewhat worse for wear
she is wrapped in a blanket her hair is wet and there is a bruise on her temple
she is wearing and wedding ring and her name we will subsequently learn is gabrielle
what have we here
he starts down the stairs who are you miss
what happened to you
slight accent i dont know
thats all she keeps saying i dont know i dont know
the violin music stops o
watson has now reached the foot of the stairs
where did she come from
from the river
i was driving down the embankment just below westminster bridge and there she was in the water drowning
holmes appears on the landing above violin and bow in his hand
it wasnt easy guvnor what with the cold water and her fighting me from the upper landing why did you bring her here
because i found this in her hand gives a square of soggy cardboard to watson b baker street thats right isnt it
watson examines the cardboard nods
to gabrielle young lady what did you want at this address
looking up trying to focus i do not remember
to holmes rather perplexing wouldnt you say
well gentlemen you want her
its two and six or shall i throw her back in the river
you cant let him watson youd better accept delivery
watson fishes some coins out of his pocket hands them to the cabbie
keep the change
thank you guvnor
he snatches the blanket off gabrielle revealing that her dress is clinging to her damply
no extra charge for the use of the horse blanket
he exits into the street shutting the door
gabrielle hugs herself for warmth
youre shivering my dear
he puts his arm around her
let me get you out of those wet clothes
he starts to lead her up the stairs
the cabbie has tossed the blanket into the hansom and is mounting the drivers seat
across the street a man steps out of the fog into a pool of light cast by one of the street lamps
he is a craggy faced prussian of about fifty and his name is von tirpitz
he looks up toward the holmes flat
as the hansom makes a u turn and comes abreast of him he hops into the cab
the hansom disappears into the fog
watson is leading gabrielle to a chair by the fireplace
holmes is putting his violin down on the table
sit here my dear
he settles her in the chair
holmes comes over plucks the square of cardboard from watsons hand
shes suffering from shock and exposure
he starts to massage her wrists to restore her circulation
holmes is examining the soggy cardboard
on one side is their address written in pencil
he turns it over disclosing some smudges of green ink on the other side
there was some printing on the back of this but it seems to have come off in the water
watson is now studying the bruise on gabrielles temple
look at this shes had a nasty blow on the head
could she have hit her head when she fell or jumped into the river
the blood has already coagulated
so it would appear that she was the victim of a deliberate attack
get my bag will you
as holmes fetches the medical bag gabrielle looks from one to the other
who are you
watson and this is mr
do the names mean anything to you
can you think of your own name
a beat then shakes her head no
shes obviously had a concussion which often leads to temporary amnesia
he has now taken some cotton and a bottle of antiseptic out of the medical bag and is swabbing her wound
so all we know is that she was coshed on the head dumped into the thames and subsequently dumped into our laps
we know a lot more than that
from her accent we know she is foreign from her ring we know she is married and there is one other clue we have
something i deduced while i was helping her up the stairs
he glances down at gabrielles shoe which has slipped off her foot
inside slightly worn away are the words to gabrielle are you french
in berlitz french vous etes francaise
concentrating then non je ne suis pas francaise
how can she say shes not french in french
vous etes suisse
alors vous etes belge
haltingly je suis pas sure
holmes reaches behind her turns back the collar of her dress
sewn inside is a label reading bazaar modern bruxelles
vous etes belge de bruxelles
je pense que oui
hudson has come in with a loaded tea tray starts to put it down on the table
will someone remove the violin please
watson takes the violin off the table and she sets down the tray
we just found out that shes belgian
taking gabrielles hand if you dont mind
he slips the wedding ring off her finger picks up a magnifying glass examines it
it is made of copper and engraved on the inside is the inscription gabrielle emile
your name is gabrielle is that right
i dont know
and your husbands name is emile
where is he
what are you doing in london
i dont know
when did you arrive from brussels
where are you staying
i dont know
what happened at the river
gabrielle bursts into sobs
stepping forward thats enough holmes
i will not permit you to question her in this condition
helps the sobbing gabrielle out of the chair mrs
hudson put her to bed
hudson gives him a look ill sleep on the couch
come my dear
she puts her arm around gabrielle who is still crying leads her into watsons bedroom
id better mix her a sleeping potion
he gets a packet of white powder out of his medical bag and during the following stirs a spoonful into her tea cup
watson i think we should arrange to have her removed to a hospital
under no circumstances
she should have medical attention
she can get that from me
but more importantly she must be protected there has already been one attempt on her life
this temporary amnesia how temporary is it
it depends on the extent of the injury
its like veils shrouding her memory
it could clear up in a few days or a few weeks
watson this is a very small flat we dont want to clutter it up with women
holmes weve never had a case like this
a woman comes to us with a problem we dont know who the woman is and we dont know what the problem is
dont you find that challenging
but we cant afford to wait for those veils to lift we must break through them as quickly as possible
you really feel its that urgent
the sooner we solve the case the sooner we can get rid of her
he picks up the cup of tea with the sedative in it carries it toward the door of his bedroom
the street lamps are still lit
a policeman on patrol duty is strolling along the sidewalk swinging his truncheon
suddenly he sees something up ahead
alarmed he ducks into the doorway of a building flattens himself against the door
from the opposite direction comes a horse drawn water sprinkling wagon
the spray covers the sidewalks as well as the street
the policeman waits till the wagon is past then steps out of the doorway relieved resumes his patrol
watson is asleep on the couch covered with a blanket
he doesnt look as if he were in a very comfortable position
holmes in a dressing gown is standing by the window studying the square of cardboard with the green smudges on it
his bed has not been slept in
gabrielle is asleep in watsons bed
the door opens slowly and holmes looks in
he studies the sleeping gabrielle for a moment then quietly pulls the door shut
as the latch clicks into place gabrielle awakes and sits up in bed her back to camera
she is nude
she starts to get out of bed
holmes is back in his room once more examining the cardboard by the light of the window
the door of watsons bedroom opens and gabrielle comes out
holmes looks up as gabrielle appears in the open doorway
is that you emile
stepping into shadow yes gabrielle
hurrying toward him ah emile
i thought id never find you
embracing him hold me
hold me tight
holmes puts his arms around her its been such a long time
so many nights
you know what i did before i left brussels
i hope you wont be angry with me
i bought myself an expensive negligee
moving toward bed a pink negligee with maribou feathers
dont you think thats a foolish thing for a married woman
she gets into bed beckons to him come
where is the negligee
in my luggage
moving toward her and where is your luggage
impatiently i dont know
come my love
as she extends her right hand to him in a beckoning gesture holmes notices something on the palm
he takes her hand in his
there in the same green ink as the smudges on the cardboard are what appear the be the letters i o and greek e
crossing to the wash stand he picks up his magnifying shaving mirror returns to the bed holds it up against the palm of gabrielles hand
what is it emile
what are you doing
clearly reflected in the mirror is the reverse image of the lettering on gabrielles palm the number
the table is set for breakfast and mrs
hudson is opening the curtains flooding the room with sunlight
then she moves over to the couch where watson is sleeping in an awkward position
she claps her hands and he wakes up your porridge is getting lumpy
hadnt you better get up
watson tries to rise falls back with a moan
i would like to very much
but he turns over on his stomach mrs
hudson would you mind planting your knee in the small of my back
yes i would
im in excruciating pain
hudson tentatively rests her knee on watsons back
a bit higher just below my seventh vertebra mrs
hudson follows instructions thats good
put your arms under mine fold them behind my neck mrs
hudson presses down harder and there is a distinct snap
he rises rubbing his neck that damn couch
crossing to table youd better see if our patient is awake
he seats himself at the table
hudson crosses to the door of watsons bedroom opens it starts inside then stops
he jumps up from the table joins mrs
hudson looks past her
the bed is empty
gabrielles clothes are in evidence but there is no sign of her
watson strides towards holmes bedroom
he throws the door open is about to step inside when he sees something that makes him freeze
gabrielle is asleep in holmes bed covered by just a sheet and obviously naked underneath
holmes is not in the room
hudson comes up behind watson in the open doorway peers over his shoulder
scandalized well i never
there is the sound of the hall door opening and they both turn
holmes breezes in carrying a large suitcase with leather straps around it
tucked under the straps is a white parasol
and attached to the handle of the suitcase is a cardboard tag with the number on it in green
inhaling deeply mmmmm
i smell porridge
lumpy as usual i suppose
he sets the suitcase down on the couch as watson and mrs
oh there you are holmes
we were just wondering how points from his bedroom to holmes sternly we certainly were
hudson why dont you go down to the kitchen get a towel and wipe that look of disapproval off your face
liberties in my house
she exits huffily
you cant really blame her i mean the way it looks if i didnt know you better i might suspect youd taken advantage of the young lady
as a matter of fact i did take advantage of her
would you hand me the butter knife please
he picks up the butter knife from the table suddenly turns back with a delayed reaction
you did what
taking butter knife from him thank you
he starts to pry open the locks of the suitcase with the butter knife
spluttering holmes this is reprehensible
where are your professional ethics
have you no sense of decency no shame none whatsoever
if you must know i found her body quite rewarding
especially the palm of her right hand
id rather not hear about it
then i wont bother to tell you how i traced her suitcase
thats her suitcase
remember that piece of soggy cardboard with our address on it
it was a luggage ticket the number rubbed off on her hand
and since she must have arrived from brussels by the boat train i concluded that she had checked her belongings at victoria station
if youre right we should find a clue to her identity
holmes has now forced open the locks
or at least a pink negligee with maribou feathers
he opens the suitcase lifts out the top piece of clothing holds it up a pink negligee with maribou feathers
lets see what else is in here
they start sorting through the clothes in the suitcase
holmes removes a tied bundle of letters
now were getting somewhere
as he examines the envelope watson takes out a framed photo of a rather attractive man of fifty
who do you suppose this is
gabrielle appears from holmes bedroom wearing holmes dressing gown
she is unsteady on her feet and somewhat dazed
holmes looks up
come in madame valladon
gabrielle stops you are gabrielle valladon
holding up photo and this is your husband emile valladon
her eyes fall on the open suitcase
sorry to have ransacked your valise
but since you came to us for help where am i
b baker street
a beat as she orients herself which of you is mr
holmes and which is dr
watson is the handsome one
watson pleased twirls the end of his mustache
gabrielle sways slightly
thats the way he affects most women
he helps her into a chair
to gabrielle coffee
you want strong coffee
he hurries over to the breakfast table
its all so confusing
lets try to sort it out
you came to london looking for your husband
hes a mining engineer
we were married five years ago in the congo
where your husband was working in a copper mine
how did you know
your wedding ring its made of copper
he picks it up from the chemistry table hands it to her
gabrielle starts to put it on
last year he invented a new kind of air pump and was hired by an english company jonah limited
handing her cup of of coffee here you are
weve been writing to each other regularly
then suddenly three weeks ago his letters stopped
i kept writing but no answer
finally i decided to go to that address
she indicates the bundle of letters
holmes glances at the return address on the back of the envelope
its just an empty store nobody there
then i tried to find jonah limited
no such company exists
how decidedly odd
madame valladon can you think of any reason why your husband should have lied to you about theses things
he loves me and i love him
so i gathered
i went to the police they said they would send out a missing persons report but they didnt sound too encouraging
then i went to the belgian embassy and explained the situation to them and they suggested that i consult you
you could have done worse
i was on my way here and suddenly there were footsteps behind me and a hand over my mouth and the smell of choloroform and the next thing i knew
i was in the water and then a man was wrapping me in a blanket madame valladon somebody tried to kill you last night
do you have any idea who could have done it
i dont understand any of it
rises goes to holmes what does it all mean mr
where is my husband
you must help me find him
well do our best i assure you
madame valladon i want you to send one more letter to your husband
he crosses to the desk picks up a sheet of paper and an envelope then leads gabrielle over to the chair with the writing arm seats her in it
to emile valladon ashdown street what was that number
what do you want me to say in the letter
he folds the blank sheet of paper and as gabrielle finishes addressing the envelope he inserts the paper in it starts to seal it
youre sending an empty sheet of paper to an empty shop
that empty shop is obviously being used as an accomodation address or letter drop
but what gets dropped must be picked up
the question is how
and by whom
this is a run down district in the northwestern part of london
on the corner is no
a dilapidated abandoned shop with windows painted halfway up
as camera approaches the building we hear sawing from inside
it is dusty cobwebby quite forbidding
in the rear wall is a closed sliding door indented about a foot into the shop
nearby stands a large square object covered with a tarpaulin
high up in the rear wall is a slanted skylight fitted with an iron grill
from outside holmes in deerstalker and inverness can be seen sawing through the iron bars
watson and gabrielle are beside him
watson hands him the indicated tools
holmes chips away the cement from the top and bottom of the last bar then using it as a hinge swings the grill open
he lets himself through the skylight drops to the floor
watson now helps gabrielle through the skylight lowers her toward holmes who puts his arms around her waist eases her to the floor
for a brief moment he keeps his arms around her
watson has now squeezed through the skylight
he hands the tools to holmes jumps to the floor
gabrielle is looking around the shop
its so strange to think ive been writing to a place like this all these months
watson crosses to the square tarpaulin covered object
he lifts up one corner of the tarp and is greeted by a loud twittering of birds
what he has uncovered is a large cage and about a hundred canaries suddenly disturbed are flapping around unside
look at all these canaries
do you suppose this could have been a pet shop
pointing off here comes our letter
through the front window the silhouette of a postman can be seen approaching
he drops a letter through the slot in the front door moves on
the letter lands on a section of floor which is solidly covered with dust except for a series of double tracks running to the door and curving back
now we are faced with the most nerve wracking part of the detectives job doing nothing
he reassembles the three tools fitting each section into another to form a cane
i dont know how im going to pay you for all this
the purse with my money is somewhere at the bottom of the thames
it could be worse
you could be at the bottom of the thames much to your discomfort and much to my chagrin
i dont understand how anybody picks up letters here
pointing no footprints just tracks
what does it mean
i would surmise somebody is using ice skates if it werent for a conspicuous absence of ice
they become aware of a squeaking noise outside the rear of the shop growing louder as it gets nearer
the noise stops there is the sound of a lock turning then the rattle of a chain
in a frantic whisper what do we do now
unfazed this way
he leads gabrielle and watson toward the rear wall right next to the door
they flatten themselves with their backs to the wall just as the door slides open concealing them from view
revealed is the mews behind the shop
in the door is an old biddy with straggly hair sitting in a wheelchair
in her lap are a bulky paper bag and a tin pitcher filled with water
as she wheels herself inside the unoiled wheelchair squeaks loudly
she stops in front of the cage pulls on a rope which runs through a pulley in the ceiling and the tarpaulin rises into the air exposing the canaries
addressing birds good morning my pretties
heres mum with your breakfast
did you think id forgotten you
she pours grain from the paper bag into a feeder hanging inside the cage pours water from the pitcher into a trough
some of you will be going on a little trip soon i hate to lose you but even an old woman has to live
although you might well ask why
she cackles to herself glances toward the front door
you never told me we had a letter
she starts to wheel herself toward the front of the shop
through a crack in the door behind which our three are hiding we see holmes eye watching her
the old woman reaches the letter picks it up studies the address
then she hears something glances toward the open rear door
a horse drawn wagon with a canvas top is just pulling into the mews
two carters jump down from the drivers seat and one of them takes a small bird cage from the back of the wagon
as they start in through the door the old woman drops the letter into her lap wheels herself toward them
what have you been doing with yourself
what do you think
taking dancing lessons
she stops in front of the cage how many do you want this time
he opens the door of the small cage the bottom of which is covered with newspaper starts transferring canaries into it from the large cage
what are they doing with all those canaries
whats going on up there
look duchess we dont know and we dont want to know
when you work for jonah its better not to ask questions
through the crack in the door behind which he is hidden we see holmes eye studying the small bird cage as the canaries are being transferred into it
we move in close on the small cage and see the soiled newspaper spread on the bottom
the masthead reads counting as he transfers canaries twenty two twenty three twenty four
he closes the doors of the cages picks up the small cage
his companion indicates the letter in the womans lap
how about that letter
does that go too
thats going to be picked up in person
the carriers exit into the mews stash the cage in the back of the wagon mount the drivers seat
to birds all right my pretties
back to sleep you go
see you tomorrow
she pulls the rope and the tarpaulin drops back over the cage
then she deposits the letter on top of the covered cage wheels herself out the rear door
as she slides it shut from outside our trio is revealed in their hiding places behind the door
there is the sound of the chain rattling the lock snapping and the squeaky wheels moving off
a sigh of relief i really thought we were done for
casually the art of concealment my dear watson is merely a matter of being in the right place at the right time
they step forward and through the painted shop window watch the old woman wheel herself down the street
did you hear what she said
you really think emile is going to pick up the letter himself
it certainly would simplify things wouldnt it
shaking his head maildrops and canaries and wheelchairs
and what was all that about jonah
and what do you suppose theyre doing up there
and where is up there
my guess would be scotland
inverness to be more precise
didnt you notice the paper at the bottom of their cage
the inverness courier
gabrielle glances casually at the letter the old woman left lying on top of the cage and her expression changes
this letter she picks it up what about it
holding it out to him its addressed to you
holmes takes the letter examines the envelope
it is indeed addressed to him
nevertheless with the saw end of his cane he slits the envelope open removes the enclosure unfolds it
we see the letter in his hand as he reads it out loud
the letterhead says diogenes club st
reading my dear sherlock i expect you and dr
watson to join me at the club immediately upon reciept of this note
according to my calculations that should be at a
your brother mycroft
looking up what time do you make it watson
either your watch is wrong or mycroft has miscalculated
and knowing mycroft i suggest you reset your watch
watson automatcially obeys
holmes cane in hand and watson are swiftly ascending the steps of a building with an imposing palladian facade
beside the entrance is a discreet sign reading diogenes club
as they reach the top of the steps watson stops holmes
i dont mind telling you im a bit apprehensive about this
im rather curious myself as to what is going on in that machiavellian mind of his
i dont mean mycroft i mean madame valladon
shes perfectly safe with mrs
he opens the door and they start in
dominating the lobby is a large statue of queen victoria
presiding over the reception desk is a uniformed porter of military bearing with one arm and a chest full of campaign ribbons
holmes and watson stride in
to porter to see mr
right you are
hes expecting you in the upstairs study
now if you gentlemen will sign in opens leather bound register turns it toward them surname christian name address nature of business he holds out the pen to them but
they are gone
he looks around in consternation sees them hurrying up the majestic staircase steps out from behind his desk
a huge room with more marble than a mausoleum and just about as lively
a dozen elderly establishment types are sunk deep in the leather armchairs buried behind their copies of the times
holmes and watson are proceeding toward the study
suddenly holmes stops beside one of the old fossils who has fallen asleep in his chair the times in his lap and between his fingers a lighted cigar with an
ash four inches long
holmes picks up an ashtray holds it under the cigar just in time to catch the falling ash
as he replaces the ashtray he scrutinizes the ash
jamaican no doubt either tropical or golosina im not quite sure
he and watson continue toward the study door
it is a very elegant room shelves of leather bound volumes reach to the high ceiling there are antique terrestrial and celestial gloves scientific instruments in polished brass marble busts
of english statesmen
mycroft holmes is standing at a refectory table with his back to the door engaged in a curious operation
a dusty bottle of wine is held in an ingeniously engineered cradle
as he turns the crank the bottle tilts forward gently and he decants the wine into three glasses without disturbing the sediment
mycroft is an impressive figure of a man seven years older than sherlock impeccably dressed
behind his snobbish airs and bantering manner one senses tremendous reserves of strength and authority
the door opens and holmes and watson enter
without turning come in come in sherlock dr
holmes and watson seat themselves youre looking very fit both of you
putting down hat and cane and how are you mycroft
hows your gout
except for the occasional twinge
he brings over two of the glasses of wine to holmes and watson
i have a treat for you a very old madeira
there are only six bottles left in the world
i have two of them and am negotiating for a third
if you dont mind my saying so anybody whos susceptible to gout shouldnt be mycroft has moved back to the table and picked up his glass of madeira
the last doctor who warned me about that was crossing piccadilly slipped on an orange peel and was run over by a delivery van from the fortnum and mason
your very good health
he and watson sip their drinks but not holmes
why are you wasting this precious stuff on us
well i see you so rarely
how long has it been
not since the case of the greek interpreter
to watson isnt it ridiculous
two brothers living in the same town
in the same town perhaps but not the same world
taking another sip mmmm
how old did you say it was
one year before waterloo
one year before waterloo
think of that
you do know where waterloo is dont you doctor
belgium isnt it
turning to holmes and speaking of belgium it has come to my attention that you are interested in the whereabouts of a certain engineer
yes i am
well i can save you a lot of trouble
id be grateful for any suggestion my suggestion is that you pursue it no further
any particular reason
because it involves the national security
we are handling this matter ourselves
the diogenes club of course
i didnt say that
i have always suspected that there was some underground connection between this stodgy and seemingly calcified establishment and the foreign office in whitehall
thats neither here nor there
it seems to me that the diogenes club is here there and everywhere
when there are rumblings of revolt in the sudan an expedition subsidized by your club conveniently shows up to study the source of the nile
when there is trouble along the indian frontier some of your fellow members pop up in the himalayas alledgedly looking for the abominable snowman
a young man in morning coat and striped trousers comes in holding a telegram
mycroft crosses to him
to watson what a fertile imagination my brother has
at the age of five by carefully observing a neighbors house he deduced that babies were brought not by the stork but by the mid wife in her satchel
as good an explanation as any
mycroft has taken the telegram and is coming forward with it
the young man clears his throat
an immediate answer is requested sir
mycroft inserts a monocle in his eye opens the telegram moves toward the desk reading it
tell them that the three boxes go to glennahurich and the red runner goes to the castle
the three boxes to glennahurich the red runner to the castle
very good sir
holmes glances toward the telegram as mycroft puts it down on his desk
catching his look mycroft turns his telegram face down lets the monocle drop from his eye
why dont you crumple it up and swallow it to make sure
my dear sherlock there are certain affairs that do not come within the province of the private detective
they have to be dealt with on an altogether different level
in other words you want me to stay within my limits
i do indeed
speaking of limits what exactly is jonah limited
sherlock when i said drop this case it was not merely a suggestion it was an order
by whose authority
by the authority of her majestys government
i hope ive made myself clear
in his nervousness he drops his bowler which rolls along the floor
now if youll excuse me gentlemen goodbye sir
a pleasure as always
he and watson retrieve their hats move toward the door
to holmes just a minute
picks up holmes cane you forgot your tool kit
he tosses the cane to holmes who catches it
holmes and watson are walking toward b
holmes is whistling loch lomond
you will be gentle wont you when you tell her youre dropping the case
watson what does the word glennahurich suggest to you
and like all scottish names its really a word picture
glen means valley na means of the and hurich if memory serves me means yew tree
youre just trying to impress me
so the three boxes go to the valley of the yew tree
he resumes whistling
they start to cross the street skirting a parked hansom
feeding the horse is the same cabbie who fished gabrielle out of the river and in the passenger seat is von tirpitz the craggy faced prussian we saw before
he stares fixedly after holmes and watson
holmes and watson come up to the door of b and watson fishes his key out
holmes is still whistling
singing along and ill be in scotland before ye
breaks off looks at holmes apprehensively you are dropping the case arent you holmes
open the door
watson turns the key in the lock starts to open the door but is stopped by a chain on the inside
through the opening a revolver appears aiming at them point blank
dont shoot mrs
hudson youre liable to lose two excellent tenants
hudson withdraws the gun unhooks the chain
she is also holding an embroidery hoop
she opens the door and holmes and watson step into the vestibule
oh at last
its been a ghastly experience
did you ever try doing embroidery with a gun in your hand
taking gun from her youll be relieved to know it was not loaded
he starts up the stairs followed by watson
holmes you didnt answer my question
are you planning to disobey mycrofts orders
hes not just your brother you know
youd be defying her majestys government
no reaction from holmes
as they reach the landing gabrielle is waiting for them in the open doorway of their flat
did you find out anything
holmes and watson step inside
lets just say i know what the next step will be
i want you to pack your things
where are we going
holmes let me caution you holmes has put the gun down and is crossing to one of the book shelves
to gabrielle at this evening dr
watson and i are going to take you to victoria station and put you on the boat train
the boat train
well thats better
holmes has taken a railway guide from the shelf and is consulting it
youre sending me back to brussels
is that it
madame valladon you must understand
to holmes agitated i came here to find my husband you were going to help me yes my dear
but circumstances have changed the great detective
well maybe this case is too small for you
on the contrary
its being handled at a much higher level well i wont go back to brussels
maybe youre giving up but im not
tears welling up in her eyes im going to go on looking for him
and nobodys going to stop me even if they try to kill me
looking up from railway guide are you quite finished
if you recall what i said was that were going to put you on the boat train i didnt say you were going to stay on it
holmes and dr
watson will be seen waving goodbye to madame valladon at victoria station
at eight twelve mr
ashdown accompanied by their valet john a glance at watson will appear at euston station and board the highland express to inverness
moving toward holmes thank you
im sorry for what i said
kisses him on cheek thats not necessary
smiling through tears ill go and pack
she hurries off toward watsons room
acidly maybe i should do it since im the valet
holmes replaces the railway guide on the shelf
holmes what exactly are you up to
as you like to put it in your chronicles the game is afoot
but what game
are you really that interested in the belgian engineer
without answering holmes heads for his bedroom
or the wife of the belgian engineer
holmes by this time in his bedroom shuts the door
gabrielle reappears from the other bedroom carrying a glove
you dont like me very much do you
she moves toward the couch
nothing of the sort
quite the opposite
but theres more to this case than meets the eye by this time gabrielle has picked up her parasol from the couch and is obviously searching about
looking for something
my other glove
let me help you
he peers under the couch
gabrielle moves toward the window shakes the parasol opens it a few times
here it is
he comes up from under the couch with the missing glove
she slowly starts to shut the parasol
through the upstairs window of b we see gabrielle shutting the parasol
camera pulls back to include the hansom parked across the street and von tirpitz watching
he signals to the cabbie who is back on his perch
the cabbie flicks his whip and the hansom takes off down the street
the highland express is speeding northward through the moonlit landscape its steam whistle hooting mournfully
the upper and lower berths have been made up in the small gaslit compartment
gabrielles dress is on a hanger but there is no sign of her at the moment
holmes is just pulling a night shirt over his head
you can look now
gabrielles head appears from under the covers of the lower berth
am i embarrassing you mr
not at all
would it surprise you if i told you i once spent the night with women
on a very interesting case in a harem in constantinople
he starts to climb up the ladder to the upper berth
there is the normal complement of passengers men women and children of the middle and lower classes
the only unusual occupants are a group of seven monks in brown habits and cowls
watson in valets livery comes down the aisle proceeds toward a window seat where he has left his umbrella and bowler
the resf of the bench is occupied by monks as is the facing bench
as watson tries to squeeze between them he steps on the foot of one of the monks
sorry father i mean friar or is it abbot
there is no answer from the monk
watson picks up his bowler settles himself in his seat starts to fan himself with his hat
he turns sociably to the monk beside him who is absorbed in his bible
going to scotland you gentlemen
so are we
as he fans himself the ear pieces of his stethoscope which is coiled inside the crown of his bowler dangle down
he quickly shoves them back inside
im a valet
my master and mistress and i are our way to inverness
ever been there
the monk looks up from his bible points to his lips shakes his head
oh forgive me
you must be one of those orders thats taken the vow of silence
trappists i believe youre called
the monk doesnt answer
watson turns away looks out the window but theres nothing to be seen
then he folds bored
he glances casually at the bible in the monks hands
the good book is opened to a page headed jonah
i see youre reading the book of jonah
funny we were just talking about johan this morning
realizes the hopelessness of the conversation breaks off never mind
he pulls down the shade closes his eyes tries to compose himself into sleep
holmes is stretched out in the upper berth which is in darkness
in the lower gabrielle is propped up against a pillow reading a magazine by the light of a gas lamp
other magazines are scattered across her blanket
women are never to be trusted entirely not the best of them
holmes raises himself on his elbow glances down over the edge of his berth
what did you say
i didnt say it you did
according to dr
he gave me some back issues of strand magazine
the good doctor is constantly putting words into my mouth
then you deny it
not at all
i am not a whole hearted admirer of womankind
im not very fond of them myself
the most affectionate woman i ever knew was a murderess
it was one of those passionate affairs at odd hours right in my laboratory
and all the time behind my back she was stealing cyanide to sprinkle on her husbands steak and kidney pie
you mustnt judge all women by of course not
only the ones i was involved with
and i dont just mean professionally kleptomaniacs nymphomaniacs pyromaniacs
take my fiancee for instance your fiancee
she was the daughter of my violin teacher we were engaged to be married the invitations were out i was being fitted for a tail coat and twenty four hours
before the wedding she died of influenza
it just proves my contention that women are unreliable and not to be trusted
a beat good night mrs
he pulls the curtain across his berth
good night mr
she closes her curtain as the train whistle sounds
most of the passengers in the car have fallen asleep in various uncomfortable positions including watson
the monk beside watson looks at him to make sure hes out then rises and moves toward a monk seated apart from the others
in a whisper die spur fuehrt nach inverness
die steigen dort aus
dort muessen wir ihn finded den valladon
the other monk looks up
under the cowl we recognize the face of von tirpitz
the highland express is pulling out of the station
as the last car disappears and the steam clears from the tracks we see holmes gabrielle and watson on the platform
a baggageman is loading their luggage on a hand cart under watsons supervision
lets see two three four gabrielle removes her parasol which has been inserted under the straps of her suitcase
ill take that
to baggageman how do you get to glennahurich
how far is it
you know a valley with a yew tree
gabrielle casually opens her parasol
its about a mile out of town
a beat why would you be wanting to go there
well if its got a view it might be a nice place for a picnic
its got a view right enough but its no place for a picnic
because its a cemetary
gabrielle looks at holmes
camera pans up toward an iron footbridge spanning the railway tracks
moving across it in single file are the seven cowled trappist monks with von tirpitz in the lead
under a leaden sky the yew trees which give the place its name brood over ancient gravestones
holmes gabrielle and watson come down an overgrown path stop and look off
a rather meagre funeral procession is moving along the avenue which runs between the rows of graves
it consists of one normal size pine coffin and two smaller ones loaded on a cart which is being wheeled by a couple of workmen
bringing up behind is a minister with an open prayer book in his hands
a note of excitement the three boxes
is that it holmes
i would think so
the two small ones they must be childrens coffins
holmes starts to cut across between the graves gabrielle and watson following
at the grave site the workmen are removing the coffins from the cart
there is one large grave two smaller ones
a couple of grave diggers stand by respectfully caps in hands
holmes gabrielle and watson come up behind a nearby headstone stop and watch
at the grave site the minister is finishing the service
earth to earth ashes to ashes dust to dust
in sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life through our lord jesus christ
the workmen trundle the cart off the minister following
the grave diggers don their caps pick up their shovels
from their vantage point holmes gabrielle and watson are watching
its so sad
sad and rather odd
there are no flowers and no mourners
the grave diggers have finished filling in the graves when holmes gabrielle and watson come up
looking up morning
working you hard dad
this is healthy country
sometimes you sit around for weeks with nothing to do
then you get three in one day
father and two sons they say they were found floating in the loch
nobody around here knows them
the story is that their boat capsized in a swell but i dont believe it
what do you believe
you may think im an old fool or an old drunk but ive living around loch ness all my life
are you trying to tell us it was the monster
maclarnin saw the kids faces when they were pulled out of the water looked like old men mustve died of fright
last easter sunday my wife and me we were on our way to services when suddenly
but whats the use
he picks up a white washed wooden cross plants it at the head of the grave
the other grave digger has inserted smaller crosses into the other two mounds of earth
taking some coins out of his pocket here you are dad
hands them to the grave digger thank you
you look like nice people
if youre wanting a holiday in scotland go to loch lomond go to holy loch but stay away from loch ness
he and his partner shoulder their shovels move off
snorting to think that people still believe in that nonsense
here we are living in the nineteenth century
im ashamed to admit it but i was relieved when he mentioned a father and two boys
it could possibly have anything to do with emile
it would appear not
however there still remains the clue of the castle and the red runner wherever it may be
they are about to get under way when suddenly holmes stops them
coming down the avenue toward them are four small boys in knickerbockers and caps carrying bouquets of flowers
without a word holmes draws gabrielle and watson back to their hiding place behind the headstone
the four boys approach the freshly filled graves
they remove their caps lay their flowers on each of the two small graves then kneel down and bow their heads in prayer
from their position behind the headstone holmes watson and gabrielle are watching the four boys who have their backs to them
if theyre unidentified graves why are those boys bringing flowers
because its their brothers who have just been buried
and theyre not boys
theyre as tall as theyll ever grow
hand me some pebbles will you
he picks some up from the ground hands them to holmes who tosses them in the direction of the graves
the pebbles strike a granite cross
at the sound the four boys simultaneously turn their heads over their shoulders
despite their slight bodies they have the features of mature men
gabrielle and watson react to the sight
they are how do you say it in english
nodding boys with the faces of old men
i still dont see would it help if i told you they were acrobats
not at all
do you remember a tumbling act six brothers missing from the circus
oh yes that case you turned down i completely forgot
some of us are cursed with memories like flypaper
and stuck there is a staggering of miscellaneous date mostly useless
the four midgets have now risen and putting on their caps move off down the avenue
holmes gabrielle and watson emerge from their place of concealment
holmes is those are not children then
the question now is whos in the third grave
the point of a crowbar digs under the edge of a coffin lid which starts to give with a squealing protest of nails
camera pulls back to reveal holmes standing in the large grave from which the earth has been removed
kneeling beside the grave watching anxiously are gabrielle and watson the latter holding a bullseye lantern
holmes pries the lid open disclosing the corpse of a middle aged man
his arms are folded across his chest and on the third finger of his left hand is a wedding ring similar to gabrielles
from the picture of him we have seen earlier we recognize the face as that of emile valladon
gabrielle lets out a piercing scream collapses in a faint
watson catches her
preoccupied hand me that lantern
watson passes down the lantern and holmes slowly shines the beam along the length of the coffin
it is valladon isnt it
what is not so obvious is why his wedding ring has turned green
the lantern beam now reveals that laid out at valladons feet are three canaries their plumage bleached a grey white color
and why there are three dead canaries in the coffin
an open carriage is proceeding along the driveway toward the hotel scatting a flock of sheep grazing nearby
watson is sitting beside the coachman
holmes and gabrielle are in the passenger seat their luggage is strapped to the back
through the trees which line the road we glimpse loch ness which is partly obscured by a low lying mist
the carriage pulls up in front of the hotel which is identified by a sign above the entrance and holmes watson and gabrielle get out
holmes hand is writing mr
ashdown and valet london
the manager in kilts is just opening the curtains disclosing a view of the mist shrouded lake through the window
the room is on the second floor and is furnished in a style which has been described as scotch baronial twin beds with a night table between them wardrobe chiffonier
desk a couple of chairs and several mounted stags heads
holmes and gabrielle are in the room watson is bringing their bags through the door
you have a lovely view of the loch from here as soon as the morning mist rolls away
crosses to desk picks up guide book if youve a mind to do any sight seeing heres a guide to the local points of interest
the manager starts toward the door nodding to watson
this way please
i will show you to your room
watson picks up his suitcase follows him
the manager and watson come out the latter shutting the door
i suppose youre putting me in the basement
no your room is in the attic
its the privy thats in the basement
watson grunts as the manager leads him up a narrow flight of stairs
holmes removes his coat turns to gabrielle
may i have your wedding ring please
gabrielle tearfully removes her ring hands it to holmes
from his vest pocket he now produces valladons ring the copper has a greenish tinge to it
he crosses to the window compares the two rings in the light
gabrielle sinks down on the edge of one of the beds
just as i thought
there is a distinct difference in color between your ring and your husbands
a sob from gabrielle which leads me to believe that the cause of death was not drowning
gabrielle is now crying i wish you would stop that
crossing to her stop it
i know its not easy
but you must remember that were that nice couple from london on holiday in the highlands
a final sniffle ill try
thats much better
she manages a tentative smile
holmes looks at her for a long moment then gruffly now if i may proceed without further interruptions from off mr
watson comes dashing down the narrow stairs from the attic races toward teh door of holmes room
he flings the door open
watson bursts in breathlessly
i saw it
i saw it from the attic
its out there in the lake
you saw what
looking around desperately the telescope
wheres the telescope
what did you see
watson fishes a small telescope out of holmes suitcase rushes through the open french window to the balcony
watson focuses the telescope on the lake
through the swirling mist which clings to the surface of the lake a shadowy figure with a long monster like neck can be see gliding along
watson almost drops the telescope in excitement
there it is
there it is
holmes joins him on the balcony
look for yourself
he hands the telescope to holmes
gabrielle comes up to the window behind them
holmes trains the telescope on the lake
holmes eye slowly scans the lake but there is no sign of watsons monster just the rolling mist
holmes lowers the telescope
i see nothing
he grabs the telescope from holmes looks toward the lake
maybe it was never there
i swear to you i saw it clear as anything
watson as you so succinctly put it we are living in the nineteenth century he steps back into the room
watson comes halfway through the french window
maybe that grave digger was right the swell and the boat overturning monsieur valladon may have been found in the lake but he did not drown
he died of asphyxiation
holding up wedding rings there is only one substance that can turn a copper ring green and bleach the color out of canaries chlorine gas
that may be
but the fact remains that i saw something out there
a figment of your imagination
now let us be logical
the only concrete lead we have is the reference to the castle picks up guide book from desk opens it to map the question is which castle
you call yourself logical
youre the least logical man i know
how can you say its a figment of my imagination when for years youve been saying i have no imagination whatsoever
he looks at holmes almost triumphantly
holmes gabrielle and watson bicycling away from the hotel
holmes in knickerbockers and a norfolk jacket and gabrielle holding her parasol are on a tandem
watson is behind them on a bicycle with a picnic basket attached to the rack
he is in his valets outfit with metal clips around his trouser cuffs
the three of them bicycling past a long stone wall
they pedal up to an imposing castle
holmes dismounts knocks on the front door
our trio bicycling through a copse of trees
they approach another castle
on a steep road they ride through a flock of sheep
they are proceeding along a causeway away from a third castle
holmes and gabrielle are sitting on a blanket the contents of the picnic basket spread before them having lunch
watson is pouring the wine
their bicycles are resting nearby
we have so far investigated eight drafty castles had our bicycles attacked by sheep and our ears assaulted by bagpipes and we are exactly where we started
to gabrielle would you like some cranberry sauce dear
would you pass the cranberry sauce please john
as he does so he catches sight of something o
calling i say there
on the road above approaching a bridge which spans the lake where it narrows into a stream are the seven trappist monks walking slowly in single file
watson waves to them but the monks pay no attention to him
to holmes some chaps i met on the train
we had a long conversation or rather i had a long conversation because theyre not allowed to talk trappists you know
just study their bibles
youll never guess what the one next to me was reading the book of jonah isnt that odd
looking after the monks quite
as he turns back he notices that gabrielle is manipulating her parasol in the air
what is it dear
whats the matter
she continues to work the parasol alternately opening it and partially closing it
on the bridge von tirpitz who is at the rear of the file of monks glances back toward the lakeshore
on a promontory jutting into loch ness stand the remains of a medieval fortress
around the tower the motte and the ruins of the east wall wooden scaffolding has been erected and a couple of dozen men are engaged in what appears to be
amidst the rubble of the nether bailey an encampment of tents has been set up
holmes gabrielle and watson come bicycling up along a fence on the heights overlooking the castle dismount in front of the locked gates
attached to the gatepost is a sign reading warning no unauthorized person permitted beyond this point
well i dont think we have to bother with this castle
its just a pile of rubble
then why are they taking precautions
she points to the sign and to a guard coming up the driveway with a couple of huge mastiffs on leashes
turning the tandem around lets go
when rebuffed at the front door ones only choice is to try the tradesmens entrance
they move off
holmes gabrielle and watson are coming up a path from the lakeside leading their bicycles
they lean the cycles against a ruined wall start across the courtyard
a middle aged man in kilts emerges from the tumbled down gatehouse comes toward them
no visitors allowed
are you the guide here
the castle is closed to the public while work is going on
what are they doing
its being restored by the society for the preservation of scottish monuments
i particularly wanted my wife to see urquhart castle
the tower is one of the most interesting examples of about wasnt it
let me see was it built under james the second or james the third
if you come back next year well be all done here and ill be glad to show you around
as the three of them move off a canvas topped wagon comes through the stone archway stops at the front of the steps leading to the inner courtyard
pleasant sort isnt he
pleasant but ignorant
he was off one hundred years and one james
taps guide book in his pocket its actually and james the fourth
if hes an official guide shouldnt he know
if hes an official guide
they have now reached the wall against which they left their bicycles
suddenly holmes stops attracted by the sound of birds chirping
do you hear anything watson
those birds are making too much of a racket
looking off theyre not just birds theyre our old friends
watson and gabrielle follow his gaze
from the back of the wagon the carriers have removed the small bird cage we saw in the mail drop on ashdown street
they hand it to a workman who starts up the steps with it
to another couple of workmen they pass down an open sided crate in which rest two heavy glass bottles protected by wicker
stencilled on the wooden slate of the crate are the words sulphuric acid
holmes is watching thoughtfully gabrielle and watson are puzzled
the more we find out the less sense it makes
to a graduate chemist it makes a great deal of sense
sulphuric acid when exposed to salt water produces chlorine gas
a beat would you mind clasping your hands watson
obeying like this
a little lower
watson has lowered his clasped hands and holmes uses them as a foothold to go scrambling up the scaffolding of the nearby wall
reaching the top he looks off in the direction of the tower
the workman carrying the canary cage and the two carrying the crate of sulphuric acid are approaching the tower
a draw bridge comes down and the three men cross the moat and enter the tower
looking off that tower may be more interesting than i thought and not just architecturally
out of the ruined gatehouse comes the guard with the two mastiffs on leashes
the dogs start to snarl viciously
holmes i have a feeling were redundant here
holmes leaps down from the scaffolding wheels the tandem around starts back in the direction from which they came
watson hurries after them with his bicycle casting anxious glances over his shoulder as the dogs continue barking
the sun has just gone down behind the hills but there is still light in the sky
an ominous mist is beginning to settle on the water
gabrielle is sitting in the stern of a rowboat her parasol in her lap
she is wearing holmes norfolk jacket over her dress to ward off the chill
on the rowing seat facing her are watson and holmes the latter in his waistcoat
their oars are pulled in and they are watching urquhart castle on the opposite side of the lake
we have now observed the castle from the front from the back from the side from land from water
are you planning to spend the night out here
youre going to catch your death of cold
to gabrielle wouldnt it be ironic if holmes last case were a case of pneumonia
with an embarrassed chuckle sorry
gabrielle glances past them and her eyes widen
pointing off whats that
holmes and watson turn their heads
about half a mile away moving in and out of patches of drifting mist is watsons monster its long reptillian neck cutting through the water
watson leaps to his feet
holmes grabs his arm pulls him back into his seat
he grabs his oar and watson belatedly joins in
they strain at the oars setting a course which will intercept the monster
gabrielle leans forward in her seat trying to peer past them through the curtains of mist
the monster is much closer now no more than a quarter of a mile away
suddenly watson stops rowing
holmes what are we doing
we should be going away from it
keep rowing dammit
watson resumes pulling on his oar
as they row holmes looks over his shoulder
the monster has started to submerge
its head disappears beneath the surface of the water and the wake it leaves behind soon trails off into the mist
holmes ships his oar
weve lost it
stops rowing at least you admit theres an it not just a figment of my imagination
he listens intently
there is only the sound of water slapping against the side of the boat
the mist is heavier now and billowing around them
to watson do you have your stethoscope with you
never without it
he removes his bowler unwinds the stethoscope from the inside the crown hands it to holmes
holmes plugs in the ear pieces leans over the side of the boat extends the other end of the stethoscope to the surface of the water
what is it
i can hear something
we become aware of the faint beating of engines accompanied by a bubbling sound
its getting closer closer suddenly the surface of the water breaks about twenty yards away from them and the head and neck of the monster rear up from the depths
watson is first to notice it and jumps to his feet making choking noises
gabrielle sees it and screams
watson grabs an oar throws it at the monster as it comes past
the backwash hits the boat broadside rocking it and holmes watson and gabrielle are spilled into the lake
the monster moves away from them heading in the general direction of the castle
it disappears into the mist
holmes is the first to come up looks around sees gabrielle surfacing a few yards away swims to her
are you all right
i lost my parasol
he glances around sees watsons bowler floating nearby swims over to it
he lifts the hat but watson isnt under it
as gabrielle hoists herself into the boat watson clambers over the other side
after a moment holmes joins them and they sit there sopping wet and breathing heavily
i have come face to face with man eating tigers i was once caught in a stampede of wild elephants india you know but i wasnt half as frightened
this beast seems to have a personal grudge against us
i just hope it doesnt come back
i dont think it will
pointing off look
they glance in the indicated direction
there is no sign of the monster
but the mist has momentarily lifted to reveal the castle and an odd sight greets their eyes the wooden scaffolding in front of the tower is slowly rising into the
amazed what strange goings on
my guess is that the monster after a hard days work has returned home for his supper
the scaffolding in front of the tower slowly descends back into the place as mist once more engulfs the castle
holmes in a different suit of clothes is pacing across the room whistling the main theme from swan lake
he stops before the open french window gazes out toward the lake
gabrielle is propped up in bed a blanket drawn up to her chin watching him
watson who has changed into a pair of kilts is standing in front of the fireplace warming his backside
gabrielle glances at watson suppresses a giggle
yes i know
but would you believe that you cant borrow a decent pair of trousers in this place
holmes resumes pacing and watson becomes aware of his whistling
would you like to confide in us
no answer from holmes
watson turns to gabrielle
whenever he starts whistling i know hes getting close to a solution
its nothing new actually
weve come across this situation before
at the ballet
theres a lake and theres a castle and theres a swan that isnt really a swan or in this case a monster that isnt really a monster then what is
what is it indeed that feeds on canary birds and sulphuric acid and has an engine for a heart
the stethoscope is a very sensitive instrument and water is an excellent conductor of sound
there is no doubt that what we are dealing with is a mechanical monster
not only is it equipped with an artificial heart it also has artificial lungs
judging from the bubbles on the surface of the lake it uses some form of air pump
you think my husband was involved in all this
yes madame valladon
im sure of it
but why would anybody build a mechanical monster
just to scare people
not very likely
why did they try to keep me from finding my husband
and why was he buried anonymously
i think i have a pretty good notion of what theyre up to the society for the preservation of scottish monuments better known as the diogenes club
the diogenes club
there is a knock on the door
the door opens and the hotel manager enters holding a magnum of champagne
ashdown i have a bottle of champagne for you
crossing to him a bottle of champagne
i didnt order it
you are to deliver it
these are my instructions
he hands the magnum to holmes
instructions from whom
deliver it where
i wouldnt know sir
but theres a carriage waiting for you downstairs
are you sure you have the right mr
flatly quite sure mr
he turns and exits
holmes taps the bottle of champagne thoughtfully
well watson i would say the curtain is going up on the last act
i dont like the sound of it
please be careful
as holmes starts toward the door watson reaches into his sporran
youd better take this with you
he produces a revolver holds it out to holmes
holmes ignores it exits
a gig is waiting in front of the entrance and leaning against it is the guide we saw earlier at urquhart
holmes comes out carrying the champagne bottle
whos minding the castle
youd better get on
holmes climbs into the gig and the guide moutns the seat beside him
where are we going
some sort of party
you wont be disappointed in the guest list
whos the host
he flicks the reins
the horse starts off at a trot and the gig turns into the driveway
as they drive along holmes glances at the guide who is grim and uncommunicative
the gig with its two passengers proceeds along the lakeshore approaching the entrance to urquhart
a workman is lighting a couple of torches attached to the ruined gatehouse when the gig comes through the archway
the guide reins up the horse in front of the steps leading to the inner courtyard which are now covered with a narrow red carpet
the guide nods to holmes who dismounts starts up the steps examining the red carpet
as he reaches the top he looks off
the strip of red carpet runs across the courtyard lit by torches planted in the ground
a couple of workmen are are unrolling the rest of the carpet toward the entrance of the tower
as holmes passes one of the tents the flap opens and mycroft steps out dressed in his inevitable frock coat
ashdown i presume
turning the red runner i presume
indicates carpet you shouldnt have gone to all this trouble just for me
its not for you
calling into tent mckeller
to holmes may i have the champagne please
handing him bottle not a very good vintage is it
but then again its not for drinking
a black suited man emerges from the ten and mycroft gives him the champagne
tie it up will you
the man moves off toward the tower
mycroft pulls back the flap of the tent
holmes passes inside mycroft following
it is lit by a kerosene lamp suspended from the ridge pole
there are several cots one of them with the bedding rolled up
resting on the stripped cot is a trunk with the name e
valladon painted on it
lying on a table among a group of engineering models are gabrielles parasol and watsons stethoscope
there are also a couple of drafting tables with plans and blueprints tacked to them
holmes moves around the tent taking all this in
interesting and educational
despite my most emphatic warning you persisted in meddling
it would have served you right if youd all drowned
sorry to be so unobliging
stops beside torch e
indicating parasol and stethoscope i imagine this belongs to the pretty lady and this belongs to your valet
we found them floating in the lake
speaking about things floating in the lake how much do you know or think you know
i think youre testing some sort of underwater craft camouflauged to mislead the gullible
i think its an experimental model operated by a crew of midgets
i think it is powered by sulphuric acid batteries and uses canaries to detect escaping gas
altogether a strange contraption
not quite that unique
right now four countries are trying to develop what we call a submersible
but none of them could solve the critical problem how to stay submerged long enough to make it effective
what does the good book say
and jonah lived in the belly of that fish for three days and three nights
that was our goal
and thanks to valladons air pump we got a jump on the rest of them
its a highly complex system of filtration so we had a series of trials and at least one error
during a test run in moray firth pressure caused a leak in the hull
sea water mixed with the acid in the batteries to produce chlorine gas
before they could reach the surface valladon and the crew were dead
so you had them buried in unmarked graves to preserve your secret
it was essential to keep the information from your client
you went to all those lengths to prevent madame valladon from fiding her husband
your client isnt madame valladon its the imperial german government
they were after the belgian engineer or rather his invention
they knew he was employed by us but they couldnt find out where so they enlisted the best brain in england to help them
you my dear brother have been working for the wilhelmstrasse
and madame valladon what part did she play in all this
madame valladon is dead
mycroft crosses to the trunk opens the lid
the germans disposed of her three weeks ago in brussels
this is gabrielle valladon
he hands holmes a small framed photograph
holmes looks at it with apprehension as well he should the picture is of a somewhat matronly woman not the glamorous gabrielle
holmes lowers the photograph
behind it mycroft is glaring at him with customary arrogance
the woman who was brought to your house in the middle of the night apparently fished out of the thames and apparently suffering from amnesia is in fact ilse von
hoffmanstal one of their most skillful agents
am i going too fast for one of the best brains in england
as mycroft continues holmes picks up ilses water soaked parasol and examines it
they planted her on you quite neatly i must admit so that you could lead them to their objective the air pump
very much like using a hog to find truffles
and now perhaps youd care to join me
i am expecting a certain royal personage from balmoral
a coach and escort approach the castle
painted on the door of the coach are the initials v
the entourage enters the castle courtyard and stops
footmen open the door and bow to the lone passenger
waiting on top of the steps outside the tent are mycroft and holmes
lined up on the other side of the torch lit red carpet are half a dozen scientists in their best clothes
out of the coach steps a familiar figure her majesty queen victoria defender of the faith empress of india
she is years old and dressed entirely in black
mycroft comes down the carpeted steps to meet her
the queen extends her hand to him and he touches it
i trust you had a pleasant journey maam
it was long and it was tedious
and it had better be worth our while mr
i can assure you maam it will be
a lady in waiting and a uniformed equerry have now descended from the coach
mycroft leads the party up the steps
now what is this curious ship we are supposed to christen
we call it a submersible maam
it travels under water
what a fantastic idea
they have now reached the top of the steps
maam may present some of the scientists who were responsible for this achievement
ferguson naval architect bowing your majesty
professor simpson our leading expert on hydraulics bowing your majesty
prescott co inventor of the revolving periscope bowing your majesty
and this is sir arthur grisby our authority on maritime ballistics we dont claim to understand any of this
but england is proud of you gentlemen
to think that man can now observe fish in their native habitat trying to correct her well not exactly maam and underwater plants and coral reefs noticing holmes young man
what was your contribution to this project
im afraid it was rather negligible your majesty
to the queen this is my brother sherlock maam
we have been following your exploits with great interest
holmes bows touches the queens extended hand
thank you maam
are you engaged in one of your fascinating cases at the moment
in a manner of speaking maam
when can we expect to read dr
watsons account of the case
i hope never maam
it has not been one of my more successful endeavors
mycroft signals to a bagpiper who starts playing hielan ah the ceremonies are about to begin
to mycroft now where is this underwater ship of yours
pointing to tower in the dungeon maam
what a peculiar place to keep it
turning to the others well let us get on with it gentlemen
mycroft leads the queen along the red runner toward the tower
holmes follows then the lady in waiting and the equerry then the scientists
as they cross the inner courtyard the highland piper falls in ahead of the procession leads them toward the drawbridge
then he steps aside as the royal party crosses the drawbridge and passes through the door of the tower
a high ceilinged rock chamber with a spiral iron staircase leading down
the floor is a concrete ramp the lower end of it covered with water
beyond is the entrance from the loch camouflaged by scaffolding and vegetation
on the upper part of the ramp is a small primitive submarine resting on wheels
prominently lettered on the bow is the name h
jonah and suspended by a rope from the prow is the magnum of champagne which holmes delivered
along the sides are torpedo tubes and fitted over the conning tower is the head and neck of the monster we saw in the lake
present are half a dozen naval personnel commanded by an officer
as the royal party comes down the spiral staircase the officer snaps to attention
mycroft is in the lead followed by the queen holmes the lady in waiting the equerry and the scientists
there she maam
her majestys ship jonah
the four surviving midgets appear on the deck in wool jerseys and navy caps
they start pulling on a chain which slowly raises the detachable head and neck of the monster toward the ceiling disclosing the conning tower and the periscope
and what may we ask is the purpose of that hideous gargoyle
its merely a decoy maam
to frighten away the sharks we imagine
something of the sort
the crew will now demonstrate the workings of the submersible
a sailor of normal height appears on the deck of the sub
the midgets scramble down the hatch
arent they rather small for sailors
but because of the size of the craft the navy made an exception
they should make it a rule
its quite fatiguing to pin on all those medals while standing on our toes
there is the sound of the engines starting
mycroft leads the queen to an open bulkhead in the side of the sub with holmes and rest of the party close behind
inside all is noise and confusion
metal rods are dipping into glass jars of sulphuric acid complicated machinery is driving the propeller shaft bellows are inflating and deflating etc
the midgets are at their stations in the cramped quarters pulling switches oiling the engines operating the periscope
overhead is a cageful of canaries all chirping away
mycroft points out the various features to the queen
this is the main engine which propels it under water at the rate of two knots the stabilizing mechanism the multi stage compressor the ballast tank trimmer the air pump
which filters and recirculates the air
the air pump maam
pointing the canaries
must make the crew feel at home
these are the levers for firing the torpedoes which are accurate up to as much as feet the periscope for scanning the surface of the water but where is the
the what maam
the glass bottom
you know to see the fist and the plants and the corals thats not quite the idea maam
jonah is being commissioned as a warship
waving her hand stop that noise
at a signal from mycroft the sub engines are turned off
maam if i may explain you had better
the admiralty regards this craft as the ultimate weapon in naval warfare
it can seek out enemy ships and destroy them with these torpedoes while remaining completely invisible
you mean in can fire at other vessels while under water
without any warning
that is correct maam
and without showing her colors
holmes we are not amused
mycroft stares at her it is unsportsmanlike it is un english and it is in very poor taste
we will have none of it
i beg your pardon maam
he exchanges a look with holmes
sometimes we despair of the state of the world
what will scientists think of next
thats precisely it maam
at this very moment the germans under count von zeppelin are experimenting with a dirigible
and what pray is that
a rigid balloon which could fly over london and drop a bomb on buckingham palace
it is being developed at the express orders of kaiser wilhelm the second
we refuse to believe that our grandson willie would do a thing like that
we have conclusive proof maam
our agent in friedrichshafen a man named ibbetson actually saw the dirigible and made a drawing of it
unfortunately he was apprehended before he could cross the border
indicating sub nevertheless we dont want any part of this beastly invention
get rid of it
the sooner the better
may i point out maam and dont concern yourself about that dirigible dropping bombs on us
we shall write a very sharp note to the kaiser
to equerry now we wish to return to balmoral
she starts toward the spiral staircase
the equerry precedes her up the stairs the lady in waiting follows the scientists trail after them
mycroft and holmes linger behind
well mycroft it seems we have both been undone by a woman
mycroft is staring at the sub what a shame
all that superb engineering and all that cunning espionage for nought
if the germans want that submersible so badly why dont we give it to them
give it to them
invite them aboard for the final journey seven hundred feet straight down
and how are you going to arrange that
im rather counting on you to do it
since you are on such intimate terms with fraulein von hoffmanstal
the bagpiper resumes playing
shall we say goodbye to her majesty
he starts up the spiral staircase
holmes follows slowly and thoughtfully
the gig with the quide driving and holmes beside him comes up the driveway stops in front of the entrance
holmes hops down and twirling gabrielles parasol in his hand walks into the hotel
in the half light gabrielle can be seen asleep in her bed
she is wearing the pink negligee with the maribou feathers which has slipped halfway off her shoulders
the other bed has not been slept in
the door from the corridor opens and holmes steps in carrying the parasol
he crosses to gabrielles bed looks down at her for a long moment adjusts the negligee with the tip of the parasol
the he moves to the french window opens it glances out
the seven trappist monks are standing on the shore silhouetted against the water watching the hotel
holmes withdraws from the window looks at the sleeping gabrielle then casually swings the parasol hitting a metal lamp shade overhead
gabrielle sits up abruptly in bed clutching her negligee around her
sorry about that
but as long as youre up what is the german word for castle
schloss isnt it
carefully i think so
and how would you say under the castle
unter das schlss
or die schloss
i dont know
my german isnt that good
indicating your trappist friends are out there waiting to hear from you its a chilly morning we dont want to keep them standing around too long do we fraulein hoffmanstal
gabrielle looks at him without answering come now
its too late to play cat and mouse
flatly unter dem schloss
holding out parasol heres your signalling device its a bit damp im afraid would you care to let them know where they can find the submersible
gabrielle makes no move to take the parasol no
then ill just have to do it myself
moving toward window i only hope my morse code is adequate to the occasion
keeping well to one side of the open window he extends the parasol outside opens it starts sending out a series of long and short signals
von tirpitz and the other monks strain their eyes in the direction of the hotel
outside the hotel window gabrielles parasol can be seen flashing the message unter dem schloss in morse code but it is not apparent that holmes is doing the signalling
as holmes continues opening and closing the parasol gabrielle gets out of bed comes up beside him
holmes finishes the message shuts the parasol draws it back into the room
then he looks out the window
the monks turn away from the hotel and with von tirpitz in the lead move off along the shore
holmes steps back from the window faces gabrielle
well its up to the good monks now
you can consider your part of the mission accomplished fraulein hoffmanstal
youre all wrong about me
my name isnt hoffmanstal
its von hoffmanstal
i stand corrected
glancing toward window i suppose once theyre in the castle
it must amuse you mr
holmes trappists walking into a trap
its more amusing than that
once in the castle they will encounter surprisingly little resistance it will take but a small bottle of chloroform to overcome the guards
skeptically you mean youre going to let them have the air pump
better than that
were going to let them have the submersible
they will find it with its engines running all set to go
i assume theyre all expert sailors
and since there is a german battleship cruising off the coast of scotland i expect theyll try to sail it out of the lock and rendezvous at sea
did you say try to
i would suggest you get your things together
mycroft will be here to take you into custody
he opens her suitcase which is on the baggage rack at the foot of the bed
gabrielle watches him for a beat then crosses to the wardrobe starts taking her clothes out
i never had you fooled for a moment did i
you knew right from the beginning when the cabbie brought me to baker street
let me see not quite that soon
he stretches out on the bed
its so funny
i asked for this assignment you know
i was scheduled to go to japan but i couldnt resist the challenge of coming up against the best
im sorry i didnt give you a closer game
youre just being kind
i failed miserably
we all have occasional failures
watson never writes about mine
watson back in his valets outfit again comes bounding down the narrow stairs from the attic races toward the door of holmes room
bright sunlight now floods the room
gabrielle fully dressed is standing in front of the mirror putting on her hat
her packed bag has been set out in the middle of the room and resting on it is the parasol
the door bursts open and watson dashes in
in his haste he trips over the bag goes down
as he picks himself up again gabrielle points toward the balcony
holmes is leaning against the parapet scanning the lake through his telescope
watson appears through the open french window behind him
excitedly holmes i saw it again that thing it came from the castle its out there a trial of bubbles is moving along the surface
suddenly there is a muffled explosion from below and a geyser of water shoots up into the air
holmes slowly lowers the telescope
it was out there
now its gone
look for yourself
there is a great turbulence in the water
up to the surface pops the bottle of christening champagne with rope and ribbons still attached
then a copy of the bible pops up
a bottle of champagne
and a bible
thats all thats left of h
he steps through the window as a puzzled watson lowers the telescope
watson follows holmes in from the balcony
it would seem that somebody carelessly loosened the bolts of the submersible
what a fitting end for trappists now they are resting in eternal silence at the bottom of the lake
to gabrielle do you know what hes talking about
through the open doorway comes mycroft
in the corridor behind him is one of his aides
fraulein von hoffmanstal
im all ready
if theres one thing i like about the prussians its their punctuality
if theres one thing i dislike about the british its their climate
i understand your jails are quite damp and your heating facilities totally inadequate
but youre not going to jail
youre going back to germany
you will be conducted to the swiss german border and be exchanged for one of our agents a man named ibbetson
dont thank me
thank my brother
it was his idea
gabrielle looks at holmes but he avoids her eyes
to gabrielle frankly i think we are making a very poor deal
you much better than most operatives working for british intelligence
turning to holmes dont you agree sherlock
with a small but gallant bow to gabrielle and better than some consulting detectives
mycroft signals to his aide who comes in from the corridor and picks up gabrielles bag
to gabrielle shall we
reaching for parasol ill take that
to holmes and watson gentlemen
she turns and walks out the door mycroft following
watsons bewilderment has now reached monumental proportions
folding his arms all right holmes you dont have to explain anything to me if you dont want to
i appreciate that watson
after all im only your official biographer anyway i dont think shed care to have this story spread all over strand magazine
the public has a right to know these things
if shes a german spy why should we concern ourselves about her feelings
holmes crosses to a small window overlooking the courtyard of the hotel opens it looks out
mycrofts aide comes out of the hotel with gabrielles suitcase loads it into an open carriage waiting in front of the entrance
gabrielle emerges carrying her parasol and accompanied by mycroft
he helps her into the carriage gets in beside her
the aide joins the coachman and the carriage drives off
gabrielle does not look back toward the hotel
holmes is framed in the open window watching the carriage
watson comes up behind him
if i promised not to write a word about it would you enlighten me
as your friend as your valet quiet
im trying to read a personal message
the carriage is moving away from the hotel
gabrielle has her parasol over her shoulder and it opens and closes opens and closes
she continues to signal with the parasol unnoticed by mycroft
watson is straining forward to see out the window
what is she saying
slowly auf wiedersehn
the carriage disappears down an avenue of trees gabrielles parasol still flashing its message
there is snow on the ground and drifts of it piled up along the curbs
traffic is light
householders are shovelling the snow off the sidewalks and pedestrians are hurrying along bundled up against the cold
holmes in his dressing gown and watson in his smoking jacket are at the breakfast table
there is snow on the window sills and a cozy fire is burning in the grate
watson is reading the morning paper
holmes is sorting through his mail
holding up envelope hmmm
a letter from the diogenes club
maybe mycroft is putting you up for membership
if only to have the distinct pleasure of blackballing his brother
he has slit open the envelope
watson watches him curiously as he reads the letter but holmes face remains expressionless
slowly he puts down the letter rises crosses to the window stands there staring out into the wintry street
arent you going to finish your breakfast
holmes doesnt answer
watson takes a lump of sugar out of the bowl with a pair of tongs drops it into his coffee
then glancing over his shoulder to make sure holmes isnt watching he swivels the letter around with the tongs
it is written on diogenes club stationery and reads th december dear sherlock my sources in tokyo inform me that ilse von hoffmanstal was arrested last week by the japanese
counter intelligence service for spying on naval installations in yokohama harbour
after a secret trial she was summarily executed by a firing squad
it might interest you to know that the page ends at this point
watson turns the sheet of paper over with the tongs
the letter continues on the other side
she had been living in japan these past few months under the name of mrs
sincerely mycroft watson looks toward holmes who is still standing with his back to the room gets up from the table
holmes im terribly sorry about this
quietly without turning where is it watson
after a beat in the files
may to july
holmes turns to the bookshelves above the desk
from a row of similar volumes he slides out the three files marked may june and july
actually its the medical bag standing on end with the spines of three volumes pasted on the bottom
youre getting better
he sets the bag down on the desk opens it takes out a bottle of cocaine
watson watches him with compassion as he crosses to his bedroom with his cocaine goes in shuts the door
footsteps are heard hurrying up the stairs and after a moment there is a knock on the door
watson approaches the door opens it to reveal inspector lestrade a short nervous man whose features are sharper than his mind
he is wearing an overcoat his bowler is in his hands and his fingers are drumming on the crown
good morning watson
stepping in just happened to be in the neighborhood and i thought what is it this time inspector lestrade
weve had three rather nasty murders in whitechapel
all ladies of easy virtue
you may read something about it the newspapers are referring to the killer as jack the ripper
yes i think i have
some of us at scotland yard were wondering if perhaps mr
holmes would be willing to a glance toward the bedroom im sorry lestrade
but at the moment holmes is working on another problem
trying to hide his disappointment oh
well i just thought it was the kind of case that might interest him
i dare say we can solve it without his help
oh im sure you will
from holmes bedroom comes the sound of a melancholy tune being played on the violin
watson starts to ease lestrade out of the door
good day lestrade
he shuts the door after him listens to the sound of the violin for a moment
then he crosses to the wicker chair seats himself
he takes some sheets of paper out of the rack and places them on the writing arm dips his pen in the inkwell starts to write
the violin music continues over scene infinitely romantic infinitely sad
