org the following is shot documentary style
a girls volleyball game has just ended
it was a big game
some kind of championship
one team is celebrating jumping up and down squealing and hugging each other
we are focused on the bench of the team trat lost
theyre very sad several are crying
one girl in particular amy is really sobbing
shes sweat stained tired and just blubbering
stuffs coming out of her eyes her nose her mouth and the camera is seeing it all
the coach a fortyish man looks at all the weeping girls amy in particular
you gave up
he kicks a chair
now amy is really a mess
shes crying coughing shaking
right in amys face you quit
the coach storms off
amy is wailing and choking on her own tears
this image freezes
and that would be it
i dont think you need any narration at all
just end it right there
were in new york city
were in the conference room of a modestly successful cable tv station called real tv
the people are young energetic clever
its crowded noisy the furniture is beaten up bulletin boards cover the walls with large index cards all over them
this room is not for show work gets done here
seven or eight people are present
one of them is cynthia reed
shes the boss
to cynthia what do you think
its horrible its depressing i love it
i want to re pitch that pregnancy idea
find six women early in their pregnancies and follow them all right through to the births
negative yeah when all that stuff comes out
mixed reactions mostly negative
i have an idea
this is something ive been thinking about for a long time
were real tv right
i mean thats the name of the station
so lets go real
we find someone
just a regular person someone
and we put their life on television live
all day long
no movement at all
what do you mean like pbs did in the seventies
what was that family
we go way beyond that
we dont film it and edit it and put it on later
we go on the air live every morning and the show goes off each night when our subject goes to bed
in between were on live all day every day the same person for shrugs lets say a month
no one is wild for this
some hate it some are unconvinced
thats not a show thats a surveillance camera
you cant do that
the hell we cant
look the beauty of being a cable channel is we can take chances
ive thought about this and im telling you i think this can make a noise
a loud one
there are twelve thousand channels
youve got to do something that says look at me
hell people look at fish tanks all day
this is people
more firmly someones real life an tv all day long live
and you know what
im doing it
the others know the argument is over
in that case we love it
a bus passes
on the bus is an ad
it says would you like to star in your own tv show
call real tv and a phone number coming and a date
this is a nice upscale pool hall
a party is in progress in a special private area a room upstairs lets say a loft
thirty or forty people in their twenties and thirties are informally celebrating the engagement of two of their friends
its noisy its fun its informal
its not a high end group
by that we mean not for the most part young lawyers or stockbrokers
theyre mostly blue collar
community college graduates
we open on ed pekurny
hes an attractive man about thirty
theres still something a little juvenile about him not stupid just boyish
someone is videotaping him for one of those congratulation montage things that are done at parties these days
ed is good at this
hes not professional but hes a loosey goosey guy whos kind of good on camera
i want to congratulate kevin and tracy on their engagement
i knew you guys were meant for each other from the moment tracy told us she was pregnant
everyone else is cracking up
what did i say
my mothers going to see this
other people are being interviewed on tape
ed is shooting pool with his buddy john
johns had a couple of drinks
hes a little melancholy
he is looking across the room thoughtfully
look at this people are getting married theyre getting married
you said that
were falling behind
ed waves dismissively
you know who we are
were the guys who clean up after the parade
im gonna stick this right in your eye
i was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says if youre over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag you screwed up your
and im laughing and then i realize i wear a nametag
so do i
im doing all right
your brothers here
eds brother ray and rays girlfriend shari arrive at the party
shari is pretty in an unglamorous kind of way
they both wave and then shari goes off to talk to some of the ladies and ray joins ed and john
where were you
reluctantly i was
having dinner with shari and her parents
im telling you its closing in on me
all of a sudden its like a thing its a whole thing
what do you mean all of a sudden
youve been going with her six months
i mean im sitting there and her fathers asking me about my career prospects and im playing risk with her kid brother leon and at dinner the dogs sniffing at
my balls at least i hope it was the dog
cause her mother disappeared for a while
its getting wild
some of the girls are dancing raucously
ed ray john shari and maybe another woman
ray is holding a big tray of shrimp balls
during the conversation ray throws them in the air and catches them in his mouth like popcorn
once he even bounces one off the wall into his mouth
you know those are for everybody
ray waves dismissively then gets an idea
to shari show them that thing you can do
to the others this is great
i just found out she can do this her brother told me
to shari come on
thinks its stupid i dont come on
she hesitates but she really doesnt mind
slightly amused she takes her fist and fits it completely into her mouth
ray is cracking up
is that unbelievable
she removes her hand
and that concludes todays show
to ray this is where you go around and collect the money
ray gives her a kiss
sharis roommate rita sits down
you guys know my roommate rita
they do vaguely
whats going on over there
everybodys making audition tapes for that real tv thing
oh that thing
did you hear about this
not sure yeah what they put some schmuck on tv all day long or something
you know that would be like a great thing
being that guy
being the guy they watch
what are you drunk
yeah but lets stay on one subject
whoever that person is is going to be famous
theyll be able to get whatever they want
trust me this is my business
youre in show business
i service video equipment
those people stitching nikes in panama saying theyre in the nba
insulted im not stitching nikes in panama
im making a tape
ed and shari waiting for drink orders
so ray met the family
i hear the dog really liked him
oh the whole family loved him
of course they loved the last guy i went out with and he strung me along for three years and dumped me
you see to me you shouldnt have any trouble with men
there should be like a line behind you
she takes eds beer
you shouldnt drink
ed and shari arm wrestling
after a struggle ed wins
ed is impressed
shari wrings out her arm and picks up her beer
continuing a previous conversation and you know every guy i ever broke up with the minute it was over i could tell you what went wrong how it went wrong
why it had to go wrong
but when im in it
im like a love coroner
bring me the corpse i tell you what killed it
but how to prevent it
they walk over
to camera hi
im ray pekurney
im from paramus new jersey
shes watching rays tape
ray thinks hes funnier and cuter than he is
all my friends tell me ray youve got too much personality for one guy
its like at a party im at the center of the attention
everybody loves me
he gets hit in the face by a hors doeuvre
ha ha ha
ill kick your ass
no really let me show you my girlfriend
shes really cute
he reaches out and grabs sharis wrist
shari is struggling to stay out of frame
we just see her arm and ray pulling on it
ray lets go
shes strong cause shes a fedex girl
she lifts those packages
but shes not dikey at all shes really pretty
we see the camera shooting an empty space
then eds head appears sideways right in front of the camera
hello im ed
he starts to sniff
he steps back from the camera and straightens his head as he sniffs
hes more relaxed than ray
what is that smell
oop i think its this idea
one person on tv all day long
screams are you nuts
the real tv staff are enjoying eds tape while they eat lunch out of styrofoam containers
seriously get your resumes in order
when my brother ray whose personality you were just dazzled by told me he was going to try out for this i said why in the world would anyone want
to be on tv all day long no privacy everybody knowing your business exposing every single detail of your life i mean
why would anyone want to do that
but then i thought of a reason
loudly why the hell not
he kisses the lens smudging it
cynthia watching cracks up
the others seem to like him to
this is a video store in paramus new jersey
people are in line to check out tapes
we open on a woman a mother who is rummaging through her purse for her blockbuster card
she looks up and sees that her two children have opened several boxes of candy from the candy display and are eating from the boxes
oh for put those oh god
she grabs the boxes from them
the boxes are ripped more than she thought and candy goes flying all over
she bends to pick it up
he works here
to the mom we take care of it
someone arrives with a broom
to the broom guy here
this time throw it out dont eat it
lou the manager passes
lou can i talk to you a second
lou seems like hed prefer to avoid this
um yeah i was gonna
whats the deal
did anybody make a decision ed look uh
youre not getting the job
theyre gonna transfer someone from another store to manage this store when i leave to manage the new store
did you go to bat for me
you batted or you bunted
i went as far as i felt comfortable
i mean you know lets face it you come and go here as you please
you work when you feel like it you know bruce springsteens birthday is not a legal holiday
well then im quitting
ed come on
whats that gonna do
youre gonna bring blockbuster to their knees
let me recommend a movie to you
its called get your shit together before its too late
wise ass whos in it
ed goes to the phone
into the phone yeah
are you serious
come on no kidding who is this
ed is being interviewed by the real tv staff whom we met earlier
hes slightly less comfortable than on his tape but hes good
i had one year of college
and then one year of junior college
what did you study
oh see studying wouldve been a huge help
where were you then
well theres ray my brother
like a few years ago he started this mobile dog grooming business
but like out of his camry
he had this bathtub in his trunk ed starts cracking up hes throwing the dogs in there theyre fighting and splashing then hed slam the trunk down let em run
around inside screaming getting all wet
then hed use the car exhaust to dryem
wiping his eyes ah ray
he just cant get a break
my sister marcia i mean she cant get a break
about seven years ago she falls in love with this vietnamese guy who wants to marry her so he can stay in the country
so they get married they have a kid he gets his citizenship immediately divorces my sister and marries this vietnamese woman who he was probably already married to all along
she can pick em
pause shes got a nice little boy though
my nephew andy
my moms okay
i knew a guy who hated his mother stuey shwam
he hated his mother so much he had his belly button removed
no ive never been married
the interviewer seems to be waiting for him to elaborate
he shrugs thats it
oh my father what an asshole
when i was twelve my mother needed a hysterectomy my father ran off with her nurse
and thats the last i heard of him
al my stepfather hes opinionated
and you have to listen because hes like in a wheelchair
i like my job i mean im doing all right
im not sure how long i want to stay there you know
i mean im thirty one
im not sure i want to be a video store clerk when im forty
of course i didnt expect to be doing it til i was thirty one either
you know im
keeping my options open
anything comes along im ready to pounce
growls like a cougar a dream
of course i have a dream i just dont know what the hell it is
shrugs and smiles eds image freezes while he has a funny cute expression on his face
pull back to reveal a tv in a conference room with eds frozen image on it
cynthia is there with her bosses the people who run the network that owns real tv
the top man is mr
his deputies are ms
seaver and mr
this is not the same place where we met cynthia and her staff
this is richer more corporate and formal
hes who we want to go with
doubtfully this guy
i polled my staff
the men say theyd hang around with him and the women say hes fuckable
and one of the men said hes fuckable
im not sure about the entire concept
cynthia is frustrated
look its not like were burning up the airwaves now
were running neck and neck with the gardening channel
if people just tune in to this twice a day for five minutes were a hit
plus we can sell advertising every second running at the bottom of the screen
and the beauty is this guy doesnt even have to be good
i mean if hes good great
but if he winds up making an ass of himself better
mcilvaine how is that better
people cannot turn away from an accident
you drive by you say ooh i hope theres not a head lying in the road but you look
see nobody in america wants to be nobody
this guy wants to be famous
so basically the deal is he agrees to drive down the highway a hundred miles an hour blindfolded and we get to see if his head winds up rolling down
fun for the whole family
so lets do it
she stops waiting for approval
coldly good luck
eds re stocking the shelves he gets goosed from behind very loud and happy hey
ed drops the boxes
ray is there with shari
i got your message
way to go
to ray lets go in the stockroom
ed and ray enter
so when do you start
im not gonna do it
look theres a million ways to humiliate yourself i gotta think of a new way
i mean its all day
id be like a monkey at the zoo
disgusted oh man
they couldnt pick me
they had to pick you
he slaps a tape off a shelf
you would do this
you would actually in a second
in a hot second
let me ask you something why do you do that
whenever you ask me something why do you always say let me ask you something
why dont you just ask me
impatiently all right
let me ask you something
are you happy like this
im doing all right
whats your master plan here
shari enters curious about the yelling
she stands there quietly unnoticed by the guys
youre gonna be a video store clerk for the rest of your life
this is your big ambition rearranging the ernest movies
how many opportunities are you going to get in your life
i dont know
you dont know
doors dont fly open for guys like us
you know were not the same
i got a good life this job suits me
i come and go when i please oh dont bullshit a bullshitter
if youre happy like this youre an idiot and youre not an idiot
sees shari hi
ed turns and sees shari
shes self conscious
she feels like shes been caught eavesdropping
i i heard ray yelling
didnt mean to to ed give me a chance
im begging you
i need a break
look i cover your ass
i ride shotgun
just bring those cameras over to me and i make something happen for both of us
come on eddie pause
ray lifts ed up
ray kisses ed
to shari is this guy a brother
moderate priced restaurant
we open on a close up of al
hes about seventy
what happens when you go to the bathroom
do they go in with you
ed ray al jeanette and marcia
al is in a wheelchair and has an oxygen mask connected to a tank
he periodically takes a hit of oxygen
hes a little short of breath but loves to talk
jeanette is eds mother about sixty
marcia is a little older than ed
the bathroom is off limits and when i go to sleep they go to other programming
unless i get up
then they go back on the air
unless i get up to go to the bathroom i guess then what if youre vomiting
amazed by the question what if im vomiting
do they show it
i guess i dont its all in the contract
theres this million page contract look can we all just sign the releases so we can get on with this
accusing to ed what happened
you described this crazy kooky family whod be a million laughs on tv
i barely even mentioned its just that my friends the people at work whoever im regularly in contact with they want releases from
angrily theyre gonna mock our foibles
our foibles our foibles
we dont have foibles
everyone has foibles
then the whole country sees them on tv and mocks them
then we have
eddie please dont let them mock our foibles
losing it stop saying foibles
look my life is not so great that i want it shown on television
and neither is yours
thats the point this could change things
me and my friend bucky are buying out my boss
his equipment trucks client list the whole shmear
points to ed what does that have to do with
if they keep ed on for one full month he gets a balloon payment
i borrow against that now at the bank
buy the business
and ed becomes a silent partner
now heres the beauty part
while were on tv i plug the shit out of the business
how about sex
a stunned pause
they all look at al
i have to pass al
and its not an age thing no
do they show you having sex
kissing and hugging okay but if its actual sex they have to cut away
at what point
at the point i dont look youd be on tv maybe one or two times each
i try to avoid i go out of my way to avoid getting together with you
we hear a loud drilling sound
a workman is drilling a hole in the wall
ed is there with a tv crew
theyre running cable and drilling holes and examining the apartment
cynthia is going around supervising
ray and shari are there
ray is fascinated
ed is tense
shari is observant
ray separates from ed and shari and asks one of the installers a technical question
ed joins cynthia
are you sure about this
hey believe me know ive got a great chance of making a fool of myself here
why do it
i saw this show once
it was about logging
i was home sick there was nothing else on
do you know how they break up really bad log jams
you know when theyre really tangled
so maybe this is my dynamite
dynamite is dangerous
ed can i see you a second
to shari excuse me
okay so you understand
were installing a permanent camera in your bedroom one in the kitchen one in the living room plus of course therell always be a couple of steady cams following you
i want you to take this
she gives him a card
that has my work number my home number my pager number
i sleep three hours a night
call me whenever you want to talk
off the air on the air whenever
barely listening um yeah thanks
ed looks kind of overwhelmed
she doesnt like this
dont freeze up on me
i picked you because you had kind of a relaxed go with the flow quality
youre not going to lose that are you
i bet my career on you
youd better be good
annoyed dont say that
telling a guy before you have sex youd better be good
you dont do that
hes in bed watching tv
the news is on
he glances up at one of the cameras
on the news they go to a story about him
tomorrow morning the cable channel known as real tv begins broadcasting one of the most heavily promoted concepts in the history of cable television
in an experiment that they say will last at least a month
theyre going to follow live every waking minute of a thirty one year old video store clerk from paramus new jersey
the real tv press release on this promises that none of it will be scripted none of it will be edited and in my opinion none of it will be
were all just supposed to sit in front of our tvs and watch this guy
rhymes with give to the entertainment reporter what would be the interest here
get people to tune in
i dont know
i might check it out
well lens here to check out sports
len would you watch this video clerk
id sooner watch soccer
they all cruckle
shes watching the same show
shes cracking her knuckles
speaking of disasters at the meadowlands tonight
the set goes off
ed once again stares up at the camera
written on the screen day one
a director and technical crew with all the modern equipment
here we go
ten nine eight seven cynthia and her staff are gathered to watch the show begin theyre tense and excited
a commercial is on
on the tv the commercial ends and the real tv logo appears
it says the following is unedited unscripted and unrehearsed
it is the real life of one american citizen named ed pekurny
the logo fades away and we see ed in bed sleeping
his alarm rings and he wakes up
hes groggy from sleep
instinctively he begins scratching his balls
as he does it hits him that this is not a normal morning
he looks up and sees two steady cam guys at the foot of his bed aiming their cameras at him
ed then looks at his hand on his balls
gently he moves his hand away
mock cheerful well were off to a great start
note the camera operators will change in shifts
we see about four regulars over the course of the film
the one we will see most often is shooting ed right now
his name is ed wearing shorts and a t shirt gets out of bed
his hair is sticking up
he passes a mirror and notices his hair
he turns to the camera and seems about to offer an excuse for his appearance but then just moves on
he grabs some clothes and enters the bathroom
theyre not enjoying this
everyones staring at cynthia
she doesnt flinch
note silent advertising runs along the bottom of the screen
ed enters dressed and showered
the steady cam is in his face
ed is tight
hes much less comfortable than he expected to be
he smiles stiffly at the camera
hes misplaced his natural charm
he gets a box of pop tarts out of the freezer
as he does other stuff falls out of the freezer on to the floor
he bends down to pick things up showing his ass to the camera
to cynthia start clearing a place for your emmy
ed is sitting up on the kitchen counter eating his pop tarts and a bowl of cereal
nervously same people like to put the milk in first and then the cereal
i like to put in the milk first i mean the cereal first and then the milk
yeah thats it
now watch this
he takes a knife and a banana
he peels the banana
he holds the knife blade up over the cereal and chops down on it with the banana several times rapidly slicing it into the cereal
hes proud of this
ray is watching the show
his head is in his hands
hes horrified by how bad ed is
jeanette and al watching ed
being positive so far
somebody shoot me
scharlach seaver and mcilvaine watching grim faced
cynthia is on the phone
get him out of the house
i want him moving
on the phone hey i want him dead but what can i do
ed is eating
he peers confused at the camera
theyre signaling ed to get out
bewildered imitating their gestures
you want me to swim
the director is still on the phone
shes watching ed on a monitor
ed gets it
you want me to go out
ed exits the building with the operators walking backwards in front of him bumping into people people watch curiously
ed reaches his car
he takes out his keys and drops them in a muddy puddle
disgusted he fishes them out
scharlach watching impassively
ed in the car
he can barely fit the key into the ignition
carlos in the passenger seat taps him on the arm
ed looks up
carlos holds up a hastily made sign
this does help ed
he appreciates it
we see the control truck in motion
we also see another car with another steady cam operator shooting eds car as they travel
ed is doing his morning errands
a little shopping a little banking always on camera
at one point he walks into a glass door with the word pull on it
he pushed banging his forehead
a child points to the word pull
ed turns to the camera embarrassed
later he buys a slice of pizza at a little place thats doing no business
to the camera best pizza in new jersey
as he walks down the street people call out hey ed
people in windows show him that theyre watching him at that exact moment
the camera shoots some of the people in the windows
they see themselves on tv and they go wild
ed also is confronted by guys grabbing their crotches mockingly calling out things like hey ed holding your own
or hey ed howls the grand ballroom
ed is slightly chagrined by all this but handles it with good grace
he seems to be loosening up
ed arrives at work
the store is already open
ed usually gets there in the afternoon and stays until closing
customers are a little stunned by the arrival of a camera
some know what its about some dont
the clerks are aware of whats going on
they all signed releases
eds boss greets him stiffly
clearly hes trying to get face time on camera
stiffly welcome to work ed
he shakes eds hand and smiles at the camera
he waves a little
the broom guy crosses staring transfixed at the camera
he blocks ed and lou
he freezes then panics
he tries to get out of the way and trips over his broom
he tumbles face first into the camera lens hurting himself
angle on ed observing
mutters oh jesus im dying
carlos give him some air give him some room
use a longer lens
we mostly go with the stationary cameras in here
to the crew in the truck sarcastically have any of you thought about your next career
a woman is serving dinner
shes watching ed on tv really just glancing at it
her husband is helping her bring the food to the table
why are we watching this
a little guilty no reason
i just want to see what happens
nothings gonna happen
oh come on they wouldnt put it on if nothing was gonna happen
he changes the channel
she changes it back
he doesnt get it at all
rapid cuts of various people around america watching a couple a young guy a woman alone ending with a few college age girls in what appears to be a dorm
one girl is watching intently
her roommates are mostly just hanging around not really watching
i think hes cute
one of her roommates glances over to see what shes so excited about
ed is walking
he passes the little pizza place he touted earlier
theres a line out into the street
the storeowner is working hard deliriously happy
ed passes oblivious to what hes created
the camera operator is shooting ed in the bathroom clipping his some guys work from the big toe down to the little toe
i save the big one for last

makes a disgusted noise ray and shari watching ed
ray is banging his head on the table
this is not working

scharlach i know they shoot horses

hangs up she immediately regrets her outburst
written on the screen day two
open on turtles racing as only turtles can across the floor
the turtles have little plastic men seated on their backs
the crowd cheers and screams for their favorite turtles

ed comes outside and hes accosted by a group of angry polish americans many of whom are carrying signs decrying polish jokes and anti polish attitudes
they scream angrily when they see ed
ed is completely shocked
he runs back inside
he locks the door leaving carlos outside
the demonstrators attack carlos
ed is at his kitchen table with several burly demonstrators arrayed behind him
ed is nervously reading from a sheet of paper while carlos shoots
my polish acrobat remark was ill considered
although i meant no harm i should have recognized that such trouble with the next word stigmatizing remarks bring pain and anguish to
hes having trouble reading the next word
i cant read my own writing

chinese is im sure a beautiful language and they write
its not chinese
he wipes sweat away

she hurts ed
she drops her tools
near hysterics can i have some room please
talking with the suction in his mouth gi hu roo
its an educational type panel discussion involving various eggheads and pundits
its called viewpoint
lets change topics for a moment
does anybody have a viewpoint on something going on now called ed this i believe is a new low point in american culture
what it reveals is the absolute creative bankruptcy in the television business
what theyre saying basically is were giving up
we have no ideas
its worse than that
they dont select someone with any talent or with something to say they seem to celebrate the fact that this guy is a boob
its a joyous celebration of boobery
i think weve already spent far too much time discussing this
they all agree
open on ray with chopsticks up his nose imitating a walrus
also he has lo mein noodles protruding from between his lips
ed is forcing a smile
ray is wearing a tee shirt that says ray and bucky video kings with a phone number
cynthia is alone working late
shes watching ray
shes not enjoying him
ray dont throw the shrimp youre gonna choke again
choke to death you boring bastard
ed is sitting up in bed wearing shorts and a tee shirt eating directly out of a cereal box
the audience likes you when youre moving
try not to stay in one place too long
get outside as much as you can
also we have some notions
have you thought about becoming a big brother
or coaching a little league team
how about a date
are you asking me
no i mean
its just the ratings are still soft
nervously are you going to cancel me
lets not worry about that vet
youre testing well
theres another problem
what about ray
well the walrus impression delightful as it was is just not wowing the audience
this is some audience research
he hands ed a printout
ed doesnt know how to interpret the figures
what does this mean
it means they hate his freaking guts
it means if he were on fire they wouldnt put him out
trying a little too hard ed the audience can smell the desperation coming through the screen
see him a little less often
how much less
never would be plenty
i cant do that to him
hes pushing a little too hard but
i just cant do that to him
he be fine
ed is driving slowly on a busy street
suddenly an eighteen year old boy lands heavily on eds windshield
ed is badly startled
he cant see
he swerves and stops
the boy is not hurt
hes banging on the windshield waving at the camera
ed furious gets out
im on tv
im on tv
ed just stares in disbelief
ed is walking
people yell at him
your show stinks
the guy laughs like he really got in a good one
ed ignores him
two teenagers run in one has a camera and quickly snaps a picture of ed and the other guy
merrily they shake his hand and run off whooping
there are people who trail along
many of them will show up again and again throughout the movie following ed
some of them will look mentally or emotionally impaired
quick shots of ed with customers one or two show a bit of camera consciousness
a little group has gathered to observe eds show
ed rings the bell
to the camera this is rays apartment
rays got a big screen tv and the knicks are playing in l
tonight so sometimes i come over after i work late and we watch the game here
he makes funny comments
hes really a good guy
who is it
its me ed
the door opens a crack revealing ray in a bathrobe
rays look is unwelcoming
you watching the ballgame
uh no uh im a little tired
i fell asleep
i watch at home then
ray where do you keep the glasses
oh is shari here
why didnt you just say so
why are you giving me a song and dance about being tired
calls out hi shari
whos ray looks pained
ed realizes whats happening and freezes rays phone rings
he turns to answer his phone allowing the door to swing open a little
ed can see into the kitchen
he sees a woman wearing just panties facing away from him searching for glasses
into phone hello
to the camera wed better go
rapid cuts of viewers loving this some screaming dont go
dont leave stay etc
into phone no honey its not what it looks like she hangs up on him
he holds his head
ed is tip toeing away
he stops when ray calls him
ray runs out into the hallway after him
they speak with lowered voices
that was shari
she saw the whole thing on tv what is this
whats going on who is that
embarrassed its the receptionist at one of the places i service video equipment shes very pretty and you know she never even talks to me and then today i come

she picks up the phone

the camera operators are vigorously nodding and mouthing yes go
ray is oblivious to this but ed picks it up
she you know control herself
if i go over there shes just gonna slam the door on me
just go over and beg her to talk to me thats all
you owe me for this
ed accepts the irony of rays attitude without comment the door opens revealing rita sharis roommate
shari knew you were coming over because she saw
right yeah apologetic she really doesnt want you and the camera in here right now
no i understand
thats where is she is she all right
rita isnt sure how much she should reveal
gave her a drink
i thought it
but shes not much of a drinker so its made her a little
shari appears in the doorway over ritas shoulder
shes holding a liquor bottle and shes a little drunk
what do you want
awkward shari im just really sorry
look i know this is
unbelievably awkward but if i could come in for like a second and you know just say
two words then
shari indicates with her head that ed can come in
ed and carlos enter
rita shuts the door
shari crosses to a couch
ed indicates for carlos to give them some distance
dont lose them carlos
this is gold
stay out of their way but get everything
carlos settles across the room
he rests the camera down as if hes not even shooting but hes still guiding it where he wants it throughout the scene
im gonna go to bed
to shari you okay
she gives the camera a quick glance
quickly with a small wave hi mom
she exits shari ray feels starting to cry dont defend that horses ass to me
im just look you know in a way its good
he got this out of his system now and he knows its not worth it and you know someday if you guys got married or something ha
poking ed as she talks ive got news for you i never intended to marry him
ray watching on tv
well for one thing hes a bad lay
his eyes bulge out and he begins to gasp
rapid shots of viewers reacting whoa
the college girls applauding
one of them screams tell it
ed realizes that rays been called a bad lay on television
oh my god
directly into the camera i mean bad
look not having been there
i just think youre hurt and youre saying this to you know get back at him
she starts to cry
whether you get back together or not youre too terrific a person to
lower yourself like this
ray still in shock
i mean i told ray a couple of times that i thought you were one of the best and
most attractive women ive ever seen so
in comforting her hes gotten his face very close to hers
same dorm girls as before
she tilts her head forward a little hesitates then kisses him at first warmly then passionately
the girls are going wild screeching
im nuts hah
i knew it
he dials the phone
john is stunned
he stares amazed
the woman he was found with appears behind him
i found the snapple
she sees the kiss
scharlach you schmuck
i am the golden goddess of television
she begins beating her chest one fist at a time while she screams in triumph
shari and ed have stopped kissing
they both look stunned
shari is suddenly sober
oh my god
she looks at carlos who has now moved closer to them oh my god
okay i kissed my boyfriends brother on television

he and carlos exit
going through the door he gives carlos a little push then quickly steps back inside slams the door and locks it

a womans signing for it
this is so exciting
a real celebrity delivering my figs
uncomfortable sign here please
that ray was a pig
ed is doll

on tv you look a little washed out
what would i actually have to do to get you to sign this
insulted oh an tv a minute and already an attitude
annoyed by the x
thats were two lines cross forming an x
angrily the woman signs and slams the door
she heads back to her truck
she looks up and ed is there with flowers
the tv cameras are there also
shari is startled
but shes also glad to see him
what are you doing
i missed you
shes camera shy
you know i never saw you in your uniform before
they both laugh
its really a tremendous turnoff
you should see the one we wear when it rains
sunday night at the devils game im driving the zamboni

shes shy but she really likes ed
he likes her and is very sweet to her
ed and shari some place like tavern on the green

this makes shari laugh and relaxes her
close up of ed driving the zamboni
hes loving it
he waves to shari
shari in the stands watching
she waves and smiles
the ice a wider shot
the zamboni is basically out of control
carlos is sliding along the ice shooting ed as the zamboni zig zags dangerously eventually crashing into the boards shattering the plexiglas
its very crowded
ed and shari enter just to see the show
the crowd which is already fired up by the music sees them
it starts out okay people crowding around patting ed on the back
a chant begins ed ed ed
pretty soon it drowns out the music
more people press towards ed
its too crowded dangerous
shari is swept away from ed
shes buffeted about violently
she goes down
ed cant move
the crowd is friendly and happy but the effect is scary
bouncers squeeze ed and shari out the door protecting them
ed is unnerved
shari is somewhat bedraggled
her clothing is torn
ed is on the phone
they tore her dress

but americas latest craze is a guy named ed
here with that story is entertainment reporter rick douglas
pat four weeks ago no one in america had even heard of ed pekurny
today this thirty one year old video store clerk has become something of a national obsession
the words viewers use to describe him are charming natural and appealing
and ratings indicate that ed tv is being watched by more people each day than any show in the history of cable television
a shot of scharlach being interviewed
a caption identifies him
this idea just came to me
i told my staff if people just tune in twice a day for five minutes were a hit
sometimes you gotta go with your gut feeling
sure it came to you
because i brought it to you
raises her fist you want a gut feeling
how about a groin feeling
raises her foot ed tv has become so popular that when ed goes to sleep real tv is running highlights of eds day all night
some viewers have become obsessed with ed
they wake up when ed wakes up they go to sleep when ed goes to sleep and in between they try to watch as much of him as possible
casually yeah i watch it

goddam pineapple brothers
the same eggheads who earlier had no interest in ed
now theyre all worked up
but hes not a normal person anymore
hes a celebrity
were no longer observing anyones real life
disagreeing but thats whats interesting
the effect of celebrity on an otherwise average person
but do you really feel that ed is an average person
i mean this guy seems to have a
magnetism a charisma that i think transcends the entire concept
they all nod
ed is opening letters and packages
there are piles of them this is from a girl named tawny
this goes in the nude picture pile
thank you tawny
he places it in a large pile
he opens another envelope
ed stares and his smile disappears
a picture of eds face with his body drawn underneath it
the body is spurting blood and is mutilated
ed stares at it
this is creative
this goes in the psychopath pile
the doorbell rings
oh i hope thats not this guy
indicates psycho letter he picks up a baseball bat and crosses to the door
he opens the door
a handsome man in his early sixties is there

jeanette is putting a jar in the refrigerator
she glances at the television
she drops the jar
marcia is with her half asian son andy
shes serving his dinner
off camera we hear cliff singing and the dog howling in distress
glancing at the television marcia gasps
ray is typing on a word processor
he stares curiously at the television
ed is staring at hank doubtfully
its me hank your father
rapid cuts of viewers excited
many of them reach for the phone
the real tv staff react
cynthia looks over stunned
to cynthia did you do this

oh this just keeps getting better
written on the screen day ed and his mother are arguing
al is sucking oxygen and has a pile of people magazines with ed on the cover
a repairman is fixing the refrigerator
all their food is out and melting
jeanette is trying to preserve food in an ice chest while she argues with ed
i cant believe youre taking his side
im just trying to get some facts
to ed sign this one to nancy
shes the nurse who handles my urine
i told you the facts
he abandoned us those are the facts
so everything he told me yesterday was a lie
al takes a loud breath
practically what do you mean practically
did he really run away or did you throw him out like he says
i need to replace the coil
to ed he ran away after i threw him out
to repairman how much is a new coil
a hundred and fifty bucks
so he was telling the truth you threw him out
should i go ahead
yes to me or yes to the coil
holy sh this one to dr
maybe he wont make me wait an hour
he had girlfriends
he says i dont care what he says
look i dont need to relive this
whatever happened to norman rockwell
he painted magazine covers
a mailman a boy scout a kid visiting a doctor
they celebrated the common person
well i dont think you can get more common than me al
only celebrities now
now if you put a mailman on the cover of a magazine hed better have killed someone or no one will buy it
this one to dr
jeanette storms back in
all right do you want to know the truth
i took you and marcia and ray to my sisters on the train for the weekend and you all got chicken pox
so i took you home a day early and there was your father with a woman in our bed
i was six
he didnt leave til i was twelve
apologized he begged me
he can be very
charming when it suits his purpose
but what was that whole story about him and a nurse
she couldve been a nurse
couldve been a nurse
she had white shoes
so does grandma
so does shaquille oneal
you told me you had a hysterectomy and he ran off with your nurse
whats the difference
the difference is for twenty years i thought one thing and now its another thing
he was no good
do you remember how he used to scream at me
you used to cover your ears with dinner rolls
also no job was ever good enough for him
small potatoes small potatoes
al you remember al breathes loudly
wait a minute
i thought you didnt know al til after dad left
even the repairman pokes his head out of the refrigerator
oh my god
you and al were and thats why you threw him out
he had a woman in my own bed
and how dare you call him dad in front of al
shakes al by the shoulder this is your father
this is who was there for you when you needed someone
jeanette youre hurting me
on the defensive im not i didnt al you know how i feel about you
al breathes loudly
uncomfortably if i dont call you dad it just because
was already a big boy when you came into our lives pointedly to his mother or when i thought you came into our lives and what did he come back
all of a sudden
because now youre famous and he can get something from you
i dont wan you to become a victim like marcia
to the tv not that youre a victim honey
lifes just been a little hard on you sweetie
to al what do you think
i mean about
should i just
have nothing to do with him
to ed have i ever said a bad word to you about your father
well now i will
he was a crazy mean son of a bitch
al starts to wheel himself out
ed looks weary
but he was your father
theyre monitoring him
they see ed wake up
sleepy and scratching his ass he goes into the bathroom
ed shuts the door
he takes his portable phone out of a bathroom drawer
he stashed it there
he makes a call and waits
its me ed
its been two days i want to see you
no i wont let them follow me i sneak out
no its not allowed but im going for it
im on my way
he takes clothing out of the bathroom hamper
until he finds something acceptable
theyre monitoring the empty bed
ed is dressed
he climbs out his bathroom window
shari opens her front door
she looks down the hallway
theyre not here
he goes in grabs her and kisses her passionately
i tried to tell you over the phone my parents went to atlantic city
so my little brothers staying here
im sleeping with rita
oh je couldnt he sleep with rita
we all have a good time
come on lets go
they get in
they look at each other
do you want to go to a motel
i feel like a criminal or like were cheating on someone
we wont do anything
we just sit here for a while
gently he puts his arm around her
at first she hesitates but then curls up against him and relaxes
i need to talk
are you all right
she lied to me
i mean all my life shes telling me one story and then
it turns out to be a completely different story
come to me at some point tell me the truth
not in my house
the truth is a stranger
and this is why ray and marcia are the way they are
marcia gets involved with all these losers and sees no problem with herself how do they find me she says
ray cheats on you and then blames me for it
im the only one in the family who takes any responsibility for himself
are you all right
i saw that girl come on to you at the tv show
oh that was
she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride
i want you
he touches her
their hands are roaming
theyre breathing hard
hes unbuttoning her blouse
their hands are all over each other
her blouse comes off
lights go on
they see cameras shooting at them
shari screams and covers her breasts
welcome to another day of ed tv
last night while most of us were asleep
four guys in a disgustingly messy room watching the replay of ed and shari
they gyrate lewdly
shari is working
ed is following her around
shari is angry
the cameras are there
get them away from me
she takes packages out of the truck and throws them at the cameramen
its not their fault
its your fault
she throws a package at him
what do you want me to do
you want me to quit the show
if i quit i dont get the balloon payment
ray borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that i dont get if i qu its too complicated
you see how people look at me
like when they ask for my autograph or say hi to me
its like im a basketball player or a
you know like im someone
well yeah everybodys someone
but i mean someone they want to be
i mean lets face it im working in the video store no ones coming in saying oh i wish i was that guy
wish was rewinding that huge pile of tapes
at least for a month im not just a guy with a name tag
a guy yells from across the street
and so are you
guys keep yelling shari
she tries to go after them
ed holds her back
i dont want to be famous for getting caught with my shirt off
if im going to be famous the camera is right in her face
she grabs it
to the camera person this is going right up your ass
he returns the camera
shari starts for her truck
maybe we just better put us on hold until this is over
she gets in her truck
trying to joke see this is why seventy one per cent of the people dont like you
she slams the truck door
it was a joke
vicious thoughtless stupid joke
he bangs himself in the head
she drives away
to the camera and that for you kids out there is how you screw up a relationship
hes worn out
he plops down and puts on the tv
to the camera im gonna watch anything but me
ed is flipping stations
something makes him stop
coming in two weeks to the lifestyle channel joma
his dads a cop his brothers a bouncer in a topless bar his sister is a black belt social worker and jomas living with two gals
we see joma
he has a lot of charisma
he seems a little dangerous but in an exciting way
im coming to get you man
im gonna eat you right up
makes gobbling up noises watching
theyre watching a tape of ed tv
ed has just entered his own apartment
a woman is there sitting on his sofa
shes caressing eds undershorts against her cheek
ed is highly agitated

this other thing this jama that has stink written all over it
the break up with shari was very big
only cynthia seriously
tell ed not to sneak out anymore
he wants it accomplished
its in violation of his contract and if we wanted to be hard nosed about it he could forfeit all pay including money hes already received
dutifully but a tad resentfully i will see that hes properly threatened
whats on the young mans agenda
we dont want to see him sitting around like a lovesick puppy
young males do not want to see ed get back with shari
impatiently enough with her
mcilvaine could ed live with two girls
you know who the audience is requesting a lot
that girl jill that ed met at the letterman show
she really scored
he wants it accomplished
ed is walking from his car to a building
crowds are behind barricades
they yell at ed as he passes
ed is used to this
rita opens the door and sees ed
is shari here
what is she at work
well when will she be back

surprised thats your dog
cynthia doesnt even smile
ed and jill going into a chic club ushered in immediately
here as in the other times we see her jill is comfortable with the situation
shes the opposite of shari
she poses willingly
she chats easily with paparazzi
she clings to ed
theres nothing overt or obnoxious about her
shes just comfortable and good at it and always looks great
interview with the guys who didnt like shari
way to go ed

post story readers pick jill over shari
pictures of both women
jill looks great
shari is in her uniform and looks like a mouse
in a new apartment
watching ed and jill on tv
shes very unhappy
she turns it off
ed and jill at the nice restaurant he was at with shari earlier
it looks like hes starting to like her
ed is refereeing a pro wrestling match
he counts out the villain who then jumps up and chases him out of the ring
ed and jill are in a heavy liplock
carlos is right there with the camera
unlike shari jill seems unself conscious
shes getting ed pretty turned on
shots of viewers also turned on especially the men
you want to
its clear what she means
ed is conflicted
hes clearly aroused
its kind of
he looks for his watch on the wrong wrist then seems to check all around his body until he discovers it
are you busy tomorrow night
why dont you come over
and i make dinner
and you bring a movie
we make a night of it
written on the screen day ed is walking the camera following
he looks tense
people shout hey ed ed die etc
the new york post front page is tonight the night
with a picture of ed and jill kissing
ed looks up
giving the thumbs up go for it
ed continues down the street
people yell to him good luck tonight were rooting for you etc
a street character walks alongside for a minute
this is haitian love juice
he produces a vial you give her this she be yours
security grabs him and the vial falls and breaks
the liquid hits the pavement and smokes up
looking at the smoke jesus
more shouts be gentle we be watching use a condom etc
a school bus passes
the kids yell out the window to ed
in unison good luck
there is no line
at ticket taker sits bored
no one is going in or coming out
the headwaiter stands in the doorway with nothing to do
a party is in progress
the tv is on
on tv ed is in a liquor store buying a bottle of wine
ed is dressed for his date
the people at the party are watching tv and commenting
its like a super bowl party
whats he doing
hes buying wine
several high school age boys
they have made themselves look like ed
theyre very excited
you think hes gonna do it
the guy hasnt had any sex in six weeks
neither have we
eds car turns the corner and he sees a crowd gathered around jills building
understating im starting to feel a little pressure
ed carrying his wine enters to applause and cheers
a long shot encompasses all the houses on the block
their living room tvs are visible
all but one are tuned to ed
something is cooking
jill picks up a plate of something dip and cut vegetables for instance
she starts to exit the kitchen as ed and carlos enter
ed and jill have a soft collision
can i help with anything
its going to be about a half hour
he takes a vegetable dips it and eats it
they look at each other
jill leans forward and kisses him
she puts the tray of vegetables on the counter
they continue to kiss
the high school boys are chanting
ed ed ed ed
college girls same ones as before
oh i hope she makes love to him
i thought you didnt like her
i dont but i want him to be happy rapid shots of other viewers watching transfixed ed and jill are making out
they begin taking each others clothes off
theyre passing the point of no return
its going to happen right there in the kitchen
ed and jill in heavy heat back up to the kitchen table and climb on to it
they continue to pull at their own and each others clothing
theyre making passionate noises
shari is not watching television
shes eating a little meal shes made for herself
she hears people in her building cheering and whooping
she looks miserable
slightly panicky someone say the word how far can we go here
cynthia and her staff are watching
cynthia is on the phone cynthia into phone stay with them
dont leave yet
jill is on top of ed
carried away with passion ed attempts to roll her over and get on top
he does but rolls too far
he crashes off the table to the floor face up
in pain ohhh
do you own a cat
he looks at her apologetically
ed is being loaded into an ambulance
he looks humiliated
people in the street are applauding politely as if ed were an injured ballplayer being carried off the field
jill is by the ambulance
shes petting a cat who looks all right
photographers are taking her picture
shes posing willingly
the ambulance drives off as jill continues to pose
written on the screen day the taping of the tonight show or the late show once again whichever we have a prayer of getting
the monologue is in progress
mock annoyed so i guess you were all watching ed last night
the audience goes wild
this got the highest rating of the year since the super bowl
i guess that makes sense
after all ed is now the buffalo bills of sex
take him off the air
what are you talking about
hes out of the hospital already
the ratings are higher than ever
im telling you its peaked
ed tv is an over inflated balloon
get it off before it explodes all over us
with all due respect cynthia youre nuts
im giving him another month
coldly good luck
ed is walking
hes wearing a white velcro support around his waist
hes carrying a copy of the new york post
look at this
we see a headline ed she broke my heart
she did not
venting you know what she did
she went out to california and got one of those scandal agents
one of those agents who handle like
gennifer flowers and
kato kaelin and joey buttafuco
thats what she hey ed
she was a little too much for you huh
must run in the family
angry oh like this guys ever been with a woman
yells how about i kick your ass til the crack goes the other way
to the camera all of a sudden im like fair game for everyone
im like he stops and looks like hes in shock
he stares in through the display window of a bookstore
a big display of cheap rushed out exploitation books
on the cover we read my brother pissed on me by raymond l
and theres an old photo of two little boys
ed and ray oh my he wrote a book
ray wrote a book
he never read a book
its the hallway of a cheap hotel
ed and the camera come off the elevator
ed looks at room numbers
he can hear the noise from all the rooms
a radio a domestic disturbance a baby crying its a horror
he knocks on a door
who is it
the door opens revealing eds father
come in they enter
theres a liquor bottle on the dresser
ed sees it
howve you been
they dont get cable here so cant watch you
ed just grunts
hank takes laundry off a chair
he looks around
quite a shithole isnt it
it could be if you fixed it up
how did you
i mean how does anyone
wind up like this
i was in jail
the whole time
the last two years ive been a limousine driver but i dont see well anymore so
so you saw me on tv and you said hey let me jump on this
i need help
how many times if just one little thing that i needed wouldve happened it wouldve changed everything
if i had a few dollars when an opportunity came along or
the tumblers just never clicked for me
ed doesnt know what to say
hes bitter towards hank but theres also some empathy
to the camera all right
this is my father i dont know what the hell he can do but if anyone out there can help him get him a job i
mention your business or
i dont know we figure it out
quickly to hank i gotta go
still bitter yeah
sorry is good
you know i finished that model
the pirate ship
hank looks blankly at him
that we were doing together
i finished it
it came out great
because no one was standing over my shoulder bothering me thats too much glue
youre using too much glue
do you still have it
ray sat on it
i see you
out in the hallway he leans back against the door drained
the camera is right on him soaking it up
the same pbs type panel of smart looking people we met earlier
we open on about half the panel
lets hear from our guest panelist
youve expressed some interesting thoughts on this subject
what do you see as the meaning if there is any of ed tv john
reveal john sitting comfortably on the panel looking very wise
i feel that ed is the apotheosis of a prevailing american syndrome
it used to be that someone became famous because they were special
now people are considered special just for being famous
fame itself is now a moral good in this country
its its own virtue
the others nod appreciatively as john puts a pipe in his mouth
i was eds little league coach
he had no coordination
the big game he struck cut with the bases loaded
then he cried like a woman
it was sickening
i was his third grade teacher
i said take him for tests
theres something wrong with him
they didnt listen
he used to steal things from my store
at least i think it was him
yeah it was probably him
a man on the sidewalk has a stuffed cat stuck to his back to tease ed
hey look i just fell off a table
suddenly a tubful of water crashes down on him
ed at the window with a now empty plastic tub
yelling down okay is that funny
then he throws the tub out the window
to the camera how was that
was that funny
again everyone there including cynthia
a honcho is reading a report
of more concern than the sag in eds ratings is what viewers are feeling about him now
the positives are down and the negatives are up
theres a feeling that ed isnt cool anymore
were starting to see a big l
mcilvaine not necessarily
i mean instead of running from the l
run with it
create more moments like the table thing
we can package a video eds goofiest moments
let him be americas goofball
isnt this getting kind of pathetic
i mean we drank the juice now were just licking peel
let it go
cynthia i think youre laboring under a misconception
you seem to believe that because you happened to predict this we should be impressed
anybody in any business can predict failure
need people who prevent failure
i want to see this thing turned back in the right direction
remember this was your baby
tad and barry as we met them originally are watching tv
theyre really enjoying it laughing pounding the table
i dont know i still love this guy
yeah only i wish they had the sister on more
ooh the sister
she is hot
you know it
reveal that they are watching joma
on the tv joma is eating dinner in his apartment with two attractive women who apparently both live there
joma is upset but hes funny when hes upset
whats upsetting him is that across the alley in a window of another building he can plainly see an overweight man with his shirt off exercising
the overweight man is apparently watching an exercise video and is bouncing up and down in place causing everything to jiggle unpleasantly
its like a mudslide
screams out the window put on a shirt
yelling i support the fact that your exercising but for the love of god put on a shirt
to joma shut the curtains
let him shut the curtains
laughing and wiping their eyes
off the air
ed on the phone
this joma is so phoney
i mean those things arent really happening
i think they have writers making that stuff up for him
hey couldnt we do that
hire some writers and have them write up some crazy situations i could get into
shes listening amazed
ed everything goes off
cheers went off
mash went off getting angry yeah but when they went off people werent making fun of them
they werent bozos
im pumpkin ass again
getting annoyed ed you know everything you asked me to do i did
i call you for advice about shari you say mocking imitation leave her be see other people for a while
you just wanted me to get involved with jill because it made for a better show
you screwed up my life just so you could get higher ratings
you never gave a shit about me
well im not starting now
she hangs up and has an acid reflux
ed and john are playing
look you put anybody on tv sixteen hours a day at some point theyre going to wind up rolling off a table on to a cat
i mean with no privacy theres no
you know about that fireman who rescued that little girl
like ten years ago
tries to remember jessica
oh right right
she fell down like a
yeah a thing
he became a big hero
he was on tv and there was a parade and a movie about him right right
and then uh
you know it blew over and he went back to being a fireman again
so he killed himself
a little shaken oh
the cell phone rings
ed picks up the phone
im at the hospital
whats the matter
eddie hes dead
it was his heart
im coming right over
ill be right there
he hangs up
tad is watching tv and talking an the phone
i told you
i told you he was gonna die
ed rushes in
he goes up to the desk
carlos is with him
im looking for my mother
her name is a doctor spots him
your mother is just lying down for a few minutes
we gave her something to calm her down
can i see her
just wait here
shes coming right back out
wearily oh man
sympathetically what about him did he suffer any or was it quick
id hate to think he
between you and me its not a bad way to go
making love to your wife
its very sweet
nods according to your mother
when the paramedics got to the hotel she told them that hotel
what were they doing in a hotel
thank god youre here
eddie looks across the room and sees al in his wheelchair just entering from outside
he wheels towards ed
hows your mother
our neighbors gave me a ride
where is she
is she all right
ed turns to the doctor
i thought i thought he was dead
reads his chart the deceased is
stunned good twist
you thought it was me
its your father
your mother went to see him and he had a heart attack
went again ed turns to the doctor
stack wants to see you
to ed excuse me
to ed could i get your autograph for my niece
how did you the burkharts drove me
are you all right
nervously im fine
i gotta pee
he wheels off
jeanette and ed are left alone
loud whisper what happened
it was horrible
he called me up
he said he wanted to talk to me to apologize for everything he begged he cried
so i went to this horrible hotel he was staying in
i felt so sorry for him so you had sex with him
the doctor said you were having sex
horrified to you
in front of him
indicates carlos with the
he assumed hank was your husband
he didnt know
oh my god
one thing led to another
he was my husband once
but al is your husband now
do you think its been easy for me
its been years
al cant have sex
apparently neither can hank
what the hell did you do to him
al comes rolling back singing
lovely rita the meter maid
whispers dont tell al
he doesnt know
points to the camera well hes the only one in america who doesnt
oprah or ricki or geraldo or someone
women who remarry but have sex with their first husbands
on todays oprah
our same panel of pundits
eds family is the tip of the iceberg
you watch the daytime tabloid shows its the same thing
im telling you america is fast becoming a trailer park
lets not overstate the case
there are millions of hard working sensible moral educated people in this country
not every family is like eds
reveal ed watching this discussion on tv
a chart is set up with little pictures
so lets recap
the mothers too good at it both brothers stink at it
theres a drawing of a figure falling of a table the stepfather cant do it at all and the father did it but it killed him
theres a drawing of a tombstone how did this family ever reproduce in the first place
ed is driving jeanette and al to the funeral
a crowd is held back by police
someone yells adulterer
someone else tries to offer ed a lunchbox
someone else is carrying a sign what a way to go
hanks coffin is being carried to his gravesite
ed ray and marcia are pall bearers
one of the others pall bearers is eds bodyguard
the others two are two guys who work for the mortuary
carlos is shooting
to ray youre not going to talk to me
youre not even gonna say hello
i have nothing to say to you
ed gives up
he turns to marcia
how are you doing
is cliff here
she doesnt answer
cliff left her thanks to you
you put cliff on television
so then he decided he was too good for her and he left
i put his who to marcia look marsh hes not that good a singer hell be back
too loudly thats not funny
the service ends
the small group begins to walk away
ray and marcia go off together ignoring ed
jeanette is attempting to wheel al away from the grave but shes hitting ruts
i take it
to al uncomfortably sweetheart im gonna go ahead and sign all the papers
she touches him but he pulls away
ed wheels al
are things gonna be okay with you and mom
is there anything i can im moving out
im going to be living with my brother
hes not in such good shape as i am but
im looking forward to the pillow fights
really upset oh al
this is just
hank was always good with the ladies
always good looking
hell hes been dead for two days he still looks better than me
he stops wheeling and crouches down next to al
i want to tell you something
i love you
youre my father
i love you too
al kisses him
i build a pirate ship with you
ed wheels him away
shes genuinely moved
she wipes her eyes
this place is sleazy
ed enters worn out
he crosses to the bar where we find jeanette nursing a drink
shes not drunk but she is wallowing
how did you know i was here
somebody called me
what are you doing in a place like this
why shouldnt i be in a place like this
im a whore
im a tramp pulls on the sleeve of the man next to her meet your new father
the whole nation is laughing at us
and how is this helping
come on say good night to all your new friends and lets go home
exiting im a whore
yells at an employee your bathrooms are filthy
ed is helping jeanette
i take her
you humiliated our mother on national television
youve single handedly destroyed this family
i oh but that book you wrote was a real love letter
toilet paper with covers
that book sucked
i want my money back
he looks around
moe is gone
come on ma
to ray lets remember how i got into this
please eddie do this for me
i cant get a break
pretends to cry you know what your problem is
my problem is ive got a brother who writes a sentence like we grew up in a small little bedroom
as opposed to a big little bedroom
i got paid by the word
your problem is you dont ever want anything to be your fault
i take a chance
you wanted to be the guy on tv but you didnt want to say you wanted to
so you have me talk you into it so you get what you want but if it goes bad its not your fault
like you say you love shari but you wouldnt mind noodling that model
the truth hurts
so does a kick in the nuts
for once in your life be honest with yourself
i know you ed
i know you look at me and marcia and mom and you think youre different
youre like how did i end up in this family
youre not different
because you have no guts
you drift around you dont commit you make fun of me okay
just dont kid yourself
to jeanette lets go
youre both good boys
ray and jeanette leave
ed is there along with cynthia and the network execs
there are more execs than before
cynthias people are not there
this entire meeting is on ed tv
cynthia is quiet observing
ed looks whipped
three more months
ed tv is more popular than ever
mcilvaine only ed we want you in the next few weeks to spend a lot more time with your family
cynthia explain it to him
cynthia just stares at her coldly
i do it
to ed people want to see what happens to them now
do your mother and step father get back together
how does your sister handle being alone
your feud with your brother
in fact we have a new concept
since your family signed releases we can follow them on camera even when youre not with them
we can cut around from family member to family member
whoevers the most exciting at that moment
mcilvaine and of course its another big bonus payment for you
a couple of years ago my uncle roy got bit on the ass by a dog
what the hell is he talking about
so he gave me his tickets to the u
open the tennis matches
they still have no idea what hes talking about
so me and ray we tell our friends watch when andre agassi is gonna serve for the first time
when hes bouncing the ball and its real quiet we yell whoop
and you all hear us
he doesnt you know what that is
i mean it was just so we could be heard
so we could stand out from the crowd for a second
so we did it
but we had nothing to say
and the stupid part i mean the really stupid part is we thought it like
elevated us above the crowd
where the fact is it made us stupider than the crowd
stop saying i see
you dont see
cynthia i owe you an apology
i dont think so
because you didnt talk me into anything
everything you wanted me to do i wanted to do
shari watching ed tv
to the camera ray you were right
its like in school
i was always saying the room was too hot the teacher didnt like me but it was me
everything thats wrong with my life i did
so now this is it
my family has problems
which are our fault
and tv is not the place to solve them
so i quit
im taking what very little dignity ive got left and i quit
can someone validate my parking
well ed thats
not really possible
all right i pay for the parking
scharlach speaks carefully gently
hes aware of the camera
he doesnt want to come off as a villain
no i mean you cant quit
very gently well no
you agreed to stay on the air as long as we asked you to
the station entered into this on that understanding
if you had refused wed have begun this with somebody else
you cant just change the rules in the middle of the game son
its not fair to us
more importantly its not fair to the viewers
theyre interested in you
theyve devoted hours and days and weeks of their lives to you
look if you dont let me out of this
i just sit in my apartment all day
i wont go anywhere i wont do anything
what kind of show will that be
not too good
thats why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life youre in violation and are liable for the stations financial losses
ed i urge you to reconsider
i urge you on behalf of all those people out there whose lives have become so entwined with yours
play fair with them ed
let them decide
he turns right to the camera
id like you all to do me a favor
turn me off
just grab the remote and change the channel
i mean basically all youre watching now is a guy deteriorate
the only thing missing is the smell
youre better than that turn me off
greg bursts in carrying a sheet of paper
ratings are up across the board
look at this
drones on men to women to
cynthia stares amazed
ed walking zombie like crowds swarm
ed is with steve a lawyer
steve has a huge contract on his desk
this contract you signed
its a masterpiece
dont go to war with these guys
you fart in the wrong direction they can take everything you own and leave you naked by the side of the road

ed is sitting alone eating lunch
hes surrounded by cameras and shielded by bodyguards
outside the diner a crowd of rubberneckers is out on the sidewalk looking in at him some of them acting up some just staring in
ed is tired
he glances out the window and makes a monkey face
suddenly he freezes
he sees sharis face in the crowd
she puts her fist in her mouth
ed and shari are walking on camera
i bailed on you
its what i do
i yell geronimo and jump out of a relationship
you werent able to make me feel safe or secure no easy job for any man i admit and my problem is if i think im losing i pull myself
out of the game
i told you im the love coroner
what did you do to your hair
my truck overheated so i opened the hood and my hair got caught in the fan belt
so i had to get a haircut
he touches her hair
they leap on each other
theyre big meeting
many honchos including scharlach and cynthia
all but cynthia are focused
cynthia looks bored
honcho l i think this could be great
what if ed and shari decide to get married
the cute little half asian nephew in a tuxedo carrying the ring on one of those big fluffy pillows we kill
a sixty share
a secretary mildred enters
shes a little flustered
scharlach um youre not watching tv
no mildred were working
ed and shari are engaged
theyre in the building
theyre on their way up
scharlach indicates that he wants someone to turn on the tv
someone does and they see ed and shari coming down the hall
they enter the conference room
the cameras of course are with them
ed is carrying a carton
i just came up to pass out these ed tv hats
he takes a lot of hats out of the carton and begins placing on the heads of the honchos
a guy made these up for me
he spelled ed with two ds
the real reason i came up here and then i get out of your way is ive been thinking about what you said
about lets start having more fun with this show you know
lets give it a big kick in the ass
well we were thinking cheerfully shut up
he takes back that honchos hat
lets have a contest
now this would mostly be open to professional investigators and detectives
but anyone can join in
rehearsed what do we have to do
my lovely assistant shari
im glad you asked
the contest is who can dig up legally of course im not suggesting that anyone break any laws the most embarrassing and humiliating facts about any of the executives here
at the north american broadcasting system which owns real tv
the honchos staring blankly
they have to be verified
anything from their past their present business personal arrests affairs
and whoever comes up with the sleaziest most degrading material i give you ten thousand dollars
and you get to be on ed tv
to the honchos excitedly hah
so act now
heres eds home phone number
she holds up a card
its packed with lawyers and execs
everyone is agitated except cynthia who seems relaxed ed and shari are gone
how can this be legal
he is not showing a reckless disregard for the truth
the meeting continues angrily
the honchos are watching ed tv
they look strained anxious
in eds home a bank of phones have been set up like for a telethon
manning the phones are ed shari ray marcia al and jeanette
the phones keep ringing
into phone uh huh
she was how old
in the conference room one of the execs looks dizzy
the camera pans to al on the phone
shocked he pays a prostitute to do what to him
i dont even want that on my shoes
fear and shock except for cynthia who is laughing and cant stop
stop laughing or youre fired
then she gets up

and each contestant gets one of these
holds up a tee shirt with writing on it an i tried to screw a network executive tee shirt
a hundred per cent cotton

ed grabs a sealed envelope
andy plays a drum roll not terribly well
andys available for executions
and the winner is
as he opens the envelope
the executives staring horrified
he takes out the card and registers mock surprise
hey the winner is from right here in new york city
carl bowers a former orderly at the martin center a clinic that specializes in what they call male enhancement procedures
scharlachs eyes widen in horror
to the camera how many of you know what a penile implant is
as it was explained to me what happens is as ed explains scharlach reaches for the phone fumbling it for a moment
and the man of the hour the executive with the winning secret the man who thanks to the miracle of space age science and a pump he keeps in his
pocket can now a shot of a television set tuned to ed
suddenly ed is replaced by a real tv logo
and that concludes real tvs coverage of ed tv
stay tuned for new programming information
an entertainment reporter
a spokesperson for real tv announced that ed received a check covering his four months on the air his balloon payment and an additional bonus to show the networks appreciation
for all his quote hard work and loyalty unquote
when asked the panel

hes the macarena
hes a news reporter is reporting on a wedding
marcia pekurny the woman known to most americans as eds sister was married here today to carlos coto who some of you may remember as the primary camera operator on
ed tv a news show
the current rage of reality television got a real dose of reality today
lifestyle televisions joma was shot this evening outside his apartment
because joma was on television twenty four hours a day lifestyles cameras were there to record the shooting
we see joma walking into his building
somebody steps forward with a gun
the assailant is jostled as he shoots and the bullet hits joma in the ass
he falls to the sidewalk
he shot me in the ass
the camera pans to the assailant who we might recognize as someone who weve seen following ed from time to time
now im famous

i gave him an autograph
shari turns it off
