written by jeff arch from the book by dave barry february nd blazing sun
everybodys living la vida
and were good to go
two men come out of the beacon hotel
loud hawaiian shirts walking a chihuahua
they pause take in the scene on ocean
adjust their earpieces
proceed to first checkpoint and hold
they thread their way to the corner
across the street
onto the promenade
under fat shady palm trees to a clearing agent stearns has a rifle with a kick ass scope
agent leopold watches through binoculars talks through a collar mike
okay sit tight
through binoculars now as two deadly men approach like barracudas
a third guy behind them the kingpin theyre protecting
then as treetops block the view shit
leopold scans looking for them
searching until he finds the hawaiian shirt guys hear that
the see the barracudas getting nearer steal a look at the roof
rinses off at an outdoor shower
beads of spray skip off her like diamonds in the sunlight
she bends twists water streams down every delicious curve
she sure is taking her time
she must be really salty
shakes his head its not just the salt
shes got sunscreen on
then the sand gets on that and it sticks
then still watching hell one time i was in hawaii
and these three models wait a minute
looks at him hawaii
he whips the binoculars back but all thats left is the chihuahua
then walking into the spot hi im dave barry
has something like this ever happened to you
bends down to pet because if youre a guy or if you know someone who is then what youve just seen should look pretty familiar
he picks up the chihuahua starts walking with it
scientists call this condition lust induced brain freeze
it affects millions of guys every day in all walks of life causing anything from a mild embarrassment to an international incident
finds leopold and stearns and several other agents pointing guns at him
hand over the dog
i didnt even know it was a dog
they take it from him rush it away
dave turns to camera
notice i didnt say its a condition that affects men every day only guys
and that subtle but important difference is one of the things this movie is about
a husband and his wife
he has suitcases by the front door
youll never get away with this
ill sue you down to your last penny
good luck i transferred everything we own into private accounts where you cant touch it
in fact as of now youre broke
ive fallen in love with another woman
a younger woman
prettier with no cellulite
actually i think youd like her
the image freezes
dave walks into the room
now clearly this woman is dealing with a man
whereas guys arent capable of doing anything like what you just saw
guys are more like this a different husband sits across from his wife
above and behind her is a tv with sportscenter on
i just want you to know ive thought about this a lot
and ive talked it over with everyone i know
she looks down stirs her soda
so theres nothing left to do now but leave you forever and only see you from across a shiny conference table with bloodthirsty lawyers all around it
a beat turns to her okay
thats all you have to say
then watching him well then i guess this is it
she pushes back from the table starts off
wait a minute
this cant be happening
the words shes waited for
she turns relieved
to the tv how can you dq that
how can you trade lupenza
then to the bartender whats the matter with these people
i saw this on the eight oclock
hes the backbone of the whole team
theyre pikers without lupenza
ill see you in court
i gotta call lenny
he takes out his cell phone
she levels a look
maybe you should call your lawyer too
if he could hit left handed pitching i would
pick up the yankees got lupenza
the image freezes
two old people on a glider
lenore talks directly to camera
alberts absorbed with some device that we cant see
well when i met him i didnt know so much
about guys or men or what have you we just didnt talk about such things then
in fact i didnt see him naked until quite well into our marriage
when was it albert
a year ago
i thought i was marrying a man but didnt know that in his heart he was a guy
when did you first suspect
not long after the wedding
but it didnt bother me
i just didnt know how to recognize the signs
but weve learned to live with it
havent we albert
then after a beat albert
its twelve hundred and thirty one miles from this spot right here to cleveland
what does that have to do with anything
he holds up the device handheld gps
six hundred fifty one from atlanta
who cares how far we are from atlanta
you have a cousin there
theres a person here asking us questions
theres a film crew here
he looks up at the camera as if just noticing someone there
then holding up the gps you
where do you live
here in miami
lenore buries her head
dave walks down a crowded street
colorful day life
like a lot of big cities miami is known for its sizeable population of guys
so we came here to take the citys pulse on the subject
a young pretty single secretary
let me put it this way
everyone i ever dated was a male
i mean they were all men
but only some of them were guys
thinks about it the guys were funnier
but the men were more responsible
you could almost half believe them when they told you something sometimes
so if you were to meet someone that was funny and responsible
that would be a woman
a ish horse groomer talks to the camera while she combs out a mane
well guys theyre sort of like your older brother
and men are like your dad
in what way
your older brother doesnt have to grow up
your dad came that way
dave walks out of the barn towards camera
so now you have some background on basic guy attributes
but before we move on lets look at one more scene and see where you stand elaine works at a window desk
roger watches nfl on fox
now thats the kind of middle linebacker you like to see
hes got the mud all over him hes got the bleeding knuckles hes got the clumps of grass all jammed in his roger
to the tv oh man you gotta show that again shepauses chews her pen
i think i really love you
looks over there but i cant bear the uncertainty anymore of where this relationship is going
im not asking whether you want to get married
only whether you believe that we have some kind of a future together
that you and i have a future
now this is just what you want in a playoff game
you got snow you got mud you got a lead that keeps changing you got two great teams that just hate each other to the bone and would rather die
than give up
then takes the remote and turns off the tv waving elaine over who cuddles into him
ive been thinking too elaine
and for the first time in my life im feeling like i might really be close to a lasting commitment
i havent said anything up until now because its always been important to me that i not mislead you
but yes elaine
i want to think that we dq have a future
and with a little more time i think i could be sure
strokes her hair and pulls her in even closer
they share a long deep sigh together as the picture freezes and dave walks in
if this was how you responded youre not a guy
you may not even exist
then taking the remote on the other hand
im not asking whether you want to get married
only whether you believe that we have some kind of a future together
that you and i have a future
then looking at him roger
engrossed in game what
freeze on her look and if that was you
youre a guy
sheryl crow talks to the camera before going onstage
the muffled sounds of the warmup band o
well there were always guys at my shows right from the beginning
i mean you start out playing beer halls right
so when you have beer you have guys
and it sorta just grew from there
but i was okay with it
they didnt cause much trouble
and what about men
men cause trouble
but thats okay too
i get half my songs from that
so it all works out
long as they buy the records
dave walks along the stacks in the anthropology section
so where did this all start
many experts now think they know where men came from but what about guys
where did they come from
he stops peels off a thick book full of science things
to answer this question accurately we might have to look something up
so instead well travel back to prehistoric sub saharan africa and get there just in time for the dawn of guys
the endless expanse
a cluster of caves
sound efx of all kinds of nasty shit out there
skittering over rocks
slithering through the grasses
bigger predators circling
a rooster cocks his head back and crows out
primate roger opens one eye
sees primate elaine primate kids and primate in laws
hairy grunting things all sleeping in a protective clump
he rolls over back to sleep
but the rooster crows again
primate roger comes out
a sleepy nod at primate gene and other primates as they take up large jagged rock slabs leaning against their caves and start off
in a few million years theyll be leaving suburban driveways this way
primate roger and primate gene have joined primate lenny and primate phil
all carrying their slabs of jagged rocks
grunt grunt grunt grunt grunt
and thats why wildebeests are so mean
grunt grunt grunt
thats really funny
i dont get it
the other three look at him
primate women work in stooped over positions trying to pound roots and tend fires while baby primates crawl all over them
they hear the primate guys laughter trailing off
they trade looks something seems to pass between them
primates roger gene lenny and phil get to the grounds and see primates pete and louie already there
these two dont have the rock slabs though
grunt grunt grunt
weve been hunting
where are your jagged rock slabs
looks at primate grunt grunt grunt
a who needs slabs
primate pete laughs with him then holds up a round rock about the size of a grapefruit
primate roger and primate gene trade looks with primate lenny and primate phil
grunting subtitles continue
whered you get that
primate discount manny
he just got them in
mind if i have a look
be my guest
he hands it over
primate roger lays down his jagged rock slab to check it out
his buddies gather round
how do you kill an animal with that
you throw it
you mean you dont chase the old ones until they get tired and then hit them with the jagged rock slabs
shakes his head you can stand in one place all day
and when they go by you just let loose
he shows a throwing motion
the first four look intrigued
you can carry more than one and if youre throwing uphill it rolls back down if you miss
its so much easier with these
im sticking with mine
then off their looks weve been using these jagged slabs forever
and you know why
because they work
and anyway killing them is only half of it how are you gonna skin a wildebeest with that
they look at primate pete yeah how
but hes there
we get the women to do it
they look among themselves
they like it
im working on it
the primate women are still pounding roots and tending fires and dealing with climbing primate kids
they hear shouts o
gather and go to the ridge where they see the primate guys are coming back without their jagged slabs and without any animals
but they are having great fun
running in primitive patterns and throwing one of the rocks back and forth and chasing whoever has it
it looks like the beginnings of rugby or australian rules football in terms of all they need now is beer
the primate women watch
and trade looks
once more something seems to pass between them
primate roger and primate elaine try to keep it down for the primate kids sake
grunting subtitled please dont tell me you got rid of your jagged rock slab
but these are great
but you didnt kill anything
nobodys going with jagged slabs anymore
but the kids are hungry
what about your pounded roots
pounded roots are a side dish
they need balance in their diets
then off his look and another thing suppose you do start bringing animals home using this whos going to skin and clean them
he looks at her the sound of tomorrows rooster crowing as primate roger comes out of the cave with his rock
he gives it such a look
then looking up at the sky he hurls it up as high as he can
which roger is holding across from elaine on the couch
five hundred dollars
it can hold a thousand addresses
so can my address book
can your address book pick up your em ail
no but my computer can
well this can do both
for five hundred dollars it should give me a manicure roger
it should drive me home from work at night
how could you spend that kind of money without discussing it first
on rogers look
the picture freezes
dave walks in
theres a whole list of things a guy is supposed to discuss first
unfortunately he never knows what they are until hes already not discussed them
to a girl its a pain in the butt
but to a guy some things just come naturally
shrouded in fog
explorer roger scans the horizon through a spyglass
next to him is long suffering explorer elaine
well did you ask
this is a shortcut
explorer elaine shakes her head
theres a very simple reason why guys dont ask for directions
its because they know that if they do someone else most likely visigoths will come and steal their woman
camera pans to the side rails where a cluster of hungry visigoths nod slobbering confirming this
i just want to get to colonial america
a bunch of guys dressed as indians are throwing barrels into the water
a colonial reporter interviews colonial roger
and this is your way of expressing the public outrage over the high handed anti democratic actions of the british government in general and king george iii in specific
looks a little nervous uh yeah
might i ask sir whose idea was this
guy over there
the one drinking coffee
his names starbuck
he said to get rid of all the tea
one more question
arent those greek fraternity letters painted on your chest
the guy looks greek letters in greasepaint
i didnt do that
then as the reporter dont tell anyone
four miami girls ethnically cross sectioned
well thats pretty much how it is right now right
they dont grow up
or they grow up but they dont change
you want to know how to spot a guy theres your first clue look for an otherwise man who did not grow up
no they grow up all right but only just enough you know
like theyll meet the absolute minimum requirements of being a man but thats it
the rest of the time theyre fourth graders
walking fourth graders
more like driving fourth graders
with credit cards
and a phone
and give them ten minutes on their own
or put them in with other guys
now youve gone nuclear
the lot is filled with s and s cars
dave gets out of a chevy vega has mutton chop sideburns talks to camera
in learning to understand guys today its important to remember that these same guys only yesterday were just kids
a table of year old boys punching eating climbing all over each other
one poor luckless dad with them
were not punching
you are too punching now stop
we didnt come here to punch
they stop look at him as if hes crazy
then one of them notices roger at looking o
hey rogers got a girlfriend
i do not
then whatre you looking at
and they start punching again
the dad looks up so weary
here we can see where even at an early age guy behavior is already well developed along complex patterns that social scientists have called jerks
while girls at the same age are referred to by the same social scientists as human beings
they are all chatting nicely passing out napkins and ketchup packets making sure everyone has what they need
while the mother that brought them quietly reads a novel
he walks past with his takeout order
as elaine at notices roger blushing taking all this punishment because of her
as dave exits will you please stop punching
dave sits across from a british guy with a subtitle saying noted pediatrician
he has a laser pointer and a powerpoint presentation
where are we in the area of guy violence doctor
well first one must understand the inherent differences in dna and cell structure as relates to men and women
for example all women have a gene that makes them have the need for meaningful conversations
likewise all men have a gene in them that we scientists believe is directly related to violence
and what can be done about that
well some of my esteemed colleagues are quite keen on the idea of tampering with the dna itself an idea with which i heartily disagree
then what would you recommend
well they can start by spreading out the funding a little bit
let a few other scientists wet their beaks
i mean whats the point of rewarding the same tired old hacks year after i meant about guy violence
then shifting back well nothing really
i mean what can you do
short of lobotomizing them anyway
no i suppose well just have to continue to channel their aggression into socially acceptable outlets
like professional wrestling or the space program
can i ask you a question
whered you get that laser pointer
dave stands in front of the entrance
a lot of work has been done in the field of childrens toys and how they unconsciously reinforce gender roles
studies have found that over ninety three per cent of this work is done by researchers who dont have children of their own
but to test the theory anyway were here at toy world warehouse planet
dave shepherds new father gene up to the customer help counter
my friend here is looking for toys for his son that are gender neutral environmentally sound and culturally unbiased
here it is
he brings up a box with a picture of a spinning top on it
whats it do
where are the trucks and guns
new father gene meets up with new mother kelly at the car
she came from grocery world he helps load up the bags
looks sees the toy oh i got that for benjy
you were supposed to get a rattle
all the rattles were recalled
so you bought a tank
waitll you see what this can do baby
benjys gonna love it
can he shake it
will it rattle
this thingll bring down a bookshelf
she looks at him
hell be returning the thing within seconds
camera pans to dave who shrugs
a rundown place with junked cars out front
eds an intense little guy in a tigers hat and a couple major tattoos
well im into fireworks
i like to take em apart you know
and study em
see what makes em tick
he shows dave a box with assorted fireworks inside
i just got these from ohio
i dont think theyre as good as the ones i got from tennessee
not as loud you know
well no if loud is your if you want to hear loud listen to this
he goes over to a different box takes out what looks like a stick of dynamite
gets ready to light it turns to camera
you may want to step back a couple hundred yards
as eds auto shop recedes in the background with a loud explosion accompanying so when we see guys like ed and his fireworks or guys shooting marine flares into innocent
pumpkins or building catapults thatll throw a buick we should not condemn them
we should not assume these are just pointless juvenile activities
instead we should be convinced they are and move on to guys in the workplace
a philadelphia girl stands outside a cheesesteak place
guys at work
or guys doing work
i mean unless you want to talk about faxing or emailing their stupid jokes back and forth
dave and a seasoned broker eat hot dogs from a corner cart
ten fifteen years ago
a guy would call you up with some joke he just heard
so you wanna pass it on its by phone
one person at a time
then a while later some guy calls you up with the same exact joke
then when group faxing came in it really sped things up
next thing you know theres like ten faxes on your machine from places you never even heard of
places around the world im saying
and how long would that take
a run of the mill guy walks into a bar joke thosed take about
week to come back to you
the topical ones your mass murders and tragic accidents and the like theyre naturally gonna have a lot more heat on them and theyll circulate a lot quicker
i mean no ones gonna sit on a princess diana joke until three weeks after the crash
no one i know anyway
now theres the internet and what used to take a weekll take like seconds
im telling you its getting harder and harder to keep up
a lot of people dont understand the attention and the kind of importance these jokes have
oh you mean women
well you know whats the importance of having fifteen pairs of shoes
no one knows that
roger is slumped across the back seat messed up clothes and in obvious pain
elaine drives talks to camera
so i get this call at work
then to roger back you want to tell this
its just a sprain
shakes her head i get on the phone and they say hes okay but maybe i should come down to the paper and get him
does he look okay
its a sprain
it just looks worse
not the way i heard it
rogers at his desk cant help but hear patrick tom and gene talking nearby
hes how old
i could run the forty that fast
you and who the flash
this kid set a national record
tell me something
if the article was about a poem there wouldnt be an argument would there
why would there be an article about a poem
im just saying
i dont see the four of you fighting over who can write the better sonnet
so no one gets hurt writing sonnets
off her look then its a sprain
roger listens more agitated as the argument mounts
when did you last run the forty
i could beat you in the forty running backwards
you couldnt even beat your butt running backwards
from his desk will you guys cut it out
look at him
the kid in the storys in high school
youre supposed to be adults and youre bragging about who can beat who in a stupid footrace
no ones bragging
genes just saying he can run the forty in under six seconds
i can do it in under six seconds
freeze the picture on their expressions
bring up chariots the four guys crouch in their starting stance
a secretary stands at the end of a marked off course with a stopwatch and a whistle
she blows the whistle
all four guys explode off the line
patrick gets five strides and goes down
tom gets two more and falls howling in pain
then gene and roger neck and neck for at least three more strides until roger hears a pop that echoes over the music and goes toppling down
as gene finishes alone gripping his side in awful pain but pumping his fist in victory
elaine comes in roger limping and leaning heavily on her
i dont know why i listened to you
you need to see a doctor
its a sprain elaine
roger you cant walk
itll work itself out
she gives him a look
parks him long enough to close the door behind him
without her support he drops to the floor
she turns to the camera
why wont they go to the doctor
british white coat stethoscope
he holds up a rubber glove
dangles it harmlessly
i dont care who they are
if they think theres even a chance their doctor will use one of these and they always assume there is they wont come in
puts it away shakes if theres anything out there that would bring them in
it hasnt been invented yet
it says so on the sign
another sign like an international road sign has a graphic of a hand in a rubber glove with a red line through it
there are also sports team banners
the doctor checks a guys chart
theres a tv with espn on in the exam room
what seems to be the problem
well the main thing is i keep coughing up blood
and i get these really severe chest pains and double vision sometimes
and every night at sunset little worms come burrowing out of my skin
its just a sprain
thats what i thought
karla e mia lila and sidra again with dave
a lot has been said about how guys dont share their feelings
you mean they have them
or they have them and dont acknowledge them
or they dont think that others have them
or they just dont think
as they agree on is it possible that they do have feelings they do acknowledge them and they do know others have them but they just dont express it the
four blank faces look at him
they have feelings about sports
and their underwear
you ever try and throw out their underwear
i nearly lost my life
they act like its so sacred
ive seen pairs of briefs with holes in them larger than the leg holes
as the others nod i tried to throw a pair out once
and sneak it past him
he went out into the garbage and found them
he said he couldnt trust me after that
tell me what thats all about
i dont even want to think about it
off their reactions so you agree then that guys at least have feelings
they just waste them
roger and elaine get out of rogers car
elaine has an armload of magazines
genes dad is real sick
kelly says he doesnt talk about it
so see if you can draw him out
he already did talk about it
what did he say
he said his dad is real sick
she gives him a look
gets to the door
what are those
kellys boss is turning forty
so youre giving her magazines
a look then just see if you can get him to talk
theres a game on
gene sort of stares
roger has a shoebox on his lap goes through genes sega cartridges
while roger keeps can you believe the yankees got lupenza
they get everybody
roger pulls out two cartridges compares them
i got to level of arkanoids
gene shakes his head
this is big
youve seen the evil presence
then off his look whats it look like
gene shrugs even the best of friends
camera pans to dave
believe it or not ladies that was sharing
then nods to kitchen and believe it or not guys so is elaine and kelly with magazines and writing pads
well i dont know
how do you think she feels about getting older
i dont know
i know how i felt
how did you feel about it
how does anybody feel
so you think shell want a smaller gathering
well if we go that way we know who to invite
but then who do we not invite
and how are they going to feel about that
so maybe we should make it a slightly larger gathering
depends on the food i guess
i mean if we go with a larger gathering
finds the right i saw something earlier in here about low fat hors doeuvres
oh ive seen that one too
they open to the article scanning it
you thinking what im thinking
that if we have low fat hors doeuvres shell think we noticed shes gaining weight
maybe just blow it out you know
i mean its a party
go with the high fat
thinking she wont think weve noticed the weight gain
unless she thinks thats insensitive
you know that we hadnt noticed
they close the magazine look through the others when how about medium fat hors doeuvres
and we could cut them into smaller pieces
she could think we were being cheap
and how would she feel about that
roger and gene watch a porsche commercial without the sound
that one has the gps
with the screen that has maps of everything
what about with the convertible
its optional on the convertible
unless you get the turbo then its standard
phil wonkerman got the turbo
phil got a porsche
said it was his birthday present to himself
when was his birthday
probably around the same time when he got the car
maybe we should get him something
looks at him he just got a porsche
they look at the tv again
then from the kitchen doorway roger
elaine gives roger a look
picture freezes as
roger met elaine at a company event
people with nametags mingle with drinks and appetizers
dave comes away from the hot buffet table with a great haul
they discovered they had something in common right away
he points to roger and elaine over by a tiki torch
that was you
at the burger king
i was in fourth grade
i was too
but my god you remembered that
off rogers nod she loved that he remembered that
a glow bowl night neon and black light and music
handing out shoes a few nights later he asked her out
he points over to the lane where theyre bowling
they had a good time and so he asked her again
and then before too long they were seeing each other regularly and not seeing anyone else
of course elaine was the only one who knew that
roger opens elaines door for her then goes around
she lingers watches him before she gets in
she smiles gets in
camera pans to dave
roger has no idea that this was a defining moment for her
roger gets in
fuzzy but not sure why
elaine looks out ahead
long stretch of road and no one on it
she turns looks at him
do you realize that as of tonight weve been seeing each other for exactly six months
camera holds on her
i wonder if it bothers him that i said that
maybe he thinks im trying to push him into some kind of obligation that he doesnt want or isnt sure of
maybe hes been feeling confined enough by our relationship as it is
then thinking about well hey you know
im not so sure i want this kind of a relationship either
sometimes i wish i had a little more space so id have time to think about whether i really want us to keep going this way
i mean where are we going
are we just going to keep seeing each other at this level of intimacy
are we heading toward marriage
toward a lifetime together
am i ready for that level of commitment
do i really even know this person
so that means it was
february when we started going out which was right after i had the car at the dealers which means
lemme check the odometer
he looks down at it whoa
i am way overdue for an oil change here
camera pans to elaine
an oval image of her appears in the top corner of the screen they watch him together
i can see it on his face
you know maybe youre reading this completely wrong and he wants more from the relationship
and maybe whats happening is hes sensing my reservations
well dont bet the farm on it
but and thats why hes so reluctant to say anything about his own feelings hes afraid of being rejected
and im gonna have them look at the transmission again
i dont care what those morons say its still not shifting right
and they better not try to blame it on the cold weather this time
what cold weather
its eighty seven degrees out and this thing is shifting like a goddam garbage truck and i paid those incompetent lowlife bastards six hundred dollars
and i dont blame him
id be angry too
god i feel so guilty putting him through this but i cant help the way i feel
im just not sure
you know what your problem is
youre too idealistic
youre waiting for some knight to come riding up on his white horse when youre sitting next to a perfectly good person a person you enjoy being with a person
you truly do care about a person who seems to truly care about you
a person who is in pain because of this self centered schoolgirl fantasy that you insist on clinging to
camera pans to roger
his oval image appears at the local bar with a beer in front of him and pool tables in b
theyll probably say its only a ninety day warranty
thats exactly what theyre gonna say the scumballs
let em say what they want
you dont have to listen
you know youre right
they want a warranty
ill give them a goddam warranty
ill take their lousy warranty and stick it right up their roger
please dont torture yourself like this
maybe i should never have
oh god i feel so
looks over alarmed she struggles to keep control
her oval image disapproves
im such a fool
i mean i know theres no knight
i really know that
theres no knight and theres no horse
theres no horse
he looks up his oval image shrugs gets up off the stool
you think im a fool dont you
reacting to the oval no
he looks over at her not sure who he responded to
but it appears he said the right thing anyway
well i need
time i think
i think i need some time
roger looks up at his oval image gone
he looks at elaine
moved touches his oh roger do you really feel that way
do you feel that way about time
roger looks confused
his oval image is off playing pool now
he turns to elaine does his best to look decisive
yes i do feel that way
thank you roger
he looks a little nervous
she looks serene
roger drives away
elaine goes into her building
already dialing her cell phone
come on kelly pick up
while roger and his oval image watch an obscure foreign soccer game
share a giganto bag of doritos
hey ref look alive
those guys were offsides
who the albanians or the moroccans
they both suck
he eats some more doritos
but then suddenly he pauses
i think i missed something back there
wait for the replay
shakes his head no i mean in the car
cant help you
i was shooting pool
roger looks up at his oval image
elaine huddles with kelly
and you said theres no knight
and no horse
did you say no knight and no horse or no horse and no knight
she looks at elaine
this is crucial
i said no knight
and then i said no horse
i know he agreed to the knight
but maybe not the horse
elaine racks her brain just cant say for sure
its probably not important
then watching her this is really it for you
looks at her nods really it
glad for her does he know it
elaine looks up she has no idea
roger and gene get ready for some on
roger passes to gene
who passes it right back
roger takes the ball dribbles almost starts but doesnt
gene looks at him
a beat then elaine and i
elaine and you what
a beat then he shrugs we sort of have this thing
he looks at gene
conveys the full impact of this
then did she ever mention owning a horse
she ever talk about horses
like to kelly or something
not that i know of
then shakes it off
throws the ball to gene
whats the score
we havent started yet
they start to play
camera finds dave on a nearby bench
rogers in love
sheryl crow takes a break in the mixing booth
i can sympathize with your friend man
ive seen a lot of guys go there
do you have any advice for a guy in love
i dont know most of my songs are about guys out of love
cause you know a guy in love a guy whos where your friends at anyway they dont know where they are
theyre like an ant standing on a truck tire
they dont know how they got there all they know is thats not where they were a minute ago
but then they sort of get vaguely okay with it you know
they start hangin out there theyre feelin pretty good
until the thing starts moving
what happens then
well then they get crushed
rock and roll my friend
life in the city
the day john kennedy beat nixon and won the white house
that was the day i met her
his wife turns looks at him funny
it was close the whole way it was neck and neck by god
but then old kennedy senior rode on in on that big old pile of money of his and fixed the results in illinois
and that made all the difference
happiest day of my life just about
she watches him
the man is hopeless
i was walking away from a newspaper stand with my head buried in the final edition
and i looked up and there she was
he looks over at his you were wearing a yellow sun dress and there was a smudge of makeup just over your left eye
he smiles at her
gets a thin smile back
that wasnt me
of course it was you
what are you talking about
it was your first wife
we met in sacramento
eight and a half years ago
dont believe her
ive never owned a yellow sun dress in my life
and even if i did i wouldnt be wearing it in november
off her look the point is in an irish catholic could be elected president of this fine country as long as his father was a filthy rich rum runner with
connections to the mafia
and when nixon did get elected he had to quit
his wife shakes her head
kelly and gene on the sofa
well we didnt know each other
i mean of course we didnt we hadnt met yet
but we were both invited to the same party by different people who we only knew marginally only the party got cancelled and i guess thats how marginal we were
because no one told us
so we came in different cars and found ourselves at the same front door with no one home
then taking his hand so gene asked me out to eat
i was hungry
you were in love
then off his look you told me you loved me that first night
i said i loved mashed potatoes
you were eating mashed potatoes
you said you loved me
you said because your name was gene and mine was kelly that that just proved it
we were meant to be together
off her look then does this have to go in the movie
dave walks out talks to the camera
contrary to what many women believe its fairly easy to develop a long term stable intimate and mutually fulfilling relationship with a guy
as long as this is the guy with human guys its extremely difficult
this is because guys dont really grasp what women mean by the term relationship
a jersey girl on break at a snack hut
what i dont get is how they can be a fully grown adult male and not be able to make a commitment to a woman who loves him like no
one else and yet the same person at age seven could make an unbreakable lifelong commitment to the san francisco giants who do not even know him and who never will
shakes her head i just dont get it
a seattle girl outside the cafe
theyre never ready
if you ask me guys are in a permanent state of nonreadiness
thats where they live
if guys were turkey breasts you could put one in a degree oven on the fourth of july and they still wouldnt be ready in time for thanksgiving
the owner arranges titles on a display outside her store
the thing is you shouldnt even think about marrying them until you really know them
but you cant really know them until you marry them
then after a beat thats the thing
a manhattan girl gives a world weary look
one a guy will have sex with anything
two a guy will do anything to have sex
theres your guy fidelity
elaine and roger are inside looking at the front door
what do you mean its supposed to be that way
its basic physics elaine
and then later it contracts
but we cant get out
which also means other people cant get in
thats part of the design it discourages burglars
looks at him the same way the toaster was designed to discourage carbohydrate consumption by bursting into flames
that was an outdoor toaster
it was clearly not designed for indoor situations
the picture freezes
dave steps in front talks to camera
i think its obvious here that roger has absolutely no idea what hes talking about
but guy pride forces him to keep acting like he does know for reasons i believe weve covered in an earlier scene
he nods his head over to the corner where the camera pans to see huddled visigoths waiting
then back to roger and elaine as the picture unfreezes
so now we have a broken water heater and a stuck front door
i think its time to call steve
elaines image freezes
roger turns to the camera
steve leaves someones house heads for his super outfitted truck
haloed in golden sunlight
strong capable equipped for every situation
women look out from kitchen and bedroom and living room windows from front steps and yards and gardens just to see whose house steve is leaving
the women look all dreamy the way they would in a really corny musical
watching to camera as far as women are concerned god didnt really rest on the seventh day
on the seventh day god created steve
as the women all sigh
elaine stands at the basement door
clanging down there
did you find anything
hes in ankle deep water
pokes a flashlight into some of the corners where the overhead bulb doesnt reach
good news honey
the basements level
how can you tell
because i know a well built floor when i see one
we were right to buy this house
everything works just the way it should
except theres no hot water
aiming the flashlight sweetheart dont you remember
the power company talked about this
how about calling steve
well call steve when we have a real problem
then more to himself a mouse gets the hiccups you dont have to call steve every time
hears him whang something down there but roger youre such a good copy editor
you dont have to be a good repairman too
okay i think i found it
the water heater
elaine leans her head against the door jam
elaine sits on the step looking blank
kelly is with her
there are loud noises from the basement
i dont know why he does this
he doesnt know what hes doing down there
itll be all right
off a loud clang its not like some broken part is just going to be standing there waving a flag that says help me
or therell be an octopus on the compressor and then he could say look
theres an octopus on the compressor
of course how would he know it was the compressor
trust me itll all work out
after a while theres no more harm they can do
roger comes around from the side door
holds a dripping part
i just need to go to the hardware store
kelly smiles waves
then as roger sloshes past to the car
and what is it about the hardware store
all they do in there is buy a bunch of tools that they dont know how to use and no matter what the problem is all theyll end up doing
is whacking at it with a hammer until it breaks even more
and then they cover it all up with duct tape and then come out and say its supposed to work that way
then we have to call steve
and they get offended
roger waits at the counter
talks to camera
let me tell you something
if i had a dollar for every time i heard steves name i could hire somebody better than steve just to shake things up
get her one of these old semi retired guys someone from the pre steroid days with the hairy shoulders and the butt crack
they wont be so quick to call him every ten minutes
the clerk comes back
hands over a piece tool set
keep these away from anything magnetic
he takes the tool kit from the clerk and drops it
the clerk watches roger chase down all the parts what a dolt
roger puts the tool set in his trunk
the thing is i missed out
turns to camera its like everyone else was there the day they taught all this stuff
how to look inside acar
or a furnace
or a rocketship
but the guys like steve youknow
they were born knowing allthis and now theyre laughing
they all go down to the competent guys tavern and compare notes
vans and pickup trucks just like steves are parked outside
a steve lookalike gets out and goes in greeting another steve also arriving
laughter pours out from inside
steve rings the bell
elaine tries opening the door
on other side im sorry the doors stuck
i can fix that
he checks it out taps it in one place and opens the door
elaine steps aside enchanted as roger drives up and sees this
and the pain in his heart is something we can feel
powers back on
steve pulls the cover off the hvac assembly
roger is sorting through the piece tool set he bought and has no idea what to do with
if youve got a minute sir
id like to show you something
holds up tool kit should i bring these
that wont be then as all the parts necessary
the latch broke
i can fix that
roger puts the tool kit down
theres your problem right there
you got calcification in your pullet beam header grommets
i was afraid of that
steve looks at him
one of those sideways looks
what you gotta do is jack up your laminate bolts and remove the calcification on the stress points
while steve takes of course when he says you he doesnt mean me
i dont have jacks
i dont have winches
and steve has got like fifty kinds of each right on his truck
if society collapsed the steves of the world will be living in nice sturdy shelters that they built with their own hands eating food that they grew or caught
and ill be getting shredded to death by wolverines
here we go
he reaches down
pulls out a fuse assembly holds it up
here we go
back in business in no time
steve is packing up his truck
roger is about to go back dad look
look what steve made me
a working battleship made entirely out of coke cans
it is a working battleship made from coke cans
this is so neat
the kid runs off
roger looks at elaine
do we have a kid
steve got him from the truck
dave rides up front with steve
talks to camera
just because steve can fix things doesnt mean hes shallow and doesnt have any concerns
all guys have concerns
you like sportstalk
mike the moose
steve gives him a look
turns on the radio
im just sayin those owners better never run into me
because god help em man
and well pick up on that and more right after the news
i mean it man
mike the moose flips a switch turns to dave
three months ago the marlins traded a guy named rufino lupenza to the yankees for some minor league players and cash
i grant you it was a rotten trade
i grant you the yankees seem to have this this knack for making brilliant deals year after year
but three months
pops in a tape the marlins are over it
the yankees are over it
the players and their families are over it but just check this out
the guy was a workhorse
he filled in wherever he was needed and he never got hurt
and when he got hurt he played hurt
you know i got a post card from him here at the station
he says theyre all doing fine lucitas got the kids in their new school already and they all seem happy
she even found an ecuadorean grocery she likes
grocery the guy batted from both sides
his on base percentage was in the s with a rocket arm on defense and an awareness of the field like nobodys business
and they trade him for minor leaguers
for untested greenhorn punks who can barely even pauses the tape that guys pretty normal
he cues forward plays
a guy caller fighting tears
you just have to move on stan
i try to im trying
but i just cant make sense of this
mike the moose stops the tape
these are guys you wouldnt see crying even at a funeral
guys who cant bring themselves to hug their own children
and theyre beside themselves
shakes his head and all over a meaningless trade
mike the moose looks at him
roger and gene are watching the knicks heat game
big bag of doritos between them
seventy seven per cent from the line during the regular season and a red hot eighty three per cent during the playoffs
stop saying that
and in the fourth quarter of the playoffs that number is even higher stop saying that
so they really picked the wrong guy to foul at this crucial point in such a crucial game
stop saying that
he sets he dribbles again
roger and gene lean forward
come on come on come on comeoncomeon miss the shot miss the shot miss the shot come on and miss the shot and the knicks call time out
they lean back in their seats breathe some relief
elaine and kelly are addressing invitations by hand
dave sits on the counter listens in
they dont know the players
the players dont know them yet they idolize these people
they follow them from team to team and they know more about these teams than they know about their own families
they might not even know if they have families
not during the playoffs anyway
amen to that then and what gets me is they think they really think that whether a team wins or loses or not depends on how much they personally care
like if they dont care the team cant win
but thats true
they look over see him on the counter
its true that the level of concern a guy shows for his team can affect the outcome of the game
then off their looks i mean not just one guy but lots of guys
all the guys who care about the team combined if they really care can make a difference on the scoreboard
who is he
hops off the counter follow me
roger and gene and the game are frozen in place
dave stands in the doorway with elaine and kelly
for the first time ever through the use of highly advanced technology we will be able to see the actual concern rays emanating from the minds of roger and gene
in their attempt to affect the outcome of this upcoming and totally critical foul shot
the picture changes as though a filter has been slipped over the lens
then we begin to see the actual rays emanating from rogers and genes foreheads and traveling into the screen
the rays are colored blue
these concern rays go straight into the television screen where they join the combined concern rays of all the other guy fans watching this game right now
where all the cities representing major markets light up and form arcs like airline flight routes connecting red or blue concern rays from each city and sending them to miami
in front of map then the rays are transmitted to the actual arena itself all arriving at the same moment regardless of any geographic or time zone differences
dave reports as blue and red concern rays materialize from the sky and descend on the arena covering the roof
and it is here at the arena where the combined concern rays from both teams fans will be measured not just for quantity but for quality
because this as every guy must believe is what wins ball games
dave steps away and the picture un freezes
he takes the shot
its come on come on come on
miss the shot miss the shot miss the and he misses
it bounces off the rim and miami wins the game
what a comeback
a field day for the heat
roger and gene leap up and scream
high fives victory dance
dave looks at elaine and kelly who look at each other
lets get back to those invitations
im with you
they turn go back to the kitchen
the celebration goes on
dave walks down a terminal corridor among hurrying passengers
if theres one thing women dont know about when it comes to guys its the public rest room problem
and were here to clear that up right now
he stops outside a mens rest room which is currently closed for maintenance
this room is a private hell for a countless number of guys yet the women in their lives are completely in the dark about it
but before we go inside lets talk with a leading social scientist so that what were about to show you sounds a little more official
dave is at the honor bar with the same british guy
the words leading social scientist appear under him this time
one has to understand that the act of emptying ones bladder goes deep to the very roots of masculinity
it is an important territorial statement that males are genetically programmed to carry out
in fact many of my colleagues believe the reason that dogs howl at the moon is because they cant go up there and urinate on it which is not however
a theory which i embrace
but guess who gets all the grant money every year
he stares off into space
a bitter man
you were saying
i didnt want this job
twenty years in the social sciences
and what was everybody else doing they were getting laid
they were going to bed with women
and what have i been doing applying for matching grants
and not getting them
applying for any grants at all and not getting those either
meanwhile all the cool dudes are laughing
honda accords fill the lot
two more drive up and a scientist gets out of each
they hail each other and go in together
as they pull open the door laughter spills out from inside
there is a satellite dish on top
dave is with john madden
with me now is the great john madden legendary coach of footballs oakland raiders and veteran network analyst for cbs sports and now the fox sports network
john thanks for coming by today
happy to be here dave
john you heard what our leading expert said about this particular anxiety that guys have regarding bathrooms in general and public ones in particular
well hes exactly right dave
i mean the guy was a little loopy but he hit the nail on the head
so an airport bathroom presents a specific kind of challenge
the worst kind dave and in a lotta ways
because a guys main goal is to get in and outta there without having to deal in any other way with any other guy and in an airport bathroom especially
with the turnover rate theyve got hes up against some pretty mean odds
couldnt agree more john
lets go technicians wearing headsets
dave and john sit by a bank of monitors
theres a telestrator for john
now this angle here were outside the bathroom and the maintenance guys just about to open it up
we see the area outside the mens room with closed for maintenance signs in english and spanish
a janitor starts removing the signs as a business traveler heads over
heres our first candidate now john diagrams the action marking up the screen like a football play while the action unfolds
okay now the leadoff guy hes gonna come in hes gonna see the open field and hes gonna swing wide right to grab a spot against the wall
hes got one flank covered this way and for now hes feelin pretty good and of course by doin that hes also settin the tone for everything that happens after
whats the main thing were looking for john
what does each individual guy feel he needs to get out of this
well the crucial thing here is makin sure theres no eye contact
i mean none zero
these guysll look up theyll look down theyll look straight ahead but a guy would rather have you poke both his eyes out with burning hot fire tongs dave than
to give the next guy over a reason to think you might be lookin at him in a public bathroom
for reasons that oughtta be pretty darn obvious
now here comes guy number two the second guy comes in john diagrams the call
now guy number two what hes gonna do is hes gonna come in see the first guy in position along the wall and right away hes gonna line up wide
on the opposite side
this is a best case scenario here something both these guys can appreciate
plus theyve opened up the middle for the third guy the third guy comes in
john diagrams his path to the middle urinal
the guy goes there
what about eye contact in this situation
well youre still not likely to encounter any but again if you do thats what that buffer zone on either side of hims for
and all three of em are feelin pretty lucky to have it i can tell you that
now if things stay like this
if things stay like this youre fine and if this were some small commuter airport yknow late at night or somethin then these guys could possibly even be home free
but were talkin miami international here this is the big time were talking about s dc s the big jumbo jets dumpin off three four hundred people at a clip
so everybodys gonna be next to somebody which is the last thing any of these guys want
youre in a critical mass situation and this is where a lotta mistakes get made
which brings us to guy number four
here he comes and there he goes
guy spins around and leaves
john and dave watch then
now one thing that i know were going to get asked john especially from women is whether as guys were aware of how utterly stupid this kind of behavior really
well i think we know dave
dont you think we know
i think we do
have to be stupid not to
we did that
dave walks the campus
threads through gorgeous college girls who dont know hes there
if theres anything that causes more anguish in a guy than sports anguish and public restroom anguish and hardware store anguish its the day that he realizes that somehow his
life is half over now and no matter what he tries to tell himself hes not young anymore and hes never going to be young again
then he stops and as any guyll tell you it sucks
a guy in a suit alone in here
faint elevator music plays
i got used to having the beatles and stones called classic rock
then i heard elvis costello on an oldies station
i figured okay who cares at least its on somewhere
but then i hear london calling on muzak
by the clash
but what the hell
im in a suit and i go around all day explaining peoples k plans to them
and stings doing commercials for jaguar
he shakes his head its hopeless
the barber talks while cutting daves hair
the way i see it its like menopause right
except men get it different
it doesnt show ysee
the cramps dont come the hot and cold flashes and you dont have your magazines and drug stores filled with helpful stuff to do about it
but something comes and it hits every guy whos living whether he likes it or not
whether he knows it or not
guy can lose his bleepin mind if he doesnt watch out
he gets a mirror to show dave the back
gives him time to get philosophical
but you know
maybe its for the better
maybe whoever designed all this was afraid to let the men in on what was gonna be happening
like if we knew wed bail or something
you know ahead of time
the bartender wipes the bar down in front of dave
im just telling you what i see
every lousy day
a guyll come in and sit down right where you are
he loosens up a little and then it comes
the road not taken
an unfulfilled life
and other guys theyll come in and dont say a word
the ones who just stare at the mirror
that sounds pretty bleak
i think it goes back to the old times
ancient times you know
when nobody was expected to live past forty
you got to forty
but now that men arent doing that theres a lot more shit up ahead and none of it looks good so they go freak out and make a mess of
things theyll quit their jobs or walk out on their marriages or make some other idiot grandstand move
none of them are happy and every single one of them wishes he did something else with his life and cant figure out how it got this way
every single one of them
a hotshot lawyer is dictating a memo to his secretary
therefore please be advised that in reference to the aforementioned subject matter as per the original agreement dated march two thousand his secretary stops writing
march two thousand
you said that already
shakes his head i started here on the th of march
fifteen years ago
well happy anni what the hell am i doing
why did i even think this would be a good idea to work my ass off every single day of my life
so i could come in here and dictate letters like this
theyre not all like this
you do a lot of good
and what does it get me a twin turbo convertible that i dont even get to drive because im always traveling and renting shitbox cars in other cities where all
i do is take clients out to lunch and tell them how to negotiate their golden parachutes
you ever sit in the drivers seat of one of those renta cars
well my husband usually does the brand new cars not even two thousand miles on them and already they drive like camels
the seats got no cushion left already and youre lucky if you dont need a chiropractor after twenty minutes in one
what do people do in those things
maybe i could get you something
you want something
i want something
i want the number of that hang gliding place out on route
you want to go hang gliding
i want to teach hang gliding
i didnt know you did that
i dont do that
i want to do that
ive always wanted to do that and lots of other things too only im stuck doing this all day long
and i dont even know what this is half the time just that i have to spend every waking hour doing it
so you tell me where the hell does hang gliding fit into that
give me a break
as he starts to leave where are you going
i should have done this a long time ago
what about the letter
put in the usual bullshit
nobodys gonna read it anyway
she sits there
johnny lake lifts a titanium frame up onto the back of a pickup
part of it catches on the lift gate and he swears kicking it
about to really lay into it when the lawyer drives up in his twin turbo convertible and gets out
stunned watches him its two thirty in the afternoon
i dont make the rules
arent you the owner
i do make the rules
sees he means it look there has to i really want to learn this i just quit my job to learn this
be my guest learn it
he kicks the frame again walks off
the lawyer watches
how can you do this
this is the perfect job
driving around in a rusted worthless pickup truck thats about to be repossessed anyway while a guy like you my own age is going around in a porsche carrera
but you get to fly
no you get to fly
i get to hoof this shit up and down these godforsaken hilltops listening to stockbrokers brag about getting lap dances from college coeds and charging the whole thing through the
company expense account while i cant even deduct my blood pressure medication
thats what i get to do
he kicks a rock in the road which almost feels good enough so he kicks another one but this one is buried in the dirt like an iceberg and doesnt
budge ahh shit
and he falls down hobbling on one knee instead
johnny lake waits on the examining table holding ice against his leg
the lawyer sits on the extra chair reading exotic
he holds up a photo a guy in a hammock in paradise
look at this
you got that right
the lawyer shakes his head flips the page
then on lawyers look he shrugs you dont think hes gonna
have to use the glove
then off his look you hurt your knee
he already took the x rays
what if somethings broken
well hes not going in that way
you dont do a rectal to set a guys leg
still the guy looks doubtful
the orthopedic surgeon british familiar comes in with a fresh x ray
well youve done quite a number on yourself
want to see
why should i
i wouldnt know what the hell im looking at
youre the one who went to medical school
dont remind me
then on their looks what
you think i like this
the medical profession
owing my life to the insurance cartel while the rest of the world thinks im so stinking rich
of courseiam im an orthopedic surgeon
ijust dont like people assumingit
and this i am so sick of this bloody thing i cant even tell you
because every time it goes off it means i have to stop doing one thing i dont want to be doing and start doing another thing i dont want to
you call that a life
they look at him
dont know what to say
let me show you something
puts down the x ray goes to a drawer ive been working on this during my free time
not like i get any
he gets an accordion style envelope takes out a ream of typed pages
hands it over to johnny lake
what is it
what is it
its a screenplay
thisll blow the lid off the orthopedic surgery industry
look look here takes it back flips no wait this parts better
here you go
read this and tell me if you dont
he looks up
the lot is filled with ford fiestas
the lawyer and johnny lake drive up
when they pull the door open theres whining from inside
then the bartender from before comes out storms past them and throws his rag down hard as he gets the hell out of there and away from that shit job
as dave walks into frame starts over to his car
well it looks like its time to talk about sex
will you knock it off
dave gets out of his car and walks towards the mall
for the sake of any younger viewers who might still be paying attention during this next segment we will be using certain euphemisms to describe a natural and wonderful thing
that happens among grownups grownups besides your parents that is
dave walks along all the cosmos redbooks etc
probably the fastest growing sector of the u
economy is the sector that conducts surveys asking women what is wrong with men
and in all those surveys there is one main area that shows up constantly at the top of the charts
he stops pulls a euphemisms
dave walks up the aisles filled with delectable things
when i say euphemisms i of course am not suggesting that guys dont have them
guys have plenty of euphemisms
most guys have more euphemisms in a single day and here i am thinking of a day that occurred in the summer between ninth and tenth grades than some women
have in a lifetime or longer in the case of certain math teachers
dave walks outside past a line of schoolkids off a bus
it all goes back to a time millions of years ago when primitive males often had to complete their part of the equation quickly and right away stand ready to
fight off attackers
dave walks past glassed in displays of caveman life
today however women want euphemisms too and this ability in males is no longer as prized as it once was
in fact when modern women describe the qualities theyre looking for in the ideal man the phrase a real fast shooter is usually pretty far down the list
naturally it fell to guys to do something about this
so naturally they did
dave stands outside while kelly and gene come back from walking their dog
in a hurry
one technique for holding back the inevitable is when the guy just when he is about to have his euphemism will hurl himself violently into an iron bed railing and
raise a lump on his head the size of a golf ball
they come in the room shedding clothes
he lifts her carries her to the bed with nothing but pillows against the wall
he stops panicked
theres nothing there
dave watches the light go off
turns back to the camera
in cases where there arent any iron railings a good backup technique can be found right on the end of the cold wet nose of the trusted family dog
camera pans to the window where we hear
just hold on
camera pans back to dave
there are also mental techniques roger and elaine are under the sheets
some good early moaning
as dave comes in holding a mike interview style
one of the most time honored and reliable mental delaying styles is the baseball method taps rogers shoulder hows it going champ
roger pokes his head out of the blanket stays active from the neck down
oh yeah hi
then to dave well the baseball thing
i mean a while ago i was into that big time
you know fooling around with different lineups mixing up the batting order like thinking about what would happen if you took your cleanup guy and made him eighth or something
just something stupid like that you know
stuff youd never really do
and that did the trick
oh hell yeah
i mean i could go all night literally all night just shuffling my pitching staff around or thinking about who i might try and sign at the winter meetings
hang on he goes under the blanket pays more attention to elaine
then comes back
the thing is it got stale
and i found after a while i wasnt enjoying sex or baseball that much
and you dont want to mess with that stuff
so what do you do instead
off his nod you mean like if a train leaves chicago at one oclock and another train leaves denver at two oclock and theyre going at different speeds
shakes his head i cant do train ones
i always end up imagining this beautiful girl on the train and it makes things even worse
pops her head out
what beautiful girl
the girl on the train is always you
roger gives dave a close call look
then goes back to work
dave helps himself makes a sandwich
as you can see a lot of guys are making a tremendous effort here and yet according to certain standards they are still basically lame as hell on almost every
the reason for this is simple women set the standards
takes a bite and not just bedroom standards all standards
because women invented standards
remember the dawn of guys
primate women are still at it pounding roots and dealing with primate kids
primate elaine picking up around the cave
she stumbles on something gross
finally has had it
primate elaine addresses the others
ive been thinking
we need some standards around here
what are standards
what is thinking
the others turn look at her
look back at primate blaine
standards are like rules
things theyll have to do
and things theyll have to stop doing
how about no leaving your dirty smelly loincloths wherever you feel like it and expecting me to do something about it
can that be a standard
that can be one of the first
how about no gnawing on a fish head during sex
there are all kinds of things we can get them to do
theyre stronger than we are
they smell stronger maybe
off their laughter i like the smell
of the men or the rotten fish
theres a difference
more laughing then they turn back to primate elaine
but how will we make them go along
most of them cant even remember which cave to come home to every night
how are they going to remember rules
well give them a look
a special look
a certain look
but we look at them every day
and they still do whatever they want
as the others agree ive been working on this
she turns to primate blonde woman who is holding a gourd
on the look the blonde drops the gourd
and she wasnt even doing anything
agreements and wows go all around
now whos with me
the primate guys come back lugging animal parts
each now has his own rock instead of the giant jagged slabs
what are you doing later
i dont know
probably just stare at the fire
a bunch of us are going over to primate blonde womans cave to see what she does with those gourds
want to come
primate elaines ancestors are still here
tell me about it
they are so ice age
primate roger watches primate elaine examine his new rock
her primate mom and dad hover on the edge of the discussion
i dont get it
what was wrong with the other one
this ones better
its an upgrade
what did he say it was called
an improvement on a previous design
whatd he say
to his wife an upgrade
to primate elaine the guy said there are newer ones coming out thatll make even this one look primitive
theyre getting lighter and rounder every epoch
primate discount manny
boy he must have seen this one coming
then to primate roger i just wanted to know what the difference is between this one and the one you had
you were so excited about it when you got it and now youve gotten rid of it and the only difference i can see is where this one has these
markings painted on
she holds it up something like baseball seams going around
those make it so it travels better
off his look whatd it cost you
a couple wildebeeste steaks and handful of seeds of some kind
i told you
then to his wife did i say he was a bum
whos a bum
are you calling me a bum
no ones calling anyone a bum
im just visiting
you do what you want
who do you think killed your dinner tonight
just take it back
but i cant do that
all sales are final
you can explain it to him
tell him he can keep the steaks but we want the seeds back
to primate roger i dont mean to meddle
but you should listen to your wife
then to primate roger but in this case shes right
to her parents look will you both stop
then to primate roger just take this back
this is totally unreasonable
oh i get it
dont tell me its your time in the moon cycle again he stops cold
stunned by her certain look
historys first in slow motion from several angles the way they do it when buildings explode in much bigger movies
ill take it back
dave strolls among the shoppers tourists etc
he has the rock with him tosses it unconsciously like a baseball
this is basically where we stand today
the only difference is we have way more standards
gives the rock to a kid passing by there are social standards about being sensitive remembering anniversaries listening during conversations not eating soup with your hands or sitting around in
your underwear when companys over
dave goes up the escalator walks through the kind of home stylings section where no other guy would go
everything he talks about is on display in some form
and there are thousands of standards for domestic life involving even more totally un guy concepts like curtains bedspreads napkins special hangers little soaps shaped like fruit and decorative boxes
that hold tissues that already come in a box
while guys left on their own in the wild will develop lifestyles that dont involve any of these things
college roger and college gene stand in their doorway
there is one window a lot of dust and nothing else
i know just what this place needs
they turn around to go buy hockey sticks
a rabbit on a lawn chair drinks beer out of an ashtray
college roger and college gene play indoor death hockey slamming into walls scattering newspapers and pizza boxes as their image freezes
of course even by the most basic standards these two are living like savages
but they honestly dont know this because guys in their natural state arent any more aware of domestic standards than a trout would be aware of the stock market
and this causes women a lot of concern
to him his clean clothes are ready when hes ready to go get them
and they can dry the rest of the way in the drawer
but they dont dry the rest of the way in the drawer they sit there in damp musty unfolded balls and he doesnt even mind and i cant figure that
what is the matter with folding something
what is the matter with waiting for it to be dry
dave unloads a laundry basket on the bed
starts folding the clean clothes and making piles
laundrys a big issue and a deep and puzzling mystery to guys
my own wife michelle for instance is an accomplished sportswriter and mother of an extremely young child yet she is still able to maintain a vigorous clothes cleaning regimen bordering
on the super human
and im not allowed near the stuff
comes in with more hes right
she dumps out the clothes sees what hes doing and takes over doing it better
dave picks up a random blouse shows a label with lots of printing on it
these are clearly secret codes that women intuitively understand but cannot adequately explain just like how a lot of guys understand the infield fly rule without being able to explain
i can explain the infield fly rule
because youre special sweetheart
dave anchors a semi circle with sidra mia karla e and lila
they take turns focus group style
sometimes i think theyre just like tapeworms
i mean tapeworms are just tapeworms thats all they are and all theyll ever be
theyre just these repulsive little parasitic beasts and nobody expects anything different from them because people know thats their nature
and its the same way with guys although a tapeworms more likely to help clean out the garage
they have to be the biggest and they have to be the best
and they can never back down from a challenge
they sleep with your sister and wonder whats wrong with that
they will make a game out of anything
a contest out of anything
give them a grain of sand and they will figure out some game with it
and theyll argue over the rules
off their agreement they leave their dirty dishes everywhere
i cant believe the places ill find some crusted over cereal bowl with yuckola blobs of god knows what in them
and the thing is from his point of view
they really do get cleaned by magic
because i cant take seeing them sit there so i clean them
to karla e i just get him to wash my car when that stuff happens
sweetheart he could wash my car with his tongue and it still wouldnt make up for where i find those dishes sometimes
while they commiserate so now that weve heard your thoughts
the frustration the exasperation
the obvious question comes to mind why go through it
why have guys in your life at all
they look at him
you mean as a choice
you mean like a mature adult choice to have a guy in your life
in spite of everything
like trying to borrow money from you after youve broken up so he can buy something for his new girlfriend
and wondering what the problem was with that
i mean like really not knowing
dave looks at her
they all do
until ill tell you why
there is no good reason thats why
the others turn look her way
i mean dont get me wrong
they really can be fun
you know like a big stupid dog can be fun
i mean not everything has to be so serious in life
you want to be able to do more with someone than just read book reviews together which is something a guy would never do anyway
then as the others but what a guy will do
is at eleven oclock at night hell show up at your door and bring cheese steaks
and he doesnt care that you look all rumply and dreadful from not expecting anyone
he might not even remember that youre a vegetarian and dont eat cheese steaks but that doesnt really matter either
because the point is he wanted one and he cant come out and say it but he didnt want to eat it alone
and youre the person he thought of
off her look nods i cant tell you what that feels like when they do that
a beat and then i swear if they knew how adorable they are sometimes theyd be dangerous
i mean more dangerous
the other girls think about that
the rest of them agree and all high five her
dave leans back from the fray turns to the camera
i think its time for the conclusion now
a sign says under new management
dave is on top of the hill in a rig that the ex lawyer is fastening him into
well now you know where things stand
youve learned a little bit about guys and the critical roles theyve played in the past and in modern society today
and for better or worse theyre here with us to stay so the best thing you can do about it is continue to learn about them by coming to see
this movie lots and lots of times and bringing more and more of your friends back every time you do
because the more people that understand guys the better for everyone
and the more people that as the lawyer launches off he goes
right out of frame and subtitle roger now owns a piece tool set and he has successfully attempted to change his first switchplate
subtitle elaine has an open line of credit with steve
subtitle gene and kelly won the fred and ginger award in three straight ballroom competitions
gene was right they belong together
subtitle sheryl crow gave a concert in central park for half a million people a while back
we werent there but we have it on cd
subtitle richard m
nixon was finally elected president in
he held that position until august when he resigned in disgrace
subtitle agent leopold and agent stearns were fired by the fbi for gross incompetence
they now work in network television
subtitle this man is not really an expert
if you see him dont listen to any of his opinions
subtitle rufino lupenza is an imaginary ballplayer created by the filmmakers to prove a point
however if he did exist and if he were any good the yankees probably would get him
and that would suck
now these are the kinda end credits you like to see
you got the final update thing goin where you find out how all the characters youve been watchin are gonna turn out
you got good music a lively kinda feel and maybe most of all the movie itself isnt too long he reacts now looking down at the tail credits as they
start speeding up
thats how you know its a real movie in my book
thats how you know its not some boring kinda art piece made by these tortured head case kids fresh outta film school youre not gonna come outta this theater talkin
about symbolism or the use of darkness and light or any kinda mumbo jumbo like that you come out of this movie and youre laughin
and thats what i like in a movie a movie thats funny but it doesnt take forever you know
you still got some time to do somethin after maybe go get somethin to eat yknow
because the guys behind the thing knew enough not to drag on and on and as the music fades
and its quiet
a good quiet
hey what do you know
we got through the whole entire thing without saying booger
