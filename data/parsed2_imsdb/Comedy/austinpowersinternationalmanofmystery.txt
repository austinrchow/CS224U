ive set a trap for austin powers
music soul bossanova by quincy jones
we start on a pair of beatle boots and peg top crushed velvet pants walking down the street in rhythm a la saturday night fever
we pan up to reveal austin powers international man of mystery
hes a swinger with medium length mod hair and sideburns and he wears national health services glasses
austin walks along carnaby street taking photographs
it is that perpetual bright sunny day you see in sixties movies
austin bursting with life gives a two handed handshake to a mod freak whos just gotten off a red double decker bus
austin salutes a strolling bobby then comes across two beautiful mod girls who are excited to see him
they all start to twist to the music including the bobby
in the middle of the street three models wait impatiently to be photographed in a makeshift photo shoot area
one wears a short skirted stewardess outfit
one wears a metallic silver pantsuit with matching cowl
the other wears a see through mary quant dress
taking photos alright luv
pout for me baby
we see that austin has very bad english teeth
the model in the stewardess outfit foes on all fours

austin throws the camera in the air behind him
an assistant scrambles and catches it before it hits the ground
get these off to fab magazine right away
austin youve really outdone yourself this time
suggestively we could have another photo session back at my flat
coyly oh behave

so many women so little time
a gaggle of mod girls come towards the shoot site
they recognize austin and scream hysterically

the mob of girls catches up to austin and he runs away
austins in a phone booth with his back turned
the mob runs by
he steps out disguised only by a beard
austin is jiving down the street and comes across a stoned face red coated buckingham palam guard standing at attention just outside his guard box
austin mugs for the guard trying to get him to crack up but to no avail
finally he pulls a big sixties flower from behind the guards head and presents it to him
they both crack up
the girls run by a sixties era photo booth with somebody inside
austin steps out
panels show austin with various exotic models
the fourth panel shows austin with the queen
austin spots a very pregnant hippy girl with a placard that says protest
in a funky font
you might want to protest a bit louder next time luv
the both laugh
the passport opens
we see austins dour photo
then he gives an insane grin showing his bad teeth
the page flips and we see visa stamps from all the exotic places hes been
austin flips a coin into a blind mans cup
the blind man obviously sighted moves the cup to catch the coin
austin wags his finger in a oh you fashion and then proceeds to knee him the balls
austin is being chased around the corner by a gaggle of after a moment austin returns from around the corner with a baton followed by a marching band
the schoolgirls pick up his trail again and he begins to run
a jaguar xke convertible which is decorated with a large union jack pulls beside austin
he jumps over the door into the moving convertible racing off just ahead of the crowd
the driver of the jag is austins associate mrs
kensington a beautiful woman in her thirties
they drive against obvious rear projection of s london

austin pulls off the mod girls wig
she is a male assassin
the assassin comes to and leaps to his feet
kensington knocks his feet from under him
the assassin hits the ground and pulls out a dagger
kensington kicks the knife out of his hand and austin gets him in a head lock from behind
wheres doctor evil
the assassin falls forward
a spear protrudes from his back
austin sees dr
evil as he runs through a door
they give chase
evil climbs into an egg chair
ive got you again dr
the chair fills with a white mist
unseen through mist not this time
calling out see you in the future mr
before the doors close the white cat jumps in the egg chair
a sign on the egg reads cryogenic my god
hes freezing himself
austin begins firing at the egg chair
the ceiling opens up and the egg rises through the opening
everything begins to rumble
rocket exhaust pours out of the ceiling
the bobs big boy rocket begins to lift off
people outside the club react to the rocket
the bobs big boy rocket leaves the atmosphere
bigglesworth is pressed to the window like one of those stuffed garfields
shivering ill be back mr
powers when free love is dead and greed and avarice once again rule the world
a blip appears on the radar screen

basil exposition now aged years command gilmour and nicolai borschevsky a russian general put on extreme weather gear over their uniforms
as you know gentlemen dr
evil had himself frozen in
soon after austin powers volunteered to have himself frozen in the event dr
evil should ever return
we believe dr
evil has begun yet another plot to take over the world
and that gentlemen is why were here
outstanding re cap exposition
command gilmour opens a vault door
cold mist escapes
they pass a row of cryogenic holding berths each containing a naked person in suspended animation a la demolition man
they pass gary coleman evel knieval with cape and vanilla ice all in suspended animation
they pass a now empty berth with a plate that reads john who is this austin powers
is he a british operative
no he worked freelance an internationally renowned swinging photographer by day and the ultimate gentlemen spy by night
finally they come across austin powers he is naked
his hands cover up his private parts
the look on his face suggests oh my god my bits and pieces are cold
his glasses are frosted over
he is very hairy
on pa attention stage one laser cutting beginning
lasers begin to cut austin out of the ice in one huge cube

technicians lead a half asleep austin to a screened area where only his feet and head are visible

on pa cleansing complete
stage five evacuation beginning

we can hear the sound of pee entering the he pees for a while then a little longer
and then even longer still
the stream seems to be subsiding
then begins stronger than ever
he is still peeing
finally it stops
he begins peeing again
a little longer
then in short staccato bursts
the it stops
the cryogenic state of austin powers is now completed
austin lies in a bed tilted up in an extreme angle a la dr
nurse technicians administer injections and monitor electrodes ivs and other biological sensors
weakly where am i
youre in the ministry of defense
youve been cryogenically frozen for thirty years
shouting the shouting is a temporary side effect of the unfreezing process
yes im having trouble controlling emdash shouting you might also experience a slight fever dry mouth and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation
austin this is commander gilmour strategic command and general borschevsky russian intelligence

a multi colored psychedelic jumbo jet with austins logo on the tailpiece

austin and vanessa sit on beanbag chairs
vanessa works on her lap top
pretty groovy jumbo jet eh
how does a hot chick like you end up working at the ministry of defense
i went to oxford and excelled in several subjects but i ended up specializing in foreign languages
i wanted to travel see the world
in my last year i was accepted into the m
in the cultural studies sector
i thought i was off on an exciting career but my job was to read everything printed in every country
its very boring
my whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in farsi
if i do well with this case i finally get promoted to field operative
thats fascinating vanessa
listen why dont we go into the back and shag
i beg your pardon
ive been frozen for thirty years man i want to see if my bits and pieces are still working
my wedding tackle
my meat and two veg
i know that you must be a little confused but we have a very serious situation at hand
i would appreciate it if youd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest
have you ever made love to a chigro
you know a chigro emdash part chinese part negro emdash chigro
offended we dont use the term negro anymore
its considered offensive
youre supposed to say colored now right
spotting the flight attendants heres the stewardesses
bring on the sexy stews
the stewardesses enter

can i get your telephone number
mock sexy sure its easy to remember
writing on his hand its film
we have to prepare the craft for take off now
when we land ill give you a tinkle on the telling bone
the flight attendant gives him a chilly stare and then exits
she must be frigid
theres two things i know about life one americans will never take to soccer
two swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag
theyre shag mad man
let me ask you a question vanessa and be honest
do i make you horny
do i make you horny
randy you know
to you am i eros manifest
i hope this is part of the unfreezing process
listen vanessa im a swinger emdash thats what i do i swing
i understand that mr
powers but let me be perfectly clear with you perhaps to the point of being insulting
i will never have sex with you ever
if you were the last man on earth and i was the last woman on earth and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for
procreation i still would not have sex with you
austin is oblivious
whats you point vanessa
time has passed
vanessas lap top beeps
youve got mail
angle on the computer screen
its basil exposition
this is basil exposition from british intelligence
theres a company in las vegas called virtucon that we think may be linked to dr
many of the virtucon executives gamble at the hotel casino where youll be staying
thats the first place you should look
well im off to the chat rooms
thank you exposition
oh and austin emdash yes
vanessa closes her lap top
over loudspeaker ladies and gentlemen were beginning our final descent into las vegas international airport
flight attendants will be coming by to collect your drinks and ill ask you at this time to please return to the main cabin and put your bean bags in
the upright position
austin and vanessa fasten the seatbelts on their bean bags
we see a planes lights landing at night
music psychedelic wa wa pedal funky drummer beat title graphic the trip using a sequence of snap zooms colored projections and flashing lights we see austin dance crazily a la
bob fosse with a go go girl in a bikini with the austin powers logo body painted on her midriff
the sequence lasts five seconds and is very groovy
sights and sounds of las vegas icons at night welcome to las vegas sign
the giant cowboy whose arm waves
the montage ends on the modern skyline of las vegas
face again unseen ladies and gentlemen its been a long time but im back
its all gone perfectly to plan except for one small flaw
because of a technical error my right arm was not frozen
i was therefore by definition only partially frozen
angle on evil associate mustafa
he is terrified and sweaty eyes darting left and right
but my design was perfect
your autonomic functions were shut down and even though your arm wasnt frozen the aging was retarded therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left
cant you see im only half a man
look at me im a freak
he holds up his older right arm which looks normal
evil all you need to do is emdash holding up tennis ball work with this tennis ball
squeeze it for twenty minutes a day
a few months of that and itll be just as strong as the other arm
and look what youve done to mr
who is now totally hairless with a fringe of white hair around its ears like dr
we could not anticipate feline complications due to the reanimation process emdash face unseen silence
evil presses a button
mustafas chair tips back and he falls backwards into a pit
blood curdling scream ahhhhhhhhh
face unseen let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure
scar on his cheek
gentlemen lets get down to business
more muffled screams
weve got a lot of work to do
muffled someone help me
im still alive only im very badly burned
slightly distracted some of you i know some of you im meeting for the first time
muffled hello up there
can someone call an ambulance
im in quite a lot of pain
very frustrated youve all been gathered here to form my evil cabinet
he picks up a white phone and murmurs into it
muffled if somebody can open the retrieval hatch down here i could get out
see i designed this device myself and
good im glad you found me
listen im very badly burned so if you could just emdash sfx muffled gunshot muffled ow
you shot me
muffled you shot me right in the arm
why did emdash sfx muffled gunshot
let me go around the table and introduce everyone
founder of the militant wing of the salvation army
random task is a large korean man in a butlers uniform
a korean ex wrestler evil handyman extraordinaire
show them what you do
he stands up bows then takes off his shoe and throws it
it knocks the head off a sculpture across the room
thank you random task
patty obrien a small wiry irishman with fiery eyes
ex irish assassin
around patty obriens wrist is a charm bracelet
a superstitious man he leaves a tiny keepsake on every victim he kills
scotland yard would love to get their hands on that piece of evidence
heavy irish accent yes theyre always after me lucky charms
everyone in the room tries to keep a straight face
why does everyone always laugh when i say that
they are after me lucky charms
they cannot contain their laughter
through suppressed laughter its a television commercial with this little cartoon leprechaun who is a benevolent imp who is very concerned that these children will steal his lucky charms which
are foodstuffs fashioned into various shapes emdash hearts moons clovers what have you
pause its a long story
finally i come to my number two man
his name number two
number two a good looking year old man with an eye patch
for thirty years number two has run virtucon the legitimate face of my evil empire
he hits a button
the conference table slowly rotates to reveal a large illuminated map of the united states dotted by various miniature models
over the last thirty years virtucon has grown by leaps and bounds
about fifteen years ago we changed from volatile chemicals to the communication industry
we own cable companies in thirty eight states
the thirty eight states illuminate on the map
in addition to our cable holdings we own a steel mill in cleveland
a steel mill miniature illuminates in cleveland
shipping in texas
a ship off the coast of texas illuminates
oil refineries in seattle
an oil refinery illuminates in seattle
and a factory in chicago that makes miniature models of factories
the miniature model factory lights up in chicago
we also own the franklin mint which makes decorative hand painted theme plates for collectors
holds up plate some plates like the gone with the wind series have gone up in value as much as two hundred and forty percent but as with any investment
there is some risk involved
gentlemen i have a plan
its called blackmail
the royal family of britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world
either the royal family pays us an exorbitant amount of money or we make it look like prince charles the heir to the throne has had an affair outside of
marriage and therefore they would have to divorce
there is an uncomfortable silence
evil prince charles did have an affair
he admitted it and they are now divorced actually
people have to tell me these things
ive been frozen for thirty years throw me a bone here
pausing ok no problem
heres my second plan
back in the sixties i had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a laser
using this laser we punch a hole in the protective layer around the earth which we scientists call the ozone layer
slowly but surely ultraviolet rays would pour in increasing the risk of skin cancer
that is unless the world pays us a hefty ransom
there is another uncomfortable silence
umm that also has already happened
pause oh hell lets just do what we always do
lets hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage
pause gentlemen its come to my attention that a breakaway russian republic called kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the united nations in a few days
heres the plan
we get the warhead and we hold the world ransom
dramatic pause there is an uncomfortable pause
dont you think we should ask for more than a million dollars
a million dollars isnt that much money these days
all right then
dramatic pause there is another uncomfortable pause
virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year
pleasantly surprised oh really
slightly irritated one hundred billion dollars
pause ok make it happen
remember when we froze your semen you said that if it looked like you werent coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you
would live forever
well after a few years we got sort of impatient
evil i want you to meet your son
calling out scott
scott evil walks out
he is fifteen grungy and wears a kurt cobain t shirt
im your father dr
emotional i have a son
i have a son
everyone i have a son
gesturing to globe someday scott this will all be yours
i havent seen you my whole life and now you show up and want a relationship
i hate you
vanessa and austin drive in his perfectly preserved jag
youve preserved my jag
yes weve had it retrofitted with a secure cellular phone an on board computer and a global geosynchronous positioning device
oh and finally this
the glove compartment revolves to reveal a display of various dental hygiene products emdash floss toothpaste toothbrush dental mirror and cleaning tool
let me guess
the floss is garotte wire the toothpaste contains plastic explosives and the toothbrush is the detonation device
i dont know how to put this really
well there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry
whats wrong with my teeth
the union jack emblazoned jaguar pulls up to the front door
vanessa carries her compact flight attendant bag and austin takes his two bright red oversized leatherette samsonite suitcases
which side of the bed do you want
youre going to sleep on the sofa

vanessa sees it

austin casually dials the phone while looking at his palm
after a beat we hear a loud male voice coming through the handset
through handset hello

austin covers the mouthpiece and whispers to vanessa
i got her answering machine
austin and vanessa walk through the casino
austin gives people two handed handshakes
they stare like hes a freak
i love las vegas man
oh i forgot my x ray glasses

its important that it be a generic name so that we dont draw attention to ourselves
austin and vanessa join the high rollers table
number two is there complete with eyepatch
on one side of him is a beautiful italian woman a la sophia loren in a white dress with a white kerchief on her head

vanessa is mortified
indicating vanessa this is my wife enid

he extends his hand to shake
austin extends his hand but misses and begins to shake the bimbos breast
there is an awkward pause
austin takes off his glasses
rescuing him number two

indicating italian woman this is my italian confidential secretary
italian accent my name is alotta quickly alotta fagina
im sorry im just not getting it

listen we should go back to the room but first i have to go to the naughty chair and see a man about a dog
he heads to the rest room
number two has been watching them
he presses a button
austin enters to see a gregarious texan in a huge cowboy hat
austin enters a stall
the texan enters the adjoining stall
good luck buddy
you dont buy food you rent it
too right youth
austin sits down
behind him a panel slides open revealing patty obrien
his charm bracelet jingles
austin looks back
pattys bracelet is now garotte wire
he wraps it around austins throat
austin gets his thumbs between the wire and certain death
grunting uh uh
the texan can only see austins feet which are moving about frantically
he can hear the hey pardner just relax dont force it
use some creative visualization
austin grunts and snaps his head back into patty obriens crotch
patty obrien groans in agony
austin breaks free of the charm bracelet garotte grabs patty obriens head and pulls it between his legs so that it hovers above the toilet bowl
who does number two work for
show that turd whos boss
who does number two work for
quietly straining go to hell
austin drops pattys head into the toilet and flushes
we hear muffled gurgling sounds from patty obrien
the texan hears all of this and is now concerned
austin reaches into patty obriens wallet
we see his dr
evil id card and alottas virtucon business card with her address
austin is leaving his stall
the texan can see patty obriens dead body head first in the toilet
jesus christ what did you eat
patty obriens lifeless hand hits the floor
the charms come tumbling out a heart a moon a star and a clover
a second later a blue diamond falls out
music psychedelic wa wa pedal funky drummer beat title graphic love power austin and the go go girl dance crazily
vanessa is on the phone on the bed sifting through photos and files on dr
evil virtucon etc
in the background through an open door we see that austin is asleep on the couch
into phone hello mum
an older mrs
kensington sits in her suburban english front room
on phone oh hello vanessa
how was the flight
oh god no i made him sleep on the couch
in the background we see austin get off the couch
he is very naked and very hairy
a strategically placed vase of flowers blocks his naughty bits from view
im proud of you
because you managed to resist austin powers charms
austin moves towards the bathroom away from the flowers
right in the nick of time vanessa holds up a photo of number two and looks at it blocking his naughty parts

random task and another bodyguard exit the limo and secure the area
we see that the binoculars belong to vanessa
she and austin are on a stakeout
austins jag is in the background
a limousine has just pulled up
let me see
austin pulls into frame an extremely long telephoto lens attached to his vintage camera
two more bodyguards leave the building and approach the limo

austin begins snapping pictures all the while changing her look touching her hair
pout for me vanessa

they walk along the brightly lit streets laughing enjoying each others company
austin gives vanessa a pet rock
she graciously accepts
austin and vanessa stroll against a changing series of backgrounds emdash neon signs vegas icons dice showgirls etc
sounds of moans and groans
we see austins backside sticking out above a piece of furniture then vanessas high heeled leg straining upwards
watch out youre on my hair

there is an awkward silence
shes about to kiss him then he pulls away
its not that im drunk im just beginning to see what my mum was talking about
pause what was my mother like back in the sixties
im dying to know
sentimental she was very groovy
she was so in love with your dad
if there was one other cat in this world that could have loved your mum and treated her as well as you dad did it was me
but unfortunately for yours truly that train has sailed
austin hears snoring
he looks over and sees vanessa asleep
a distinctive phone rings and a austin opens one of his funky suitcases to reveal a picture phone
its basil exposition on an airplane
on the picture phone hello austin this is basil exposition from british intelligence
thank you for confirming the link between dr
evil and virtucon
find out what part virtucon plays in something called project vulcan

austin looks over at vanessas sleeping figure
shes working on another lead right now

thank you basil
oh and austin emdash knowing yes
let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation
theres one more thing austin
austin looks at alottas virtucon business card
austin is in a dark penthouse suite
austin passes a piece of art that is very suggestive of the female anatomy
he goes over to a credenza where there is a briefcase
he opens it
austins photographing the dossier with his miniature camera pendant
photographing give it to me baby
we now see that the document outlines all of virtucons holdings in a flow chart fashion
pout for me luv
one side of the chart is labeled secret projects
under that we see human organ trafficking carrot top movie and in close up emdash project vulcan
we see schematics for some sort of subterranean probe and a cross section of the earth labeled crust mantel core
and im spent
the front door opens
you seem surprised to see me

what and watch all my earnings go
smug down the toilet

virtucons main interest is in cable television but they do have a subterranean construction division yes
how did you know
smug i didnt baby you just told me
its for the mining industry mr
we can talk about business later
but first let me slip into something more comfortable
music the look of love by sergio mendez and brazil alotta goes behind a japanese screen
in silhouette she takes off her clothes and puts on a robe
she opens a pair of sliding doors to reveal an elaborate japanese bath grotto
she slips off her robe revealing a dr
evil logo tattoo on her shoulder and enters the water
id rather talk about number two

austin takes off his clothes
he is extremely hairy
he goes in
alotta produces a soapy sponge and swims over
may i wash you
she washes his back
behind his back she pulls out his wallet and looks through it
angle on his identification
it reads austin powers international man of mystery
in japan men come first and women come second
or sometimes not at all
care for some saki
sak i it to me
alotta pours them saki
alotta unscrews the diamond in her ring
a sign on the inside of her ring reads relaxation pills
she drops two pills into his drink
austin takes a sip
his eyes glaze over
hes instantly woozy
how do you feel mr
i feel extreme relaxation
a big bubble comes to the surface right in front of austin
reciting poem pardon me for being rude it was not me it was my food
it just popped up to say hello and now its gone back down below
thats very clever
do you know any other poems
reciting in a lofty tone milk milk lemonade
round the corner fudge is made

she notices his terrible teeth close up

seven soldiers come in
they are immediately attracted to the fembots
they throw down their guns and come to the girls zombie like
when they get within range guns pop out of the fembots bras and begin firing killing the guards
thank you herr doctor
i like to see girls of that caliber
by caliber i mean both the barrel size of their guns and the high quality of their character
that would be the video feed from kreplachistan
evil and number two watch a large screen
we see stock footage of a russian warhead
we cut into a close up of russian soldiers being taken prisoner by virtucon soldiers in the front of a military vehicle
gentlemen phase one is complete
the warhead is ours

one million dollars
the un representatives are confused
number two coughs
one hundred billion dollars
the representatives argue amongst themselves
evil angry doctor evil
i didnt spend six years in evil medical school to be called mister
evil it is the policy of the united nations not to negotiate with terrorists
fine have it your way
gentlemen you have five days to come up with one hundred billion dollars
if you fail to do so well set off the warhead and destroy the world
you cant destroy the world with a single warhead
the screen goes blank
to evil associates gentlemen in exactly five days from now we will be one hundred billion dollars richer
laughing ha ha ha ha
slightly louder ha ha ha ha
laughing with him ha ha ha ha
louder again and even more evil and maniacal ohhhh ahhhhhh
pause quieter ohhh hmmmm
pause very quiet hmn
there is an uncomfortable pause because clearly we should have faded to black
the evil associates look around the room not knowing what to do with themselves
i think im going to watch some tv
they exit the frame awkwardly
austin and vanessa enter past two british military policeman
there is a communications center a makeshift armory bunks etc
we see basil dressed as the vegas era elvis
austin vanessa let me bring you up to speed
evil has high jacked a nuclear warhead from kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one hundred billion dollars

thank you exposition
only two things scare me and one is nuclear war
whats the other
whats the other thing youre scared of
shudders nomads you know
they smell like cabbage
suffering him indeed
if we could get back to the business at hand
its one thing to have a warhead its quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it
maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle
hands him the photos ive uncovered the details on project vulcan
its a new subterranean warhead delivery system
good god and underground missile
weve long feared such a development
when did you find that out austin
austin did some reconnaissance work at alotta faginas penthouse last night

yes virtucon runs a tour of their facilities every hour
i suggest we pose as tourists and do site level reconnaissance
top drawer kensington
oh austin i want you to meet somebody
basil waves to an extremely frail elderly british lady
austin this is my mother mrs
shes in from tunbridge wells in kent

austin hauls off and punches the lady in the face
my god austin what have you done

exposition to a cot
through pain who is that man

austin you have a lot of explaining to do

you must admit she is rather mannish
no offense but if thats a woman it looks like shes been beaten with an ugly stick
look at her hands baby

pause oh and austin
basil escorts his mother out
austin may i have a word with you

he picks up his new pair emdash reebok shaq cross trainer pumps
he pumps them too much and they explode
austin looks out his window at the lonely city below
we see the cds hes just purchased including sergeant peppers and burt bacharachs greatest hits
austin goes over to the kitchenette and puts a can of unopened campbells tomato soup in the microwave and turns it on
it explodes in a shower of sparks and soup
he puts the cd on a record player and drops the needle
the noise is awful

weve heard from scott now lets hear from you
the details of my life are quite inconsequential
thats not true doctor
please tell us about your childhood
yes of course
go ahead etc
very well where should i begin
my father was a relentlessly self improving boulangerie owner from belgium with low grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery
my mother was a fifteen year old french prostitute named chloe with webbed feet
my father would womanize he would drink he would make outrageous claims like he invented the question mark
sometimes he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy
a sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament
my childhood was typical
summers in rangoon luge lessons
in the spring wed make meat helmets
if i was insolent i was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds
pretty standard really
at the age of twelve i received my first scribe
at the age of fifteen a zoroastrian named vilma ritualistically shaved my testicles
there really is nothing like a shawn scrotum
at the age of eighteen i went off to evil medical school
angle on the therapist and the group
they are stunned

faintly im going to go across the street and get you some sherbert
austin and vanessa come to a door marked project vulcan top secret
they walk through
inside scientists wearing head to toe radiation suits surround and inspect a huge diamond encrusted drill bit
this is the strongest sharpest drill bit ever produced by man
it weighs fifteen metric tones and can bore through a mile thick bedrock of solid granite in seven seconds
a security guard and the tour guide take a head count
they notice austin and vanessas empty seats on the tram
the guard speaks into his walkie talkie

there they are
two security guys jump on either side of the steamroller
vanessa wrestles the machine gun off on and pushes him away
austin punches the other one off
im going to floor it
he engages a lever

two security guards jump in front of the steamroller
they are acting like theyre frozen ad if in the headlights of a fast approaching car
where did you learn to shoot
where did you learn to drive
steamroller is now yards away
the other army guy is still frozen in the path of the oncoming steamroller
austin watch out
looking around where

the shifter breaks off along with a gaggle of wares
he desperately jams on the breaks
blood and guts
by now austin and vanessa are right by the door
they run out into the hallway
the coast is clear
thank god austin we made it
yes act naturally and well split this scene the way we came in vanessa
from behind a hand knocks vanessa and austin out
it is random task flanked by four security we see the aftermath
several workmen sweep up the blood and guts with large squeegees and brooms
one of them turns to reveal steamroller accident response team written on his jumpsuit
another workman leans down to the body with a hand broom and dust pail to sweep up blood
zoom in on the steamrolled army guys id tag which reads steve harwin
it is a pleasant marcus welby like ranch style house

a giant canvas falls unveiling an ultra high tech diamond bladed subterranean bore emdash the vulcan
it is rather phallic
under his breath to vanessa does that make you horny
under her breath not now austin
the worlds most powerful subterranean drill
on screen stock footage of volcanoes erupting and animated charts of magma squirting through the earths layers
voice over so powerful it can penetrate the earths crust delivering a kiloton nuclear warhead into the planets hot liquid core
upon detonation every volcano on the planet will erupt
the various representatives are abuzz
behind the british delegation sits basil exposition
to his right sits mrs
exposition with a hideous black eye
why should we pay him the money
hes only got one warhead and hes going to detonate it deep underground
the light shifts towards dramatic as he speaks my god man dont you understand
it wont just be active volcanoes inactive ones will erupt as well
seven eighths of the earths land mass will be deluged with hot magma
tectonic plates will shift causing massive earthquakes
imagine no united kingdom
think of it no cricket no tea no freshly toasted crumpets smothered with devonshire clotted cream the diving mystery of stonehenge
imagine severing forever the continuity of britannic majesty the demise of this sceptered isle this jewel this england
any word from powers
back to normal im afraid weve lost contact with him
evil it seems we have no choice but to pay your ransom
gentlemen your deadline is in three hours
you have your instructions
the screen goes black
come join us for dinner wont you mr

one more peep out of you and youre grounded
a private army soldier grabs austin and vanessa
evil hits a button
one whole wall slides out to reveal a tank
powers vanessa some friends of mine are joining us for dinner
theyre quite delighted youll be part of the meal
the soldier takes austin and vanessa to the tank and puts them in the dipping mechanism
evil do you really expect them to pay
powers i expect them to die
even after they pay me the money im still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma
to guard all right guard begin the unnecessarily slow moving dipping mechanism
the guard do so
austin and vanessa begin to descend slowly towards the surface of the water
release the sharks
to the room all the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads
i figure every creature deserves a warm meal
clearing her throat nervously dr
yes what is it
youre interrupting my moment of triumph
its about the sharks
since you were frozen theyve been placed on the endangered species list
we tried to get some but it will take months to clear up the red tape
to austin mr
powers were going to lower you in a tank of piranhas with laser beams attached to their heads
frau clears her throat again
what is it now
well we experimented with lasers but you would be surprised at how heavy they are
they actually outweighed the piranha themselves and the fish well they sank to the bottom and died
i have one simple request emdash sharks with friggin laser beams attached to their heads and it cant be done
remind me again why i pay you people
what do we have
theyre mutated sea bass
are they ill tempered
please allow me to demonstrate
frau farbissina throws a leg of lamb attached to a rope towards the tank where the water bubbles and sea bass arch through the air
the sea bass devour the lamb
she pulls the rope back
the lamb has been eaten to the bare bone
mutated ill tempered sea bass it is
to the room come lets return to dinner
close the tank
arent you going to watch them
theyll get away
no well leave them alone and not actually witness them dying and well just assume it all went to plan
i have a gun in my room
give me five seconds ill come back and blow their brains out
you just dont get it do you
evil presses a button the wall closes back over the tank
austin and vanessa slowly descend towards the water
they can see the water bubbling beneath them
whats your plan
just then a sea bass jumps out of the water just missing austin
first i plan to soil myself
then i plan to regroup and think about the next move
i always keep this on me just in case
she pulls out a container of dental floss
all right i get it
i have bad teeth
you have to understand in britain in the sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth
it didnt matter
no no no
well use the floss to get to the ledge
give it to me
austin takes the container and draws out four feet of dental floss and spins the container above his head like a bolo
he throws it and it wraps around a radiator and it catches like a grappling hook
austin begins drawing out the floss to take up the slack
meanwhile the slow dipping mechanism is edging towards the sea bass
unfortunately austin is still drawing out the floss
he keeps pulling out floss
more floss still
the mechanism continues to sink
finally the floss line goes taut
austin ties it off high on the pole of the slow dipping mechanism
austin holds out his hand like a surgeon emdash vanessa places a tube of toothpaste in his hand
meanwhile the guard is reaching to undo the floss
austin places the open tube on his palm aimed at the guard
vanessa whistles at the guard loudly
he turns around
austin judo chops the toothpaste tube sending a stream of toothpaste into the guards eyes
screaming rubbing his eyes my eyes
austin folds the tube across the top of the wire grabbing both ends
hold on vanessa
she grabs onto him and they slide down the floss to safety right as the dipping mechanism goes under the water
meanwhile the guard waits for them with toothpaste smeared all over his face
he and austin struggle
the guard manages to get austin pinned to the ground austins head dangling over the water
sea bass circle
the water boils dangerously close to austins head
shouting austin watch out
austin flips the guard over
the sea bass chew the guards head off like a blender
not a good time to lose ones head
thats not the way to get ahead in life
its a shame he wasnt more headstrong
they head out a door
angle on the headless torso
the name tag reads john smith
it is a sports bar type restaurant that has scantily clad at a table we see fifteen or so twenty something guys scouting chicks drinking mugs of beer

vanessa goes out the door
vanessa starts climbing up the ladder
austin tries to turn the cart around in the narrow corridor
he begins a twenty seven point turn
evil scott and the evil associates finish dinner
come everyone let us repair to the main chamber
project vulcan is about to begin
scott are you coming

under his breath blow me

they all go towards a giant door with the radiation symbol painted on it
austins still trying to turn the cart around
pull back to reveal emdash the cart is completely wedged perpendicularly in the corridor
austin jumps out and starts running down the hall
austin comes to a t in the hall and goes around the corner
he sees two guards and ducks into a door
inside are seven fembots lounging in various seductive poses on sixties furniture emdash egg chairs trapezes round furry bed etc
music sexy matt helm type theme hello hello
powers care to have a little fun
looking at his watch no actually i have to save the world
he runs towards to door to exit
suddenly a pair of female legs drop and wrap around austins neck and lift him up
his feet leave the floor
another fembot cartwheels up to austin
nozzles pop out of the tips of the fembots bra
is it cold in here
a cloud of multicolored gas spews from the nozzles
austin is overcome
the room starts to spin
evil sits into his chair with his radiation suit on
arm the probe
a small electric flatbed comes in carrying the nuclear warhead
a phalanx of dr
evils soldiers run beside it
the cart approaches the subterranean probe and the warhead is loaded up into its tail
austin is on the bed being held down by the fembots
psychedelic music plays
projected colored swirling lights flash
the fembots swirl around seductively
delirious ive got to get dr
eyes closed fingers in his ears margaret thatcher naked on a cold day

vanessa leads fifteen commandos on atcs across the sand
two fembots guard the door and five are on the bed in come hither poses

au contraire i think you cant resist me
music sexy matt helm type theme austin starts his seductive dance
he does a quick head count of the fembots reaches out of frame pulls out eight cigarettes put them in his mouth and lights them with a blowtorch
he throws seven cigarettes one by one
each cigarette lands perfectly in a different fembots mouth
austin smokes the remaining cigarette
austin begins to do a seductive striptease
the fembots are aroused
he takes off his shirt revealing his hairy chest and focuses his sexual energy on one fembot
she begins to shake violently her head shaking back and forth like in jacobs ladder
eventually her head explodes
austin is now stripped down to his union jack bikini briefs and turns to another fembot
her head explodes
he takes off his shoes and throws them away cavalierly
then he tosses down his lit cigarette and grinds it with his bare foot
he gives a look of disguised pain
he mouths i love you to another fembot
her head explodes
he does the ill call you hand signal to yet another fembot whose head explodes
austin does a hip thrust to another and her head explodes
austin leans over and wags his rump to the two remaining fembots
oh i fell over
their heads explode simultaneously
all the fembots are lying on the floor smoking
just then vanessa enters flanked by a couple of commandos
she surveys the scene and looks at austin in his briefs
the commandos salute austin
its not what it looks like vanessa
to the commandos at ease boys
glancing down likewise
i can explain
they attacked me
gas came out of her
well and then they
i believe you austin
hold on a tick let me put on my togs
austin and vanessa lead fifteen commandos into the chamber and gunfire breaks out
two catwalks run the length of the chamber meeting at the door to the control area
the commandos split into two groups and lob grenades at the private army soldiers who are guarding the stairs leading to the catwalks
they go flying
the alarm goes off
activate the blast shutters
metal shutters automatically cover the windows overlooking the probe mechanism
launch the subterranean probe
the giant probe engine begins to throb and whirl
the tip of the spinning probe suddenly strikes the floor of the chamber and burrows into the earth with atomic force
smoke and debris explode upwards
the entire chamber quakes violently emdash eight on the richter scale
we have penetration
subterranean detonation emdash two minutes and coun ting
austin vanessa and three commandos are pinned down behind several virtucon barrels another four guards block their way
austin goes to shoot but hes out of bullets
austin and vanessa run along the catwalk towards the control room
theyre directly in the path of ten follow me
were going to have to jump over the rail
are you crazy
they continue to run towards the guards behind some stacked barrels
two obvious stunt doubles run out from behind the barrels in a continuous motion instead of austin and vanessa and diver over the rail
they are making progress on the other catwalk
they have landed safely but are surrounded by five private army soldiers armed to the teeth emdash one has a bazooka one has a flamethrower one has a gatling gun
they see austin and throw down their weapons pulling out knives
one of the private soldiers runs at austin and he stabs him
another soldier runs at austin and austin also stabs him
a third private army soldier runs at austin
austin does the stabbing motion
out of ammo
vanessa unleashes a series of kicks knocking them all out
austin begins to enter

austin enters the control area
a virtucon army man fires at him
austin returns fires shooting up some electrical equipment
live wires dangle dangerously
austin sees mr
bigglesworth running out a read door
austin heads for the door until he smacks into an invisible force field
he turns and sees a bank of old fashioned computers labeled destructacon
good afternoon mr
powers im the destructacon
im programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point
you might as well surrender
resistance is futile
your odds of survival are to well destructacon you have quite a head on your shoulders i dare to coin

he stands there menacing missing one shoe
exposed wires are everywhere

austin throws the drink at random tasks feet
it lands in front of him on a pile of exposed wires
electricity travels through the big gulp up random tasks wet sock electrocuting him
he begins to smoke and then dies
a kiloton explosion from deep in the earth rocks the control area
different volcanoes around the world
lava spews and flows
austin dives in slow motion towards the abort button
he flies through the air for an inordinate length of time
slow motion distortion nooooooo
his hand lands on the button

rocket exhaust pours out of the hole in the ceiling
austin and vanessa run out the door into the

austin and vanessa draw towards each other preparing for a passionate kiss
just as their lips are about to touch however they are interrupted by a strong wind and the noise of a helicopter overhead
their hair is blown all about and the waves are whipped into a frenzy
