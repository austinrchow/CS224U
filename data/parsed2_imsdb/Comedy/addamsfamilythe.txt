by larry wilson and caroline thompson rewrite by paul rudnick based on the characters of charles addams april a group of carolers their eager faces upturned sings an endless and
cloying roundelay of little drummer boy
they sing with self righteous good cheer
as they pompously begin their umpteenth verse the camera slowly pans up the addams mansion past the black wreath on the front door past broken windows weather beaten shingles a
where the addams family members gomez morticia granny pugsley wednesday and lurch their faithful butler gleefully pour a cauldron of bubbling steaming pitch over the edge
the clock is a perfect replica of the addams family house down to the creaking shutter
it chimes the hour
in one window a little mechanical gomez bends a mechanical morticia back until shes almost off her feet and plants a kiss between her clockwork decolletage
one two three mechanical kisses counting toward seven oclock
in another window a mechanical pugsley hangs a mechanical wednesday from a noose on a gallows up and down
meanwhile little bursts of fog float off the rooftop where a little mechanical granny cranks her fog machine
the front door of the house pops open and a mechanical lurch appears and begins sweeping
just then thing the disembodied hand with the full bodied personality climbs into view over the back of the clock
thing leaps to the floor and scampers down the hall
follows thing along the hallway
he runs past a couple of doors past a pair of legs in pajamas feet in bedroom slippers
he skids to a halt and back tracks to the legs
he pulls on the cuff of the pajama bottoms
they belong to gomez who stands in the doorway to gomez wears a fez and a smoking jacket over his pajamas
even at this early hour he puffs on his trademark cigar
gomez is all enthusiasm or all despair
at the moment he radiates unfathomable woe
think of it thing
hes been gone for twenty five years
for twenty five years weve attempted to contact fester in the great beyond
the room is a dusty cobweb filled long unoccupied shrine to gomezs lost brother fester
gomez drifts in from the doorway
the room has remained untouched since festers disappearance as a teenager
the thick coating of dust and cobwebs adorns the mementoes of a rapscallions youth a football pennant from alcatraz headless sports trophies a high school photo with all the other
students keeping as much distance from fester as possible
as he lovingly and morosely surveys the room and for twenty five years nothing
not a whisper not a clue
im beginning to think my my brother truly is lost
thing tugs at his cuff pulling him towards the galloping ahead of gomez thing leaps onto an old fashioned door latch and the door swings open into gomez approaches the
asleep on scarlet satin sheets is
gazing at morticia look at her i would die for her
i would kill for her
either way what bliss
low voiced incisive and subtle with morticia smiles are rare
the ghostly whiteness of her complexion is offset by the red of the pillowcase upon which her hair is spread like a diabolic halo
a dark garbo sultry and remote shes a ruined beauty
morticia opens her eyes
adoringly unhappy darling
passionately oh yes yes
pugsley crouches on the floor playing with his kid sized chemistry set
the walls of his room are covered with road signs hes collected bridge out
sawed off stop signs still on their poles are stacked in the corner
in another corner stands a cylindrical floor to ceiling this tubby energetic monster of a nine year old boy has every chance of growing up to be the public monster
his parents would be proud of
he mixes chemicals in a beaker
the brew steams
grin ning wickedly pugsley swallows it down
he contorts undergoing the beginnings of a transforma tion then shrinks to the size of a mouse
laughing he crawls out of his human size pajamas
solemn and mournful ten year old wednesday has black hair and white skin like her mother
she sits on a stool among the stored addams family objects one end of a the trap door is flung open granny pokes her head through
shes a giggly hag who looks like she was in the bathtub when the hairdryer fell in
wednesdays pulled tooth swings at the end of the string
thank you grandmama
in a foul mood granny tromps up into the attic
you kids are going to have to kill your own breakfast this morning
wednesday opens a cigar box
inside the box are assorted human and animal teeth fangs and dentures along with a collection of glass eyes
wednesday drops her tooth in the box
gomez takes morticia in his arms
as she languidly drapes herself across his chest she is caught in a sudden shaft of sunlight
on the bedside table beside her morticias oversized carnivorous gomez
il me perce comme un poignard
wildly aroused tish
he kisses his way up to her neck then suddenly bursting with enthusiasm and a sense of purpose leaps from the bed drawing his bedside saber from its sheath and
brandishing it at the offending beam
en garde monsieur sole
he thrusts and parries pantomiming a duel with the shaft of light
last night you were
you were like some desperate howling demon
you frightened me
do it again
gomez instantly aflame
granny delivers a swift kick to her fog machine
lousy bucket of bolts
the fog machine straight out of a jules verne nightmare is malfunctioning this morning struggling to churn out its patches of fog
at the window gomez pokes his head out
in the background morticia brushes her hair with a silver filigree brush
disturbed granny wheres your fog
the fog machine hurtles downwards missing decapitating gomez by millimeters
it crashes below smashing through the front porch roof
standing beside the front door is lurch the gigantic family butler a reanimated stitched together behemoth
he holds two brown paper lunch bags in his enormous hands
the bags contents wriggle eager to escape
taking her bag thank you lurch
pugsley takes his bag opens it and peers inside
lurch growls and pugsley closes the bag
gomez is hitting golf balls thing serving as his tee while morticia sips tea
flies with incredible speed through the window of the addams only neighbor
this well tended home sits on the hill overlooking the addams mansion like some republican sentinel
judge womack the addams crusty patrician neighbor is having his breakfast when gomezs golf ball lands in his cornflakes shattering the bowl covering him with milk
judge womack hurries to his broken window shaking his fist damn you addams
it appears to gomez and morticia that judge womack is waving to them
gomez waves back
calls sorry about the window judge
keep the ball
i have a whole bucketful
he holds up a bucket of golf balls
he tosses his golfclub to thing who deposits it in the golfbag
gomez joins morticia watching the little ones off to school
they grow up so fast dont they
tires smoking the school bus strains to chug down the road
gleefully hanging from the rear bumper is pugsley dragging his heels
morticia wearing gardening gloves is snipping the blossoms off her roses
gomez sits at a table playing chess with thing
its a milestone tish
this very evening our twenty fifth seance
all those years gnawed by guilt undone by woe burning with uncertainty
yearningly oh gomez dont torture yourself
thats my job
imagine darling if fester did come back
half alive barely human a rotting shell
tully alford the family attorney and his wife margaret approach gate a wrought iron monstrosity that opens of its own accord
though tully comes here often and margaret has been here before they never cease to be startled by gate
tully has a puffy once handsome face and an embittered grey aura that is the mark of a middle age misspent
high strung and superficial margaret is more disap pointed in tully than he is in himself
margaret passes through gate first
then as tully passes through gate slams on him clipping him and catching the end of his coat
tully fights gate for his coat
let me go
ignoring tully margaret continues stiffly up the walk
to gate gimme that
im warning you
its not a good day
gomez moves a chess piece
thing gestures out the window
gomez and morticia both look out
as they do thing moves two chess pieces cheating
looking out tully is here darling
please gordon by all means go
coming to his senses mother im
im so terribly sorry
he kneels at her side it was just a party
it means nothing
those siamese twins that hunchback cousin it theyre not you
clutching him savagely say it gordon
make me believe it
i love you
and i want money
very no nonsense weve got to find tully
morticia is looking for her children
she discovers pugsley asleep curled up on the silver platter where the two headed pig lay
she finds this enchanting
morticia shushes him she points to the platter
whispering look our little boy
whispering all tuckered out
whispering so sweet
he looks just
like a little entree
pugsley wakes up he looks around
wheres the party
its over darling have you seen your sister
not since before the mamushka
dont fret well find her
gomez rallies the family for the search
morticia wears a black cloak
granny has grabbed her divining rod
lurch distributes torches then stands aside awaiting instructions
pugsley helps gomez unroll an ancient map of the area
pugsley head for the dung heap
mama and morticia the shallow graves
ill take the abyss and lurch check the bottomless pit
worried her favorite
calls out fester
they look up at fester looking down at them from wednesdays window
you take the ravine
and the unmarked abandoned well
somebody should stay behind in case she comes back
then wholl take the swamp
thing tugs at the cuff of gomezs pants
thats the spirit thing lend a hand
they all sweep off with gomez in the lead
fester is still at the window
abigail joins him
spread far and wide over the grounds the various members of the family search for wednesday tiny lights aloft calling
where the hell is tully
they head out
fester and virginia find
sitting in an armchair basking in the rays of sunshine that beam from a copy of the sun also rises
tully smiles at them
what are you doing
taking a little sun
have you gone mad
tully closes the book and smugly unfurls a legal document
thing hops lily pads stopping occasionally to quest the air for his mistress
torch aloft pugsley searches through the primeval forest
lurch picks up a car looking for wednesday
morticia and granny stand in the middle of the dripping dankness
grannys torch casts scary shadows on the cave walls
calling out wednesday
oh mama i was sure wed find her here
gomez reaches a stately mausoleum at the far end of the cemetery
two proud marble vultures guard the entryway
gomez lowers the uplifted claw of one of the vultures and the stone doors slide open
he steps into inside it is catacomb like filled with the bleached bones of the addams dead
gomezs torch casts shadows one of which belongs to wednesday curled asleep on a stone sarcophagus
relieved to find her gomez approaches quietly
he doesnt want to wake her up
he lifts her tenderly in his arms
gate cant open
he rattles miserably on his hinges locked tight with heavy chains and yellow police tape large no trespassing
addams family keep out
signs are posted on gates rusty bars
the family appalled at the sight of gate
lurch carries the sleeping wednesday and pugsley
whats all this
hurries down the walkway waving his legal document
this is a restraining order gomez
a restraining order
it requires you to keep a distance of one thousand yards from this house
youve got about nine hundred and ninety nine yards to go catch my drift
in disbelief i am restrained from my own house
not your house moustache
not any more
it belongs to the eldest living descendant the older of the brothers fester addams
but this is lunacy
fester adores gomez
hes afraid of him
seeing the twins brought it all back
to gomez youre bitter rivals gomez always were always will be
its not so
those girls meant nothing he knows that
i demand to see fester
sorry no can do
hes very hurt its not a good time
leave it alone
or better yet just leave
wednesday comes forward rubbing the sleep from her eyes
but he isnt even uncle fester
gomez and morticia turn to look at her
to his family do not fear justic shall prevail
the courts will decide
fervently they say a man who represents himself has a fool for a client
well with god as my witness i am that fool
hammers on the judges bench
pull back to reveal is the presiding judge
he hammers the bench again then reads his decision
given applicable standards of proof the attempts to impugn this mans character or question his identity have been woefully inadequate
it is with no small amount of personal satisfaction that i declare fester addams legal executor of the addams estate and rightful owner of all properties and possessions contained herein
he holds up a golf ball i believe this is yours
the family members troop to the car with their few possessions
already sits in the passenger seat of the duesenberg his coat draped over his shoulders as if he were an invalid his head thrown back
morticia carries out cleo her carnivorous plant
granny carries her favorite cauldron wednesday one of her marie antoinette dolls pugsley his chemistry set
lurch uproots his favorite tree and joins the procession
thing follows dragging a toy wagon packed with his rings his glove
the duesenberg eases out of the driveway and onto the street weighed down by lurchs tree sticking out of the trunk
standing at a second story window watches the car drive off
a two story neon arrow points the way to this bungalow court bright and awful ersatz western
log cabins of simulated wood surround the teepee shaped office
the addams duesenberg is parked in front of the furthest cabin
the asphalt has been ripped up in big chunks and lurchs tree is parked next to the addams new home
morticia leans into frame
with an icepick and a hammer she deftly makes a large spidery crack in the round mirror
sighing deeply she stands back to admire her handiwork
granny joins her
i like it
her mother pats her consolingly
just as long as were together nest pas mon cher
as she turns to gomez we see the interior of the bungalow all ersatz cowboy and indian mixed with chrome plated plastic and orange shag carpet
sits slumped in a chair made from wagon wheel and nauga hyde
its as if all of his insane vibrant energy has been leeched from him
hes a broken man
he looks back at her as if hes never heard french
wednesday tends to him
she and her mother exchange a worried look
comes from the bathroom nibbling a wrapped bar of motel soap
this place isnt so bad
they even put candy in the bathroom
thats the soap dear
he takes another greedy bite
wednesday pats her fathers arm
do you want a cigar father
in a monotone theyre very bad for you
very worried father
wednesday exchanges a panic stricken look with morticia
the family moves closer to gomez
but maybe ill have one of those
he takes a bar of soap from pugsley
gomez unwraps it and morosely eats
on three hands as they reach up to pull three of the countless chains
drops open dumping out fester abigail and tully all of them wet and bedraggled and gasping for air
to fester youre doing this on purpose
they all struggle to their feet and march grimly back toward the door
gomez is stretched out on the naked box springs of his bed the mattress pushed aside
a damp cloth covers his eyes
thing massages his aching head
a bowl of motel soaps is beside him
in contrast morticia squarely faces the crisis
she addresses the family from the head of the breakfast table the want ads open on the table before her
we are addamses and we will not submit
who recalls the fable of the tortoise and the hare
the swift yet lazy little cottontail and his slow but determined companion
what does that story teach us as addamses
kill the hare
put the tortoise on the highway
during rush hour
we will survive
poison us strangle us break our bones we will come back for more
because we like it
because were addamses
gomez tries to rouse himself
out of it were addamses
he burps soap bubbles floating from his mouth
wednesday and pugsley have set up a lemonade stand their contribution to the addams financial well being
an array of poisons are lined up on their rickety table
theyve slashed their prices to a nickel per cup
the pitcher on the table before them steams
cars speed by
carrying a sample vacuum cleaner and a bucket lurch comes out of the motel courtyard
pugsley offers him a cup of punch
on the house
lurch downs it in a gulp and heads off
feeling the effects of the lemonade lurch burps a tongue of flame shoots from his mouth and incinerates a wooden indian advertising the wampum court
morticia is being interviewed by a personnel officer a relentlessly perky gal with a clipboard
we have so many homemakers re entering the work force your domestic skills can be very valuable
spells and hexes
knowingly liberal arts
have you been a volunteer pta service organizations
well one day each week i visit death row at our local prison with my children
perplexed with your children
well what about your husband
is he currently employed
hes going through a bad patch at the moment
but its not his fault
with some bitterness of course not
what is he a loafer
a hopeless layabout
a shiftless dreamer
wistfully not anymore
the personnel officer shoots morticia a doubtful glance and begins rifling through her card file
abigail and fester are seated at opposite ends of the couch
fester stares off into space
abigail is going through a stack of colorful travel brochures
the mediterranean the riviera once we find the money well go everywhere
well try again right after lunch
gordon where should we go first
sadly i dont know
she snaps her fingers in the air castanet style trying to be festive ariba
wednesday and pugsley are at their lemonade stand
they are negotiating with a prissy little girl in a girl scout uniform
the girl scout carries several boxes of girl scout cookies
with grave doubts is this made from real lemons
i only like all natural foods and beverages
organically grown with no preservatives
are you sure theyre real lemons
i tell you what
ill buy a cup if you buy a box of my delicious girl scout cookies
do we have a deal
are they made from real girl scouts
geraniums in the flower boxes
surrounded by a white picket fence
carrying his sample vacuum cleaner and bucket the tools of his new trade lurch carefully opens the little white gate
he rings the doorbell afraid he might break something
a blonde housewife in tennis whites obviously in a hurry opens the door only to be greeted by a bucketful of slop thrown past her onto her peach oriental rug
she screams in horror turns to challenge the perpetrator of this atrocity and seeing lurch screams again
in a panic she tries to slam the door on lurch but like the salesmans manual undoubtedly advised he sticks his foot in the way
the door partially rips off its hinges
lurch steps inside and shuts the door as best he can
a moment passes
the door swings open and lurch exits jauntily waving a check
morticia is telling a story to a group of toddlers who have gathered in a circle around her sitting on carpet squares
the room is sunny and cheerful with crayon drawings taped to the walls
and so the witch lured hansel and gretel into the candy house by promising them more sweets
and she told them to look in the oven and she was about to push them in when low and behold hansel pushed the poor defenseless witch into the oven
where she was burned alive writhing in agony
now boys and girls what do you think that feels like
after a beat all the toddlers begin to cry and wail
thru thru thru thru granny holds a club behind her back as she stalks something
here kitty kitty kitty
eating compulsively form a box of mallomars gomez is still stretched out on the naked box springs
he stares vacantly at a game show on tv
jeopardy is on
reading from the card monsters of history for
he was known as the butcher of bavaria
shouts grandfather addams
smacks his forehead hard damn
not in the form of a question
granny running now club raised hurries past the open window of the bungalow
she stops at the sight of gomez inside standing on the bed staring at the television
on the tv set gomez is now watching geraldo rivera hosting his tabloid style show
voodoo zombies the stuff of legend or a living nightmare
do zombies really exist
how are they made
where can we find them
call in with your comments
a call in number is flashed on the screen
gomez reaches for the phone
abigail and gordon are seated at opposite ends of the table having lunch
it is very quiet
after lunch well try again
very flat yes mother
well find the money
and meanwhile we have this little nest
quiet and cozy
without that dreadful family
just the two of us away from the world
our dream come true
as fester repeats yes mother in his drone abigail mimics him silently
on the tv screen
geraldo is talking to a woman in the studio audience
so your son was brainwashed by voodoo slave masters and forced to recruit others
lets take a call
on the studio pa system geraldo
cutting him off mr
addams please stop calling
we dont know where they meet
pull back to the motel room
gomez lets the phone drop
morticia seated on the edge of the box spring tries to comfort him
pugsley wednesday and lurch are seated nearby very worried about gomez as at a death watch
gomez is now surrounded by junk food and a mountain of junk food wrappers bags and styrofoam containers
ritually as handmaidens morticia brings gomez the remote control for the tv and wednesday brings him a copy of tv guide
pugsley brings gomez a bag of doritos and lurch brings him a canister of pringles
gomez uses the remote to switch channels
an episode of the cosby show comes on
he switches off the set and stares at the blank screen
i dont understand
all he does is watch tv and eat
i know gomez lets go for a drive
the whole family
not even turning a drive
and miss matlock
granny opens the door and sticks her head in
dinners going to be late
she slams the door
we hear her whistling
morticia is putting wednesday to bed
if that man isnt uncle fester then who is he mother
i dont know darling
i wish i did
why is that lady doing all this
its hard to say
sometimes people have had terrible childhoods
and sometimes they just havent found their special place in life
and sometimes theyre dogs from hell and must be destroyed
morticia kisses wednesday and she closes her eyes to go to sleep
the family sleeps all but morticia
she sits up in bed beside gomez
she looks around at her family
wednesday sleeps in the same bed as granny
lurch is flat out on the floor
pugsley uses him for a mattress and thing uses pugsley
pugsley snores the inhale part of a snore lurch groans the exhale part and thing punctuates by wiggling
morticia stares down at gomez for a long beat
she strokes his hair lovingly
full of resolve she gets out of bed
fester is lying in bed the covers around his chin
abigail sits on the bed beside him tucking him in
i know why youve been so glum
its because its taking us a little longer than wed hoped to find the gold
isnt that right
fester turns away depressed
of course it is
well dont you worry were right on the verge
tomorrow for certain my darling
she kisses him on the forehead and stands
she goes to the door and turns you know some people might think its strange for a mother and son to be so close
i think its beautiful
dont you gordon
fester mumbles something under his breath
very stern what
dutifully yes mother
instantly very sweet dabbing her eye with a fingertip look im weeping
the minute the door shuts fester gets out of bed
he is fully clothed
he goes to the window and begins to climb out
morticia fully dressed wearing her cloak heads off down the walk
unseen by her thing trails after
morticia just outside gate struggles to get it open thing clutching the bars also attempting to block her way
stop it you two
morticia breaks free of thing
tully opens the front door
he smiles maliciously at the sight of morticia on the stoop
i would like to speak with fester
tully steps aside
weve been expecting you
morticia crosses the threshold
thing does his damnedest to flag down any of the few oncoming cars
he waves to no avail dances around in frustration then tries hitchhiking sticking out his thumb
a passing car splashes him with mud
screwing up his courage in a kamikaze leap he grabs ahold of the bumper of the next car that comes along and hangs on for dear life as the car
speeds down the street
morticia is now stretched out on the torture rack
fester and tully are securing her hands and feet under abigails supervision
fester seems torn agitated upset
to abigail graciously you are a desperate woman consumed by greed and infinite bitterness
a beat we could have been such friends
i dont think so
the vault mrs
addams any thoughts
sweetly to abigail despite everything i dont hate you
i pity you
persecution fiendish torture inhuman depravity sometimes its just not enough
gordon lets get started
im not stalling
stop badgering me
pushing fester aside tully take over
id love to you know that but ive got this stomach thing
when i torture people
its just me
shoving tully toward the rack do it
to morticia politely wheres your bathroom
tully shuts his eyes and tightens the rack
morticias bones make a horrible popping stretching sound
she moans rather sensually
tully tightens the rack again
more bone popping noises
morticia moans again even more orgasmically
tully tightens the rack a third time
bone popping noises
morticia moans very voluptuously
she opens her eyes
she sighs in afterglow
she glances at tully
to tully flirtatiously youve done this before
a hand possessed thing races up the driveway raising dust as he goes
thing leaps dramatically onto the porch then stops dead to knock on the cabin door
after a beat who is it
were paid through thursday
he opens the door
thing rushes in
thing skitters on the kitchen counter frantically signing
in the background the rest of the family sleeps
whispers slow down thing
its terrible when you stutter
frustrated thing grabs a spoon and begins tapping out morticia in danger
send help at once
thing flops down in exhausted triumph
gomez grabs him and heads off
morticia is now lashed to an enormous torture wheel
tully and abigail are tending the stick branding irons stuck in the roaring fire
to abigail you cant
not with red hot pokers
queasy is this gonna smell
graciously with understanding tully alford charlatan
how gomez adored you
well not enough
dear fester or whomever you are
which is the real you the loathsome under handed monster youve become
or the loathsome underhanded monster we came to love
desperately dont ask me
fester i saw you tonight at my window
i know it was you
very upset i was
i couldnt sleep
gordon i have a thought
just a notion top of my head
tell me what you think
since you and mrs
addams are so very close
abigail takes a red hot poker out of the fire and hands it to fester
be my guest
thru thru gomez cuts the engine
the car glides silently through gate who opens uncharacteristically without a creak
gomez stops the car and skulks out
thing skulks after him
gomez sees the reflections of the roaring fire through the study window
as fester takes the poker and approaches morticia gomez crashes through the window in a back flip
thing judo flips in after gomez
thing tosses gomez a saber off the study wall
tully also grabs a saber and approaches gomez from behind
darling take care
without even looking gomez parries tullys blow from behind
then he whirls on tully
dirty pool old man
this is for keeps gomez
not just doubloons
tully feints then slashes shredding the front of gomezs jacket
one for you tully and
gomez attacks his blade flashing like lightning
in a blur of action tullys sword is knocked from his hand and hes sent tumbling backwards finally landing on his knees
one for me
tully looks up at gomez with cowardly pleading eyes
im your lawyer
im on retainer
let him up
gomez turns to see
who now has a pistol aimed at morticia
one shot and morticia will die horribly
gomez throws aside his sword
tully scrambles to his feet
to gomez thats right
now get moving addams take him to the vault
and if youre not back in one hour
the pistol aimed at morticia and using her accent i displace her
gomez is near enough now to take morticias hand on the torture wheel
tish seeing you like this
my blood boils
as does mine
touching the torture wheel this wheel of pain
cu on fester confused at watching this emotional display
to morticia to live without you only that would be torture
to gomez a day alone only that would be death
gomez kisses morticias hand
knock it off
the vault addams right now
but mother cant we
gomez reaches for the book that will open the secret panel can it gordon
stop dragging your feet
you disgust me youre nothing but a useless snivelling baby
a stone around my neck
what was i thinking i shouldve left you where i found you
at abigails final words fester suddenly leaps forward
no tricks gomez
thats the wrong book
gomezs hand is on the right book greed but fester stops him from pulling it
gomez looks into festers eyes realizing what hes about to do
murmuring good show old man
fester reaches for a different book hurricane irene nightmare from above
seeing the title of the book tully suddenly panics put that book down gordon
you dont know what it can do
its not just literture
advancing on tully oh really
im your friend gordon think of the doubloons
theyre not yours tully
angle on gomez releasing morticia from the torture wheel
quickly my darling
he helps her down from the wheel
leather straps red hot pokers
later my dearest
angle on fester facing off with abigail as tully cowers
keep the book closed gordon listen to mother
ill never listen to you not ever again
i had to be strict with you because i cared
put it down
you never really loved me
angle on gomez and morticia nearing the bookcase
come my love to safety
but what of fester
calling out to fester old man this way
angle on abigail and fester
stop whining you little good for nothing
be a man
youre a terrible mother
there i said it
fester opens the book and blasts tully out of the window
then he blasts abigail out as well
angle on gomez who has now pulled the right book greed to open the bookshelf
amid the storm he is leading morticia behind the bookshelf
he tries to hold the bookshelf open for fester to follow fighting the gale force winds
calling out to fester old man
angle on thing across the room struggling across the floor toward the bookshelf
thing fights the wind which pelts him with papers and other flying debris
gomez can no longer fight the storm and the bookshelf slams shut
fester desperately tries to close the book to quell the storm but a huge bolt of lightning zaps him
he falls to the floor with electricity coursing through him
move in on the storm raging within the pages of the book then thru thru thru thru a group of little children approach the front door
there is a hand lettered sign on the door reading halloween open house
the children are dressed in traditional halloween costumes theres a witch a ghost a skeleton etc
and they all carry trick or treat bags
they giggle and chatter
one of the children is pushed forward and he knocks on the front door
as the door opens the children chant trick or
they freeze in mid chant
we do not see who has opened the door but the children do
after a beat they scream in horror and run terrified back toward the street
lurch is closing the front door looking puzzled
the family is busily decorating the house for their annual halloween festivities
all the decorations are elegant yet ancient dusty and faded
the crystal gloves in the chandeliers have been replaced by miniature jack o lanterns
skeletons each wearing a top hat hang from the sconces by the nooses around their necks
there are clusters of black and orange balloons covered with cobwebs
uncle fester and thing are draping the banisters and stairway railings with a garland made from crepe paper dead branches and spanish moss
skulls each holding a candle are scattered about on the stairs and the furniture
a stuffed life size scarecrow leans against the stairway with a pitchfork through its throat
a banner on the wall reads happy halloween and the letters drip with blood
gomez hangs upside down from the balcony
morticia hands him a decoration
granny appears from the kitchen carrying a tray of food
well its their loss
i even made finger sandwiches
perched on festers shoulder thing shakes in fear
petting thing oh calm down
here we come
wednesday and pugsley come down the stairs
wednesday is dressed in her usual style but pugsley is dressed as a tiny version of uncle fester complete with bald head and greatcoat
the adults are delighted

children begging in the streets
im so glad i can share this night with my family my real family
now that ive got my memory back
that unfortunate woman
filled with evil
shaking her head sadly but not enough
to fester she wasnt your mother
she just said that
ooot oot gleep
to it you remember old sport she really did find him tangled in a tuna net twenty five years ago
from the bermuda triangle
ooot oot oot
stranger things have happened
im sorry and im not bitter but i blame tully
ooot blipper gleep
the coquette oh stop
to fester thank god for that lightning
knocked some sense into you
please uncle fester
for the picture
fester pops a light bulb into his mouth
gomez stands up having finished the pumpkin
he places it on a table and lights the candle inside
the pumpkin glows
it has one eye in the middle of its forehead
everyone oohs and ahhs
you know all the old sayings are true
theres no place like home
and blood is thicker than water
and just as refreshing
all right everybody time for a game
what shall it be bobbing for apples
ooot glibber glip
of course wake the dead
delighted to gomez remembering this childhood favorite wake the dead
equally excited wake the dead
out to the cemetery
come on everyone
everyone starts to exit chattering happily
to granny ive never played this before how does it go
did you bring a shovel
uncle fester will you be on my team
to wednesday i tell you what well give you a head start
three skulls and a pelvis hows that
pugsley and wednesday cheer and run out
fester faces gomez
my own dear brother who could be more precious
blood is thicker than water old man
touched by the brothers devotion and just as refreshing
gomez offers his hand
fester takes it in a manly handshake
let us never be parted
let us always be as one
fester flips gomez in a judo flip
gomez lands at the foot of a glass display case
the camera pans up the case
it contains abigail and tully expertly fester rises dusting himself off
joyfully to gomez and morticia come on
well catch up
fester runs out
everyone is gone
morticia and gomez have drifted into the front hall they are moving toward the front door
deeply satisfied our family
what are they
oh tish what a night
everyone together at last
what more could we ask
morticia holds up the garment shes been knitting its a baby jumper with three legs
ecstatic cara mia
is it true
shaking her head yes oui mon cher
they embrace as the front door swings open of its own accord
morticia and gomez are silhouetted in the doorway
there is a full moon
in the distance a wolf howls
wispy ghosts flit through the night sky
a human scream is heard followed by grannys cackle
in the cemetery torches are seen like fireflies
