a neat well appointed flat tastefully decorated
framed against a large window which looks out over the city an elegant woman in her s evelyn greenslade
shes on the phone on hold
on the desk in front of her is a brand new laptop computer the screen reads getting started
thank you for your patience
your call is important to us
we will be with you shortly
evelyns patience is strained nonetheless
she taps her fingers on the desk
automated voice contd thank you for your patience
your call is a slightly accented voice finally interrupts
mrs greenslade thank you for yes now if you could stay on the phone for a moment and talk to me just talk to me

giles a judge in full wig and robes moves quickly down a corridor
he passes other judges going the opposite way
he arrives at the office of graham dashwood goes in
graham is at his desk
his robes are on a hanger his wig is on a stand beside him
graham and giles walk down the corridor
bloody retirement parties
hard cheese soft wine and endless speeches
why do people do that
no one ever said about any kind of party it was a wonderful occasion just a shame that the speeches were so short
itll be you one day
one day very soon
youve been saying that for years
they walk into a large room full of lawyers
at one end of the hall a very old judge is giving a very dull speech
an occasion such as this leads one to cast ones mind back to the days when i first entered my pupillage
i had the very good fortune of serving as a junior to mr justice stancombe grahams not listening any more
hes looking around the room
at the old tired faces
the unwelcome news that i would transfer chambers bringing to mind the old adage a fronte praecipitium a tergo upi everything seems to slow down the judges mouth moving more
and more sluggishly though his voice remains the same
the effect is strange
then the sound of laughter
this is the day
everyone looks round at him
hes almost as surprised as they are that hes spoken out loud
this is the day
he turns and walks out
staff bustle around a busy a e ward
muriel lies on a bed in the corridor
the head nurse karen rushes past
listen young lady
i want a cup of tea and i want it now
the trolley will be along shortly
how hard dyou have to fall down before you get some proper attention
hours ive been lying here and not a single doctor has come to see me
now thats not quite true is it mrs donnelly
a doctor did try and examine you and you sent him away
she looks up to the far end of the ward where a doctor is washing his hands
he can wash all he likes that colours not coming out
i want an english doctor
an english doctor
why didnt you say so
ill get one right away
she goes away comes back moments later with a tall handsome doctor
the bad news for muriel is this is dr ghujarapartidar
and this is mrs donnelly
a crescent of identical bungalows part of a brand new retirement facility
a mobility scooter carrying an elderly resident trundles down the road
with an unlimited range of leisure opportunities just a stones throw away
a young estate agent evan is showing douglas and jean around a very small and very beige bungalow
so as i say what youre looking at here is very competitively priced you cant get better value for your grey pound
another little feature not necessary right now but give it a couple of years rails on the walls to help you get around and down here a panic button in
case of a sudden fall brings the warden running
what if we fell somewhere else
its just that we might not manage to plan our sudden fall in the exact corner where the button is
as i say
and would it be possible to get the rail to go through the middle of the room as well
to help us get across not just around
could we have a moment please
thanks so much
thirty years in the civil service and this is all we can afford
would it help if i apologized again
but try it anyway
judith ish is sitting opposite someone
we dont see whom
and then after that i worked as a systems analyst for a few years but i just found it so dull what i really wanted was to do something that
was more creative that matched my
on the form they asked for our age bracket and the age we wanted to meet
and in both cases i ticked
now we see the man shes talking to
hes dapper nice looking
and at least
thats right yes
so did i
theyre at a speed dating evening
numbered tables etc
anyway dont stop
how old are you
dyou mean you were born in the early s
judy i know what youre asking its judith
and trust me ive still got it
the bell goes the signal for the women to get up and move along to the next table
judith leaves without looking back
i just cant find anyone that wants it
another hopeful candidate arrives opposite norman
and looks crestfallen at whats on offer
madge is in her bedroom
shes arguing with her son in law craig
madges suitcases are by the door
this is crazy
you cant just up and leave like this
and yet if you watch me thats exactly what youll see happen
she picks up her suitcases heads out of the room
madges daughter jessica is on the landing
whats going on
your mothers lost it
my mother never had it
talk to her
she doesnt listen to me
nobody listens to you
she heads down the stairs
craig and jessica follow
its one of the great mysteries of life that someone so vibrant and fascinating as my daughter should choose to spend her life with this fraction of a man
i still dont understand whats going on
i just asked her to babysit
and now she says shes leaving
theyre at the bottom of the stairs
jessicas children liam and katie are watching
but you love babysitting
i loved it last night
we had pizza and stayed up late
and the night before
we had chinese and stayed up late
if you dont go tonight we could do a curry
its tempting my darlings but you know why i must leave
to her parents being here is stopping her finding a husband
dont let the buggers get you down
madge turns to go
how many husbands have you had anyway
she turns back smiles
including my own
then shes out of the front door and heading for the taxi
madge climbs into the back of the cab
name the place darling
where are you going
i have absolutely no idea
evelyn whom we saw earlier on the phone is in the living room
her son christopher is there
and her lawyer theres no other way there just isnt
harold told us this three months ago
and im afraid matters have only got worse
we cant wait any longer
we need to put this flat on the market and at least make a start at paying off dads debts
christopher turns to harold
ive talked it through with polly and the boys and of course we all agreed
ma will move in with us
i think thats best evelyn
its what hugh wouldve wanted
they wait for confirmation from evelyn
end of discussion
thats what your father used to say
when thered never really been any discussion at all
i want to look after things for you
like he did for forty years yes
and look how that turned out
she turns to harold how can any of us know what hugh wouldve wanted
and would he have seen fit to tell us anyway
obviously the flat has to be sold
best then to christopher and youre very kind
and dear polly
but no i wont be coming to live with you
muriel has now been transferred to a ward
she is listening to dr ghujarapartidar
you need a new hip mrs donnelly
its not a difficult operation
easy for you to say youre not having it
you do need a new hip
im not getting it from you
nd green revisions i
not me personally no
not any of your lot
so when do i have the operation
im afraid youll be on a waiting list for at least six months
at my age i cant plan that far ahead
i dont even buy green bananas
there is another way
our hospital trust is funding a new pilot scheme that will enable us to out source you to another hospital where they can perform the procedure almost immediately and at
a fraction of the cost
is it local
that depends how you define local
evelyn is on the phone to her son christopher
theyre both sitting at computers
evelyns new found dexterity is impressive
around evelyns room are packing boxes some already full
when did you get a computer
how far along is the progress bar
the strip at the bottom that tells you i know what it is
what are you showing me anyway
the webpage has come up
its a picture of a beautiful old building
and underneath is written the best exotic as christopher gapes in horror he hears a mellifluous indian voice
come and spend your autumn years in an indian palace with the sophistication of an english country manor
steeped in the tradition of the raj tucked away on the outskirts of jaipur
the mellifluous tones continue
madge mouths the words to herself as she scans the same web page
it exudes historical ambience and is graced with breathtaking surroundings
jean whom we earlier saw looking at the bungalow is at the hairdressers
her stylist abi listens to her reading a computer printout for the same hotel
which looks classy elegant and welcoming
madges voice bleeds into jeans
lofty terraces open courtyards domes arches and canopied balconies transport one back in time
i wouldnt mind going there myself
in the background a train rumbles along the piccadilly line towards heathrow
douglas jeans husband is on the green with his friend simon
douglas is lining up a tricky putt
there wont be any golf courses
just as well
i cant afford the green fees
but a retirement home
douglas misses his putt
its a luxury development where all the residents are in their golden years
like the costa brava
but with more elephants
simon holes out
graham the judge is in his office
its nearly empty his entire life is being packed away
his friend giles watches him put more things in boxes
how long have we known each other
and youve never once talked about india
dyou want these books
you might need them again
graham smiles at him calls out
his cleaner mrs megson comes in
graham takes a beautiful vase off the shelf gives it to her
i want you to have this
are you sure
theres a slight crack on the bottom
but i think you might know something about that already
mrs megson goes
i used to live there
a long time ago
slightly down at heel and sparsely furnished
norman whom we met speed dating is talking to someone
we dont see who
quietly in the background radio music from an old battery radio
i have to go
and i could say i wish youd come but ive never lied to you
we both know i need more than you can offer
we know that
we see whos sitting in front of him
an ancient dachshund
to the dog dont make that face at me
normans polish landlady mrs jellinek is at the door
to her dog you
the dog hops off the chair and leaves
norman watches him go
mrs jellinek contd any warm clothes you have use for no more i take them
and not forget to leave keys when you go
norman is left alone
ill miss you too
the district ambulance driver jackson is pushing muriel in a wheelchair across a housing estate
you know wholl be there dont you
loads of them a sea of brown faces and black hearts all greasy haired and reeking of spices
never see one on their own do you
no becuase they hunt in packs
all the better to rob me blind and you know what
you can take it from here
youre supposed to see me into my flat
thats what they said
my wife is from mumbai
he heads off
muriel shouts after him
no good moaning to me mate
you married her
but hes gone
muriel wheels herself on over the bumpy ground
a reluctant christopher is pushing a trolley carrying evelyns cases to the terminal
youre sure your tickets are in order
they should be
the hotel paid for them
im sure theyd rather have us there than not
and its fantastically cheap for the first three months
i wonder why
they walk on in silence
how will we know youre alright
they do have phones there you know
or you can just read my blog
on the interweb
you can log in whenever you like read my news
i just hope the first item will be announcing your return
i dont suppose theyll be paying for the journey back
theyve reached the terminal
could you please before i go say one thing that is supportive
because ive never done anything like this before
without dad you never did anything at all
and i dont think youll be able to cope
i suppose well find out wont we
they head into the building
madge is at the first class check in desk
and the connecting flight to jaipur is first class too
the check in girl nods hands madge back her passport
i tell you its tough to get upgraded nowadays
i had to flirt so hard with the travel agent it was practically phone sex
the light is fading
norman appears to be relishing a detailed search from a female security guard
thorough as you like muriel is waiting to collect her bag from the belt
wed like to take a look in this bag madam if you dont mind
he lifts the bag onto a table
its heavier than he thought
security guard contd what you got in here anyway
he opens the bag stares in astonishment
ten jars of marmite
thirty one packets of chocolate hobnobs
no liquids on the plane
what does that mean
it means you cant take the pickled onions
or the pickled eggs
the pickles fine
the passengers from flight to delhi are seated at the gate waiting to board
muriel is wheeled up by an attendant and parked at the end of the only remaining row of empty chairs
douglas and jean are already sitting there
jean smiles politely as graham sits down a couple of seats away
norman arrives carrying his battery radio sees an empty place between jean and madge who is sitting at the end
he smiles knowingly at madge as he sits
finally evelyn takes the only available space between graham and douglas
and there the seven passengers wait patiently unaware of their common fate
the sound of a jet engine quiet at first finally engulfs them
the plane cruises down through a stunning sunset and lands at delhi airport
evelyn douglas jean and graham are descending on an escalator
madge is a few steps up
obviously ones read ones kipling but we view this as an opportunity to explore another culture as well as making new friends
and a retired judge is just the class of guest one was hoping for isnt it douglas
and is this your first time in india
you dont seem like an experienced traveller
although one has read ones guidebooks
evelyn and graham share a smile
douglas hides his
and madge sees it all
as they head towards the baggage carousel theyre met by muriel and norman emerging from the elevator
norman is pushing muriels wheelchair
play your cards right it could be
madge stares at him
a voice comes over the tannoy
ladies and gentlemen we regret to inform you that owing to bad weather flight to jaipur has been cancelled
the airline is happy to arrange
the airport is deserted except for the marigold hotel party who sit slumped and exhausted on another row of seats with muriels wheelchair at the other end
after a moment graham says alright
theyre all moving briskly through the hi tech ultra modern beautifully air conditioned building
of course its a good idea
who can you trust if not a high court judge
and this way we see more of the country
norman is pushing muriels wheelchair
leaning down to if anyone asks say youre my mother
i dont want people to think were together
in your dirty dreams
douglas these are not words that often pass my lips but you may actually be right
the country seems to be rather more civilised than one originally thought
our heroes are in the middle of an extraordinary scene
stifling heat deafening noise the chaos the bustle the grime the crowds the life
theyre surrounded by taxi drivers baggage handlers beggars etc
all clamouring for their attention
evelyn looks a little shocked
jean is traumatized a handkerchief to her face
graham at the ticket booth triumphantly holds up a fistful of tickets
shouting over the din the bus will drop us in the centre of town
we can take tuk tuks the rest of the way
they follow him through the hordes
and see their bus
its absolutely rammed
people are practically hanging out of the windows
theres not enough room
its time to prove the first and only rule of india theres always room
he starts to fight his way to the door
evelyns at the back
she stops for a moment looks around her
what larks pip
douglas is just ahead of her
he turns smiles
lets hope so
muriels wheelchair is strapped to the back of the bus which is screaming down the six lane highway
a huge tower of luggage is piled precariously on the roof
the road appears to be complete chaos cars buses even cows overtaking each other
the bus pulls into the outside lane to follow a truck which is overtaking some slower vehicles
as the truck pulls back into the inside lane it reveals a huge truck barrelling towards them on the wrong carriageway
norman sitting at the front screams his last scream
at the last minute the bus pulls back into the inside lane
the indians on the bus take absolutely no notice
norman is grinning from ear to ear
im loving this
evelyn is sitting next to madge
a few months ago i was organising the church flowers
are you struggling with the feeling youre not in control of your circumstances
you know what the shortest prayer in the world is
youre not doing the church flowers any more
may as well enjoy the ride
douglas is watching a nice indian family
theyre having a picnic
the father notices douglas looking offers him some food
douglas makes the namaste gesture takes some happily
are you insane
avoid all food not from a reputable vendor it will have been washed with impure water
douglas keeps eating with great enjoyment
its just a sandwich
then ill have the ham cheese and streptococcus please
or perhaps the bacteria lettuce and tomato
douglas turns to muriel
would you like some of this
i believe its aloo ka paratha
if i cant pronounce it im not eating it
the cacophony of horns continues
jean screams as another collision looms
the last of the light
the bus moves on through a beautiful landscape
everyone is asleep or trying to sleep
she reaches into her bag and carefully removes a biscuit
she surreptitiously lifts it to her mouth and starts to chew
madge has fallen asleep on evelyns shoulder
but evelyn is still awake as is graham
how long since you were here
as long as i was married
he died recently
dyou think were going to be alright
god dont ask me
im more scared than you are
they both smile sit in silence for a bit
i think its going to be extraordinary
the sun rises
a beautiful pearly dawn
the bus drives through the great gates of jaipur
below the city shimmers in the heat
its a magnificent sight
what exactly is a tuk tuk
our heroes are squashed into a pair of them facing forwards and backwards attempting not to swallow too much dust as they wheel crazily through the teeming morning streets of
they stare in amazement at the world racing past them
a scooter overtakes
a young man is driving his girlfriend riding side saddle on the back
her sari billows out behind her
douglas and evelyn both watch her struck by this image of beauty youth and vitality
the tuk tuks have pulled up and our travellers emerge exhausted and dirty staring through some garden gates at the marigold hotel
once a beautiful building once possibly even luxurious it is clearly in the process of being given at least half the face lift it badly needs
parts of the building are freshly painted some of the ornate balconies are crumbling and one wall is clad with crazily skewed bamboo scaffolding
a huge old tree towers over an untended garden its branches poking into the windows of the building
a young man leans out from an upper balcony to see the arrival below sonny kapoor early s
he deposits a paint pot and brush on a parapet and races off across the rooftop
dazed and horrified the travellers wander up the pathway
a cow standing in front of them is pushed into the garden by a couple of young houseboys who then run to the tuk tuks to collect their luggage
sonny clatters down the steep steps and comes tearing out onto a verandah as the travellers arrive in the courtyard below
he spreads his arms wide
welcome to india
they stare up at him
the courtyard is not without charm although somewhat delapidated
a fountain at the centre does not look as if it has seen water in years and faded awnings are strung up haphazardly
sonny is leading madge into the darkness of the building towards her room
this is a building of the utmost character which means that perhaps not everything will function in the way you expect it to
but as the manager and chief executive supervising officer of the marigold hotel i can tell you with great pride that the building has stood for centuries and will stand
for many more in shipshape condition
please follow me carefully avoiding that naughty stone there round this corner leading us most successfully all the way to your bedroom
the room is very small comfortable and tastefully decorated
but theres no door
my dear man
rooms have doors
what youre showing me here is an alcove
the door is coming soon most definitely
let us not concern ourselves with details mrs hardcastle
rather than speaking of doors we should instead take pleasure in the freedom to roam
does your room have a door
then thats where ill be staying
douglas and jean arrive at their room
douglas goes in through the arched doorway promptly comes back out again
bird in the room
bird in the room
jean pushes him aside goes on in
several pigeons are flying around in some panic
evelyn arrives at her room goes on in
the room is light and airy
and rather nice
but all the furniture is covered in sheets
as evelyn stands there sonny comes rushing in yanks all the sheets off and runs out again
muriel wheels herself towards her room
standing inside is a male nurse ajit
muriel swivels her chair around
graham is just going into his room
theres an indian in there
graham smiles goes on into his room
which is dusty but comfortable and pleasant
he looks around with satisfaction
norman is laboriously climbing the stairs to his room
he stops catches his breath
ajit is attempting to explain himself to muriel
to help with your recovery after the operation
youre not touching me
traditionally that is how physiotherapy is practised
norman comes out onto the roof of the hotel
his room is right in front of him a kind of penthouse cabin
a bed but not much else
the trees poke in through the open window
he walks through the room hangs his battery radio on a hook and leans out of the balcony surveying the view
jean is confronting sonny
i want to stay at the other hotel the one in the brochure
mrs ainslie prepare to be amazed
this is that very building
youve photoshopped it
i have offered a vision of the future
of course i had hoped that by now it would be the present
but in india we have a saying everything will be alright in the end
so if it is not alright then it is not yet the end
what will start to make this alright is for you to give us a refund
of course if that is what you desire you must have it
absolutely no problem i will refund you completely
without question mrs ainslie i most definitely will
straight away in three months
graham is taking some things out of his bag an old map of jaipur sepia tinted photographs of a british family during the raj official documents yellowing with age
he picks up a photograph looks at it
from outside we can hear ajit the physiotherapist a stay of five days and it is done under general anaesthesia
a hip replacement usually takes only two hours ajits explanation continues
muriel is trying not to panic
your surgeon will remove the top end of the thigh bone and insert an artificial bone instead
a most routine procedure
have you got a marker pen on you
i want to mark it
so you dont take the wrong hip
douglas is on his way down the stairs
evelyn comes out of her bedroom
is everything alright
i was just going to find the manager
im afraid hes dealing with my wife
or vice versa
i promised id call my son to tell him id arrived and and the phone in your room doesnt work
douglas picks up the very old style phone
evelyn is watching
now did you try jiggling it a bit
yes did that
did you kind of bang it lightly on the desk a few times
he twists off the mouthpiece of the receiver lifts the receiver carefully
and blows on it
how did you come to be here
i invested our well my retirement money in our daughters internet company
she assured me that as soon as the start up actually started up and the conversion from virtual to actual proved sufficiently viable then she would be able to pay
it all back
im not sure i understand what most of those words mean
it turns out neither did she
douglas has put the mouthpiece back on holds the receiver to his ear
there you are
good as new
no of course not
ive got no idea what im doing
evelyn bursts out laughing
now would you like me to not fix that chair
because i can do that too
the houseboys are struggling with the unequal task of pulling muriels wheelchair with muriel in it up the narrow steps
in honour of your arrival a special welcome british roast for you all
a group of mismatched table and chairs that constitute the dining area of the hotel
sonny is serving up a meal
his guests wearing garlands of marigolds listen politely
cooked lovingly by myself and my most loyalist factotum and helper young wasim
he points to young wasim
who is about and is sitting in the corner fast asleep
a wonderful taste of blighty
roast goat curry
so the upshot is that hes spent all our money getting us here and we cant leave till hes made some more
muriel has arrived at her table
gentle friends you have found your way to this place bequeathed to me by my beloved father that i have raised from the ruins of his broken dreams and renamed
the best exotic marigold hotel for the elderly and beautiful
yes i use the words most deliberately
norman is not looking very well at all
sonny doesnt notice keeps on going
you have all heard the chimes at midnight and long in tooth have youbecome
who knowshow many daysyou have left
but we are mosthonoured that youhave chosen tospend that time with us
normans head suddenly tips forward and he falls from his chair onto the floor
everybody crowds round but no one knows what to do
let me through please
my brother is a doctor
he kneels next to norman and checks his watch as he feels for a pulse
and then this man is dead
an appalled silence
please we must cover his face
we should preserve his dignity at this terrible moment
madge looks around
all there is is a napkin
she passes it sonny who lays it over the face of norman
who promptly coughs
he just coughed
i heard him cough
hes fainted thats all
sonny shakes his watch next to his ear
norman sits up
whats going on
did i nod off
everyone crowds round norman helps lift him back up
she just stares at them all
im in hell
the sun rises
a washer man bicycles up to the hotel a load of clean sheets balanced on his handlebars
shopkeepers on the street are beginning to set out their wares
old habits die easier than we think and new ones form
evelyn is typing hunt and peck at her computer
beside her the classified pages of the local newspaper
no longer do i reach out in the morning for radio
my news comes instead from the jaipur a sign reads the best exotic marigold hotel for the sonny affixes a sticker now with guests
soon i might even grow accustomed to the storm of car horns and vendors
the main road in jaipur is chaotically busy
crowds bikes cows dust noise and laughter
sonnys battered old car has broken down
madge is in the front seat douglas and jean in the back
sonny is aiming a couple of kicks at the engine
can there be anywhere else in the world that is such an assault on the senses
an office out of a kafka novel cloth bags containing files are piled all around the room floor to ceiling
graham is seated at a desk in front of a sober official
he is filling in a form
those who know the country of old just go about their business
but nothing can prepare the uninitiated for this riot of noise and colour
norman seems less interested in the astonishing geometric devices of the ancient observatory than in the female tourists who have come to see them
the chaos and din of the street is even more mind boggling
madge now has the bonnet up and is studying the engine
douglas stands in the street staring in wonderment around him
inside the car jean looks utterly traumatized shrinking lower in her seat as a horde of kids swarm at the windows shouting wheedling gesticulating
sonny does his best to wave them away
for the heat the motion the perpetual teeming crowds
sonny is conducting his own personal assault on our senses the guests look on with trepidation as another meal is laid before them
with the flow of exotic dishes he demands daily from the kitchen
mooli moong dal
paneer methi chaman
as the list unfolds the guests one by one enter their bathrooms a litany of doors closing until norman
contd mutton vindaloo
norman lies on his bed reading the kama sutra
he spins the book round in order to study an illustration more intently
the hospital puts the nhs to shame
its hi tech bright and spanking clean
sonny pushes muriel through the doors of the lobby
the reception area is a forest of dark skin
muriel is rigid with fear
initially youre overwhelmed
but gradually you realise its like a wave
resist and youll be knocked over
sonny is in discussion with some doctors
then he turns to see that muriel has vanished
through the window muriel can be seen frantically wheeling herself away down the path
contd dive into it and youll swim out the other side
madge is exchanging some coins with a street trader in return for a mobile phone
in her room madge scans a phone directory and dials a number
this is a new and different world
evelyn is finishing her blog
she picks up the paper checks something
the challenge is to cope with it
evelyn is coming down the path to the gate
and not just cope
evelyn is walking down a rough street on the outskirts of the city
kids are everywhere laughing shouting doing tricks begging
evelyn approaches them holding up a piece of paper
please can anyone direct me to this address
evelyns piece of paper gets passed around none of the kids can read
an older boy finally points
suddenly theres lots of pointing
she goes to move but the kids are still all around her
im sorry i dont
i dont really have much
she gives them the contents of her pockets
she starts to walk is surprised that the entire posse of kids walks with her
in fact the group seems to be growing exponentially
she looks like the pied piper
douglas is getting ready to go out
jean clearly isnt
graham was talking about this marvellous temple
i thought you might want to come with me
im your wife
have we met
youd really rather stay here all day
given the alternative yes
when i walk out in the morning the street kids all smile at me
because you give them money
one does this trick where he holds his hands out in front of himself and then swings through his own arms
got to be worth a rupee or two
ill go on my own then
the road is absolutely rammed with cars bikes and rickshaws
all honking horns all seemingly headed in different directions
evelyn has somehow made it to the central reservation
she takes a deep breath and plunges into the maze of traffic heading for the other side
graham is in a rickshaw
the rickshaw driver pravesh is driving it through a neighborhood in transition
skeletal structures of a new india rise above the houses
some kids playing cricket
the rickshaw weaves its way through them and comes to a halt
graham gets out and stands in the street dwarfed by a huge modern building some months away from completion
this cant be right surely
i am thinking so saab
but there were houses all along here
these were homes
i can take you some other place
thatll do for now
he hands over some money and pravesh pedals away
graham turns to look at the boys playing cricket
one of them sanjay is batting
there used to be all knocked down
and the people
graham nods turns to look at the giant structure that has taken over then turns back
dont grip so tightly with your right hand
sanjay looks puzzled
on the bat
the right is just a guide
keep your left elbow high play down the line of your arm and then youll hit through sanjay looks at him squinting in the sun
ajit is wheeling muriel through the hospital
when can i go back to england
as soon as you can walk onto the plane
how does the hip feel
they must have got lucky
i think the more operations they perform the luckier they get
he glances down at muriel who betrays no signof getting ajits joke
evelyn is still searching for the right address
shes turned off the main road and is heading down a narrow side streets
the city has become denser and the walls seem to have closed in
she pushes her way through the crowded market
uncertain evelyn turns down a narrow alley and suddenly finds herself in an enclosed courtyard strewn with makeshift washing lines
the atmosphere is faintly threatening
as she tries to find her way out she becomes aware that she is being watched the walls are full of doorways and people have come out to stare at
she has stumbled into their home
evelyn tries to suppress her panic turning from one face to another
im so sorry
i didnt realise she backs into a kind of flatbed trolley piled high with cooking utensils which clatter noisily to the ground
she goes to pick them up
oh im dreadfully sorry
a man is staring at her suresh
im sorry im just trying to get to this address
do you understand me
can you help me find this place
is that yes you understand or yes you can help me
some of the children who have gathered laugh at this and the tension is broken slightly
lets go with both shall we
sureshs flatbed trike is rolling down the street piled impossibly high with bundles of brightly coloured textiles
on the back enthroned in the fabric is evelyn
graham is playing cricket with the teenagers
hes good too
he whacks a ball off into the distance
a boy runs off to fetch the ball
graham half runs half walks to the other end then turns for a second run breathing heavily
then walks back to the crease gets ready for the next delivery
its hot and hes tired but he hasnt felt this good for years
give me the ball
i can take him
he turns cheerily to graham
down is where youre going uncle
do your worst
theyre both enjoying the banter as sanjay heads back to the beginning of his run up then turns and sprints in to bowl
as graham watches sanjay running towards him sanjay seems to slow his movements becoming sluggish never seeming to reach the crease
he looks at the faces of the other boys frozen waiting
the ball seems to take forever to leave sanjays hand
graham steps back completely fails to play a stroke and is bowled
thats what im talking about
i felt the need the need for graham still hasnt moved
are you alright uncle
graham finds his voice at last
yes im fine
suresh brakes stops outside a glass clad high rise building
suresh helps evelyn down off the back
this is it
then thank you
youre very kind
he rides off
evelyn looks nervously up at the building
a brightly lit open plan office on a high floor of the building
the city sprawls magnificently below
partitions divide off the cubicles
within them sit rows of workers all early s all with headsets clamped to their ears
as chaotic as the streets of jaipur are this place is immaculate controlled and efficient
we hear snatches of what theyre saying
thank you for talking to us today we do appreciate your call while i have you on the phone can i talk to you about our special offers
your call is important to us
now is there anything else i can help you with
shouldnt take more than five minutes
your custom is valuable to us im afraid ill have to refer that to my supervisor just a routine security check before we start
thank you for talking to us today through a glass partition evelyn can be seen sitting at a desk talking to someone
jay late s is talking to evelyn
youre sure i cant offer you something
we have english breakfast tea
building tea as you call it
its called builders tea
and no im fine
tell me then
how can i help you
i dont think you can
im sorry i shouldnt have come
i saw your advertisement in the local paper and it specifically mentioned the ability to talk to older people
but this is not what i imagined
you came for a job
ive wasted your time
everyone working here is a graduate of a good university
this is a place for ambitious people
i see that
it is really builders tea
we dunk biscuits into it
it means lowering a biscuit into your tea letting it soak in there then trying to calculate the exact moment just before it dissolves to whip it up to the
mouth and enjoy the blissful union of biscuit and tea combined
its more relaxing than it sounds
perhaps you can help us after all
a few minutes later
from the open plan office evelyn can be seen talking to jay
one person watching is sunaina s
shes talking on the phone
we do appreciate your custom which is very important to us
and can i draw your attention to our special but the person at the other end has hung up
sunaina starts to dial another number
then the clock hits and a buzzer sounds
sunaina gets up heads for the door
dozens of motorcycles are parked in front of the building
people are hanging around chatting and smoking
sonny arrives on his motorcycle a bag of marigolds strapped to the pillion seat
sunaina who is with some friends spots him comes over
she smiles as he pulls her to him
i get two breaks in eight hours
explain to me why i would want to waste one of them with you
he kisses her
she kisses him back
leave this place
come and work for me
you cant afford me
i cannot afford anything
i miss you
am i coming round tonight
lets meet somewhere else
i will rent a hotel room
sonny you own a hotel
it has many rooms
some of them now occupied
with actual real guests
why must you nitpick
it is not an attractive quality
they kiss again start to make out a bit
they turn to see jay who has come out of the call centre
calling to sonny you can let go of my sister now
dont call me that
jay smiles holds the door open for sunaina
jean is sitting in a chair reading
graham comes up the path
good evening your honour
i hope you had a good day
what did you get up to
well i started in my bedroom where i had a lovely couple of hours giving all the cockroaches names
then after a lunch that will long have a place in my heartburn i came out here and stared blindly at a book waiting for someone anyone to rescue me
and how glad i am it was you
why would you not go out
theres so much to see
jean had hoped for some appreciation of her wit and is floored by his question
she can hardly understand let alone tell him the depths of her discomfort
open your eyes mrs ainslie
all life is here i tell you
jean stares at him
he goes on through the archway into the hotel
i could talk to the chef if you like
perhaps get you some grilled chicken plain rice
i would appreciate that very much
graham goes on in
jean just sits there
wishing hed come back out again
muriel is back
shes in her chair on the terrace outside her room
a young hotel worker anokhi brings out a tray of food to her
muriel watches her but anokhi is deferential wont meet muriels eyes
she puts the tray down and leaves
muriel just sits there glaring balefully into the night the untouched tray of food by her side
evelyn comes into the dining area
graham is there at a table in the corner
evelyn sits at her table
i trust you had a good day
id rather hear about yours
i got a job
im going to be a sort of cultural advisor
a role im sure youll perform with great distinction
hes about to inquire further when evelyn sees douglas and jean emerge from their room
perhaps if you wouldnt mind keeping that news to yourself
im flattered you shared it with me
he turns to greet the new arrivals
good evening the ainslies
have you had a good day
i went to the temple you told me about
a place of meditation and peace quite stunning
so spiritual i bet you hardly noticed the smell of elephant dung
no elephants sadly
i thought i might see you there
where did you get to instead
yes where do you get to every day
well ive just finished telling mrs greenslade all about it
evelyn registers the lie but says nothing
im sure she wouldnt mind hearing it again
but graham is as elusive as he is tactful
i talked to the chef for you
he said it will be no problem
did you hear that douglas
plain grilled food manna from heaven
i dont have to have it too do i dont know how to thank you
you really should see this temple
id like that very much
but maybe take a clothes peg for your nose
graham and evelyn emerge through the arch heading for their rooms
graham starts down the stairs
goodnight to you
he seems about to say something else
she waits for a moment then walks on
can i show you something
evelyn is sitting in front of grahams collage
i grew up here
just a short drive away
it was a big house and we had servants everyone did
we knew their wives their children
one boy manoj became my friend
we played a lot of cricket together played anything we could
and thats how it stayed for years
until one night he became something more
we had a few months we had that
there was a weekend in udaipur we sat by a lake and watched the sun go down and i remember thinking
i will never be this happy again
and i was right
because quite suddenly it was over
wed fallen asleep and they found us
for me it was bad enough
but i already knew who i was and i think my family had guessed
for manoj the disgrace was absolute a double taboo
his father was fired they were sent away all of them
i dont know what i couldve done but it shouldve been more than nothing
i put up no fight
i let it happen
soon afterwards i went to england to university
i always told myself id come back
but i never did
and now i think
what if i am the last person on earth he wants to see
evelyn says nothing
i dont think i can go through with it
do you want to see him again
then you must
as the bell tolls the faithful arrive at the temple for morning prayers
evelyn stands outside her room listening to the bells sipping a cup of tea pensive
she looks down into a dilapidated part of the building where the staff are housed
women in bright saris go about their business
from her wheelchair muriel is re making her bed
she tucks in a perfect hospital corner
she looks up
anokhi is on the verandah replacing her untouched supper tray with breakfast
anokhi is about to leave but stops
then she goes to fetch muriels jar of pickle from the windowsill and places it on the table
muriel watches then wheels herself outside looks at the tray
from outside sonnys voicecan be heard
and so now that we are fully operational mr maruthi it is clear that with a small injection of funds for the phase two development
brimming with confidence sonny is walking a wealthy investor mr maruthi around the grounds
some builders are dismantling scaffolding
the best exotic marigold hotel can rise like a phoenix to its previous state of glory
and when i say small injection i mean small in the sense of medium sized
this hotel was never glorious
just the phoenix part then
how many rooms will there be
a great amount
plenty of rooms no question
theyve arrived in the courtyard
i am not a details man mr maruthi
nor was your father
they see muriel on her verandah
mr maruthi i present to you one of our beloved guests
dear mrs donnelly please describe in as much detail as you desire your experience of the ambience and atmosphere of the best exotic marigold hotel
kill me now
sonny steers mr maruthi towards the reception speaks quietly
the wheel is spinning
but the hamster is dead
he stops as he sees an elegant older woman standing in the doorway
this is the redoubtable mrs kapoor
what are you doing here
i couldnt have called
the phones dont work
thats why i came
sonny closes the door behind him
his mother starts going through the contents of his desk
who was that man out there
the contents of this desk are mine
dont open the drawers
i must insist you dont open the drawer
mrs kapoor opens the drawer
tell me why you have come
do i need a reason to visit my favourite son
he is in his mansion in delhi
my second favourite
he went to kerala to make his fortune
but make it he did
as i will make mine
i have a dream mummyji
a most brilliant one to out source old age
and not just for the british
there are many other countries where they dont like old people too
your brothers own a third of the hotel each they are entitled to a third of the profits
success does not happen overnight mummyji
this is blue sky thinking and it requires long term strategy and patience
how is your girlfriend
i look forward to you meeting her
and i look forward to you meeting the woman you will marry
she is from a good family in delhi
i can marry as i choose mummyji
i need no permission
i presume it is your girlfriend who teaches you such nonsense
one reason not to marry her
what if i love her
an even better reason
now send young wasim to the car for my luggage
he cannot carry he has a dicky back
wait your luggage
how long are you staying
as long as it takes
jean is looking out of her bathroom window down into the courtyard
she sees graham come out of his room
she turns back to the mirror looks at herself
near to muriel anokhi is sweeping the floor
you wont get the dirt out like that
anokhi just smiles at her radiantly
i worked in service for years looked after a lovely house
i kept it spotless
you need a bit more pressure on that brush
graham walks past on his way out
she wont speak english
shes what used to be called an untouchable
an outcast born below society
to a good hindu even her shadow is polluted
he greets anokhi in hindi and heads for the door
where dyou go every day
is it a woman
nip round there for a curry and a bit of afters
i dont think so
although nowadays more in theory than practice
a moment later jean comes rushing out
immediately she realises two things first that graham has already gone
and second that muriel is watching her
muriel says nothing
still nothing from muriel
she turns and goes back in
muriel thinks for a while then turns to anokhi
long old life isnt it
a classic colonial building straight out of the english raj
madge is being shown around by an elderly secretary mr the viceroy club was opened by the great lord kitchener himself and many of the fixtures have remained unchanged since
yes i see that
perhaps you could tell me a little about the clientele
wealthy widowed land owners
it is not the policy of this club to divulge details of our members
they go past a very handsome older indian man
who radiates wealth and privilege
mr dharuna contd good morning your excellency
where do i sign up
the admission fee is rupees and thereafter rupees each month
i wonder if i might get a little discount
owing to my status
your status madam
one was rather hoping to fly under the radar but one is a member of the royal family
which member madam
im princess margaret
it is most surely an honour to meet you
and may i say how well you look
especially taking into account that you died nine years ago
your real name please madam
graham comes into the chaotic office
the bookish official mr chidambram is behind the desk
good morning sir
did i not say that we will contact you when there is information regarding your inquiry
yes you did say that
while it is most pleasant to see you your presence does not actually accelerate our investigation
ill try not to come in tomorrow
i expect i will see you then
none of the operators are on the phone
instead they are sitting in a semi circle looking curiously at evelyn
who is sitting next to jay a little daunted by the attention
you ring in the morning
lets assume the person answering will be a woman
she will have had her breakfast
tea or coffee
semi skimmed milk always
if shes under shell be contemplating yet another diet over shell have more or less given up and be eating toast
the radio may be playing or more likely daytime tv
a chat show or a programme with a moderator speaking to a panel of young women whose boyfriends have all slept with their mothers
the girlfriends mothers i mean not their own
although anyway then the boyfriends usually come out and everybody fights
sunaina is in the audience
she calls out
im not surprised people hang up on us
thats the point
when the phone rings and its this robot nobody wants a machine but its almost worse when its a person behaving like one
all these sales cliches just strung together
your call is important to us
well then sound like it
your custom is valuable
dont ever say that
service is our middle name
yes when your middle name is shantanu
which is beautiful
you people are young vibrant real
im sure the typical housewife would enjoy talking to each and every one of you
her morning sounds like fun
what are you doing here
i suppose im not typical anymore
is that the sort of thing
madge is at her mirror doing her make up with great care
she looks beautiful
madge walks up the gravel path towards the magnificent building
shes superbly dressed looks great
she goes up to the barman
would there be any wealthy single men in tonight
there is one
madge puts some money into his breast pocket
perhaps you could seat me next to him
this way madam
he leads her along across the terrace
madge follows checking her hair her breath etc
the barman reaches an ornate suite of furniture
theres someone sitting there his back to us an elegant arm draped over the side of the chair
his royal highness prince michael of kent
the man rises from his chair and turns
and madge is left staring at norman
theres a pause
then madge reaches into the barmans breast pocket and removes her money
ill have that back thank you very much
graham comes through the courtyard heads for his room
muriel is on her verandah
muriel nods at him and he goes on into his room
a moment later jean sits down next to muriel
you know where he goes
i know you know
but you wont tell me
muriel says nothing
i can get hobnobs out here you know
i know a way
as many as you want
milk or plain
public records office
a huge construction centuries old with a series of steps reaching down deep into the earth so people can climb down to get their water
young couples sit on the steps in the evening heat boys leap into the water
sonny and sunaina are watching the swimmers
my father used to bring me to this well to swim
he said the water was better and so were the people we would meet
he would have liked you so much
sunaina smiles at this
my mother doesnt want us to be married
she hasnt met me yet
she doesnt need to meet you sunaina absorbs this
she knows you are not from delhi
that you have no family money and work in a call centre
you are a part of a new india she cannot welcome
isnt this where you tell her what you want
that conversation will be easier when the hotel is a success
do you love me
i have found a new investor
i am most optimistic that he will enable us to move forward with phase two of the marigold hotel shouldnt you finish phase one first
in business if you stand still you move backwards
no i have that wrong
if you stand still you are overtaken by people going the other way
wait you didnt answer the question
do you love me
my feelings for you cannot be reduced to a single word
its a nice word sonny
and people like hearing it
my mother is wrong
it is you who are too good for me
you say that a lot
you shouldnt ill start to believe you
they watch the boys in the water
madge and norman are sitting together
norman is looking across at the bar where an attractive older ex pat lady is sitting thus far resisting normans attempts to catch her eye
i still think youre cramping my style
you have no style to cramp
that lady at the bar keeps looking at me
as one would something in a museum
why must you mock
i just want to feel young again to be needed as much as i need if only for one night one wonderful night
tell me you dont know how that feels
silence for a bit
give me a minute
then join us
she gets up heads towards the bar
where she sits a couple of seats away from the woman
who is called carol
she sits there a moment then sighs and starts to talk to the barman
many years ago that man over there gave me the most extraordinary night of my life
he may seem coarse and uncouth but that only disguises a tenderness and an exquisite sensitivity to a womans needs norman arrives at the bar
those drinks not ready yet
madge turns to carol
they say patience is passion tamed
how do you do
as in christmas
so what brings you to jaipur carol
what brings you to jaipur
i run a small boutique travel agency
but ive actually lived here all my life
my father worked in the foreign office
youre very fit
i beg your pardon
i mean you look like you keep yourself in shape
well i did join a gym last year
it cost a fortune and i didnt get any fitter
apparently you have to actually go
then realizes that it was a joke lets out a too loud bray of laughter
and so what do you do norman
im normans in business
you tell her
although these days theres rather more ex than im if you see what i mean
im afraid i dont
madge gets up
i have to splash some water on my face
please god i drown in it
she heads for the bathroom
norman and carol share another silence
well look its been lovely chatting
no it hasnt
but i really carol
she was about to go stops
can we drop all this pretence
and start again
im not charming
im not good at repartee
and im not a plutocrat with the sexual capacity of a rutting rhino
my name is norman
and im lonely
my name is carol
so am i
madge comes out of the bathroom
like darwins finches we are slowly adapting to our environment
and when one does adapt my god the riches that are available
madge looks across the bar
and is startled to see norman and carol chatting up a storm laughing together
as she watches norman orders more drinks then turns smiling back to his new friend
madge walks slowly out of the bar and into the night
evelyn is at her computer typing
there is no past that we can bring back by longing for it ajit is pushing muriel down to the gate for her morning constitutional
only a present that builds and creates itself as the past withdraws
jay is counting out cash into evelyns hand her first paycheck
and india like so many things in life like life itself i suppose is about what you bring to it
ajit is pushing muriel through a poor neighborhood
muriel is looking left and right astounded by the life she sees
where are we
janta colony kachi basti
what happened to my usual route
anokhi has invited you to her home
you didnt tell me
youd have said no
jean is sitting reading a book
will you check in at the bank
douglas emerges from the bathroom
i checked yesterday
and the day before
will you be staying in again
why do you ask that every morning
because i hope for a different answer
because i think youll be hurt if i dont
and because its not healthy for you to spend all day and every day in the confines of the hotel
he goes back into the bathroom
jean changes the subject
i didnt sleep a wink
the tap in there never stops dripping
i talked to young wasim about it
what did he say
it was in hindi
douglas comes out of the bathroom holding the tap
i thought i might get it fixed myself
no time like the present
actually i say that but i enjoyed yesterday and im optimistic about tomorrow too
i wish i could say the same
so do i
jean sits for a while looking utterly disconsolate and lost
then she gets up goes over to the balcony
down below she can see graham leaving
madge is sitting on a chair
i gather the night went well
would you like to hear about it
not in the least
because youre going to
two drinks some sexually charged douglas comes out carrying a tap
and heads out of the archway
they watch him leave
two drinks some sexually charged banter and we were heading back to her place
bidding the rickshaw farewell i walked her to the door
and there my young friend i leaned forward and i kissed her
is that all
you didnt seal the deal
we have a date next week
what is wrong with you
i wanted to prolong the anticipation
to spend some time with the knowledge that soon im going to eat drink and laugh with someone hold her to me kiss her softly
then go back to her place and get my end away
the market is buzzing with commerce
evelyn is at a stall selling fabrics talking to the vendor akram
holding up a pashmina bow much for this please kitna one thousand rupees ek hazaar thank you
she reaches for her wallet
then douglas speaks from behind her
no no forgive me
thats not how it works
evelyn turns happy to see him
and to you
sorry to butt in but you dont ask him how much he wants you just tell him how much youll pay
shell give you two hundred
absolutely no more final offer
one thousand rupees
now walk away
i know what im doing
evelyn complies and they turn and walk away
the thing is you see i did actually want to buy that
to brighten up my room
hell come after us
do you think so
this is how the game is played
just keep on walking
they push through the crowds
hes playing it cool but hell come
they keep walking
hes playing it very cool
they keep walking
then douglas stops
evelyn looks at him
hes not coming
theyre back at akrams stall
evelyn counts out the money
eight hundred and fifty nine hundred nine hundred and fifty one thousand
she turns to douglas smiles
youll get him next time
then she notices something
why are you carrying a tap
jean gives up on the sentence she has already read a hundred times and snaps her book shut
she stands then sits again
ajit is now pushing muriel through a poverty stricken slum
the people live on the streets or in collapsing tin shacks
everywhere there is struggle and deprivation
and yet the pervasive atmosphere is nowhere near as depressing as we would expect
the colours are bright the smiles on the childrens faces even brighter
not that muriel can recognise the joy of course
shes horrified by her surroundings
and acutely aware of the stares of the slum dwellers
a primitive brick and cement hut one of the few amongst dwellings made mostly from sticks and plastic bags
a bunch of young kids are fascinated by muriels wheelchair pushing it around and taking turns to sit on it
muriel sits on the only chair
opposite squashed together as if posing for a photograph are all the generations of anokhis family anokhi herself her husband mother grandmother and several children
they all smile at muriel
a long pause
then muriel turns to ajit
how soon can i leave
douglas is talking to jamshed who works behind the counter
evelyn sits outside
you see what i think and of course im no expert is that the valve seat has eroded so well need the washer changed and a new seat re ground
douglas glances back at evelyn
who betrays not the slightest scepticism
jamshed studies the tap
the gland nut has come away from the spindle
well of course it could be that too
can you fix it
most expensively indeed
jamshed takes the tap to a workstation at the back starts to fiddle with it
douglas joins evelyn
i was in a tuk tuk the other day didnt seem to be taking the usual route back to the hotel
it turned out that the driver had decided to take me to another hotel that he was sure i would prefer
and of course one wants to believe that he genuinely had my welfare at heart and that it wasnt run bg his brother in law
one wants to trust in general dont you think
but you never really know do you
jamshed stops fiddling with the tap
and takes a hammer to it
the day i met my husband was the day the fair came to town
my girlfriend and i went on the carousel
her horse was fine
but when the ride began i felt mine give a little like it might collapse
then these strong arms were around me holding the horse together
and a voice in my ear said just trust me
and i did
until the day he died
the sale of our flat went through last week
i had to sell it to pay off hughs debts
ive been forced to get a job out here
which in fact i love
but even at sonnys rates i still couldnt make ends meet
after what my own husband did to our life savings
you never know
jamshed holds up the tap
which is now in several parts
you must be buying another
jean walks down the path to the gate
she stops looks fearfully at the chaotic sea of humanity outside
shes unable to move
finally she steps out
and is of course immediately assaulted by the assorted kids beggars street vendors etc
as anxiety begins to engulf her she quickens her pace brushing through them as best she can until she is almost running
muriel is still at the tea party
she wants to thank you for your kindness
i havent been kind
youre the only one that acknowledges her
anokhi brings out a plate of food
im not eating that
you will insult her very deeply if you do not
muriel looks up
theyre all still watching waiting smiling
she looks at anokhis grandmother as dignified as she is old
muriel reaches out takes something off the tray
and has a bite
its not too bad
id still rather a scotch egg
then she sees something through the open doorway the children have turned her wheelchair on its side and are spinning the wheels
shes on her feet in a flash
get off it you dirty thieving bastards
several terrified faces turn
one little girl starts to cry
everyone is staring at muriel
i didnt see
they were playing
jean is now in a tuk tuk lurching and weaving through the traffic a handkerchief clasped firmly over her mouth panic in her eyes
the corridors are full of people patiently waiting their turn to grapple with a vast bureaucracy
reaching the top of the staircase jean takes it all in
she walks down another corridor
through a doorway she sees graham at the desk talking to mr chidambram
in the office
but ive filled out that form
ive given it to you
there is a process
you are making an enquiry
for each enquiry a form must be filled in
but its the same enquiry i make every day
and therefore the same form you must fill in
graham glances towards the doorway catches sight of jean
their eyes lock then jean pulls back out of sight panicked
jean is hurrying down a corridor
behind her graham emerges from a doorway and calls to her mrs ainslie
jean and graham are sitting in an elegant tea room
jean is still very shaken
i dont know how you can bear this country
what do you see that i dont
in the light the colours the smiles the people who see life as a privilege not a right and so teach me something every day
the waiter brings their tea
is this milk pasteurized
but thats not true is it
youre just lying to me right now itll be fine
the waiter goes
its a pleasant surprise to see you out and about
she looks at him
where were you going
to the bank
was going to the bank
not that theres any reason to think something has changed
but our daughter you see she did promise and one does try to remain optimistic
one has to
otherwise graham worries she might be about to break down
he reaches across the table puts his hand on hers
she leans forward puts her other hand over his holds on tightly
graham is startled
he tries gently to pull back but she holds on
is it possible you feel the same
she brings his hand to her mouth kisses it
the way you talk to me
your compassion your understanding the wonderful tender consideration it had to be more than just im gay
she stares at him
graham says nothing
jean lets go of his hand
of course i see
the ghastly inappropriateness of it all settles on them both
i appear to have humiliated myself
and embarrassed you
im not embarrassed
jean smiles wanly grateful for his lie
like i said
this country is driving me mad
shall we go
evelyn is outside in the courtyard
we dont see douglas
evelyn waits a moment
how about now
contd oh good lord
the sound of a flowing tap
contd and now
the tap stops
contd no drip
he appears in the doorway triumphant
he walks towards her hand in the air
evelyn just looks at him
shes never hi fived anyone in her life
after a moment douglas puts his hand down
ive never done that before
it just seemed appropriate
jean has appeared at the other side of the courtyard
douglas senses her mood moves towards her
mrs ainslie how are you
did you have a good day
jean doesnt answer
shes staring at douglas
who looks so happy
let me tell you about ours
your husband of many a year who has never even known which end of a hammer to use has actually managed to we have to get out of here
what did you say
i cant stay in this country a moment longer
do excuse me
she makes a tactful exit
jean is going past douglas into their room
i dont understand pick a reason
the climate the squalor the poverty she goes past him into their room
we should never have come
this whole trip is a grotesque fantasy
its time to go home
jean starts to pack
whos paying for the tickets
not hearing him look at us
a group of self deluding old fossils traipsing around as if its our bloody gap year
humiliating ourselves not us we cant pay
and i dont see you asking our friends we should just face up to the truth
that were all old were all past it
thats the real truth the raw unvarnished fact of the matter
all were good for now is the beige bloody bungalow with the sodding panic button in the sodding corner
she stops packing and subsides onto the bed crying quietly
nobody speaks for a while
we just have to make the best of it darling
i really think thats the best thing to do
when i want your opinion ill give it to you
an impossibly small roadside clinic
norman is sitting there the only man in three rows of brightly dressed women
dr rama comes out of the consulting area
mr john smith
the doctor looks at norman who has forgotten his own alias
dr rama contd mr john smith
norman jumps up
sonny is at the flower market sitting on his motor bike waiting for the flower vendor to tie up his bundle of marigolds
hes on his phone
pick up pick up pick up
the phone is answered at the other end
sunaina i must see you
if i cannot hold your body against mine i swear i will go mad
we cut to the call centre
its not sunaina on the phone but jay who is standing next to her
i yearn for you i burn for you i think its my sister youre burning for there sonny boy
thank you jay
jay hands the phone to sunaina
private line sunaina
do those words mean nothing to you
he took the phone
what could i do
i miss you
i miss you every moment
come and see me
i cannot tonight
it is my parents th wedding anniversary
tell your mother that
come late youll be asleep
ill be waiting
youll be asleep
but i can wake you in that special way
you will sneak in
im not ashamed
neither am i
there is no shame
you do not have to sneak
all the same if you did want to be very quiet and not let anyone see you it couldnt hurt
norman is talking to dr rama
im worried theres no lead in my pencil
i dont know what that means
no snap in my celery
im still not quite with you
i plan to party hearty tonight but i cant guarantee that my love gun will fire
mr smith will the lance dance and the trouser lion roar
what is your problem
i dont know if i can still have sex
im not a young man anymore doctor
and im a little bit scared
truth be told im a lot scared
how long since youve been with a woman
ive got some pills thatll help
the back of the hotel where sonny envisages his phase two development
anokhi is cleaning pots
young wasim sits in the corner
ajit has just wheeled muriel into the courtyard
i wanted to tell you something
anokhi looks up
tell her i was glad to come glad she invited me
glad to meet her family
she asks if you have children
i looked after somebody elses
this one family years i was with them
i ran the house looked after the money did it all cared for them like they were my own
ajit starts to translate
but muriel doesnt wait
thats the mistake see
you dont want to get like that to start feeling part of something
one day they decided i needed some help
i was grateful i tried to teach her
not just the books but how to crisp up the bacon like the gentleman preferred it the way the little one liked to have her hair brushed
the things you only know if you care
but then they said i was no longer useful to them
thanked me for my service
as if thats all it was
i got a flat in the end
im the only one in the building not a foreigner
more indians there than here
but before i came to this place my biggest problem was what to do with all the time i had
because that flats so small i can have the whole place spotless in half an hour
and then what am i supposed to do for the rest of the day
theres silence for a bit
then ajit speaks
did you want me translate that as well
its the first time weve seen this
muriel stops thrusts something into ajits hand
give her these
ajit hands anokhi what muriel gave him a packet of chocolate hobnobs
this time its muriel who cannot meet anokhis eye
tries to hide her desire to leave
ajit turns her chair and pushes her away
over this the sound of singing normans on his rooftop under the primitive spout of water that passes as his shower
hanging from a nail in the wall the battery radio is pumping out a bizarre indian cover version of the chic song le freak
norman is naked and singing along lustily
aaaaaah freak out
le freak cest chic
aaaah freak out
feet slapping in the soapy water he performs a nifty disco move
sonny is in his office going through the accounts
theres a strange ringing somewhere nearby
he pays no attention then stops and thinks for a moment
then realises what it is
he sweeps the pile of papers off the desk starts frantically looking for the telephone
graham and evelyn are having drinks
ive been getting out and about as much as i can but i feel ive hardly scratched the surface
and of course id love to see udaipur
the lake you talked about
id love to take you
perhaps he breaks off
douglas and jean have come in
jean looks rather desperate
an awkward moment
good evening mrs ainslie
please allow me
he pulls a chair out for her
she shoots him a look of passionate gratitude for his exquisite sensitivity
youre very kind
but i rather think ill turn in early
she goes into her room
muriel is sitting outside her room doing the crossword
madge is coming through the arch stops dead
norman is standing in front of her on his way out
he looks transformed
and rather handsome
is this it
this is it
youre not worried about the danger of having sex at your age
if she dies she dies
sonny sprints into the courtyard
progress mrs donnelly mrs hardcastle
the wheel is turning most assuredly in our favour
he shoots up the stairs
douglas graham and evelyn are looking at the menu
sonny bursts in
what is it sonny
they are working they are working
that is great news
what are working
the telephones of the marigold hotel
i must tell everybody
i must tell my mother
he runs off
you have a phone call
graham evelyn and douglas are walking quickly up a quiet street
its a false alarm
theres no way they could find anything in that office
they probably just picked an address at random just to keep me off their backs
im sure thats what happened
its going to be nothing
dont you think its going to be nothing
i think you should knock on the door and see
yes i should
some men sit under a tree playing cards
across the street graham approaches a house
at a polite distance evelyn and douglas wait
graham knocks at the open door
a woman gaurika appears
she stares at graham
im sorry to disturb you so late
my name is graham dashwood
a long time ago i i know who you are
i am afraid i dont know you
i am gaurika
the wife of manoj
after a fraction of a im very pleased to meet you
and if you could if you would tell him that i called around id appreciate that very much he breaks off
shes walked past him looking to the other side of the road
he turns to look at the men playing cards
gaurika calls in hindi
a beautiful looking man looks up
he looks across at the house
stands up slowly as graham walks across the street towards him
graham reaches him
the two men just stand there for a moment
then they hug very tightly
from the steps of the house gaurika watches
evelyn looks at her fascinated
across the street manoj and graham are still holding each other unable to let go
douglas and evelyn are walking
a tiny bit sloshed
first time going in to london with my dad on his commute
hed always been so extraordinary to me so unique
but there he was standing on the station platform utterly indistinguishable from all the other men in suits
and then of course a few years later i was one of them
hated my job
sorry talking too much
blame a good dinner out
what was she thinking
i beg your pardon
she knew who graham was
had he told her
dyou think well find out tomorrow
not me im heading up to the badi mahal palace
very excited been reading all about it
i would if i could remember a word
then douglas suddenly grabs her
and pulls her out of the way of a motor bike zooming past them
sunaina hasnt realised she nearly hit them and powers on towards the marigold
douglas and evelyn stand for a moment startled holding each other
something passes between them that embarrasses them both
then they part quickly guiltily
theyre outside a small restaurant and with exquisite timing a group of musicians start to play a romantic tune
nice meal please
weve eaten thank you
they continue on their way
slightly further apart than before
its the middle of the night and everythings quiet or as quiet as it can be in the middle of the usual night time indian cacophony
sunaina parks her bike outside the hotel goes on in
sonny is sleeping peacefully
sunaina moves across the courtyard
not sneaking exactly
but making no sound
sonny sleeps on
sunaina is definitely sneaking now
she aims down the passage towards sonnys room
sonny stirs but doesnt wake up
sunaina comith esno te bedroom
she takes off her clothes
and climbs naked into bed beside the sleeping figure
a loud scream
in a different bed in a different room sonny wakes up
its sunaina thats screamed
because shes in bed with madge
who couldnt be happier
a midnight booty call
how utterly marvellous
sonny hares out of his temporary bedroom and races down the corridor towards madges room
sunaina has jumped out of the bed and across the room grabbing one of madges generous scarves to cover her nakedness
im so sorry im so sorry
i dont know what your name is but im incredibly sorry
most action ive had in weeks
if you could just please not sonny bursts in
do not worry mrs hardcastle
i can explain each and every thing
oh my god you are naked
he turns to madge
mrs hardcastle i must apologise with deep and profound sincerity how could you not tell me you werent in your room
yes sunaina to you too i must apologise with equally deep and profound sincerity
just let me get dressed and no no quicker than that
you must leave before mrskapoor flings open the door
what is going on here
she sees the nearly naked sunaina
mrs kapoor contd no no no no no
this is a respectable hotel not a brothel
you get out
and mrs hardcastle i expected better of you
actually this is exactly what i expected of you but nevertheless mrs kapoor im sunaina
since i will not be paying for your services your name is of no interest to me
how do you know mine
sunaina is shocked to realise that mrs kapoor doesnt know her name
sonny steps forward reluctantly
is my sunaina
the girl who my son described as not too modern
this is getting interesting
tell me please
mrs kapoor contd is there anyone in this building you havent slept with
mummyji do not get the wrong idea
sunaina was not here to be with mrs hardcastle
she was here to have sex with me
mrs kapoor turns to sunaina
who is speechless
this is the sort of woman you are
each to her own
but do not ever try and tell me that you are suitable wife for my son
find your clothes and go
i dont expect to see you again
sunaina is leaving the hotel angry and humiliated
evelyn and douglas are coming up the path
and now sunaina is even more humiliated
sunaina roars away on her scooter
the same street
the sun is just coming up and traders are setting up their stalls spreading their wares on rugs on the ground
one trader is unloading some fruit
a few guava roll off the edge of his wagon
someone picks them up for him
its graham who smiles as he puts them back
the trader gives him a fresh one
graham takes it and walks on munching the delicious fruit
a contented man
norman is sitting on a stone bench under a spreading tree
how did it go
norman turns to see graham standing above him
i have seen the top of the mountain
and it is good
graham nods sits down next to him
they gaze out at the waking city
i saw someone yesterday a man i hadnt seen for many years
a man ive loved all my life
norman is a bit startled by this
smiling unperturbed i didnt know how hed been in the meantime didnt want to guess
i brought disgrace upon him and his family and imagined he might hate me for it
but we talked all night
hes been happy
hes led a peaceful life married to a woman who understood him and loved him nonetheless
but hes never forgotten me
thats what he said
i asked his forgiveness anyway
he said he had nothing to forgive me for
that instead i should forgive myself
all that time
all that time i believed id sentenced him to a life of shame
when i was the one in prison
but not any more
silence for a while
top of the mountain
norman smiles then stands and goes on inside
graham settles back into his chair looks out at the world
not any more
norman comes into the courtyard
madge sipping from a cup of chai calls down from her verandah
how was the night
madge just stares after him
norman on the stairs to his room
he stops catches his breath
graham is watching a stunningly beautiful bird
a snow crane white and magnificent
its on the grass in front of him
then it opens its huge wings takes off
and flies up into the bright blue sky
its an extraordinary sight
as graham watches the snow crane swoop and dip it appears suddenly to slow and stall until it seems to hang in the air almost motionless
norman crosses the rooftop to his bedroom
he comes inside sits on the bed
graham is still sitting in the garden
he doesnt turn round
evelyn has come out to the garden
she goes over to him
its been rather an extraordinary night all round
first tell me your news and then she breaks off
graham is dead
of course it was inevitable
put enough old people in the same place it wont be too long before one of them goes
jean douglas madge norman and muriel shocked and sobered a train is crossing the endless fields
evelyn stares out of the window
madge norman douglas and jean are behind her
opposite sits manoj
evelyn turns to look at him and at gaurika manojs wife who sits beside him
we all know itll happen but few of us know when
graham died of a heart attack evidently not his first
so he had a better idea than most what was coming he just neglected to tell us
three white vehicles are driving across a narrow causeway which barely rises above the surface of the lake
they seem to be floating
clouds of dust billow behind them
there was talk of sending the body home but manoj felt he should have a hindu burial
at the place they had visited together
not a holy place
although for them perhaps it was
a ruined garden surrounded by the waters of the lake crumbling pillared porticoes and arches
what must once have been a royal retreat is now long abandoned and overgrown
grahams friends stand watching the pyre transfixed by the flames
manoj dressed in white stands with gaurika
he recites a hindi prayer
a body takes a long time to be consumed
many hours for the mourners to remember their dead
the fire must be lit at dawn and by sunset there must be nothing left but ash
stripped to the waist manoj walks into the water holding a bowl
where do our souls go
is that all of us that is left behind
perhaps the most we can ask is that when we do shuffle off we do so knowing that we were loved manoj pours graham onto the water
the ashes shim r and dance caught in the gentle currents
muriel and anokhi are in the servants garden
young wasim sits silently in the corner
so theres a process they call it pickling
i have no idea what it is or how they do it but whoever invented it was a smart man
but the real genius was the one who introduced an onion into the system
that i could never have thought of
ajit looks at her ready to translate
no forget it
muriel is looking out at the yard
she sees mrs kapoor talking to some surveyors
theyre mapping out the building
mrs kapoor sees muriel watching her comes over to them
mrs donnelly what are you doing here
you should not be here talking with this one
im helping her clean
if these pots get any dirtier youll have to serve the food with penicillin
we have other rooms
go to one of them instead
while this is still a hotel
she turns back to the surveyors
whats her problem
whats happening here
ajit cant answer
but he knows a man who can
he points to young wasim
he can tell you
a stunning view over the city
madge is having a drink with norman
douglas is sitting on the wall but keeps looking down towards the stairs
when someone dies you think about your own life
and in my case there is less of it in front of me than behind
and i dont want to grow older
i dont want to be condescended to ignored and marginalised by society
to become peripheral to the action
madge coat d i dont want to be the first person let off the plane in a hostage crisis
they laugh together
and dont even see douglas go
the landing is large and open to the sky
evelyn has just come up the stairs to go to her room
shes leaning against the stone baluster
i wondered where youd been
douglas is on the stairs above her
were all up top having a drink
i went to see gaurika
i wanted to ask her what she knew
and the answer was that she knew everything that hed loved another man and always would
he told her when the marriage was arranged
they had no secrets from each other none
suddenly shes crying
unable to stop
douglas puts his arms around her and holds her to him
and thats right dont you see
that must be right
because what is the point of a marriage in which nothing is shared
her words hang in the air
they stand there for a moment
jean has come out of her room and stands there watching them
mrs greenslade might i have my husband back now
they spring apart
she walks off back into the room
douglas turns to evelyn
yes of course
evelyn goes quickly to her room leaving him standing there
douglas closes the door
she was upset
spare me your explanations
dyou think im jealous
i dont see why else you would have embarrassed me
you were already doing a perfectly good job of embarrassing yourself
can you imagine how ghastly its been for everyone to watch you mooning around after that simpering doe eyed ex housewife taking advantage of her loneliness and god can you
do you have any idea what a terrible person youve become
jean is stunned into silence
all you give out is this endless negativity a refusal to see any kind of light and joy even when its right in your face and a desperate need to
squash any sign of happiness in me or anyone else its a wonder i dont fling myself at the first kind word or gesture that comes my way
but i dont
out of some dried out notion of loyalty and respect neither of which i ever bloody get in return
theres a long silence
i checked my emails
she hands him a piece of paper
evelyn comes onto the terrace and heads for madge and norman
she picks up madges glass
are you alright
i just need some water
she drains the glass
that was a gin and tonic
i know that now
good evening the ainslies
douglas and jean are approaching them
how are you both
were particularly well
douglas tell them our news
she looks to him waits
he says nothing
so she turns and smiles
were going home
sonny is with his investor mr maruthi
they emerge from the upper courtyard onto the terrace overlooking the back of the hotel
and so i would ask you to loosen the strings on your purse mr maruthi and to do it most rapidly
so that phase two development of the best exotic marigold hotel can begin with immediate effect
mr maruthi looks down sees muriel
shes with anokhi ajit and young wasim
he calls down to her
mrs donnelly i believe
sonny spots the danger tries to lead mr maruthi away
and now if you would please be following me to the ground floor mr maruthi ignores him calls down again
how are things at the hotel
mr maruthi better
theyre going better
sonny takes a moment to recover
such is the inevitable result of a prolonged stay at the marigold hotel
and now mr maruthi has spotted something else
the surveyors who are still taking their measurements
what are those men doing
glancing back for a moment working for me mr maruthi
to create a home for the elderly so wonderful that they will simply refuse to die
stare death in the face and say follows mr maruthis what are those men doing
through the window muriel watches sonny confronting his mother
mummyji what is going on here
i have spoken to your brothers
they want to sell the hotel
these men are here to value the building
they are valuing the land
my brothers do not care about the building
they will knock it down
they could just wait a month for it to fall down of its own accord
you joke mummyji but inside i know you are not laughing
you do not want to see this dream destroyed
send these people away
no my son
it is too late
mrs kapoor is at the desk going through the accounts
sonny stands opposite her
mummyji please these figures do not support your argument
there is still time to turn things around
with a small injection of funds we can who is trusting you with that money
you who cannot run a chai stand
just like your father
then sonny speaks quietly
do i remind you of him so much
is that why you must be cruel to me
you think i am cruel
you loved my father
and he loved this hotel
there will not be a third
say goodbye to all this sonny
and come with me to delhi
your life will become easier
not easier mummyji
mrs kapoor comes back to the desk fiddling with some paperwork discomfited
she turns to the doorway
muriel is there in her chair
can i help you
do you know how to use a computer
i assume you are joking
mrs ainslie said she had an address where i could get some things i need
she said i could get them on the line
i wish you luck
mrs kapoor smiles and leaves
muriel watches her go then turns to the computer
her fingers fly across the keyboard
the train rattles its way through the night
jean is chatting away in a better mood than weve seen her for some time
evelyn listens in silence
the whole thing is actually tremendously exciting
not just getting on a plane but getting on a plane and turning left
and home in time for our th wedding anniversary
we havent yet decided how to mark the occasion
perhaps a minutes silence
ajit keeps watch while muriel is at the printer
waiting as it disgorges pages
the tuk tuks are lined up
hailing a tuk tuk two should fit us all i think
im actually going to walk
apparently theyre getting ready for a festival
perhaps youd like one of us to accompany you
im happy to walk with you
ill be fine
evelyn speaks to both douglas and jean
im delighted for your daughters success
i wish you all every happiness
evelyn turns and walks away
douglas and jean are in the tuk tuk with madge and norman
there is a sombre atmosphere
a motor bike hurtles past them going the other way
was that sonny
a phone is ringing
christopher is still in bed his wife polly asleep next to him
cant believe his ears ma
evelyn stands under the awning of the ticket office
i just wanted to hear your voice
no im sorry i didnt think about the time
how are you
how are the boys
she listens to him
shes holding back tears
oh good im glad youve been reading it
yes ive made some very good friends
no im fine of course i am
as much as she had wanted to speak to him she now wants the conversation to be over
i think my money is running out id better go
goodbye for now darling
ill call again later
she hangs up
and stays there with her hand on the phone
out on the street sonny is pulling up
she looks over to him
where are the others
theyre on their way to the hotel
sonny looks around at a loss
whats the matter
i wanted to warn you before you see for yourself of the most momentous changes that are occurring absolutely all of them without question for the very positive
what are you talking about
i am delighted to announce the closing of the best exotic marigold hotel and the joyful return of all of its inhabitants to their home country
norman and madge have arrived back at the hotel
mrs kapoor is breaking the news to them
please relax in the knowledge that your journey home is being arranged and paid for by the hotel
our journey here was arranged and paid for by the hotel and look how that went
id rather walk back to england
id rather not go back at all
a voice comes behind them
carol has come out of the courtyard
why would you have to
sonny and evelyn are still talking
and for myself the news is even better
i shall be moving to delhi to live with my mother and furthermore i shall be wed to a most suitable person of her choice whom i look forward very
much to meeting before i spend the rest of my life with her
but what about your girlfriend
she is no longer my girlfriend
this is a disaster
then we must treat it just the same as we would treat a triumph is that not what your mr kipling tells us
although of course here we have a problem
because i sunil indrajit kapoor have never had a triumph so of course i do not know how to treat one
no all i have had is an constant series of disasters interspersed with the occasional catastrophe an unending stream of total sonny do you love her
have you told her you love her
it is because i love her that i must not tell her
she can do so much better than me
and you have told her that
women love it when you say that kind of thing
its a powerful aphrodisiac
no of course not
go and find her right now before you lose her forever
her future is hers to choose and so is yours
you can have anything you want sonny
you just need to stop waiting for someone to tell you you deserve it
or you can just keep failing yourself and hurting the ones you love mrs greenslade stop drilling
you have struck oil
he goes to his bike climbs on and rockets off
madge is sitting pensive
carol comes in
but we dont have to leave yet
i asked him to come and stay with me
is that wise
im not sure hes trained
you think its too soon
it doesnt matter what i think
it is too soon
but at our age we cant afford the luxury of taking it slow
and its either this or he goes home and i dont want him to go home
madge looks at her for a while
i wish you both the very best
you havent met anyone
single by choice
just not my choice
i actually think it might be over
and if thats gone im not quite sure whats left
did you know norman brought pills
the first night he stayed with me
they obviously did the trick
i saw them in his pocket
i didnt want it to be like that
so when i had the chance i swapped them
he went all night on two aspirin
its never over
norman appears with his one bag and his battery radio
sonny roars through the streets on his bike
she sees a taxi waiting outside the hotel
the houseboy is carrying douglas and jeans bags down to the car
evelyn comes into the courtyard
muriel is sitting there
the two women stare at each other
do you want him to see you
sonny is waiting at a junction texting into his mobile phone
douglas is checking they havent left anything
jean is at the door
sunaina picks up her mobile looks at the message
jean is sitting in the taxi which is driven by barum
douglas climbs in
my wallet i forgot my wallet
before jean has a chance to say anything he goes back in
she watches him go
douglas comes back into the courtyard heads towards the staircase to evelyns room
then muriel speaks from her verandah
shes not back yet
then perhaps you could tell her i said goodbye
he turns and walks out
evelyn is at her window listening
she turns to watch him leave
douglas gets back into the taxi
slamming the door false alarm
had it the whole time
sonny roars into the forecourt gets off his bike and runs into the building
a security guard goes to stop him but sonnys already running up the stairs
sonny keeps going up floor after floor
he reaches the seventh floor
jay appears on the landing above him
whats going on
sonny is doubled over totally out of breath
holds up a finger
i need to see sunaina
her shifts not over
and when it is she doesnt want to see you
jay you are the son my mother wished i was an intelligent man with a strong head for business
you see things as they are not as you wish them to be
so fuck off out of my way
or you can give her a message
sunaina is standing against the wall unseen by sonny listening
tell her from me what i should have told her the day we met
what i will announce to anyone who asks
and many who do not
sunaina speaks to jay
including your mother
including my mother
i will tell every mother in the land
what will you tell them
what will you tell them
the only thing that matters in this world
that i love you
and always will
and by you i mean sunaina jay not you
although if you are to be my brother in law i hope we can become better friends
why is he only saying this now
you ask him
why are you only saying this now
because sunaina love of my life no more will i believe that i am not worthy for only by loving you as you deserve will i become so
on sunainas face as she hears this
the cacophonous sound of drumming a small band of players are beating out a deafening syncopated rhythm as the ganeshi festival begins to unfold
sonny is on his bike sunaina riding side saddle on the back
theyre speeding through the city
sonny rockets through an arch way up a side street is confronted by a huge traffic jam
the ganeshi procession is bringing everything to a standstill
he does a u turn speeds off back the way they came
douglas and jean are sitting in the traffic jam
they call it rush hour but nothing actually moves
its not that funny
although i suppose its all about context isnt it
i mean douglas
if you say one more word ill kill you with my thumbs
muriel sits alone in the courtyard under her awning
then carol and norman appear from reception followed by mrs kapoor
they cross towards the arch
where dyou think youre going
you may well ask
madge is sitting under the shade of a tree
were moving in together
that point has been made
the hotel is closing
doesnt have to
everyone stares at muriel
she takes out the spreadsheets
ive been going over the accounts
if anything the traffic is now worse
jean and douglass taxi has progressed a few yards and is now wedged into the arch
the ganeshi procession is completely blocking the far entrance to the archway
jean gets out looks at the sea of unmoving traffic ahead and behind
this is ridiculous
it could go on for hours
theres no way were ever going to get out of here
maybe there is
a rickshaw arrives next to them swerving through the traffic
it is ridden by ifti
can you get us to the airport
sorry long way sore legs not possible
ill give you everything i have
step right in mind your head lets go
come on douglas
douglas gets the suitcases out of the trunk of the cab
sorry no manage people and cases
grabbing her suitcases what
two person no cases one person and cases
taking off her watch how about if i give you something else
still not possible
well get another flight
we can go back to the hotel and leave in the morning
jean you heard what he said
he cant do it
he can do one person and cases
yes but could fate find a better way to tell us what we need to hear
which is what
that its over
it was over a long long time ago
this is not the time to talk about this
lets wait till we i have to go douglas
i wont let you
no youll want to come after me
chase me to the airport and tell me everything will be fine
but please dont
because the truth is we both deserve more than weve had
youre just too kind and too loyal to admit it
i will be alright
im turning left
she climbs onto the rickshaw
as the drumming intensifies douglas stands holding his suitcase watching her weave through the traffic and out of sight
sonny and sunaina roar towards the hotel drive into the gate and up the path
mrs kapoor is studying the spreadsheets
i dont know what any of these figures mean
sonny and sunaina drive into the courtyard screech to a halt
mummyjit right here you do not need to shout
do you remember what my father used to say
that nothing happens unless first we dream
like him i have dreamt mummyji and like him i have failed
the marigold hotel is crumbling into dust
and it turns out i can live with that
but the one thing i will not do is live without this girl
to whom i did not introduce you properly before
this is sunaina shantanu palawat
the woman i love and wish to marry
i am very pleased to meet you mrs kapoor
sunaina puts out her hand
mrs kapoor will not take it
shaking her head no
i forbid it
i forbid this match
utterly and completely
do you hear me sonny
this cannot happen
and then a low rumbling sound comes from the corner
like a quiet volcano
young wasim is speaking
its a long poetic and heartfelt speech
unfortunately its in hindi
what is he saying
what he said to me i imagine
she turns to sunaina
can you help
he is saying
he is saying that he has been with this family as long as he can remember
given them a lifetime of service
and that he remembers another fight between two young people and their parents
and he remembers the moment where the young man stood up to his mother and said yes i want to marry this woman
yes she is from a different community
but she is smart she is beautiful and i love her
mrs kapoor contd i dont know who hes talking about
she offers sunaina her hand
mrs kapoor contd take care of my favourite son
sunaina shakes her hand
so im not clear now
am i staying or going
depends how you read the accounts
turns out the original plan is good it works
just not in the hands of an imbecile
i knew that plan was good
what the place needs is more money
unfortunately my investor mr maruthi has decided that while he greatly admires my endeavors he hes reconsidered
you spoke to him
so long as there is someone to help the manager
the manager needs no help
the manager needs a little help
so will you stay
norman looks at carol
id like to
in the shack on the roof
i sleep in the trees
we have a double room
and a fully working door
he points to grahams room
a guest has recently checked out
madge cant believe he just said that
ill think about it
on my own
youre off your game
lost your confidence maybe
but youre a thoroughbred
youll be back
and what about you mrs greenslade
evelyn has come down unnoticed by all
what about me mrs donnelly
we havent talked much you and my loss evidently
im not sure what i should do
nothing here has quite worked out as i hoped
most things dont
but sometimes what happens instead is the good stuff
havent you got work in the morning
besides hell be back
you dont know him
hes the most loyal man ive ever met
rupees says im right
at your current salary that should take you three months to pay off
muriel stands up
she starts to walk slowly but proudly across the courtyard
she reaches the doorway turns back
if youll excuse me someones waiting to help me make mango chutney
why did no one tell me about that stuff
who is the new assistant manager
are you thinking of applying for the job
she gestures for her wheelchair
sonny rushes up with it
she sinks down
thats enough exercise for one day
jean sits in the rickshaw surrounded by her luggage carried by iftis strong legs towards her future
the only real failure is the failure to try
evelyn is at her computer typing
and the measure of success is how we cope with disappointment
as we always must
douglas still holding his suitcase is surrounded by ganeshi drummers silhouetted against the lights of the city
the sound fades as he disappears into the celebration and is replaced by the gentle sound of temple bells ringing for morning prayers
we came here and we tried
all of us in our different ways
evelyn is still sitting fully dressed in her room
shes been up all night
her alarm clock buzzes
she turns it off
evelyn comes out of her room walks across the terrace
some achieved more than others
but we did our best
nothing else matters
evelyn walks through the courtyard and on out of the hotel
evelyn walks down the path towards the street
then douglas comes through the gate with his suitcase
they stand there looking at each other for a moment
it is isnt it
youre still here
i missed the plane
what about jean
putting down his i had quite an interesting night actually
i met the same taxi driver but this time i let him take me to his brothers hotel
which turned out to be less of a hotel and more of a brothel really
they gave me this pipe said it was apple tobacco but thats not what we called it when i was a student
so i made my excuses and left wanted some time to think
this city at night is extraordinary
of course the apple tobacco helped
i finally saw an elephant
silence for a bit
im late for work
she goes past him
she stops turns
what time do you finish
i get back about
how do you take it
with a little milk
she turns and walks away
perhaps its true we dont stop playing because we grow old we grow old because we stop playing
douglas is haggling with a motorbike mechanic
he seems to be having more success with the price than in earlier days
carol is lying on normans bed reading a book while he washes his socks in a bucket
all we really know about the future is that it will be different
madge is chatting vivaciously to someone
its the elegant older man we saw earlier
and he seems utterly smitten
so we must celebrate the changes
sonny and sunaina race through the streets on his motorbike
sonny raises a fist in salute
let them come
bring them on
because as someone once said everything will be alright in the end
coming from the other direction another motorbike douglas at the handlebars returning sonnys greeting
and on the pillion seat riding side saddle her scarf flying in the breeze is evelyn on her way home from work
contd so if its really not alright then trust me its not yet the end
