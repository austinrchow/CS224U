mike nichols marathon st
hollywood california moving through clouds
the clouds separate and far below we can see a giant outdoor amphitheatre
there is no sound but the wind
as we move closer to the amphitheatre we can hear snatches of words and phrases as though from a public address system
in cap and gown standing in front of a microphone
the wind is blowing
he has to hold on to the papers from which he is reading
thousands of expressionless students are sitting there
and today it is right that we should ask ourselves the one most important question what is the purpose of these years the purpose for all this demanding work the
purpose for the sacrifices made those who love us
were there not a purpose then all of these past years of struggle of fierce competition and of uncom promising ambition would be mean ingless
but of course there is a purpose and i must tell it to you
i ask you to remember this purpose always and i pledge that i shall endeavor to carry it with me forever
staring at him impassively
of impassive students seated watching of ben standing alone on the huge amphitheatre stage of closeups of ben speaking of loudspeakers of wind blown papers on the podium
continuing the purpose my fellow graduates the purpose is he stops trying to think of the word
he begins to sweat
shot podium of amphitheatre bens hands searching through the pages of his speech
the pages begin to blow away in the wind
there is a reason my friends and the reason is he is in a panic
he looks up from his papers at the audience
the audience is gone
the reason is the purpose is sound of the wind becoming the roar of an aircraft coming at us through the air
huge and empty
sound of aircraft
ladies and gentlemen we are about to begin our descent into los angeles sound of a sonic boom
his eyes open suddenly
the sound you have just heard is the landing gear locking into place
the los angeles weather is clear and the temperature is a pleasant
we do not expect any traffic delay and will make our four hour and eighteen minute flight plan smack on the nose
we enjoyed having you on board and look forward to seeing you again in the near future
pull back slowly from a closeup of a television screen with snow on it to reveal a long row of television sets along the ceiling of the aircraft
there is snow on all of them
pull back from the closeup of ben to reveal a row of passengers staring straight ahead their headsets on
ben turns and looks out the window
los angeles at night its lights stretching endlessly in every direction
sound muzac and the stewardess landing speech
under titles ladies and gentlemen please fasten your seat belts in preparation for the landing and observe the no smoking sign
after we land you will notice an increase in the sound level as the thrust of the engines is reversed to help reduce forward speed
ben and the other passengers on the automatic sidewalk
your attention please
american airlines flight number club service non stop to new york is now leaving from gate number
all aboard please
his eyes are open and he is trying to remember something
there are the sounds of many people talking and laughing in other rooms
a radio nearby plays music
after a while there is the sound of a door opening
the sounds of the people talking are lower
terhunes voice can be heard among them
associate editor of the college newspaper in his junior year managing editor in his senior year the sound of the door closing
terhunes voice and the voices of the other guests fade down
terhunes voice can be heard with varying clarity through the remainder of the sequence
after a few moments there is the sound of a light switch being snapped and light as though from an overhead fixture falls across bens face
he does not move
after a few moments there is the sound of the radio being whats the matter
bens mouth opens a little bit and closes again
the guests are all downstairs ben
theyre all waiting to see you

mcquire takes bens arm and steers him down the hall toward the back of the house and out through the back door
the pool is eerily lit

mcquire turns and walks back into the house
the people at the other end of the yard look toward ben

we can see through the windows of the house ben making his way through people trying to stop him and speak to him as he goes through rooms up the
stairs and to his room
sound of a door slamming
ben stands with his back against the door
the sounds of the party downstairs and as ben walks across the room to a window the sound of the wind
a shot long shot location over ben to pool area and people below
sound of the door opening
robinson enters the room
i guess this isnt the bathroom is it
its down the hall
they stand for a moment loocking at each other

the bathroom is down at the end of the hall
robinson moves into the room and sits on the edge of the bed
robinson i dont mean to be rude but mrs
robinson takes a cigarette from her purse and lights it
is there an ashtray in here
oh i forgot
the track star doesnt smoke
she blows out the match and puts it down carefully on the bedspread
ben picks up a wastebasket walks over to the bed picks up the match and puts it in the wastebasket
is it a girl

whatever it is youre upset about
im just sort of disturbed about things
there is a long pause
benjamin i want to ask you something

ben reaches into his pocket and hands mrs
robinson a set of car keys
here you take it
robinson looks at him

robinson shakes her head
there is a pause lets go
she throws the keys to him
he catches them
shooting through the open front door
braddock is talking to the terhunes at the door
ben and mrs
robinson come down the hall
robinson needs a ride home
ill be right back
braddock pats ben on the shoulder
robinson is walking ahead through the front door
as she passes the wonderful party
the car comes to a stop in the robinson driveway
they sit for a moment
she doesnt move
ben gets out and goes around to her side and opens the door

i want you to come in till i get the lights on
because i dont feel safe until i get the lights on
they move to the door
she takes out her key and opens the door

but its light in there now
ben turns and walks down the hall
they enter sunroom

she takes a step toward him
he puts his hand up and retreats around the other side of the chair

ladies and gentlemen your attention please for this after noons feature attraction
the sun shines brightly
standing and sitting around the pool are mr
braddock their friends mr
arnold and the arnold children peter and louise who are eight or nine
watching from across the fence on one side of the house the young girl from next door and her boy friend
across the fence on the other side of the house a quartet of adults formally dressed as though for a cocktail party holding drinks and watch ing
one of them holds a baby
the braddocks the arnolds and their children are dressed in california contemporary sport style the adults in styles infinitely too young for them the children in styles infinitely too old
braddock stands alone at the end of the pool near the house
the others are grouped more or less at the other end
braddock is hamming it up
hey over there i mean you

braddock has moved over by one of the windows of the house the window into the kitchen
he speaks quickly in a fake sotto voce towards the window

braddock has already moved away from the window and is readdressing his audience
what was i saying

they all laugh and some applaud

or im out over two hundred bucks so lets hear it for mr
braddock moves to the screen door and pushes it open
it slams against the wall inside
at the back of the hall inside the house stands ben dressed in a full length skin divers wet suit flippers on his feet the oxygen tank strapped to his
back the mask pushed up his forehead the air hose dangling
he holds a spear gun in his hand
the people applaud
the people in the backyard
his father stands just outside the screen door
folks this remarkable young man is going to perform for you some spectacular and amazing feats of daring in water that is over six feet deep bens arms come into
view and pull the mask down
we are now looking through the mask as we move forward down the hall
everything is slightly distorted through the glass
bens hand comes up again with the breathing apparatus in it
sound the rythmic pumping of air obliterating the sound of the people around the pool who seem to be applauding and chattering noiselessly
we move out of the door and toward the pool
braddock is running back and forth clapping his hands and delivering his now soundless pitch
we move down the steps and into the shallow end of the pool
braddock is moving along the side of the pool motioning toward us to come down to the deep end
he joins mr
arnold at the far end of the pool
they both begin to motion us toward them
we get to the deep end of the pool
braddock signals us with his hand to go under
he kneels down by the edge of the pool and reaches out with his hand and pushes us under
he has a big smile
we surface again and pan around for a last look
the figures through the slightly distorted glass of the mask of mrs
arnold and mrs
braddock watching and smiling the neighbors on each side of the house looking over their fences and laughing and pointing mr
arnold nodding encouragement and talking mr
braddock on his knees smiling and trying to reach out far enough to push us under
we go under and sink to the bottom of the pool
looking down on the pool on bens black suited body at the bottom and the people standing around the pool looking down into it
until there are thirty houses below us with its owners swimming playing eating cooking reading dancing sunbathing constructing and gardening around thirty pools
sound of bens breathing apparatus fading into the sound of the wind
hold for a few seconds then sound of a dime dropping into a pay phone and dialing
in a phone booth
the booth is in the entrance area of the hotel between the lobby and the driveway
ben holds the receiver to his ear
sound of phone ringing
robinson i dont quite know how to put this benjamin
look i was thinking about that time after the party where are you
and i was wondering if i could buy you a drink or something where are you
uh the taft hotel
did you get a room
now i know its pretty late and if youd rather give me an hour
ill be there in an hour
sound of her hanging up
ben hangs up slowly
he stands up in the booth looks around moves about uncomfortably for a few moments removes his jacket and carrying it folded across his arm in front of him leaves
the phone booth and crosses to the doors that lead to the main lobby
as he is about to go in the doors open and a group of very old people start coming out filling the doorway and moving very slowly muttering to each
other and helping each other out of the door and down the steps
ben holds one of the doors open for them and stands politely to one side
as they get through ben starts to move inside
at that moment a dozen young people dressed as though for a high school dance push him to one side and move past him into the lobby
he moves back against the other door holding it open and allowing them to go in first
he smiles politely and they pay no attention to him at all
he follows them into the lobby
they move toward the front desk and he moves with them
one of the boys at the front of the group leans in and says something to the clerk behind the desk
the clerk points across the lobby and says something to him
there are the sounds of an orchestra playing some where
the group of young people passes by the desk and ben moves in behind them
he pauses at the desk and looks apprehensively at the hundreds of pigeon holes against the wall with the room numbers painted under them and the keys dangling suggestively
can i help you sir
oh no im just he points vaguely in the direction of the other young people
are you here for an affair sir
terror and disbelief start in bens eyes
he looks helplessly at the clerk
the singleman party sir
the singleman party
its in the main ballroom
ahh thank you
ben backs off and turns and starts across the lobby
he puts on his jacket as he goes
he gets to the entrance to the main ballroom
he pauses at the door looks in
what he sees people dancing talking sitting etc
he turns back toward te lobby
what he sees the room clerk scross the lobby watching him
ben flashes a huge smile and points in toward the ballroom as though to express his joy at finding the singleman affair inside then turns back and enters the ballroom
as ben steps inside
four people stand in a row
official greeters they are a middle aged woman an older man an elderly lady and a twelve year old boy dressed formally and they are smiling with great determination
it is the older lady who has said hello
you must be one of the porters
she grasps bens hand and shakes it

ben backs out of the ballroom
ben crosses the lobby passing people going in and out of the hotel
he stops at the entrance of the veranda room this is a large room with a bar and many tables along the windows that look out over the hotel grounds
it is quite dark and cool inside and there are no more than a dozen people seated around
the camera stays at the door as ben walks into the room and crosses to the far end where he sits down at the table by the window
push in toward ben as he sits there
muzak is playing
in the door to the lobby in the b
she pauses looks into the room sees ben and starts toward him
ben is looking out the window
he does not see her approach
he rises quickly

he pulls out a chair for her
they sit down

ben tries to smile then looks out the window then down at the center of the table
may i have a drink
ben looks toward a passing waiter and raises his hand
the waiter pays no attention
ben looks back at mrs
he didnt see me
for a moment the noise in the room seems to recede
the waiter stops in his tracks turns toward them
the waiter moves to their table
the noise in the room comes back
the waiter looks at mrs

the waiter moves away
ben watches him go

he pushes the card and a pen toward ben
ben writes his name on the card and then stares at it for a moment crumples it up and fills out a second card

he hands ben the key
robinson sits patiently and calmly
her face betrays absolutely nothing as she stares ahead of her and sips her martini
she looks up
a waiter is standing next to the table with a telephone
the waiter plugs the phone into the wall socket next to the table and hands her the receiver
the waiter nods and leaves
into phone hello
benjamin where are you
can you look through the glass
robinson turns in her chair and looks through the glass into the lobby
ben is in the phone booth in the lobby no more than twenty feet away
can you see me now
yes i can
over bens shoulder we can see his face reflected in the glass door and through it mrs
robinson sitting in the veranda room
i got a single room

the desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious
i mean i dont know what their policy is but well do you want to go up first

the desk clerk looks up
i say ive got it
i got it all right
very good sir
ben walks out of shot
ben leaves elevator walks down corridor to hotel room and opens door
ben closes the door behind him and leans with his back against it for a few moments looking at the room
the only light is that coming in the window
ben turns on the light switch on the wall near the door
the room blazes with the light from three lamps and an overhead fixture
he turns the switch off
he crosses to the bathroom
ben steps in and turns on the light
ben steps out moves to the window
we see the pool area through the window
ben closes the blinds
there is a knock on the door
ben crosses to the door and opens it
robinson moves to the bureau and puts her purse and gloves on it
she looks at herself in the mirror for a moment then turns slowly looking at the room finally ending on bens face
she steps toward him
he clears his throat and then he kisses her

of bring inadequate i mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way long pause
starting to dress dont move
he slams the bathroom door shut
the light in the room disappears
the midsummer sun beats down on the braddock swimming pool and on ben who lies on a rubber raft in the middle of the pool
ben wears dark glasses is deeply tanned and holds a beer can in one hand
sounds teenagers yelling and swimming in nearby pools a radio playing rock and roll a television set tuned to a ball game
sound of the back door closing
ben opens his eyes and moves his head slightly
braddock is passionately stoking a barbeque fire
braddock is going toward him from the house carrying some ominously large thing wrapped in tinfoil
he rolls off the raft and swims to the end of the pool
he climbs out walks to the back door takes his shirt from a chair and starts to put it on as he opens the back door and goes through
ben has just shut the door to the bathroom behind him
he is wearing his shirt buttoned and no trousers
pan with ben as he walks across the room past mrs
robinson who is standing in front of the bureau taking off her brace let and watch
he moves to a chair and sits
he picks up a cigarette from an ashtray on a table next to the chair
robinson moves in to ben kneels in front of him and starts to unbutton his shirt
he takes the cigarette out of his mouth
we now see behind ben the door that leads from the braddock den in which ben is sitting
in the dining room mr
braddock are sitting having their dinner looking through the doorways toward ben
ben stands crosses back to the door to the den and shuts it
on bens back as he returns to the chair and sits
a television set facing the chair is on
ben picks up a can of beer and drinks from it
an animated cartoon is playing on the television set
ben watches it
bens face watching
push in to closeup of his face
closeup of television set and cartoon
closeup test pattern
closeup ben watching
pull back and we are in the taft hotel room
ben is sitting on the bed leaning against the headboard watching the television set which is on a stand facing the bed
sound of the hum of the test pattern
pull back to a wide shot of the room lit only by the light from the television set
robinson walks into the shot half dressed
she passes between ben and the television set and goes out of frame
ben continues to stare at the set
sound of a zipper being pulled up
robinson appears again and passes the other way
sound of bracelets being put on
robinson passes back the other way again
sound of clothing being put on and a purse being snapped closed
robinson now fully dressed and carrying her purse passes through again and without looking at ben goes to the door of the hotel room opens it and exits
sound of door closing
follow ben as he gets up and moves to the windows of what is now his bedroom in the braddock house
he opens the closed blinds over the window
the sun is bright outside
his bathing suit is on the window sill
he takes the suit and puts it on
he moves to the bedroom door opens it and goes out
we see mrs
braddock in the kitchen
ben comes through the back door moves to the pool and dives in
the raft floats in the center of the pool
ben swims toward us the length of the pool
ben surfaces and in one movememt pulls himself up on the raft and lands on top of mrs
robinson on the bed
he stays on top of her for a moment
ben what are you doing
ben turns toward us and looks
braddock standing by the side of the pool
the sun is behind him
well i would say that im just drifting
here in the pool
well its very comfortable just to drift here
have you thought about graduate school
would you mind telling me then what were those four years of college for
what was the point of all that hard work
you got me
trying unsuccessfully to control himself now listen ben
i think its a very good thing that a young man after hes done some very good work should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself and lie around
and drink beer and so on
but after a few weeks i believe that person would want to take some stock in him self and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass
braddock steps in beside mr
the robinsons are here
robinson steps in beside the others
they blot out the sun
what are you doing with yourself these days
oh not too much
taking it easy
thats what id do if i could
nothing wrong with that
hey ben elaines coming down from berkeley soon
i want you to call her up this time
because i just think you two would hit it off real well together
robinson steps in beside them
a long pause say hello to mrs
ben halfway dressed to go out in slacks shirt and tie sits in a chair
the door opens and mrs
can i talk to you a minute
im going to ask you something but you dont have to tell me if you dont want
well im going to ask you what you do when you go off at night
when i go off
you dont have to tell me if you dont want
no i do
i want to tell you
there is a pause
i drive around
well you dont drive around from midnight until noon the next day benjamin
then what do you do
do you meet someone
why did you say that
well this is your business benjamin
she starts toward the door if you no wait
i dont meet anyone mother but why did you say that
benjamin im not going to pry into your affairs but id rather you didnt say anything at all than be dishonest
she looks at him
you think im being dishonest
well why do you why do you think that
because i know you dont drive around for twelve hours
well i dont
shall i tell you what i do
not if you dont want to
but i dont want you to make up something
but im im not very proud of what i do
i usually get kind of drunk
i usually drive over to los angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk
then i take a hotel room
so i wont have to drive home on the freeway
i mean it kind of scares me to drive home after goodnight benjamin
you believe me dont you
she shakes her head
but i want you to
please will you believe me
she exits goodnight
wait a minute
robinsons hands are undoing his necktie
ben is dressed as in previous scene plus a jacket
wait a minute
he pushes her hand away sit down a minute
robinson looks at him and raises her eyebrows
will you please sit down a minute
robinson walks to the bed and sits
she reaches down to take off a shoe
will you leave that shoe on for a minute
she straightens up
now do you think we could say a few words to each other first this time
if you want
i mean are we dead or something
well i just dont think we have much to say to each other
all we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together
are you tired of it
but do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then
well what do you want to talk about
anything at all
do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences
oh my god
if thats the best we can do lets just get the god damn clothes off and she reaches for her shoe
leave it on
now we are going to do this thing
we are going to have a conversation
think of another topic
how about art
thats a good subject
you start it off
you start it off
i dont know anything about it
yes i do
i know quite a bit about it
go ahead then
well what do you want to know about it
are you interested more in modern art or more in classical art
youre not interested in art
then why do you want to talk about it
ben nods and looks at the rug
can i take off my clothes now
think of another topic
tell me what you did today
do you really want me to
yes i do
i got up
ben starts shaking his head
do you want to hear it or not
but you might try and spice it up with a little originality
i got up
i ate breakfast and went shopping
during the after noon i read a novel
what novel did you read
i dont remember
then i fixed supper for my husband and waited until there
theres something we could have a conversation about
i mean everything
i dont know anything about how you how you work this
i dont know how you get out of the house at night
i dont know the risk involved
there isnt any
theres no risk
she shakes her head
how do you get out of the house
i walk out
you walk right out the door
what do you say to him
benjamin this isnt a very interesting topic
now tell me
how do you know he wont wake up sometime and follow you
because he takes sleeping pills
he takes three sleeping pills every night at ten oclock
but what about the noise from the car
what if the driveways on my side of the house
smiling were talking
were talking mrs
calm down benjamin
now lets keep going here
can i undress and talk at the same time
you say the driveways on your side of the house
so i guess you dont sleep in the same room
so you dont i mean i dont like to seem like im prying but i guess you dont sleep together or anything
no we dont
well how long has this been going on
looking at the ceiling for a moment about five years
are you kidding me
you have not slept with your husband for five years
now and then
he geats drunk a few times a year
how many times a year
on new years eve
sometimes on his birthday
man is this interesting
so you dont love him
you wouldnt say you weve talked enough benjamin
wait a minute
so you wouldnt say you loved him
but you dont hate him
i dont hate him
unhook my blouse
unhooking her blouse well how do you feel about him then
well thats kind of a bad situation then isnt it
i mean it doesnt sound like it could be much worse
if you hated him at least youd hate him
she nods and takes off her blouse
well you loved him once i assume
when you first knew him
i never did benjamin
now lets well wait a minute
you married him
why did you do that
taking off her stockings see if you can guess
well i cant
think real hard benjamin
i cant see why you did unless you didnt have to marry him or anything did you
dont tell elaine
you had to marry him because you got pregnant
are you shocked
well i never thought of you and mr
robinson as the kind of people who
now lets get to bed
wait a minute
wait a minute
so how did it happen
i mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances
was he a law student at the time
and you were a student also
what was your major
why are you asking me all this
because im interested mrs
now what was your major subject at college
but i thought you i guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then
well how did it happen
how do you think
i mean did he take you up to his room with him
did you go to a hotel
benjamin what does it possibly matter
wed go to his car
in the car you did it
i dont think we were the first
ben thinks for a moment
what kind of car was it
do you remember the make of the car
oh my god
i want to know
it was a ford benjamin
jumping up a ford
goddamnit a ford
so old elaine robinson got started in a ford
there is a pause
dont talk about elaine
dont talk about elaine
because i dont want you to
she walks to the bed
well why dont you
she pulls the bedspread down
ben begins to remove his jacket
i wish youd tell me
theres nothing to tell
well why is she a big taboo subject all of a sudden
robinson uncovers one of the pillows
well i guess ill have to ask her out on a date and find out whats benjamin dont you ever take that girl out
ben looks at her
do you understand that
i have no intention of taking her out
i was just kidding around
but why shouldnt i
i have my reasons
then lets hear them
lets hear your reasons mrs
because i think i know what they are
she pulls the covers down
im not good enough for her to associate with am i
im not good enough to even talk about her am i
lets drop it
were not dropping it
now thats the reason isnt it
im a dirty degenerate arent i
im not fit to benjamin
im good enough for you but im too slimy to associate with your daughter
thats it isnt it
you go to hell
you go straight to hell mrs
do you think im proud of myself
do you think im proud of this
i wouldnt know
well im not
i am not proud that i spend my time with a broken down alcoholic
and if you think i come here for any reason besides pure boredom then youre all wrong
robinson this is the sickest most perverted thing that ever happened to me
and you do what you want but im getting the hell out
youre goddamn right i am
he starts putting on his shirt
she sits on the edge of the bed and watches him
thats how you feel about me
that im a sick and disgusting person
now dont start this
dont start acting hurt
dont you expect me to be a little hurt
robinson you stand there and tell me im not good enough for your daughter
did i say that
of course you did
she shakes her head
benjamin i want to apologize to you if thats the impression you got
well two minutes ago you told me i wasnt good enough for your daughter
now you say youre sorry i got that impression
i didnt mean it
i dont think youd be right for each other
but i would never say you werent as good a person as she is
of course i wouldnt
robinson walks to the closet
what are you doing
well its pretty obvious you dont want me around any more
well look i was kind of upset there
im sorry i said those things
if thats how you feel but its not
smiling at him thats all right
i think i can understand why im disgusting to you
look i like you
i wouldnt keep coming here if i didnt like you
but if its sickening for you its not
i enjoy it
i look forward to it
its the one thing i have to look forward to
you dont have to say that
well i wouldnt
i would never say it if it wasnt true
may i stay then
i want you to
well dont thank me because i want you to
there is a long pause
but you wont ever take out elaine will you
i want you to promise me that
there is another long pause
why the hell did you bring this up
it never occured to me to take her out
then give me your word you wont
this is absurd
promise me benjamin
all right for christs sake
i promise i will never take out elaine robinson
pause benjamin lets not talk about it
lets not talk at all
at opposite sides of the room without looking at each other they begin to take off their clothes
ben sits at the table eating his breakfast and looking at the back of a cereal box
braddock are there
elaines back from school
i think it might be a nice gesture if you asked her out
benjamin looks at his father for a moment then continues eating and reading
ben is lying on his bed
braddock stands in the doorway
dont you think that shes a terribly attractive girl
because i think shes one of the prettiest girls ive ever seen
ben gives a small whimper
ben is lying face down on his raft in the middle of the braddock pool
the sun shines down
his diving mask is on over his eyes
his face is in the water looking down at the bottom of the pool
braddock in their bathing suits are in the pool paddling around ben
during the entire conversation they continue to swim around and around the raft trying to talk and keep their heads above the surface
its pretty embarrassing
i really dont know what to tell mr
its ackward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up elaine
next time he suggests it ill tell him i have no intention of ever calling her up in my life
i guess shes not good enough for you is that it
look elaine robinson and i do not get along
how do you know
you havent seen her since high school
i guess your evenings whatever you do with them are just too valuable
that has nothing to do with it i guess ill just tell mr
robinson that youre just too busy every evening doing god knows what dont go on like this
now if benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out i do
then ill simply invite all the robinsons over for dinner on thursday
he slides off the raft and goes underwater
his hair streaming up his eyes open
the dining room is one tenth its normal size
at a table for two are seated jammed in against each other the three robinsons and the three braddocks
elaines back is to us
ben is at the other end of the table facing us
the robinsons and braddocks sit along the sides
robinson is next to ben everyone is eating looking down at their places
after a few moments ben throws his head back ans starts to scream
as he continues to scream everyone looks at him except mrs
robinson who continues to eat calmly without looking up
ben surfaces and pulls himself up on the side of the pool
ill go call elaine now
braddock cling exhausted to the raft and try to smile at each other
sound ding dong of the robinson door chimes
the door opens
robinson stands there with a huge smile
well braddock its about time you got around to this
come on in
im afraid the young lady isnt quite ready yet mr
robinson turns toward the sunroom
robinson is sitting there
what would you say to a short one
bourbon still your drink
robinson hands him drink
ill see if shes ready
note following dialogue played simultaneously now listen this was not from hall my idea
it was my fathers hey there she is
america thats who it is
its definitely miss america
benjamin i thought i made elaines voice myself perfectly clear about daddy can you fix this
the clasp is broken i think
whispering urgently ill do it ill do it
look well go out to dinner and have a drink and ill elaines voice bring her back
because it is ben here
was either that or a dinner party for the two families
robinsons voice and im afriad i couldnt hes in the living room having quite handle that if you a chat with your mother
i have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life
so dont get upset about it
but i am
im extremely upset about it benjamin
robinson and elaine enter
well i want you to keep your wits about you tonight
you never know what tricks ben picked up back there in the east
shot ben and elaine in bens car
from the back
ben leans forward slightly pushing the car recklessly in and out of the traffic
ben is wearing dark glasses
youre living at home now
is that right
do you know what youre going to do
are you going to graduate school
he leans on the horn
the car directly ahead of him does not move to the right
ben jerks his car over to the right swerves around the car ahead jamming his horn down and swerves back into the outside lane giving the driver of the other
car an angry look as he passes him
elaine holds on to the dashboard to keep her balance
do you always drive like this
a drab almost deserted room with formally dressed waiters
ben and elaine are seated at a table
do you want some dinner
id love some
a waiter moves forward toward them
bring a menu
dinner for two sir
just for her
the waiter moves away
arent you eating
if its all right with you im not hungry
the waiter returns with a menu
ive changed my mind
ben and elaine walking on the strip
ben pushes through the people crowded in around the entrance
without turning around he waits for elaine who has difficulty following him
as she gets to him he starts forward again
he starts up the stairs
elaine is just behind him
seedy ugly three quarters filled
a tuxedoed hood leads them through the tables to a table directly under the stage on which a stripper is in the process of removing her dress
there is one chair facing the stage the other with its back to and up against the stage
ben sits down in the chair facing the stage
elaine stands for a moment unsure
elaine sits in the chair with her back to the stage
she folds her hands on the table and looks down at them
ben takes a pair of dark glasses out of his pocket and puts them on
the two chairs are slightly angled toward each other so that ben can look up at the stage without looking directly at elaine
why dont you watch the show
the stripper is reflected in bens glasses
benjamin do you dislike me for some reason
no why should i
i dont know
she is down to a tasseled bra and g string
she is twirling the tassels
youre missing a great effect here
elaine turns around looks at the stripper and turns back
how do you like that
elaine doesnt answer
could you do it
the stripper sees elaine look
the stripper smiles toward ben and walks toward his table twirling the tassels as she walks
ben smiles as he watches her approaching
the stripper moves directly behind elaines chair
the spotlight from the back of the house falls into elaines face
as it does elaine puts her hand up to shield her eyes
the stripper slides a finger into her mouth wets it and holds it up in the air
the music stops and a drum roll starts
the stripper bends over elaines head and begins swinging the tassels so that they rotate in front of elaines face
he leans forward slightly to watch the action
the swinging tassels are reflected in his glasses
the drum roll gets louder and faster
the tassels swing more frantically
she pulls her hand down from in front of her eyes
with elaines face reflected in his glasses
through bens glasses
elaines face seen darkly but fully for the first time
the tassels swing in front of it
tears start out of her eyes
he reaches up to remove the glasses
as the glasses come off and her face is seen in the harsh spill from the spotlight
the tears are running down her face
only her eyes are crying as she looks straight at ben
with his glasses off he watches her
he reaches forward and puts his hand in the way of the tassels
some of the customers start to boo
ben rises takes elaines arm and leads her toward the exit
the entrance to the strip joint
elaine runs to the bottom of the steps
the sunset strip sidewalk outside is crowded with people moving back and forth
ben follows her
she pushes through the crowd on the sidewalk
ben catches her and holds her arm
elaine im sorry
elaine leans against the side of the building and pulls her arm away
will you take me home now
im sorry i took you in there
i think id better go home now please
but elaine where is the car
i just want to tell you something
ben facing her keeps moving from side to side trying to get her to look at him
she keeps looking away
i want to go home
but could i just tell you this one thing
this whole idea this date and everything
it was my parents idea
they forced me into it
oh thats very nice of you to tell me
what i mean is thats why ive been acting this way
im not like this
i hate myself like this
she starts to cry
people on the sidewalk are looking at them
she turns away from them
ben moves away from them
ben moves around in front of her
listen could you stop crying please
no i couldnt
but could you try
she brings both hands up to her face
ben looks at her for a few moments in agony
then very determined he takes her wrists in his hands and pulls them away from her face
she looks up startled
she starts to give a little cry but before she can he is kissing her
she closes her eyes
he brings his fists containing her hands up to the side of her face
he opens his hands against her face freeing her hands
her hands move slowly to his wrists and hang on
after a while she pulls away turning her head slightly to one side
elaine he starts to pull her head back
ben and elaine are sitting in the car in a drive in restaurant
there are trays hooked onto windows along side of both of them
they are eating and drinking furiously
ive had this feeling ever since ive graduated this kind of compulsion that i have to be rude all the time
do you know what i mean
yes i do
he looks at her
its like ive been playing some kind of game but the rules dont make any sense to me she is watching him carefully
theyre being made up by all the wrong people no i mean no one makes them up they seem to have made themselves up
a car with a couple of teenagers has driven up in the slot on their right
its radio is tuned into a rock and roll station and it is playing loudly
ben leans across elaine and speaks through the window to the kid behind the wheel
say i wonder if i could request you to turn that down a little
the kid turns the radio up
ben and elaine roll their windows up
from outside of car
ben is talking with great animation elaine is watching him
they are both eating as ben talks telling elaine a story
their windows are rolled up
sounds cars gunning their engines horns honking radios playing waitresses yelling orders customers yelling at waitresses kids laughing and talking from car to car motorcycles driving in and out traffic
the car coasts silently to a stop in front of the robinson house
the radio plays quietly
ben turns it off
they sit there for a long time without saying anything bens hand touching her shoulder
it is very quiet
well maybe id better go in
they continue to sit there for another long moment
would you like to come in
i could make some coffee
no i mean i wouldnt want to wake anyone up
lets go inside
wait a minute
is anything wrong
no i was just thinking look its still early we could do something go somewhere else
he starts the car immediately and drives away from the house
ben is driving
where we going
im trying to think of where theres a place to have a drink around here
isnt there one in the taft hotel
there is a squeal of tires as ben almost drives off the road
what is the matter
im just wondering if they have a bar or not
i mean lets go see
lets go see if they do or not
ben and elaine enter the lobby and stand just inside the door
they start in a few steps
listen elaine it seems to me that there isnt a bar in here
i mean as far as i know
of course there is
look the veranda room right there
one of the car parkers passes them on his way out
camers begins to pull up and away
a bellboy passes them
hello how are you sir
the room clerk smiles at them
good evening mr
ben and elaine stop a few feet into the center of the lobby
the camera pulls back to a high overhead shot revealing many people moving back and forth in the lobby passing ben and elaine
how are you this evening
benjamin lets get out of here elaine
lets go somewhere else
benjamin do they know you
of course not
good evening sir
gladstone how are you
he moves her toward the door

ben brings elaine through the door to the porch
ben whats happening

they must think i look like this guy gladstone
pan with them as they start down the steps
coming up the steps toward them is miss dewitte on the arm of another elderly lady
miss dewitte hello mr
sound car starting noisily
ben and elaine in his car
he takes his hand off the ignition jams on the accelerator and drives the car speedily for twenty one feet and jams on the brakes
he turns off the ignition and the lights
he puts his head down on the steering wheel
he lifts his head
elaine i like you
i like you so much
do you believe that
youre the first youre the first thing for so long that ive liked
the first person i could stand to be with
she takes his hand
i mean my whole life is such a waste
its just nothing
ill take you home now
he turns the key in the ignition and starts the car
benjamin are having an affair with someone
he freezes with his hand still on the key
he turns off the engine
that is not my business
it just happened
it was just this thing that happened along with everything else
can you understand that
was she married or something
with a family
she had a husband and a son
did they ever find out
and its all over now
he starts the car and drives out
can we do something tomorrow
during the day
well go for a drive or something
you sure you really want to
because i wouldnt want you to do it unless you really wanted to
benjamin i really do
it is raining
on the seat beside ben is a package
from the way it is wrapped we can tell it is a gift
bens right hand is on it as he drives
the radio is playing
past ben and through the windsheild as the robinson house comes closer and closer
the front door of the robinson house opens and mrs
robinson comes out dressed in a housecoat and in four or five fast steps reaches the car opens the door on the passengers side and climbs in
ben moves the package over into his lap
drive down the block
robinson i have a date with elaine
were going for a drive
looking at him for the first time do exactly what i say
ben starts the car forward down the driveway
as they drive
now it seems to me listen to me very carefully benjamin
you are not to see elaine again
those are my orders
is that clear
ben stops the car in front of a house halfway down the block
robinson i can makes things quite unpleasant
in order to keep elaine away from you i am prepared to tell her everything
i dont believe you
then youd better start believing me
robinson dont wreck it
im asking you please not to wreck it
go home now
i just dont believe you would do that
robinson looks at him for a moment
there is a pause while ben looks at her expression
then he grabs the keys out of the ignition opens the door on his side and jumps out of the car carrying the package
track with ben as he runs up the street and up the drive way toward the robinson house
ben gets to the front door
as he goes through the door elaine
ben runs in
im coming up
im not dressed yet
ben runs up the stairs
he still carries the package
ben gets to the top just as elaine comes out of the door to her bedroom
she is wearing a skirt and slip and carrying one shoe
benjamin i said i wasnt dressed ben pushes her back into her room
whats the matter
youve got to go over the back fence and ill meet you on the corner
benjamin whats happening
put your shoes on
ben turns and looks
robinson is just entering the house
he turns around
elaine is standing in the doorway watching him
she still holds the shoe in her hand
why arent you ready
because i want to know whats happening
sound of mrs
robinsons footsteps in the hall below
there isnt time
ben pulls elaine around behind the open door
they stand in the angle formed by the door and the wall as though they are hiding from someone
robinsons footsteps can be heard coming up the stairs
elaine i have to tell you something
he holds her against the wall in the corner
what is it
that woman what
the older woman
you mean the one who yes
the married woman it wasnt just some woman mrs
robinsons footsteps can be heard coming down the hall
what are you telling me
the footsteps stop
back in the corner
robinsons face appears in the crack in the door at elaines shoulder
elaine looks from bens face to the crack through which she can see her mothers eyes staring
please will somebody tell me she looks back at ben then back at her mothers face again
robinsons eyes watch her through the crack in the door
elaine looks away
ben backs up
elaine oh my god moving along the wall as though to keep as far from ben as possible elaine moves away from the door
elaine walks a few steps toward the other side of the room then turns back toward ben
the tears are starting out of her eyes
no dont cry dont cry
holds the package out to her get out of here
she moves toward him as though to hit him
he backs into the hall
elaine slams the door shut
holding the door get out
robinson stands at the end of it looking at ben
calmly goodbye benjamin
he looks at her in horror
he starts to back down the hall toward the stairs holding the package against his chest
she is standing there perfectly calm
she gets further and further away as though it is a very long hall in a very bad dream
ben sits cross legged on his bed in the dark his back against the fishtank smoking
ben drives by in his car
he looks at the house
ben dressed differently stands by the window overlooking the backyard
over his shoulder we can see mr
braddock down by the pool dressed in a sweater cleaning the pool with a long handled scoop
braddock looks up at bens window
ben moves aside
ben is standing behind a tree watching the robinson house
in the driveway of the robinson house elaine is getting into the robinson car
robinson is putting elaines luggage into the car
robinson stands at the door
robinson gets into the car and starts it
the car drives down the driveway and down the street
ben dressed differently again sits in a chair by his desk
he is writing
on the piece of paper is written dear elaine elaine elaine elaine and her name several dozen times
he stops and looks up
it is early morning
we see a swinging door pushed open to reveal mr
braddock dressed in a bathrobe standing at the kitchen counter by the window through which we can see an orange tree
braddock is pouring orange juice from a minute maid container
ben stands inside door

well well well he almost giggles as he crosses to ben and takes his hand to shake it
braddock appears in the doorway
ben is shaking his fathers hand
ben says he and elaine are getting married
i dont believe it
that what he says

ben this whole idea sounds pretty half baked
no its not
its completely baked
its a decision ive made
but what makes you think she wants to marry you
ben picks up his suitcase walks to the door and turns
to be perfectly honest she doesnt like me
ben driving his car left to right over dear elaine i am now visiting berkeley after growing somewhat weary of family life
i have been meaning to stop by and pay my respects but am not entirely certain just how you feel about seeing me after the incident involving myself and your
it was certainly a serious mistake on my part but not serious enough
i hope the last part runs down like a record on an old gramaphone
ben driving his car left to right over mr
robinson take great pleasure in announcing the wedding of their daughter
it runs down
bens car is being gassed up
it is a huge gas station with dozens of pumps and many neon lights
ben runs to a series of vending machines
he pushes quarters into them receiving cigarettes a sandwich an apple a cup of coffee
balancing them all carefully he runs back to the car climbs in puts his purchases on top of the dashboard hands the attendant a bill and drives off
ben driving left to right and eating
over honey im home
over hi sweetheart
over where are the kids
over oh theyre having a wonderful time spending the day at mothers shes teaching them to
it runs down
ben driving left to right over dear mom and dad
you may have wondered why elaine and i havent written in such a long time but the postal sytem here in greenland isnt the most efficient
life among these wonderful natives
it runs down
ben driving left to right over do you benjamin braddock take this woman mrs
robinson for your mother in law to love cherish and
it runs down
ben barely stops as he hands the change out the window of the low slung sports car and up to the toll taker
ben driving over bridge left to right over benjamin you and elaine have made such a wonderful marriage
i often laugh when i remember those nights at the taft
over yes how long ago that all seems
over chuckling ill never forget how peeved i was when i first
it runs down
pan the car past us and hold on it as it disappears in the distance
close on ben as he comes through the door
move with him as he wanders around the the commons room which is filled with students
girls singing couples necking a man with a heavy knapsack
ben walks to a lady receptionist no
who sits at a reception desk
may i help you
too loudly elaine robinson
clearing his throat elaine robinson
does she live here
the receptionist runs her pencil along a list of names under the glass top of her desk
she finds it
three oh eight

the receptionists hand moves to the receiver of a phone on the desk
ben looks at her hand for several seconds
he takes a step backward
her hand starts to lift the receiver
ben moves backward puts his hand up as though to stop her and shakes his head speechlessly
looking at ben
move with him as he moves past the students toward the door
pan around campus in a circle ending on a closeup of ben standing in the middle of the deserted campus looking around lost
mccleery from the bottom of the stairway shooting up
mccleery is the landlord of the rooming house
they are climbing a flight of stairs mr
mccleery first then ben carrying his suitcase
mccleery you a student
mccleery stops and turns
ben almost runs into him
mccleery whats that

mccleery takes a couple of steps up ben following and stops again
mccleery i like to know whos living in my house

mccleery just looks up at him

mccleery takes a couple more steps and stops again
mccleery youre not one of those agitators
mccleery one of those outside agitators
oh no sir
mccleery i hate that
i wont stand for it
he looks at ben searchingly then turns and continues up the stairs and down the hall
pan the room in a circle seeing a sink in one corner a bed a bureau a table a lamp a chair a window that overlooks a berkeley street ending
in a closeup of ben standing in the middle of it looking lost
the campus is empty except for ben who dressed carefully in his black suit sits on a bench in the quadrangle outside of wendell hall
during which ben remains static while the quadrangle and thet area around him fill up with students walking talking hurrying to class strolling sitting reading handing out petitions etc
elaine comes out
she walks carrying her books in bens direction
he sees her and stiffens
approaching from the distance
as she walks she is joined by another girl with whom she converses as they walk
he takes a step forward
as they approach they are joined by a tall boy with a beard
he starts toward them falters straightens himself
they are getting quite near
suddenly they are joined by three african exchange students in tribal robes
they all greet each other and continue to walk toward us
he looks at the massed group moving toward him horror taking over his face
he starts forward
as he passes elaine and her friends he seems to take a deep breath and hold it
she stops and slowly turns to look in his direction
her companions also stop
ben changes his direction and makes a circle to his left as though he has just changed his mind
he looks at her
he does not stop walking
he makes a slow circle around her as he speaks
hey what a surprise
not quite looking at her say i thought i remembered that you were going to school up here well well have to get together sometime ill be up here myself
for a little while
elaine and the others staring at him
it certainly has been nice i think im late yes i am he turns and walks away from them
they stand still watching them go
he starts to walk faster and faster
they watch him as he gets further and further away and then breaks into a run
he disappears in the distance
sound footsteps running a door opening and closing footsteps running upstairs a door opening and slamming
ben leans with his back against the closed door breathing heavily
ben following and watching elaine
ben is sitting at a table by the window through which we can see the street
he is drinking a beer
other tables are filled with students having animated discussions
ben starts to pour some beer from the bottle into the glass
he stops as he sees something through the window
he leans forward
elaine comes out of a bookstore across the street
she crosses the street and moves to a bus stop
he stands fumbles in his pocket for money puts a dollar on the table and rushes out
ben comes out of the door just as elaine gets into a bus and the doors close behind her
the bus starts off
ben runs after it
the bus gets to the next corner and stops for a red light
ben catches up with it runs to the front door and knocks on the door
the door opens and he climbs in
she is seated next to an older lady by the window immediately in front of the rear exit door
she keeps looking out the window almost holding her breath as she hears getting closer as he moves past people toward her excuse me im sorry i wonder if i
could get by excuse me there is a pause and then immediately behind her cheerfully well how about this for a coincidence
bens face is right behind elaine between her and the older lady sitting next to her
ben is standing on the steps to the rear exit door
elaine continues to look out the window
leaning in a little i was wondering where you were headed
elaine doesnt answer
the lady sitting next to elaine takes a look at her turns around and looks at ben then looks at elaine again
im meeting someone
she doesnt answer
where are you meeting this person
at the zoo
they have a pretty good one here do they
ive never been to it
well i havent either
i might just ride out there with you
hold on them riding
ben and elaine are walking along in front of one of the outside animal cages
ben is walking a step or two behind elaine
he is darting glances to the right and left
is that him over there
where did he say he was going to meet you
i thought he said by the monkey house
benjamin i would like to know what youre doing here
well i have this very pleasant room on carter street and ive been getting to some classes but youre not enrolled
i just sit in
they dont seem to mind
theyve been very congenial about it
she looks at him and starts to shake her head
benjamin youre i dont know what to say youre maybe we could get together some time and talk about it
really incredible here he comes
ive got a real feeling that this is the fellow
a good looking young man is striding briskly toward them
it is carl smith
he certainly is a good walker
carl strides up to them
he takes the pipe out of his mouth and puts it in his pocket
he reaches out and takes elaines hands
am i late
we thought you said by the monkey house
carl frowns and looks up over elaines shoulder at ben
this is benjamin braddock
benjamin rode here with me on the bus
glad to meet you ben
ben steps forward and grasps carls hand
great meeting you carl
carl steps back and puts an arm around elaines shoulder
the three of them look at each other for a moment
swell seeing you
have a good time
ben turns and starts walking back the way he came
carl and elaine turn and go in the opposite direction
ben stops after a few steps and walks over to one of the cages
he grips the rail with his hand and looks back at walking away his arm over her shoulder his other hand gesturing with the pipe in it as he talks
as he watches them go
his artificial smile disappears
the agony is such that he has to steady himself with his hand on the rail
he turns his face away toward the cage
there is an animal in it staring at ben
they look at each other
there is a box an automatic device with a recorded desciption of the animal that begins to deliver its recorded message
ben is standing by the window looking out
elaine is walking up the street toward the rooming house
he jumps to the other side of the window and peers out carefully
elaine turns in and disappears into the rooming house front door below
he runs to the bed and puts the covers back into place
he goes to the window sill picks up an empty beer can crosses to the bureau opens a bureau drawer
he crosses to the wastepaper basket under the sink bends down and takes a newspaper out of it
he crosses to the chair and sits down
he holds the newspaper in front of him
it is hopelessly crumpled
he gets up crosses to the bureau opens a drawer and takes out a traveling iron
he kneels down puts the newspaper on the floor and tires to straighten it out with the iron
there is a knock on the door
he rises puts the iron back in the drawer as quietly and quickly as he can then back to the chair sits down and holds the newspaper on his lap
there is another knock
ben crosses to the door and opens it
elaine is standing in the hall
i want to ask you a question

ben pushes her down softly onto the bed
he kneels along side her
ben sits next to her and puts his hand on her shoulder
she said she was having a drink in the hotel with a friend
you waited for her in the parking lot and told her she was too drunk to drive home and that you would get her a room for the night
then you took her upstairs and you raped her
elaine that is not what happened
she puts her hands on his shoulder

suddenly there she was without any clothes on i mean really naked ben is almost lying on top of her
elaine screams a long loud scream
ben looks at her
he leaps off the bed and runs to the sink
he fills a glass with water and brings it to elaine
he starts toward the door
sound of footesteps on the stairway and in the hall
ben goes to the closet opens the door takes a jacket from a hanger and puts it on

the footsteps and whistling get nearer and stop
hands come in and pick up telegram open the envelope and unfold the telegram reads pan up to ben
he crumples the telegram in his hand
close up one bens hand fiddling with the crumpled telegram
students are moving quickly from building to building
ben is walking alongside elaine

they move up the steps of a classroom building
ben pushes through a lot of students to keep up with elaine
they walk down a corridor
on each side are open doors to classrooms with students filing into each of them
i just dont think it would work
why wouldnt it
a bell rings
elaine turns into one of the doors
ben is left in the hall
he looks around
all the doors in the classrooms close
he leans against the wall
standing poised by the door
the bell rings
the classroom doors open and students start to file out
elaine comes out of the classroom
why wouldnt it
i just dont think it would
elaine starts walking down the corridor towards the exit door
ben follows her moving out of the way of the other students
elaine and twenty other girls are in basketball uniforms
two teams of girls are playing basketball
elaine sits on the bench watching
ben stands behind her
the girls are shouting and clapping and jumping up and down
tomorrow then can we get our blood tests tomorrow morning
she turns and looks at him
why dont you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much

elaine jumps up applauding a shot
hes a medical student
weve known him for years
who that guy at the zoo
why do you have to see him
well i said i might marry him
elaine and several other girls run onto the court as a number of girls run off the court to the bench
yelling after her you what
ben is seated across a study table from elaine
there are many other students scattered around the room
how did he do it
did he get down on his knees
he didnt get down on his knees i hope
well what did he say
he said he thought wed make a pretty good team

where did he do it
she starts to get up
id like to know where it happened
she starts to move away
it wasnt in his car was it
ben and elaine are standing at the entrance

the day after tomorrow
maybe we are and maybe we arent
she goes through the doorway into wendell hall
ben remains standing in exactly the same positin
after a few moments the door opens and elaine comes out steps quickly to ben kisses him then runs back inside
ben turns and starts away from the door
the door opens again
ben turns back and takes a step toward the door smiling expectantly
a tall bearded man comes out and goes past ben
ben breaks up
through the window of a hippy jewelry store we see a sales woman modeling a ring for ben
he nods she takes it off puts it in a box and gives it to him
he pays for it and exits past camera whistling
ben enters carrying four oddly shaped boxes and some flowers
ben is whistling happily as he runs up the stairs two at a time
he opens the door to his room and steps in
the room is dark
the figure of a man is silhouetted against the window
ben freezes just inside the door
there is a long pause
clearing his throat do you want do you want to try and tell me why you did it
do you have a special grudge against me
do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me
no its not is there something ive said thats caused this contempt
or is it just the things i stand for that you despise
it was nothing to do with you sir
well ben it was quite a bit to do with me
ben takes a step forward
now look please ben i think were two civilized human beings
do you think its necessary to threaten each other
i am not threatening you
do you want to unclench your fists please
i can see in the dark you know
ive been here quite a while
i am trying to tell you i have no personal feelings about you mr
i am trying to tell you i do not resent you
you dont respect me terribly much either do you
no i dont
well i dont think we have a whole lot to say to each other ben
i do think you should know the consequences of what youve done
i do think you should know that my wife and i are getting a divorce soon
it shouldnt make any difference what happened
thats quite a statement
listen to me
we got we got into bed with each other
but it was nothing
it was nothing at all
we might we might just as well have been shaking hands
well thats not saying much for my wife is it
you miss the point
dont shout at me ben
the point is i dont love your wife
i love your daughter sir
well im sure you think you do ben but after a few times in bed with elaine i feel quite sure youd get over that as quickly as you i
think ive talked about this enough
i dont know how far i can go ben
i dont know if i can prosecute or not but i think maybe i can
in the light of whats happened i think maybe i can get you behind bars if you ever look at my daughter again
i have seen elaine and i have spent the afternoon taking steps to insure
robinson climbs across the bed to get to the door
ben takes a step toward him
stay away from me ben
robinson stands at the door
i dont want to mince words with you
as far as elaines concerned youre to get her out of your filthy mind right now

youll pardon me if i dont shake hands with you
robinson opens the door and starts into the hall
i think you are filth
robinson turns back from the hall
i think you are scum
robinson starts down the stairs
mccleery is standing on the stairway listening
you are a degenerate
robinson turns and goes down the stairs past mr
mccleery who looks up at ben
he walks to the door looks out into the hall at mr
mccleery then shuts the door
ben goes to the window and looks out
on the street below mr
robinson getting into a cab

bens car is parked two blocks from the robinson house
ben has just left the car and is making his way to the robinson backyard
ben climbs a fence into the backyard and moves to the house
he looks up at elaines bedroom window
a whispered shout elaine elaine he picks up a pebble and throws it at the window
he moves to the back door takes off his shoes puts them into his jacket pockets tries the back door
it opens and he goes in
there are no lights
ben moves through the house into the hall and up the stairway
ben goes to the door of elaines room and looks in
there is a light on in the room and the sound of someone moving around
he goes in
as ben moves further into the room mrs
robinson carrying some of elaines clothes comes out of elaines closet and moves past ben
she does not stop but walks casually past him into the hall
ben follows her through the hall into mrs
where is she
robinson without stopping puts elaines clothes down next to a half packed open suitcase on her bed and moves to a telephone on the night table
she lifts the receiver and dials zero

sound of several cars turning into driveway
i dont think youll have time for that drink after all

i dont think so
the cars have reached the top of the driveway
sound of the squeal of brakes and car doors opening
ben dives head first into the hall scrambles to his feet and runs to the back of the house
ben comes through the back door runs to the back fence and vaults it
lights start to go on in the house behind him
ben driving rapidly
he jams on the brakes and stops the car in the middle of the street
cars honking move around him as he sits staring ahead
god damn it wedding
people are yelling as him from the cars going by
carl i think you and elaine will make a good team
your fathers right elaine

ben swings the car around in a u turn and speeds off in the other direction
ben driving rapidly left to right past the landmarks established on the previous drive to berkeley
we have two carl smiths

im afraid i dont know
the karl smith with a k teaches history of advertising and the other
the one with the c carl smith junior is in our medical school
he lives at gamma delta tau
ben pulls up in front of the gamma delta tau house
he gets out of the car
he is haggard tired and unshaven
the car is mud spattered
ben enters the hall
through a door can be seen a dozen or so fraternity brothers seated at a table chowing down
it is breakfast
ben walks into the dining room
the fraternity brothers are eating and talking noisily
say fellows they stop eating and turn toward him
do any of you fellows know where carl smith is
he took off in the middle of the night to get married
he goes back to his breakfast
proabaly one step ahead of the shotgun
do you happen to know where hes getting married
im supposed to be there
why dont you ask carter
would you happen to know where i might find him
hes probably still in the sack
hes always in the sack
they start to laugh
or in the can
they all laugh a great deal
ben gives a polite smile
a large steam filled room with a row of fraternity brothers in front of a row of sinks brushing combing shaving etc
ben is standing at the door

a great deal of laughter follows this gem
ben driving right to left
the laughter from the previous scene can still be heard for a moment
ben is exhausted looking
he opens the windows turns the radio on and rubs his eyes
the car moving speedily right to left south on the highway to santa barbara
shot the car leaving the freeway under a santa barbara sign
the car swings onto an off ramp and down to a street turns into a gas station and stops near the office
ben gets out of the car and runs into the office
the clock on the office wall reads
the gas station attendant is sitting reading a stock car magazine
do you have a phone
the attendant points
ben reaches for the phone book hanging under the pay phone
the front of it says santa barbara telephone directory
ben opens it to the ss
his finger runs down to the smiths
there is at least a half a page of them
bens finger runs up and down and stops at the name smith carl w
he inserts a dime and dials
the attendant watches him
sound of buzzing from the phone
it clicks open

smiths answering service

the attendant puts down his magazine and stares

he turns to the attendant
where is it
suspiciously six blocks up three blocks over
ben runs out of the office
the attendant goes to the door
getting into car
the attendant is in the b

im not a priest im a minister
the car drives out of the station
the car comes toward us through the traffic
it stops in the intersection to make the turn
sound the engine failing
ben looks down
the needle is on e
he pumps the gas pedal
it makes the turn and rolls to a stop by the curb
he jumps out of the car leaving the door open and starts to run down the street
he looks up ahead on the other side of the street
the first presbyterian church
running across the street
he stops for a moment and looks around
there are a number of cars parked in front of the church
among them is mrs
ben runs by it and up the steps to the front doors of the church
he pulls at the doors
they are locked
through the glass doors we can see to the front of the church where the wedding ceremony is taking place
running around the side of the church
there are glass windows and doors through which as he runs we can see the ceremony continuing
ben runs looking for an entrance
he goes all the way around the church and stops at a side door
he opens the door and goes in
the balcony is between two huge windows one of which looks out on the lawn outside the other looks into the interior of the church where the ceremony is taking
the sun is coming through the window
ben stops and looks through the inside window
the minister is just closing the book
he says something and carl and elaine kiss
oh jesus god no he puts his hands up against the glass and slumps
the minister shakes hands with carl then takes elaines hand
the organ music starts to thunder
he moves to the center of the window and begins to pound on the glass
bens shadow is thrown across the celebrants
they all turn around and look up at him
ben is like a trapped moth beating on the window and yelling soundlessly
she looks up at ben with a small triumphant smile
looking up at ben
looking up at ben
looking up at ben
she moves down the aisle toward him dazed
robinson carl and mrs
robinson are moving toward elaine
the organ is playing loudly
bens voice can be heard shouting elaines name
the pounding on the glass can be heard
who is that guy
whats he doing
ill take care of him
hes too late
the other guests are adlibbing their confusion
she turns back toward her mother father and carl as they come toward her
looking at them
all sound stops except for bens voice in the distance shouting elain elaine elaine
her face turning quickly to look up at ben
his face twisted with passion his body spread eagled against the glass
looking up at ben
the sound of the organ and the guests voices starts again
he starts to go back down the stairs
he reaches the bottom of the stairs and goes through a door which leads into the vestibule of the church
robinson is waiting for ben crouching his arms spread
behind him is elaine
ben moves toward them
robinson grabs ben around the waist
ben twists away
robinson grabs bens collar and tears his jacket half off
ben turns and hits mr
robinson in the face
robinson falls down
ben moves to elaine and grabs her hand
he pulls her toward the doors
come on dont faint
his back to the action clawing away at the organ obliviously
a man in clerical garb is guarding the door
ben and elaine move toward the door
out of my way
carl steps in and grabs ben from behind
ben breaks carls hold and picks up a gold cross off a nearby stand
he begins to swing it advancing toward carl
carl backs up toward the other guests
robinson steps to elaine
she reaches out and takes elaines wrist
elaine its too late
elaine pulls her hand away
not for me
he turns toward the man standing in front of the door and raises the cross over his head
the man moves away from the door
elaine steps forward and opens the door
she and ben go out
ben jams the cross through the handles of the door
he grabs elaines wrist
run elaine run
they start to run
elaine trips and falls
ben helps her up and they continue to run
from inside the church vestibule
through the glass doors we can see elaine and ben running down the street
the wedding party members are tugging furiously at the jammed doors
robinson turns toward us and calmly begins to put on her gloves
ben and elaine running along the sidewalk
ben holds her hand and is pulling her
she still holds her flowers
they run to a bus that is just closing its doors
he bangs on the closed door of the bus
the door opens
ben climbs the step into the bus and pulls elaine up after him
the doors close
ben holds out a dollar bill
where do you want to go
to the end
the driver takes the bill and gives ben some change
ben turns and pulls elaine along to the back of the bus
he pushes her into one of the seats and sits beside her
ben looks toward the front of the bus
he sees the driver and the passengers all turned around in their seats and looking back at them
lets get this bus moving
he turns and starts the bus
they are breathing heavily
she takes his hand
through the window in the back of the bus the church can be seen receding in the distance
there seem to be a number of men dressed in black running around in the street in front of it
