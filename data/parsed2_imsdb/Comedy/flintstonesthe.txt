de souza based on characters created by early draft september fred flintstone archetypical everyman sits atop his faithful heavy equipment dinosaur cranking the winch that makes the mighty beast rip
and tear into the quarry wall
looks down at his wristwatch
actually its a wrist sundial
and its magic time
now the foreman turns from his watch to a steam whistle bird and yanks its tail
the bird squawks the end of the workday fred happily discards his hard hat leaps out of the canvas roofed cab on the dinos back slides down the tail and
bounces right into the seat of his stone and timber car
he gets up to a running start with the only motor his feet slows to allow a time clock dinosaur to punch his stone timecard and then hes trotting back
up to speed and out of the gate
music comes up and flintstones meet the flintstones theyre a modern stone age fam i ly and so forth as for the first time in his tor y we see
the flintstones opening credits live
we widen as fred skids to a halt in the driveway of his three bedroom ranch cave
a moment later wilma and pebbles run out both looking just like they should and get into the car
a beat behind them are the flintstone pets dino and the saber toothed cat
fred pauses looks around
honks his horn
barney betty and bam bam come out of the neighboring house hop in
freds feet slap on the street as the car starts up from the town of bedrock theyre a page right out of his tor y fred and company pull in
he takes a giant sea shell speaker off of its wooden stand and hooks it to his car door
he leans over puts his arm around wilma
in the back seat dino pops his head up tearing through the canvas top
dino picks up pebbles and bam bam and puts them on his head for a better view
camera zooms in on the drive in screen and the words that america has waited twenty five years to see in mm dolby tm drop your popcorn reality and as
the main credits roll we dew drips from strange multi leafed plants
giant dragonflies buzz and hum to and fro
bubbles rise from a still pond and weird lungfish move onto the land
the third one out carries a little suitcase
camera pans past the lungfish to a muddy shore
with a dramatic musical sting we discover a set of strange hideous clawprints
the camera follows these then widens to reveal the make of these footprints a seven foot tall and fearful beast we will call the xenosaurus
it looks around menacingly
oddly its carrying a canvas sack but we dont stress this
suddenly a garbage truck appears out of nowhere and runs over the xenosaurus
dazed the xenosaurus gets up
as it does we realize that we arent deep in some primeval forest but on the shoulder of a gravel highway
a stone road sign reads exits
now the camera cranes up above the sign and we see bedrock
nestled incongruously in a savage landscape the charming protosuburbia gleams in the dawns early spielberg light
the xenosaurus grabs its sack and some silverware spills out
then it runs off into the bushes and out of sight
it reaches the crest of a hill where theres a welcome to bedrock billboard which bears greetings from the rotary club the chamber of commerce and of course the loyal
order of water buffaloes
the garbage truck guys drop their feet down through the floorboard and trot over the rise coast down to the street below
the driver yanks a wooden brake and the truck stops and the rear guys hop off
one of them waves to who returns the wave then takes a four pack of stone bottles out of his milk truck heads towards a doorway
as the milkman drops off the milk he passes a big tortoise with trash cans on its back
the tortoise nods familiarly to the milkman then it waddles down the curb camera following
the garbage men take the cans off the tortoises back dump them into the truck
revealing that the back of the truck is actually a giant jawed creature strapped onto the chassis
the garbage men dump the cans into its maw
it happily swallows the works licks its lips belches
the garbagemen slam the cans back on the tortoise who winces as they drive off
under his breath you can forget about a tip for christmas
it waddles back up the lawn
passing by a wooden lawn timer box which now pops open
inside the box is a roostersaurus which crows and flaps its wings
the motion of the wings knocks loose two round stones which roll down two long troughs a la rube goldberg
they reach the ends of their respective paths dislodging a stick
that releases a coiled rope which in turn spins a turntable which holds a little wooly mammoth
as it begins to spin around it squirts water out of its snout
elsewhere on the lawn other spinning mammoths repeat this performance
after a moment they gradually slow their revolutions
the one closest to the house scrunches its trunk with a groan
sotto oh my aching sinuses
widen from the windowsill where a little sea shell hearing aid trumpet amplifies another roostersaurus cock a doodle doo into the ear of a clock radio woodpecker
the woodpecker yawns gets out of bed puts a timecard in a little clock
then it turns and begins pecking on a bell which rings piercingly
two shapes are visible under the bedclothes one is a great snoring bulge the other is a svelte and lithe shape
as the bell continues ringing the larger bulge grunts moans pulls a pillow over its head and then finally gropes under the bed for a slipper
the slipper is thrown without aiming ducks just in time
it wipes its forehead nervously
sotto i hate this job
theres not even a health plan
he staggers back up to his perch and then notices for the first time that the dial on the side is pointed not to alarm but to alarm radio
the woodpecker sighs looks over at the bed where snoring is still emanating
then the bird swings a little telescope around to point out the window
as the scope pans and focuses finally settling on a distant stone building marked radio station b rok
perched on top of the wooden radio tower are a monkey and an octopus
the monkey holds up cue cards which the octopus reads and then waves nautical semaphore flags
our woodpecker squints clears his throat
deeper on air voice good morning bedrock
this is station b r o k with the morning weather and news
the big bulge grunts and mutters a bit then one hand gropes around finds the curvaceous form under the neighboring covers
feels it tentatively
then the fingers walk upwards
it will be fair and mild through the weekend continuing for the next eight hundred years followed by cooling breezes and a protracted ice age
those walking fingers have reached the top edge of the covers
now they pull them down revealing the owners face
the face of fred his eyes at half mast his face covered in fashionable bedrock vice stubble
with genuine charm wil ma
how about a great big good morning kiss for your freddy weddy
and he pulls the covers down to reveal dino who is immediately yi yi yi yi ing hopping all over the bed and showering fred with sloppy kisses
dino cut it out
in the news bedrock civic and business leaders met yesterday to discuss the growing kibble crisis
ecological activist ralph naderock warned that if new supplies of kibble are not found our animal powered civilization itself may be threatened
by now dinos affection attack has knocked both master and pet to the floor in a jumble of bedclothes asses and elbows
dino begins to roll fred across the room like a seal playing with a ball
dino thats enough here look daddy has a nice dino bone for you just please stop it fred has now backed up to a dresser where he grabs a brightly
colored box labeled purinrock dino treats
fred holds it up dino gets up on two legs eager for the treat fred shakes the box
alas nothing comes out
dino yi yis again propelling fred into the next room
five year old pebbles giggles at the table as fred and dino tumble into the room like frank buck and a lion
wilma turns at the noise
one look at her and we under stand freds romantic turn
in other news bedrock police report that the xenosaurus has struck again
yes the fiercesome intruder was sighted in the bedrock hills for the third time this month
outlying shops and residencies report extensive looting and property destruction
fred stop playing with dino and sit down
your breakfasts getting cold
saying this wilma puts a huge egg at freds place
meanwhile fred manages to get to his feet holds out one arm to keep dino at bay
fred does a big take looking out the window
throwing open the door oooh dino look theres a nice big dino bone laying out on the front lawn
dino gives him a big look as if to say oh yeah
trying again gosh look at that adorable little female dino yi yi yi yi dino is out the door like a rocket
fred cackles slams it shut then sits down at the table
that animals gonna kill me with kindness
do you know were out of dino treats
so is everybody else in bedrock
that kibble crisis is getting worse every day
she puts two giant slices of bread into a toaster
two claw like devices hold the toast pulling it out of sight
im afraid dinos going to have to manage on leftovers from pebbles and me
sitting down and whats wrong with my leftovers
ill let you know when i see some
finishing up scientists from b
university report that the footprints of the xenosaurus match no known animal
mommy is the bad ze ze zenosaurus gonna get me and eat me up
of course not baby
thats right sweetheart
the only thing thats gonna eat you up is me
and he grabs her and bites her and tickles her
giggling calming im still a little scared
pebbles dont worry
these stories are very exaggerated
like you know the boogyman
theres no such thing as a huge inhuman reptile that attacks without warning wham
dino reappears bounding through the window and knocking fred onto the floor
once again dino is happily licking and loving and cuddling his callously unresponsive owner
fred struggles to avoid the slurping tongue pulls himself up to the window sill looks out
oh look everybody the mailman is here yi yi yi yi
dino buys it again runs to the door lets himself out
this time fred puts a chair against the door
meanwhile wilma turns at the sound of the toaster popping up
we see that the claws we saw earlier were the actual claws of a lobster in a little fireproof suit who is tucked inside the toaster
as wilma takes the toast the lobster blows on his claws wincing then looks towards the camera
well it beats working in a seafood restaurant
taking the toast thanks wilma
fred slaps jelly on the toast takes a big bite and then something outside the window catches his eye
a paperboy on a wood and stone bicycle is coming rapidly towards the house
in the bikes basket is a stack of dried rock hard clay tablets
fred leans out the window waving his hands
dont aim at the house please not at the house wham
fred ducks back just as the stone newspaper slams into the window frame smashing a flowerpot taking out a chunk of wall and continuing diagonally through the kitchen and out
fred follows this action in time to see the rock paper drops like a foul shot rips through the canvas roof of freds car and then bangs a huge dent
in the hood
fred sighs turns back to his breakfast
lucky it wasnt the sunday paper
slight smile yeah
what else can go wrong
he slices through the big egg with his knife releasing a baby pterodactyl which squawks and flaps knocking fred over as it takes off through the window
fred now dressed for work is forlornly trying to fix his car
in the neighboring driveway wilma and betty pile the kids into bettys car
wiping their mouths come on kids
time for nursery school
bye bye daddy
bye little sweetheart
as wilma clears her throat bye big sweetheart
fred kisses them both and they drive off
fred sighs tries to stretch the canvas roof edges close enough to stitch
nearby dino struggles to drag the stone news paper inside the house
the twin headlines are of course kibble crisis grows and mysterious xenosaurus suddenly a pink flamingo appears over the hedge
as its mouth opens and closes it appears to be talking but the voice is that of nice morning huh fred
whats nice about it
that arnolds got a real arm on him dont he
now we see that barney is holding the flamingos stiff legs which he scissors making the birds beak trim the hedge
this is the third ragtop this year say shouldnt you be at work
ah well that appliance store and me we kinda had a little adjustment you got fired didnt ya
fred dont start on me again
i donno im just not a nine to five guy
i got dreams fred
ideas yeah i know i know those crazy inventions of yours
be honest with me barn
tell me one thing you invented that really caught on
i invented fire
pause you invented fire
i told you that fred
but the coal conglomerate ripped me off
the case is still in court but meanwhile i got lotsa other ideas yeah but did any one of them ever put bread on the table
how long are you and betty gonna live on those penny ante royalties you get
fred pulls his car hood off of its wooden hinges examines it with dismay
if you ask me pal youre just blowing smoke up your own volcano
he uses the flamingos jaws to snatch the car hood from freds surprised grasp
let me try some of that smoke on your car
we can still see freds car in the neighboring driveway
we can also see dino who drags the newspaper on a bit more then collapses from exhaustion
barneys garage is cluttered with all kinds of odds and ends plus various inventions and scale models in different stages of completion
interestingly a number of these anticipate leonardo da vincis work
many of the models are made of a strange celadon green material
fred watches skeptical as barney presses the car hood into some soft clay between two big blocks of stone
as he works see the first step we make a mold of the old car hood smooth out the dent in the clay he tosses the original car hood aside
with a crash
then moving rapidly he starts heaving a variety of ingredients into the reverse imprint of the car hood
add some lava granules
some woca leaves
juice from two coo coo berries
impressed two coo coo berries
you made of money barney
anything for a pal fred a lump of coal
a touch of the la brea tarbrush and voila
barney dips a finger in this mess tastes it satisfied he yanks on a hanging rope and a giant rock weight slams down on the whole mess making fred jump
out of his skin
fred is caked with dust
he coughs and spits
barney why dont you try inventing a brain for yourself
look at what you did to
he stops as barney cranks up the weight on a ratchet proudly lifts out a perfect though greenish duplicate of the car hood
as fred examines it impressed despite himself we
the two kids are in the back seat
somehow both of the kids faces are messy again
working together with beautiful precision they are carefully dismantling the rear armrests and door handles
in mid speech driving oh its not that im complaining wilma
i mean barneys sweet but
well hes just not cut out to punch a clock
and hes such a dreamer you think he ever once picked up a hammer and chisel and tried to balance a checkbook
they pull up in front of a pleasant looking simple little nursery school
granite a pleasant looking sees them from the schoolyard waves while wilma and betty un load the kids
no barney just keeps looking for that coo coo berry pie in the sky and i dont want to pop his balloon by talking about the price of mastodon ribs
she wipes off bam bams mouth with a handkerchief
wilma does the same with pebbles and then they kiss the kids who immediately run into the schoolyard
flintstone i wanted to thank you personally
youre welcome mrs
but we wipe their mouths every day
no no i mean for all your wonderful support the past few years
its parents like you that make me think twice about retiring
from the schoolyard comes the sudden sound of kids quar reling and then a thud and some crying
on the other hand
wilma and betty laugh
were really going to miss you too mrs
have you found another school for the children
were still shopping around
fortunately were both wilma and betty straighten
theyve done this routine before professional shoppers
as the three women laugh we
fred and barney drive along
behind them the same houses and palms seem to be going by
split level two palms
barney grins gestures towards the front of the car
not bad eh
after it cures for an hour or so its solid as a rock
okay you fixed a dented hood
but you call that a living
face it pal this is the stone age and its a dino eat dino world
you want my advice
did i ever
you stick with me today cruise on down to the quarry and fill out a job application
im a big man there barney youre a big man anywhere fred im serious pal
me and mr
slate are just like this he takes his hand off the wheel to hold up two fingers
ends up swerving instead
just like that
i know i know youre not a clock punching guy but face it barney its time to grow up and put your nose to the grindstone batten down the hatches
and join the ratasaurus race with the rest of us
meaningfully its time to retire those dreams
barney looks glum doesnt say anything
suddenly fred pulls over stops the car
theyre at the crest of a high wide hill
remember the old days barn
we used to race our go carts here to impress the girls
wistful yeah those were the days
we usta dream about coming back here some day with a real car and goin for the goldrock
a look from one to another and then down the hill
fred gets a malicious grin on his face
i thought you said it was time to retire those old dreams
since when do i have to be consistent
the two pals laugh and then with a whoop they begin pedalling like mad
they go over the top gravity takes over and they are flying past that billboard with all the rotary club welcomes on it
but now we see a different sort of welcome as a police car zooms out from behind it
inside are sergeant feldspar and his rookie partner officer gravel
cackling with anticipation feldspar opens a box marked radar detector
out pops a little bird in a police helmet
it has a stopwatch actually stop sundial around its neck
feldspar points the bird salutes takes off
spotting the cops oh oh
fred slow down
suddenly both fred and barney see the radar bird flying alongside them
it checks its stopwatch writes a note to itself
fred is so preoccupied he doesnt notice as cuts in front of fred
fred slams on the brakes sits helplessly as feldspar gets out walks over grinning
well flintstone looks like todays the day
sergeant feldspar i
i wasnt speeding
fred reaches down to the floorboard as he speaks
theres a box there marked radar buster
forget it flintstone
this time i got you dead to rights fred opens the box
a scary looking winged reptile sticks out its head smacks its hungry lips
confident feldspar jerks a thumb at the radar bird turns to his rookie partner
get me the radar reading and ill show you how we deal with scofflaws
gravel nods steps towards the bird
the bird checks its stopwatch
and then it notices the flying lizard which is hovering nearby licking its lips
wings do your stuff
the radar bird flies away at a hundred miles an hour leaving a cloud of dust and the stopwatch behind
feldspar catches the watch startled
well sergeant if you dont have a radar reading i guess well quickly justbeonourway
a new cloud of dust appears as fred roars away
flintstone come back here
betty and wilma have just pulled up
we notice that next to their legal spot a big limousine is parked in a no parking zone
but our law abiding betty in the next space now drops a stone coin in a parking meter
inside the window we see a little bird
it bites the coin to check it then turns over an egg timer
with a sigh four years in accounting school for this
its absolutely mobbed
customers push past each other with armloads of food
gigantic cuts of meat hang from above or are on display behind the counter
morris the butcher looks up from the chaos and manages a weak smile for the girls
morris what on earth is going on
you giving away bronto filets
ah my two loveliest customers
its this darn kibble crisis mrs
people are buying everything i got to feed their dinos
young man if youre through flirting id like some service
slate who stands there impatient and overdressed
of course mrs
just take a number
wilma senses the tension quickly steps forward to break it with a smile
ah hello mrs
morris reacts with relief
slate reacts with a blank look
prompting we met at the quarry picnic
oh of course
she turns her back to wilma forces her way towards the counter again
ladies the meats not getting any fresher
r whatll it be
oh id like some ground mammoth patties and uh
some dodo drumsticks
we got any dodo bird
gino turns looks at his end of the counter
theres one left and its the last one
handing him the note give it to mrs
rubble along with this
gino nods smiling
he picks up a crate begins to load it with giant fryer parts and several manhole sized meat patties
turning to betty how about you mrs
i just need a few things for fred
calling into the back david
get rob and bobo and tell em to bring the big dolly
flintstone again huh
you got it
pointing at the limo outside the shop youre in a no parking zone there
well if i get some service ill be out of it wont i
slate steps to the counter
meanwhile the staff begin using a refrigerator dolly to bring out giant ribs steaks and sausages which they pile up in front of wilma
i want a nice fresh juicy chickensaurus morris
and not one youve had laying around on the shelf
i mean fresh
slate were kind of busy now i dont care if youre busy
what i care about is my adorable little grand nephew
hes staying with me for the summer and i intend to make his favorite dish
southern fried chickensaurus
now i want a fresh chickensaurus and i want it now
boys you heard her
she said fresh
with a sigh they buckle on elbow and knee protectors go to a side door open it
inside is another barred door
they open it go inside
immediately we hear loud squawking and cackling
suddenly the barred door slams open and a giant chicken saurus comes bounding out with morriss staff hanging all over it like rodeo cowboys
they try and restrain it with ropes but its enraged and flops around the store
oblivious of the trouble morris while youre at it id like it plucked
suddenly the chickensaurus snaps the ropes flaps its wings and leaps through the front window the huge bird lands with a crunch atop mrs
slates car which is practically squashed flat
then it disappears around the corner
we hear car horns and skidding tires as it goes
wilma and betty try and hide their laughter
clouds of dust rise from behind the fence
we see the heads of the heavy equipment dinos rising and falling
a two story office building is at one end of the site with a big slate construction inc
sign on the roof
camera adjusts as freds car turns into the lot barney seated beside fred
the new green hood gleams in the morning light
fred digs his feet into the ground slams to a halt
he gets out surveys the activity
immediately the various workers shout ad lib greetings
fred acknowledges these beaming in the respect he gets here
he lovingly dusts off his construction helmet puts it on knocks an offending speck from his parking sign f
flintstone shop steward
he leads barney towards the quarry area
barney you wont regret this hiya al fixing dents in cars is one thing a careers another
here youre getting in on the ground floor of the first footstep of a new leaf hi wally hows the old backhand
and with a guy like me ta show you the ropes you can skip all the red tape all the malarky all the dino doo
fred stands near the weight station booth where a plump girl in a beehive hairdo sits inside a trailer
new york accent hi mr
this is my very special neighbor and pal barney rubble
he needs an application form okay
anything for you mr
she slams down two clay tablets and a stylus
here you go
smiling thanks again for the football tickets
my boyfriend and i both liked them
my pleasure shirl
but do you think next time we could go to the same game
confidently no problem
fred smiles at her hands the forms to barney
fres steps towards the quarry admires the activity hands on hips master of all he surveys
he waves to more friends
well barn what did i tell you
when youre in with flintstone youre in like flint
i knew you were a big shot
i just didnt know how big
fred beams at that and then follows barneys gaze to the read out on the truck scale
fred is standing on it and its pushing
with a scowl fred grabs barneys sleeve and they go into the quarry
as they move the camera pans and cranes up towards the window of the slate construction office
the room here is dominated by a tabletop architectural model of a large scale construction project
theres acres of little development houses then some tall office buildings a mall you name it theres even little foot powered model cars in the model parking spaces
near this we see mr
slate a giant in the bedrock con struction business but not in height
slate drinks coffee from a boss mug listens with growing impatience to jerry lava
several of slates lackeys listen their heads nodding up or down in sympathy with slates mer curial moods
uncle if youll look at this unit cost projection
it intersects here with howd you like my fist to intersect with your nose
ive told you a hundred times dont call me uncle in the office
now i didnt arrange your scholarship to harvrock university so you could waste my time
so stop beating around the bushasaurus and get to the bottom slime
youll be bankrupt in six months
slate does a danny thomas spit take all over the model
fred and barney cross the busy lot sidestepping workers and animals
fred does a lot of backslapping waving
barneys filling out the forms on the move
behind them we see the wide access ramp which spirals around the quarrys sides
to himself social security number
how learned of job newspaper ad carrier pigeon
writing personal reference
hearing a loud smash fred looks up and sees a burly and rough looking guy named piltdown he grins in side his dino topping cupola winds his winch handles and
then propels his wrecking ball towards the
where the huge stone ball smashes into some walnuts balanced on a boulder
piltdowns compact buddy pyrite cackles sweeps up the walnuts
munching them he balances a new one in place
it should be noted here that the relationship and physi cal appearances of piltdown and pyrite mirrors that of our heroes
theyre sort of an anti fred and barney
way ta go pilty baby
five bucks says you cant hit one on the fly
calling up yer on pyrite pyrite tosses a walnut which bounces on the ledge
the wrecking ball smashes into the stone wall
workers near fred duck as dust and debris fall down
people grab for their construction helmets
fred hustles up a ladder to a ramp which leads him up to the level of piltdowns cab
barney hurries to follow
all right piltdown thats enough
youre endangering your fellow workers
says me fred flintstone shop steward of amalgamated neolithic workers
one oh one gives us workers a snack break
a nasty grin im breakin some snacks
he swings the wrecking ball again
this time hes overdone it the wrecking ball flies past the walnuts pyrite ducks for cover and then the wrecking ball whips over and around the handrail which runs along
here twisting as tightly as indiana jones whip
the handrail wobbles dangerously in its foundation snorts backs up the crane supports on its back begin to creak and groan with the strain workers scatter fearful of the imminent
fred runs to grab the dinos reins
whoa whoa big fella he calms the beast by giving it a carrot
as it munches fred quickly ties the reins to a post
calling up to the cab youre on report piltdown
if its up to me youll be pushing a wheelbarrow
leaping down youve been asking for this flintstone
im gonna kick your fat butt fat butt
hold me back barney sotto very sincere barney hold me back quickly the men form a circle around piltdown and fred
barney looks up and sees it is shuddering and threatening to come crashing down
hey maybe you guys oughta fix that first
why should we
it looks dangerous
besides you can kick freds fat butt anytime
realizing a glare at barney i mean this aint over piltdown
turning shouting come on guys
lets clean up the mess
with much grumbling ropes and grappling hooks are gathered and the crew hops to it
slate stands in a blubbering fury as lava mops coffee up from the model and slates face
are you crazy
lava holds up a clay tablet covered with figures
its all here in hack and slice
when you committed to this housing development the price of dino kibble was a few clams per ton
since then its gone up a hundredfold
indicating the model you cant build a project like this without the heavy equipment dinos and we cant afford to feed those dinos
slate glowers paces around the model
im two months behind schedule my options running out on the land and donald trumprock is just waiting to jump in and steal the whole deal meanwhile that damn unions
on my back hell theyll probably want an eighty hour week or something
frustrated theres got to be an answer
a loud commotion outside the window attracts everyones attention
worried sounds like a workers comp claim if i ever heard one
all rush to the window
they look out and see supervised by fred all the workers are straining on the ropes to haul the rear legs of the crane back into their sockets on the
back of the big dino
only the last critical rope is still dangling
grab that line
barney scrambles up freds back shoving a foot in freds face but finally snatching the rope
he pulls on it
fred throws his own weight into the effort
thuds into place on the dinos back the workers cheer alas with its cable now twisted shorter its become an immovable object and as the shortened cable snaps the wrecking
ball begins to roll down the quarry wall
men and animals yelp and dive out of the way as the ball rolls downwards smashing everything in its path
the executives watch concerned as tumbles down down knocking scaffolding and ladders aside reaches the end of a ramp and drops through the air right onto where astonishingly the hood
sinks in resiliently like a trampoline and then with a loud sproing the wrecking ball flies straight back up into the air followed a beat behind by the unhinged hood itself
both hurtle towards the camera
react fearfully as they realize all this is coming straight for them
with a howl they all dive aside the wrecking ball flies through the window slams onto slates desk crushing everything in its path and then sails on smashing right into
where all of the lined up high rises smash aside with a sound like falling pins
the workers pick themselves up and now their eyes follow the path taken by the long gone wrecking ball
goodbye pension fund they rush for the office building
dust is still settling
the staff rises from the mess coughing
lava rummages in the debris finds a stiff body
uncle uncle speak to me but its only a statue of a golfer from one of slates trophies
sitting up im over here you moron and dont call me uncle
slates eyes fall on freds car hood swinging from a bookshelf
he reaches for it pulls it it stays put and only releases a new deluge of rubble and plaster which reburies him
at the same time the door slams open and fred barney and the other workers tumble inside
as they take in the destruction
barney notices the wrecking ball amidst the model buildings
as we watch the last remaining little high rise falls
hey nice going fred
you even got the spare barney shut up turning mr
slate are you all right
slate staggers to his feet seething with fury
he finally yanks the car hood free
it bounces and vibrates in his hands like a hand saw
eying the men for five years slate construction has had the finest safety record in bedrock
pacing angry our workers are trained in first aid our equipment is first rate and our dinos are worm free
and then something like this happens i want to know how
a cacophony of voices starts to answer
in the sudden silence i want one person to answer me waving the car hood whos responsible for this
nudges the wrecking ball off the edge of the table
it falls on freds foot
fred starts to scream and piltdown shoves a pencil holder into his mouth
quickly it was flintstone mr
thats right mr
slate it was flintstone
thats a lie mr
who are you
pointing to his forms b
white male personal reference pushing barney aside flintstone i have just one thing to say to you fred cringes
piltdown and pyrite smirk
pumping his hand congratulations
this stuff you had on your car is the most incredible building material ive seen in thirty years in the construction business
testing it its strong twirling it light bending it resilient it rebounds sproinging him on the chin
he recovers shakes it off
where on earth did you get it
oh its ah just something i whipped up in the old garage workshop quickly with a little help from my buddy barney right barn
well actually fred it was the other way ar fred hisses between his teeth repeats the slate and me are just like this gesture he made earlier points at slate
reluctant sure fred right right
slate nods distracted his eyes and hands running over the smooth lines of the car hood
the rest of you men go back to work
i want to talk to flintstone and the personal reference alone
come on move move
they go out piltdown looking furious
a man in love light as a pterodactyl feather
why a child could handle this
lava we could cut construction costs in half
whatchacallit patiently eighths eighths right
flintstone what do you call this stuff
slate i call it hesitating sotto barney what do i call it
sotto fibrerock fred
i call it fibrerock fred
realizing i mean ah fibrerock
rolling it over his tongue fibrerock
playing with it fib bre rock slates staff make disparaging noises
i love it
instantly reversing themselves love it
has a nice ring
says it all you know
slate takes the piece of material leans it on the table so it catches the light
despite himself lava comes over examines the car hood
cant help but marvel at it as well
meanwhile slate puts his arms around fred and barney
to lava you see this lava
all those courses of yours at harvrock university and who saves my bacon
two simple minded run of the mill nobodies
gee thanks mr
slate pulls fred and barney close with genuine excitement
boys this is a small step for slate construction
a giant step for all mankind
he points to the translucent material
camera tightens on it
we see fred barney and slates reflections in it
dramatically the stone age is over
let the fibre age begin
as heroic music stings in we
slate is in back crammed in with groceries
betty pulls up in front of a building that looks like a palm springs spa
this is lecole des enfants prehistorique
here we are mrs
sorry you had to ride in the back
getting out not at all
im used to being driven around
and shes sashaying up the path
betty and wilma burn then follow her
as elegant as we can get mmmcxv years before louis xiv
as the three women come in we see children with alliga tors on their deerskin shirts singing la hachette de ma tante est sur le roche de mon oncle coming
over gushing madame mrs
welcome to lecole des enfants prehistorique haute superior
thank you marie
showing a rock receipt i ordered the hors doeuvres for the junior talent show
they were out of ceolanth caviar so i got mastodon brie instead
oh ah these are my uh friends wilma flintstein flintstone oh it used to be flintstein
and this is ah becky
the headmistress reaches over takes their hands gracefully
waving a hand well madame slate as you can see we remain ze creme de la creme in the croissant of life known as bedrock
now your leetle gran nephew will be wiz us for two weeks no
opening a drawer here is ze application for him
an mais oui he weel participate in zee annual talent show naturalment
slate takes the parchment application
meanwhile the headmistress looks appraisingly at wilma and betty
an your friends perhaps would like zum school applications for zere enfants
oh marie really you dont understand suddenly thats right you dont understand
my husbands business manager usually handles this sort of thing but i dont mind
and to wilmas astonishment betty takes one of the parchments
i know bam bam correcting herself pardonez moi bem bem will love attending your school and performing in the talent show
thank you oh so much
she gives mrs
slate an even and controlled look and sends some of it over in wilmas direction as well
wilma makes her choice smiles tightly
let me have one of those too
for ma petite pebbles
any friend of madame slate is a friend of mine
slate reacts we theyre cruising along
fred puffs on a cigar
barney flips the pile of legal sized tablets in his lap
in the back seat are some boxes and bundles
gee fred i dont believe it
eight hours ago i didnt have a job and now look i got of one percent of the after taxes after expenses net breakage profits on fibrerock
just be thankful i was there to go over the fine print
full of himself its like i told you this morning theres something noble about a man digging in with his hands and doing an honest days work
once you file those dreams under old business and put your nose to the plow well the world is your oyster
and was i right
no fred you werent
i didnt nose any grindstones and you didnt shoulder a wheel
we just hung out together and everything that happened was a total accident
after a moment details barney details
smiling i just cant wait to see the girls faces when we tell em the news
the girls frowns are a great contrast to their husbands smiles
wilmas looking at the school enrollment forms
betty paces looks at the clock
seeing this its not like the boys to be so late
unless they were forced to go bowling again
remember that time a burglar pointed a gun at them and said go bowling right now
betty sometimes youre a little too gullible dont tell me
i still cant believe what i did today
indicating the forms do you have any idea of what the enrollment fee is
and get this
its non refundable i know i know
i just couldnt stand that womans attitude
but we had to find a new school anyway and there we were
the next thing i knew i was in over my head
but why did you jump in too
oh she was getting to me too with all that mastodon snort about her little nephew
if a friend cant help you do something stupid who can
betty smiles touched
then reality intrudes again
what do we tell the boys
whats wrong with the truth
we put ourselves in debt so the kids can attend school with a family we cant stand
pause maybe we could rephrase it
suddenly the door bursts open
fred and barney run in with candy and flowers
thats nice but
oh me and barn we suddenly realized that we had a little spare change
sotto not anymore you dont
presenting flowers betty these are for you
for sticking beside me during the tough times and well
for making a little guy feel like he was ten feet tall
i dont deserve these
i did something really stupid today
fred does something stupid every day and i still love him
fred laughs good naturedly grabs barney in a headlock
noogy noogy ha ha
observing this have you been drinking
in reply fred whips a bottle of champagne into view
ready when you are
noticing the label hey
a good year
this confuses the girls even more
fred theres no easy way to say this so she closes her eyes swings the enrollment forms over on the table so that fred and barney can read them
fred and barney look at them look at each other
they cant believe this
did you see
the dollar signs there at the bottom
the non refundable dollar signs
plenty more where that came from
we see your dollar signs ladies
he tosses his stone contracts on top of the parchment ones with a thud
we raise them
wilma and betty look at each other then at the contracts
they blink look again
fred opens the champagne which foams all over them
the girls squeal
you bet theyre real sweetheart
theyre as real as
well as real as embracing the group the best darn friends and neighbors in the whole world
barney squeezes back
and nothings ever gonna change that
emotionally right pal omine
as they laugh and the girls slowly absorb the truth we a sign proclaims this as grand bedrock lodge loyal order of water buffalo
the parking lot outside is full of vehicles
we hear the sound of a gavel banging
attention fellow water buffaloes
the members are milling about the main room schmoozing drinking kibitzing
all wear the furry and horned ceremonial fez of the buffalo
one wall of the lodge displays a big version of the lodge coat of arms with the motto ackus ackus adackus below a trophy case holds a mind boggling display
of various bowling trophies balls and pins
at the lectern the herdmaster a mustachioed inspirational type bangs again for order
brothers your attention
it quiets a bit
he clears his throat raises his chin and gives a strange mournful bellow
ritual type tone the herd is now called to the prairie
holding fingers above ears antlers
the entire lodge dutifully imitates this gesture
ack ack a dack
banging gavel this meeting of the water buffaloes is now in session
sergeant at arms have we got any old business
barney stands acknowledges his friends and lodge brothers
indeed we do brother herdmaster
tonight we are to hear speeches from prospective candidates for lodge offices such as good old fred and some other guys
seated across the room with pyrite and other cronies he immediately leaps to his feet paws the ground and gives an eerie moan even stranger than the herdmasters earlier call
after the cry echoes away brother piltdown you have given the cry of the gelded buffalo at the poisoned water hole
do you wish to file an objection
you bet i do
how come flintstone is good old fred and me and the other candidates are just some other guys
yeah how come
rising my apologies brother piltdown
allow me to rephrase
tonight we will hear speeches from a whole bunch of good old guys
pause plus the one and only fred flintstone
cheers go up which drown out piltdowns renewed cry of the poisoned water hole
fred moves towards the podium as the noise dies down
barney moves to the wall where he pulls a rolled up tapestry from a hiding place behind a plant
he tacks it to the wall yanks a string
its a big vote for fred flintstone poster
barney turns gives fred a thumbs up and as he does barneys hand brushes against a folded parchment in his pocket
barney pushes his way through the seats catches up to fred and hands him the document
fred takes it continues up to the podium
there the herdmaster hands fred the ceremonial hoof and antler crossed over each other like a pharaohs badges of office
fred does a papal like wave with these sets them down and unrolls the crib notes barney gave him
reading at first wooden then confident brother buffaloes honored herdmaster junior bucks and apprentice antlers a great good evening to you all
as you know our organization has survived difficult times that have seen the extinction of such other lodges as the order of whooping cranes and brotherhood of giant sloths
but we here have come through the croo the crux
grateful crucible with our fur fluffy and our hooves unscathed
now the future holds many promises and many problems
as your next herdmaster i would bring to you the same determination courage and if i may say so bold thinking that i have brought to the workplace
thank you and ack ack a dack
applause follows freds return to the floor
the only ones in their row not clapping they scowl as fred passes them
widen as barney propels a bowling ball stone of course rumbling down the alley sending pins flying
the buffaloes cheer barneys strike
we notice that most if not all of these lodge members also work at the quarry
it consists of a bent snout creature which cranks down a shelf with several monkeys on it
the monkeys grab the pins with their tails straighten them up
then the shelf cranks back up
now its freds turn
he trots up to the line bowls
more cheers ad lib complaints etc
the scorekeeper picks up hammer and chisel and fills out the last frame
hey when youre hot youre hot
boys lemme buy a round of drinks for everyone
thanks fred but here at the lodge drinks are free
but the principle is the same barn
dont forget that
fred leads the group over to the bar
piltdown and pyrite come along with a shrug
why not for a brew
fred reaches where he pulls out a hook beaked little lizard fred uses this creature to open several beers
during this here you go boys nice and frosty
aside go ahead laugh
if i had a good orthodontist my life woulda been different
fred tosses the opener aside the critter bounces into the shelf slides
when it re covers it realizes that its overbite has been straightened out by the impact
very happy it grabs a hat and coat exits
raising drink well heres to
he looks around sees its actually dots chipped into a stone
it shows the young fred barney and others gathered around soapbox racers
a banner reads junior buffalo day
heres to the greatest bunch of lifelong buffaloes a guy could dream of leading
an obvious prompt anybody else got a toast
heres to the water buffalo and their next herdmaster
aw gee barn
you shouldnt say that
winking at least not till after next weeks election
fred what was all that stuff in your speech about the workplace
i thought the only decision you made there was how many lunches to eat laughter
fred accepts it good naturedly reaches into his pocket
well harry it just so happens that old fred is moving up in the world
boys youre looking at mr
slates new partner
you and slate
who are you kidding flintstone
the only partner you got is hanging over your belt
pyrite laughs a bit too much
prepare to eat those words piltdown
if i dont you will a tight smile gentlemen my card he passes them out and the others take them curious
of course its a little stone tablet
but it does indeed say slate construction f
flintstone ad lib impressed hey way ta go fred
whoa gonna switch from a hard hat to a top hat freddy boy
examining the card ah its probably a phony
saying this he bites down on it
winces as a tooth cracks
tugs freds sleeve pulls him close
gee fred how come i didnt get any business cards
barney its all part of the plan
to the others yes boys you see i went up to my pal mister slate and single handedly made him an offer he couldnt refuse barney reacts to the single
handedly freddy boy he sez to me we gotta talk turkey fred we gotta talk turkey thats right just like that fred
fred realizes barneys got something on his mind
ah excuse us boys
fred pulls barney into a quiet corridor
they stand near a trophy case
theres some bowling trophies here with a variety of names on them
theres also trophies for pie eating contests and beer drinking chug offs these have only freds name on them
whats this single handed stuff
i distinctly remember at least four hands and two of them were mine
lowered voice barney we could tell everyone how you invented this fibrerock stuff how slate and lava found out about it by accident and all but what would that be
this is big business barney
we cant start telling the truth itd create the wrong impression
think about all the really big deals in history back to the beginning of recorded time
barney knits his brow in thought for maybe three seconds
what do they all have in common
as barney is stumped ill tell you
a front man
a guy whos out in the public eye running the point fighting the crowds
back in the corner is the silent partner
i never knew that
thats because the silent partner is always silent
but while youre busy being silent conspiratorially all along youre the brains behind the operation and im the brains in front of the operation
im out here running the guts of the operation but you got a cut
it looks like my mind but youre really behind
i get it
i got the brains but you just pretend to have them
and a confident fred shakes hands with an unsure silent partner
barney comes out of his front door heads toward the neighboring driveway and freds car
betty comes out calls to her husband
barney wait a minute
he stops turns
betty comes over and we see hes wear ing a sports jacket and an abysmally tied tie
betty fixes the knot
that looks more like a captain of industry
what would i do without you
probably run off to the tropics with one of those executive secretaries
come on betty its only my first day
you have to have seniority to run off
she giggles kisses him
is at the car door lunch pail in hand when wilma calls out to him
wait a minute
theres something wrong with your lunch weighing it yeah
it does feel a little light
he returns to her opens the pail is surprised to find its empty
before he can comment she smilingly presents him with a spanking new briefcase
f is embossed on it in gold
fit for a king
lookit its got buckles a strap a lock he opens it
inside is a huge drumstick and some ribs
baby youre the greatest
kissing him good luck
pause watch out for those
im already taken
he moves to the car
ah mister rubble i presume
of the fibrerock rubbles
looking good mister flintstone
i see youve recovered from that polo accident
the water was too deep and my horse drowned
they crack up at their own wit drive off
lavas on the phone very worried
ivan look okay so i bought too much on margin
everyone said glaciers were here to stay i mean who knew
just leverage my shares in atlantis dry goods and what
when did that happen
piltdown enters knocks on the open door
mister lava the armored car is here
must be a fortune in coo coo berries on that baby
you know for that fibrerock stuff of flintstone and rubbles
you gotta sign here for it
into phone i
ill get back to you
lava comes over signs the form
meanwhile he looks out the window at the guards are unloading sacks of coo coo berries
lava signs the form meanwhile looking piltdown up and down
finally piltdown this fibrerock program is going to create a lot of changes around the plant
i want to make one more
youve been a wonderful thug and goon for me
now id like to expand your duties
i want you to become a provocateur
gee mister lava i donno
i kinda like girls myself
patiently what i mean is im going to use you to double cross your lodge and union brothers and make their lives a living hell
you and your little pal will report directly to me and take orders only from me
slapping him on the back now get out of here and start screwing your former friends and associates
piltdown leaves smiling
lava rubs his chin thoughtful
coo coo berries
fred and barney appear in freds car make a very quick turn into the quarry lot
they both duck down behind the wheel
a moment later feldspars patrol car comes barrelling by
feldspar looks every which way doesnt spot them
when hes gone gee fred driving with you is better than an e ticket at magerock mountain
getting out gets the old adrenaline going barn
us big executives we need that kind of jolt to get the old wheels turning
lava comes into view carrying an armload of plans
oh hi mister lava
please call me jerry
uncle i mean mister slate told me to take you to your offices
if youll follow me
they move along
fred notices a hotbed of activity nearby
workers move scaffolding animals labor
whats going on
the fibrerock assembly line
unc mister slates had a crew working on it all weekend
were going to roll out the first sheets of fibrerock by mid week
quick dynamic entry into the marketplace
but fred its right where the employee basketball court used ta be
hey youre right
resigned big business is hell barney
youll get used to it
i guess so
you already did
lava leads them to a wood sided trailer
well gentlemen here you are
as soon as youre settled come over to the assembly line
well go over the fibrerock formula before the first run
he goes off
fred and barney go therere two tiny little desks at the far end separated by a flimsy divider
the single window here looks out over the quarry scrap heap
as we watch somebody dumps a load of debris
threadbare furniture on a worn rug sits under a portrait of our founder slate
fred and barney look at all this in turn
then they whirl give each other high fives
welcome to the top partner
and as they shake we now accompanied by heroic industrial type music we see the fibrerock assembly line in full operation
this cannot be described now with appropriate justice but it involves a series of animal powered conveyor belts rube goldberg like funnels spouts and chutes and all sorts of gadgets
gizmos bells and whistles to wit
at one end of the building dino powered dumpsters and lifters drop off all the ingredients these get stomped chewed bashed and otherwise reduced to powder which is then courtesy
of some squirting mastodans mixed with water into a foam which bubbles through a long sawmill type trough and is held back by a gate
meanwhile we see a sample item in this case a stone sofa as it is placed before two goatasauruses which butt heads and smash the sofa between the two halves
of a clay mold
when the mold is opened and the sofa tossed aside barney appears and personally aims the foam trough at a funnel in the top of the mold
pausing to taste the mix he smiles then shouts ready
barney pulls a rope which opens the trough
fibrefoam pours into the mold
gets winched unpwards by monkeys and then an alliga torsaurus whaps it with its tail
a fibrerock copy of the stone sofa drops neatly out of the mold bounces lightly on the conveyor belt below
it sparkles with the tell tale celadon green shimmer of fibrerock
as it chugs along the process repeats and soon a score of identical sofas is in view
as a beaming fred watches workers easily stack the fibrerock sofas often one handed
nearby we see fibrerock window frames doors chairs etc
slate and lava watch the progress dollar signs in their eyes
fibrerock products are stacked up everywhere stretching away like the inventory in charles foster kanes warehouse
we see everything from fibrerock bricks to fibrerock table lamps to fibrerock toilets
fred and barney weary approach each other shake hands as they view the days incredible output
other weary but proud workers gather around them mr
slate is about to address them from his office balcony
men this is a proud day for slate construction
you have seen the first pieces of fibrerock roll off the assembly line and into history
a history you are all part of
thanks to your very own fellow worker fred flintstone
they cheer slates remarks pat fred on the back
no longer will man and beast bend under the backbreaking load of stone and rock and timber
because fibrerock is so light that even a child can handle it
pause thats why on monday were going to hire two dozen children from bedrock technical junior high
theyll be replacing the heavy equipment operators shaft diggers and laborers were laying off today
your pink slips will be in your final pay envelopes along with a ticket to the grand opening of slate city
its non transferable so hang on to it
thank you and have a nice weekend
the workers stand slack jawed and stunned
thanks to fred flintstone
what kinda shop steward are you
all eyes swivel and bore into fred who is as shocked as anyone
you gotta do something about this
realizing i mean i do yeah
he squares his shoulders marches off
proudly thats my fred
slate is practicing hitting golf balls into an automatic putting cup
lava and some office workers are checking a blueprint against a model of slate city which is made out of fibrerock
a ball shoots back at slate who tees up again
a little mouse in a complete hockey outfit jumps to catch the ball
stopping it with his little hockey stick the mouse gasps raises its hockey mask
and its still pre season
he whaps the ball to slate again
slate tees up the ball again
fred barges in banging the door
startled slate drives the ball instead of putting it
it sails across the room and shatters a picture of mrs
slate we gotta talk we do eh
about those guys outside mr
some of em well they been here for years
and you well you cant lay them off just like snapping fingers that
slate looks at lava who shrugs
slate looks back at fred stays surprisingly calm
he toys with the putter balances it on his palm
of course i can fred
i can lay them off like snapping fingers that or like a different style snap that or like he does a really nifty snap which combines with a buck and
wing with the putter
bravura slipping oh you can huh
of course he can flintstone
its his quarry
still calm warm thats right
why chuckling i could lock the front door and go fishing if i wanted
lava laughs along with the office staff and slate
fred chuckles a little to fit in
winking why i could even fire lava here if i wanted
lava quivers with mock surprise
everyone really laughs now
wiping away a tear i could fire you fred
ah ha thats rich mr
slate thats suddenly fred stops laughing
flintstone lava here recommended that you be in charge of public relations to get fibrerock off to a good start
im a member of that public flintstone and i have to say
this isnt a good start
im getting a bad feeling about fibrerock
a bad feeling about
you want that feeling to go away dont you
well gee i
then turn around and walk out of here and well forget all about this
fred swallows looks at lava goes meekly out
all the workers watch expectantly as fred comes out
they ad lib well
whatd he say
ol freddie boy told him a thing or two
probably got us a raise
fred staggers over to his locker opens it
gets in and closes the door
we hear a muffled sob
as the workers slowly realize the mighty casey has struck out
betty and wilma stand determined while the kids gripe
but mommy i wanna go roller skating
mouth full yeagh
hend thugh guys wher ghoing swallow munch to play rockball at paleolithic park betty wipes bam bams mouth smiles sweetly
well youre both going to change your plans
your new school is going to have a talent show
and youre going to have some talent
you dont have to win
honorable mention or most kongenial kids is perfectly acceptable
aside as long as we beat the pants offa mrs
young lady this is not about beating pants this is about becoming a well rounded child
now what kind of act will you do
how about a disappearing act
he takes a tentative step away but betty grabs him
pebbles and bam bam sigh huddle
we hear snatches of discussion
wanna recite something
nah what are we little inky dinky spidersaurus
how bout magic tricks
we could cut up a newspaper but then wed need a hammer bam bam and chisel
oh what about that dumb thing
you that thing with dino
pebbles turns the decision made
were gonna sing a song with dino
instantly on cue dino leaps out of nowhere holding a straw hat and a cane
wilma and betty look at each other skeptical
bam bam reaches into his shirt and takes out a whistle
he blows it a one and a two and a music comes up and dino and his little friends do a dance routine we will call the dino dance
it is a spectac ular blend of soft shoe and the kind of dog and pony show gags usually seen in the circus or on the ed sullivrock show
most importantly the routine includes the following a dino leaps back and forth through a hoop
b the kids tie down a jump rope and dino does a wire walk
c and finally dino uses his tail to flip the kids onto his back culminating in a big ta da after they all slide down the rope for a big
winding up you can keep the twist the frug and hop i dont need to shimmy i dont need to bop cause im doin doin doin the igneous rock
panting for breath pebbles bam bam and dino wait for a reaction
to wilma impressed well
think theyre ready for the talent show
i think theyre ready for rock vegas
as they laugh and hug the kids and dino we fellow water buffalo
in a few moments we will cast our votes for the lodge officers
tight on fred as he leans back in his usual chair
the election committee will make the preparations
confident since when do you have to prepare for a landslide right guys
pause as fred waits for a reply
shot widens as he realizes no one is sitting near him
he looks around and sees its been altered to read fred finkstone
also added to freds image are horns a beard and other choice touches
fred looks around sees barney approaching having just left a group of angry buffalo
barn w whats going on
theyre mad at you fred
its understandable i mean they all got laid off today fred crosses to the other guys puts on a big smile
guys guys come on now whats a quarry fulla layoffs got to do with a lodge fulla buffaloes
is that a riddle
give me a second stepping forward ill tell ya what
mosta the guys in this lodge work for mr
slate you mean used to work for him until somebody opened their big mouth fellas come on
were all big boys here he gestures vaguely towards the outside world then back to the little band of brothers here
surely we can separate in our minds work and play
job and lodge
pointing at fred candidate and double crossing back stabber
i move we commence the meeting
and the election
i second the motion
all in favor say wait wait
your antlerness please one second
fred grabs barney by the shoulder spins him around pushes him forward like a refrigerator on a dolly stands him up center stage
barney you gotta tell the other guys what really happened
tell em the story behind fibrerock
the true story
the room quiets
barney clears his throat
fred waits hopeful
well theres not much to tell
trying to remember freds phraseology true i got a cut
but freds got a gut
no no the rest
oh yeah i remember
i got the mind but freds got the behind
barney turns gives fred a big wink
thank you brother rubble
the buffaloes will now have their secret vote
a command fit
everyone pulls their horned fezzes down over their eyes
everyone does a bull like stomp and scrape
all for piltdown bellow now
the room echoes with moose like snorts
all for flintstone bellow now
fred snorts sounding like herb alperts lonely bull
even under his furry fez we see him looking around desperately hoping to hear one more snort
he kind of sneaks in one more forlorn grunt which fades away
finally as fred squirms miserably there is one more lonely snort
from barney of course
the fezzes come up
the snorts have it
brother piltdown it is my privilege to install you as the new exalted herdmaster erect antler and big buck of our lodge
if youll come forward i will present you with the tokens of office
cheers and applause as piltdown goes to the podium
freds a broken man
barney moves over puts his arm around him
i voted for you fred
big deal after you screwed everything up in the first place
barney reacts really hurt
he moves away on the bench
freds so agitated he doesnt even realize it
piltdown accepts the festooned fez and shoulder ribbon smiles at the group
thank you brother chairman
fellow buffaloes im a man of few words
its no secret that most of our lodge members are also members of amalgamated neolithic
which means that most of us arent gonna be able to make our cave payments next month
so my agenda for tonight
ends right now
theres a time to be a buffalo
theres a time ta be a brown nosin double crossin creep
all heads turn and swivel to look at fred
and theres a time to stand up and be a man
so lets go down there and make the slate shop into slate scrap
then well see how he gets along without the heavy equipment operators of neolithic
with angry grumbles and threats the meeting breaks up
fezzes are thrown into cubby holes and hard hats are slapped on
the buffalo run out
when the dust clears we see that only one member has avoided the herding instinct barney
now he turns runs into fred is at the bar opening a beer
he looks wistfully at the old framed picture on the wall reacts as he sees even his childhood shot has been defaced
he sets his jaw with a screw em expression downs his beer
then barney runs up shakes him by the shoulders
the buffalo are heading for big trouble
they rejected the best candidate no no not that
piltdowns got the guys all worked up and theyre heading down to the quarry
theyre gonna wreck the assembly line
genuinely worried oh no
that thats horrible
pause we could end up with half a percent of nothing
no fred if they do that theyll be breakin the law
our brother buffalo could go to jail
oh yeah yeah that too
come on barn we gotta stop em
camera pans from the still yard to the gate
down the road we see piltdown leading the angry mob
quickly they go to the gate climb up and over it
lets start with slates golf trophies and work our way up to the assembly line
ad lib angry cheers and the mob storms into the plant knocking aside equipment and supplies
both pedaling like mad
i dont believe this
how did things ever get this out of hand
makes you wish things were back the way they were
before we was big executives
well i wouldnt go that far
suddenly theyre interrupted by the sound of a siren
fred looks back and sees coming up from rear
feldspar grabs his megaphone as he pulls abreast of fred
oh no not now
feldspar signals fred onto the shoulder
fred smiles nods
he slams them down through the floorboard freds car skids spins out whirling around like a record on a turntable
it jerks to a halt degrees later and then roars off in the opposite direction
so astonished he follows this action with his head
a bad move because sarge
the patrol car runs off the road crashing into a stone fire hydrant
water squirts into the air
feldspar and gravel are drenched
theyre just coming to their senses when the ground heaves the cars front wheels rise
as we see that the water spout is actually coming from the blowhole of a whale which now sticks a bit of its head up from under the broken curb
im gonna sue you for everything you got led by piltdown the workers have grabbed a big timber which theyre using like a battering ram on the doors of the
assembly line building
suddenly with a crash the doors go down
piltdown and pyrite stand back while the angry workers rush past them
loudly now well show em whos boss
they cant push us around
piltdown and pyrite smash a few items to get everybody juiced up and then
when no one is looking
they slip out the back
fred pulls into the lot slams his feet down to stop we hear skidding they fishtail all over slam right through a storage area for crates and barrels which collapse
all around them
finally they slam broadside into the main quarry build ing knocking a hole in the wall
fred and barney cough in the rising dust
neither one of them sees what we see which is that visible in the hole in the wall is the slate companys granite doored safe
and right beside it is the xenosaurus which now jumps up startled dropping a crowbar and a big hand drill
recovering its composure the xenosaurus grabs up the tools as well as a big canvas bag and tiptoes away vanishing just as our heroes stir
double taking barn
did you see that
peering through the dust huh now its gone
i coulda sworn
come on fred
time to earn those big bucks
they rush into the plant
as the workers continue their rampage piltdown and pyrite reappear
darn that flintstone and rubble
theyre gonna screw everything up
not if we give em a nice long vacation
in the hospital
saying this he grips tightly on a wrench
then some rampaging workers rush by
piltdown gives them an encour aging cheer and then he and pyrite lead them up some stairs to the assembly line catwalk
there pyrite begins smashing some light fixtures with a club while piltdown uses brute strength to snap big support beams which he flings below
winds up for another baseball type swing but as he follows through the ball shaped light fixture jerks up on its cable
unable to stop in time pyrite spins around falls on his ass
barney drops down into view hanging horizontally from the rafters
hes holding the light fixture with his free hand
stee rike one
ready for a curve ball
pyrite doesnt have a sense of humor club in hand he jumps up starts chasing barney through the rafters
spits on his hand grabs another big beam
he pulls down on it
but it doesnt snap it goes right up again
puzzled he pulls down on it again
theres another see saw motion
this time piltdown goes with the flow pushes up and peers under the beam
fred is hanging on the other end
can we talk about this antler to antler
piltdown roars begins slamming the girder up and down
fred inches down the shuddering beam jumps off
freed of freds weight the other end boings down on piltdowns head
he groans recovers in time to chase after fred
square off in the rafters
give me your best shot
barney ducks and pyrite smashes a window pane
barney dodges again and the same thing happens
getting cocky barney does it one more time
but this time the window is hinged in the center and the swivel action after the hit whaps barney on the back and knocks him into pyrites next blow
is backpedaling away from piltdown on the upper super structure of the assembly line
fred scrapes one foot in an arc in front of him
dare you to cross that line
piltdown crosses it
piltdown crosses it
fred marks another one
piltdown doesnt even wait for the challenge takes a giant step
bad idea the last line was at the edge of a straight drop
piltdown yelps treads air in the best cartoon manner and then desperately grabs a handful of freds clothing
both men fall at the last minute piltdown catches a ladder
fred lands with a thud right in the clay mold used to form the fibre products
worse the impact arouses the goatasauruses out of their sleep
dutifully they rise and then ram both sides of the mold just as fred is struggling to his feet
freds yell is muffled by the clay
aroused by the start up of the assembly line they do their job
fibre foam begins to chug down the trough the alligator crane picks up the mold shakes it
is flung to the conveyor belt stiffly caked in clay
shudders and shakes out a fibre statue of
the real fred moving stiffly like a robot is getting to his feet when his fibre doppleganger slams him to the mat again
a moment later another fred drops down beside him
has descended the ladder hopping mad
now he sees fred coming toward him
piltdown breaks a big lever off the equipment swings reacts astonished as fred back down the line hes seen this
his clay caked adams apple gulps
quickly he turns and tries to tip toe away then with a creak and crunch the clay and fibre all over him solidifies
desperate he tries to move
watches confused as dozens of fred flintstones chug towards him on the belt
he shrugs smashes the next one in line
he smashes the next one
dodging pyrites renewed attack
now barney becomes aware of the activated assembly line
getting an idea he moves behind an inspection table grabs a big rubber stamp
pyrite comes around the corner
barneys head butts him in the gut dodges under his legs
then as pyrite stumbles barney stamps his ass with the word reject
pyrite looks back sees this reddens
raises his club
whaddya say we reject your head
he raises the club
when an alligator swings down and grabs him by the seat of his pants
pyrite drops the club howls the alligator crane swings him away and over a big bin marked rejects and drops him
howling pyrite falls into a big bin of broken and defective fibrerock goods
chuckles to himself
and then looks down reacts
camera adjusts and we see that piltdown has smashed yet another of the duplicate freds
worried barney looks around sees that hes just above the fibrefoam chute
without another thought he jumps into it slides downward like a passenger on the magerock mountain log flume ride piltdown is about to swing at the real fred when barney
sails out of the end of the chute and slams into him and fred
all three of them roll across the floor towards
where a squad of policemen has just appeared led by a dripping wet feldspar and gravel
youre all under arr wham
barney fred and piltdown roll right into the cops who go flying like what else
tenpins complete with appropriate sound
sitting up whattya know
even got the spare again
then he gasps as he looks over at fred whose head has just fallen off
freds real head slowly pokes up out of the clay and fibre shoulders
before he can extricate himself further feldspar and his men are dragging them out of the building
wooden bars delineate the holding cells
wanted posters of stone are hanging on the walls
as we watch the contrite buffalos are bailed out by friends and relations
wilma and betty are just now clunking down stone money on the night sergeants desk
barney i dont understand
what came over you boys
to fred so long fatso
see ya barn
pause flintstone youre dead meat
fred is there something you want to tell me about the lodge meeting
i dont wanna talk about it
besides who cares about a bunch of jerks running around with furs on their heads
im more of a country club guy myself anyway
he goes out hardly looking at barney
wilma and betty look at each other mystified
then wilma follows fred out puzzled
lava stands in the shadows beside his porscherock
piltdown and pyrite are with him
in the b
fred and wilma drive away
a simple little heist i gave you everything but the keys and you blew it hey we got the union guys to break in and create a distraction didnt we
who knew flintstone and rubble would show up too
the day after slate city opens theres going to be an audit
if the stuff isnt gone by then well all be doing time until the bronze age
dont worry mister lava
were on top of it
they both turn and start down an alley
jamming together as they do
then jumps as barney comes up behind him and taps him on the shoulder
excuse me mister lava
i think you oughta know
something could be wrong with the fibrerock mix
thrown how do you know that
recovering i mean
ah why do you say that
it tastes different
see ever since i started with fibrerock i mean since me and fred started with it i always take a little taste of the fibre foam
and tonights batch well
i didnt get much of it but it seems a little off
smacking his lips cant fool the old taste buds heh heh
i think there might be an ingredient missing
so tomorrow ill run a couple of tests and stuff rubble rubble
were fighting a deadline to finish slate city
and were not pulling the plug on production to satisfy your tastebuds
if you ask me you and your tastebuds are overworked overwrought
how long have you been with us anyway
nine days mister lava
jumping jurrasic no wonder youre so run down
he puts his arm around barney leads him towards the car where betty is waiting
im authorizing a nice vacation for you rubble
you can catch some rays maybe invent something
hey how about fibrerock the sequel part ii
but no dont try and thank me
slate and lava are examining a newer and larger model of slate city
its even more grandiose than its predecessor
now the housing development has two huge office buildings beside it and then a convention center beyond that
as you can see the fibrerock is so light were using it for construction for furnishings
you cant stack a two bedroom cave this high
but the skys the limit with fibrerock
skys the limit
skys the limit
why these two buildings they
they practically scrape the sky
we should call them
thats brilliant unc
in fact maybe you can help me with the centerpiece of the complex
indicating the convention center i wanna call em the fibresphere and the something needle
but i just cant
modestly how about slate needle
astonished how do you keep coming up with these
shrugging its a gift
casually oh that reminds me sign these will you
just a few overruns minor cost problems
slates so busy admiring his moment to himself he hardly listens to what lavas saying just runs his stylus through the wet clay of the statements meanwhile framing the model
city in his hands
heading for the door oh mister slate were going to hold the bedrock junior talent show in the uh slate needle
good for public relations lava breaks off
hes just looked out the window and seen a small figure appears behind some of the equipment tiptoeing from console to cabinet and thus towards the assembly line
wearing sunglasses with attached nose and a hook on beard it at first appears to be some sort of bizarre hermit or bum
and then we realize hey this is barney
looks around spots piltdown and pyrite now resplendent in security guard uniforms
lava whistles softly to get their attention cant
then he sees one of slates golf trophies
he shrugs throws it
reacts as the trophy bounces off his head then looks up to see lava gesticulating
piltdown nods grabs pyrite in tow
looking around carefully barney takes out a thermos bottle unscrews the top and quickly dunks it into the fibrerock foam
then he tiptoes o
right into the massive bulk of who looks down at him with a big smile pyrite at his side
can we help you
fake crotchety voice ah yup yup young feller
jest show me the way to the personnel office
im lookin fer a job as a custodian
then they grab barney with such force that the thermos drops and shatters drag him o
barney is tossed outside landing in a heap amidst the picketing workers of neolithic
chuckling ya can start by cleaning the street with your pants
still laughing piltdown and pyrite cross over to lava who has come out of the office building
that takes care of the half pint
pause now to deal with the half wit
lava walks fred from the door into the color coordinated high style room
on the move but barney doesnt want to take a vacation he says hes gotta be here to check up on the fibrefoam pointedly oh
or check up on us
emotionally lava turns indicates a picture of slate on the wall
thats a slap in the face of our founder
turning back another tone unless of course you agree with rubble
that mister slate isnt capable of running this operation that im not capable of running it
nervous of course not mister lava
but call me jerry
sit down please
lava winces as his designer furniture creaks under freds weight but he only says offering one cigar
why yeah sure jerry
fred let me get to the bottom slime
some men you and me for instance were cut out for the big time the big bucks
eyeing freds girth the big everything
lava smiles prepares the tips on two cigars
he puts each one in turn in a gizmo on his desk
its actually a frame supporting a little lizard
the lizard bites the tip off the cigar practically chokes on it finally manages to spit it out with difficulty
aside when they say smoking is bad for your health theyre not kidding
now lava takes out a lighter leans across the desk
as lava works the mechanism two wooden twigs rub rapidly across each other and ignite
now i know your pal barney had a small part in the preliminary research and development of fibrerock
well actually i wouldnt say small part
kind of a medium sized
well almost medium sized
well really a semi partial assistant counsulting type of giving fred a playful punch youre too kind flintstone thats what i like about you
but youre a big guy with a big decision to make
are you gonna keep covering for barney keep pulling his acornsauruses out of the fire
or are you going to concentrate on your own important duties
well gee thats tough one pause uh what are my important duties
publicity flintstone publicity
and thats why ive got a little surprise for you
for the man who made fibrerock a household word i want you to meet the man whos going to make you a household word
lava throws the door open
freds jaw drops as he sees r rockin leach
indeed it is he and he smiles extends his hands
ive eard a lot habout you from mister lava
hats why were going to put you on our program
on on television
patting his back sotto right fred
as long as you forget all this nonsense about barney
still in a dazed thrill barney who
three big dino mounted trucks are parked in front
you have to read the words on all three rockstyles of
technicians roll out gear set up big spotlights etc
rockin leach is surveying the place with an aide
fred and wilma are with them
leach makes a frame with his hands pans the area
lovely little guest ouse mister flintstone
so simple so ordinary so unexceptional
why hits almost quaint
lets say we start with the camera ere except
leach breaks off looks over the fence at the rubble homestead
he shakes his head sadly
w whats wrong
well just look at that yard over there
barbecues and trikes not exactly the right image
pointing maybe you could move those plants to block them out
rodney get hoppin with those greens
the aide nods gathers some workers
they start moving the potted plants
puzzled wilma comes over
fred this was supposed to be a typical evening at the flintstones and you invited fifty people i dont even know
now whats going on
where are they taking my ficus sauruses
its the rubble yard wilma
its just not the right image
he starts away suddenly notices his own barbecue and trikes
quickly without missing a stride he tosses a tarp over them slides a potted plant over for good measure
betty hair and face done but still in a slip is putting a reluctant bam bam into a cute little blazer
in the f
barney finishes tying a black tie then struggles into a dinner jacket
i dont know why you want to go to this thing
after the way freds been treating you lately freds in a high powered executive job betty
theres a lot of pressure on him
and its all around his belt
if it wasnt for poor wilma i wouldnt give him the geological time trust me betty
after the fibrerock debut hell be the same old fred
both react to the sound of hammering and sawing
curious they go out the sliding bedroom door into the yard and see the television crew has just finished nailing boards up over the top of the fence
now the big potted plants are dropped into place
with each hammer stroke or thud a little more of the late afternoon sun is shut off until barney and betty are in shadow
finally a canvas tarp is tossed as gracefully as pizza dough sails into the rubble yard and covers their bird bath
one last stray end lands on barneys head
inside each one a little bird in hardhat and smoked visor lights up the arc gets knocked on his butt when it catches
slowly getting up ive heard of a flash in the pan but this is ridiculous
hes squirming uncomfortably under the attentions of two crew members who are busy with scissors and combs and brushes
finally theyre done and leave him
he has been cut and trimmed like a french poodle
he gets a glimpse of himself in the swimming pool and freaks out
then he arches his back shakes out the hairstyle
the main title of the show can be heard o
the man who brings you the romance and excitement you crave
from the casinos of monte carlrock to the glamour of hollyrock heres your guide to the rockstyles of the rich and famous rockin leach
leach takes his cue from the director good evening
tonight we come to you live from the ah
charming pied a terre of the man of the our fred flintstone leach pauses hearing the sound of someone chipping away at a stone tablet
he looks up at he has just carved frederick into a stone cue card and points to it
ere we are at the ome of bedrocks man o the our frederick flint more chipping
leach looks up and sees now hes carved something grander
leach sighs goes on
ere we are at the fabulous ome of bedrocks man o the our frederick von flintstone
barney and betty appear bam bam in tow
they come out into the yard
betty waves at wilma who comes over whispers
there isnt one person i know here
you mean beside fred
i mean including fred
they look over at where leach has pulled fred on camera
fred is posing fluffing his ascot etc
we notice a fvf embroidered patch on his jacket
frederick of course is the man behind fibrerock the invention that some predict will revolutionize life in the future
frederick ow does it feel to know that you ave personally brought the stone age as we know it to a long deserved end
very affected accent well rockin youre right i have affected destiny for all mankind and its a sobering thought
however if i may add a personal note at this time i myself cannot personally take all the credit for fibrerock
react with hopeful expressions sotto to them see
whatd i tell ya
no i could never have done it without the inspiration and support of a very special person
im speaking of course of my close friend and associate mister slate founder and c
of slate construction
barneys face falls
so do wilma and bettys
in the far future manhattan will have new jersey
philadelphia will have levittown
will have burbank
but today bedrock has
both decorated in pennants and bunting connected to each other by a gangway six stories up
block letters on the fibresphere proclaim slate construction brings you the wonderful world of fibre
a heroic statue of slate himself stands close by the structures
sphere and needle of course are dead on parodies of the trylon and perisphere centerpieces of the worlds fair
a limousine pedaled by two chauffeurs pulls up
slate and lava and lavas son poindexter get out
it is immediately evident that the little obnoxious acorn hasnt fallen far from the tree
is this ever keen
dad you promise i can cut in all the lines
of course poindexter of course
they head for the mastodon and pully powered elevator
standing there are piltdown and pyrite both in security guard uniforms
piltdown is carrying a vaguely familiar satchel
lava gives them a big look
as the elevator rises his two cronies duck into a stairwell marked no admittance
the party is in full swing
we see pebbles and bam bam squirming uncomfortably in their party clothes
they take some canapes off of a table take a bite
spit them out
stands beaming nodding to his guests
good to see ya
glad you could make it
unconvincingly hello frank
fred theres the bar make yourself at home mi casa es votre casa so when in rome and all that coming over fred can i talk to you
concerned we have a serious problem with betty and barney
alarmed you mean you can see their house
exasperated i mean youre treating them horribly
whats come over you fred
does a little money mean so much to you that you just turn your back on the things that really count
wilma im shocked
i wouldnt do that
okay i admit it im trying to make an impression here i wanna look good i wanna be a success
he takes her hand looks into her eyes
for a moment wilmas face softens
but deep down inside im still the same lovable guy you married pause frederick von flintstone the third arrrgh
she throws up her hands stalks away
whatd i say
hangs up the sea shell phone runs over to leach
that was our location guy at slate city
they just moved the ribbon cutting up by an hour
guests are already starting to arrive
ive ad enough crab meat and crabgrass to last me a year
all right boys thats a wrap
in the middle of a tight little group which is pigging out
fred seems oblivious to the fact that theyre oblivious to him
yas yas its a challenging commodity market these days
personally im considering petrified forests but they do say that volcano futures are ready to explode ha ha
suddenly fred notices that his audience has evaporated
he looks around sees everyone headed for their cars the tv crew packing up etc
hey whoa whats happening
whats happening isnt happening here
the actions over at slate city
oh thanks for the booze ed fred
he stumbles through the thinning crowd clutching at elbows
hey whats the hurry
we got a cake shaped like a piece of fibrerock
i got it how about some charades
no even better twenty questions am i animal mineral or fossil
oh i heard a great one the other day a guy walks in a bar with a duckasaurus on his head and the bartender says thisll kill you the bartender
says fred stops running out of steam along with his moment of glory
he stands alone on the lawn
wilma slowly comes up to him
im sorry its not working out
fred turns puts on a big smile
whaddya mean not working out
theyre goin party hopping thats all
thats what ya do in society wilma
you cruise around
theyll go over to slates shindig for a while then theyll come back here
you go on over to slate city okay
fred i want to be here with you
nah me and some of the guys from the country club were gonna play poker yeah big stakes poker until everybody comes back
go on with the others
the kids got their show to put on anyway
and i wouldnt want people to think
to think the flintstones were party poopers
she doesnt know what to say or what she can say that wont shatter his shaky image
she sighs kisses him then calls out
come on pebbles
were going to another party
will there be real food there
well find out together
she takes the girls hand and goes to the door where the last of leachs crew is just going out
suddenly betty catches up to her bam bam in tow
im going with you
if friends cant do something stupid who can
wilma smiles touched
lowering her voice maybe if we leave the boys alone
wilma nods hopeful
the film crew caravan is already leaving as wilma betty and the kids get into the rubble car
the last tv crew man extinguishes the big spotlight
the house is dark forlorn in the fading twilight
fred sits forlorn in the rubble of his party
dino comes over nuzzles his leg
just you and me now dino
man and mans best friend
he gives dino one of the canapes
dino tastes it makes a face spits it out
dino runs off going ptooie all the way
we see him run to the corner jump in bettys car and drive away
sighs looks around down at his blazer and the fvf patch
he suddenly rips it off in a fury
then he looks at fred stares at it his face slowly darkening
then he grabs a lawn chair from the yard begins to smash it in a fury against the divider
the wall cracks splinters the potted plants go flying
his anger spent he stands panting splattered with dirt
then he sees standing in the ruins of the wall
the figure sneezes whacks dirt off of itself
its disbelieving b
moving closer hiya fred
noticing his ruined tuxedo boy the rental place is gonna be mad
eyeing the mess you feeling better pal
how can you call me that
ive been such a
but more of a helpful tone fool
snapping fingers stuck up blimpasaurus
wincing but taking it barney
can you ever forgive me for being such a jerk
stepping closer sure fred
smiling ive had lots of practice
touched aw barn
and he grabs barney in a big bear hug
tears in both their eyes they slap each other on the back two prehistoric sensitive guys
little cupola cars are chugging around the upper level of the fibresphere where they enter a tunnel like open ing labeled the world of fibre
wilma betty the kids and dino are in one of these
now we follow them as they chug into
the cupolas rattle along in disneyland style passing a sign which reads fibrerock transforming the home
here mechanical figures in an all fibre home move klutzily around the room
a la the great gildersleeve welcome
welcome to the fabulous world of tomorrow
a world brought to you by fibrerock
revealing that behind the hollow shells of the human family is a veritable family of monkeys all working the figures like puppets
a parrot at a stand mounted microphone is giving the narration
here we see a typical family of the future free of the cares and worries of today
yes the great kibble crisis is a thing of the past when youre living the good life
the cars chug past a display of tree trunks leaves bubbling gunk
and those iridescent vegetable pearls weve come to know
coo coo berries
iron bars and vault like doors separate the coo coo berries from the other items
here gathered from the four corners of the globe are the secret ingredients of fibrerock
some common some rare
all making life easier for you and yours
the little cars chug into an elegant salon complete with runway
theres another parrot here in front of another megaphone but this parrot is chic and flamboyant
but does fibrerock belong only in the kitchen the garage the workplace
no no no my darlings
as each girl struts forward she shrugs off a bulky animal fur and tosses it into a garbage can
underneath are all kinds of daring and tantalizing fashions woven in the tell tale fibre colors
the clothes are a blend of the future and retro that is prehistoric retro
because the clothes of the stone age are as extinct as stones themselves
yes thanks to the wonder of fibrerockfibre the world of high fashion will be totally transformed
by fibre furs
fibre foundations and fibreshoes
its to die for
now we see a display of fibrerock props of all kinds appliances toys tools etc
all of it upstaged by a choir consisting of every animal bird and critter weve seen in this film
wilma betty the kids and dino ooh and ahh with the other guests as the mechanical animals all sing in unison its a fibre world you know its a fibre
world you know its a fibre world you know fred and barney are surrounded by books and cartons and memorabilia
they have their arms around each other and are singing
now its time to do or die grab that rock and kick it high lets fight fight fight for bedrock high
they break up laughing
fred chuckles looks at one of the many old photographs strewn around
boy those were the days barney
bedrock high winning all those games
and you and me right in the middle of it
the photograph dots in stone shows the young fred and barney in their cheerleading costumes
barney has a sweater and megaphone fred is in a godzilla like mascot costume
hes holding the hideously sculpted head under his arm
too bad we never made the team
we made the team spirit
thats just as important
whatever happened to those cheerleader costumes
you know betty
she never throws anything away
he hauls out an old footlocker opens it
there they are
rummaging in it boy
talk about memories
fred tosses the cheerleader sweater to barney who grins pulls it on
fred also starts to get into his old uniform but has to suck his gut in mightily
finally he can zip it up stern to stem
back then we thought a pop quiz was a big problem
we didnt know how good we had it
no problems no worries
saying this fred attempts to put on the godzilla like head
he has a hard time sliding it into a hinge rail behind his neck an even harder time swinging it down and forward
speaking of problems and worries shouldnt we get on over to slates party
fred has finally clinked the monster head down into place
now when he talks the monsters mouth moves in sync
echo y what for
so him and all his fancy friends can look down their noses at us
completely covered in the ferocious looking suit fred steps over to barney stabs an angry claw in his direction
echo y all theyve been doing is using us barney
and meanwhile now fred reaches up to take the head off
it sticks for a moment
finally he gets it to flip back on its hinge where it hangs behind his neck like a ski parka hood
normal voice meanwhile all the time they were laughing at us
when did you notice that
about an hour ago
boy theres no fooling you fred
suddenly with a growing creaking cracking and tinkling a scale model of slate city in the corner begins to fall apart
fred and barney look at each other startled then rush over to the model
its the interim version we saw earlier
the decomposition continues walls and supports turning into sand and running down before our eyes
in a rube goldberg like continuum the little houses go first falling like dominoes
barney tries to stop the process cant
i dont know
the fibrerock its
but this shouldnt happen
your old models are just fine
indeed the older models from barneys tinkering days are rock solid
it should be
theres enough coo coo berry resin in there to petrify a brontosaurus suddenly barney gets it
he looks from the older models to the now decomposing little fibresphere with growing awareness
snapping his fingers the coo coo berries
fred thats it
remember i said the fibrefoam tasted funny
it was the coo coo sap that was missing
why would why
because coo coo berries are as valuable as goldrock
and weve had tons of em delivered to the plant since we started
somebody musta got greedy not somebody lava
alarmed fred that sap acts as a fixative its the glue that holds the whole formula together
with mounting concern then
whats happening here
finishing it is gonna happen for real in the real slate city
wilma and betty and the kids theyre all there with a final whimper the little fibresphere caves in and then the nearby slate needle crumbles model story by model story
finally the disk on top of the needle is all thats left wobbling around like a spun dinner plate
it finally falls
worried b barney
what do we do
barney runs to a locker grabs a big plunger powered flit gun begins filling it with a red liquid
coo coo berry sap fred
its our only chance their only chance
barney gives it a quick test squirt
fred nods and they rush out of the room
camera pushes in on the ruins of the model slate city
widen from a young kid who is drinking a glass of water and simultaneously singing with a ventriloquists dummy
obviously the talent show has begun
in the audience lava fidgets with nervous and confident energy
gives wilma a big look
youre certainly looking lovely this evening mrs
life with a junior executive must agree with you
looking into her eyes yes
i think so too
smiling imagine how good youd look with a senior executive
is fred getting promoted
lava laughs sure shes kidding
then not so sure
the ventriloquist finishes to scattered applause
the kid bows gets up
splashes across puddles of water on the stage area
the headmistress of lecole superior et al steps up
behind her the picture window displays the expanse of slate city the twin slatescrapers framing endless rows of little tract houses stretching to the distant volcanic ridge
as applause dies sank you ladies and gentlemen
an sank you monsieur slate for zis lovely setting
zoot alors zis will ze mos fantastic recital in bedrock istoree
now i would like to sank out mos generous benefactress madame slate for her fine support ovair zee years she gestures into the audience where mrs
slate stands waves a gloved hand like the queen mother
an now what better introduction could we ave for mrs
slates vairy own gran nephew
she steps aside
curtain rises on little poindexter
he is carrying a leather and bone accordion
he begins to play singing loudly dino of spain i adore you right from the moment i saw you
their smiles become fixed
up on the spotlights the little birds who operate the lights put earplugs in their ears
in the wings with pebbles and bam bam dino moans hides his head under his paws
on the refreshment table glasses crack
a cake falls
he surreptitiously checks his wrist watch
this one a pocket job
like lavas its really a little sundial with a built in burning match above it to provide a shadow
we widen and see that this watch is held in a green scaley claw
its the xenosaurus lurking behind the exhibits
now the creature grunts confidently lights up a cigar
then it picks up a canvas bag and a big toolbox and tiptoes into the deeper recesses of the fibre ride
fred and barney rush along fred at the wheel
whatll we do when we get there
we just tell mister slate that all acres of his development are going to crumble into dust any minute
holds up the flit gun then we zap the stairs and corridors with some of this coo coo sap
i just hope we have enough to get everybody out whoops
hes said this last because as he held up the flit gun the handle whacked the back of freds monster costume and the head has flipped down with a solid
swerving all over the road i cant see straight barney gets up on his knees grabs the wheel with one hand and the monster head with the other
hang on hang on oops
he rotates the head completely around
fred flails around
barney grabs the wheel with one hand tries to help fred with the other
it careens around even more wildly now
theres several near collisions
rockdonalds is of course complete with golden arches of stone a drive up window etc
it even has the oblig atory cops on a break
in this case feldspar and gravel
theyre sitting in their patrol car eating from little bamboo containers shaped just like mcdonalds styrofoam
of course the logo on the building behind them proudly reads over sold
mouth full bitching speed traps again
face it gravel
im in a rut
and meanwhile the guys who went through the academy with me theyre all big shots now sam slate
and you know why
cause they got the breaks thats why
suddenly both officers react to the sound of skidding tires and honking horns
they look out their window at both still battling the wheel and the resistant costume head
by now their gyrations have put barneys face inside the jaws of the monster mask
s sarge d did you see that
some sorta creature was attacking that little guy
theres a lesson there gravel
never pick up hitchhikers
besides realizing did you say creature
they do a big double take at the now vanishing car
excited feldspar bangs his dashboard and a dispatch parakeet in a police uniform pops into view
feldspar grabs it around the neck holds it like a microphone
this is a xenosaurus alert
repeat a xenosaurus alert
the creature has been sighted on the slate city exit of the venturock freeway
it is driving a brown late model sedan and eating a white male caucasian
car twelve is in hot pursuit
he releases the bird which doesnt fly away right away but gives him a look
remembering oh yeay
over and out
the bird nods appeased flies off
as it goes awwk
car twelve is on the way
car twelve is on the way
thrilled gravel this could mean promotions for both of us
trotting up to speed load the shotgun and turn on the siren
barney is rocking freds head back and forth finally gives it one last mighty yank
barney falls back on the passenger side of the car
fred drives with one hand raps the monster head
when fred speaks again the monster mouth no longer opens and closes in sync
muffled shouting ho gweat
hoo bwoke hit bahnee
hi khnat twalk hennymore
suddenly both men pardon man and xenosaurus react to an approaching siren
they both look back at closing in
gravel has produced a little sabre tooth cat and is cranking its tail
as it wails away the cops close in on our heroes
turning to barney haybee whee hould shtop
what and explain what youre doing in that costume
start talking about coo coo berries and fibrerock
by then itll be too late
hen yore height yore height
fred pours on more speed
they careen around a turn
camera whip pans to a road sign slate city mi
a fence surrounds the empty housing development in the distance we can see the dark slate scrapers and past them the brightly lit and gleaming fibersphere and slate needle
we hear a screech and then the camera pans back to pickup freds car as it whips around a turn two wheels off the ground
it crashes right into the gate knocking down a sign reading slate city delivery gate
the fence collapses all around the car
fred and barney stagger out of the wreck
barney covered with debris rummages around and sighs with relief when he finds the flit gun of coo coo sap is still intact
hearing a siren wed better split up that way at least one of us can make it to the slate needle
ood whuk ol bhudee
they slap hands together like basketball players then head off in two directions
camera pans the audience as the accordion recital con tinues
several people look visibly ill
finally camera adjusts to take in poindexters big finish as he slides forward on his knees
theres a scattering of half hearted applause led by lava and the slates
sank you sank you
our nex performance is bam bam pebbles
checking notes an friend
she steps aside as a spotlight picks out poised in the stances we recognize as the first positions of the dino dance
however whereas the previous version of this was done impromptu and a cappella with only a few primitive props and straw hats alone this time the kids and dino are
fully costumed with sequins batons and the like and the dance is completely choreographed
you can keep the twist the frug and hop as the dino dance begins full orchestration over it
the audience seems to really like it all except
who glances over at the judges long enough to see that they like this a lot better than the accordion act
slate jumps up barges on stage
the madame slate what ees wrong
ill tell you whats wrong
this act is an absolute disgrace
this is supposed to be a talent show
and a pedestrian animal act like this belongs in a circus
react furious jump out of their seats
a circus huh
well if our kids belong in a circus with their act then your little nephew belongs in a zoo with his yeah a zoo where the animals are dead because
if they arent they will be
why how dare you
flintstein ill have you know that my little poindexter has been trained by the finest tutors
the kid jumps up begins to play
immediately another glass shatters
but then the ceiling fixtures crack and then the picture window panels begin to shatter one by one
thats enough poindexter
the kids stops
but another window panel explodes
then one of the tables collapses
every head in the room swivels around and stares at poindexter
nervous he tosses the accordion aside
but the destruction continues another window panel shatters
then the entire building shakes
loses his balance grabs onto lava for support ends up pulling him down too
slate gets to his knees and looks out the window
and his jaw drops in astonishment
in the distance with a crackling roar the little rows of fibrerock tract houses are falling like dominoes in a wave that is rolling toward the slate needle
a flashlight beam rakes the camera
feldspar shotgun in one hand light in the other looks around cautiously
the shotgun has a slingshot mechanism the flashlight is a mirror backed candle
behind him footsteps approach
feldspar tenses but its no sign of the driver
by now hes a couple of shinbones and a belch
gravel drops down on one knee excited
he shines his light on freds big clawprints
look how deep these tracks are
that xeno thing must weigh a ton
they aim their lights at the tracks begin to follow them
suddenly they round a corner and come face to face with hes stopped between two sample homes to wrestle with the monster head again
now he freezes in twin flash light beams
okay lizard reach for the sky
then hearing a creak and groan he looks at the house beside him
the stucco like exterior of fibrerock is beginning to crumble
offisser fledapar het me hexpwain his howse hiss maid uv fibahwock he reaches out to tap the nearby wall and wham it collapses all around him leaving a gaping hole
in the house
frightened backing away quivering quartzite d did you see that following him o one flick of his paw
and he knocked down a wall
nogh wate chum baggk as fred roars and moves forward feldspar and gravel scream panic and run
tries to catch up and collides with the already damaged house
it collapses totally falling in on itself obscuring fred
finally the last timber drops
fred staggers out of the rubble realizes that the impact has knocked the monster mask off his head and back on its hinges
he rubs dust out of his eyes turns and looks at the slate needle
hes much closer to it now
quickly he runs toward it
everyone is rocking back and forth with the escalating vibrations of the swaying building
the remaining table of refreshments slides across the room
gets hit full force by a flying cake shaped like slate city
he falls on top of his accordion smashing it with one last dissonant squeeze
they pause in their panic to applaud gratefully
the supporting pylons and cable anchors begin to slowly decompose
a flight of stairs creaks and groans
barney runs into the shot sees the steps about to go dives for them
he ends up with a face full of fibredust
now he whirls as fred runs up points barney
barney runs toward it hits the button
revealing elevator mechanism
the button pokes a mouse which runs out of a box
seeing the mouse a nearby mastadon becomes frightened begins running
a heavy cable tied to the mastadon runs over a pulley and into where the elevator rises out of the sub level and into view
fred and barny start towards it
when suddenly the fibrerock elevator begins to crumble
use your coo coo gun
barney aims pulls back the plunger
the elevator is gone
the cable swings back and forth loosely whapping the shaft walls as it shoots upwards
fred dives for the cable misses
as he stumbles barney leaps on freds back catches the cable
as barney starts to whizz upwards fred garbs onto his ankles
propelled upwards the would be rescuers shoot out of the frame disappear into the fibresphere with a crash
the police chief looks skeptically at feldspar and gravel who are exhausted covered with dust uniforms torn
feldspar if you ask me youve seen too many rockzilla movies in all the xenosaurus sightings weve had reported not one has had this kind of wholesale destruction chief you
you gotta believe me just one swipe of its paw and wham a whole house was pre history
suddenly one of those police dispatch parakeets comes flying excitedly through the window lands on a perch in front of the chief
calling all cars
calling all cars
unconfirmed reports of destruction and collapse at slate city
rescue vehicles are on the way
the xenosaurus has been spotted in the area
that is all
that is all
excited you see
i told you all right feldspar im convinced
as of this moment youre completely in charge of operation
dramatic xeno dino
now what do you need
camera tightens on feldspar
this is the moment hes waited for all his life
firm jawed artillery
dust and little fragments of construction material are still tinkling down around our heroes
the elevator cable sways from its uppermost pulley
slowly something stirs in the pile of arms legs and scaly limbs
first to sit up is barney who groans rubs his head
next fred sits up
the impact has knocked freds monster mask back on his head
fred mutters angrily
barney starts to help
and then they both notice that theres another monstrous head in the middle of their group
therere big takes all around and then the xenosaurus leaps out of the tangle of bodies treads air and runs away
recovering fred stop it
it might know the way inside
fred gets up to speed and chases the xeno
fred and barney both leap on the mysterious xenosaurus all crash through a wall the panicked partygoers turn as a section of wall collapses
dust and debris billow upwards
the battered monster mask breaks loose from freds costume bounces on the floor
slowly everyone gets up fred
barney and two halves of the xenosaurus the bottom half is piltdown the top half is pyrite
what the devils going on here
its real simple mister slate
your boy lava here has been stealing the coo coo berries from the fibrerock mix and fixing the books to hide it
thats ridiculous flintstone
nobody could get that many coo coo berries off our premises
suddenly the bottom of piltdowns canvas sack rips open
thousands and thousands of coo coo berries tumble out
slaps his hands over his face
dryly these sure look like coo coo berries to me smoothly theyre convincing fakes mrs
rubble part of our exciting display fakes
to piltdown gee pilty i thought the real ones were gonna be moved up here for us ta steal whatta waste a time pyrite shaddup snapping fingers now i remember
these guys were pulling this xenosaurus act that night at the plant
whats this lava
are you going to stand there while aspersions are being cast at the slate family
this is absurd of course it is
why without the coo coo berry sap fibrerock would be completely realizing unstable
suddenly the entire building shudders
dust falls from the ceiling
everyone looks at lava
all right all right i admit it
i got in over my head in the stock market
took some big losses
i had these guys pull jobs for me all over town disguised as a monster
but it still wasnt enough
and when i saw all those coo coo berries being delivered every day i guess i just lost my head
i figured with the woca sap in the fibremix the berry juice as superfluous
ill tell you whats superfluous lava
so why dont we remove it
he leaps snarling on top of lava
fred and barney pull them apart
then more falling dust and beams give everyone more pressing problems rescue vehicles and police cars roar up slam to a halt cat sirens wailing
the rescue workers jump out
firefighters carry circular trampolines of hide stitched to bamboo frames others go to the back of their trucks and start to turn cranks on the hook and ladder trucks to
raise the ladders
its actually a wheeled carriage carrying a firesaurus which is a critter with a very tiny body and an incred ibly long neck
the bony plates on the creatures back make perfect stairs
however the creature is noticeably listless and uncooperative
come on come on whats the hold up
its the kibble crisis sir the firesauruses have been on half rations for a month
above them the building shudders again
now the remaining light fixtures crash down
when they hit the floor the oil lamps inside spills and fire spreads
theres a fire hose
indeed its on the back wall in a closed box marked fire hose in case of emergency break glass
fred and barney take a step towards it but the fire quickly spreads and cuts them off
helpless they step back
with a thunderous roar the two slate scrapers visible through whats left of the picture window collapse
then the big statue of slate just outside the window begins to decompose
it falls in on itself like a sand sculpture in a storm
finally for a split second it is well life sized and then the head of the statue snaps loose crashes through the only remaining pane of glass here rolls up
to slates feet
everyone looks at everyone else
this is it titanic time
fred embraces wilma
barney embraces betty
their kids are pulled into the clinch
even slate takes mrs
talk about grace under pressure
and speaking of the star fashion model suddenly her fibrethread costume decomposes leaving her in her cute little animal print undies
in the middle of going down with the ship she turns bam bams face away from this display
d dad are we gonna be okay
pause false smile sure pal
we just gotta wait for the fire department
everythings gonna be just whoa hoo hah aggh
hes started yelping because hes realized his arm is on fire and now he jumps up and the others begin beating at the arm with anything in their hands and
then fred suddenly pushes away from them stands there with a small flame flickering on his forearm like a rock vegas stage magician
wait a minute i dont feel anything at all with his other claw he slaps tentatively at the flames and then confidentially snuffs it out
it must be the suit fred old bedrock high built them things to last fred looks over at the wall of flame separating the guests from the fire hose
as everyone gets the same idea dino rushes up the costume head in his mouth
barney helps fred with the head twists it into place
rapping on the head okay
hist hust fine
he lowers his head runs through the fire which licks at him harmlessly
then with his claw he smashes the amber glass a big pythonsaurus is curled up inside snoring
note to herpetologists the pythonosaurus is not quite a snake it has little vestigial forepaws the better to emote with
right now the snoring head is in those little paws
the pythonsaurus stirs looks at fred sniffs the smoke
then he raises one hand and finger as if to say one moment
then the pythonsaurus turns his head towards a nozzle like the ones in hamster cages slurps loudly
we hear gallons and gallons of water gurgling away
everyone retreats from the fire
slate picks up the head of the statue his only souvenir
waiting impatiently until the pythonsaurus finally finishes drinking
it wipes its mouth daintily with a napkin slaps a little fire helmet on its head turns and runs back into the other room
behind him yards and yards of pythonsaurus unroll from a hidden compart ment behind the box
water shoots out of the creatures mouth
fred turns in a semi circle and puts out every lick of flame in the room
all the guests cheer rush forward and slap fred on the back
pebbles jumps up on him and kisses him
hit fuzz nudding
the pythonsaurus looks around at the attention
hey what am i chopped liver
come on everybody well go out the way we came
barney squirts a pathway with his flit gun solidifying a route in the crumbling fibrerock
then barney and fred stand back nobly wave everyone on into the adjacent fibresphere
pushing and shoving outta the way outta the way women and children first
i mean ah children and women first yeah yeah provided that uh theres room for the women
meanwhile the pythonsaurus gives fred or rather his costume a big look up and down looks toward the camera
hey not bad
wonder if she lives around here
just then fred tilts back the monster head
the pythonsaurus reacts
depressed the pythonsaurus follows the others
fred and barney cross over into the fibresphere
as the do slate needle completely collapses
the slate needle tumbles down taking a big chunk of the fibresphere with it
but the rest of the huge globe stays put
gasp cry out already the first partygoers are sliding down the elevator cable
panicking oh geez were all gonna croak i neva shoulda left far rockaway wilma gives her a big suspicious look blanching the headmistress slides down the cable the rescue teams
catch the people in nets as they hit the ground
barney gives the dwindling circle of solid fibre around the group another shot of coo coo juice
poindexter lava pushes his way forward
to anyone and everyone fifty clams for a piggy back ride a hundred clams
aghast do you see that jerry
do you see how my great nephew is behaving at this moment of crisis
real chip off the old block aint he
slate grabs the kid by the neck practically throws him at the cable
she follows him down followed by lava and mr
fred and barney have bravely held up the rear their families clutching to them
barneys carrying bam bam
to pebbles upsy daisy sweetheart piggy back time
she jumps on his back
slamming the monster head back in place
to betty go on honey
i got bam bam
tonight youre the biggest man in bedrock
she kisses him slides down
backlit romantically by the flames just like gable and leigh when atlanta burned
through the mask wilmagh i jusght whunt to sagh thad i knogh shumtimes i dogh dumb thinks
bhut hits becaughse high luff yough sogh much thaght high whant yough to livgh likge a pwincess orgh a qween cause you reaally arggh rugg aaggg hummmmg higga
oh fred thats the most beautiful thing ive ever heard
she drops to safety
wilma slides into a rescue net gets on unsteady feet next to betty
lhets dogh it
their kids on their backs fred and barney exchange a heroic forearm to forearm gladiator type handshake
both put their hands on the cable
and then the whole pulley mechanism falls right down between them and through the hole
a second later the entire remaining structure collapses
everyone reacts in horror dust and smoke clear
when we can see again well its not a pretty sight
the entire fibresphere is gone
all thats left teetering on two spindly supports are two tiny islands of safety connected by a twisted maze of rubble too small for a human to negotiate
and all thats holding that up is a long guide wire leading to the ground
figures on one of the islands stir fred
the platform shudders again
barney aims the flit gun empty
the dads hold on to the kids
its all they can do
wilma and betty gasp
what can be done
bricks and chunks of fibre stir
a form sits up
he looks around at the situation becomes agitated
he wants to help
suddenly become inspired
those hoops of bamboo
do you think
betty we have to try it
dino look down here
obeys puzzled amazingly they grab scraps of wood borrow fire fighters helmets and begin to do a buck and wing
you can keep the twist the frug and hop i dont need to shimmy i dont need to bop music comes up dramatically as he catches on
his eyes fill with courage and he charges toward the spindly bridge that leads to his master and friends
dino dives through the hoops of bamboo duplicating his steps in the dino dance
he reaches the other island
without a beat still keeping time he puts the two kids on his shoulders just like in the dance
then he presents his tail to fred fred hands his tail to barney and then dino slides down the long wire carrying everyone to safety
they all plow into the biggest rescue net as wilma and betty wind up
yes i dont need to shimmy i dont need to bop cause im doin doin doin
rolls out of the net and away from the others
hes slightly stunned still in the suit
he sits up
suddenly lights snap on all around him
fred looks up and sees all with weapons aimed right at him
spotlights on the police car roofs actually little fires with parabolic mirrors are operated by uniformed monkeys
feldspar is at the head of the group
he cocks his shotgun
the elastic catapults at the hammers twitch menacingly its the xenosaurus stand back men its a vicious killer ready aim with desperate poignancy high ham noght a zenosore
high ham hay hooman beeng
bullets and projectiles begin slamming all around fred
he ducks behind a big fallen chunk of fibrerock catches his breath as the bullets and shells bounce off its resilient surface
momentarily safe he tries desperately to remove that stupid head bangs it against the wall tears at it with his claws meanwhile the chunk of fibrerock protecting him decomposes
hes back in the line of fire
flanked by wilma barney and the kids who are shouting for the police to stop only dino the wonder bronto has the wits to act
yi yi yi ing he races forward camera following and with lightning reflexes grabs the seat of freds monster suit and de pants him
instantly dino whirls fred around points to the now revealed striped undershorts
then officer gravel takes a good look at that rear end
hey those are the biggest shorts ive ever seen
it must be mister flintstone
to feldspar gee sarge now you dont have to shoot him
now fred confirms gravels hunch as the costume head finally pops off
all the cops lower their guns
strangely though feldspar still continues to raise his gun even aims
then an alarmed gravel wrestles it away from his superior
safe they all emotionally embrace
fred even suffers dinos affection
in the b
a police car holding piltdown pyrite and lava drives past
poindexter lava is chasing the car
can i use the porscherock while youre in the slammer
suddenly the slates push their way into the group hug
i dont know what to say
i treated you horribly
i ignored you abused you
and then you come here and risk your necks like this
well theres no price you can put on something like that so i wont even try
but let me give you
with great poignancy a hearty handshake
dear dont you think a little more than that is in order
honey youre being hysterical go lie down okay
i am not being hysterical i am being fair now the flintsteins and rabbles saved all of our lives not to mention your reputation
sighing okay okay
to fred and barney boys im feeling guilty about how youve been taken advantage of so ill tell you what
im going to give you back all world wide rights to fibrerock free and clear
he picks up a fragment of stone begins writing on it
your only obligation will be to cover oh whatever legal expenses might surface at some later time
you think theres gonna be some
slate looks around at smoking desolation as far as the eye and camera can see
as we watch the last remaining fragment of slate city collapse crushing a police car
casually oh you never know
several sniff at the air look curiously at a nearby pile of crumbled fibrerock
one and then another shuffles over tentatively tastes some
and digs in
seeing this the firesauruses crane out their necks also begin chowing down on the pile of fibrerock crumbs
all turn at the growing sound of the animals pigging out
now dino yi yi yis past this group and leaps into the pile munching like crazy
barney puts out his hand as chunks of fibrerock shower down like rain from the feeding frenzy
catching some pieces he nibbles on it a little
whats going on
sniffing it lava lava leaves
all still there but now the nutrients are all released
realizing fred this
this is dino kibble
disbelieving fred moves over to the happily munching animals
he has to get on his knees to wiggle in with the pack
he grabs some stuffs it in his mouth
his eyes widen
mouth full dhinough khibble
he spits it out takes out the chunk of contract slate wrote on
barney we were rich
yabba dabba do
faints dead away
the camera pulls back
were back where we began
as the end appears on the drive in screen cars are streaming out of the drive in theatre
the flintstone car is among them
fred and company roll into a s style drive in restaurant
a sign advertises bronto burgers and ribs
a pretty carhop on stone roller skates glides over
fred holds up one finger towards her
she nods scampers o
fred rubs his hands and licks his lips with antici pation
and then the girl returns with a massive rack of ribs on a car tray
she hooks it on the edge of the drivers door
and the entire car tips over with a crash
widen from the mailbox
fred and family pull up
dino runs in first followed by wilma with pebbles already asleep on her shoulder
fred follows the saber tooth cat on his heels
fred stops in the doorway to put a milk bottle on the doorstep and then puts the cat down beside it
he shuts the door
quick as a flash the cat leaps through the side window
the door opens and the cat puts fred out then slams the door
fred recovers from his shock tries the door
well have a yabba dabba do time a dabba do time well have a gay old time
another knock wilma
camera cranes up widens as fred becomes a tiny sil houette banging on the door
