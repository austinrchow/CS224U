if this is the american dream do me a favor and wake me up
the traffic loop outside the terminals is gridlocked mostly with stretch limousines
inside the airport is done up with festive posters streamers and banners welcome pacific partners summit a planeload of cheerful chinese delegates come into the crowded terminal
some sport red t shirts with a picture of mao wearing mickey mouse ears
they get onto the people mover passing by a tv reporter to tv camera eager to mend its tarnished image los angeles has really put out the welcome mat for
the city promises quite a party as leaders from japan china south korea australia the u
and others begin talks for the largest free trade treaty in history
the scene changes to tape of delegates from other countries arriving
then we see massive security preparations all around the city
continuing the one sour note is north korea the only pacific rim country not participating
there are rumors of secret meetings with north korean representatives but u
officials insist the north must first hold democratic elections and halt its nuclear weapons program as they claimed to have done back in
we cut to a heated debate in the un security council
then artillery fire over the korean dmz
the scene returns to lax
continuing tensions remain high since last years skirmishes between north korea and the u
so any chance of the communist north joining the pacific partners seems highly unlikely
an exclusive walled off section of hancock park
theres only one route in and out past a manned guardhouse on wilshire
a colonial style mansion surrounded by an imposing wrought iron fence
there is a bronze plaque in english and korean next to the entranceway consulate of the democratic peoples republic of korea the driveway gate opens and a long black mercedes
with tinted windows and diplomatic license plates glides out
an alert north korean corporal watches the perimeter monitors
he pushes a switch to close the gate behind the mercedes
from atop a pole outside the south wall a man with binoculars overlooks the private streets of fremont place
as the mercedes cruises through the quiet neighborhood
the man paul javal is thirtyish nervous with short sandy hair
he takes the binoculars away from his face and we see his eyes theyre a strange unnaturally light gray
javal takes an orange pill from an unlabeled prescription bottle and pops it into his mouth
he climbs down the pole to a van with a phone company logo on it
the mercedes comes out of the fremont place gate and turns into the heavy morning traffic
it is extremely quiet due to inch thick glass on the windows and pounds of armor plating on the cars chassis
the driver is a north korean army major
on the seat beside him is an amd a
x mm caliber machine gun
a hand from the back seat darts between the front seats and turns on the radio to a rock station
the driver turns it off
the hand belongs to year old sam ke han
sam sits back and sighs to his sister joy
between them sits a middle aged scandinavian governess
i cant stand it half an hour to get to the stupid school every morning
with no music
korean subtitled just our damn nanny
javals van also with tinted windows turns onto crenshaw
it follows the mercedes several cars behind it
javal wired drums on the steering wheel while driving
he glances at some expertly constructed radio control remote units sitting on the seat next to him
traffic is moving at about mph
the mercedes merges onto the freeway heading west
javals van follows
the thumping of a rap song rattles the other drivers fillings as a lowrider with its stereo turned up to cruises by
even watts of bass cannot penetrate the armored silence
the driver scans the road wary but sensing no danger
he puts on his blinker to take the south exit
the van follows now directly behind the mercedes in a procession of vehicles going up the long curved overpass arcing feet above the toward the
as they approach the crest of the overpass javal flips a switch on his radio control unit
six small semicircles exact replicas of the stay alert bumps on the white lines of the overpass explode
they spew hundreds of sharp triangular nails across the roadway
immediately scores of tires on passing cars blow out
causing yards ahead of the mercedes and van the most hellacious gut wrenching piss your pants chain reaction pile up you can imagine
dozens of drivers lose control of their vehicles
sideswipe their neighbors
grind against the guard rails
some fishtail into s smashing headlong into the traffic still coming onto the overpass
brakes squeal people scream metal crumples airbags deploy glass shatters
and then it gets really nasty
a honda gets jammed under a truck hauling cinder blocks
the truck jackknifes tipping over like a drunken giant
it smashes through the concrete wall and guard rail
along with several cars and their screaming occupants swept over the edge by the truck like discarded soda cans
they plummet through space crashing onto the freeway below
sam joy and the governess brace themselves as the driver slams on the brakes
he barely avoids hitting anything
korean stay in the car
a nightmare scene of smoke twisted wrecks dazed victims
the mercedes and van sit motionless in the backed up traffic
javal slides open a trap door on the floor of the van
he slips a wheeled mechanics repair platform through it
as unnoticed amid the chaos he lies on the platform and rolls under the mercedes
the undercarriage of the mercedes is armored with steel
javal stops at a patch of perforations an air exchange vent
he attaches a slim device over the vent flips a switch on it then rolls back toward the van
oblivious to javals actions below them everyone watches as police and news helicopters circle above
then some chp motorcycles straddle the lanes and zoom by
sweating javal sits back in the drivers seat and checks another radio unit
the chp has cleared a path through the devastation and traffic trickles through
as the mercedes and the van pass by javal looks proudly at the misery hes wrought
he follows the mercedes onto the south
javal drives behind the mercedes with one hand on the radio unit
the mercedes signals to take the venice exit
javal fingers the radio unit itching to use it
but he passes by the mercedes as it gets off the freeway
javals device is armed and waiting
a pretty street in the miracle mile lined with neat single family homes
timed sprinkler systems water some of the yards
every house on the block except the one were in front of has a for sale sign on the lawn
from the weathered looks of the signs theyve been there for quite a while
its a hot night
the ceiling fan above the bed spins slowly
pete carson tosses restlessly in bed the sheets half covering him
next to him his wife miranda knoll snores contentedly
carson is in his late thirties outdoorsy with a tight muscular build
emotionally hes tightly wound as well
miranda is raven haired sensible pretty
she believes above all else that one should never raise ones voice
quick silent images a street cordoned off with police tape
cops swat teams fbi surround beverly thrift a bank
carson younger hair shorter sits in an fbi command truck across from the bank
covering the mouthpiece of the phone in his hand hes arguing with the other agents in the truck
suddenly a huge fiery explosion blows out the front of the bank building
horrified carson runs toward it
carson is snapped awake by a car alarm going off outside
son of a bitch
he bolts out of bed wearing nothing but a pair of striped bikini briefs
miranda rolls over sleepy unconcerned
we have to be up early tomorrow
call the police
he races down the hall right past the house alarm keypad its lcd reading armed
he grabs an aluminum baseball bat from the umbrella stand
forgetting to disarm the house alarm he yanks the front door open
the house alarm begins shrieking
pulls the pillows over her head and sighs
carson comes around to the driveway which is illuminated by the streetlight where two ish assholes are sitting in his mustang convertible their presence courtesy of a huge cut theyve
made in the otherwise perfect ragtop
car theft tools in a leather case between them theyre prying the ignition switch out of the dashboard
asshole spots carson
he gets out of the car wielding a crowbar
his partner keeps working
asshole lunges viciously swiping at carson with the crowbar taking a piece out of his side
carson starts bleeding profusely but hes too pissed to notice
carson uses his bat to take the offensive
they go at each other like combatants in a swordfight the clanking of metal echoing through the neighborhood along with the screaming house and car alarms and frantic neighborhood dogs
surprised at carsons fury and strength asshole backs onto the lawn oblivious to the running sprinklers
as he backs away his shoe catches on one of the sprinkler heads
it breaks off and a huge geyser of water sprays out
carson holds his bat in both hands and jams the front of it into asshole s breadbasket
he doubles over
carson grabs asshole s arm and pulls it quickly against his raised knee
there is a snap and a loud howl as the arm breaks and carson tosses him aside
seeing this asshole gives up on the car
he takes off toward the street
carson runs to head him off but hes a lot faster in his air jordans than carson is in his bare feet
carson grabs the metal lid from a garbage can at the curb and flings it like a huge frisbee
it sails across the street and nails asshole s head
he kisses the pavement stunned
carson runs up and grabs him but he pulls out a long sharp screwdriver and jabs at carson with it
then blue flashing lights appear from around the corner a westec chevy blazer
two uniformed guards get out and fumble with their sidearms
on the ground
asshole is still trying to gouge carson with the screwdriver
carson glares at the dopey guards
asshole was trying to boost my car
carsons fiftyish black next door neighbor wearing pajamas and a robe comes out of his house
carson sees him
has a cordless phone its busy
to guards re carson hes the good guy you schumcks
the guards seem to get it
without warning one takes out a taser and zaps asshole
carson lets go just in time
holding his bleeding side carson walks back to his house
he notices the neighborhood watch sign has graffiti spray painted on it
he touches it the paint is still wet
his neighbor shrugs whatta ya gonna do
the paper guy drives by
and tosses carsons newspaper right under the gushing sprinkler
i hate this fuckin town
joy is standing on the toilet blowing cigarette smoke into the exhaust fan
someone knocks on the door
she flicks the cigarette into the toilet puts a zippo lighter in her pocket
joy opens the bathroom door
sam is standing there grinning
there are six bathrooms in this house sam
fanning the air but only one with a smoking section
she quickly closes the door behind her
sam and joy sit at the table
ambassador han and mrs
han are having breakfast radish soup kimchi and grilled fish
ambassador han reads through the mornings faxed communiques
hes rarely smiles and hates living in the u
hes dressed in an impeccably tailored valentino two piece suit
han is slender soft spoken but as iron willed as her husband
she however is quick to smile
shes wearing a summery dress with a white sweater over her shoulders
ambassador han pulls the front of sams shirt to reveal the nirvana logo on his t shirt
korean go change
ambassador hans x ray stare turns to joy
continuing you smell like a fireplace
a butler appears with a phone
he whispers to mrs
its the governess
into phone hello hilda
as she speaks into a cellular phone
shes extremely nervous
we cannot see her surroundings
thru phone mrs
i am very sick today
into phone we will see you next week
hangs up smiles to kids it appears ill be taking you to school
in the back of his van javal pats the governess hand
you may go now
he speaks with a slight accent french perhaps
he pops an orange pill then unlatches the rear doors of the van
with a quick glance back at him she goes to open the doors
javal grabs a plastic tarp and throws it over the governess upper body
he puts his arm across her neck flicks open a gravity knife and plunges it through the tarp into her chest
he drops her on the floor of the van and fastidiously wipes a small smudge of blood from his hand with a handkerchief
carson steps out of the shower
he looks exhausted
toweling off he goes into the bedroom where miranda is riding an exercise bike listening to music on headphones and reading the sprinkler soaked newspaper all while watching the tv
a perky blonde traffic reporter bobbi marchfelder talks to us from a local news copter
on tv good morning summit day
its gonna be the super bowl the th of july the olympics and woodstock all rolled into one
all over town therell be parades concerts rallies festivals

we cut to the white house lawn where the president is about to board a helicopter
on tv the president is on his way
on tv its an honor hosting my fellow leaders in los angeles the capitol city of the pacific rim
we cut back to the studio and the morning anchor
on tv well see the menu for mayor simpsons brentwood barbecue right after this
we cut to a musical montage of preparations for the events around town
as the music swells carson turns the tv off
i was watching that
if i hear one more beach boys song ill shoot myself
miranda points at the headphones she cant hear him
continuing while smiling i said if we were having sex once in a while you wouldnt need to ride that fucking bike every morning
hasnt heard a thing be right with you
as carson dresses we get a look at their bedroom mirandas nightstand has two neat stacks of periodicals on it with los angeles magazine and psychology today on the top
carsons nightstand is overflowing with books and magazines about other cities and states wonderland washington magnificent oregon welcome to north carolina
miranda dressed in a conservative skirt jacket black shoes is out on the patio
her breakfast a bowl of fruit and wheat germ sits on the patio table while she waters some sickly looking rose bushes in a planter
carson dressed in shirt and tie looking beat fries a steak and three eggs in butter
he comes outside with his breakfast and a magazine article american expatriates in new zealand
looks him over have you gotten any sleep lately
ignores the question shops gonna tow the car in goddamn ignitions trashed
ill ride in with diane
carson watches as she carefully picks the dead leaves off the rose bushes
you ask me those suckers are a lost cause
she continues then glances at the article carson is reading
its not for you
you mean its not for you
i dont chase car thieves in my underwear
cmon youd die of boredom if we ever sold this house and moved
id die of shock from finding anyone dumb enough to buy the place
even for what its worth now
lots of people bought at the top of the market
that sure cheers me right up
i dont know why we even talk about it
the citys not the problem
so we move
it wouldnt matter
whats that saying wherever you go there you are
carson just looks at her
reaching for the salt he winces from the cut in his side
continuing i hope youre current on your tetanus booster
was it worth it
two assholes in the hospital
carson glances at his watch and gets up
continuing well another day of baby sitting my favorite bunch of people
he grabs a bianchi shoulder holster with a sig sauer p mm pistol straps it on then pulls on a blue windbreaker
emblazoned on the back are large yellow letters fbi
ask for a transfer
theyre not gonna transfer me
you know damn well why i was bumped down to guard duty
as hes leaving my outstanding people skills
miranda tries to return to tending her roses
but instead she sadly watches him go
a look of sorrow crosses carsons face as he watches some young kids laugh and shove getting onto a school bus
he then glances at his wounded mustang parked in the street
he spots something on the windshield a pink parking ticket
the parking sign above the graffiti stained neighborhood watch sign reads street cleaning friday am
i hate this fuckin town
carson chirps open mirandas car a red volvo
as he pulls away we see a bumper sticker on the car a circle and slash through cartoon weapons on one side cartoon teddy bears on the other and arms
are for hugging in between
the driver backs the mercedes out of the garage behind the consulate
we notice there is another mercedes parked inside
han sam and joy come outside
they hear some heartfelt goddamn limey overpriced piece a shit
in the driveway across the street a man in a business suit has his head under the hood of a brand new jaguar convertible
the jag owners year old blonde daughter lisa sits in the car with her schoolbooks in her lap
turns to mrs
han can we give lisa a ride
it pulls into the driveway across the street
the jag owner is still swearing mightily
lisa climbs into the mercedes
joy rolls the window up and the sound of cursing disappears
continuing excellent i cant hear him
raps on window the glass is an inch thick
points to doors roof armor plated
perfect car for l
looks back at her dad starts too
as the mercedes travels its usual route down crenshaw javals van begins following it
where javals device is attached still waiting
a dark green government dodge pulls up and parks behind one just like it on a paved area near the consulate gate
dave juarez chubby mexican american a desk jockey gets out of the dodge and hangs an fbi shield over his top pocket
he glances over at north korean security chief colonel lee who has paused inside the gate to regard dave and the outside world with profound contempt
dave attache case in one hand and notebook computer in the other walks to a by detached guardhouse on the far corner of the property just outside the high fence
inside are two desks and four chairs a console of communication equipment a microwave and a mr
two fbi agents finishing their shift gather their belongings robbins late s male thinning hair and sabatini early s cute dark bobbed hair female

he glances through the window at colonel lee
continuing whos the fuckin gargoyle
their chief of security colonel lee

some creeps tried to rip off his mustang last night
beat solemnly they cut the ragtop
dave takes three pcmcia computer cards from his attache case
continuing latest and greatest
wireless network link ups
whoa slow down im gonna pee
the van drives in the lane alongside the mercedes
humming javal drives with one hand while tapping with his other on the top of the radio controlled remote box
as they approach the light at washington blvd just turning yellow javals van gets in front of the mercedes
their lanes stop for the red light
a fruit vendor holding a bag of oranges walks from car to car
javal slips the van into neutral and lets it roll back until his rear bumper taps gently against the mercedes front bumper
the driver hits the horn
the van doesnt move
the driver glances in the rear view theres a jeep cherokee tight on his tail and the black lady in it is busy dealing with a carpool full of year
the driver looks at mrs
han whos peering out the side window fascinated by the african american themed storefronts
theyre all festooned with summit related banners and shop owners are preparing for a community sidewalk bazaar
sam bored stuffs several pieces of gum into his mouth
javal flips the switch on his radio controlled remote
under the mercedes the device javal planted there begins to emit thick white cs tear gas
the gas pours in through the ventilation system
everyone inside starts coughing and choking uncontrollably
the driver grabs his amd machine gun and pops the door locks
the driver mrs
han joy sam and lisa pile out of the car
jittering with excitement fear and speed javal hops out of his van holding a benelli m a semi automatic shotgun
he shoots the driver in the chest
the blast from the shotgun muzzle however is unlike anything weve ever seen before it is blindingly bright even in broad daylight belching a huge cluster of glowing white hot
the driver flies back against the mercedes emptying his machine gun into the air
the wound in his chest is full of burning magnesium shrapnel
the other drivers in the intersection see this and go completely nuts
some duck for cover under their dashboards
others peel away
a few collide with oncoming traffic
the carpool lady in the cherokee pushes the kids down on the floor
the fruit vendor hides by rolling under a car
sam and joy are incapacitated by tear gas coughing fits
han stumbles toward them trying to get them to run away
javal punches her knocking her down
he turns to lisa surprised to see her
sweating he points the shotgun at her
almost pulls the trigger
then notices mrs
hans expression of horror and thinks the better of it
he spots a motorist in a ford escort peering cautiously over his dashboard to get a look at the action
javal shoots the motorist through the windshield with another bright searing blast of magnesium
the motorist and the entire front of his car burst into flames
han is on her knees sobbing
javal grabs her by the arm and pulls her to the back of the van
he opens the doors
you see that im serious in my intention yes
she nods if you cooperate you and your children will be home for dinner tonight
he tightens his grip on her
she nods again then looks at the kids
javal shoves her sam joy and lisa into the van
he grabs three pairs of handcuffs off a c shaped bar welded on both ends to the inside of the van
he handcuffs one of mrs
hans arms passes the chain through the bar then handcuffs the other
he does the same with sam then handcuffs one of joys arms passes the chain through and attaches the other handcuff to lisa
javal hops in his seat and drives away on washington
several people including the carpool lady rush over to the driver who lies dead and smoldering on the ground
his hand is halfway inside his bloody pants pocket holding a small plastic card with the consulates phone number on it
colonel lee and a north korean army officer come running out
another officer starts up a car in the back of the house
robbins and sabatini see the commotion and go to investigate
ambassador han runs out
he has a stricken look on his face
korean to ambassador han you must stay here
ambassador han nods
the fbi agents run up
to them someone took my family
the agents look at each other holy shit
colonel lees car screeches to a stop
sabatini stands in front of it
you got no jurisdiction outside this property
colonel lee shoves a big ugly tokorev
x mm caliber pistol in her face as hes opening the car door
to ambassador han yank his fuckin leash
my men are going
colonel lee jumps into the car and it screeches away almost running sabatini over
continuing to sabatini its a white telephone van driving west on washington boulevard
the agents rush back to their guardhouse
daves government dodge is blocking theirs
dave tosses them to robbins
sabatini shoves dave into the back seat
he looks at her dumbfounded
youre ridin shotgun
dave is thrown against the back of the seat by the acceleration
under the seat
sabatini grabs the red flashing light puts it on the dashboard
i dont know
im never in a fuckin hurry
just as they race out of fremont place past the guard gate carson in mirandas volvo comes in on the other side
carson sees the agents in the dodge and floors the volvo
he fishtails making a u turn
he straddles the lanes on wilshire to pull up next to them
all the cars in front of them swerve to clear out of the way
he rolls down his window
sabatini shouts over to him someone snatched hans family
white phone van westbound on washington
carson looks like hes been punched in the stomach
give me a secure radio
sabatini takes a small two way motorola radio out of her pocket and throws it through her window to carson
dropping it in his lap he punches the gas
robbins floors daves piece of shit dodge trying to keep up
diplomatic liaison earl walther is using the reflection in his office window to adjust his necktie
walther is good looking black a gs lifer working his way up the ranks by virtue of his quiet competence
a co worker sticks his head into the office then shields his eyes from the sight of walthers sharp new suit
someones been to nordstroms big time
clothes make the man
but does the man make enough for the clothes
smiles the man makes payments on his visa
walthers secretary rushes in
into phone this is diplomatic liaison earl walther
whats the nature of your emer grimaces aw jesus
beat ill inform channels and get a copter in the air
for gods sake keep it quiet
do what you can but dont endanger civilians or the family
carson drives with one hand while holding the radio
into radio you bet nice and easy
real easy until he narrowly misses a bunch of cars when screeching around a corner
walther presses the intercom button on the phone
into phone get the secretary of state on the horn
listens i know he left already
im familiar with the concept of time zones
find his ass
carson turns the frequency on his two way
into radio robbins sabatini
choppers on its way
driving skillfully carson edges past the north koreans
and then carson cant believe it he spots javals van a couple blocks ahead driving at normal speed
into radio check it out
ahead on the right
thru radio think its them
into radio yeah
but it seems too easy
ill move up he wont suspect a civilian car
stay back then get on his ass when i signal
well box him in
he looks over at colonel lee whose car is pacing his
continuing into radio if the mod squad gets in your way dont be shy about getting em out
thru radio copy that one
glaring colonel lee looks over at the fbi cars as they pass
sabatini pulls out her machine pistol and tosses the two way to dave
he looks scared and carsick
i hate when guys puke
carson tries to approach javal without drawing his attention
he still drives at the same speed as the surrounding traffic
as carson nonchalantly passes javal notices the government issue two way radio sitting on the seat of carsons volvo
its show time
he stomps on the gas
pissed that hes been made carson speeds up
driving fast javal makes a hard right
as the van leans with the turn something rolls out from under a sheet of canvas on the floor the governess body bloodied and grotesque under the plastic tarp its
joy starts screaming as does everyone else when they see it
javal pulls out a beretta centurion mm pistol and fires a deafening round through the roof of the van
i need to concentrate
during a lull in traffic a well dressed woman jaywalks across the street
an lapd black and white changes lanes and puts on its flashing lights
as two cops write her a ticket
around the corner two men make a quick exchange of money and a vial of crack
the cops do notice javal speeding by with carsons volvo the fbi dodge and colonel lees car in hot pursuit
they shove the ticket in the well dressed womans hand and hop in their car
javal turns onto the side streets rows of run down apartment buildings
he takes a circuitous route gaining a one block lead on carson and the others
then he makes a sudden turn into a one way alley
javal hits a remote garage door opener
ahead rickety doors on one of a line of detached garages facing the alley open up
across from the garage parked parallel against the back of an empty building we notice a duplicate van
its facing the same direction as javal is driving
javal slams on the brakes stopping just past the garage and then quickly backs up into the garage
as he pulls in we catch glimpses of the van slipping backwards into a fiberglass superstructure that fits tightly around the rear two thirds of it
as the van comes to a stop several snap buckles on the edge of the superstructure spring closed
javal reaches out the van window and pulls on a rope hanging from the ceiling of the garage
the rope releases the door from the opening mechanism so it immediately falls closed
then javal turns several switches on another of his neatly constructed remotes steel straps are holding the steering wheel rigid
a set of relays triggered remotely start the engine engage the transmission and supply fuel to the carburetor
the duplicate van takes off down the alley
just as it gets up to speed carson and the others round the corner into the alley behind it
as far as they know theyre still chasing javal
the alley is several blocks long running parallel to the main road separated at each block by perpendicular streets
the duplicate van races along scraping against parked cars and the rear walls of buildings
into radio hes gonna wrap it around something
indeed as the duplicate van crosses a street cars swerve to avoid hitting it
it continues into the next alley
up ahead a garbage truck lumbers into the far end of the alley its metal lift rods extended to pick up a dumpster
the duplicate van crashes into the garbage truck and explodes
carson horrified jumps out of his car
robbins and sabatini run up
they have to hold carson away from the burning van
dave hurries to the back of a building and gets sick
colonel lee wide eyed with anger gets in carsons face
you should not have interfered
carson shoves colonel lee out of his way hard
im in no mood
colonel lee comes back ready for a fight
carson is happy to oblige but robbins grabs carsons arm
forget about him
by now onlookers have begun to gather as lapd black and whites and helicopters converge on the area
a block away the garage door opens and we hear something eerie and unexpected a scratchy music box kids song coming from a loudspeaker
javals van pulls out and we see its transformation the superstructure surrounding the body of the van makes it look like a graffiti covered unlicensed ice cream vendor
the entrance of the alley is blocked by a black and white
so accompanied by the song javal drives along the one way alley in his camouflaged van passing unnoticed by the authorities
anguished carson is staring at the burning duplicate van
beverly thrift explodes and burns
carson tries to shake the memory away
he looks around sensing that something isnt right then turns to the other agents
lets get back to the consulate
off their perplexed looks we one room bathroom and kitchenette
a laptop computer and peripherals are on a table along with some cell phones a toolbox and some jumbles of electronic circuitry
in the main room there are three large lazy boy easy chairs side by side facing a inch tv on a stand
a cloth covers two objects sitting atop the tv
the door opens
han joy sam and lisa walk in rigid with fear
javal beretta mm in hand comes in behind them and closes the door
javal strips off his sweat soaked shirt and wipes his face with it
han realizes hes wired to the moon
and it terrifies her
does anyone need to use the rest room
this will be your last opportunity for a few hours
no takers very well
han sam joy please sit here
indicates the lazy boys then turns to lisa and you
what is your name
after a beat lisa
still holding the beretta he grabs a polo shirt from the closet and pulls it on
as the family sits in the chairs no mrs
han this one
he takes a pair of handcuffs out of his pants pocket
he tries to handcuff lisa hands behind her back but she resists
continuing sotto you afford me some additional bargaining power
but not much
javal cuffs her to the handles of the refrigerator
he puts a strip of duct tape from his tool box across her mouth
he uncovers one of the items atop the tv an electronic box with three pairs of oversized led vu meters on the front of it
we notice neat lines of wires running from each of the chairs up into it
javal flips one of a row of switches on it a green light and the meters come to life
no taping your mouths no restraints
please remain still while i explain
the meters on the left indicate sound pressure decibels
there are microphones on your chair backs
if you raise your voices above certain level putting your meter in the red zone for more than one sustained second the circuit will be closed
beat the right meters indicate motion
there are pressure sensors inside the armrests and seats
the sensors dont like to get wet so i hope you were honest about not needing to use the loo
if you make any excess movements or try to leave your chair the circuit will be closed
i dont understand
she looks at her sound meter which jumped close to the red
continuing softly what happens if the circuit closes
he uncovers the other item atop the tv a one pound brick of c high explosive with the detonation mechanism jammed into it
han gasps and begins to panic
to the kids do each of you understand
tears roll down joys face
continuing keep your wits and all will be fine
he flips another switch and the green light turns yellow
he then turns on the tv
coverage of the summit is everywhere
on tv not since the olympics has the whole city had an such an opportunity javal turns the channel to a soap and mutes it
he starts pacing and glances at his watch
earl walther looks through the window as his copter lands on the lawn behind the north korean consulate
as the copter lands carson comes out to meet walther
carson nods walther
who told the ambassador
his security chief
beat there was a civilian with them fifteen year old girl from across the street
were trying to reach the parents
sotto look mrs
han was the north korean premiers niece
were hearing rumors theyre gonna make a major issue out of what happened here
carson and walther come into the house
we hear only the ticking of the grandfather clock in the foyer
colonel lee and his officers stand by the stairs robbins sabatini and dave stand together near the front door
im not so sure what happened here
asshole was acting like he wanted us to spot him
what the hell are you talking about
ambassador han comes down the stairs his face tight with repressed emotion
my deepest i have no wish for condolences
as soon as we have any to give
suddenly the butler sprints across the foyer
he shoves the cordless phone into ambassador hans hands
ambassador han listens to the phone then takes in a sharp breath and sits on the steps
into phone yoon
to fbi agents start a trace
carson is elated
robbins sabatini and dave rush out
walther pulls out a cell phone and hits a speed dial key
into phone mr

while crossing to ambassador han yeah you didnt know

javal is holding his cell phone next to mrs
into phone we are not hurt
but this man is very serious he pulls the phone from her takes a breath to compose himself
into phone i want you to remember the feeling you had when you thought your family was dead and use it to inform the choices youre about to make
say you want to talk to the kids
into phone i need to know my children are all right
thru phone be in front of a television in two minutes
tune it to channel four
youll get the picture
javal hangs up
stunned ambassador han stands up
there is a television in my office
as carson ambassador han colonel lee and walther hurry to the office in the back of the house carsons radio crackles thru radio were screwed on the trace hes on
a cell phone
dave and robbins watch sabatini work the comm console
play the tape back
i might be able to pull the electronic serial number out of the subcarrier
thru radio ask dave if he knows how to find the phones serial number
smiles into radio hey great idea
ambassador han turns on the tv to channel
its the same medical soap thats on at the apartment a doctor and nurse are screwing in a deserted operating room
javal is standing in the kitchenette pointing a digital still camera at the family
it flashes as he takes a picture
there is a cable running from javals computer to his cell phone
he hooks another cable to the digital camera and an image appears on the screen of his laptop
he clicks on send
everyone stares expectantly at the tv
they turn as the fax machine on the credenza rings
an image begins to emerge from the machine the picture from javals digital camera
it shows the han family sitting in their booby trapped chairs in front of the tv
the explosives and the electronics are clearly visible atop the set as is the program on the tv
oh jesus thosere explosives
beat look at the tv this was just taken
a second page on the fax begins to come through
as it does the telephone rings
carson and colonel lee both go for the extension near the sofa carson grabs it first
ambassador han picks up the phone on his desk
thru phone there must surely be several people in the room you may put me on the speakerbox if you wish
ambassador han clicks on the speakerbox
carson and the others look at the second faxed page a list of instructions
continuing thru speakerbox i am not a terrorist
your countries political posturing means nothing to me
so do not waste time trying to negotiate
beat the federal reserve bank of los angeles can furnish ten million dollars u
the required denominations are in the instructions as is the method of packaging
be in your car at pm and drive north on highland avenue
i will call with where to leave the money which you will do at
if i am unmolested i will call again at with the familys location and the method for removing them from their
could you please refer to page one
they look at the photo any deviation from these instructions and my device will fulfill its function at exactly pm
ambassador han looks around feeling totally helpless
carson says nothing trying not to show how uneasy he feels
to walther pyungyang must approve the ransom
the fbis top hostage negotiator is on the way goddamn negotiators the last thing we need
this asshole sound like he was interested in bargaining
walther glares at carson then continues to ambassador han we have people who are experts in these situations
we really feel it would be best if you let them coordinate everything
numb ambassador han nods
continuing to carson lets get on it
robbins sabatini and dave look up as carson and walther enter
youre gonna just pay up count on his good nature to return the family
its the presidents intention to keep this quiet move forward with the summit and work with the north koreans
jesus youve already embarrassed the shit out of us over the phone surveillance they know their phones are tapped
they tap our fucking phones
thats not the point
the point is not acknowledging it
beat we got an international incident brewing with a country we were practically at war with last year
our best negotiator is gonna run point
if you got a problem you can take the goddamn rest of the day off
this consulate is my responsibility
not any more
carson is stunned
os we hear a chopper approaching
continuing thats the negotiator
you do the briefing
carson shoots a disgusted look at the others then leaves
carson turns off the beach boys song on the tv behind him
holding javals faxes hes facing ambassador han colonel lee and the hostage negotiator whom we dont yet see
our worst enemyll be the city
there are events gearing up all around town and a dozen world leaders arriving
add the friday rush hour and usual l
bad behavior and itll be a nightmare out there by pm
it all works to the advantage of the kidnapper hinders our pursuit efforts
frowns you dont agree
the negotiator stands and takes the faxes from carson
its miranda his wife
her fbi shield holder is folded over the breast pocket of her jacket
im wondering whether to believe him when he says hes strictly motivated by money
grabs faxes back you see one word of peoples liberation holy jihad revolutionary whatever it is were pissed off about this week bullshit in this entire letter
i still want to check the mo against known politicals terrorists already doing it
were coordinating with the secret service the nsa and the cia
have someone talk to the lapd give them a cover story for the media about the crash on la cienega
walther comes in and looks at carson
why didnt you tell me doctor knoll is your wife
this surprises ambassador han and colonel lee
while looking at miranda if shed changed her name when we got married i wouldnt have to
to carson im so enjoying this opportunity to finally work together
jesus forget i asked
beat the cash will be here in an hour
to miranda any thoughts on the kidnappers thoughts
everything indicates hes working alone
and his concerns do seem to be solely about the money
so i agree that hes only using the summit and the tension with north korea to create extreme motivation to pay the ransom
i will bring the money to him
the hostages are citizens of the peoples republic of korea hey do i go to the torture chambers in your prisons tell you how to do your job
all right youre outta here
is this the same insubordinate crap you pulled at beverly thrift
carson glares coldly at walther
ill coordinate the drop
perhaps that is better
inspector carson knows the terrain then he can come with me
walther looks at miranda
she nods her assent
firm to carson its settled
but it means we can get on with it
the americans leave the room
still fuming carson walks ahead
miranda pulls walther aside
sotto get one thing straight mr
if the bureau had listened to pete beverly thrift never wouldve happened
hands shaking with nerve and speed induced jitters javal turns two switches on the unit atop the tv
two led readouts light up one shows the current time pm the other is fixed at pm
below the tv is still on
javal flips the channels stopping at a rerun of lifestyles of the rich and famous
he suppresses a gleeful giggle
thats more like it
he checks the contents of his prescription bottle
he takes one stuffs the bottle in his pocket and leaves
piy ngyang north korea day super piyungyang
capitol of north korea
poster city for the charms of communism dreary crumbling gray stifling hopeless
in the main government offices a meeting of ten overly decorated military men and their support staffs
sour general kai s is arguing heatedly in korean with an aged moderate general
the weak willed premier of north korea sits up front and listens passively
an army major sitting behind general kai stands and slips out the door
crouched behind an air conditioning unit the major an american operative speaks in unaccented english into a small uplink device disguised to look like a palmtop computer
into uplink device theyve got the premier agreeing to the hard line position he hears footsteps approaching os
continuing sotto more to follow
he angles skyward a tiny dish shaped antenna on the device
on its screen it says compressing
after its finished the operative snaps it closed and puts it into a false bottom in his attache case
he disappears just before a guard rounds the corner
welcome pacific partners banners hang everywhere
workers and caterers prepare for the various parties and events around town
cops and private security do their best to keep traffic moving but its already getting congested
dave stares at his computer looking through a database of kidnappers and their modus operandi
he rubs his eyes
i wanted to be home by now take the kids to the rally in boyle heights
we got a cabin in big bear
by now l
was supposed to be a brown blotch in the rear view mirror
shes helping walther stack packs of thousand dollar bills into a series of small plastic bags tying each one off when its the size of a brick
they then put the individual bags into two larger bags
robbins rubber bands a matchbook sized homing transmitter in between two packs of cash
he then hollows out a dime sized space inside a different pack of money with a razor knife
he puts a tiny second homing transmitter in the space
carson checks some hand held receivers
miranda crosses to him
hell expect a homing device i expect him to expect it
hell check the cash with an rf detector
re larger transmitter meaning hell find this one
re smaller transmitter this only has a quarter mile range but on a frequency too low to detect
turns off receiver and i doubt the asshole will have an x ray machine or a metal detector
why must you always refer generically to criminals as assholes
gosh youre right
it could undermine their self esteem and spoil their chances for rehabilitation
you been reading my magazines in the bathroom again
she returns to listening to an audio tape thru recorder and my device will fulfill its function at exactly pm
hes really exhibiting pressured speech
big effort here to sound calm
same with his vocabulary
if he were in control he wouldnt feel such a need to sound that way
just tell me if we can use it
if we needle him he could get sloppy and give us an opening but im not going to risk it
this is the worst kind of perpetrator anything makes him deviate from his carefully scripted plan he could become extremely volatile
during this colonel lee stands in a window on the top floor pointing a laser eavesdropping unit at the fbi guardhouse
thru headphones do we have back up if the bleeper fails
thru headphones nothing but physical surveillance
its real important we dont lose him
he didnt go through all the trouble of designing that bomb not to use it
carson looks at her as the thought of it hits him
well it aint gonna happen
beat sotto not again
the national security council vice president secretaries of defense state chiefs of the fbi cia and nsa sit nervously around a table facing a video conferencing setup
the president in air force one appears on it
thru video link what the hell is the big crisis
we just received a missive from the north korean attache
they say the kidnapping is a u
plot to provoke and humiliate them during the summit
thru video link bullshit
theyre just ticked because we dont want the chinese dragging their asses into the treaty talks
the senior intelligence officer refers to his notes
we have a covert operative in place
he reports the hard liners and moderates in the high command are arguing about how to respond should the premiers niece and her children should be killed
scowls thru video link respond
what about the damn premier
he has to look tough to save face keep control of hard liners
otherwise he risks a coup
which is a real possibility
most of those old fart generals dont want to more cia chief contd be part of the summit any more than we want them to
theyre mad as hell he even talked to the chinese
thru video link i dont want to deal with this right now
get our diplomats on it
tell the north well pay the ransom for em
and make damn sure we get that family back in one piece
whos in charge in l
the bureau sir
we have a crack team in place
theres a diplomatic liaison from state too
to fbi chief what about your man stationed at the consulate
refers to notes carson
he was demoted from the fbi hostage program couple years back
and this did happen on his watch
irritated theres no way he couldve prevented this abduction
besides ive got one of my top negotiators in charge thru video link whatever
i want a total news blackout and i want this over with quickly
without giving those commie little bastards any excuse to shit all over my summit
inside the grandfather clock in the foyer chimes three times
colonel lee carrying an amd machine gun goes to get in the drivers side of the second armored mercedes but carson is already there
grumbling he crosses to the passengers side
carson drives off just a moment before colonel lee is completely in the car
the mercedes crosses melrose going into hollywood
the town is all done up with posters and banners
robbins and walther follow a block behind the mercedes in an unmarked car sabatini and dave drive ahead in daves dodge
miranda ambassador han and lisas father the cussing jag owner wait by the phone
miranda smiles reassuringly at the two nervous fathers
the phone rings she picks it up
into phone yes please go ahead
long beat thru phone ah
this must be one of those professionals into phone im only here to see that everyone gets what they want thru phone ive got my shotgun in little lisas mouth
and i will pull the trigger in five seconds unless you put the ambassador on the phone
miranda hands the phone to ambassador han
from the two way radio in carsons pocket thru radio the drop is at the demille barn across from the hollywood bowl
youre to leave the money in the center of the parking lot
into radio shit
no way we can set up a stake out in
more carson contd checks watch four minutes
call the park rangers at the bowl
have them clear the area of civilians
thru radio remember pete
were dealing with a customer with a lot of rage
to himself mustve bought a house same time we did
robbins and walther are inching along in traffic on highland near hollywood blvd
elsewhere we see unmarked police and government cars cruising around dropping off disguised foot surveillance officers etc
of twenty aging weekend warriors all on custom harleys turn from the boulevard onto highland
carson drives the mercedes into the entrance of the hollywood museum park
carson stops in front of a yellow barn with a sign atop it jesse lasky famous players
still disguised as an ice cream truck the van is parked across highland by the entrance to the hollywood bowl where a summit related concert is being readied
javal watches the mercedes and takes his last pill
colonel lee grabs the two large plastic bags full of money from the back seat opens his door and drops them onto the pavement
carson looks around
into radio theres about a hundred ways he can scurry off like a cockroach from here
so spread out
colonel lee checks their beeping homing receiver
carson hangs a left onto highland going back the way he came
dave holds their homing receiver
sabatini behind the wheel smacks his arm and points ahead javals van drives into the parking lot and stops right above the bags of money
into radio our boys in a fuckin ice cream truck
sabatini and dave watch javals van through the trees
javal sweating and shaking quickly runs a metal detector wand over each of the individual bags of money
one of them makes the speaker in the wand handle whine
the van pulls away
dave glances at the homing receiver
the signal isnt moving
he looks up
two of the small bags of money are sitting on the pavement
son of a bitch
into radio he found the bleepers both of them
into radio fuck
okay stay back
its not like hell be hard to see in that truck
which ways he heading
thru radio toward the freeway
carson hangs a u turn
at the complex intersection where highland ends at the javal bears to the right toward the south on ramp
sabatini and dave follow a few cars behind as he gets on it
suddenly he scoots over to the shoulder and slams the van into reverse
he backs off the on ramp past a row of angry drivers passing by sabatini and dave
peeling in reverse onto highland javal stomps on the brakes
the snap buckles holding the ice cream truck superstructure around his van break apart and the whole thing slides off
blocking sabatinis way
javal drives forward again this time getting onto the north on ramp
miranda looks at ambassador han and lisas father while anxiously clutching her two way radio
into radio what happened
thru radio were made
gotta grab him
beat into radio all right
carson follows javal onto the freeway
colonel lee grabs his amd machine gun
we need him alive
colonel lee leans out and shoots javals rear tires out
the van drives erratically held in its lane by bumping against the cars around it
carson pulls up closer
suddenly the rear doors of the van burst open
and javal flies out riding a motorcycle
hes got the money stuffed into two big chaps sized saddlebags slung over the back of the machine
he straddles the lanes going against traffic riding like a maniac back the way he came
carson watches him in the rear view
and speeds up driving away from him
but carson hugs the shoulder moving through the heavy traffic until he spots what he was looking for the biker club riding in formation up ahead
carson cuts in front of them and slams on the brakes
he jumps out and grabs one of the bikers machines by the handlebars wrestling it to a stop
while pulling its burly owner off it fbi
call our office theyll take care of you
meanwhile the other bikers have come to help their friend
they pull guns knives chains
theyre stopped by sabatini who appears holding her mp machine pistol
the biker yells at carson as he drives way im a taxpayer
im a goddamn dentist
gets in the drivers seat of the mercedes and turns it around
continues down the freeway on his bike straddling lanes driving the wrong way retracing his route back to highland leaving car horns cursing and collisions in his wake
when everyone thinks theyve seen it all here comes another mad biker carson riding against traffic in pursuit
javal rides against traffic down the cahuenga on ramp then jumps the divider runs the light crossing highland and gets into the southbound lanes
he just misses a bus nearly wiping out
just dont kill yourself you piece of shit
carson fishes out his two way
continuing into radio helicopter or two would be nice
listening to the two way miranda tries to follow the action
into radio love to be in the loop on this
speeding up carson precariously cuts in between traffic
to himself not just now dear
seeing carson approaching on his right javal pulls his benelli shotgun from one of the saddlebags
he rests the barrel on his arm and fires a blinding white load of magnesium at carson
carson grabs the brake handles to slow down and the blast crosses just in front of him
a few burning pieces pepper the front fender of the bike but the bulk hits the concrete art deco statue in the entrance to the hollywood bowl
the statue shatters into a million flaming fragments
continuing grumbling i coulda had a ranch
maybe some horses
but no we moved to l
a car passing on the right bumps him
javal grabs for the handlebar to stabilize himself dropping the shotgun
a helicopter appears and flies just above him
then spotting some police cars ahead he quickly hangs a right ducking onto alta loma terrace
carson stops at the entrance to the winding hillside neighborhood accessible only by footpaths
the area is covered by thick foliage hiding javal from the helicopter
carson revs down so he can listen for javals machine
he hears it up above and takes off up a steep flight of stairs
javal has reached the summit only to find hes boxed in
he can either turn around or take the neighborhoods unique outdoor elevator housed in a free standing three story concrete tower
he jumps off his bike
carrying the saddlebags he runs into the elevator but it needs a key to operate
javal comes back out panicking
he hears carson coming up the hill
he spots a gardener watering nearby with a hose
as he reaches the summit
he sees javals motorcycle abandoned lying on its side
and then he sees the gardener sprawled on the ground a bullet hole in the center of his forehead
carson turns off his motorcycle and pulls out his sig mm
he moves slowly toward the elevator tower and looks inside
the casement window in the back of the tower is broken
one end of the gardeners hose is tied to a grate and the hose is hanging through the broken window
carson looks out the window as javal climbs down the outside of the tower on the hose to high tower drive the street below
into radio hes on foot at the base of the elevator tower
but just as carson is about to climb down the hose
javal spots a college girl backing a tiny geo out of her garage
he rips her out of the car jumps in and tears away
carson jumps back on his motorcycle and starts it up
into radio goddammit
hes in a blue geo
in the geo javal drives out onto highland
he muscles his way through traffic then cuts across to franklin
behind him robbins and walther drive along the divider lane
on the bike carson emerges from alta loma joining sabatini and dave in daves dodge and colonel lee in the mercedes as they all try to catch up to javal
the helicopter flies ahead then disappears past the hill below franklin
javal hangs a hard right off of franklin onto vine putting him on top of a hill that drops down to sunset
carson and colonel lee close in on the geo
suddenly the helicopter rises up from the bottom of the hill
its less than fifty feet in front of javal at eye level
javal fires at the copter with his beretta
colonel lee indiscriminately fires his machine gun at the geo
carson shouts at colonel lee furious at his carelessness
colonel lees bullets trace across the cockpit of the helicopter one hits the pilot in the neck
clutching it with one hand the pilot loses control of the copter
everyone on the road scatters to get out of the copters way
it appears as though its going to crash onto the street then it gains altitude gyrating wildly just above the geo
javal tries to move away but one of its landing runners smashes through the top of the windshield wedging itself against the inside of the geos roof
snared the little geo is lifted off the ground instantly too high for a terrified javal to escape from it
the wounded pilot barely conscious searches for safe area to set down but there are cars and people everywhere
the pilot wrestles his stick his copter is almost impossible to control with the car hanging from it
the copter and geo lurch over and past the round capitol records building knocking the spindle off the top of it
the impact further destabilizes the copters flight
its heading right toward the story sunset vine tower at the bottom of the hill
javal trapped inside looks through the windshield as the glass and steel side of the tower looms closer
the copter and the geo crash into the side of the tower floors up
glass blows out in all directions the rotor shatters office furnishings are blown through the hole like backwash
the geo hangs passengers side down from the runner
from the series of jerking slipping movements it is clear the copter is not going to stay where it is for long
the geos passenger side door pops open
javal panting with fear jimmies his foot against the dashboard and holds the steering wheel to keep from falling out
in the clog of traffic cars swerve away rapidly reverse
anything to get away from the area below the impact
reacts to another slip
the big saddlebags of money on the seat start to slide toward the open door
he gingerly reaches over to grab them
the copter shifts again
he loses his grip
and clutching the saddlebags he topples out of the car
we stay with him as he falls stories screaming
then landing on top of a parking meter
it rips though his chest and he hits the sidewalk with a wet thud
carson rushes across the street to javals body
the teetering copter and geo are right above it
grimacing carson tries to lift javals body up off the parking meter but its messy slippery work
unable to move the body carson quickly searches its pockets
all he finds is the now empty prescription bottle
above the copter groans
its about to come loose
carson pulls out his sig mm and fires several times at javals right wrist then tears the hand off the body
with a loud wrenching of metal the copter and geo break away from the building
carson grabs the saddlebags and runs like hell across the street diving for cover behind a car
the copter and geo crash to the sidewalk and explode
sooty covered in javals blood carson crosses to the others
he throws walther the saddlebags and sabatini the severed hand
to walther hes not gonna tell us where to find the hostages
more carson contd looks at watch meaning we got exactly minutes to figure it out for ourselves
figure it out
ignores him into radio miranda
we need a copter pronto
to robbins get back to his van
there were no plates but check the vin look it over then meet us at the consulate
robbins is still trying to process what just happened
the clock reads pm
carson miranda robbins sabatini ambassador han and colonel lee are all talking at once
to walther scrounge us some bodies national guard state troopers chps local pds meter maids theyre gonna search the whole city in a goddamn hour
look i dont need you to tell me how fucked we are
every time youre on a case something explodes
carson looks like hes going to explode
before he can reply stop
the clocks running
arguing is a luxury we cant afford
more miranda contd looks at carson whats done is done
therell be plenty of time to point fingers later
carson would love to get into it but he lets it slide
he looks sabatini wandering aimlessly with javals severed hand
i need some fuckin ink
carson grabs one of the expensive pens from ambassador hans desk snaps it in half and hands it to her
in the b
she stands at the credenza inks the hands fingers and thumb and rolls them onto a piece of letterhead paper
this is impossible
how can you even begin to find them
all eyes go to miranda
well the normal procedure is to negotiate with the perpetrator
her head is spinning
she looks at carson
lets take stock
weve got a picture of where he hid the family and recordings of his calls thats right
we can send them to our experts for analysis
to ambassador han same with his fingerprints
but that means we need high quality image and data transmission
we can piss away ten minutes coptering this shit to our offices in westwood or we can use your surveillance equipment
there is no surveillance equipment
this is a diplomatic facility you want to play games fine
he turns to go
ambassador han turns to colonel lee
take them upstairs
in the converted attic several north korean espionage agents monitor military and police frequencies downlinks from remote wiretaps and surveillance units short wave cellular etc
their equipment being of chinese and iranian manufacture is hardly cutting edge technology
colonel lee and ambassador han enter
the espionage agents are surprised when carson miranda walther and sabatini follow
walther looks around amazed
carson grabs a pair of headphones
south korean consulates just down the street want to take a listen
colonel lee pulls the phones away from him
carson takes the page with the fingerprints from sabatini
the espionage agents back away from her and javals hand
continuing re hand shitcan that thing will you
she looks around
then shrugging she tosses it into a wastepaper basket
continuing to colonel lee got a digital scanner
looks equipment over you might want to drop a few bucks at radio shack and get with the decade
into radio dave get in here
bring your computer a city map and the tapes of the ransom calls
thru radio on my way
hes also heard faintly through the laser eavesdropping unit by the window
carson notices but doesnt comment
to colonel lee colonel you saw the perp
describe him to the ambassador see if its anyone he knows
colonel lee begrudgingly obliges
carson dials a phone
into phone this is carson in l
theres a set of prints coming over
narrow the search criteria male thirties caucasian
french belgian swiss maybe canadian
try kidnappers and bombers first
we need an answer in fifteen minutes
fbi headquarters with the washington monument in the b
a technician wearing thick glasses sits in front of a high resolution computer monitor
into phone that yellow air out there finally rot your brain
thru phone dazzle me
carson clicks off the phone then as he dials another number to walther we got one of the best sound guys right here in town
into phone newman in audio analysis
dave comes into the room
he quit couple weeks ago
opened a bed and breakfast in wyoming
carson looks at miranda and hangs up the phone
continuing looks around damn
they get hbo
id sure like to see the fight tonight
get those tapes transferred to a sound guy
we need ambient and background analysis the whole enchilada
enchilada you saying that because im mexican
cause youre fat
picks up javals fax photo enhancement
isnt there some amazing tech with the lapd bronsky
transferred to seattle pd a month ago
id send it to langley
let the cia earn their keep
carson tosses javals bloody unlabeled prescription bottle to miranda
she looks it over runs her finger inside tastes the dust on her fingertip
given his behavior this orange residue
id say desoxyn mg
its consistent with the lone wolf scenario a handful of these is pure bravery in a bottle til the psychosis and paranoia kick in
beat we could check pharmacy records on the remote chance he got them legally
if we had a couple of weeks that is
to sabatini get the bureau on it
its a waste of manpower
look goddammit you start skipping no chance in hell leads we can all quit and go to the beach right now
sabatini looks at them which will it be
miranda frowns and nods her okay then spreads the l
map out on the table
continuing he grabbed the family at
the last certain visual we had was just before his van went into the alley on la cienega at
he called the consulate at
that gives him about fifty minutes to get to his location move and secure the hostages and activate his time bomb
he probably waited a while to pad the time he wanted us know the family was still alive
sotto re koreans so these crazy bastards wouldnt throw a premature shit hemorrhage but he didnt want to call too soon either
i say theyre within to minutes via surface streets of where we last saw them
he draws a circle on the city map beverly hills to downtown hollywood to inglewood
the most densely populated part of the l
this narrows it down to about dwellings
a beat while this sinks in
continuing he was traveling west bet he doubled back
cmon thats total conjecture re carson id trust his instincts when dealing with maniacs
he is deeply disturbed
youre telling me
everyone is smoking
their tension has increased tenfold since we last saw them
the president seen through the video setup is pacing on air force one
north koreans have gone ballistic accusing us of botching the ransom drop on purpose
theyre still harping on that american plot nonsense
thru video link meaning
they say the death of the premiers niece and her family would justify immediate retaliation
thru video link are they out of their fuckin minds
what kind of retaliation
everyone in the room looks at one another
theyre threatening to pull a saddam hussein remember the scuds he lobbed at jerusalem during desert storm
beat theyre talking about firing a missile into los angeles thru video link a goddamn what
best guess is an as medium range cruise their version of our tomahawk launched from offshore
the as is gyro guided
it will find the city but its not too accurate beyond that
still for their purposes its perfect hit somewhere in l
take out a city block or two
to the eyes of the world its a measured response like what reagan did to qaddafi
but actually striking at an american city would be a huge psychological victory for them
thru video link i dont believe im hearing this
beat so if we know its coming we can knock it out of the fuckin sky
these weapons fly subsonically below radar
we dont have the defenses in place
if wed had the time to deploy a string of patriot anti missile batteries across the coast thru video link youre saying we got all this lousy hardware and cant
stop one goddamn missile
everyones silence answers his question
continuing thru video link i want an immediate search for all ships within range
we better inform the other leaders stall on the summit thru video link theres no reason to panic yet they cant launch until after the familys confirmed dead
afraid thats not the case
the intelligence officer illustrates his explanation with footage and diagrams on a nearby computer screen the north korean premier holds what we call a brinksman switch
hes able to destroy a missile in flight right up to the moment before it achieves its target
our op says theyve timed their retaliation to hit right after
and if the family turns up okay theyll just make it self destruct
thru video link shit
i really dont need this today
were forgetting one thing here the family
intelligence is sure the north will abort their attack if mrs
han and her kids are safely returned
their whole game depends on claiming a legitimate provocation
still we should let them know thered be a response
if it comes to it
thru video link id like to turn em into a radioactive parking lot
thats the problem we cant
were the last superpower
our hands are tied by politics alliances goddamn stacks of treaties
most we could do is give em a measured response back again or everyone starts crying that were the bullies
damn i miss the cold war
russians wouldnt have dreamt of pulling a stunt like this
thru video link believe me the north drops one in my fuckin city im dropping ten in theirs
get some bombers in the air
and dont tell me any more bad news
robbins stands by javals van on the shoulder of the freeway
into radio phone company decals a fake
dmv says the van was purchased a week ago from a private party in santa monica
i called em they said the guy paid cash and he fits our boys description
signed the name douglas mcarthur to the transfer of title
into radio cute
to miranda he signed the name of the allied commander during the korean war
maybe he was a political
the phony ice cream truck the booby trapped chairs
he couldve more miranda contd done it without half that stuff
but this was going to be the score of a lifetime
he was showing off
to dave whos got those kinds of skills electronics vehicle customizing computers explosives
shit your average high school student if theyre so inclined
my guess is our perp used off the shelf equipment for everything except the c and thats only slightly harder to get than crack or heroin if you know who
everyone who can be spared even moth eaten support personnel hustle through the maze of hallways and get into waiting cars
from up here it looks like the city is one big block party
accordingly traffic is heavy and unpleasant
i know were about to have quite a party out there but dont forget the golden rule on the roadways
news time is
bobbi looks into the tv camera dripping with sincerity
this is bobbi marchfelder your eye in the sky
back to you brent

piy ngyang north korea establishing day general kai stands in hushed conversation with the army major operative and another trusted aide
the phone buzzes the others leave the room before general kai picks it up
behind closed doors the operative listens to the phone call with an eavesdropping receiver
what he hears stuns him
the operative is in his hiding spot with his uplink device
urgently into device missile heading to l
has a kipchak warhead
repeat missile is kipchak equipped
it was switched by order of a gunshot rings out os and the operatives chest explodes in blood
he pitches forward
but presses the transmit button on the uplink device before dying
on screen it says uplinking
then another gunshot destroys it
angry general kai steps into frame and kicks the operative over with his foot
han and joy sit motionless
sam on the other hand is trying not to squirm
han looks at him angry
he asked you if you had to go
the family becomes aware of a shrill sound os distant at first but growing increasingly louder
the sound level meters all begin to creep upward
a team of gardeners has arrived on the property for their weekly mow blow and go
they have lawnmowers edgers blowers its as noisy as an aircraft carrier during takeoffs
the sound is getting louder and louder
oh my god
the meters are hovering just below the red
pivots his head and looks at the tiny microphone no bigger than a pencil eraser attached neatly to the headrest
he begins chewing his wad of gum
leans in toward the microphone his head obscuring what hes doing
he moves back and we see hes sealed the front of the mic with a small piece of the gum
and his meter drops to zero
sam tilts his head forward and bends his wrist upward so he can get the rest of the gum out of his mouth
then while keeping pressure on the armrest with his elbow he moves his hand over to mrs
they cant quite reach each other
he flicks the piece of gum and she catches it
meanwhile the noise increases
the two meters peak into the red
the yellow warning light begins to flash
han quickly puts the gum in her mouth bites it in half and cautiously passes the remainder over to joy
joy puts the gum in her mouth
she tries to push it over her mic but her hair is in the way
she shakes her head some hair strands remain but she covers the mic just as the gardeners noise reaches a crescendo
all three sound meters sit pinned to zero
the yellow light stops flashing
sam sweating looks at his mother and sister
and starts laughing
they join him a celebration for a small victory
the clock on the wall reads eastern time
the president still on air force one appears on the video link
cut the tension in the room with a knife
youd need a chainsaw
thru video link so what the hell does kipchak mean
uh its a code name
for weapons using the yersinia pestis bacillus
he really doesnt want to be the one telling the president about this
continuing kipchaks were asian nomads
in they attacked a genoese fort and catapulted infected corpses over the walls
the genoese who survived carried the disease back to europe
and it killed half the population
thru video link get to the goddamn point major
the intelligence officer looks at the cia chief
seems the missile is armed with a warhead carrying the pneumonic plague
the president goes nuts
thru video link the black plague
every time i talk to you fuckin guys it gets worse
what happened to this limited retaliation shit
the north koreans insist the missile carries a conventional payload
they say were trying to trick them into aborting the attack
especially since the uplink from our op in pyungyang was unencrypted
we think one of the hard liners switched the warhead without the premiers knowledge
but hes not about to take our word for it and hes too weak to risk the humiliation of backing down
incredulous thru video link they use a biological weapon on american soil they have to know well respond
maybe they dont think we got the guts
maybe they want a war cause they think they can whip us like what happened in nam
look who were dealing with a teetering outlaw regime and inside it some wild ass renegades working their screwy agenda
thru video link what the hell are we doing in l
weve deployed marines from pendleton and twenty nine palms army from ft
irwin put em in protective suits but its minutes before theyre on the ground
thru video link all right
assuming the worst
the intelligence officer demonstrates with another of his the warhead vents the plague bacteria above the target area infecting about people
first symptoms are vomiting lymph nodes become swollen temperature rises to
victims turn deep purple from lung hemorrhaging usually die the same day
beat there are treatments streptomycin and tetracyclines but wed be overwhelmed by the numbers and its extreme contagiousness
we could have infected in a week who knows how many after that
long beat as everyone tries to contemplate the unthinkable
thru video link im gonna toast those fuckers
have the summit leaders been warned
no ones landing in l
til we give the all clear
thru video link and youre sure its safe if we can get em to destroy the missile in flight
the bacteria cant survive the heat of an explosion
i suggest none of this go any further not even to the agents working to find the family
word leaks out to a city of million people theres rocket full of the plague coming at em youll create a panic of biblical proportions
everyone is painfully on edge
ambassador han paces
the fbi agents are on a phone or a radio working leads
colonel lee mutters something to ambassador han in korean
perhaps someone will decide it is foolish to incur the wrath of north korea
crosses to colonel lee yeah the u
is behind the whole thing
and were knocking our heads trying to find your people just for show
lets grab a few beers kick back til five oclock rolls by
then maybe we can have a war over it
i think thats a great idea seeing as how you fuckers have needed your clocks cleaned for fifty years now
gets up why wait until five
ambassador han and walther keep carson and colonel lee from going at each other
sotto christ youre self indulgent
theres nothing but anger and cynicism left inside you so theyre all you can express any more
no wonder everyone in the bureau thinks youre such a nutcase
hey im not the only one with a rep around the office
knoll it all

she walks away
carson immediately regrets saying it
to himself shit
lapd cruisers squeeze through the crowded streets fanning out through the various parties around town
cops walk through the crowds with copies of the picture javal faxed and photos of the han family and lisa
the red tipped cruise missile flying at mph feet above the water streaks toward its distant target
robbins is still working the phone

meanwhile we hear the high pitched whine as daves modem connects with another computer
daves fingers fly across the keyboard and in a moment a picture of javal appears hair longer bearded
but the eyes are unmistakable
continuing hes on our hit parade
interpol passed us his records when he entered the country

they turn noticing that ambassador han has overheard
ambassador quit apologizing for me

hes in a high rise
sabatini youre with us

in the tiny bedroom of a wheelchair bound japanese teenager computers and ham radio equipment are stacked everywhere
he turns on a tape recorder
we hear a faint crackling voice on recorder missile heading to l
has a kipchak warhead
repeat missile is kipchak equipped
the teenager rolls to a computer running compuserve
he clicks the chat icon types anyone up on their spy terminology
with the gardeners gone and their sound sensors disabled mrs
han joy and sam are shouting for help
they listen for a response it is completely quiet
just as the government helicopter lands bobbis news copter lands right next to it
bobbi intercepts carson sabatini miranda and colonel lee on the pad
her cameraman follows eng camera on his shoulder videotaping everything
oh great the media
realizing its the goddamn traffic girl

hey you expect to use my stations facilities and not even tell us carson grabs the eng camera pops the videotape out of it and crushes the tape
to bobbi sorry

miranda is utterly aghast
she reaches under carsons jacket and takes the handcuffs off his shoulder rig
she grabs bobbi by the arm and gets her in a half nelson

the station manager comes running out of the building
i promised wed respect their news blackout
to herself figures

bobbi wriggles out of mirandas grasp
carson looks at his wife whos still fuming and smiles to himself
the station manager hands carson the keys to his lexus
i get an exclusive later right
this works out ill play the fuckin banjo for you
the cruise missile makes a slight course adjustment
people begin to arrive at the events
boosters pass out food wine and beer
and crank up the beach boys tunes
meanwhile law enforcement cars move into the areas with high rises century city westwood downtown etc
a sign on the control tower reads u
air force okinawa
flight crews direct a squadron of planes out onto the flight line f fighter bombers along with f fighter escorts
they begin to take off
the lexus is stuck in a dense knot of traffic
carson gets out and walks across the hoods of the stopped vehicles around him to much complaining by their owners until he finds the reason for the jam up along
the shoulder of the road a long line of equipment trailers and motor homes cables lights rent a cops and gawkers
a movie shoot
he hurries back to the lexus
miranda rolls her window down
were hoofing it
miranda and colonel lee immediately get out of the car and run off leaving sabatini to contend with it
pissed shes got the field experience
to park the fuckin car
a boxy ten story complex built in the sixties
carson fbi jacket folded over his arm miranda and colonel lee rush into the lobby
carson is about to show the concierge behind the desk his i
d but the concierge is nervous and sweating
carson pulls out his sig mm approaches the door behind the desk which is ajar
he pushes it open
and finds himself staring at the muzzles of three m rifles
three swat team members are standing there in full body armor
pulls out his i
they lower their weapons
continuing how the hell you get here so fast
theyre shootin a cop movie down the street
were workin as extras
who else is here
three officers on the roof next building over and two in the tenth floor hallway
tell em to be cool
were going up
to concierge give me your master key
the swat team sharpshooters crouch on the roof
thru radio feds going up anglo male and female asian male
sabatini drives the lexus in and parks it in the fire lane
the fire door opens next to an elevator with the number on it and carson miranda and colonel lee come out
carson and miranda creep quietly along the hallway toward apartment
carson listens at the door hears nothing
he moves to the next door down apartment and quietly unlocks the door
the shades are drawn and the apartment is dark
as carson and miranda cut through the apartment they realize theres a woman lying in the bed
shes naked and shes not alone
someone is under the sheets
the first woman opens her eyes sees the intruders and grabs for a colt gold cup
auto in the dresser drawer
what the fuck
her friend sits up
miranda holds her finger to her lips and shows them her fbi shield
carson cranks open their window and steps out onto the foot wide ornamental balcony
to miranda wait here
she begins to protest
he shoots her a look that silences her
the swat sharpshooters watch from the next building over as carson ten floors up peers through the slit in between the curtains into the window of javals apartment
he swings his legs over onto javals ornamental balcony
the bolts holding the rail onto the wall are loose and rusty
the balcony slips a little
he leans on the crank operated window until it snaps open
carson steps inside
he looks around the bedroom its empty
no furnishings the closet shelves are bare even the pictures on the walls are gone leaving only their outline
carson cautiously goes into the living room its also empty
all that remains are a few cardboard boxes and three flower pots in macrame ceiling hangers by the living room window
some dead leaves lie on the floor beneath them
into radio im in
its empty but sit tight while i look around
carson cautiously approaches the cardboard boxes
the clock on the bedstand reads
miranda smiles uncomfortably at the two naked women together in bed
i like what youve done with the place
the elevator dings
sabatini comes out h k mp in hand
swat team standing on the far side of the hallway with colonel lee sees her machine pistol and takes aim
colonel lee walks over to sabatini
sabatini starts down the hall
colonel lee stays where he is
carson cautiously peers in the moving boxes
he crosses to the front door looks it over unlocks the deadbolt
he turns the knob the button pops open
he stops noticing a hairline seam in the doorjamb where a piece was cut then neatly replaced
then hes startled as he hears a strange mechanical whining noise coming from the kitchen
he goes to investigate its an almost dead avocado green refrigerator straining to start its compressor
he looks for booby traps opens it and looks inside
looking down he notices hes got a dead leaf stuck to the bottom of his shoe
glancing in the living room he sees the dead leaves on the floor below the three hanging plants
he looks at the plants two are dead
the one in the middle is not
we hear the jiggle of the front doorknob
the front door opens
carson crouches behind the big heavy refrigerator door
as the middle flower pot explodes
its a shrapnel bomb it spews thousands of tiny carpet tacks degrees around room
sabatini is hit full on she falls backwards into the hall
miranda and the women in the darkened bedroom scream as the tacks tear hundreds of holes through sections of the wall
tiny shafts of light appear in the wall except where it is covered by furniture keeping them from being shredded
swat team and colonel lee come running as does miranda
carson is kneeling next to sabatini
she looks up at him and tries to say something but a only long mournful final breath escapes her
agonized carson looks around
and sees colonel lee
he lunges for him
i said keep everyone back
he punches colonel lee in the jaw
colonel lee slams against the wall then comes back at carson hitting him in the throat
miranda and swat team pull them apart
to colonel lee get out of my sight
he kneels next to sabatini and closes her eyes
its in between reports
the cameraman listens to the grateful dead on a boom box
bobbi answers her ringing cell phone
into phone marchfelder
thru phone you dated the mayor right
sighs into phone you need a traffic ticket fixed
excited thru phone try to confirm something for us
theres an incredible buzz on the internet someone picked up a classified message on a u
we think its authentic
the streets of hollywood are even more congested than before as the festivities really start rockin
carson and miranda sit together in the back and colonel lee sits next to the pilot as they fly back to the consulate
miranda looks at carson whos trying real hard not to let sabatinis death slow him down
into radio whats the status
thru radio wilshire and west pd divisions had seven vehicles running with sirens at
theyre getting the routes from the officers now
into radio hurry it the hell up
he glances over at miranda
after a beat continuing i shouldve known shed come up
shit theres a familiar word
long beat that day
i was there soon enough
we shouldve rushed em before they could finish setting up
the bureau never wouldve let you
they want it by the book talk them out
carson looks out the window not hearing a word she says
carson is in the fbi command truck talking on the phone to a bank robber barricaded inside the bank
phone in hand he holds a shotgun on a dozen hostages bank employees and customers including a couple of young kids
one is holding a soccer sized rainbow colored rubber ball
the other bank robber wires up a series of explosive charges
both robbers rush inside the vault and pull the door closed to protect themselves
the front of the building where the hostages are explodes
carson runs to the bank
he spots the kids ball rolling in the street
he turns away horrified devastated
twelve bodies only the hostages
you were a greenhorn
it wasnt your decision
you cant keep living as such a raw nerve never sleeping those kids were ten years old
sotto same age as the han boy
he turns away
she takes his hand
the family continues to call for help
as they do we their cries echo faintly through a deserted tangle of ladders construction equipment sheets of drywall etc
a warning sign taped to the wall near the elevator reads this floor has been temporarily vacated for minor earthquake retrofitting
the mood is glum
carson looks at robbins dave and walther then at the empty chair where sabatini had been sitting
whos pulling javals bank records
what about cross referencing possible aliases
we got minutes
hearing beach boys music on the tvs and radios on the surveillance console carson angrily punches them all off
suddenly miranda looks at him camry
reaches for phone where are the numbers for the outdoor ad companies
parker centers making those calls
bobbi and the news cameraman are arguing bitterly turn the fuckin camera on
maybe its true
probably is true
thats why they got a news blackout
ill rip your miserable eyeballs out
news is our fuckin job
he sighs and turns the camera on
the han family listens to bobbi amazed horrified
on tv a warning was radioed to u
intelligence that a biological weapon allegedly containing the deadly pneumonic plague is approaching los angeles
while unconfirmed the president and other leaders are all late in arriving
the tvs are off so they see none of bobbis report
carson crosses to dave
hes at his computer looking at a long column of telephone numbers
finally got the call list from javals phone
most arent his theyre from the legit user who didnt know his number was cloned
go to the bottom of the list work back through the last hours
dave jumps to the bottom points at a number
heres the call to the consulate
while scrolling the rest are dupes
all from the other guy
the one at seven this morning
dave highlights a number
carson glances over at the telephone on colonel lees desk
from when carson took a call there pushing the mute button
on the label showing the phones extension number x
across the room colonel lee is watching carson intently
carson turns to look at him
they make eye contact
time stands still
feeling like hes moving in slow motion carson reaches for the sig mm in his shoulder holster
colonel lee grabs the amd machine gun on the desk
colonel lee strafes the room and backs toward the door
the bullets trace a line across the room
one of the north korean espionage agents is hit
he slams against the console
carson tackles ambassador han and shoves him onto the floor while popping off several rounds in colonel lees direction
robbins also dives for cover pushing walther down first
robbins takes a bullet in the shoulder
miranda is hit
the impact tumbles her over the desk
continuing colonel lee still firing slips out the door
gunsmoke hangs in the air as carson scrambles to miranda
several phones have begun ringing
no one notices them
dave never moved he sits hunched over clutching his notebook computer muttering the hail mary
carson rolls miranda over
shes got a large scorched bullet hole in the front of her blouse
carson tears her blouse open
shes wearing a kelvar vest under it and the slug is mushroomed against the vest
she awakens gasps and starts swinging her fists at him
carson is overwhelmed with relief
then he notices robbins bleeding profusely propped against the wall next to walther
walther is dead shot in the head
os we hear several spurts of machine gun fire and a car engine roaring to life
miranda looks at carson
the citys reaction to bobbis announcement is immediate and severe
it makes the panic during the riots look like a drive in the country
carson bursts through the door just as the second armored mercedes crashes through the wrought iron entry gates
carson fires several shots which ping harmlessly off the mercedes
carson sprints for a car
mirandas volvo is the closest one
as carson is starting it the passenger door opens and ambassador han gets in
get the fuck out of here
ambassador han responds by putting on his seat belt
carson sighs and tears out of the driveway
colonel lee crashes through the fremont place guard gate then hangs a right on wilshire
he drives the center turn lane zooming past the snarl of cars
in the back of the consulate miranda sore as hell climbs into the government copter
it whines to life and takes off
carson looks around at the chaos around them
shit its like a godzilla movie out here
then he hears on a nearby cars fm radio thru car radio these words which have terrified the city thru car radio a biological weapon allegedly containing the deadly pneumonic
plague is approaching los angeles
stunned carson looks over at ambassador han who buries his face in his hands
into radio miranda
thru radio i heard
im in the copter
into radio i want you to get out of here
miranda is flying just behind carsons volvo
the traffic is beyond nightmarish
she smiles at his concern for her
into radio shut up and keep your eyes on the road
thats my goddamn car
beat into radio dave
you staying on top of the research
sweating dave is watching the action outside on a tv while hurriedly bandaging robbins shoulder with some torn cloth
he grabs for the two way and we realize hes panicking
into radio i cant
thru radio calmly listen the best way to help them is to stay at your computer
if any information comes in holler
he squeezes his eyes shut
after a long beat into radio okay
several large military helicopters approach troop contingents from pendleton and ft
the big ch dual rotor copters set down and offload marines and army infantry
others like apache gunship combat copters and hueys begin to follow the pursuit
they join the police and tv copters and it looks like the ride of the valkyries
people flee from the festivities in droves
seeing the helicopters and troops in bio suits only fuels the hysteria
we hear news reports coming from car radios boom boxes tvs
reporters chatter urgently in english spanish japanese korean farsi their voices mixing with the shouts of pedestrians the rumbling and horn blowing of the traffic
everyone everywhere is getting into their cars in a mad dash to get out of town or rendezvous with loved ones
this is the mother of all rush hours
colonel lees car turns right onto western avenue
hes in the heart of koreatown hardly any of the signs are in english
he swerves through the panicked drivers jamming the roads in the center lane or into the oncoming traffic
the cars he hits crumple against the mercedes without slowing it down
carsons volvo follows squeezing through traffic in its wake
bobbi is salivating with excitement and antacid
she snaps off her mic and yells at her cameraman dont lose the benz moron
show the other copters around us
this is fuckin great
ambassador han looks glumly at the chaos in the streets
the colonel hired javal made it look like he was working alone
then he made sure javal got killed so wed never find your family and theyd have an excuse to drop their bomb
but whats in it for em
there are men in my government whose power depends on north korea staying as it is socialist repressive isolated from the world
theyll resort to anything even war to keep it that way
they have the hitler syndrome if their country cannot exist the way they want it they would rather see it destroyed
colonel lee gets stuck in a line of cars trying to get onto the east
above a swarm of helicopters circle him
marine major vreeland and his pilot sit in the lead helicopter an apache gunship
carson leans on the horn and tries to push through traffic
thru radio fbi this is major vreeland
discontinue your pursuit were gonna box his ears from up here
into radio negative his cars armored
and we need the bastard alive
thru radio weve got the situation in hand
colonel lee sees the apache helicopter approach
he leans into the back seat knocking the top off a long plastic crate
the sunroof on the mercedes slides open
colonel lees upper body pokes through the sunroof
hes holding a manportable s
a foot long fiberglass rocket launcher
vreeland tries to bring his machine guns to bear on colonel lee but theres no time
to pilot shit
colonel lee depresses the trigger on the launcher and a rolling pin sized rocket is expelled
the rocket slams into a police helicopter just in front of the apache creating a huge fireball turning the copter into two tons of red hot shrapnel
carson and ambassador han watch with horror
a hundred yards away theyre buffeted by the explosion
to tv camera jesus fuckin god
beat smiles uh i think were gonna set down now
back to you brent
the burning hull of the police copter crashes into a mini mall causing a fire and explosion
hot metal and debris pings and pops as it rains over the neighborhood sending cars and pedestrians rushing for cover
vreelands apache and the remaining helicopters scramble away
into radio out of the air or retreat meters from target vehicle
the copters set down in parking lots rooftops wherever
armed troops climb out to keep panicked mobs from swarming them in an attempt to leave the city
the han family watches the tv amazed as colonel lee ducks back down into the mercedes and closes the sunroof
i always hated that guy
other drivers not knowing whether colonel lees rocket is the biological missile scatter away from him
colonel lee squeezes onto the freeway on ramp
pieces of burning debris are still landing nearby
carson looks at ambassador han one of yours
han nods what the hell do you need heat seeking rockets for in l
there could be another riot

miranda has hitched a ride in a black and white
into radio stay back
lapds putting up a roadblock
several police cars clear a path for two huge yellow dwp bulldozers borrowed from a construction cite
they rumble up onto the eastbound freeway turn and then stop side by side facing oncoming traffic
they lower their huge front shovels to create a roadblock
bobbi sits impatiently microphone in hand
the copter has landed behind an am pm minimart gas station
bobbi her pilot and her cameraman turn when they hear a knocking on the windshield of their copter
oblivious to the panic on the streets a raggedy homeless guy stands with a spray bottle wanting to wash the windows on the copter
bobbi gulps some mylanta and waves him away save it for someone who gives a shit
all of the celebration locales are trampled abandoned messes
so much for fun fun fun and l
putting on its best
mobs make panicked runs on the stock in grocery drug and hardware stores
violence breaks out in the aisles and parking lots
people in their homes work feverishly to seal their doors and windows against the plague with tape towels plastic
colonel lee screeches to a stop feet from the bulldozers angling the mercedes so the drivers door is facing them
the windows on the mercedes glide open
carson hurries to catch up to it
colonel lee fires a rocket at the bulldozers through the drivers side window
the backblast from the launcher vents through the passengers side
the rocket impacts the bulldozer on the left the explosion actually flips the huge machine head over tail into the air
the bulldozer lands upside down on the lane divider crushing a portion of it
colonel lee rolls up his windows and drives around the burning wreckage
the other drivers really give him wide berth now
approaching downtown colonel lee turns onto the north
traffic moves aside for colonel lees notorious mercedes
carson catches up to it
thru radio the strela needs meters to arm so stay tight on his ass
carson slams his volvo into the mercedes
ambassador han braces himself on the dashboard
carson looks over at him
that kraut mobile have any weaknesses youd like to tell me about
i dont think so they said it was solid as a rock

as carson moves forward colonel lees window opens enough to allow the barrel of his amd machine gun to poke through
carson shoves ambassador hans head down and ducks
colonel lee strafes the volvo
carson looks up just in time to see
a pickup truck ahead stalled on the shoulder
carson slams on the brakes but its too late
the volvo crashes headfirst into the back of the truck
the volvos airbags deploy stopping carson and ambassador han from plowing into the dashboard
after a beat dazed i cant believe im still alive
this were a hyundai you wouldnt be
ambassador han looks at carson wondering if hes putting him on
the car is a twisted mess
carson cant get the door open
a red and white lafd paramedics ambulance puts on its siren and hurries to the volvo
two paramedics jump out

they pry his door open with a crowbar
carson climbs onto the roof of his car
grimacing from pain he looks around
continuing into radio anybody see him

the paramedics pry the passenger door open and help ambassador han out
carson looks at the ambulance

bobbi is standing next to her copter in the back of the minimart listening to this exchange on a police scanner
her cameraman is eating a microwave burrito
bobbi jumps in grabs the eng camera and yells at her pilot get this fuckin thing in the air
to cameraman out

as they take off what am i supposed to do when the plague comes hold my breath
they rapidly cut through the traffic

someone can shoot tear gas or a percussion grenade inside
into radio pete you havent gone

i couldnt stand making so many people happy
carson waves his arms as he sees a helicopter approaching
the glare from the sun masks the copters markings
it hovers above him
with the canvas bag slung over his shoulder carson jumps up onto the runner then climbs up inside the cockpit
carson closes the door then sees bobbi
i wanted a police copter
just tell me what to do
i flew two tours in nam
and he doesnt go unless i go
the door opens and bobbi comes tumbling out of it
theyre hovering above the roof of a high rise hotel downtown
bobbi lands with a huge splash in the rooftop swimming pool
surfaces sputtering and screaming im a respected electronic journalist you fuckin prick
carson replies by tossing her industrial sized bottle of mylanta out after her
in the distance there is smog on the horizon
they follow the north
ahead carson sees the mercedes cutting across lanes
into radio got im looks like hes headed for the
carson has the pilot hover just above and behind the mercedes
it comes to a stop and the sunroof opens up
carson lashes himself to the copters center post with a piece of the seat harness then slides the door open
he reaches into the canvas bag and takes out a road flare
he breaks the flare open igniting it
to pilot pull hard to the left on my signal
he braces himself on door jamb
below colonel lees head pokes up from the sunroof
colonel lee calmly aims the rocket launcher and fires
carson tosses the lit flare hard away from the helicopter
the pilot swings the helicopter in the other direction and the rocket follows the flare streaking past the helicopter
a few seconds later the rocket explodes in midair behind them
miranda sees what carson is doing
you fucking lunatic
the news pilot looks over at carson
hope you got more flares than hes got rockets
miranda and the l
cop both holding small tear gas pistols split up
crouching behind the cars on the freeway they sneak up on the stopped mercedes
carson takes another flare out of the canvas bag
he breaks the top off
and it doesnt ignite
below colonel lee loads another rocket into the launcher
miranda is climbing the metal stairs leading to a graffiti covered freeway sign
carson fumbles to pull another flare out of the canvas bag
avoiding coils of razor sharp concertina wire around the sign miranda fires a tear gas canister at the mercedes sunroof
it misses bouncing off the windshield filling the area with white smoke
colonel lee keeps his eye on the copter
carson gets the new flare lit and throws it away from the copter just as colonel lee fires another rocket
the rocket explodes a few dozen yards away
shrapnel peppers the copter damaging the rear rotor
struggling to maintain control the pilot heads for the sixth street on ramp below the freeway out of the line of fire
colonel lee spots miranda up on the freeway sign loading another tear gas canister
he strafes the sign
she flattens the bullets tear through the sign above her
cop rushes the mercedes
colonel lee fires at him hitting him across the legs
colonel lee ducks back into the mercedes and drives away
as miranda comes down from the sign
carson climbs up the embankment from sixth street to the
the downed l
cop waves as a pair of ambulances drive up lights flashing and sirens wailing
carson runs alongside one of the ambulances pulling the drivers door open before its stopped
the paramedic is the one who helped him and ambassador han out of the volvo
carson yanks him out of his ambulance
carson jumps in
miranda climbs in the passengers side
as he peels away miranda smacks carson on the head
youre completely deranged
playing chicken with rockets
well what the hell were you doing out there
what are both of you doing
carson turns surprised and annoyed to see ambassador han his arm bandaged lying in the cot in the back
oh for christs sake
lights and sirens going they rush into the interchange
ahead colonel lees mercedes is driving through the cars that are parting like the red sea for him
even if we can pry him out with
looks at her watch twelve minutes to go i doubt hell be very cooperative
ill just use my outstanding people skills
carson glances up at the sign showing the upcoming exit glendale blvd echo park
a thought is forming
continuing to ambassador han that cars like a rock right
carson suddenly cuts to the left
when they reach the glendale blvd exit he slams the ambulance into the side of the mercedes forcing it onto the freeway off ramp
carson pushes the mercedes across bellevue avenue toward the park surrounding echo lake
colonel lee strafes the ambulance
carson keeps bumping the mercedes as they reach glendale blvd running right alongside the lake
with a hard shove carson sends the mercedes skidding off the road through the small guardrail and into the lake
carson slams on the brakes fishtailing the ambulance into the grass surrounding the lake
sig mm in hand he hops out
the mercedes is so heavy that its already half submerged
water pours in from the floorboards the air vents
colonel lee climbs out through the sunroof and fires at carson with his amd
carson ducks behind the ambulance takes careful aim
and shoots colonel lee winging him in the shoulder
colonel lees machine gun goes flying and he tumbles into the water
meanwhile cops army marines etc
arrive via helicopter and car
major vreeland is among them
the news media eng cameras bouncing on their shoulders run alongside them
carson races over to grab colonel lee who is slogging out of the lake
there is a glint of bright steel
and colonel lee slashes at carson with a knife
carson moves aside
but the knife slices across his upper arm
carson falls backwards
colonel lee on hands and knees tries to crawl away
suddenly someone kicks him in face flipping him over
colonel lees knife goes flying
carson bleeding piles onto colonel lee
colonel lee fights like mad to break free
until miranda jams her heel into his groin
he cries out

well these are fuck you pumps
pushes harder wheres the family
surprised at his wifes new negotiating technique carson shoots a look at vreeland
dave sits in front of his computer phone receiver resting on his shoulder riveted by the action on the tv
holy shit knoll it alls turned into dirty harriet
he turns as his modem squawks and another download comes in
continuing into phone youre sure there were no accounts in the other names i gave you
while miranda continues to apply encouragement to colonel lees gonads ambassador han limps over
he yells some orders at colonel lee
after a moment colonel lee sags
let him up
carsons not so sure but theyre completely surrounded by military and law enforcement personnel
he releases his grasp
miranda removes her heel
then with lightning reflexes colonel lee grabs vreelands rock island arsenal colt
auto from its snap holster
carson dives back onto him
but he twists his arm around and pulls the trigger with the muzzle underneath his own chin
carson miranda and ambassador han are sprayed with his blood
dumbfounded everybody looks at each other
carson dogged kneels next to colonel lees body and searches through his pockets looking for something anything
ahead in the distance the coastline comes into view
the family stares at the tv
han purses her lips
a tear rolls down her face
carson reaches for his two way radio
into radio dave
dave is looking at the tv paying no attention to his computer
as some bank records are being downloaded faxed images of processed checks scroll down the screen
thru radio anything else come through
numb into radio take a hint

shaking his head dave glances at his computer
just in time to glimpse the words first last deposit on one of the checks as it scrolls off the screen
fumbles to scroll back to the check
into radio wait
one of javals alias accounts check for an apartment rental
thru radio youre shittin
through the sheer curtains over the window we can see the han family sitting in their booby trapped chairs
park la brea
we pull back
theyre way up in a high rise building
the camera continues to pull back farther and farther
revealing apartment units on acres
the building in which the apartment is located is one of identical story towers standing side by side in a series of hexagons
vreelands apache helicopter lifts off
miranda looks at carson then checks her watch
into radio have the manager evacuate the complex

dave re energized is juggling the phone and the radio
into radio private securitys going around with pas and they set off the fire alarm
into phone well try callin him again
into radio managers gone and the assistant cant find the key to get to the rental manifest
into phone then kick the fuckin door down
the dense assistant manager milton stands in the outer office staring at the inner offices closed door
into phone ill try him in his car again
during this outside thru car mounted pa tenants leave your apartments at once
take the stairs
carson sticks the radio in his pocket and looks at miranda
fuck you pumps
the hostages can hear the whooping fire alarms and the os announcement
joy looks at mrs
they must know were here
police cars military vehicles fire trucks etc
converge on the complex from all directions
several helicopters circle the complex
one has a pa in it han family
show us your location
the family listens frustrated as the helicopters circle os
joy carefully slides her arm along the arm rest then tries to coax something out of her pocket her zippo lighter
they look over at her as she lights it
after a beat mrs
she hesitates then do it
joy drops the lighter to the floor then swats it with her foot to mrs
she does the same passing it to sam whos sitting closest to the window
with one eye on the vu movement meter sam kicks the lighter sliding it across the carpet toward the curtains
several cops and marines burst into the office
milton the assistant manager cowers as they shoot the lock off the door to the inner office and rush in
its a brown binder
says rental manifest
you cant miss it
they literally tear the office apart
the fire is consuming the curtains
thick toxic smoke begins to fill the tiny apartment and everyone starts coughing
they circle overwhelmed by the sheer number of apartments
into radio apartment number would be real helpful gang
miranda points to a wisp of smoke above one of the towers
they come around and spot the fire in the apartments window
it is nine stories up four stories below the top floor
the coast looms closer
the apache hovers parallel to the apartment feet away
carson feeds out a steel cable from a winch
then throws a spring loaded grappling hook onto the thick iron balcony railing
hanging onto a webbed rescue harness carson slides quickly across the line onto the balcony
using the butt of his sig mm he breaks a hole in the glass on the locked sliding glass door
he reaches through and unlatches it
the flames have engulfed both sets of curtains and have begun to creep across the floor and the ceiling
carson glances over at the electronics on the tv pm
the family is coughing from the smoke trying not to panic
in the kitchen lisa cant cough through the tape on her mouth
shes freaking out
seeing this carson runs over to her and pulls the tape off
she starts screaming so he grabs her face
work with me here
he grabs one of the refrigerator handles and pulls but it wont come loose
lisa cries out in frustration
hurry please hurry
carson spots javals toolbox
in it he finds a socket set handle which he levers in between the refrigerator handle and the door
he rips one handle loose then the other
carson turns his attention to the booby trapped chairs
lisa sits on the floor frantically pulling her handcuffed hands around her feet so theyre in front of her then runs for the front door
just as she reaches it he grabs her before she opens the door
theres a small magnetic sensor at the top of the door jamb
continuing we have to go out the window
cant you disarm the bomb
lets concentrate on getting you out of here
he looks at the meters on the electronic units
continuing sound detectors
sam covered them with chewing gum
high tech problem low tech solution
carson looks at sam impressed then peers under the chairs
use em in convertibles bad guy sits on your seat he sets the alarm off
these are rigged backwards get up you set em off
you a bomb expert
but ive had some car alarms in my day
to himself for all the goddamn good they do
carson looks around thinking
he spots the roll of duct tape on the table grabs it and unrolls a long piece
continuing to mrs
han slide your arm forward
watch the meter
keep the pressure on the armrest with your elbow
he wraps the armrest with tape cinching it tight
continuing itll squeeze the sensor duplicate the weight of your arm
pick it up
they look at each other scared
after a beat she does
the meter jiggles
but stays in the black
everyone sighs with relief
carson repeats the process on her other armrest
continuing to sam low tech solution
han lean back
carson feels for the sensor in the seat finding it buried under mrs
he runs a long piece of tape around the seat and wraps it tightly
he tries to lift mrs
han but the meter moves to the red
thru radio in his pocket hows it going in there
to himself nag nag nag
he wraps another piece of tape around the seat and tries again to lift her
this time it works
the missile has almost reached land
traveling toward the korean dmz
the apache helicopter hovering outside is making an incredible racket
carson is helping joy get free of her chair
as she stands the pieces of her hair stuck to the gum over the microphone head begin to pull the gum away
han sees the meter heading for the red and the yellow warning light flashing
she grabs carsons arm
carson quickly covers the mic
the meter drops to zero
the fire is spreading across the carpet and walls
carson is hurrying everyone out onto the small balcony
he helps lisa into the rescue harness
youll be over in five seconds
miranda pulls her across the cable and send the harness back
carson turns next to sam but he stands back so his sister can go
fifty nine seconds
sends sam across
the harness comes back
he straps mrs
han into it
tell em im gonna release the hook and ride down on the line
he pushes her across
as soon as shes there he gestures to the apache pilot to move closer so he can release the hook
slides back across to him carson grabs it with one hand and tries to undo the hook buckle with the other
but the cable is crooked and the buckle is jammed if he cant release it hes stuck there
carson tries to free the hook but its dug in between the concrete and the railing
fifteen seconds to go
carson looks over at the helicopter and waves them away
shouts release the cable from your side
get out of here
shouts back come over the railing
grab onto the harness
miranda turns to the pilot
tear the hook loose
itll pop the winch buckle
try it anyway
five seconds to go
the apache helicopter backs away from the high rise
the cable pulls taut
carson wraps the webbing of the harness around his wrist
the apache strains against the resistance of the cable
the entire railing around the balcony breaks away with carson hanging on the harness next to it
the helicopter turns and flies away
the bomb explodes blasting a huge hole in the tower
all the windows in the nearby towers and apartments implode
is engulfed in the fireball
we cant tell if hes alive
the force of the blast hits them like a tidal wave
the pilot fights to keep control while looking for a place to set down
huge chunks of debris glass furniture etc
carson and the section of railing underneath the helicopter swing like a pendulum from the force of the blast
groggy he loosens his grasp on the harness and jumps clear as the helicopter lands
miranda leaps out of the apache and runs to him
dust and debris from the explosion hang in the air helicopters crisscross the scene
everyone turns their eyes skyward looking for the missile
the premier and the high command are watching the action at park labrea on cnn live
as ambassador han embraces his family
furious general kai gets up and leaves the conference room
the others look at the premier
after a beat he crosses to a panel of electronics and slaps a large red button on it
the cruise missile explodes completely obliterating it
the lead jet cuts away turning around
the others follow
the han family crosses to carson blackened and bloody sitting on the curb next to miranda
ambassador han shakes his hand
han and miranda cry
joy and sam grin at him
after a beat carson gathers the kids up in his arms
it is a profound catharsis for him
general kai is getting into his car
he look up as an army officer approaches
and shoots him
the officer pushes his body into the passengers seat gets in and drives off
and the sound of running water
a beautiful ranch house and horse barn sitting on a meadow beside a brook overlooking an unspoiled pine forest
the pastoral scene is a commercial on the tv
carson wrapped in a towel holds the phone and paces
into phone ill call you next week
carson hangs up and clicks off the tv as he leaves the room
the sound of running water continues os
miranda wearing a bathrobe is watering her sickly roses
carson comes outside
who was that on the phone
beat they want me back on the hostage team
what did you say
told em id sleep on it
miranda smiles then looks at him surprised as he crouches down and helps her turn the soil around the rose bushes
they work in silence
then tentatively she leans over and kisses him
soon theyre in each others arms holding tight
still entwined carson and miranda stumble in
while kissing working with you today was certainly
its my outstanding people skills
he slips her out of her robe and they fall onto the bed
it is a tender romantic moment
until os a car alarm goes off
miranda bolts up
i hate this fucking town
carson ignores the alarm and mirandas comment
he pushes her back onto the bed and turns off the bedside lamp
all of the books and magazines about other places to live spill from his nightstand onto the floor
