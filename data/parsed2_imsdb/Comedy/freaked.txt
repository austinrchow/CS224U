written by tim burns tom stern alex winter january a horribly deformed figure hunchback misshapen head sits on a stool in complete silhouette
this is rick coogan
can you imagine it regis kathie lee
one day im a hot young movie star and the next day im a hideous mutant freak covered with festering lesions
oddly regis and kathie lee are also in complete silhouette
sounds like my wife when she misses a mudpack
the audience cracks up
kathie lee pooh poohs regis
to rick she turns ricky once you were the all american boy next door star of the beloved hey dude films
now the very mention of your name makes children scream in terror
weve all read about your disturbing story
but the people want to hear it from you ricky coogan
sfx children scream wont you tell us your story
well its kinda long but okay
it all started when i signed a deal to be spokesman for the e
logo a large metal shoe with a bar across it with the words everything except shoes beneath
widen to reveal richard hertz president of e
smiling rigidly to camera
rick coogan is next to him also holding a stiff movie star smile
they shake hands as the ees photographer takes publicity shots
off to one side behind hertz are several ees executives
behind rick is his entourage lawyer bodyguard trainer stylist and spirit
further off at the boardroom table four doddering old corporate farts on the brink of death look on with glazed expressions
through a clenched smile so what kind of crap do you scumbags want me to peddle
everything except shoes of course
he laughs pathetically
rick doesnt respond
hertz nods to a nearby executive who hands him some beef sticks
meaty twig beef sticks
rick takes them and holds them up to the camera
helmet head hair spray
he takes the hair spray and holds it up
the assistant carefully hands hertz a pulsating metal container with lots of warnings and danger symbols on it
hertz gives it to rick
noxon biogenetic neuro fertilizer
rick holds it up then pushes it away in disgust
ricky coogan does not do ads for hi tech cow shit
im a star got it hertz
to his aide rico give these misguided clowns tony danzas phone number and lets get the hell out of here
he gives the finger to the ees photographer who obligingly takes a picture
hertz waves at him to get lost and calls after rick whos headed to the door with his entourage
only you can stand up to the radicals trying to keep noxon from the struggling farmers whose very future depends on it
wasnt that just banned
only in the u
but i heard that shits lethal
hertz lets out a big laugh
he shakes his head at rick
rick rick rick
you want proof
just take a seat
rick nods to his entourage
they sit at the boardroom table across from the ees execs
an easel behind hertz shows a placard with a bar graph
hertz whispers something to an aide who scurries off
meet the head of our south american research facility juan valdez
the aide ushers in a handsome latin american executive in a natty three piece suit and a sombrero
my name is george ramirez
hes worked with noxon every day for five years and hes in fine shape
arent you juan
george glares at hertz bitterly
hertz stares him down
i am fine
me and my team in santa flan have santa flan
what kind of shitty name for a country is that
it is named for the patron saint of creamy desserts
as i was saying weve worked very closely with noxon
we cut back to george but he isnt george anymore
he has mutated into a similar looking actor in the same suit the same sombrero but shorter and swarthier
i personally supervised its development
rick furrows his brow
hes a little suspicious of georges transformation but just a little
now george is even shorter even swarthier
yet another actor
i performed rigorous scientific tests
no potential danger was left uninvestigated
ricks suspicion is increasing
he looks over to hertz who feigns total innocence
george is now even shorter
still another actor
his clothes are baggy and the sombrero is starting to slide down over his face
the environmentalists are crackpots all of them
rick looks at his entourage
their mouths hang open in astonishment
george has now shrunk to near midget proportions
the sombrero completely covers his head
when he takes it off we see hes now played by linda hunt
its ridiculous i tell you
rick is ready to ask questions but hertz cuts him off
thank you valdez
that will be all
george nods and heads back to his seat
as he passes behind hertz he cant resist sticking his thumbs in his ears and making a face
wait a second
ricky this is important
were talking about a major threat to the ees image
how does million dollars plus expenses sound
the aide reveals a new placard on the easel
it reads look it sounds great but i hear you
make it five million a new placard million that is if the board agrees
hertz reaches beside his chair and pulls a lever
the old geezers beside him raise their arms stiffly as if they were being pulled by strands of fishing line which they are
good its unanimous
well what do you say ricky
are you eess man in santa flan
rick looks at his advisors they look over at linda hunt then emphatically shake their heads no
rick looks at hertz who shows him five big fingers and grins
rick breaks into a big smile and gives hertz his trademark thumbs up sign
rick stands in line at the luggage x ray machine
he impatiently checks his watch as the x ray checker chats him up
a crazed anarchist holding a large bomb passes through the security check unquestioned
my kids just loved you in hey dude three the final countdown
we need more wholesome role models like you
where the fuck is ernie
we hear womens screams
they turn towards the noise and see a bunch of stewardesses scattering from a trendy young cad with a fake hand sticking out of his fly
this is ernie ricks buddy and resident court jester
all i wanted was a manicure
yah ha ha
he sees rick rick pumps ernies third hand
the miffed x ray checker points to ricks large carry on bag as it emerges from the x ray machine
mister coogan is this your bag
is this your kid
he indicates the x ray monitor where we see the skeleton outline of a bucktoothed bespectacled year old kid curled up in ricks bag
the kid waves
rick and ernie look at each other in horror
the bag bursts open and out pops stuey gluck an obsessive young autograph hound toting a stack of scrapbooks and memorabilia
i got a rare still from your high school production of the glass menagerie
could you sign it for me
lets get the hell out of here
ernie nods and yanks the bag away from under stuey
they run away down the corridor
stuey chases them holding up an by photo
rick and ernie run around a corner with stuey in pursuit
remember the speech you gave at the actors forum for social justice
he holds up a cassette player and hits play
its ricks old speech
if all the world is a stage then let us shine the spotlight on truth integrity and a deep compassion for all life
leave me alone troll
that was before i got an entertainment lawyer
quick down here
ernie leads rick down an adjacent hallway
its a dead end
rick and ernie are trapped
ernie gives rick a sheepish look
stuey stands at the entrance of the hallway
he holds up a time magazine
it says here noxons dangerous
why are you lending your name to it
whats happened to you rick
you used to be good
i just dont know
stuey starts to cry
rick looks guilty
dont cry stuey im still good
a passing electric baggage cart nails stuey at full speed and carries him off down the corridor screaming bloody murder
rick and ernie high five
a sexy stewardess pours champagne for rick and ernie
the anarchist sits nearby with the bomb on his lap
rick winks suggestively at the stewardess
she walks off obviously not interested
rick raises his glass to ernie oozing sleazy confidence
in the bag
the plane hits turbulence and ricks drink flies up out of his glass he catches it as it comes down
another stewardess helps the anarchist put his bomb in the overhead compartment
ernie ogles her
she sneers at him
we hear the captains voice on the loudspeaker
ladies and gentlemen this is your captain speaking
to the right of the aircraft you can see a great view of the grand canyon
all the passengers crane their necks to the right
and to the left you can see a panic stricken little troll
rick turns to his window and flings open the shade to reveal
on the wing pressing his face up against the glass
hes holding up a publicity shot of rick and screaming something we cant hear
stuey loses his grip and is whisked off the wing
rick watches him fall into oblivion
relieved he turns nonchalantly to ernie ignoring the other horrified passengers
you gonna eat your peanuts ernie
nah you can have em
a large haystack sits in the middle of a field
we hear stueys approaching scream
stuey misses the haystack by a few feet
he hops to his feet and dusts himself off
hey im okay
his scrapbook falls into frame and beans him
we see the airliner lowering its landing gear as it makes its final approach to the runway
here we are ernie santa spam
world famous for loud music and hot sex
give me a few hours
the plane explodes in a fireball
swish pan to reveal
standing just outside the airport
a porter follows with their bags
sure glad that wasnt our plane
theyre distracted by the sound of chanting
they squint into the distance where they see a group of chanting protesters young save the earth types latter day hippies kids seniors etc
ees mustnt stay
take your toxic crap away
ees mustnt stay
some of their signs read say no to noxon
coogan go home ees is killing our earth
ricky coogan sucks shit this one held by a nice little girl i like ike held by a confused old man shuffling around aimlessly drink pepsi and finally
free nelson mandela we widen to reveal the subheading inside specially marked boxes
we keep widening to reveal that this is not on a protest placard but a box of cereal some guy is eating as he watches the protest
we better find the limo before these whale kissers chop us up and sell us for parts
he spots the limo there it is
off to the side away from the protesters an unmarked limo with tinted windows and plates that say not ees awaits
kevin an ees exec leans out the window and waves discreetly at ricky
the stewardesses looking tipsy wave their bras out the back window invitingly
ernie tries to grab ricky by the arm but he resists
hes looking at the protesters
wait a second
standing in the center of the crowd of protesters holding a megaphone to her mouth and chanting
she puts down the megaphone to rest and we can see that shes powerfully beautiful in a no nonsense feminist kind of way
this is julie
rick is smitten
lets go rick
i got a better idea
if i can just find the right disguise
coog those hippiesll tear us apart
rick spots a heavily bandaged man limping out of the airport on crutches
rick approaches him waving a roll of bills
hey howd you like to make a quick hundred bucks
the man mutters something weakly
ernie puts his ear up close to hear him better
he says the pants dont usually come off for less than two fifty but since youre so cute hell make an exception
buried beneath rolls and rolls of bandages making his way through the protesters on crutches
ernie helps him along nervously
as rick spots julie from behind he hands the crutches over to ernie
ernie takes the crutches
rick waves his arms dramatically clutches his bandaged legs and winces in pain
give me back my crutches
oh the pain
he falls theatrically at julies feet
are you okay
let me help you
dont worry about me
whats one mans pain weighed against the global injustice of corporate tyrants like ees
the fight must continue
julies buying it big time
she gazes deep into ricks eyes
my names julie
ernie sticks a hand out grinning sarcastically
glad to meet you
julie turns on ernie viciously
she slaps him hard and grabs the crutches from him
give me those ape
help him up
rick rises to his feet painfully
hey josh a busload of us are headed over to maracas to protest noxon and pelt ricky coogan with cow shit
you could ride with us
youre with him
she looks at ernie who grins stupidly
oh hes okay
have you ever heard of an idiot savant
except for the savant part
ernie glares at rick
rick smiles at julie hopefully
julie looks at them both and cant help smiling herself
ernie drives the battered old convertible which bears the proud logo of santa flan rent a car
theres a pepsi billboard in the background
julie massages rick in the back seat
faking terrible pain ooooh my pelvis
is this better
rick moans and cracks a huge grin through his bandages
ernie tries to get in on the conversation
you know im kind of an idea man myself
like lets say theres a nuclear war and the only two people left are you and the pope
would you pork him
disgusted julie smacks ernie sharply and continues massaging rick
scowling with jealousy ernie tries a new approach
but one things for sure
that coogan guy sure is an asshole huh
what a total piece of shit
dont you think so josh
rick grits his teeth
well hes got a few problems
and what a lousy actor
i mean can you believe that hey dude crap
well with a script that bad coogan deserves an oscar for coming off as good as he did
i mean thats what i read
well hes no christian slater
i could act circles around that one note hack
he was shittin his diapers when i was the toast of broadway
i made grown men cry
i made crippled children laugh
now all i ever hear is slater
well enraged rick rips the bandages off his face
you think slater could improv like this
make you believe he was an invalid
julie stares at him in shock
rick catches his breath realizes what hes just done and smiles weakly
ernie tries to break the awkward silence
so do you like swedish films
julie gives him a murderous look
high wide shot the car is descending deeper into the wild jungle towards a huge eerie sunset
julies been lecturing rick for some time now
you dont even want to hear the truth about noxon do you coogan
i mean look im not saying this stuff is going to turn anyone into a
on the road behind julie he sees a crude carnival billboard featuring a painting of a huge worm with a mans head
it reads see the incredabel humin werm
only at elijah c
skuggs famus freek land
julie cant see it
a human worm
i mean thats just stupid
the point is rick sees another billboard for the freak show
this one features a half man half dog creature and says see the aztownding dawg boy
yeah or a dog boy
this one features the hidyous frawg man
hideous frog man
now youre just being silly
human sufferings just a big joke to you huh
you are sick coogan
she turns away from him in a huff and looks out her window
she sees a billboard that reads see the hole amazing famly of freekz at elijah c
skuggs famus freek land and mutent emporeum
a freak show
lets check it out
kind of like a family reunion for you huh
lighten up coog could be a goof
the car turns into a driveway near a crude hand painted sign that says freekztm thiss waey with a messy arrow
we zoom in to the hand painted small print on the bottom of the sign which reads freekz is a registered trademark of elijah c
any unauthorized reproduction is strictly prohibited without prior written consent
the car stops at the end of the long spooky driveway just past a sizzling electric fence
rick julie and ernie get out and look around
its eerily quiet
there is a large dilapidated mining shed complete with rusted ducts and a tall smoke stack a tattered carnival tent with an ornate stage flat facade a lopsided outhouse a
creepy broken down farm house and in the center of it all a giant molded carnival head with big staring eyes which slowly rotates on a creaky base
ernie looks hard at the big eyes
he turns away for a second then spins around again
the eyes are looking in a different direction
ernie shakes his head and unwraps a chocolate bar
isnt it great
its so real
this place is dead
where are all the weirdos
there are no weirdos here
startled they turn to see elijah c
skuggs a twisted haggard old man
he takes a bite out of an ice cream cone which contains the rear half of a chipmunk with a maraschino cherry on top
elijah has bad teeth a bad shave and scary eyes
we now realize the giant head is molded in his image
genetic nightmares definitely
children of hell and twisted masses of living breathing tormented flesh certainly
but as for weirdos
not a one
unless of course you count me
ha ha ha
nah you seem like a regular dumbshit old redneck to me
elijah ignores him
julie shoots him a look and smiles at elijah
and you are
skuggs proud proprietor of skuggs fabulous freak land and mutant emporium
but you knew that
after all youve ventured miles away from civilization hospitals telephones police
how may i help you
elijah smiles unfazed
julie glares at rick
she smiles apologetically at elijah
wed like to see your freak show
you see only by appreciating the variety and innovation of nature can we come to respect the fragile complexity of our global eco system
elijah nudges ernie
and you come to me looking for weirdos
he goes to take a bite out of his chocolate bar and finds only the empty wrapper left in his hand
what the he looks behind him and there about ten feet away is
warts all over squatting on the ground and chewing happily
this is toad
julie and rick turn and see him
composes herself and ahem
toad doesnt respond to her waves
toad is my
as for the show im afraid the next parade of deformity isnt until tomorrow night
rick and ernie pretend to be disappointed
they turn to leave
julies sincerely upset
oh just our luck
elijah grabs ricks shoulder and turns him around
i do have a private exhibit in my shed you might enjoy
i dont usually share it with the general public
were deeply honored
but no thanks
we really must be he raises his cigarette to his lips but its gone
he turns to see toad ten feet behind him puffing away happily
elijah is already leading julie towards the shed
the sideshow tradition has been misrepresented by the media
you dont traffic in human misery
you show society the part of itself it doesnt want to look at
yesm i see
he looks over to rick and ernie with a grin that says whered you find this nutty chick
rick shrugs and follows taking ernie with him
what the heck
well see some pickled dog brains maybe some pictures of women with you know added equipment
and to think we could be in the limo with those stewardesses
elijah holds the shed door open for them
its pitch black inside
rick and ernie follow
what the hell coog these people are weird but they seem nice enough
sits outside the shed
toad lashes out with his ten foot tongue and sucks the bunny into his mouth
he shuffles into the shed crunching contentedly
elijah closes the shed doors in our face grinning
we hear a lonq peal of evil laughter from inside
its dark and spooky
elijah stands in a pool of light reading a family circus cartoon in the funny pages
ha he he he
god i love the family circus
how do they do it day after day
he turns to
as toad finishes strapping them onto massive frankenstein style operating tables
they struggle desperately against well i guess they do use the same joke over and over
im just a sucker for that little moffets shenanigans thats all
he tosses the funnies but perhaps i should tell you a little more about what i do
you see i not only exhibit freaks i make them
just like michelangelo saw the angel in the stone i look at a guy like kevin costner and see a giant peach grub who can fart the blue danube
mops brow asks am i crazy or is it hot in here
rick julie and ernie shoot him a look that pretty well answers his question
elijah shrugs and goes back to his spiel
the tasty freekz machine
he pulls a tarp off a huge complicated machine
several drums and vats of various chemicals feed through a crude network of pipes gadgets and computers into an old tasty freeze soft serve ice cream machine the logo has
been changed to tasty freekz
the biggest vat reads noxon
hes using noxon twenty four
youre not supposed to have that stuff
well i guess im not supposed to have these either
he holds up a matching towel and washcloth embroidered with the ramada inn logo
rick julie and ernie gasp
he tosses the towels
as elijah gets worked up into a frenzy the ambience in the room becomes more and more horrific the sunlight is replaced by an eerie green glow a thunderstorm rumbles
to life a raven perches on the windowsill a rat scurries across the floor one of those plastic bony banks reaches out and grabs a quarter
i need only punch a few buttons on this magnificent device and it gives me an easy to apply ointment that will mutate a perfect young body bubble its skin
warp its bones and twist its guts into an elijahs hair is now standing on end
hes foaming at the mouth
a bolt of lightning and thunderclap cap the monologue
wait a minute
does this mean were not going to see a show
toad fire up that machine and lets turn these hapless asswipes into monstrosities
now lets see
who wants to get freaked first
points at julie ladies first
go screw yourself
if i were you i would
toad is adjusting some knobs on the machine
elijah steps past him to a jerry rigged computer console
he punches some keys and some rotating dna models appear on the monitor
mumbling to himself its like yin and yang
two birds with one stone
yeah its pretty darn good really
he presses enter and the computer beeps
let er rip toad
toad yanks a pull start cord and the machine rumbles to life
elijah pulls the tasty freekz lever and fills a small dish with phosphorescent ointment
toad cuts open their clothes exposing their sides and pushes them close together
wait a second
youre really gonna smear that stuff on us and mutate our body parts
then could you give me a really big rodney
im a mad scientist pal not a miracle worker
elijah smears the ointment on their exposed sides
their skin begins to bubble and undulate
a grapefruit sized lump pops up on ernies side then another on julies side and then the lumps do a little synchronized dance together
suddenly ernies flesh balloons out and melds into julies side
the mass of connected skin continues to bubble and mutate
odd shapes press up under four humans faces that quickly become mount rushmore
the pepsi logo pepsi the choice of a new generation
julie and ernie merge into one amorphous flesh blob which then takes the form of
demon versions of gumby and his magic horse pokey
gumbys got his back to camera
hes grabbing his crotch and flipping everyone off
put that thing away
gumby and pokey mutate back into a blob and then into
joined side to side their two heads on a single body which is split down the middle half julie half ernie
elijah wheels a large mirror in front of them
feast your eyes
well at least ill never have to go far for a piece of tail
she smacks him
i was just trying to keep things light
he starts blubbering uncontrollably
toad drags them towards the door
mother always said thered be days like this
and i thought she was nuts
elijah turns to rick
gestures to julie ernie a mere party trick
but you youre gonna be special
elijah steps over to the computer console and starts punching keys
let me go skuggs or else
i got some rick contd friends thatll come down here and mess you up bad homey
rick tries a different i got some other friends who can score you box seats at the superbowl no problem
switches gears again you ever had a hot fudge bath with morgana
foreign take madonna you know her
rick nods hopefully
elijah considers it for a moment then frowns
ah screw it
id never get anywhere with her
fire up toad starts the machine
elijah pulls the lever and dispenses a bowl full of glowing ointment
he carries it towards rick leering maniacally
for years ive strived to create the ultimate monster
the first of a whole new generation of superfreaks
now ive finally got you the perfect subject a real asshole
ha ha he pauses and looks closer at rick wait a minute
arent you the guy from hey dude three the beguiling
yeah thats me
you were great in that picture
oh well i guess for the next one theyll have to get christian slater
ha ha ha
elijah squishes the ointment into ricks horrified face
the barn looks especially sinister silhouetted against a big green moon
a huge ball of flame belches out of the smoke stack
its eerily quiet in the dawn light
extreme close up of ricks eye as it opens and searches the room frantically
close up of ricks hand a normal hand straining at the bonds
ricks pov groggily searches the lab and picks up the blurred image of elijah in the distance
hes on the phone speaking in hushed tones
this is red swan
may i speak to the laughing man
yes ill hold
for a moment elijah is entertained by hold music to the tune of freak out by chic
a mans laughing voice comes on the other end of the line
it laughs throughout the conversation
ive done it
i found the perfect subject huge ego shallow personality almost no moral values
yeah the guy from those hilarious hey dude movies
hahahaha laughing man has stopped laughing
elijah dummies up
well i liked em
laughing man resumes laughing
elijah listens intently
yes i see
but thats just it
hes not quite uh finished
i need more noxon so i can laughing man laughs so loudly elijah has to hold the phone away
geez what a grouch
over on the slab rick groans
hes waking up
to laughing man laughing man
i have to go
what about the noxon
great you can see everything then
yeah you take it easy too
elijah hangs up the phone and strides over towards rick
time to meet and greet the new you
he flips the slab right side up and holds up a mirror
ricks eyes widen in terror as he beholds his hideous new form
ricks left half has been transformed into a hideous bug eyed monster
the doors fly open
elijah drags rick out
horrified rick clutches the monster side of his face
this was my good side
still is if you ask me
hell even half done youll be the star of the show tonight
elijah stops in front of the tiny outhouse
welcome to your spacious accommodations
he unlocks the door and drags rick in
oddly the interior is a vast barracks fifty feet long and thirty feet high
rick looks around
great use of the space
i learned it all from bob vila
bob vila walks up next to elijah
you know you could expose those rustic beams and put in a skylight over one weekend elijah
give it a rest bob
he pushes bob away into the freak house gives rick a goodbye wink and walks out the door
elijah pauses and looks at the tiny outhouse
one of these days i gotta put a shitter in there
bob vila steps out of nowhere again holding a time life book
its all here in my beds and bathrooms book elijah
and you pay nothing for thirt bonk
elijah knocks him out cold with a ball peen hammer from his tool belt
it takes a few moments for ricks eyes to adjust to the dim light
theres nobody in sight
the walls are lined with dark cubicles stacked atop each other with walkways like prison cells
rick staggers to his feet and makes his way forward
over here coog
are you alright
rick sees the vague outline of julieernie a few yards away
i know that voice
thats the voice that said cool a freak show
lets check it out
oh sure blame the woman
its so real
is this real enough for you
im friggin quasimodo
chill out coog
youre talking to the original tag team of ugly pukes
step into the light
okay here i come
rick steps forward into a pool of light
julie and ernie are caught by surprise
julie struggles to keep her composure
ernie turns away and pukes on the floor
julie soldiers on
its not so gulp revolting
after all physical beauty is just a socially enforced myth that we uh oh shit
ulpi julie turns away and pukes on the floor
yeah well youre no mona lisas yourself
youre lucky ive got a strong stomach
and youre lucky i dont bite you
heh heh heh heh
rick wheels around to see juan the dog boy snickering behind him
juan is a hairy young mexican with a snout dog ears and canine teeth scrappy doo with an attitude
rick assumes a threatening pose
get away from me you you
ha ha hahahaha
he stares hard at rick i am juan the dog boy leader of the freaks
walks up to them kind of the top dog
juan scratches himself behind the ear with his hind leg
welcome to hell rick
he extends a hand to rick
rick doesnt take it
he hears a slight rustling noise from the direction of the cubicles and turns to look around the apparently empty freak house
i dont plan on staying long
how many of you are there in here anyway
juan shrugs mischievously and sticks his snout in ricks face
first i have a question for you ricardo
who starred in the film international velvet
well perhaps we should ask the worm
the top right cubicle lights up revealing the worm
he is a man with no arms and legs and the wrinkly slimy body of a worm
his face is learned looking with spectacles a small goatee and a pipe which he puffs on pompously
tell us worm who starred in international velvet
he puffs pensively on his pipe for a second
the perfectly appalling sequel to national velvet i believe
no dramatic verisimilitude whatsoever
but who was the star
the worm takes a long thoughtful drag on his pipe
rick do you agree or disagree
this is nuts
this is crazy
besides it was tatum oneill
it was tatum oneill now married to tennis star john mcenroe
circle gets the square
the lights come on in of the center cubicles silhouetting freaks in a full size hollywood squares x layout
the freaks applaud ricks success
worm nudges an into place in his cubicle with some difficulty
hes not happy about being proved wrong
no talent ragamuffin
okay julieernie your turn
whos it going to be
as juan names the freaks one by one their square is highlighted and they wave at rick cheerily
nosey the nose man
nosey is a man whose massive nose dominates his head
he blows into a huge hanky and waves it wearily at rick
cowboy is a young boy with cow like features a cowboy hat cowboy clothes and a full set of udders
the bearded lady
the bearded lady is a big tough bearded man in a blouse
he has lipstick earrings and tattoos on his muscular arms
gruff and masculine how ya doin
sockhead is a freak with a large button eyed sock puppet for a head
hes munching cookies which spill uselessly out of his throatless sock mouth
the human torch
the human torch is a man engulfed in flames
he waves apathetically
rosie the pinhead
rosie is a pinhead in dark sunglasses
she has a great bod jammed into a sexy dress
she smokes a cigarette demurely and waves a small arrogant big star wave
the hideous frog man
frogman is just a guy in a scuba outfit
he strikes a threatening monster pose then gives a friendly wave
and of course in the center square mr
suddenly the lighting changes to flashing red horror lights with plenty of dark shadows
theres a horrific music sting and we zoom in to a decomposing skeleton in the center cubicle
its eyeball drips out of the socket
well julieernie who will it be
call me old fashioned but ill go with paul lynde
dont be an idiot
they argue back and forth hitting and poking each other stooges style
juan turns to rick
you see rick
just because were freaks doesnt mean we cant have some fun huh
rick is overwhelmed by it all
he backs away
get away from me
im not like you
you hear me
im ricky coogan
i am not a freak
the freaks laugh in ricks face
he storms off
rick sits in a corner pondering his fate
oddly theres a shiny new pepsi machine in this dingy corner of the freak house
julieernie approach him
okay coog so i get twenty four hour access to t n a and you look like a plate of rancid giblets
were still pals right
rick shoots him a look
all the freaks have gone through this anguish rick
at first i was blinded by my anger
i admit it
i wanted to break your neck for getting me into this
but i got over it
juan taught me to channel my anger for the common good
it was your fault anyway
you wanted to see the freak show
she tries to wring his neck
rick glares at ernie
for a second there i was a total man hater
julie regains her cool
she takes out a pamphlet scribbles something on it and hands it to rick
rick examines the cover
he reads it aloud
so youre a hideous mutant freak now what
theres an scribbled on the pamphlet
were in cubicle eight
maybe later youll be ready to talk
im not like those other god forsaken animals
he throws the pamphlet to the ground just as the worm bearded lady and sockhead approach
they sit down in a circle around him
the worm looks down at the pamphlet and puffs thoughtfully on his pipe
youre mistaken rick
you are exactly like us
we were all normal healthy folk before we made the fateful mistake of visiting this hell hole at an off hour
why when i first came here
the worm as an oxford professor is wandering around the grounds taking notes and puffing on his pipe
i was a professor of lacrophylogy er the study of worms of course
i came in search of the epsosophecci dilepsidae in layman terms the fat pudgy worm
skuggs said he had just such a worm in his shed
how could i have surmised that the specimen and i would ultimately prove to be one and the same
we see professor worm meet elijah and follow him into the lab
the smoke stack belches a plume of flames as we hear his off camera screams
dissolve back to
the worm finishes his tale
at first the transformation was fabulous
i truly understood the worms ethos like never before
but those early days of fascination are over
now in retrospect i think the whole thing is a fucking headache
id sell my soul just to be able to wipe my own ass
he sniffles a little but manages to hold back the tears
we pan to sockhead
i first came here as a tourist looking for some fun
a lanky tourist obviously sockhead in better days
he approaches elijah
anyway then elijah turned me into a sock
sockhead shrugs apologetically
im not much for stories
the camera moves in on the bearded lady
when i arrived here i was nothing like i am now
the bearded lady as a man steps out of the cab of his eighteen wheeler
he looks very much like he does now except he has no lipstick or earrings
i was confused a walking contradiction so full of questions
he finishes his story
now i know who i am
i can say hey world
this is me
im a woman
and i like me
the others look at the bearded man uneasily
the camera pans past the bearded lady and moves in on an ordinary hammer lying on the ground
the hammer is placed on a shelf by a friendly stockboy
the music turns tense as elijah appears and scans the shelf
he makes eye contact with the hammer and smiles
he grabs the hammer roughly and shoves it in a plastic bag
the bag opens elijah reaches in and takes out the hammer
the music turns to psycho like string stabs as elijah uses the hammer to smash in a nail
everyone looks at the hammer sympathetically
rick turns away to wipe a tear from his eye
you are one of us now rick
whether you admit it or not
the worm shakes his head
the freaks turn and head back to their cubicles
rick exchanges a look with julie before she and ernie turn and head off
rick is left alone staring pensively at the hammer
hours later rick is still staring at the hammer
he picks it up and stares at it more closely
rick is still staring at the damn hammer
he nods with resolve
he spots the pamphlet on the ground picks it up dusts it off
he opens it and begins to read under the heading
its fun being ugly
rick closes the pamphlet looks at the number julie scribbled and nods with a sense of purpose
standing up he throws the hammer carelessly aside into the muck and walks towards the cubicles
rick walks past the cubicles
in one the bearded lady knits a sweater
he reaches cubicle and is about to speak when he hears julie giggling
there is a mans voice but not ernies
rick peeks around and sees julie scratching juans belly
he licks her face happily and she giggles with delight
ernie is reading the womans room trying not to notice all of this
rick watches disgusted
he tears up the pamphlet throws it to the ground and storms off to find his own cubicle
ernie peeks at julie and juan continuing their foreplay
juan stops abruptly
mind your business
ernie returns to his book
the camera pans up to ricks cubicle
hes sitting on his cot distractedly whittling a log with his knife like talon
he talks to himself making sure to be loud enough for julieernie and juan to hear
well that ees guy should rescue me any minute
then its straight to the plastic surgeon and back to sunny old l
i wonder how many of my beautiful anatomically correct girlfriends will be waiting for me
ill be waiting for you rick
rick looks up and sees a holographic image of stuey gluck floating in the air above him
a phantom troll
he swings the log wildly at the hologram but it keeps darting around dodging the blows
cowboy leans around the cubicle wall
he talks a lot like gomer pyle
seeing phantom trolls rick
rick stops swinging lamely pretends he was stretching and ignores stuey who hovers around him
sounds to me like youve developed a telepathic bond
dont mean yer nuts or nuthin
heck old nosey why he can smell the future
lots of us freaks got e
and sockhead hes got e
he points at sockhead whos watching pro wrestling on a portable tv
watch out hulk
hes gonna try the skull cracker
shucks rick youre lucky
telepathy like yours only occurs between real soulmates
a bond like that should be cherished
cowboy smiles and ducks back into his own cubicle
im ricky coogans soulmate
in your dreams
now get lost troll
he swings wildly at the hologram which starts to break up and fade away
waitll i tell the kids at school
cowboy leans into ricks cubicle again
shucksm rick it dont make sense to spurn your soulmate
i reckon that troll could help you if you just let him into your heart
rick scoffs at him and starts whittling again
its a cramped room filled with ricky coogan memorabilia
stuey is drawing a crude sketch of rick on a pad
this sequence is set to brassy man on a mission music
once america sees what happened to ricky theyll probably send the whole fbi down to save him
stuey marches towards a frosted glass door that reads the
ill probably win a pulitzer prize for this scoop
and ill dedicate it to rick
he walks through the door
he comes flying out through the glass and lands on his butt
the time magazine door smash
stuey flies out through it
today door smash
stuey flies out through it
the weekly world news door we see stuey and an editor silhouetted against the glass
of course ill print it
america needs to know
give mister gluck his fee and show him out
i know the way
stuey dives through the glass door
stuey proudly reads the weekly world news
the front page features stueys story and his sketch of rick
ricky coogans a mutant in south america
by stuart s
to newsstand guy thats me
suddenly two goons in dark suits snatch the paper away from stuey
they grab him and force him into a limousine
the goons hold stuey in between them
we hear the low menacing chuckle of the laughing man whos off screen
the camera is his pov
heh heh heh heh hehh heh
sure i wrote the article
but ha ha ha
youve got it all wrong
i dont know anything about that
you gotta believe me
ho ho hahahaha hee hee hoohaaa
cruises off down the street
we hear a power drill stueys screams and laughing mans hearty cackle from inside
rick has whittled his log down to a toothpick
he admires it then leans over and fits it into an intricate three foot scale model of the eiffel tower made entirely out of toothpicks
the human torch walks by
wow what a great model
he points at a toothpick but look this ones crooked
he reaches out to fix it and woof
the whole model burns to a cinder
rick looks at him hatefully
elijah steps into the freakhouse
get ready for the glamour
get ready for the glitz
get ready to be pelted with rotten vegetables cause its showtime
elijah looking natty in his ringmaster suit stands at the entrance barking to various people who are drifting in
itll make you wish you were dead
and at just twelve bucks a head you can bring all the kids
we follow a kindly father through the curtained entrance
he collapses a knife embedded in his chest revealing the total mayhem
the motley crowd locals sleazy looking mobsters rogue bikers wayward hippies and japanese tourists etc
is brawling and drinking and having a heck of a time
some small displays and a few carnival booths are set up around the sides of the tent
theres a petting zoo where a kid is petting a two tailed no headed dog
and theres a heavy petting zoo where a guy is french kissing a six legged goat
a clown sits in a dunk tank heckling the customers
the sign says dunk me in acid
cmon my granny could throw better than you
hes talking to an old lady who throws a baseball hits the target and dunks the clown into the foaming bath of carbolic acid
we hear his gurgling screams then his bony hand reaches up out of the bath
elijah walks out on stage and looks at the rowdy audience
its total mayhem
everyone instantly sits down shuts up and looks up obediently at elijah
ladies and gentlemen you are about to witness a cavalcade of atrocities so horrific i advise the more sensitive members of our audience to leave the premises
two sensitive looking men wearing sweaters draped over their shoulders politely get up and leave
tonight im proud to announce the addition of several new monstrosities to the show including our star attraction the beast boy an untamed and highly dangerous ghoul whos liable to
go nuts and kill us all at the drop of a hat
impressed oohs ahhs and cools from the but first up prepare to behold an unspeakably repulsive yet heartwarming atrocity three men and a baby
three men and a baby all fused into a single multi limbed freak walks out onstage
one of its arms holds up a dirty diaper and all the three men hold their noses and grimace
the audience breaks into warm hearted laughter and applause
the freaks mill around in the caged in green room guarded by toad
frogman dressed in a magicians outfit over his wetsuit holds an empty dove cage and searches the room whistling for his missing dove
nosey sneezes up a cloud of feathers
julieernie walk determinedly towards the adjacent mens and womens restrooms
they hit the wall between the two doors
rick is reading his script rehearsing his lines
hes wearing a cheesy jungle costume
i am beast boy
i will eat you
he throws down the i cant do this shit
he peers through the bars scanning the audience for signs
of a rescue party
whats keeping those guys
the worm creeps up behind rick
somethings troubling you my boy
what is it
well lets see
ive been kidnapped hideously disfigured imprisoned with a bunch of mutant freaks my rescue party is m
and this dialogue makes hey dude three read like dr
i think i know what youre going through
i too had an eating disorder
you see ive always had a feverish obsession with pudding
and when i was a young lad
rick groans and looks out at the audience
and now a perennial favorite here at freakland ladies and gentlemen
i know youll all enjoy the musical stylings of rosie the pinhead
rosie the pinhead struts out wearing a sexy dress and holding a microphone
after the applause dies down she whips off her sunglasses with a flourish revealing her extremely goofy looking crossed eyes
she wails incomprehensibly and bonks her head with the mic
a series of wipes show bits of various acts as the evening are doing a vaudeville style stand up routine while tap dancing
hey julie how many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb
one to screw it in and one to ride my rodney
ha ha ha
she bonks him with their cane
he bonks her back
she knocks him cold
they both fall down
is doing a make over demonstration
hes got a local girl from the audience sitting at a makeup table onstage
if your coloring is in the autumn range like marias try an earth tone eye makeup
now ive done a lovely french braid on maria but i encourage everyone to experiment and use your imagination
the main thing is to just have fun with it
the audience is engrossed
some take notes
is ringing those tuned bells and singing along
he takes a bow but his sock is snagged on the mic stand
it pulls off and reveals a normal sized hand where the sockhead was hes actually a hand head
the audience gasps
a man gets up and points accusingly
hes got a hand under there
its a hoax
sockhead realizes hes unveiled and tries to hide his hand head with his other hands
the crowd starts jeering and pelting sockhead with rotten vegetables
he gives them the finger with all three hands
elijah tries to calm them
puppetteering is an admirable skill in its own right
give him his due
wheres the beast boy you promised us
bring on the beast boy
we want the beast boy
the worm is still talking to rick
we can hear the crowd screaming for him in the background
and when i won first prize they never called me pudding head again
dont you see
you must turn your hardship into inspiration
youre an actor rick
your body is your instrument and with it you must play your tragic symphony for all the world
rick is really moved
elijah pokes his head backstage
theyre going nuts for you beast boy
you better go out there now
he starts to take off his jungle costume
determined inspired ill be right there
thank you worm
i dont really know how i can repay you for this
you could wipe my ass
thinks worm is joking ha ha
always the wit eh worm
rick claps him on the back and walks off
worm is disappointed
he turns to nosey nosey have i ever told you what a gifted artist you are
nosey gives him a worried look
the spotlight reveals rick centerstage poised in shakespearean garb
the crowd quiets down and focuses on rick with great respect and awe
a truly dramatic silence
rick pauses for effect and then launches into a soliloquy with bravura
now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this son of york but i that am not shaped for sportive tricks nor made to court an amorous
looking glass i that am curtailed of this fair proportion cheated of feature by dissembling nature the audience is riveted
even spanish speaking peasants are mouthing the words
elijah however thumbs through his script totally confused
the freaks watch through the bars from the wings completely engrossed especially julie
juan notices this and pulls her closer to him but she pushes him away
we move in on an erudite british gentlemen in the crowd
its alistair cooke
he turns to camera
subtitle if youre having trouble understanding mr
coogans brilliant reading of this soliloquy from richard the third please take advantage of the handy subtitles for the culturally illiterate
a filthy peasant sitting next to cooke is trying to listen to rick
he turns angrily to cooke
cooke turns back to the stage
the words in brackets appear as subtitles
deformed unfinished sent before my time into this breathing world scarse half made up and that so lamely and unfashionable that dogs bark at me as i halt by them
why i in this weak piping time of peace have no delight to pass away the time unless to see my shadow in the sun and descant on mine own
the crowd bursts into applause
they yell bravo and throw bouquets
rick takes several curtain calls
the freaks cheer for him
julie is particularly moved she and rick exchange a heavy look laden with romantic potential
note we will insert an almost subliminal one frame shot of the pepsi logo at this triumphant moment
kevin the ees executive from the airport scene walks into the tent
rick sees him and gasps with joy
he leaps off the stage runs up to kevin and hugs him
kevin is shocked of course
overcome by the moment rick regresses to his old self
you sorry mutants are gonna rot in this hole while im sipping mint juleps by the pool
the freaks and the audience gasp at ricks cruelty
julie is shocked juan gives her an i told you so look
rick sees julie and catches himself
i mean um i hope you have room for all my friends heh heh
rick rick listen i really love this new look youve come up with
but just between you and me i dont think the guys upstairs would really get it
what are you saying
im saying youre ugly enough to burn the nosehairs off a dead nun
the crowd bursts into cruel hysterics pointing mockingly at rick
even alistair cooke is practically choking with laughter
rick looks around horrified at the sea of evil jeering faces
he begins to tremble
springs to life for the first time and glows red with rage
his whole monster side awakens and takes charge of his body with violent intensity
he grabs kevins head and screams in a new monstrous voice
he plucks kevins head off his neck and holds it aloft
the head stares down at rick in disbelief
now youre just being childish
rick serves the head like a volleyball smashing it to bits
the crowd panics and charges for the exits
people are trampling over each other in the mayhem
alistair cooke is crushed under the stampede
the freaks are horrified
monster rick growls triumphantly
elijah looks on intrigued
now thats entertainment
rick awakens with a start and gets up
he approaches julieernie the bearded lady nosey and dog boy who are idly playing a game of wheel of fortune
the cubicles contain large blank blocks like the letters on the game show
so far theres a d two s s and a k revealed
rosie the pinhead plays vanna whites role
id like to buy a vowel
the bearded lady yawns
rick edges towards them
mind if i sit in
juan advances towards rick sneering
now you dont mind mixing with us how did you say it sorry mutants
im sorry for what happened at the show
cant you just forget it
he shakes his finger at juan and notices theres still a human nose stuck on his monster claw
he wipes it off embarrassed
theres an awkward pause
ernie breaks the silence
hey shouldnt you tell rick about your big escape plan
juan gives ernie a nasty shut up look
he growls at him
well excuse me for living
you have an escape plan
listen beast boy the games are a simple diversion
beneath our twisted flesh we freaks cry out for freedom
juan howls lustily
he looks to rest of the freaks
theyre a pathetic lot and their half hearted howl proves it
juans plan is really ingenious rick
see he figured out that i figured out that our escape does not include the beast boy
no one may discuss the plan with him understand
juan gives the others a threatening look
they mumble agreement
whats the matter with all of you
you trust your lives to a guy just cause he can lick his own privates
the freaks ponder this a second then nod yes
you gotta admit coog its a helluva trick
ill just come up with an escape plan of my own then
i have spent a year studying this hellhole devising the perfect escape
you think youll just tango right out the door
just try it amigo
rick turns to go
julieernie rush over and try to reason with him quietly
dont go off half cocked
believe me it aint all its cracked up to be
this isnt one of your dumb movies coogan
look juans a good dog a smart dog
ill talk to him
dont be stupid rick
you cant do it without us
i dont need you ees or anybody else
ill get out of here all by myself you
crud sucking pus monkeys
ding ding ding
the letters in the wheel of fortune board light up and rosie turns them over to reveal crud sucking pus monkeys as the secret phrase
everyone claps despite themselves
juan stares them down
rick storms off in a huff
juan takes julies hand and gazes deep into her eyes
he kisses her passionately
julie is watching rick leave
juan nibbles her neck which gets her attention
she scratches juan behind his ear
his leg instinctively kicks the air
ernie looks worried
im getting a bad feeling here
out of sight from the others rick approaches the rear door and tries it
it doesnt open from the inside
he peers out through a crack in the door and sees a milkman getting out of his truck in the driveway
the milkman looks over at the outhouse suspicious
just the man im lookinq for
be a pal and give me a hand will ya
i know you freaks
youll try anything just to get someone to open that door
well not me
hes about to walk away
guess ill just have to milk the worlds biggest breasted woman all by myself
sorry to bother you
the milkman stops in his tracks
he tiptoes over to the back door of the outhouse listening intently as rick goes into his act
in a lusty womanish ooohh
milk me now
milk me hard
normal rick voice ive only got two hands all right
i dont care if elijah did give you skim milk on the right side chocolate on the left and eggnog in the middle
the milkman is salivating at the door
gee i love eggnog
the milkman opens the door eagerly and steps inside
hey what the bonk
we hear the sound of bottled buttermilk beaning his soft noggin
rick walks out wearing the milkman outfit complete with the little six milk bottle carrier thing
he looks around and heads for the milk truck whistling casually
he notices something
its big eyes are staring at rick note theres a skywriter plane in the distance behind the head which finishes writing you got the right one baby pepsi rick gets
to the truck and tries the door
he looks over at the giant head
the eyes are still staring at him they seem to have shifted
rick shrugs it off and looks around
he walks over to elijahs car
its locked too
he checks the big eyes
theyve moved again
ricks getting a bit desperate
he sees something else and runs towards it
its a dry docked motorboat
its locked too
the eyes have followed rick again
he sees something else and runs over to it
its a bag of golf clubs leaning against elijahs porch
theyre locked too
this guy doesnt trust anybody
he looks at the giant head the eyes are gone leaving only empty eyesockets
rick hears a burst of machinegun fire behind him spins around and faces
with little arms and legs wearing jamaican rasta hats and aiming smoking uzi mms in the air
they aim their uzis at rick
one holds a walkie talkie the other holds a big spliff
monitor in elijahs hands shows rick staring at us the eyes pov
seen in extreme close up watches the surveillance monitor
he speaks into a microphone
we dont see what the room looks like
good work eye and eye
bob in response to elijah
they have no mouths but their pupils open and close when they speak
over the walkie talkie now bring the beast boy to my uh den
ha ha ha ha
rick looks worried as they lead him towards the scary looking house
its a lovely suburban den with a coffee table full of magazines like better homes and gardens national review and freaks illustrated
elijah sits in a big barcalounger smoking a pipe
rick sits on the sofa
toad walks up with a tray of soft drinks
elijah points to a bowl of fiddle faddle
toad sits beside rick
rick shakes his head you sure
he scoops some into his well are you gonna torture me or kill me or something
torture my greatest creation ever
kill the final piece of the puzzle that ive been putting together for years
sure itd be fun but ive got a bigger plan my boy
and when you ripped off that guys head i knew it was working like gangbusters
but i thought i scared everyone away
and then they told two friends and they told two friends and so on and so on
look at this
elijah grabs a big mail bag and spills some letters out on the table
elijah opens one and reads it
dear mister skuggs i was shocked and disgusted when my grandson told me about the head popping beast at your show
please send me six tickets
he reads another dear beast boy i used to like new kids on the block but youre way cuter
my favorite ice cream is chocolate
is it fun ripping peoples heads off
i love you
the beast boy is on a blood letting spree and oscar is along for the ride
he looks up at rick that ones from pat collins
yeah but she loves everything
rick reaches for the fiddle faddle but the bowl is empty
that fiddle faddle is for guests only
youve had enough
toad is blankfaced
elijah walks over and refills the bowl
rick scoops some into his mouth
elijah walks to the fireplace and pushes the embers around with a poker
look skuggs elijah ive been in show business all my life
the public does not want to see disgusting depraved violent filth
oh and i suppose jake and the fatman is just a fluke
the phone rings
elijah looks at it and back to rick
ill get it
he goes over to the phone and lifts the receiver
on the other end of the line we hear laughing mans insane chuckle
elijahs smooth smile fades
he turns his back to rick who strains to identify the familiar laughing voice
elijah scribbles notes on a pad by the phone
you got it
hasta la vista to you too
hahaahahaahaha laughing man hangs up on elijah
he looks a little pissed off as he turns to face rick again
grumbling he takes the poker in hand and pokes at the coals angrily
im finished with you for now
ricky rises and snatches the notepad just before elijah spins to face him
i may not be mr
tinseltown but i damn well know what i like
youre gonna be a hideous killing machine and thats final
tomorrow night ill finish the job onstage
and then to demonstrate your horrible power youll slaughter all the old obsolete freaks in cold bl hey
elijah thrusts the red hot fire poker out and zap
he catches toads ten foot tongue curled around the searing poker inches from the fiddle faddle
i told you enough
elijah shows rick out the door
the eyes scurry out and leap back into the sockets in the giant head
and remember try another escape and ill feed your balls to toad
as he walks towards the freak house rick pulls out the note he pocketed
a gust of wind blows it away from him
he chases it behind the carnival tent where
he runs into eleven phony milkmen backing their way around the corner each carrying their own six pack of milkbottles
startled they turn around
why its the freaks
and theyre all dressed as milkmen
cowboy carries the hammer whos dressed in a little milkman suit as well
hey rick i thought you were gonna come up with your own escape plan
this is your big plan
a dozen milkmen
isnt that a little unusual
juan hadnt thought of this
he pushes himself forward and confronts rick viciously
twelve milkmen is theoretically possible
thirteen is silly
looks like one milkman too many coogan
he pushes rick aside
the freaks continue past him
hope you like reggae ya flea bitten bastard
rick watches as the freaks approach the open courtyard where he knows the eyeballs will spot them
julie glances at him a second then looks away
his mind made up rick takes a deep breath
he runs over to the freaks
he stands in juans way
look youll all be killed
you dont know about elijahs giant rasta eyeballs with machine guns
they think hes nuts its suicide
i cant let you do it
and i cant let you stop us
this is it
rick and juan square off
juan growls and bares his teeth
ricks monster eye starts to glow and pulse dimly
they circle each other
the others are transfixed
he peers through a side window and sees the pack of milkmen cheering two of their coworkers locked in mortal combat
thats a lot of milkmen on the same route
no wonder they fight
juan rears back about to lunge when suddenly he freezes and looks off into the distance
is sitting innocently a few yards off
he zooms off after the squirrel
the eyes pop out of the giant head and follow after him uzis firing
juan dodges their bullets and disappears after his prey
the freaks watch their best chance of freedom run off after a pesky rodent
they turn to rick
wow giant rasta eyeballs just like rick said
gosh if it wasnt for rick wed all be dead
way to go rick
god i cant believe he left you for a squirrel
what a dick
she doesnt even smack ernie
you know how men are
besides it was a pretty good looking squirrel
julie looks at rick
she sees hes trying to be helpful not sarcastic
to the others come on
you heard the beast boy
back to the freak house now
her eyes meet ricks
she manages a smile and rick smiles back
ernie sizes up the situation and groans as they all head back to the freak house
oh well at least well get to try a new position
were moving in towards a door in this desolate vaguely corporate looking hallway
were looking at the back of laughing mans leather chair
we hear his cackle as well as stuey glucks tortured screams and a horrible power tool noise
we can see the usual bright interrogation spotlight and a couple of extra goons watching the goings on but stuey and his actual torturer are hidden by laughing mans chair
we move past mr
bigs chair to reveal stuey lying face down on a table while bob vila is using a power sander on his butt
bob is happily giving pointers to the two goons
notice the way i use an elliptical motion to chafe stueys buttocks
the goons nod its all here in my new book pipes fixtures and torturing loud sharp laugh bob obediently shuts up
laughing man directs a sinister low chuckle to stuey
ill never talk
im made of stone
bob considers this a second then starts up a jackhammer
we hear lonesome harmonica music as we pan past the cubicles
cowboy is playing the harmonica
the bearded lady unties the pretty pink ribbon in his hair and sets it aside
suddenly we switch to horrific psycho stings as the camera picks up paul lyndes corpse with flashing red lights
his eyeball drips out of the socket again
then its back to the sad harmonica music
in the next cubicle ernie is sleeping julie is awake dreamily fondling a large eclair
she looks longingly up towards ricks cubicle as we
rick his face is normal and julie kiss passionately in a billowy white bed amidst puffy clouds
julie compared to this sex with julia roberts was a thankless chore
we follow her gaze panning up to rick
hes lying on his bed dreamily fondling a donut
he looks down towards julies cabin
rick and julie kiss passionately
were tight on them
oh rick youve touched a place in me no one has ever touched before
almost punctured a kidney
widen to show ernie still attached to julie leering at rick
rick is mortified
rick sits in his cubicle visibly sickened by his daydream
stueys echoey voice drifts in
a holographic image of stuey lying on the torture table appears over rick
we can see the jackhammer looming over stueys face
rick looks alarmed
its up to you rick
aha hee hee ho ho har har har
the laughing man
rick watches the hologram break up and disappear
wheels spinning in his head he takes the crumpled piece of paper out of his pocket and reads it
under his breath holy shit
julie and ernie are struggling over a bottle of deodorant
it says its strong enough for a man
but its made for a woman
she grabs it away and shoves it in ernies mouth
rick walks in
i grabbed it from skuggs office
he hands her the notepaper
she reads it with some difficulty
ernie is still gagging on deodorant
renew subscription to beaver world
she gives rick a disgusted look
ernie mumbles with the deodorant in his mouth
interested muffled beaver world
julie smacks him he swallows the deodorant
prepare demonstration for laughing man receive five thousand barrels of noxon
five thousand barrels
elijahs up to something big and we have to stop him
rick sniffs the air
rick takes a deep breath and begins his presentation to the freaks assembled before him
alright guys listen up sockhead suddenly freaks out
were done for
were done for
i dont want to die
its the end of the world
everyone is staring at him
i havent said anything yet
im not much for timing
he takes his seat again
tomorrow night at the show ill be turned into a homicidal monster and forced to kill you all
but we might have a chance if we act fast
and im prepared to be your new leader
i say we kill him
and ive got a plan
i still say we kill him
sockhead nods again
if we can get into elijahs lab maybe we can of course
design a super freak of our own and manipulate the genetic code to make him destroy elijah instead of us
well but how do we get to the lab
um maybe right
the worm could dig a tunnel
by god its so crazy it might just work
but you need noxon to make the freaking sludge and elijah told us himself hes run out of it
well see what i was going to say was
if theyve been using noxon as a fertilizer here the entire ecosystem must be soaked with it
all we need is a way to extract it from the vegetation ideally into a liquid form
well what about golly
so thats why my milk comes out that funny green color
i thought the grass tasted funny
wow rick youre a genius
good thinking rick
the freaks all nod in agreement
way to go rick
how did you ever think of such a plan
rick pulls out an old comic book and points to an ad for sea monkeys
well actually i was going to suggest we send away for sea monkeys train them to fire guns and make a break for it
but if you want to go with this other thing i guess thats okay
the freaks stare at him not sure if hes kidding or not
nosey milks cowboy squirting the glowing milk into a funnel which feeds into a crude still
the torch heats the boiler
the worm digs the tunnel
julieernie hand rick pieces of wood which he puts into place as tunnel supports
they hand him paul lyndes corpse and he wedges it in as well
everyones getting into it and working up a sweat
nosey wipes his brow opens a bottle of pepsi and chugs it down in a beautifully lit slo mo product shot
the other freaks follow suit including the worm down in the tunnel who struggles to hold the bottle in his tiny feeler
everythings going great and the song is really pumping when
runs out on his front porch in his nightclothes and screams down at the outhouse
nosey turns off a boom box and the music cuts short
the freaks exchange tense looks
nosey calls out apologetically to elijah
to the freaks what a jerk
the worm burrows along leaving a tunnel wide enough for rick and julieernie to crawl after him
rick notices a ray of light coming through a rock formation
hey look at this
they all stop and look
rick fingers the hole and the rocks cave in revealing its obviously a matte painting
its the lost city of nodd
we hear the sound of a slide projector switching slides and the underground city is replaced by a still image of some tourists standing around a geyser
foriegn version the blarney stone
its old faithful
foriegn take its the blarney stone
they ooh and ahh
the image switches to a snapshot of a its my aunt gladys
the other freaks nod politely
the image switches to a bar and thats me at my bar mitzvah
cmon ernie lets go
wait you gotta see the ones from sleep away camp
julie smacks him
its an antfarm view of the yard where the freaks are visible tunneling underground and toad is visible on the yard above them
we see a bat fly overhead
toad shoots out his tongue snags it out of mid air and chews it happily oblivious to the freaks burrowing right underneath him
nosey looks at the nearly full container of distilled noxon
he sniffs the air but wait im getting a whiff of things to come
what do you smell
bearded lady looks grave
nosey sniffs again
and hot buttered popcorn
theyre burrowing along
ernie loudly clears his throat
julie spits out a loogie
i hate when you do that
we hear muffled barking
do you hear that
its a dog
the worm breaks through into a small cavern with several exposed sewer pipes
a lovable mutt leaps out of a pipe and drops an old tennis ball in front of rick
he starts licking ricks face
sappy music wells up
its been ten years since you chased this ball into the sewer
i thought you were gone for good
scrappy runs away into the sewer pipe
you never know
julie taps on some exposed wood on the cavern ceiling
look a wood floor
it must be the lab
weve done it
they all look at each other excitedly
suddenly elijahs voice rings out behind them
not so fast you scabrous freaks
they spin around and see nosey holding the bottle of noxon
didnt know i did impressions did ya
the freaks are waiting around the hole
nosey pops out
theyve got the noxon and theyll be in the lab within minutes
boy this is going like clockwork
everyone smiles pats each other on the back etc
except sockhead who finally snaps
cant you see were digging our own graves
its nuts sockhead contd thats what it is
well maybe youve all got a deathwish but you can count me out
im getting the hell out of he runs amok pushes various freaks to the ground and runs around screaming
the freak house door opens eye and eye step in to check out the noise
one of them has a spliff sticking out of its pupil
sockhead charges at them like a mad dog
they aim their uzis
at the eyes ratta ratta ratta
they spray an ungodly amount of bullets into sockhead
he falls to the ground
the eyes leave
the freaks gather around sockhead
nosey pulls the sock off his hand head which is making a little senor pepe face with its fist
it spits up a trickle of blood and tries to speak
what is it kid
ah forget it
im not much for dying
he goes limp
julieernie the worm and rick are just emerging from the hole
its really dark in the lab
i cant see a damn thing
keep your voice down ernie
dont push me coog
i got a real short fuse today
im cranky bloated got a wicked case of cramps
dont ask why
whispers to rick has to think about this oh
rick pats ernie on the shoulder reassuringly
he moves over to elijahs computer terminal
well here it is the control panel for elijahs freaking process
good work my boy
now step aside
this is scientists work
worm muscles rick out of the way and sits at the console
using a pen held in his mouth he flicks a series of switches and punches a fast series of computer keys
the light on top of the tasty freekz machine starts to revolve and after a couple of seconds a stream of gooey light brown glop oozes out of the spigot
you did it worm
way to go
you didnt even use the noxon
the worm rushes over to the container of glop below the spigot and without hesitation plunges his face into it
rick julie and ernie gasp in horror
the worm lifts his glop smeared face out of the bowl and smacks his lips in delight
you dont need noxon to make butterscotch pudding
i just wanted to test the machines capabilities
the worm is lost in his pudding induced reverie
they ignore him
julie turns to rick
hang on rick
do you really think we should put this toxic glop on you
what if it doesnt work
what if something goes wrong
what if it does work do you think therell be enough left over to give me a monster size rodney
julie goes to doink ernie in the eyes but he uses the classic three stooges handblock
here hold this
rick hands the container of noxon to ernie
julie gives him the eyepoke
rick shakes hands with julie and takes back the noxon
to julie heroically look ive been a freak all my life
i realize that now
up there on that screen humiliating myself for every fool with six bucks in his pocket seven bucks
sometimes seven fifty
it doesnt matter
sure it does
they dont let you into the theater if you dont pay the price of the ticket
look im talking about the ultimate human sacrifice
when you consider money for parking popcorn drinks
the worm chimes in still gorging himself on pudding
dont forget a sitter for the children
ricks had enough
in case you havent noticed im about to commit a noble and selfless act here
rick pounds the table sending a glass beaker flying
it smashes through the window setting off a loud siren
elijahs in his robe watching the opening of crooked cops on tv
on screen is a revolving police beacon on a beat up car with a loud siren
elijah munches his popcorn happily
julie manages to silence the alarm by yanking the cord out of its socket
she shoots rick a hard look he shrugs innocently
lets do what we came to do and this time no more screw ups
rick slams his hand down for emphasis and impales it on one of those desktop paper pins
he screams in agony
elijahs watching an old war movie a soldier is running across a battlefield with a bayonet screaming
he doesnt hear rick
julie has her hand over ricks mouth silencing his scream
he calms down
he gingerly slides the pin out of his hand grimacing but not making a sound
he sighs with relief
the coast seems clear
then in slow motion his hand knocks a styrofoam cup off the desk and onto the ground
the war movie has erupted into a massive battle machine guns blaring grenade launchers and bazookas booming the works
suddenly his ears perk up and his head swivels around towards the window
he puts on his smiley face robe and bunny slippers and heads out the door
julie is pouring the distilled noxon into the top of the tasty freekz machine
dont you think we should make some more pudding first as a test
he presses some buttons on the computer and the tasty freekz machine starts humming
ernie is looking out the window
we have to wait
theres no way to speed up the machine
elijah comes out of the house and walks towards the lab
ricks starting to sweat
he looks over at julie who holds an empty pepsi cup under the tasty freekz spigot
a drop of ointment drips out and into the container
here it comes
begins to turn slowly
the flow of ooze slows to a stop
its plugged up
they look over at the doorknob its still turning
if its your damn pudding ill ring your wormy neck
under his breath preposterous
i have no neck
im a worm imbecile
is still turning agonizingly slowly
elijah is trying to turn the knob his grip keeps slipping because of the butter on his fingers
damn buttered popcorn
the spigot has started to discharge more reliably
the pepsi cup is filling up now
elijah is wiping his hands off on his shirt tails
he tries the door knob again
we hear a low rumbling and the floor starts to shake
the tunnel walls are about to collapse
you go ahead
ill catch up
the door knob is turning more vigorously but still not opening
julie and ernie get in the hole with worm while rick attends to the almost full pepsi cup of sludge
elijah is still having trouble with his grip
rick pops the plastic lid onto the pepsi cup and climbs into the hole
he rests the cup on the floor and lifts the floor board over his head
the rumbling gets louder as the tunnel walls start to crumble
rick is losing his balance as the ground shifts beneath him
he sways and knocks the pepsi cup of sludge rolling
he watches helpless as it rolls across the floor and comes to a stop across the room
for a second he contemplates making a dash
elijah has wrapped his shirt tails around the knob and finally has a good grip
he twists the knob
rick sees the door opening
he dives down into the hole
the floor board falls into place just as elijah walks in
elijah scans the room
he goes over towards the tasty freekz machine and finds the styrofoam cup
bad for the environment
he crumples it in his hand
the antfarm view again
we see the freaks running back through the tunnel as it caves in behind them
toad sits on the ground above oblivious to them
we hear a low flying aircraft
toad shoots his tongue up out of frame and sucks the twin engine cessna into his mouth
he burps and spits up a propeller
the freaks wait by the mouth of the tunnel
we hear the rumble approach
the worm julieernie and finally rick scramble out of the opening
the dirt avalanche is stopped short by paul lyndes corpse just as rick scrambles to safety
just made it
paul saved our lives
way to go paul
nosey claps paul on whats left of his back his skeleton shatters and the tunnel collapses burying him instantly
the freaks are horrified
turns to them guiltily in slow motion
his voice is slowed down and distorted like john lennon at the end of strawberry i
back to normal speed
this is no time to lament over a cadaver
weve got to get moving or were history
nosey is still morose
he speaks backwards and sounds a lot like revolution
daed si luap
subtitle paul is dead
i said enough
okay listen up everybody
we cracked the code and made the ointment we need to bring skuggs down for good
the freaks applaud and cheer
but we left it in the lab
the freaks jeer and pelt rick with rotten vegetables
he desperately pulls a bag of cookies out of his pocket
i found some macaroons
and theres plenty for all of us
the freaks burst into applause again
the freaks are all sleeping macaroon crumbs still left on their faces
theres a lot of snoring
rick awakens with a start
he hears something in the distance
something like a helicopter
he gets up and peeks out a crack in the wall
an ees corporate helicopter touches down
a few gun toting security guys in dark suits and dark glasses get out
they check that the coast is clear then give the signal
out steps richard hertz
he mutters something to one of the security guys and walks towards the freak house
under his breath i dont believe it
whats hertz doin here
the door to the freak house opens
hertz enters unzips his fly
finding no toilet he shrugs and relieves himself on the floor
rick steps out of the shadows towards him
so ees is in bed with elijah c
hertz is momentarily startled by rick
he collects himself
thank god i got to you in time
cut the crap hertz
hertz relieves himself as he talks
ricky you have no idea how your misfortune has touched our hearts
when you disappeared we almost gave up hope
but wed heard reports of skuggss reckless abuse of noxon and when the story broke in the tabloids i decided to personally come down and get to the bottom of
he zips up and heads to the door
the cackle is unmistakable ricks face twists in horror as he realizes
hertz is the laughing man
hertz ducks out the door
rick looks after him stunned
we hear a nearby snore cut off and the human torch stands up from the spot where hertz relieved himself
hes dripping wet and no longer on fire
he sniffs his soaked smoldering clothing
of all the
that really pisses me off
he catches fire again and walks off
rick is doing a slow burn still looking after hertz
he erupts and his monster eye glows briefly
he screams in anguish
dejected rick leans against the wall
julieernie walk up behind him
julie puts a hand on ricks shoulder to comfort him
as they look into each others eyes a loud crash distracts them
rick peers through the crack
a caravan of ees trucks crash through the front gate and drive up to the lab
theres a few cargo trucks and a huge noxon tanker
a forklift drives out of the back of one of the large trucks carrying the old corporate farts on a wooden palette
one of them falls off and a bunch of workmen scramble out to prop him up and push him back into place
elijah switches on the lights and turns to face his audience
hertz is accompanied by his stone faced security men and various executives
workmen are busy installing the old board of directors and their arm raising pulley system
nice to see you in the flesh laughing man
no need to use codenames elijah
were all friends here
and just to prove it i brought you a little present
hertz snaps his fingers and nods to a security guy who produces a wriggling canvas sack
he dumps its contents onto the lab table its stuey gluck
his glasses come tumbling out after him
he squints at the security guy
is that you
whos the troll
he was asking questions about coogan causing trouble
we figured he was one of yours
stuey puts on his glasses
elijah looks him up and down
i make freaks alright but come on fellas this things pathetic
well youre no julio iglesias yourself mister
riii rick hears stueys voice in his head all echoey
oh no not now stuey
the ghostly image of stuey gradually takes shape in front of rick
rick can make out the lab table stueys on and some shadowy figures in the background
thats elijahs lab
are you really in the lab
stuey is still wailing and everybody else is getting pretty damn annoyed
im in the lab
im in the lab
not only ugly hes crazy too
toad grabs stuey and slaps a piece of tape over his mouth
he throws him into one of the chicken cages along the far wall
a two headed chicken starts to peck at him
so where were we
gentlemen im not going to bullshit you
i know my setup here at freakland looks like small potatoes
he pulls the cover off a small scale model of freakland about ten inches high
it shows the stage lab outhouse the head everything
but thanks to your noxon and my genius tonight i will turn ricky coogan into a freak so hideous itll be enough to turn your stomach inside out boil your
brain in its own juice and cause cold sores you thought had healed up to start buggin you again
the ees men shift its the dawning of a new age for us all
behold super mega freak world
he whisks the cover off another scale model its exactly the same as the little model except its a lot bigger
its really somethin huh
well kick disneys dead ass
rick is watching all of this in a ghostly image
stuey can you hear me
stueys image still with his mouth taped shut and the chicken pecking at him nods yes
i want you to try and escape
get the cup from underneath the instrument table and bring it to me okay
he gives rick the old trademark coogan thumbs up
rick halfheartedly returns the gesture
stuey checks to make sure nobodys watching him
he removes the spring from a pocket pen and picks the lock
stuey searches the floor and spots the pepsi cup
hell have to crawl through several pairs of legs to reach it
at ees our plans for your gene machine include everything except shoes that is
ha ha ha
gee id love to see your plans
wed love to show you
to his assistant bill if youd be so kind
bill blazer a slick and dashing ees marketing executive strides confidently up to the podium
stuey has to duck the fast approaching legs
bill steps over him not even noticing hes there
bill takes elijahs freak world graphic off an easel and replaces it with his own
finding no place to deposit elijahs he simply drops it on the floor
elijah looks a little hurt
what does todays businessman want
how about a receptionist with six arms five mouths and a knockout figure
thatd sure speed things up wouldnt it
with a big smile bill reveals an illustration of a multi limb secretary in a sexy dress talking on three different phones taking notes and typing all at once
stuey heads towards the pepsi cup
he brushes against the back of hertzs legs
hertz looks over at elijah beside him who smiles politely
hertz smiles back invitingly
maybe theres a few things we dont know about him
in the factory how bout a worker with twelve busy hands no mouth to talk back and no genitalia or digestive system to distract him from his work
its what we all dream of
the ees guys all nod along
except for the workmen who exchange worried looks
elijahs still not sure what to make of it all
meanwhile stuey has the pepsi cup of sludge in hand and hes crawling under the table towards the door
he brushes up against the back of elijahs legs
elijah looks over to hertz who gives him that smile again
elijah looks away quickly panicky
well with this skuggs based noxon technology its not only possible its just the beginning
of course what happened to our expensive spokesman ricky coogan was an unfortunate coincidence but profits from these new markets could total in the billions
all the executives turn to hertz
he cracks a smile
the executives laugh heartily
stuey glances across the room to the door
he has to make a break for it so he does
hes right out in the open in plain view
still nobody seems to see him
theyre still watching bills presentation
wheres the fun
wheres the spark
wheres the unspeakable evil
bill laughs pleasantly
i was just getting to that
bill launches back into his speech with more intensity than even the best infomercials
meanwhile stuey inches towards the door moving as imperceptibly as possible
well impact every field
creams nosejobs in a bottle
military human death machines that make schwarzenegger look like a pansy
and why stop at consumer products
hell we can design a whole new consumer
a few well placed drops in the water supply and bingo
its a new master race and we own the copyright
an entire planet of freaks owned and operated by us
every part of their bodies comes from an ees supplier every thought they think is ees policy
from now on gentlemen its ees uber alles
ees uber alles
the ees guys clap and shout approval
elijahs impressed too
he leans over to hertz
this guys good
we lured him away from a
stuey is finally out the door
of course now they spot him
stuey is outside the lab
inexplicably actually its just because hes so stupid hes still moving inch by inch
he calls to rick through the tape on his mouth
rick sees the image of stuey inching away from the lab
take the tape off your mouth idiot
they didnt tie your hands
stuey realizes this is true and pulls the tape off his mouth
i got the cup rick
theres no time to waste
are you being followed
but if i dont move they wont see me
two big ees security guys are standing watching stueys odd behavior
they pick him up and carry him away
rick sees this all in his holographic image
what a geek
he turns to the other freaks whove woken up and are gathered around on the floor
rick shakes his head
stuey got caught
theres no way to get the ointment before the show
so thats it then
were all to die
and by your hand no less
it wont be me
its some inhuman monster elijah used me to create
as for me the real me ill always be your friend
before i have to rip your heads off id like to say goodbye to each of you
he turns to worm
ill miss your brains the smell of your pipe and the funny way you always go on talking until everyone wants to strangle you
he pats the worm on the head tenderly and turns to cowboy
cowboy ill miss your good humor your down home wisdom and of course the frothy milkshakes were udderly delicious heh heh
he smiles and playfully tugs cowboys udder
he turns to the bearded lady
well always have paris
bearded lady is kind of confused rick shrugs
nosey i never really liked you
he moves on to frog man
frog man i think death is probably the best thing for you now
frog man nods in agreement
rick rpaches julieernie
i have mixed feelings
he turns to ernie on one hand ill remember you as the best friend a jerk like me ever had and a low down repulsive slimeball
he turns to julie
romantic music swells up
on the other hand i really respect you and more than that i uh well i wish wed had the chance to boink
rick calls out to the assembled group
today i make the proudest boast a man can utter ich bien ein freak
theyre all ready to cheer but theyre confused by his bad german
rick has to explain himself
uh im a freak
they all get it
then they cheer
a huge banner reads new improved beast boy slaughters his only
we can hear the sound of the crowd inside
theres a typically smallish crowd in addition to the ees executives who occupy the front seats
the security goons are strategically situated throughout the tent and two of them sit on either side of stuey in the second row
elijah is onstage
and now the moment youve all been waiting for
ladies and gentlemen meet the lucky young man whos about to be become the monster with the mostest
here he is the beast boy
toad pulls a rope and the curtain opens revealing rick strapped to an operating table
on stage left theres a large cage containing all the other freaks
including the unconscious half naked milk man who rick knocked out in the freak house
the milk man domes to looks around in a panic grabs the bars of the cage and screams rick searches the cheering audience for stuey who waves the pepsi cup
full of glop in the air
rick hears stueys voice echo in his head telepathically
stueys waving cup is blocking the view of a big annoyed biker sitting behind him
elijah quiets the crowd and holds up a beaker of ointment
with this remarkable ointment of my own design i will now turn this half finished ghoul into the ultimate super freak dedicated to evil
elijah puts on some rubber gloves and prepares to glop rick who squints under the spotlight still searching for stuey
he calls out telepathically
where are you
stuey stands up on his seat and waves the cup totally blocking the bikers view
he telepathically replies
here i am rick
would you sit down
the biker grabs the cup and dumps it over stueys head
the good ointment runs down all over stueys body
all eyes turn to stuey who falls down and disappears onto the floor screaming
what the hell
suddenly an eight foot tall monster version of stuey leaps to its feet and snarls down at the biker
the biker pulls a switchblade and jams it into stuey monsters leg the blade crumples on his armor like hide
stuey grins and slam
he drives the biker into the ground like a railroad spike
he leaps onto the stage and stalks elijah
rick and the freaks in the cage cheer stuey monster on
uh oh that kid looks pissed
eye and eye rush the stage uzis firing
the bullets bounce off stueys hide
he doinks them with his big monster fingers and sends them flying through
across the compound and thwopp
into the giant heads eye sockets where they spin around and come to a stop cockeyed
the heads foundation crumbles and it keels over backwards
elijah calls out to toad
stuey monster roars at toad
toad smiles weakly
toad catapults through it follows the path of eye and eye across the compound and crash
lands head first into the neck of the giant head
he gets up with the giant head stuck on his own head making him look like one of those big headed caricatures
he runs blindly across the yard and into
eye and eye zing out of the sockets and toads tongue sticks ten feet out of the giant heads mouth
its the biggest tex avery cartoon take ever
he scoops up some evil ointment
looks like its time to roll out the big gun
any last words
rick considers it
he cant think of anything
he raises the ointment over rick
rick has an idea for a last word
elijah glops rick
his skin starts to smoke
stuey monster stalks elijah onstage
rick is smoking and shaking violently on the table
turns to his ees cronies in the audience
he looks bored
what a waste of twelve bucks
lets get the machine and go
the other executives nod
starts to transform
his ears spring out into huge monster ears kinda like in pinocchio
his mouth grows into a massive big daddy roth style monster mouth
his upper head does the same
his body follows suit
he bursts out of the straps and grows into a drooling ten foot tall rick monster
he snarls at stuey monster
the crowd and the other freaks look on tense
stuey monster instinctively whips out a ricky coogan publicity photo and a pen
could you sign this
rick monster snarls and bashes stuey monster in the face
stuey monster jams the pen through the photo and snarls back
even julie is screaming fight
fight beside herself with bloodthirsty glee
ernie smacks her
the crowd goes nuts as the monsters trade a series of cliche pro wrestling moves
stuey bashes rick
rick bashes stuey etc
give him the skull cracker ya big goon
the skull cracker is an illegal move
stuey grabs ricks hair and marches him around the stage
the crowd is taking sides screaming out advice and foaming at their mouths
lets get this over with
hey hertz tell your goons to he turns to hertz and is what the hell
stands in front of the a group of ees hardhats who are using forklifts to move the tasty freekz machine towards the exit
he notices elijah and taps his executive assistant
at this point in time we at ees regret that we must leave this performance prematurely
what are you saying
what were saying is
get stuffed yokel
i figured i couldnt trust you corporate greaseballs
elijah turns to an alarm box on the wall which reads break glass in case of doublecrossing corporate greaseballs
he breaks the glass and pulls the lever inside
a trapdoor on the stage opens and a large chemical tank rises out of it
elijah jumps into the seat of the gun turret nozzle atop the tank
he aims the nozzle at the ees group
let me proudly introduce the latest in our product line noxon now available in a convenient pump
the everything except shoes corporation releases no new products unless i give the order
i think its time ees branched out a little
he presses the plunger and the nozzle spews a torrent of yellow glop on the ees people
they scream in agony as their bodies melt together into one big mutating blob
alistair cooke stands up in the audience hes got a head bandage and a crutch from being trampled at the last show
head for the hills before he gets all of us
the crowd goes berserk and rushes the exits trampling poor cooke like a roach
flips stuey onto the ground and starts stomping on him
stuey is knocked out cold
rick leaves him on the floor and stalks the freak cage murderously
were your friends
now i rip friends to pieces
he rips some bars off the cage and is about to spear julieernie with a jagged steel bar when stuey monster grabs his leg and trips him
stuey summons all his remaining energy to wrestle rick delaying him for the moment from slaughtering the freaks
meanwhile elijah is watching as
a giant shoe made of living flesh
its got eyeballs where the eyes should be a tongue where the tongue should be but its helpless and immobile
elijah looks at it with pride
he does his best ed sullivan now thats a really really big shoe
ha ha ha ha
hmmm i think id like a pair of those
he swivels the nozzle turret towards the cage full of freaks and is about to glop them when rick stands up above stuey blocking elijahs trajectory at the freak cage
rick raises the jagged bar above stuey ready to drive it down through his chest
to rick monster would you hurry up and waste the troll please
i got a lonely shoe over here
rick monster nods and drives the spear down when we
ricks silhouette which matches his ten foot monster incarnation is immersed in the story
sorry to interrupt rick but youve been talking for almost ninety minutes and weve just got to go to a commercial
well be right back after this folks
a fine array of different kinds of cheese on a chopping block
you like cheese
you like being a man
thats why you like
a burly hand swipes all the cheese off the block and slams down an aluminum can labeled macheesmo
real cheese for real men
now in a handy aluminum dispenser
the hand crushes the can and gooey yellow cheese squirts out the top
we hear a music bite from le freak
and now back to the exciting conclusion of ricky coogans incredible story
well lets see the other freaks were lined up in elijahs sights and i was about to shove a pipe through stueys skull when all of a sudden i heard
rick stops the spear inches from stueys chest
their eyes meet
elijahs bloodthirsty goading fades away and cowboys voice reverberates in ricks head
i reckon that troll could help you if you just let him into your heart
the voice keeps echoing
a tear wells up in rick monsters eye
he looks over at cowboy who is actually calling out to him from the cage
rick monster loses his murderous glare
he breaks into a warm smile throws the pipe away and helps stuey monster up
the rest of the freaks cheer wildly
atta boy coog
hey aint that somethin
the worm is gushing sentimentally
he tries to hide his tears
sniff sentimental claptrap sniff shameless maudlin baaa
he cant hold it in anymore
he bawls like a baby
meanwhile elijah is hopping mad
cut the lovey dovey bullshit and start mutilating each other
he aims at rick monster and presses the fire button
the glop starts to flow but before it can make it out of the tip rick grabs hold of the nozzle and twists it around to face elijah
elijah manages to duck just in time
a stream of yellow noxon glop flies over his shoulder and lands in the dunk tank full of carbolic acid that sits off to one side of the tent
the acid and the noxon mix together and bubble up menacingly
elijah hops down out of the gunners chair and squares off against rick monster
meanwhile stuey monster has released the other freaks from the cage
they watch the confrontation from a distance
elijah rolls up his sleeves
rick growls and advances slowly
you think i made you strong
ive cranked my dna up so high you wont know what hit you
im a wrecking machine
he rushes at rick and delivers a flurry of punches to his mid section
they have absolutely no effect
rick brings one heavy fist slamming down on elijahs head stopping him cold
i think you crushed my spinal cord
i cant feel anything in my fingers
maybe youll feel this
rick rears back to kick him
qait if you kill me youll never find the antidote
the freaks all perk up
a time release serum i baked it into a delicious batch of macaroons
a slow smile grows on the freaks faces especially ricks
if you ask me you skimped on the coconut
rick boots elijah between the legs sending him flying through the air
he lands on the dunk tank seat over the bubbling noxon acid
dazed he looks at the bullseye target and back at rick
summoning up his last ounce of bravado elijah makes a last stand
come on coogan
you havent got the guts to kill me
i dare ya
rick ponders for a second
he looks over to julie
scrappy the dog rushes in
he leaps up and presses the bullseye dropping elijah into the hideous mixture
elijah struggles in agony
his body bubbles and mutates in the thick toxic soup
he sinks lower and lower into the gunk until he and his cries are buried for good
scrappy leaps into ricks arms and licks his face
atta boy scrap
the tent flaps fly open and a half dozen fbi agents rush in with guns drawn
another fbi guy investigates the dunk tank sees elijahs hat floating on top of the bubbling ooze
looks like they took care of skuggs chief
the chief nods
they put away their guns and approach rick and the rest of the jubilant freaks
nice work ricky
youll get a medal from the vice president for this
but how did you
weve been following skuggs for years
scrappy just filled in some of the details
thank heavens you brought him to justice rick
god only knows how far his sick plans wouldve gone
hey chief look at this
the fbi guy has peeled the decal off the pepsi machine revealing that its actually a coke machine
the chief is sickened to the core
is nothing sacred
suddenly the agents are distracted by a terrible scream
they turn to the dunk tank and are shocked by what they see
oh my lord
it cant be
we swish pan over to reveal a dripping blob climbing out of the dunk tank
the blob separates into two distinct entities with their backs to us
they turn around and
my god its
or at least a damn fine mutant imitation of them
call him them elijus and elly lee
they both have glowing red demon eyes and speak in elijahs voice
thought you killed me huh
what the hell are you looking at
two pieces of deadmeat
the fbi guys open fire
we show only the horrified reactions of the freaks as they look on
rick regis and kathie lee are still in silhouette
and thats my story
it was so exciting
it makes war and peace sound like a warm up act
we got light
well its about time
the lights come on no more silhouettes
ricky looks perfectly normal his old self
his weird silhouette was caused by a potted plant and some strange hanging mobile behind him
how bout it folks
lets hear it for ricky coogan
the audience applauds and hoots wildly
can we bring out the other freaks now
the audience cheers as the rest of the freaks walk out from the wings and stand off to the side waving to the audience
they all look clean cut and happy
they wear t shirts with their former identities printed on them
i was nosey i was cowboy i was the bearded lady etc
except the worm whos still a worm
his t shirt says im still the worm
just because a man doesnt like macaroons
suddenly a squirrel runs across stage followed by juan
he pounces and catches the furry little bugger
damn its about time
happy to see him hey guys
you look great
they all hug
thats just great
what a story
and what an ending
elijah transformed by the goop
and he really looked like
exactly like you two i swear
same faces same outfits except they had these really big hideous feet
he looks down at regis and kathie lees feet theyre big hideous monster feet
suddenly their eyes glow bright red its elijus and elly lee
they speak with elijahs voice
shows over ricky
im gonna drink your blood
elly lee pulls a machete and is about to force it down on ricks throat when
elijus and elly lees eyes go funny
they look at each other spit up some blood wave to the audience one last time and collapse to the floor
julie stands behind them smoking gun in hand
she rushes to rick
its finally over
yes it is
rick and julie turn and see stuey still a ten foot tall monster running towards them
hes carrying a garbage bag dripping blood
i found the real regis and kathie lee
rick and julie look at the bag mortified
no this is just my lunch
rick and julie sigh with relief
stuey pulls out a similar leaking bag and holds it up
matter of fact this is regis and kathie lee
rick and julie nod casually oh
suddenly elijus and elly lee pop up from behind the couch bloodied but still fierce
theyre about to stab rick and julie when
five more shots ring out and they fall dead again
ernie stands off to the side with a smoking gun
oh like that wasnt totally predictable
well now it really is over
sappy end of the movie music wells up
you know this adventure has taught me something
when man starts impinging on the subtle perfection of the earths natural order the only thing hell create is havoc
i learned somethin too
that men and women truly are equals
that the human spirit transcends gender and physical appearance and thus it is immune to the petty degradations men may devise
i believe it was moliere julies had enough
she socks ernie square on the jaw
oh shut up
she turns to rick lets go fuck
rick gives her the thumbs up
they turn to the audience
good night everybody
the audience cheers
the hit single from the soundtrack album kicks in as we
as the credits roll and everybody continues to smile and wave at the cheering audience elijus and elly lee attack again
ernie hands the gun to stuey who shoots them dead
well dead ish
seconds later after some more waving they attack again
this time nosey and the bearded lady stab them to death sort of
a little more waving before elijus and elly lee make another pathetic attempt
they can barely stand
cowboy clubs one with a mic stand
worm head butts the other
a few seconds later elijuss bloodied hand gropes its way over the top of the studio couch
stuey has to prop him up while members of the audience are invited down to punch him in the chops
ernie stands off to the side charging everyone five bucks per blow
as we fade everyones having a go flipping throwing kicking and impaling rag doll replicas of americas favorite morning show hosts
