a cave painting of the dreamworks logo
push past the moon to the sun
the sun dissolves cave paintings of a family of cavemen we will come to know them as the croods
with every sun comes a new day
a new beginning
a hope that things will be better today than they were yesterday
the croods scurry out of their cave like mice looking for food
the croods are chased by beasts across the desert
they escape from creatures up trees
they hide behind rocks
but not for me
my names eep
this is my family the croods
if you werent clued in already by the animal skins and sloping foreheads were cavemen
most days we spend in our cave in the dark
night after night day after day
home sweet home
when we did go out we struggled to find food in a harsh and hostile world
and i struggled to survive my family
the croods are chased by beasts across the desert
they escape from creatures up trees
they hide behind rocks
we were the last ones around
there used to be neighbors
the gorts smashed by a mammoth
the horks swallowed by a sand snake
the erfs mosquito bite
throgs common cold
and the croods
the croods made it
grug protects his family from a giant bear owl
because of my dad
he was strong
and he followed the rules
a shadow falls across their feet and grug ushers his family home
the ones painted on the cave walls
anything new is bad curiosity is bad going out at night is bad
basically anything fun is bad
welcome to my world
they all run back into the cave where grug slams the rock door closed
slowly light on cave paintings comes up again
but this time the light casts an ominous tone
but this is a story about how all that changed in an instant
because what we didnt know was that our world was about to come to an end
and there were no rules on our cave walls to prepare us for that
caveman hands press against the rock wall
a blinding light floods the screen
a huge caveman grug rushes forward screaming growling and throwing handfuls of dirt in a threat display
he blinks in the bright morning light
he lifts and hurls a large boulder
raaaaar groooooooooooowwwll erf erf glaaaaaabbbbllllllllthhhh
as suddenly as he began grug stops
panting he waits for the echoes of his outburst to fade
grug turns to the cave entrance he prepares to bellow a signal but before any sound escapes his lips a cave girl eep bursts from the cave
youre supposed to wait for my signal eep
eep scares a pack of nearby liyotes away
they pounce on grug briefly before scampering off
eep spreads out on an overhanging rock
she basks in the sun
weve been in that cave forever
three days is not forever
it is with this family
eep would you come down here
youre being so dramatic
a little girl sandy charges out next
her display is more terrier like
no no no sandy come back here
remember the signal
good girls wait for the signal
a cave woman ugga scrambles out next
she is mostly focused on catching sandy giving only cursory effort to her display
as soon as i get sandy ill go back in and you can give the signal
no i mean youre already out now
i am waiting for the signal dad
we hear the voice of grugs nine year old son from inside the cave
thunk is eager to please his dad and emulates his every move
never mind thunk
just come out
not so fast uhh but if you dont give the signal how do i know youre my dad
the signal isnt so you know its me its so you know i wasnt eaten by an animal
then why is the signal an animal noise
i mean doesnt that just confuse things
i dont know
im still waiting for the signal
thunk comes out growling and barrels into grug
thunk picks up a boulder and throws it
it ricochets off the cliff wall and careens into grug
grug gets plowed over by the boulder
mom were ready to leave
grug sits up and smiles
grugs face drops
its still early
and youre still fat
the croods form up in a flying wedge with grug in the lead
i want to see some real caveman action out there
we do this fast
we do this loud we do this as a family and never not be afraid
compressed time the croods run out of crood canyon across the wide expanses of desert
grug and the croods come to a stop at the hunting grounds
they are spent from a fifteen mile run
we see a nest with a huge unguarded blue egg
the croods take shelter behind a rock
grug peers over the top
eeps hand shoots up
thunk is less than enthusiastic
well flip for it
grug lifts gran on his hand and flips her up in the air
call her in the air
gran face plants her head buried in the sand
only her tail is showing
the family fades back and splits up
they get into fighting running position
come on thunk
thunk breaks cover
he dashes into the open snatches the egg
way to go
take it to the cave
thunk passes grug and makes a bee line for crood canyon
a gerf bird smashes thunk and steals the egg back
release the baby
eep and sandy move in on the bird
sandy nips at its heels while ugga climbs up onto its head
she pulls the egg from its beak
down range trip gerbils surface
they stretch their shared tail across the ramus path like an arresting cable on a carrier
ugga rises to throw the egg to grug the gerbils wrap their tail around the ramu like a bola
the ramu goes down hard
ugga and the egg roll forward
the trip gerbils snatch up the egg and make off with it
get um mom
do it for the croods
grans cane hooks the gerbils in the middle of their tail and whips them up and over her shoulder
dribbling the egg down range with her cane like a hockey player
liyotes pop up from behind hoodoos
they swarm in behind her
the liyotes trip gran
they steal the egg and hit the gas
they are incredibly fast
old lady down
eep avenge me
crouched in the shade of a scrubby bush like a runner on the blocks she has the liyotes in her sights
eep eep runs after the liyote with the egg cutting him off in his tracks he slams into a cactus launching the egg into the air
eep leaps into the air taking back the egg
a bunch of jackrobats see eep and swarm around her
she loses her footing and throws the egg to grug
grug catches the egg and runs by the entrance of a small cave
thunk following close behind accidentally trips over the tail of a sleeping bear owl knocking grug to the ground and fumbling the egg once again
thunk catches the egg just as the girelephant bears down on him from behind and lifts him onto one of its tusks
the family members meet up as they begin their long run back to the cave
an entire swarm of animals chase the croods as they head back to their cave
the bear owl is awakened and goes after everyone on the chase
grug protecting his family from the bearowl tosses each family member onto the girelephants back
grug dodges the bearowls attack and uses him as a launching pad to get himself safely on the girelephant
thunk is happy to see dad is safe
oh hey dad can we eat now
just wait till we get home
eep put on the brakes
the entrance to crood canyon appears on the horizon
eep hangs off the edge of one of its tusks as grug takes over the other
together they dig their heels into the ground slowing down the girelephant
the bearowl continues the chase
the croods maneuver the girelephant to fend off the bearowl
the girelephant moving way too fast readies for the crash
the girelephant crashes into the entrance of the canyon sending the croods flying in
they all tumble
grug makes an extraordinary football catch
he holds tight to the meal as he slams into a rock
grug holds up the egg
good one dad
here you go thunk
grug tosses the egg to thunk thunk fumbles it and it cracks open
looks like fast food tonight
the family passes the leaky egg around quickly each crood gets a taste
thunk is the last crood to get a mouthful he hands it over to grug the egg is empty
i ate last week
a shadow touches grugs feet
he looks up the sun is setting behind the canyon wall
he holds up his hand to gauge how much daylight is left
two knuckle warning
come on croods
go go go
come on come on
darkness brings death
we know this
the croods run inside the cave
ugga picks up a heavy stick off the floor
the moon is full
grumbling gran tries to run you too mom
run for your life
ugga pulls gran back
i dont want to lose my protective layer
mom youve got ants
hanging sandy up whack
like shes cleaning a rug ugga smacks sandy hard with the stick
dust and bugs fly off of her
sandy doesnt fuss
ugga claps her hands together and sandy knows to let go
she hits the floor and scampers away
grug enters and looks around the cave
is she still out there
you know she hates the cave grug
on eep clinging to the side of the sheer rock face above crood cave
she raises her hand to catch a few more moments of sun
please come back tomorrow
on grug getting his bath
how can she not like the cave
its so cozy
it is a little dark grug
its not that dark
grug is finished with his bath
eep begins to climb down the wall outside when she hears a sound in the distance
curious she begins to climb even higher
grug leaves the cave searching for her
come on i gotta close the cave
on grug exiting the cave
grug sees that eep is at the very top
eep continues to climb
behind grug the bear owl appears up the canyon
it spots grug and the open cave and races to attack
grug sees the bearowl in full attack mode
grug throws a rock which momentarily stuns the creature allowing eep to jump down and dart into the cave
grug barely gets the cave closed in time
the bear owl pushes his paw through the narrow opening and feels around for the croods
the croods are like mice in this world
that was too close
i was watching
i was fine
what were you doing up there eep
i dont know
what were you looking for
well then why did you go up there
i dont know
why dont you know
stop looking for things
fear keeps us alive eep
never not be afraid
eep climbs up on a ledge and curls up in the corner where a tiny spot of light seeps in
whats the point of all this
what was that
a little louder i mean why are we here
what are we doing this for
no one said survival was fun
nothing is fun
would you come down here
grug climbs up
ugga pulls grug back down
grug climbs back up
i just dont see why she needs her own ledge
thats what this is about
shes working through some things and needs her own space
how long is this going to take
i mean she already doesnt listen to me
a pebble hits grug in the head
it came from eeps ledge
if she wants to survive she has to follow our rules
how about a story
eep loves those
thats a good idea
how about a story huh
oh yeah tell us a story
the croods minus eep gather in a semi circle on the ground
grug retrieves sandy and her krispy bear from the bone crib
can i borrow that
your old favorite
i havent played with that thing in years
tonight well hear the story of krispy bear
grug sits and waits a beat for eep to join but she stays put
as grug talks he gestures at a rough sketch on the wall of the cave
a long time ago this little bear was alive
she was alive because she listened to her father and lived her life in routine and darkness and terror
so she was happy
but krispy had one terrible problem
she was filled with
ugga covers sandys ears
and one day while she was in a tree the curious little bear wanted to climb to the top
and no sooner than she climbed to the top she saw something new and died
grug swats the painting
just like that
her last moments of terror still frozen on her face
grug holds out krispy bear
the family is terrified
oh same ending as everyday
i get it dad
i get it
i will never do anything new or different
good man thunk
pan across the walls to reveal they are covered with stories all seemingly with the same ending
alright everyone sharpen your teeth and lets pile up
all their worst fears confirmed the croods snuggle into one big heap warm and comfy
grug casts a glance to eeps ledge
she doesnt budge
the croods sleep peacefully in their pile
except eep who tosses restlessly on her ledge
outside we hear the roars and howls of prehistoric creatures fighting
but then silence
and then cutting through the primordial night is a musical sound
eep creeps around her sleeping family and cautiously approaches the door to peer outside when suddenly whoosh
a bright light blazes through the gaps around the boulder door bathing eep in an other worldly glow
she chases the flash of light around the cave trying to catch it in her hands
eep presses her face against the cold boulder trying to get a look at what is outside but she cant get more than a blurred glimpse of the canyon beyond
and the disappearing light
desperate to see more eep braces her back against the cave and pushes the plug rock with her legs
slowly she shifts the rock careful not to wake her father
it takes all of her strength but she manages to move it just enough for her to barely squeeze out
eep stands outside at night for the first time ever
her heart races
the hot night wind blows against her face and through her hair
the forbidden sensation is exhilarating
the canyon beyond is quickly swallowing the light it will be gone in another few seconds
with one of her hands pressed tightly to the cave door she steels herself
eep lets go and dashes after the light scrambling through the sandstone narrows bounding from side to side
as she disappears into the darkness of the canyon we
the light ahead is growing brighter
eep is closing on it
in her excitement she missteps and snaps a stick underfoot
it was barely audible
eep instinctively freezes
a huge shadow of a tusked creature is cast on the wall above her
eep throws a rock at the shadow
she powers straight up the stone wall with unexpected speed
the creature runs
eep tops the wall and
eep steps into a small clearing
stuck in the ground is a torch
as far as eep knows this is the thing she was following
eep crouches down and cautiously approaches
reverse angle eep can feel the heat from the fire on the palms of her hands and her face
but camouflaged against the rock wall behind her something moves
a warthog creature stands upright and creeps up behind her
eep reaches out to touch the flame
the torch blows away from her
the wind has changed direction
the breeze at her back eep smells the creature behind her
on her face awe turns to determination as she wheels and grabs the creature
she throws and flips it over her shoulder
it hits the torch knocking it to the ground
eep jumps back grabbing a good sized rock shes poised to bash the creatures brains in
the creature defensively raises its arms hands in front of its face
eep gasps shocked to see human hands attached to this monstrosity
the creature slowly puts his hands to the sides of his grotesque head and raises its mask
its a boy
this is guy
eep leaps back a few paces dropping the rock on guys foot
eep moves swiftly to silence him
she pounces on him and twists his head sideways
guy is suffocating
he feels around for a stick and bashes eep in the side of the head
im a person like you
eep tosses the boulder aside and lifts guy with one hand
eep opens guys mouth and pokes around inside
she sniffs at him
turns him upside down
okay could you not hee hee hee that tickles
eep looks closely at belt a sloth wrapped around guys waist
belts eyes open
eep drops guy on his head
eep jams her foot over guys mouth
im not supposed to be out here
guy bites her foot
she kicks guy in the stomach
he rolls sideways
guy is getting the worst of this encounter
eep kicks guy off frame
we hear the fight continuing
grug is awakened by wind coming from the cave opening
he pushes the sleep pile off of him
checks eeps ledge
but she is gone
stay in the cave
grug stands outside the entrance to the cave
peering into utter darkness
he steels himself
and then releases his hand from the door
guy is still on his knees
in pain defeated wow
youre really strong
the flame dwindles
guy moves toward it
eep blocks him
i caught it
no way guy is getting past her
i can fix it
eep doesnt want to
i hate the dark
eep sees a kindred spirit
she gets out of his way
guy picks up the torch and blows
eep scoots closer to guy staying in the circle of light around him
as guy brings the fire back to life the relief on his face is familiar to eep
this boy seems to have power over light itself
eep is smitten
it does what you tell it
well yeah sort of
to the flame hi fire
its not alive
but you said it was dying
uh sorry it comes from where you come from
i make it
eep balls her fist grabbing guy tightly by the hair
make some for me
okay it doesnt come out of me
eep squeezes guy like a tube of toothpaste
you do this a lot
eep drops guy hes broken
are you dead
can i have your fire if youre dead
belt rubs two flat rocks together and places them on guys chest like defibrillator paddles
guy bolts upright
hey those are cold
listening shells activate
belt and guy use shells to listen to the ground
tiger girl we need to leave immediately
he tries to pull her by the arm
she stays put like an anchor
i dont even know you
pained rushed ow
and this is belt
cook conversationalist navigator also keeps my pants up
what are pants up
who are you
cutting her off let me clarify eep
the world is ending
im calling it
da da daaaaa
how do you know
guy and belt both do gestures to accompany the da da daaaa
it seems very important to them
ive seen it
its coming this way
first the earth is going to shake
then it breaks open
everything falls in
i dont mean to sound too dramatic but aaaaaaaugh
believe me everything were standing on all this right here will be gone
again with the gestures
its a little weird to eep
weve got to get to high ground
i know a mountain that way he points into the distance
its our only chance
extending his hand come with me
guy and belt reach out their hands to eep
guy hands the shell to eep
and eep is mesmerized
guy pulls his hog mask back down
if you survive call me
eep test blows the shell
it makes a sound she giggles
when she looks up to thank guy he is gone
eep bumps directly into grug
are you hurt
what took you
i left on my own
dad let me explain
a low growl interrupts them
on the bear owl sniffing around
it passes over a log
crane down to reveal grug hanging under the log by one hand eep dangling in the other
you never let me talk
grug and eep move up the canyon
eep furiously kicks a rock it nearly hits grug
things are tense between the two
at the keyhole they are met by the rest of the croods
you know what i am so mad right now that i cant talk to her
youll never believe it
i found something new
the croods all snatch up stones
they form a defensive circle
news a big problem
eep is trapped in the middle of the defensive formation
she squeezes out
stay inside the family kill circle
it wasnt bad
new is always bad
he was nice
well i thought he was a warthog but then he turned into a boy
usually its the reverse
grug raises an eyebrow
eeps got a boy hog
eeps got a boy hog
eep elbows thunk in the back of his head
there was a boy
im gonna call him
eep pulls out the shell
she blows into the shell the sound alarms the croods
they smack the shell from eeps hand and smash it with their rocks
eep is incredulous
the dust clears the panting croods are satisfied the object is gone
what is wrong with you
it was dangerous
it was beautiful
you want to see dangerous
she pelts thunk with a rock
okay eep thats it
were going back to the cave and youre going to stay in there until youre older than
you cant keep me inside forever
eep throws a tantrum of epic proportion
she slams a rock on the ground
it shatters to dust
a strange groan is heard from under the ground
then a small amount of sand falls from up above
a crack starts to splinter under their feet
he said this would happen
the ground starts to shake
get to the cave
the croods race through the canyon narrows fighting their way through falling boulders and shifting ground heading towards the safety of their cave
the croods see the cave entrance
the canyon walls above their home start to crack
grug sees that the falling rock will crush the cave
grug leaps and tackles his family protecting them from the mass of rocks crashing down
the top of the canyon collapses and the croods cave is destroyed
everything is engulfed by dust
the earth settles
the dust clears a bit the croods are in a tight ball covered by grug
grug stands all croods were sheltered and safe under his mighty arms
is everyone okay
grug the cave its gone
grug looks back to crood cave
it is gone
grug searches the rubble for any sign that the cave might still be there
he finds one handprint split in two
he carefully fits them back together
emotional he lowers his head
as eep steps forward a shaft of light filtering through the dusty veil from the wreckage crosses her face as the dust descends eep sees a new world beyond
you really need to see this
the dumbfounded croods stare in awe at the beautiful world
the croods look out at the new world
we should go there
no one is going anywhere
grug pulls eep back from the precipice
what else did that boy say
suddenly bursting from the new world is a giant flying creature a turtle dove
the croods reel back as it sails overhead
they turn to watch the turtle dove as it flies away
they hear a familiar menacing growl
its the bear owl
it roars and charges toward the croods
grug instinctively grabs a giant boulder and rolls it in front of his family
the bear owl runs and swats the massive boulder away like a ball of yarn
but the croods are not behind it
they are running towards the new world
the croods run towards the precipice with the bear owl closing in
they reach the edge
the bear owl dives
the croods leap
they hang for a moment and begin tumbling down a steep jungle hill
the croods tumble through a twisty mess of giant roots and strange plants and land in a heap
they all lie on their backs disoriented but momentarily calm
grug sits up first
he turns to the high high cliff above them to the top where they have lived all their lives up to this moment
a few loose pebbles continue to tumble down
there is no sign of the bear owl
the others stand up and they take in this new place
grug takes a deep breath and then quickly counts one two three four five beat
gran lands in a heap behind him
winces in pain oh
where are we
i dont know im not sure
in a lower place
one things for sure we cant go back the way we came
the croods sit up
they are disoriented
sniff sniff sniff grrrrrrrrrrr
hushed urgent sandy
what is it
sandy lunges at something almost disappearing into a bush
grug barely catches sandy by her leg
grug pulls her back like a dog on a leash
come back sandy
sandy has a mousephant in her mouth
grug knocks it from sandys mouth
a gaggle of mousephants run out from the bush and scurry away
we cant be out in the open like this
we need a cave
now step where i step
they start moving
hopefully nothing big knows were here yet
pull back a huge colorful predator the macawnivore senses something
he sits up and stalks off
on the croods moving fitfully through the strange forest
the croods cautiously move in fits and stops through the middle of this thick pre historic rainforest
so dad just to be clear are we looking for the exact same cave
if it was me im just throwing this out there if it was me choosing the cave i would go with a smaller cave
as they trek strange creatures bear pears punch monkeys watch these foreigners
in the front of the line grug is freaked out
but in the back eep is taking in the wonders
they pass through a curtain of hefty hanging pears
after they pass the pears all turn to watch the croods
a leaf flutters down
eep and grug look up
ill take care of this
grug launches into his threat display wwaaaaaaarrgghhaarrraaaarrgghhh
he flails his arms around and jumps about in front of the nearest punch monkey
no reaction from the punch monkey
grug stops confused
the punch monkey now breaks into a broad grin
then hauls off and thud punches grug in the face
grug reels back surprised turns
right into another punch monkey
it winds up and thud
it hits grug grug reels back into another monkey thud
alright dad go get em
oh oh now you got em now theyre really hitting you
dad i got it just stop running into their fists
gran joins in and punches grug in the nose
hah im loving this
grug when youre done we should get going
wide shot grug is being bounced back and forth like a pinball from one punch monkey to the next
the punch monkeys are whooping and hollering this is great fun
the punch monkeys let go of grug and begin running away for no apparent reason
grug staggers backwards into the family
you cant get past this
a colorful bush rears up its not a bush its a macawnivore
the croods react terrified grug throws a rock at it
the macawnivore catches the rock and springs
grug pushes and forces the croods up a huge tree then as it steps away it is actually a giant animal
grugs pov a cave
the croods jump off the bird leg in hopes of getting to the cave
hurry up lets go
the croods all run like crazy in the direction grug pointed
they step inside the cave
the front of the cave comes down
the croods have jumped inside the mouth of a land whale
this cave has a tongue
the land whale stands up and then spits the croods out through its blow hole
the croods land in a heap
okay thats one two three four five
if were counting chunky the death cat
the macawnivore appears from behind some nearby grass
it looks at the croods with delight
suddenly the shadow of the setting sky passes over the macawnivore
it freaks out and retreats into the forest
its scared of the dark
were scared of the dark
and for good reason because as the shadow from the setting sun falls across the croods
suddenly thousands of piranha owls burst from the grasses around the croods and form a huge undulating cloud above them
its a beautiful sight
the cloud of piranha owls then settle on a massive land moments later they fly back into the air the whale is skeletonized
it crumples to the ground
the croods form their defensive circle brandishing rocks
eep spies a skull lying in the sand
she sprints for it
eep breaks a horn from the skull and blows on it loud and long
on guy hearing the horn
he is happy to hear the sound knowing its eep calling him
then as guy begins walking towards the sound guy notices the circling birds in the sky
alarmed he dashes off
guy appears at the treeline
he spots eep standing alone in the clearing
he sees the birds heading towards her
he runs and leaps off a rock outcropping jumping right over the croods who are huddled near the rock
guy lands and in one fluid motion knocking the horn out of eeps hand to stop the noise then strikes a spark with two stones
the birds close in blotting out the remaining light
all goes black
then a tiny leaf of flame flutters to life before guy
he throws two more handfuls of grass on it and it flares up
the light splits the onrushing red tide of birds like a knife
for a few moments the croods are inside a tornado of the tiny monsters
the mass passes
grug slaps at one last smoldering bird fluttering past
grug turns to see guy holding his daughter
grugs expression darkens
grug pushes eep aside and shows guy his threat display
suddenly guy and eep are circled by the croods
they are in defensive ape like positions
each doing their threat display
raaarr groooooooowwllll glaaabbbllllellelller
guy stands in front of eep defensively
theyre practically animals
see their bony sloping foreheads
the huge primitive teeth
the excessive body hair
oh that ones got a tail
guy pulls his knife
close your eyes
im going to have to take their lives
slapping the knife away no
it wont help
theyre my family
eep nods toward thunk
ah the sun is in his hands
the croods keep circling
where did it come from
he made it
grug grabs him and squeezes him tight
make some for me
it doesnt come out of him
guys ribs are cracked for the second time
you know youre a lot like your daughter
guy falls in a heap
great now hes broken
oh its a baby sun
grug turns to see ugga thunk gran and sandy are now sitting very close around the fire transfixed
we dont know what it wants
as grug moves around the circle picking up sitting croods and placing them a safe distance from the fire he talks to them like a kindergarten teacher now well all
sit here and wait for the sun to come back
and tomorrow well find a new cave and pretend today never happened
looks at the fire isnt this fun eep
grug looks around to see that eep is kneeling beside guy
eep dont touch him
goodness knows where hes been
suddenly behind grug sandy attacks the torch
she shakes it with her teeth embers fly everywhere
dad sandys hurting fire
grug reaches down and scoops up sandy
note from this point grug will hold onto sandy no matter how much she struggles kicks and bites
fire is not a play thing
aww what a cute little guy
hey stay back
the croods snatch at the embers as they dance in the air around them
no no no wait
one of the embers has caught onto thunks tunic
it likes me
after a beat hey
its biting me
thunk takes off running like a maniac
the flame explodes into embers which starts more fires in the grass around him
grug looks at the growing fires with utter confusion
youre not my friend
stop stop touching me
uh try hiding from it in the tall dry grass
thunk sprints through the grass arms flailing as a ring of fire blazes up
pleading with fire stop please please
im only nine
gran cackles at her grandsons misfortune but then she realizes her walking stick is on fire
angrily gran starts to slam the burning end of the stick on the ground trying to put it out
but she only ends up making more small fires
ooh more fire babies
while gran tries desperately to save her cane ugga starts throwing sticks on the small fires which begin to grow in size
so your dad hes trying to kill me
but i wont let him
eep and guy witness the fiery mayhem hold on son come back
grug is chasing thunk in circles throwing rocks at his flaming butt
i dont like you anymore
sandy who is still in grugs arms but facing backwards is now holding onto a burning stick and lighting everything she passes on fire
gran who is still trying to put out her stick is batting it into every tree and bush she can hit
ugga carries a redwood above her head and then tosses it onto the small fire
eat up babies
ugga ignites a massive bonfire
the croods appear like a bunch of violent lunatic pyromaniacs
gran is pounding her walking stick on the ground
pull back to reveal she is standing on the edge of a giant corn field that is slowly catching on fire
the fire on her cane has finally gone out
and then wa pop
the giant ear of corn explodes blasting gran off frame who slams into thunk
the speeding ear picks up ugga grug
theyre not so scary once you get to know them
eep and guy are hit by the speeding corn
who are you people
oh im sorry
were the croooooods
and you are
the speeding ear crashes into a lone tree sending guy and the croods sprawling across the tundra
the flying ears rocket skyward and burst like colorful fireworks
looks like magic
and smells like food
popcorn kernels rain down upon the croods
they are dont eat it its new
the croods burst out of a mountain of popcorn
come on keep eating
guy burrows out the side of the popcorn pile like a prisoner escaping alcatraz
gasping for air checks to see if hes been
hey wheres guy
guy runs for the mountain
eep pounces on guy like a tiger
end of the world remember
that already happened
it destroyed our cave
that was just the beginning of the end
the end of the end is still coming
as if to a dog eep
eep sets him down
guy bolts but discovers eep hasnt let go of his hand
guy is yanked backwards like hes been tied to a piling
we cant let him go
what if we dont find a cave before sunset
what if it takes a few days
what if the birds come back
we need his fire dummy
grug grabs guy and throws him in a log
youre staying with us till we find a cave
grug hoists guy in the log onto his shoulder
grug moves out away from the mountain
the family falls in behind grug
thunk is carrying a huge piece of popcorn that hes snacking on
no im not
dont make me part of this
stay here if you want but let me go
ive got a dream a mission a reason to live
ive got an idea
lets go to that mountain
on the tall mountain way in the distance
its too far
dad really has his heart set on a cave
uh there are caves on that mountain
have you been there
its a mountain
mountains are safe
mountains have caves
did you hear that
i can get my own stick
caves and sticks
on cue a rumble
this gets grugs attention
the croods wait to see whats going to happen next
a mammoth falls out of sight swallowed by the ground
da da daaaaa
sandy tries to attack belt
that thing is weird
belt antagonizes sandy by sticking his tongue out at her
sandy goes at belt again
no no its okay sandy
thats just a belt
grug takes a step back
ive made a decision
were going to that mountain
dont ask me why
its just a hunch
it just feels right
i dont know grug
weve never really walked that far
i dont think my feet can do that
ill never live long enough to get there
lets do it
oh come on just think
our whole family packed together on a long slow trip across country
days and nights with just each other
well tell stories
glancing at eep well become closer as a family
eep raises one eyebrow
the croods have not traveled far
the camera starts tight in on thunk and sandy
sandy is harassing thunk
get her off
if youre not ready to challenge her then dont look her in the eye
we follow sandy as she moves past gran
could you keep your big giant arms on your side of the trail
sandy moves past ugga eep and guy who is still stuck in the log and being carried by grug
no more touching
no more touching
isnt this fun
were taking our first trip together
thunk accidentally bumps into eep
stop shoving or i will pull out your tongue
do you want me to turn this family around
because i will turn this family around so fast
the camera slowly pulls out from the family in chaos as they walk across the burned out landscape
the croods are traveling across the dry land
the camera has pulled out from the family as they travel
family chaos continues
dad i gotta go
come on you can hold it
i dont think so
i gotta go really bad
thunk starts to hop with his knees glued to each other
go behind one of those lumpy things and make it fast
something bit me
i dont blame it
maybe we should have stopped for water
a liyote turns to watch the croods as they travel
dad can i take a turn carrying him
how about now
even louder now
i can do this all day long
no no no and still no
oh yeah more traveling
now we are in the turkeyfish hunting grounds
the camera is so far away the croods are only a speck in the frame
grug exhausted in the foreground with family chaos over his shoulder
im not dying on an empty stomach
grug were all pretty tired
im pretty dizzy so im just going to lay down for a minute
well eat when we get there
its taking too long
im grabbing a snack
gran jumps up and tries to grab belt
belt pulls a bone knife and defends himself
dont do that
he will cut you
thats not food hes a pet
whats a pet
an animal that you dont eat
we call those children
no man should have a pet
its weird and wrong
its spies giant bird its food
no no please
a whooping sound comes from the grasses ahead
a giant turkey fish raises its toothy head
food fixes everything
grug grabs thunk
alright show me your hunting face
eep shows her hunting face
youre still grounded
come on thunk
my feet hurt
leaning against a rock next to gran sandy eep and ugga
guy notices eep is agitated
she stares in the direction the men went
you look tense
im not tense
angry girl wants to be doing what theyre doing
i wasnt ready
thunk crashes through the bushes pursued by the turkey fish
grug is being drug behind
hang on thunk im coming
why are you doing this
what are they doing
get it off
you stay away from me
no seriously what are they doing
the turkeyfish squashes grug into the ground
then continues chasing thunk
to turkey fish youve got a ton of eggs
just make another egg
thunk flies into frame and splats against the rock
the turkey fish climbs to the top of a nearby rock and dives off
now youre just rubbing it in
slapped on a rock in front of the croods
the bronto scorpion suddenly struggles
whos hungry for scorpion
the croods pull at the legs
they twist and snap off like lobster legs
what happened to the egg and the bird
you know we lost him
but when the bird stepped on me and pushed me into the ground the scorpion grabbed a hold of me and one thing led to another and here we are
the dismembered legs continue to struggle
guy looks ill
i need more
i need more
gran looks hungrily at guy
oh look at that
shes not gonna eat me right
youre too skinny
if she was gonna eat anyone it would be owww
shes locked her jaw
sandy gets up from the table
someone get a stick
get her off
guy looks on horrified
oh you sick old monster
put the stick in her mouth
belt gives guy a lets get out of here look
belt rolls guy away from the family
hold her still
use a rock
ugga would you just hit her legs
eep chases him and pins him down
why are you rolling away
i just want something to eat
you have bug for dinner
plenty of bug
ill let you help me hunt
theyre all over me
tell my story
guy lays a snare in the low grass
he walks to the base of a rotund spikey tree unwinding more rope as he goes
he ties the rope around the base of the tree
then he hands the loose end to eep
belt stretches his arms wide
guy stops jumping and points up to the top of the tree
eep takes the cue
she leaps up and grabs the leaning top of the tree
her weight gently bends the tree top down to the ground
guy carefully sets the trigger
what do you call this
what does it do
guy makes sound effects to get his point across as he describes the trap
explains with sounds soft whistle raargh thump thump thump thubububububub soft whistle poom
how long have you been alone
belt opens his arms wide showing guy has been alone a long long time
so what do we do
guy pulls out a weird miniature turkey fish puppet
hows your acting
on the turkey fish getting ready to eat the trip gerbils
the turkey lifts the creature to his mouth to devour it but hes interrupted by a whistling sound
he turns to see the silly little puppet dancing about
the turkey fish drops his meal and cautiously approaches the puppet
on guy and eep working the puppet
eep is having the time of her life
oh youre good at this
they are so into what they are doing they accidentally get tangled up
oh sorry i
just move your arm
no your other arm
oh that ones mine
in their struggle to untangle themselves eep and guy inadvertently insult the turkey fish
eep and guy dont notice
the turkey fish misses the snare leaps the rock and snatches the fake bird off of guys head thrashing it
it didnt step in your trap y thing
yeah i noticed
eep boldly stands in front of the bird
the turkey fish grabs guy and tosses him high across the open field
he goes flying through the air screaming
on grug hearing the commotion
guy lands back in the log
eep is in full parkour as she runs from the turkeyfish
grug steps forward
hes going to spring the trap
she leaps the snare pushing grug down
the turkey fish hits the trigger
the snare trips
the bird bites at the cavemen but comes up short
the turkey fish whooshes backwards into the air
he flies a couple hundred feet up
and crashes down in a cloud of feathers
on the turkey roasting over an open fire
it looks golden and juicy
grug is agitated
the croods are devouring the turkey fish
its an avalanche of flavor
the croods are eating like wild animals
they practically maul each other for scraps
howls and snarling fill the night air
guy is amazed and shocked at how the croods are wolfing it down
guy sits to the side his ankle roped to a heavy rock
guy and belt share a concerned look as they politely eat their meal
eep comes over and sits next to guy
looks like we wont be having any leftovers
what are left overs
you know when you have so much food to eat you have some left over
we never have that much food
grug is struck by eeps words
ugga sees grug is hurt
guy and belt are struck by this as well
grug how about a story
thats a good idea
how about a story huh
yeah a story tell us a story
croods gather around grug
once upon a time there was a little tiger who lived in a cave with her family
there were a lot of rules but the big simple one was to never leave the cave at night
and the door was so heavy youd think it would be easy to remember
so easy to remember
but while everyone was asleep she went out anyway
and no sooner than she did her cave was destroyed and everyone had to go on this long sucky walk with some weirdo they met and died
i did not see that coming
my stories never end like that
two stories in one night
the croods leave grug and gather around guy
guy is uncharacteristically dumbstruck
but it wont be as good as grugs
um once upon a time there was a beautiful tiger
she lived in a cave with the rest of her family
her father and mother told her you may go anywhere you want but never go near the cliff for you could fall
thinking the story is over the croods begin to get up
as guy begins talking again they settle back down
but when no one was looking she would go near the cliff for the closer she came to the edge the more she could hear the more she could see
the more she could feel
finally she stood at the very edge and she saw a light
she leaned out to touch it and slipped
and she fell
and she flew
where did she fly
a place with more suns in the sky than you can count
it would be so bright
a place not like today or yesterday a place where things are better
tomorrow isnt a place you cant see it
oh yes yes it is
ive seen it
thats where im going
grug studies guy
is he crazy
eep though is entranced
eep and guy lock eyes
there is something growing between them
grug and belt see it too
grug is not thrilled
well we are going to shut our eyes and sleep
and when we wake up were going to find the place that has everything we want
grug stuffs guy neatly back inside the log
grug curls up by the fire with the log tucked under his arm far away from eep
snoring tossing and turning
morning light kisses grugs cheeks
hes sound asleep
pull out to reveal that guys log is now teetering over a cliff edge there was another subduction during the night and half of the croods sleeping platform has sunk
two hundred feet
grug is still grasping guys log which now hangs over the fresh abyss and the still asleep guy is now slipping out of one end
in the nick of time grug shifts position inadvertently turns the log and guy starts slipping out the other end
guy wakes up looking down
the croods trudge behind grug as he cautiously makes his way to the mountain
grug sniffs and tests the ground he moves like a man in a mine field
eep walks alongside guy who is still being carried by grug in the log
that was too close
it almost caught us
i was watching
we were fine
weve got to move faster
do you people have any other speed aside from wander
ill take a shamble at this point
hey do you have a minute
how did the tiger fly
i only share when im outside the log
im funny that way
leave this to me
eep falls back behind thunk getting him between she and her dad
hey thunk you have a spider on your face
eep smashes thunk in the face knocking him into grug sending guy and the log flying
grug shoots eep an annoyed look
grug sees guy has rolled away
grug goes to retrieve guy and steps on something sharp
do not step on those weird pointy rocks
you mean these rocks
do not step on these rocks
thunk steps on the coral it crunches under his feet
step aside girls
gran steps out and then screams
no one is listening
you cannot walk on those
guy stands on the coral without flinching
arraughrragh come back here now
well there goes our chance for survival
and our log
grug must make the choice to go after guy
grug cringes and bellows with every step
guy still locked inside the log hops away as fast as he can
grug leaps out and grabs the log only to loosen it as guy jumps to a coral patch below
ow ow ow
guy now free runs and hides behind a giant shell
he looks back at the croods as they try in vain to cross the field and feels pity for eep
jumping doesnt help i mean just briefly but it doesnt get better
do not walk on your hands the hands do not help at all
guy looks back at the stranded croods
then he looks again to the tall mountain
belt sees that guy is having a hard time leaving the croods
he needs to make a choice
belt makes it for him
belt walks guy back to the croods i can help you but were going to have to make a few changes around here
the log ride is over
drop the log
grug grudgingly drops the log
now kick it away
grug barely nudges it
grug kicks it a quarter mile
okay smart guy
everyone is now wearing shoes some made of leaves sponges and some are actually fish
ugga and gran wobble on their new shoes
thunk is covering his eyes too afraid to look down
thunk looks down at his horrifying fish shoes
they blink at him
eep is covering her eyes
now you can look
eep peers down at her new boots
i love them
where are my feet
theyre still there
eep slips and falls into guys arms
youre really heavy
grug walks over as the two fall to the ground
these shoes are great
where do you get these ideas
on cue belt produces a piece of chalk
guy stands thunk against a wall
guy stands next to him
belt outlines them
guy excitedly gestures to the silhouettes
im calling it a brain
im pretty sure its where ideas come from
i dont have a brain
weve gotten along just fine without brains till now
cavemen dont need brains
we have these
balls his mighty fists thats what im talking about
ideas are for weaklings
grug punches at the air in front of guy making him wince
now lets get to that mountain
ugga and eep notice each others shoes
i love those
dont eat my feet
the croods run slowly at first then faster
the shoes make the difference
grug encounters a bunch of punch monkeys again
he readies himself for a fight
guy hands out bananas
grug throws his banana to the ground only to slip on it
grug sees the macawnivore down below in the crevasse waiting for his croods dinner
grug sees guy making something out of sticks
traveling by stilts over a crevasse
the family hobbles across a canyon on their stilts
guy helps eep from falling
howd the tiger fly
he jumped on the sun and rode it to tomorrow
grug doesnt like seeing his daughter so close to guy
no no no
the family moves across grug is the last to follow
grug spies chunky the death cat below him
grug whacks chunky in the face with a stilt
chunky ponders the strange sticks grug is perched on then whacks a chunk out of them
grug drops down by a yard or so
panicking grug races across the chasm losing stilt height with every swipe of chunkys paw
grug doesnt make it across snarling and biting sounds emanate from the canyon
the croods stand at the top of a cliff
grug tries to maneuver his way down the cliff by clinging to the side
guy and the other croods sit on a giant leaves sledding down the side of the canyon past grug
they pass grug up as he continues to make his way down by tiptoeing
grug stumbles and falls down the slope
a flash pops against the croods
swing the camera around to reveal a huge storm hanging like a purple curtain before them
the croods stop dead
the rain line bears down on them
grug tries to punch the drops
youve seen rain before
we dont get out much
guy opens an umbrella to cover himself from the rain
belt pulls eep under the umbrella to be close to guy
belt makes an origami boat
he and sandy sail across the rain puddles
grug seeing guy and eep snuggling under the umbrella grabs the umbrella away from guy
grug gets hit by lightning
the rest of the croods open their umbrellas to take cover as they enjoy the rain
the croods stand on a tiny island in a shallow ocean eep is pointing at her own reflection
eep looks dangerous
oh dad you say that about everything
eep goes to jump in the water
guy stops her
eep tentatively hops in
guy steadies her
then shows her how to move her arms in a swimming motion
guy supports eep by holding one hand under her tummy
she begins to swim
gran and ugga smile mischievously a positive vibe is building
the croods all jump at once
grug is left alone
belt uses grugs arm as a diving platform
gran sandy and belt are doing synchronized swimming
then grug sees eep and guy surface eep is on guys shoulders
this is too much for grug
no no no
grug dives in to put a stop to any potential shenanigans
grugs huge tidal wave swamps guy and eep
grug sinks to the bottom
on grug laying on the bottom
his family swims above him on the tails of fishcats confident and free and buoyant
a lone bubble escapes grugs nose like oil oozing from a sunken wreck
hes feeling mighty extraneous
grug sees the macawnivore swimming towards him
grug swims for his life
ends in a big splash
so the bear says your cave
ive been dumping my bones here since last week
last week haha
thats a funny story
its not a story
its a joke
whats a joke
you know just making something up
to make you laugh
hah i dont get it
the croods stand motionless before an open plain deeply sculpted with meandering grooves which form a massive guy is handing out shells to the croods
here you go one for you and this ones for you
grug is annoyed by everyone blowing their shells
i dont see why the kids need their own shells
so if anyone gets in trouble we can call the others
wait youre saying we should split up
we can try more paths at once
its the fastest way through
croods stick together
your way isnt safe
they can handle it
we can do it dad
no no no no no
its my job to keep you safe
im still in charge and we are not splitting up
seeing eep and guy together except for you two
and thats final
grug sits down like a silverback gorilla
just then a huge rumble
the earth starts to shake violently
the croods and guy are knocked down into the maze each falling into a separate entrance
they disappear into the rift like a penny dropped down a drain
as grug and guy slide passed each other
frustrated grug tries to punch guy
the shaking comes to a stop
everyone now separated gathers themselves
on grug finding himself alone
is everyone alright
trying to calm him were okay grug
im freaking out a little bit
just tell me what to do
just what do i do right now
stay where you are
ill find you
everybody keep moving forward and well get out
looking very frightened
remember never not be afraid
you can do this
its gonna be okay
im gonna pass out
thunk picks up his shell and tentatively makes his way alone into his branch of the maze
on eep or guy
in another part of the maze
she puts her hand on the giant wall to her left
pull back and see that they are actually in parallel channels but with the huge wall between them
on gran and ugga encountering carnivorous flowers
on thunk encountering a croco pup
on eep finding a flower dropped on her path
on grug reaching a fork
ugga and gran don flowery camouflage
thunk throws his shell at the crocopup misses
to his surprise the crocopup returns the shell
thunk plays fetch with this portly beast which shows him the way through the maze
eep picks up the flower puts it in her hair then finds a more flowers dropped on her path
she playfully begins hunting for guy
guy and belt are secretly and playfully tossing flowers in eeps path
grug pops out of a passageway hes back where he began
he chooses another tunnel
ugga and gran pass unharmed through the flower grove the colors and smells are overpoweringly vibrant
eep surprises guy and belt in their hideaway as the two of them continue to throw flowers over the edge and onto eeps path
you dropped these
guy slips and falls onto a huge lilypad
he smiles up at eep
they share a moment before eep shyly vanishes again
grug finds himself back at the entrance of the maze
he grumbles and enters a different tunnel
guy appears at the exit and puts his hand up to the setting sun that kisses the top of the mountain
guy is amazed that he and eep are both doing the same thing
he is smitten
guy goes over to eep
guy takes her hand
come with me
eep and guy turn to each other just as thunk emerges and tosses a rock for the croco pup to fetch
here boy catch
a shell note signals ugga gran and sandys arrival
there is an obvious change in the ladies
ugga removes her hat to reveal her new look
a loud shell blast interrupts
it is followed by two others
grug lets out another blow on his horn
ill go get him
on grug still stuck in the maze
he holds his head in defeat and tosses the shell down
truck in on grug
pan up a giant redwood tree
the croods are gathered in a cozy crook of the tree
belt mixes drinks while gran relaxes in a hammock
thunk is playing with his new pet
whose my good boy
you need a name you want a name
im going to call you douglas
look at him
can you do tricks
come on douglas roll over
douglas rolls over right off the tree
good boy douglas
belt pours a drink for gran
sandy takes gran her drink as she spins over to her on her starfish shoes
i was in love once
he was a hunter i was a gatherer
it was quite a scandal
we fed each other berries
then my father smashed him with a rock and traded me to your grandfather
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
ha ha ha ha
ugga and grug approach
they hear the laughing coming from high above
grug peers up and sees the swinging hammocks torch lights
come get down here
grug theyre okay
guys with them
oh oh guy
guy is with them
well thank you for bringing me that interesting guy update
a beat ugga regards her husband oh okay
im gonna go up and why dont you join us when you stop being a big drag
ugga climbs up the tree to be with the rest of the family
grug isnt thrilled with uggas shot at him
he picks up two rocks and tries to make fire
how about a story huh
grug listens intently
all he hears is laughter
thunk sandy belt and gran are sitting around a torch listening to one of grans stories
and then torg said know it
i drew it
ha ha ha ha ha ha
that makes no sense
ugga arrives and sits next to guy
she takes in the scene
i know it was hard for you to bring us along but they had the best day of their lives
thank you for that
a rumble distracts guy
he looks to the horizon
fires and smoke on the horizon mark the leading edge of the collapse
eep comes to his side
i want to show you something
guy lights a torch and leads the croods up up to the forest canopy
guy blows out his torch
the night sky is revealed in all its glory
the croods are amazed
music pounds as the spectacle sweeps around the croods
perched on the canopy of the forest the croods seem to sit at the very brink of the universe
more suns in the sky than you can count
every sun that crosses our sky comes to rest up there
thats where well be safe
on grug arriving at the tree top
when he sees the stars he ducks back down terrified
he overhears the rest of the conversation
eep with tears in her eyes
im going with guy
grug is beside himself with panic sick at the thought of losing eep
not my little girl
come with us
i cant go without grug
well that makes one of us
count me in
grug continues to listen in
grug has no idea how to protect us
in fact he has no ideas at all
no thats not true
what about that one time when he a
if he actually had an idea of his own id id have a heart attack and die
grug smiles to himself
the whole family is searching for grug
he has disappeared
hes a big guy
how can he just disappear like that
lets ask that ugly lady if shes seen dad
grug spins around
hes wearing a rasta style wig made from knotted grass
the sight shocks ugga
havent seen him
on grug with the family standing around him
what are you doing
playing to eep yeah wow
like i was up all night cuz like all these ideas just kept coming to me
grug lifts his tunic a boa constrictor is wrapped around his waist
is that a snake
new and improved
its even self tightening
the constrictor squeezes grug till he turns blue
grug smacks it and it relaxes a little
what is that on your head
its called desperation
grug strokes his weird fake rasta hair
swings his long hair around i call it a rug
rhymes with grug
and this one
i call it a ride
rhymes with grug
grug regards a boulder as if its a ferrari
that doesnt its gonna get us places faster than shoes
grug climbs on top of the rock facing the wrong way
try to keep up
he leans forward
the car rolls downhill and smashes through a redwood toppling it
i wish i had a ride
his face slathered with reddish mud
painting is a thing of the past
i call this a snap shot
grug takes a huge flat stone and smashes it against thunk forcibly transferring the mud image to the rock
grug shows the croods
lets do it again
i think i blinked
thunk passes out
wearing wooden sunglasses
they are effectively wearing blindfolds
i call them shades
the sun doesnt hurt my eyes anymore
where do you get these great ideas
since i dont have a brain theyre coming from my stomach
down deep below and then up again into my mind
thunk walks into a tree
all the other croods raise their shades in time to see grug walk over a cliff
we have to keep moving
see i got ideas i got thoughts
on grug lifting a huge flat rock over his head
i call it a mobile home
isnt that something
a huge beast bunny jumps into the opening of the rock
grug is smashed flat
standing on one side of a primitive teeter totter
and im calling this one a lifterator
grug tosses a massive boulder on the opposite end
grug is launched into the sky
grug becomes a speck in the sky
he is hit by lightning
i almost feel sorry for him
grug falls back down onto the teeter totter dislodging the boulder from the other side
the boulder rolls back down onto grug
hah no i dont
guy is rowing a shell boat with everyone inside
what are you trying to do grug
burned and battered laying in the bottom of a turtle shell boat
ugga is attending to his injuries
i thought if i could have ideas like guy maybe eep would listen to me
maybe she wouldnt want to go with guy
ugga gets a pained look on her face
oh grug is that what this is all about
ugga is about to confess her thoughts of going to tomorrow with guy when grug interrupts her
and i also thought it would kill your mother
so you know
the view of the mountain is beautiful
thousands of birds fly overhead darkening the sky
the shell boat hits the shore
the croods step out onto land
an explosion goes off on a nearby mountain
a plume of magma bursts from the water in the distance
grug looks around for shelter and spots a cave
hurry up lets go
the croods dont want to move
no more caves grug
were gonna jump on the sun and ride it to tomorrow with guy
wait so youre all going to do this
silence from the croods answers his question
thunk joins the others
its the last straw
you have to stop worrying for all of us
its my job to worry
its my job to follow the rules
the rules dont work out here
they kept us alive
that wasnt living that was just not dying
theres a difference
ugga everyone you have to listen to me
ugga doesnt move
we would be dead if we listened you
grug is stunned
we have to follow guy now
grug slowly turns around to face guy
he is smoldering
grug lunges toward guy screaming
grug attacks guy they fall down an embankment
grug chases guy across a trembling landscape
this is pointless
were running out of time
everything is collapsing
youre being irrational and counterproductive
big words anger me
belt throws fruit at grug
the fruit hits grug square in the face
he doesnt stop
remember how you were this morning
you changed remember
guy comes to a sudden stop hes stepped in a small puddle of tar
grug wipes his eyes clean of fruit
no no no wait
guy and grug do a slow motion plunge over a tar fall
as they descend grug swings at guy coating himself with tar
grugs arms are held like glue
his punches stop well short of guys face
guy and grug arrive in a wide pool of tar
they sink slowly
what is this stuff that saves you from my punches
the tone of guys voice sinks in
grug ceases his attack
you have to stop struggling
i have to get back to them
grug looks to guy
no one gets out of this
grug gets it
grug looks at guy again he needs more than that
guy takes a deep breath this is going to be hard
i was little when it happened
the last thing my parents told me was dont hide
follow the sun
youll make it to tomorrow
this resonates with grug
a thread of light trickles through the storm falling just near enough to guy he can gather it in his palm
you followed the light
my daughter is a lot like you
shes like you
she loves you but always forgets to say it
just like you forget to tell her
grug ponders this
a change comes over grug
he focuses on guy
this hits grug hard
i guess i was just busy keeping them all alive
guy considers grug
thats what dads do
he regards guy in a different light
he sees him not as a boy but a man
someone good enough for his little girl
but we cant do that from here
we need one of your ideas
the music turns
you can do it
buoyed by grugs encouragement guy swings into action mode
emergency idea generator activate
belt hits guy in the head with a rock
ive got it
we are tracking with the macawnivore
suddenly the big cat stops
his eyebrows raise
macawnivores pov a female macawnivore puppet
yeah i know
but hes doing the best with what he has
grug and guy are holding bones connected to the puppet
belt signals to guy
there he is
belt i want romance drama sincerity
belt makes music which grabs the macawnivores attention
okay he sees us
belt plays a little melodramatic tune
grug halfheartedly moves the bones hes holding
thats our cue
now work it
the puppet starts shaking its tail
hes not coming over
i dont think our puppet looks scared enough
ill show you scared
hand me those acting sticks
grug shakes the puppet and makes a frightening sound of terror
suddenly the macawnivore leaps forward and jumps on the puppet
he grabs it and pulls it up out of the tar bringing grug and guy along with it
grug and guy hang on to the bones of the puppet frame
the macawnivore shakes the puppet pulling it out of the tar along with grug and guy
the puppet breaks apart the macawnivcore turns to grug and guy
he is not pleased
da da daaaaaa
the macawnivore dashes towards the pair
they try to run from him
the macawnivores paws slip slowly backwards into the nearby tar hes stuck
the tar snaps him back and throws him far from grug and guy
belt blows a whistle signalling a field goal
you did it
grug pats guy on the back
grug realizes his hand is stuck to guys back
the croods come running to help them
grug and guy turn to see the rest of the croods
grug waves to the family with guy stuck to his hand
hey were okay
the family stops to take this in
yeah were okay
the ground shakes violently
meteors stream across the sky
grug knows his answer
take us to tomorrow
rushing up the gun sight into the bright rays of the sun
were gonna make it
when the croods rush toward tomorrow it is a golden ethereal image created by a perfect alignment of sun clouds and mountain
from the croods pov it looks as if they can cross a solid bridge of clouds and climb onto a waiting sun
you were right
there it is
we can do it
we can ride it to tomorrow
even grug is taken with the sight its there after all
the croods stare at the open meadow across from them
tremors violently shake the ground
when the rift opens in front of them the hot gasses and blasts of hot ash burst the clouds from beneath
the debris shades the sun revealing a very earthly landscape beyond
from the croods perspective tomorrow vanished before their eyes
a shockwave knocks a large chunk of rock off the edge the croods are standing on blowing them backwards
i dont understand
the sun was right here
it was right here
a gargantuan jet of ash stabs at the sky
ugga pulls the croods away from the ledge
she herds them back toward the gunsight
we have to go back to the cave
hurry hurry stay together
lets keep moving
everybody hold my hand
thunk lets go
lets stay together
but grug doesnt join them
instead grug takes a step toward the precipice peering into the curtain of ash as if trying to burn a hole straight through it
whats wrong with you
grug well die if we stay here
grug spies a wispy shaft of light struggling through the ash cloud
he holds up his hand to feel it
a beam of light settles on his palm
grug is enlightened
softly to grug grug
listen to me
weve gotta get back to that cave
grug looks back at his family huddled terrified
the picture of what he would have wanted in the beginning
the sight bothers him
grug turns to face them
no more dark
no more hiding
no more caves
whats the point of all this
to follow the light
a smile breaks across eeps face her dad has answered the question
i cant change
i dont have ideas
but i have my strength
and right now thats all you need
we dont know whats over there
its too risky
its a chance
belt wipes a tear off his face
ill take that chance
grug lifts guy above his head
you know ive wanted to throw you away ever since i met you
thats a joke right
whats a joke
grugs comment freaks guy out
another angle shows grug with a twinkle in his eye
belt puts on his helmet for safety
with a titanic effort he hurls guy in to the void
the croods wait an eternity
then a horn sounds
he made it
he made it
youre not coming are you
when you make it so will i
grug hurls thunk
ugga kisses grug
she whispers in his ear
you did good
grug wipes a tear from uggas eye
then lifts her above his head
he hurls her across
gran is next in line
no mush just throw me
grug lifts her above his head
you surprised me today
grug smiles and throws her next
landing on the other side still alive
more cliff falls away
now the distance is even greater
eep is next in line
time to go
i have too much to say to you
i need to fix everything and i dont have time
i can fix it
grug embraces eep
this works good
what do you call it
i was thinking of calling it a hug
clears his throat
because it rhymes with grug
but you can change it if you want
i like a hug
i love you
eep takes in the full effect of her dads words
the ground begins to shake and break apart around them
dad im scared
never be afraid
the gap grows wider
grug lifts eep and makes the greatest throw of his life
the tumult parts briefly
grug can see his entire family safe on the other side
he waves a last goodbye
to his surprise a shaft of sunlight has settled on his open hand
i see him
the family waves to grug to let him know they are okay
grug is startled by another earthquake
the ground is ripping itself apart as meteors begin to fall around him
grug dodges falling debris and lighting and manages to crawl into a nearby cave a familiar place for him
grug grabs two pieces of flint and starts clicking them together just as guy did earlier
grug has created his very first fire
hey i did it
another earthquake shakes the cavern
grug moves over to a wall and uses some nearby mud to paint a portrait of his family
he paints each member individually and then looks longingly at the family he will never see again
the torch begins to go out
grug blows on it and is startled by the massive macawnivore beast growling at him
the macawnivore blows out the torch
another meteor hits the cave with a loud boom
the macawnivore stops growling and starts blowing on the torch along with grug
it is just as frightened as grug
grug reaches out and pets the now gentle carnivorous beast
grug and the macawnivore huddle together in a prehistoric armistice
when suddenly grug hears the dim tone of eeps shell signal
he rushes to the entrance to the cave
he surveys the raging cataclysm outside the cave as the world is being torn asunder
he hears the shell alarm blow two more times
his family is in trouble
theyre in trouble
the scale of his problem sinks in
how do i get across
what would guy do
what would guy do
something occurs to grug
what would i do
he absent mindedly hands the torch to the macawnivore
grug closes his eyes and concentrates
the ember of a thought flickers to life in grugs brain
grug uses a log to wipe tar all over a giant rib cage
grug runs out of the cave and into a nearby field and startles a pack of nesting piranha owls
he turns back to the macawnivore
the meat eating birds begin to chase grug
grug leaps onto the macawnivores back as the birds move in closer
the ground begins to break up violently as lakes empty themselves and entire forests turn sideways
the macawnivore rushes into a giant rib cage that grug has coated with tar
the piranha owls hit the rib cage and stick to it
as they fight to free themselves the rib cage lifts off the ground
grug takes a giant tree branch ignites it and uses it as a rudder scaring the piranha owls and prompting them to fly in one coherent direction
as the cage flies above the fiery landscape grug sees douglas sitting forlornly with the shell still in his mouth
grug doesnt even debate it he runs back for the little monstrosity
hey i know that guy
grug jumps out of the cage and rushes over to grab the gerbils
then grug notices a familiar liyote hiding under a nearby rock
he grabs the liyote
grug sees the trip gerbils stranded as well
grug twirls the trip gerbils around his neck like a scarf
a roar builds behind grug the pyroclastic flow is speeding closer
grug catches up to the lumbering blimp cage
he pushes it to go faster
the pyroclastic cloud blasts up the narrow passage
finally with grugs strength the cage clears the edge of the cliff
the cloud hits them all swallowing the cage like a speck
standing at the edge of the cliff alone blowing her shell horn
behind her sandy howls
gran puts a comforting arm around her grandchildren even she has a tear in her eye
the ground begins to shake softly
its not safe here
ill tell her
gran walks up to eep
eep continues to blow her shell horn
eep and gran share a moment
eep breaks into tears
gran looks at her shell horn and blows it loudly
eep is happily surprised
the whole family even guy steps up next to eep and begins blowing their shell horns
its clear from eeps expression she has no intention of budging
i never got to tell him
ugga appeals to eep
eep if your dad were here he would tell wow you sound just like him
ugga looks up
guy looks up
everyone looks up
he did it
hes riding the sun
but not very well
everybody out of the way
grug crashes near the family
they run to meet him
wheres the danger
who blew their shell
but all grug sees is his astonished family staring back at him
eep runs to him hugs him ferociously nearly knocking him down
i love you too
the rest of the croods begin running to grug
grug hugs each of them like never before
one two three four five six
grug puts his arm around guy
belt wants to be acknowledged as well
and a half
all the animals join in hugging grug
and eight and nine
douglas runs up and licks thunk
dad you saved him
well a boys gotta have a pet
suddenly the group rises up as the macawnivore stands near them
turns out im a cat person
grug notices a tail sticking out of chunkys mouth
chunky spits out the trip gerbils
he grins sheepishly
the trip gerbils run to gran knocking her over in their excitement
you really need to see this
the whole family takes this amazing view in then looks to grug for his decision
we should go there
rushing toward a shoreline covered in dense palms gentle waves lapping at the sand
on eep fixing her hair
we pull out to see the whole family preparing for a family photo
this is me
my names eep
and this is my family
if you werent clued in by the sun tans and pets were not exactly cavemen anymore
grug has a wonderful picture making contraption they are about to experience
the slab of rock smacks them all in the face leaving the first family photo
lets do that again
i think i blinked
back to the shoreline rushing ever closer to the beach
our world is still plenty harsh and hostile
but now we know the croods will make it
on belt riding on the back of the crocopup delivering a drink to gran pull out to reveal she is in a sled hitched to a team of liyotes
the liyotes are tending to her
gran sips her drink
because we changed the rules
the ones that kept us in the dark
on ugga sharpening a spear
the macawnivore comes in to frame with grug riding on top
ugga tosses him the spear
eep flips from out of the trees
she blows her horn to call guy and the bearowl for a ride
and because of my dad who taught us that anyone can change
the macawnivore leaps through the trees onto a broad beautiful beach with grug and ugga atop
release the baby
well sort of
thunk breaks through the trees riding a landwhale
sandy and belt are riding the crocopup
eep and guy are riding the bearowl
so from now on well stay out here
the first camera picks them up as it reaches the beach
it follows the croods as they turn and ride toward a sunrise
where we can follow the light
belt and sandy poke their heads up at the base of the screen
da da daaaaaaaaaaa
