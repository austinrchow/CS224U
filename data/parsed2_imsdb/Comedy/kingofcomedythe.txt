behind the opening credits we watch a montage of rupert pupkin making his daily rounds as a messenger delivering manila envelopes and packages to various new york offices always courteous
and polite in his demeanor pupkin is an attractive looking young man just past thirty and dressed in a stylish blue suit broad tie and wide collared shirt
his shoes are neatly polished his hair carefully groomed
as the montage continues we see that he has finished his deliveries and is walking rapidly towards his destination
it turns out to be a television theater north of times square whose marquee announces the jerry langford show
it is dusk and the show is about to break
there is a very small crowd already positioned at the stage door a few young girls a few curious passers by who have stopped to see who will emerge
three professional autograph hunters are clustered together mae a lady in her sixties wears a red velvet dress a lace hat and much too much rouge
sidney is in his mid twenties tall badly complexioned slicked hair but otherwise neatly dressed
he carries a brown lunch bag
celeste is an enormously fat woman in her mid thirties
she wears a large cape to conceal her obesity
a middle aged man dressed in a corduroy suit emerges from the backstage door which is guarded by a large white haired policeman
the non professionals in the crowd just peer at the man but mae immediately steps in front of him with her autograph book raised
to the man are you somebody
no honey im just a working stiff
the man keep walking and mae returns to her cohorts just as pupkin arrives
coolly hello rupert
who did you get
pupkin carefully places himself near the door a step or two away from the other professionals
to sidney i got mr
raf vallone outside
to sidney about pupkin hed never tell you anyway sidney
then i got him again at the pierre at four oclock
be a dear mae
i dont happen to have mr
you know what i want for him
but i have only six barbras left
you know how difficult she is to work with
i dont have her even once
to mae maybe rupert would help you
pupkin shoots a hostile glance back at celeste
would you do that rupert
you dont feel about barbra the way i do
ill give you mr
burt reynolds too
needling rupert look sidney rupert doesnt do that sort of thing
how about it rupert
ill give you whoever you want
sidney starts pulling little white cards out of his paper bag and reading them off
and shes not so easy to work with either
youre wasting your time
pupkin has been trying to remain apart from the other three
finally he turns to sidney
im just not interested
this isnt my whole life you know
whats that supposed to mean that its my whole life or sidneys or maes
it is so my whole life
shut up mae
what about your mother
isnt she part of your life
its her whole life too
the show breaks
the doors swing open and people pour out
the crowd around the backstage door swells
to the crowd if you want jerrys autograph give me your piece of paper and ill send it backstage
a number of people in the crowd hand in pieces of paper
pupkin is standing next to a young couple about college age
the young girl has just sent in her paper
to the girl what are you going to do with jerrys autograph
i dont know
maybe ill sell it
ill tell you what shes going to do with it
shes going to pin it on her bulletin board and have an orgasm
the young girl laughs unself consciously
langfords limousine waits directly in front of the stage door
mae has engaged the chauffeur who stands at the door of the car in conversation
wearily no mae
i dont mean now
ill get right out
the chauffeur smiling shakes his head
a plain looking girl in a black raincoat and black floppy hat stands on the street side of the limousine carefully watching mae and the chauffeur talk
but ive never been in one
we hear a cry as a celebrity emerges from the backstage door
mae turns and goes back towards the door
the policeman is handing out the autographs
suddenly langford emerges flanked by three pages husky young men in their early twenties dressed in theater uniforms
there is screaming and some yelling of langfords name
langford pays no attention
smiling nervously he makes his way towards the limousine
the chauffeur stands at the rear of the car holding the door
langford enters the car and then suddenly springs back
the girl in the black raincoat and black hat has hidden herself in the back seat of the limousine
the three pages who have already turned and headed back toward the theater hear the commotion and swing around
the girl who we shall come to know as marsha hides herself in the far end of the limo so two of the pages go around to the far side
of the car and start pulling her out while the third page moves into the limo from the street side
she fights like a wildcat but the pages slowly manage to drag her out
during the struggle langford stands amid the crowd a bit shaken
pupkin stands next to him staring at him
when finally catches langfords eye pupkin smiles pleasantly
to langford who barely listens how the hell did that girl get in there
jesus they certainly dont give you very good protection do they
langford says nothing glancing nervously at pupkin
look at you here
who the hell is watching you
any one of these freaks could just walk right up to you and do whatever he wants
a couple young girls are pressing against langford
how can we get to talk to you
just a minute
this is crazy
pupkin straightens up for action
yelling at the crowd okay
pupkin wades through the crowd towards the limousine pushing sidney and mae among others out of the way
langford follows in the path pupkin is clearing
didnt you hear me
come on people have a heart
the pages have succeeded in pulling the girl out of the far door of the limo just as pupkin and langford arrive at the near door
the chauffeur has been blocked by the crowd from opening the door so pupkin opens it
to langford go ahead jerry
langford slips in quickly
he looks up at pupkin who is holding the door smiling pleasantly
thanks very much
pupkin stares at langford for a moment and then slides into the limo next to him closing the door behind him
i hate to bother you like this jerry but could i speak to you for a minute
id like to but
i know youre a busy man
i promise not to take very long really
but i need your advice
pupkin looks down at his hand which has been badly scratched
you dont have a handkerchief do you
jesus these people will kill you for a cufflink
langford hands him a monogrammed handkerchief then checks his watch
if you have to be somewhere i dont mind talking as we drive
you can drop me off anywhere
sorry but ive got a strict rule never to
i put myself on the line for you jerry
reluctantly langford signals with his head to his chauffeur to start moving
as the car moves through new york traffic pupkin and langford talk
im grateful for this chance to talk to you
i hope im not boring you
ill let you know
im rupert pupkin jerry
i know that the name itself doesnt mean very much to you but it means an awful lot to me believe me
maybe youve seen me outside your show and wondered who i am
well right now im in communications but by nature im a stand up comedian
i know what youre thinking oh no
not another one
and i wouldnt take up even one minute of your time if i wasnt absolutely convinced of my talent
im really good jerry believe me im dynamite
now youre probably wondering if im so good why havent you caught my act somewhere right
well up to now ive been biding my time developing my act slowly and carefully so that when my big break finally comes im ready like you were that night
paar got sick and you sat in for him
i was there that night in the theater
that was the most important night of my life until tonight of course
pupkin fishes a cigarette case out of his jacket pocket flips it open and offers one to langford
i dont smoke
pupkin returns the pack to his pocket
i just carry them as a courtesy
how about a cough drop
smiling indulgently no thanks
i dont cough
i try not to but sometimes you know am i making any sense
smiling go on
well that night you did paar i walked out of the theater like i was in a dream
all of a sudden i knew what i wanted
i started catching your guest appearances on sullivan and taping them and when you got your own show it got to be a kind of regular thing
i studied how you built to your one liners nice and relaxed like you were chatting and how you delivered the jokes without leaning too much on them without saying
heres the punchline folks
and i watched the way you played off dead audiences how you let those long silences build until people couldnt stand it and then the way you got them off
the hook with that slow smile
you were my college of comedy jerry like a kind of teacher a friend
i know it sounds crazy but when you watch someone every night
but thats all in the past
what im trying to say is this
im ready now
ive finished the course
and im thinking as we sit here talking is this it
is this that one big break
is it jerry
there is a long pause
what was the name
im rupert jerry
i know what youre saying
but things dont work that way
you cant just walk onto a network show without any experience
youve got to start at the bottom
but thats where i am
youve got to work your way up learn your trade in front of live audiences start playing the little clubs
but that can take years jerry
look at me
im already years old
people my age are way ahead of me
ive got some catching up to do and i need your help
what do you say jerry
all im asking you to do is listen to my act
is that asking too much
i get calls from agents every day
all they want
i tried getting an agent
i did jerry
but you know how it is
you cant get an agent unless youre working and you cant get work unless youve got an agent
or unless you know somebody
and the only person i know is you jerry
there is a long pause
look why dont you call my office
oh i knew youd say that jerry
you dont know how many times ive had this conversation in my head
and this is the way it always turns out
thats why i had to sort of invite myself into the car tonight
i know its kind of presumptuous and i really appreciate the time youve given me
but breaks like this dont just happen
you have to make your own breaks
the limousine starts slowing down as it pulls up before u
langford gets out
langford turn to pupkin looking to get rid of him as cleanly and gracefully as possible
langford extends his hand
pupkin goes to shake it but his hand is wrapped in the handkerchief
he extends his left hand
langford shakes it awkwardly
nice meeting you rupert
i hope it all works out for you
i dont know how to repay you
im a little short on cash this evening but if you dont mind some good hearty food id be honored to take you to dinner
thanks but some people are waiting for me
oh i understand
well then maybe i could repay you with a joke
langford is starting to walk into the building
wait a minute
the first night you do your show from the coast you open this way
good evening ladies and gentlemen its great to be back here in southern california where you can wake up in the morning and listen to the birds coughing
nodding but unsmiling not bad
pupkin calls after langford who heads for the entrance to his building
consider it a gift
how about lunch
turning back before he enters the building call my office
pupkin waves with his bandaged hand notices langfords handkerchief and unwraps it
to the handkerchief thanks jerry
the camera moves in for a close up of pupkin in a kind of daze
pupkin and langford stand at the edge of the foyer waiting for the maitre d to seat them
vincent the owner spots them and hurries over
im sorry mr
to pupkin angrily how did you get in
thats alright vincent
pupkins a friend of mine
puzzled oh i see
now if youd be good enough to find us a nice table
pupkin pushes a five dollar bill into vincents hand
this way please
vincent leads pupkin and langford to the bullpen a select spot in a corner of the restaurant
here you are
enjoy your lunch gentlemen
is eddie here today vincent
ill send him over
a waiter arrives and hands them the menu
our specialty today is rizzofino dolce acqua a la marinara con spezi
sounds like a new opera
what comes with it
the three laugh
the waiter leaves
you look tired jerry
it shows does it
its all these problems with the show
that and the custody suit
i was sorry to read about that jerry
charlene never should have gotten the kids
if theres anything i can do
i appreciate it rube
just talking about it a little with you helps
he is a small slightly bald man with greying hair and a goatee
he wears a foulard under an open necked shirt
he carries a long sketch pad
he immediately sets up a small easel and starts sketching
hasnt eddie already done you
you were saying
well ive been giving a lot of thought to your situation jerry ever since i saw you starting to lose ground in the ratings
and i think i know what the problem is
too many of the same faces
sure people are getting tired of these people who live off game shows and talk shows and cant really do anything
theyve seen em and heard em till they cant stand it anymore
you know maybe youre right rube
im sure i am
when a show runs out of surprises it loses its audience
a young girl stands before pupkin and langford
she hands pupkin her autograph book
whats your name dear
writing to dolores who sensed greatness
reading it thanks mr
the girl leaves
you see what i mean
what you need on the show is some unknown quantity some brilliant talent making his television debut
imagine the suspense
who is this young guy
how will he do with the eyes of all america on him
something like that has got to help
and thats where you come in
believe me jerry id give you the credit you deserve and ill stick with you
anytime you need me ill be there doing a few minutes at guild scale
id be grateful rube
i really would
all finished mr
eddie turns the caricature so pupkin and langford can see it
its a picture of the two of them facing each other and smiling
oh jerry you sneaky
looks good eddie
the waiter arrives with a bottle of champagne
compliments of mr
eddie hangs the picture of langford and pupkin on the wall behind them among the hundreds of other caricatures from bankhead to sid caesar to bette davis
the camera pans over these
we hear the champagne pop
how does your afternoon look
what have you got in mind
well weve still got time to catch the cubs and the mets out at shea
but first a toast
to you rube and your success
pupkin takes langfords handkerchief and folds it reverentially tucking it carefully into his breast pocket
he claps his hands together a few times for joy and dashes into the street to hail a cab
langford enters his apartment
it is tasteful modern spacious and empty
a floodlight shines on a single setting at the end of a long dinner table
he walks over to a large aquarium and sprinkles some food for the fish
to the fish say hello to jerry
on a shelf above the aquarium stand three pictures one of two boys roughly eight and eleven flanked by a shot of each boy alone
langford walks to the end of the table where a covered dish and a new york post await him
he lifts the covered dish which reveals a large cold salmon
to the fish say hello to jerry
langford begins poking at the fish with his fork
the phone rings
he answers it
its marsha jerry
did you get my note
i left it on the back seat
did you get it
i dropped it there before they pulled me out
those guys hurt me jerry
icily who gave you this number
dont be angry with me jerry
i didnt know what else to do ive been trying you every five minutes i miss you baby
langford hangs up the phone and then takes it off the receiver
say goodbye to jerry
he shakes his head wearily returns to his dinner and turns to the inside pages of the new york post
a cab pulls up in front of an all night florist shop
pupkin dashes out of the cab and into the florists
the cab waits
pupkin dashes out of the florists clutching a single red rose
he hops back into the cab which starts moving
the cab pulls up in front of gils steaks and chops a restaurant of little distinction that has a few checkered tableclothed tables in the rear and a long bar
at the front
pupkin stares through the window of the bar at rita the bargirl an attractive somewhat shopworn blonde in her late twenties
pupkin goes to the near end of the sparsely populated bar
rita comes over
pupkin smiles knowingly
a beer please miss
rita serves him a heinekens
she stares at him searching his face
how have you been rita
she stares again
youre not rupert pupkin
pupkin smiles broadly
how the hell did you find me
sally gardner i met her after a matinee
arent you glad to see me
how is old sally
the same i guess
you know two kids a nice husband living in clifton
a lot of the kids in our class have moved back
what are you doing here
i just thought id say hello
here i brought you a little something
recognizing his style oh yeah mr
dont forget to put in an aspirin
it lasts longer
rita fills a glass of water and puts in the rose
nothings gonna keep it alive in this place
how have you been dear sweet rita
i dont have an aspirin
maybe a rolaids would work
pupkin pulls out a pack of rolaids and hands one to rita who smiles vaguely and drops it into the glass
well what are you up to these days rupert
didnt you know youd see me again
you still going to the movies
youre looking as beautiful as ever
i was a real knockout
i thought so
well here i am
local cheerleader makes good
i voted for you for most beautiful
i didnt have the nerve to tell you then but i guess its alright now
well nothing terribles gonna happen if thats what you mean
there is an awkward pause
pupkin stares admiringly at well how are things with you rupert
everythings starting to break
is that right
as a matter of fact thats why im here
ive known about this place for a long time
i just didnt want to make my move until i had something to offer you
everythings a question of timing
rita stares at pupkin as he rattles on
whats the matter
rita shakes her head in disbelief and chuckles
jesus christ rupert pupkin
smiling the two of us are often confused
hes the one with the famous father
pupkin waits for a laugh
rita just keeps shaking her head
pupkin looks around
critically you like this place
why you got something better
what are you doing tonight
rita starts laughing
smiling reluctantly whats so funny
still laughing you call me up all junior and senior year
night after night after night right
and every time im wondering when is this guy going to stop talking and ask me out
well now i know the answer
august twelfth nineteen seventy six
it only took you ten eleven years to work up to it
if i had asked you out
would you have gone
rita starts laughing again
because i thought you were a jerk
i was right
but that guy isnt me anymore
i look at my picture in the yearbook and i dont even recognize myself
im not the same guy rita
a bull necked man in his early forties enters
he waves a brief hello to rita as he walks by
rita smiles and the man takes a seat at the far end of the bar
to pupkin excuse me a minute honey
im not honey
rita goes to the far end of the bar and serves the man a beer
they chat briefly as pupkin watches uneasily
finally pupkin downs his beer and raises his glass
the man gets ritas attention for pupkin
rita returns to pupkin and serves him another beer
im in the mood to celebrate tonight
why dont we go to this nice restaurant i know talk over and times get to know each other all over again
well tomorrow night i thought wed go out again talk some more get to know each other even better
how much what
how much do we have to get to know each other
i dont understand
emphatically how much do we have to get to know each other before we start talking about that job
im not talking about any job
then whats this big offer you were talking about
right now im asking you for a date
how about it
im sorry rupert
but im busy
but this is the biggest night of my life
ive already got a date
the man at the end of the bar raises his glass
rita goes to the far end of the bar
she pours him another beer and settles against the bar resuming her chat with him
pupkin looks for a moment and downs his beer
he raises his glass
rita returns to him
is that your date
none of your business
what do you want to go out with him for
hes a good friend of mine
tell him youre busy
whats so important about tonight
you dont understand
its been really nice seeing you rupert
thanks for dropping in
but ive got some work to do
rita leaves pupkin and returns to the far end of the bar where she once again resumes talking with the man
pupkin sits for a moment gets up slowly and heads for the john
he enters the john and goes to the farthest of the three urinals
a moment later the man enters
he goes to the nearest of the three urinals
the two men stare at the wall before them but the obvious tension between them renders them both incapable of relieving themselves
pupkin glances over at the mans face then immediately turns back to the wall as the man turns to look at him
the man glances quickly at pupkin and then returns to staring at the wall
pupkin sneaks a furtive glance at the mans penis
the man sneaks a furtive glance at pupkins penis
pupkin emerges from the john followed a moment later by the man
they resume their seats at each end of the bar
a third man has come in and is seated midway between pupkin and the man
rita walks over reluctantly
listen to me for a second
i have work to do rupert
im at the start of something really big
i dont want to talk about it here but its going to happen soon and its going to be great for both of us
so see that guy some other night
rita turns to go
but i havent finished
rita returns to the man and pours him another beer
pupkin sits for a few moments then downs his beer quickly
again he raises his glass
the man leans over the bar and tells rita something
she opens a bottle of beer and hands it to the man who slides it down the bar towards pupkin
as the beer reaches the middle of the bar the third man seated midway between pupkin and the man raises his beer glass to take a sip just as the
sliding beer bottle passes under his hand
the bottle stops right in front of pupkin who takes it and slides it back with equal force
at this moment the third man in the middle has finished his sip and has just placed the third mans glass on the counter
the beer bottle collides with the third mans glass creating a mess
rita glares at pupkin as does the third man
pupkin shrugs an apology and rita cleans up the mess
to the third man ill get you another one
as rita cleans up the mess and pours a fresh beer the man walks down the bar towards pupkin
he leans over him and puts a supposedly friendly paw on his shoulder
pupkin glances distastefully at the mans hand on him
to pupkin look friend
im trying to have a nice civilized conversation with the young lady
be a good little lad huh and give us a break
pupkin looks up at the man who pats him on the back in a gesture of fraudulent friendship and menace
with an effort the man controls his temper and returns to his seat at the end of the bar
pupkin instantly raises his glass
the man advances towards pupkin with another bottle of beer
pupkin watches passively as the man pours half the bottle into pupkins breast pocket and slams the half empty bottle on the counter
the man walks down to the end of the counter where a smiling rita is waiting
pupkin again gulps his beer down
rita and the man stare at pupkin expecting him to raise his glass and call for another beer
pupkin just sits there
after a few moments rita and the man resume their conversation but they keep glancing over at pupkin expecting him to interrupt them with a call for beer at any
pupkin continues to sit there
just as rita and the man have settled back into their conversation pupkin falls like a stone from the barstool onto the floor
he lies motionless
rita and the man look at pupkin for a moment while the handful of other patrons glance at him and return to their drinks
rita leaves the bar and goes to the rear of the restaurant disappearing into the kitchen
as she does the man walks over to where pupkin is lying inert and prods him cruelly with his foot
cmon schmuck wake up so i can kick your ass outta here
the man turns to the kitchen to see if rita is returning
as he does pupkin carefully opens one eye grabs a free chair from a nearby cocktail table rises and bangs the man smartly over the head
the man falls out cold
pupkin straightens up quickly as the other patrons look on with interest
pupkin brushes off his suit which is blue just like the mans and stands above the man just as the man stood above him his back to kitchen
rita emerges from the kitchen with the owner mr
nichols and a large black to nichols he was making trouble one minute and the next he was on the floor
rita automatically reaches out as she talks for what she thinks is the mans arm
instead pupkin turns around smiling leaving her too startled to speak
nichols and the cook lift the man to his feet
okay buddy here we go
nichols and the cook lead the man who is still groggy out of the bar as rita continues to stare at pupkin with a mixture of curiosity and amusement
where do we eat tonight
we are in the kitchen watching two dishes being chopped shredded and boiled in deep fat
the activity is frantic
we follow the two dishes as a waiter carries them from the kitchen to a booth where pupkin and rita are talking
it is a painfully plain restaurant shaped in a rectangle with booths lining either side and a row of little tables in between
at the back is the kitchen and two phone booths facing each other
an old chinese woman mans the cash register by the door
the waiter sets the dishes down before rita and pupkin and clears an enormous plate of spare rib bones from ritas place
rita hands the waiter her empty cocktail glass
rita and pupkin are facing one another
another one chan
to waiter chopsticks please
the waiter nods and leaves
so all this time youve been thinking about me huh
thats right rita
what kinds of things were you thinking
pupkin drops his eyes shyly
rita starts laughing
those kinds of things
shame on you rupert
rita i assure you there was
rupert pupkin is an unclean person
come on rita
people will hear
in a whisper rupert pupkin is an unclean person
oh come on rupert
have a little fun
waiter arrives with ritas drink and chopsticks and a beer for pupkin
this is a very important evening to me rita
did you know your nose wiggled when you talked
just the tip
like a rabbit
pause hey are we gonna eat or what
pupkin serves rita
it always looks like they put worms in this stuff
well i guess it wont kill me
this is supposed to be the finest cantonese cuisine in the city
then what happened to the tablecloths
pupkin drops his eyes
oh dont worry about it
this is fine
she takes a long drink im having a good time
so youve been devoted to me huh
i used to see you at the garden every year
oh the follies
that was the right name for em
how did you know which one was me
we all looked like chickens
what i mean is we all looked like the same chicken
i thought it was gonna be rita keane in the ice follies and i wind up looking like henny penny
rita chuckles to herself
you just didnt get the breaks
my parents didnt have the money for the right coach
but what difference does it make
she starts laughing to herself
i remember once we were down in atlanta and the ice machine broke down
we did three hours of slush
everyone was falling on their faces and hopping up with their arms open for a bow like the whole thing was planned
and the people ate it up
i liked the show
you really must have been carrying the torch
what did you think when i got married
you knew i got married
i knew it wouldnt last
you think i should have married you instead huh
peter drysdale really rita
if hed only been hit by a train
he was worth a helluva lot more dead than alive i can tell you that
rita raises her glass to the waiter who is standing nearby talking with another waiter
as she does a nice looking young man sitting in the middle aisle raises his glass of beer to her and drinks it as a kind of toast
rita smiles briefly and her eyes return to pupkin
the young man is seated behind pupkin facing rita
the waiter comes over and collects the glass
throughout the rest of the scene a subtle flirtation continues between rita and the are you seeing anyone
rita starts for a moment thinking pupkin has caught her looking at the young man
what do you mean
i want to know about the competition thats all
well tomorrow night ive got a date with joe namath you know joe
and thursday lets see im serious rita
imitating him im serious rita
in her own voice sure i see people
im not a nun rupert
i see a lot of people
chuckling you mean am i going steady
rupert im thirty one years old
what about that guy tonight
what am i supposed to do huh
sit home watching tv
hes just some guy
hes got his own aluminum siding business
he comes into the city sometimes thats all
you dont go out with him for his money
look rupert what do you think they pay me in that dump
ninety five bucks
and you dont get the worlds greatest tippers in there either
somebody has to take care of me
thats what i want to talk to you about rita
the waiter arrives with ritas drink
whos your favorite movie star
you are rupert
especially your nose
just tell me
is this some kind of game
are you going to tell me something about my character
give me his name
i cant think of anybody
youve got to have one rita
pause marilyn monroe
pupkin slowly pulls out a leather bound book from his inside jacket pocket
are we going to exchange phone numbers
pupkin expertly flips to a middle page in the book and keeping the book open his finger pointing under a name he turns the book to rita
thats her name
she signed this herself especially for me
rita starts flipping through the book curious about the other names
she isnt paying any attention to what pupkin is saying
she wasnt a great actress but she had a real gift for comedy
she died tragically you know alone like so many of the worlds most beautiful women
im going to see that doesnt happen to you rita
whos this one
pupkin checks the book
oh yeah the guy with no clothes
how about this
never heard of her
pointing to other names and thats woody allen and theres ernie kovacs hes dead and that ones lauren bacall
you dont really know any of these people
take a look at this
pupkin flips to one of the back pages and shows a name to squinting i cant make it out
this is really weird handwriting
exasperated pupkin follows the name in question with his index finger
thats robert redford
its rupert pupkin pupkin tears out the page and hands it to her shyly
rita just stares at it and back at pupkin
dont lose it
its going to be worth something in a couple of weeks
rita start laughing
thats what ive been trying to tell you
things are really breaking for me
im ticketed for stardom
rita laughs harder despite efforts to be serious
only a couple of hours ago i was talking to jerry langford the jerry langford
stop it rita
rita pulls herself together for a moment
we were talking about my doing my act on his show
suppressing a smile your act
get that guy you knew from clifton out of your head right now
youre looking at rupert pupkin rita
rupert pupkin the new king of comedy
rita starts laughing hysterically in spite of herself
getting a grip on herself im sorry
why not me rita
a guy can always get what he wants if hes willing to pay the price
all it takes is a little talent and sacrifice and the right break
if youve got a friend in the right place thats all it takes
and thats exactly what i have going for me right now
after all crazier things have happened
rita listens silently for a moment then begins to giggle
as pupkin resumes speaking we cut between rita and the young man
their flirtation picks up steam
the young man raises his eyebrows as if to ask are you interested in me
all the while pupkin rattles on
you just dont realize what a shot on the langford show can mean
thats coast to coast national tv a bigger audience than the greatest comedians used to play to in a lifetime
a shot like that means a free ticket on the comedy circuit flip wilson one week cosby the next then sonny and cher or carol burnett
and youve always got those other talk shows to fall back on carson griffin
and all that leads straight in one direction rita hollywood
thats when we really start living how does this sound to you a beach house in malibu right on the ocean
youll get a beautiful tan believe me
and wed keep a suite at the sherry
thats the only place to stay when youre big
we could get something on a top floor and look down on all our old friends in clifton and just laugh
how does that sound to you
it sounds wonderful rupert and i really hope you get what you want
but its getting late and im a working girl
you know what i mean
the telephone at the back of the restaurant starts ringing
a waiter in the background moves slowly to answer it
you going to spend the rest of your life in that place
is that what you really want talking about nothing with nothings
i thought you wanted something a little better than that and thats what im offering
every king needs a queen rita
i want you to be mine
what do you say
you really want to help me out
you see this
she points to her lower back molar a hundred seventy five bucks
if you could spare fifty say until next monday that would keep three people really happy me my landlord and my dentist
during ritas speech the waiter has been working his way from the phone booth towards the front of the restaurant
telephone for you miss
looking puzzled me
nobody knows im here
you didnt tell anybody did you
getting up what the hells going on
camera follows rita who walks to the back of the restaurant and picks up the dangling receiver in one of the two facing booths the other of which is occupied
who is this
who do you think it is
ive been staring at you all evening
where are you
the young man taps forcefully with his index finger on the glass door of his booth
rita hearing the noise turns around and finds herself staring at the young man
pupkin at the table looking over the check
he gets out a ten dollar bill
rita emerges from the booth in nervous high spirits
with repressed gaiety you know who that was the bar
i have to go back to work
how did they know you were here
gathering her things i guess i must have told them
they need someone right away
accusingly you dont even care do you
its not the bar rita
dont tell me its the bar
dont be angry
it has nothing to do with you
i had a nice dinner really
it was great seeing you again
pupkin stare at her icily
lets see a smile
why dont we finish the evening up at the bar together
end the evening where it began
after what happened there
well i could at least drop you off
hurriedly making up her face thats okay
i can manage
why dont you just go to a movie or something
dont let me spoil your evening
but that wouldnt be right
rita gets up and stands before pupkin
firmly look rupert
its been a lot of fun really
ill see you sometime huh
rita starts moving towards the door
come on rupert
im in a hurry
rita marches out with pupkin trailing behind
he throws the check and the ten dollar bill at the cashier
camera follows pupkin as he streaks out the door and jumps into the adjacent doorway immediately peering down the street
he spies the young man and rita walking about three quarters of a block down and follows them keeping out of sight
they turn occasionally to see if hes around then stop turning
they go around the corner and disappear into a large apartment building
pupkin rushes after them positioning himself across from the building
he searches the windows for some clue as to where they have gone
finally a set of lights go on on the fourth floor and a mans shadow is seen closing two sets of blinds
pupkin enters the building and finds himself in a small entranceway
the door to the lobby is locked
next to the door on the wall are listed the tenants their apartment numbers and a button next to each name
there is an intercom speaker
there are eight apartments listed on the fourth floor running from a to h
pupkin looks them over takes a deep breath and pushes a
it is an extremely well furnished studio apartment with all the requirements of a contemporary bachelor pad an imitation bearskin rug nice bookshelves including an elaborate stereo system recessed lighting
including a soft spotlight on the queen sized bed with its pseudo satin cover
the young man and rita stand in the middle of the room
rita looks about uneasily
no intercom buzzer sounds
welcome to the pleasure dome
you dont kid around do you
smiling i do alright
whats your libation
bourbon and soda
make it light
the young man goes to his chic little bar and starts fixing rita a strong bourbon and soda
he also fixes himself a strong scotch and water
as he works they talk
you from the south
thats what southern people drink
lots of bourbon
what do people from jersey drink
i make it a point to study things like that
its important to know peoples backgrounds their tastes their culture
it gives you a little head start
the young man turns from the bar and hands rita her drink
whom do i have the pleasure of serving
pleased to meat you mary
he lifts his glass to our evening
pupkin stands before the intercom
i want to talk to her
oh never mind
i must have the wrong apartment
theres no rita here
im sorry to bother you
you must have the wrong apartment
pupkin pushes b
rita is seated on the couch
the young man is putting a record on the phonograph
once again the intercom doesnt sound
pupkin has drawn another blank
leisure is americas fastest growing industry
did you know that
think about it
short work weeks more vacation
people need something to do with all that time and thats where i come in
leisure villages inc
we buy land an hour or so outside your metropolitan centers
we set up the bungalows dig some lakes lay out a golf course you know fix the whole place up so its usable
then young personable guys like me show the people around
it the guy seems tight we point out the investment factor
if hes a swinger well the bungalows are very private
if hes a sports nut we talk up skiing and fishing and tennis
the phonograph starts playing burt bachrach
whats your work mary
the young man walks back to her and stands over her
i fly for national
delighted no kidding
whats that smell
it seemed very you
pupkin yells into the intercom
said im sorry
we hear the intercom at the other end click off
pupkin pauses a moment and pushes c
rita and the young man are seated on the couch
still no buzzer
as the young man talks rita is staring at a womans shoe lying underneath a small table that holds a lamp
did you know that you have remarkable hair
you know what
i feel like going to a movie
its only twenty of ten
we can make a ten oclock show
the young man takes her hands and looks deep into her eyes
why dont we make our own movie
i dont think so
dont be so uptight
give it a chance
i want to go to the movies thats all
we can go to the movies later
rita pulls her hands away
lets stop playing games okay
im not a kid
you have something against pleasure
im just not interested in being tonights ritual sacrifice okay
shall i freshen up your drink
rita shakes her head
growing irritated what exactly did you think we were going to do up here
pupkin pushes d and waits
the young man is practically sitting on ritas lap
he has rita backed up against the end of the couch
look if youve got sexual problems lets talk about them
it helps clear the air
theres nothing wrong with me then its me
i dont even know you
then find out
sex is a great way of breaking down barriers
i dont think so
im sure this could lead to something beautiful
the young man kisses rita roughly
passive resistance huh
lets just write this thing off as a big mistake
what do you say
whats wrong with me
i just want to go home
i can see im not turning you on
smiles you noticed that huh
whats wrong with me
you really want to know
how can i put it
well its like youve got your fly open and your tongue hanging out
pupkin growing more frantic pushes e
the young man is all over rita
no buzzer sounds
im really a very sensitive person
get offa me
sometimes i write poetry
rita pulls herself away
so you wanna play hard to get huh
the young man grabs her
pupkin even more desperate pushes f
que es por favor
the young man is strong arming rita who is beginning to get frightened
lets talk this over
i admire you very much
i respect you mary
her eyes beginning to fill with terror youre hurting me
im only doing what you want
pleading on the verge of tears oh please
pupkin frantic pushes g
the young man has rita securely pinned and is starting to undo her blouse
she is desperate
afterwards youll thank me
the buzzer sounds with great force
it is one long protracted blast that breaks the young mans concentration
rita takes advantage of the distraction to grab her bag and rush out as the buzzer continues to sound
pupkin still has his finger on g as rita rushes out the exit door next to the elevator and comes rushing towards him
she is numb and emotionally exhausted
in desperation what do you want
rita keeps walking out of the entranceway and onto the street
pupkin is at her side
dont be angry with me
i was worried about you thats all
just go home and leave me alone
pupkin take off his jacket and puts if around ritas shoulders
youll need this
its getting chilly
im so bad im such a dummy
dont say that rita
everyone does crazy things
not all the time
ill get us a cab
pupkin rushes into the street and hails a cab
ext west th street between eighth and ninth avenues we see the taxi pull up in front of one of those middle class tenements a fairly well preserved six story
building with a fire escape running up the front
pupkin helps rita out of the taxi
a dime bounces at pupkins feet
stuff it big spender
pupkin pays no attention
he walks rita to her front stoop
well i guess youre entitled to come up for coffee
thats okay rita
youre tired and i know im not always the easiest guy to be with
there is a pause
puzzled what do you want rupert
softly you dont understand anything do you
i love you rita
i want to change your life
if youll only give me a chance
rita just shakes her head sadly
look what if i arranged it so you could meet jerry
youd have to believe me if you heard it from him
ill arrange that rita
well all go out to dinner some night or maybe out to his place on a weekend
the trouble with you is youve got no faith
now go to bed and get a good rest and ill see you in a couple of days
pupkin gives rita a very gentle sweet kiss on the forehead
gently now run along in
rita just stares at him
rita turns slowly and goes in
she looks back
pupkin is gone
ext madison avenue and th street day pupkin carries a large manila folder into madison
as usual he is impeccably dressed
it is a large corner office broken up by glass dividers
a receptionist sits at a desk facing the door
pupkin hands the receptionist the package
i need somebody to sign
you can sign anything you want cary grant art carney i dont care
the receptionist signs
would you mind very much if i used your phone
dont be long
pupkin takes out a little piece of paper from his suit pocket and dials a number
tense nervous may i speak to jerry langford please
jerry langford please
im calling at his request
ill call him again
thats not jerry langford the
smiling proudly thats right
thanks for your phone
pupkin approaches times square phone booth
he rests a few folders on a trash basket just outside the booth
he enters the booth and dials
jerry langford please
may i speak to jerry langford please
rupert pupkin i called earlier
how long do you expect thatll last
im at pupkin checks the number on the phone ch
ill be here for another half hour forty five minutes
please be sure he gets my message
pupkin hangs up
a shot of the clock on the allied chemical building
a nearby record store starts blasting music into the street through a loudspeaker
the music serves as background for a montage in which we cut between the clock which moves in bites towards to broadway as it looks to pupkin in the booth
that cavalcade of hustlers whores housewives kids weirdos and working people and shots of various people waiting to use the phone their impatience anger disgust
each time one of them arrives pupkin pretends to thumb through the phone book and dial a number
we watch him chatting with animation until the waiting party leaves
then we see him push the coin return to retrieve his dime
finally pupkin takes a last look at the clock
we see that it reads
he leaves the booth and goes to the trash basket
his packages have been swiped
we see pupkin enter
he is watched by a plain girl of about twenty in a black raincoat and a floppy black hat whom we recognize as marsha
pupkin emerges from the elevator and walks down the corridor looking for the door the jerry langford show offices
he finally finds it and enters
a bored plump middle aged receptionist sits behind a large desk that holds a phone receiver connected to a small switchboard
pupkin presents himself
the receptionist puts a call through
wide eyed pupkin observes the blow ups of langford talking with various celebrities
langford is seated at his desk on stage and pupkin is his guest
we see television cameras and in the background the control room
you know the secret of dieting jerry
its good for you
and its low in calories
to the camera take note of that you ladies
as a matter of fact yesterday i went to the outdoor market near where i live and i bought twenty grapefruit
the grocer looked at me and said what are you gonna do with all those
so i bent over and told him in a confidential tone im gonna take em back to florida and set em free
langford and the audience laugh heartily
holding the phone and talking to pupkin im sorry mr
pupkin but mr
langfords secretary has no record of any appointment
langfords secretary has no record of any appointment
well technically speaking i dont actually have an appointment
jerry asked me to call him today and when i couldnt get through i thought
as pupkin talks a visitor has entered and stands behind him waiting for the receptionists attention
into the phone he says mr
langford asked him to call
to pupkin mr
langfords secretary wants to know what this is in reference to
the receptionist glances past pupkin to the visitor waiting
to pupkin would you mind talking to her yourself
the receptionist hands the phone to pupkin and occupies herself with the visitor
jerry and i discussed my being on the show last night and he told me to call
i dont mind
pupkin hands the phone back to the receptionist
im supposed to wait
the receptionist listens to the phone for a moment and then hangs up
the visitor has just disappeared into the back offices
pupkin stands there smiling politely at the receptionist who returns a professional smile
who was that gentleman
pupkin indicates with a glance to the entrance to the back offices that he is referring to the visitor mr
pupkin draws a complete blank but wants to appear knowledgeable
oh i see
he takes care of our air conditioning
cathy long emerges from the back offices
she is a tall modishly dressed attractive woman in her early thirties
im cathy long
can i help you
im sorry but you are
im bert thomas assistant
hes our executive producer
im sure he is
but you see ive already talked directly with jerry about my being on the show and he told me to get in touch with him
im just here to follow up on that
what do you do mr
stand up comedy
where are you working
well right now im developing new material
well as soon as you start performing again let us know where you are and ill send my assistant down to check you out
but thats not necessary miss long
jerry and i already went over all this
does jerry know your work
i dont think he does
you dont happen to have a tape or a demo that we might listen to
ive got lots of tapes
thats no problem
why dont you just send one to us and i assure you well listen to it promptly
ill do that
i can see thatd be a lot easier for jerry
thanks a lot miss long
dont mention it mr
now if youd excuse me
cathy long leaves
pupkin left standing there smiles at the receptionist who returns another professional smile
to the receptionist thanks
pupkin comes out of the building elated
he is immediately confronted by marsha
pupkin continues to walk as marsha skips beside him
ive got to speak to you for a minute
did jerry say anything about me last night
im really in a hurry marsha
was he angry
in the car last night i saw you
did he talk about me
i thought that was you
that was some stunt
what did he say
we didnt talk about you
you know jerry
marsha thrusts an envelope into pupkins hands
give him this for me
why dont you
because i cant please
i need your help
youll be my friend forever
ill buy you something
what do you want
she takes a great messy bunch of bills out of her raincoat pockets and jams them into pupkins hands
i dont want this
i can get all i want
pupkin shrugs and pockets the money
turning cold dont try do it
we just made a deal
pupkin stares at the envelope
and dont open it
how soon can you get it to him
i dont know
couple a days
menacingly youd better
marsha turns and walks in the direction from which they came
camera follows pupkin who walks on for a block or so then opens the envelope
it contains a set of apartment keys a scrap of hand knitted woolen cloth and a note in lipstick that reads ive made you a sweater honey
come try it on
i miss you
east rd street apartment he takes out the money gave him
there are wads of tens twenties and fifties with a sprinkling of fives and ones
the hotel is just one step up from a flophouse
we see pupkin enter
we see that it is a small room furnished by the hotel in the plainest way
nicely done home made collages of show business figures decorate the drab green walls
the room is neat and clean
pupkin goes directly to a plain table which holds two tape recorders one a small cassette the other a large table tape recorder
he picks up the microphone of the larger one and speaks into it
in the following montage we hear in the background the replay of his testing testing testing and various other noises a bit of his voice taped a burst of laughter
the squeal of a tape recorder sent fast forward a sudden burst of applause a scrap of theme music
at the same time the camera pans about the room
we look at the collages which include all the obvious show business figures with a heavy emphasis on comedians from chaplin and keaton to sid caesar and woody allen
the collages also include such varied figures as jimmy carter julia childs tom seaver david brinkley muhammad ali clifford irving walter cronkite and mark spitz
there is a special kennedy section john f
and bobby framed in black jackie in mourning and a picture of teddy
there is also a trio of assassins sirhan oswald and james earl ray
there is also a talk show collage with a photo of langford in the center like a sun surrounded by snyder walters carson and griffin
one bookshelf holds a veritable library of comedy joke books biographies of comedians treasuries of american humor
another shelf holds scores of tapes in their own little boxes each one neatly marked i
langford monologues to
pupkin sitting before the tape recorder lost in thought
finally he starts the larger recorder and lifts the mike
first miss long
thanks very much for your help at the office and for passing this along to jerry
i appreciate it more than you know
pupkin stops the tape recorder and thinks again for a few beats
he then starts the large recorder
before i begin i just want to thank you for listening to this material and for the opportunity that youve given me
you know lots of people think that guys like you you know people who have made it lose their feeling for struggling young talent such as myself
but now i know from experience that those people are just cynics embittered by their own failure
i know jerry that youre as human as the rest of us if not more so
pause oh well i guess theres no point going on about it
you know how i feel
so lets get on with the show
the best of rupert pupkin
ive sketched out this little introduction in order to save you a little time
so close your eyes and imagine its exactly six oclock
youre standing in the wings and we hear rick ross and the orchestra strike up your theme song
pupkin pushes a button on the cassette and we hear the theme song of the jerry langford show followed by the voice of bert canter the announcer
and now direct from new york its the jerry langford show
tonight with jerrys special guest
pupkin deftly shuts off the cassette and substitutes his own voice for that of canters
the large tape recorder keeps rolling
the comedy find of the year making his television debut rupert pupkin the king of comedy
pupkin rapidly races the cassette tape forward then pushes down the play button
we hear a burst of thundering applause
pupkin lets the applause run for a while and then shuts it off
the large recorder keeps rolling
now you come on jerry and do your monologue
then when the time comes this is how i see you introducing me
youll say something like this
ladies and gentlemen were going to do something a little bit different tonight
it isnt often that you can call someone a sure thing in the entertainment business
after all the verdict is always in your hands
but i think after youve met my next guest that youll agree with me that hes destined for greatness
so now will you please give your warmest welcome to the newest king of comedy rupert pupkin
pupkin pushes the cassette and we hear another enormous burst of applause
pupkin lets it run listening intently
he stands up and faces a wall of his room still holding the microphone
we see that the wall is covered by a huge blow up of an audience laughing and applauding
we see a real audience laughing and applauding
pupkin strides triumphantly onto the stage nodding to acknowledge the applause
he stops center stage as the television cameras maneuver about him
a shot of the applause sign flashing then stopping
still the applause goes on
pupkin raises his hands to quiet the audience
after a few moments the applause dies down except for a pair of hands in the center of the orchestra
pupkin peers out to see who is still applauding
rita in the middle of the audience applauds enthusiastically
pupkin on stage
pupkin gives rita a special smile and nod
will somebody tell that lovely lady that the applause sign is off
the audience laughs
pupkin stands facing the audience still holding the mike
thats a possible introduction jerry
now lets move on to my act
pupkin is pacing
he is wearing another suit this one a broad lapelled grey
he is freshly shaved is hair neatly combed his shoes carrying a bright shine
he clutches a small flat box neatly wrapped with the words for jerry langford written clearly across the top in large print
cathy long emerges from one of the back corridors into the reception area
suddenly a bit shy i didnt want to take any chances with this
miss long so i uh
thought id just bring it here myself
he hands cathy long the package as though it contained nitroglycerine
we talked about this this morning did we mr
its been some day
pause well i certainly appreciate your bringing this over mr
pupkin and well listen to it as soon as possible
you dont have any idea how soon that might be
well you can try checking with us tomorrow
we might know something by then
otherwise itll have to be monday
what if i just sort of waited around here today just in case
ill stay out of the way
youd just be wasting your time mr
we wont know anything until tomorrow at the earliest
oh i wouldnt consider it a waste of time at all
id be glad to do it
look why dont you try us tomorrow
ill do that
thanks a lot miss long
and thank jerry
cathy long smiles at pupkin and goes leaving pupkin staring at a picture of langford on the wall
we fix on langford a moment and pull back to see langford in what pupkin would imagine his office to be
a large corner office furnished in royal red with high ceilings and a huge desk
potted palms and hydrangeas rest on a marble floor
langford is moving about restlessly clutching pupkins tape in one hand and waving it about
pupkin is seated on a comfortable couch
this is dynamite
shyly you think so jerry
look ive been at this for fifteen years rupert and i havent come up with anything like this not me not any of my writers
smiling with obvious pleasure well im glad you like it jerry
tell me something rube
pause how do you do it
im not asking to use the material myself
i just want to know how you langford waves his arms in a gesture of frustration how you do it well i dont know if i can explain it really
well it just sort of comes
i think about my life see mainly about the worst parts all the awful things and i just try to see them in a funny light
eagerly is that what you do
the worst parts and then you look at them in a funny light
is that what you do
more or less
its hard to describe how its happens
but thats just it rube
it doesnt happen for me
why do you think the show is in so much trouble
by the time ive done my monologue everyone has switched to carson
maybe if you did a little writing
sure jerry id do anything i could to help out
why dont you come out to my place this weekend and well hash it out
im having a few of my friends but we should be able to get a little work in
would you mind if i brought someone
smiling a girl rube
a very special girl jerry
id love to meet her
pupkin emerges lost in thought
suddenly he notices marsha waiting nearby
she doesnt see pupkin
he sneaks off
it is a bright morning
langford attempting to camouflage himself by wearing a cap over his eyes and his trench coat collar turned up his eyes hidden behind dark glasses walks out of the building
a doorman is standing by the door
thats alright thanks
we follow langford as he walks
some people dont notice
others stare but leave him alone a few commenting to their companions and pointing at him
a cab driver pulls alongside
my brother can sing and juggle at the same time
how about puttin him on your show
langford keeps walking
how about it jerry
sorry im off duty
langford stands at the corner next to a middle aged youre jerry
langford pulls his cap a little more tightly around his eyes
you know something
she giggles i undress in front of you every night and larry here doesnt mind at all
i cant get anything started with her until youre off the air
your show is ruining my sex life jerry
well then youll just have to put on a better show than i do
we watch langford continue to walk feeling what it is to be a celebrity out in public
after a few beats we we see marsha trailing langford
langford notices her and starts walking quickly
marsha walks quickly
langford starts jogging
marsha starts jogging
finally langford breaks into a sprint
marsha runs after him
langford disappears into his office building
marsha arrives several seconds later
just as marsha turns around pupkin unaware of her walks cheerfully into the building
the same middle aged plump receptionist is seated behind the desk
recognizing him oh hi
how are you
can i help you
id like to see jerry please
just a minute
the receptionist dials a number
pupkin is here
thats right to pupkin shell be with you in a minute
but i wanted to see jerry
langfords not in
miss long will take care of you
pupkin paces for a few beats
he smiles at the receptionist
a beat later cathy long comes out carrying the tape in its box
how are you today
thank you for your tape
we listened to it with great interest
and frankly mr
pupkin we saw a lot of good things in what youre doing
we feel you have good potential
very good potential
thats why ill be honest with you mr
we just dont think youre ready yet
baffled not ready
well we just dont feel right now that youre right for jerry
rapidly half listening right for jerry
some of the material
some of the one liners for instance
were not very strong
you didnt care for some of the jokes is that it
that s right
i can take care of that right way
just tell me the ones you think should go
that would be a big help
to the receptionist this is great
to cathy long which ones
well its not just that mr
you see jerry likes to panel his guests you know chat with them afterwards
and frankly we just dont feel youve got very much to talk about right now
but ive got my whole life to talk about
which is interesting to you im sure and to your wife
and to a few friends
but we feel that you should keep developing your act
test it in some live situations
there are a number of clubs in the city you can try
and after a reasonable period get in touch with us again and well be glad to send someone down to check out your progress
pupkin stares at her for a few moments as the tension grows
may i ask you a question miss long
are you speaking for jerry
lets put it this way mr
langford has complete faith in our judgment
im sorry to have to say this miss long and i certainly dont want you to take it personally but i have to tell you that i dont dont have
faith in your judgment
well im sorry you feel that way mr
but im afraid theres nothing that can be done about that
im afraid ill have to disagree with you again
with strained politeness thats your privilege mr
now if youll excuse me please i have some things to do
im sorry the news isnt better
cathy long turns to go
cathy long turns back
when are you expecting jerry in
he wont be in until very late this afternoon
cathy long stares at pupkin for a moment glances at the receptionist and then goes
pupkin takes a seat in the reception area
he smiles once more at the receptionist
the receptionist drops her eyes
a few beats go by
cathy long passes by the entranceway and glances at pupkin
pupkin continues sitting there
is there anyone else you would like to see
im happy just waiting
a few beats pass in silence
well would you mind waiting outside please mr
this is a reception area not a waiting room
pupkin remains seated
a few more moments pass
several office personnel pass by the entranceway and glance at pupkin
after a few more beats a large plainly dressed man in his mid fifties emerges from the back offices
he goes over to pupkin who stands
im raymond wirtz in charge of security for the langford organization
wirtz puts his arm on pupkins shoulder and as the following dialogue unfolds leads him out the door down the corridor and into the elevator
now i think you understand that we have certain rules here that are essential to the smooth functioning of our operation
and that without these rules we really wouldnt be able to function at our best
you follow my point
now one of these rules is that only authorized personnel and those having official business with our organization are permitted on our premises
and thats why im asking you mr
pupkin to cooperate with us
they have reached the elevator and wirtz has pushed the button
you want me to leave the building
its nothing personal mr
just doing my job
the elevator arrives
wirtz signals with his head that pupkin should enter
pupkin gets in
have a pleasant day
pupkin comes out and takes up a position outside the door preparing to wait for langford
marsha sees him and comes over to him
well did you give it to him
out of a daze huh
did you get my letter to him
hes not in there
look if you dont want to give it him okay
ill get somebody else
but dont try to con me
i told you id try and i will
im going to wait for him right here
give me the envelope huh
i saw him go in myself
but they said he wasnt in
just give me the envelope
when did he go in
ten minutes ago
look i saw him my
and he hasnt come out
ive been standing right here
now how about it
pupkin turns and goes back into the building
marsha yells after him
im staying right here
pupkin enters briskly and goes up to the receptionist
with authority tell jerry langford im here please
im sorry sir
langfords not in
i happen to know he is so would you please tell him im here
hes not in
youre putting your job on the line lady
the receptionist starts making a call inside
pupkin glances at her and walks right in to the inner corridors
he starts peering into the open doors of the offices that line the corridor
the whole place is like a gigantic maze
office personnel pass by him taking no notice of him
he continues wandering around desperately completely lost
a few beat later he spots wirtz leading a pair of security guards
pupkin keeps peering into offices quickly as he flees
the guards and wirtz finally catch up to pupkin at the steno pool and after a brief chase around the pool they catch pupkin and subdue him
they start dragging him out past the eyes of the office personnel
calling as he is dragged jerry
to wirtz youre going the have a hell of a lot of explaining to do
you had your warning mr
a close up of pupkin as he is dragged out
we watch the security guards and wirtz pitch pupkin out into the street
if we see your face again mr
pupkin well call the police
start looking for a new job
marsha comes straight up to pupkin who is brushing himself off
his eyes are glazed and distant
does he have it
abstractedly dont worry
ill get it to him
there is a pause
he asked me to go out there to his house
pupkin enters the bar restaurant
through the window we see him talking to rita
he is voluble animated
she looks skeptical with a wry smile on her face
finally we watch him extract an answer from her
she shrugs smiles and says yes
he comes walking out the door his hounded expression softened by a smile
we watch pupkin getting fitted in a new suit attended by a salesman and a tailor
we watch pupkin buy a suitcase
we watch pupkin perusing the beautiful diamond sapphire and emerald rings and we take a few moments to pan over these beautiful jewels as he sees them
finally he picks out a splendid ring with a single middle sized sapphire and hands a surprised saleslady the money in cash
pupkin and rita are seated side by side
since it is saturday morning the train is sparsely populated
a conductor has just finished taking pupkins tickets
rita is edgy
pupkin is strangely calm and a little remote
he is wearing his new suit
what are we going to do
patiently look i told you ive got some work to discuss with him
but what about me
youre with me thats fine but while you two are talking what am i going to do
you can chat with the other guests
im sure theyll be thrilled hearing about the wonderful world of draft beer
pause lets tell em im a model okay
if they ask what i do lets just say i model
you dont mind pretending just a little do you
if it make you feel better
there is a pause
this is a gas
too bad nobodyll believe it
pause after you guys are done working what happens
are we going out someplace or what
im sure jerry has something arranged
there is another pause
what do these people do for fun
do they party or do freaky things or just get drunk or
i mean what do they do i guess they just sit around and talk and enjoy each others company like anybody else
what can you talk about for three or four hours
what do you mean
theyve got plenty to talk about
they do things
all kinds of interesting things happen to them and then they talk about them
what do you think jerrys show is all about
yeah a cocktail party with no drinks
thats what all those shows are
at least they help you get to sleep
there is a pause
glumly boy this is going to be some great weekend
i thought we were gonna have some fun
smiling just take it easy rita
everythings going to be fine
we move in for a close up of pupkin who is fading out
it is a large white house with colonial columns set in the middle of a palatial estate whose rolling lawns are punctuated with fine old trees
we circle around to the back where langford a handful of his friends which can be familiar television celebrities and pupkin and rita are just finishing a lavish lunch on
a pair of servants are clearing the table and serving the coffee and desert as the scene unfolds
as we arrive we hear a loud burst of laughter
pupkin is regaling the company with stories
oh you have no idea how bad its gotten in new york
now the muggers are so efficient that each time they jump you they take your name and address and put you on a mailing list
the company chuckles and once youre on the list youre in real trouble like this friend of mine who was mugged thirty two times on his way home from work
a little laughter from the company a servant places the desert a little elegant tart in front of pupkin and rita
to servant thanks
the servant smiles
as pupkin continues his story he glances occasionally at rita who has begun to nibble at her tart
pupkin also glances conspiratorially at langford who smiles back
so what my friend does is get himself a dog one of those huge german shepherds
one night hes walking the dog in central park when he hears this voice behind him
in a german accent okay harry drop your vallet and keep your hantz over your head or i bite your little fanny off
the company breaks up
to langford looks like youve found yourself a winner jerry
looking at pupkin hes the one who found himself a winner
rita looks up smiles and blushes
the rest of the company smiles benignly and grows attentive as rita returns to eating her tart
suddenly she bites down on something hard
she fishes it out of her mouth and looks at it
the company giggles
it is the ring pupkin purchased at cartiers
the company applauds lightly and laughs
langford lifts his wine glass
to rita and rupert a short engagement and a long happy marriage
the company drinks with murmurs of hear
rita and pupkin beam
rita looks lovingly at pupkin
the pupkin have you set a date
looking pointedly at langford oh yes
i hope were all invited
the theater is packed
world series bunting hangs from the balcony and the front of the stage
we hear rick ross and the orchestra strike up mendelssohns wedding march
down one aisle walks rita accompanied by the man whom pupkin hit over the head at the bar
down the other aisle marches pupkin accompanied by langford
the audience cheers wildly
the two couples walk to the stage where a white haired official awaits them
bert canter stands at his side
pupkin and rita disengage from their escorts and stand before the official
the music stops and the audience grows quiet
we are met here in these extraordinary circumstances to join this man and this woman in holy wedlock
but before we begin let me voice a personal word of thanks to you rupert and to you rita for choosing me to perform this prestigious ceremony
because we are on prime time i am going to discard my customary remarks in favor of a few personal reflections
when i was principal at clifton high and these two were students i had very little faith that rupert here would amount to very much
but like his teachers and his fellow students i underestimated this fine young man
some say that this misjudgment is directly tied to my recent dismissal as head of the clifton school system
but let me take this opportunity to set the record straight
knowing that rupert and rita here were most certainly destined for a great career and a lifetime of happiness i voluntarily stepped down
i would only here add my own wishes to those of millions of viewers for their continued health wealth and boundless success
the official looks quickly past rita and pupkin
well be back to marry them in a minute right after this word
pupkin and rita are seated as they were
we hear the conductor calling
greenwich next stop
pupkin and rita grab their small suitcases and quickly move down the aisle towards the door
rita is peering out the window
pupkin is still lost in thought
look at that one
howd you like to live in that
or that one
what do you figure these run
the taxi stops in front of a walled lot behind which is visible a handsome english stucco home
to driver whats this
this is it
pupkin is genuinely puzzled
to driver you sure
look friend i wouldnt want to tell you how many times i made this trip
pause thatll be three seventy five
pupkin still puzzled hands him a five dollar bill
abstractedly keep it
the driver gets out and puts pupkin and ritas bags which he had stacked on the front seat onto the sidewalk
if you need a ride back just ask the guy for wayne
the camera pulls back as pupkin opens the gate and he and rita walk up the drive
pupkin and rita stand before the front door
pupkin rings after a few beats the door is opened by an indonesian houseboy
pupkin walks in right past him rita following behind
pupkin hands the houseboy the two suitcases as he talks
you must be jonno
im rupert pupkin and this is rita keane
langfords expecting us
jonno nods politely but uncertainly
langford asked you to come
would you mind taking those up
jerry and i have some work that may oblige me to stay overnight
langfords not here
out playing golf right
still puzzled and unsure thats right
maybe hell finally break a hundred
maybe its better if you came back
interrupting thats alright
we dont mind waiting
pupkin walks from the foyer into the living room leaving jonno staring after him holding the bags
rita walks into the living room after pupkin
worried the tables only set for one
thats from breakfast
relax will you
jonno is on the phone
a black lady cook stands at his side
into the phone let me talk to jerry langford please i know he is
it is a handsomely furnished room done in old american antiques and other tasteful pieces
there is a grand piano heavy with pictures in one corner and wall to wall bookshelves that are mostly full and mixed with a balance of classics and modern popular
the whole room marks langford as a man of discernment
the shelves also house a fine stereo and a small discreet bar
rita and pupkin walk in like strangers in paradise awed by the obvious elegance and expense the room reflects
as though he owned it how do you like it
admiringly i could live here
smiling proudly its the only way to live
rita stands in the center of the room ill at ease while pupkin strolls about comfortably picking up an ashtray here a cigarette case there inspecting the artifacts for inscriptions
clues hints about langfords character and life
how come he isnt here
you heard the guy
hes out playing golf
didnt you tell him when wed get here
pupkin continues to move about the room fielding ritas suspicious inquiries effortlessly
we didnt have time to iron out the details
now just relax
were the first guests thats all
interrupting that jonno character hadnt even heard of us
a little irritated it probably slipped jerrys mind
he has better things to think about than what he tells his houseboy
its just not time way i expected it thats all
there is a pause
pupkin continues his investigation
he has moved to the grand piano in the rear of the room
what do we do now
pupkin is looking at a picture of an american gothic couple standing in front of a wood frame house
as he comments on the pictures the camera pans over them
they form a kind of slide show of langfords life
these are jerrys parents
his father runs the post office in wolverine thats in north dakota
pupkin then fixes on a picture of an eleven year old boy standing next to a puppet stage with a puppet obviously held by the boy staring at its master
this one was in newsweek
he started giving these puppet shows when he was still in grade school
we see a picture of a very young langford seated before a microphone with some celebrity
and this is from his quiz show in st
can you believe it
sure i can
that was the name of the show
we move to a picture of langford smiling at jack paar
and heres when he wrote for jack paar
he made a hundred and fifty a week and look at him now
another picture of langford with a group of women sitting in a studio
and this is his morning show
a picture of langford standing in a park with his two boys eleven and eight
and his kids
rita who has been only half listening has picked up a small beautifully enameled cigarette box
look at this
i love these kind of things
look at the work
ive got this thing about boxes
rita puts it down reluctantly picks it up then puts it down again
jonno is holding the phone waiting
the cook stands looking at him
im sorry to disturb you
rita has just finished fixing herself a drink
she takes a large sip and starts pacing around
pupkin is seated
how much longer are we gonna have to wait
i dont know
until he gets back
do we have to just sit here
he should be back pretty soon
doesnt he have any music or anything
lets get a little life into this place
its like a funeral parlor
she walks over to the stereo and opens the cupboard beneath it revealing rows and rows of records
this is more like it
she pulls out a record
come on rita
come on yourself
she puts the record on
frank sinatra starts singing they cant take that away from me
she takes a big sip of her drink puts it down and comes over to pupkin
how about a little spin handsome
pulling back here
rita snuggles into pupkin and starts dancing him around
he resists feebly
come on rupert
i came up here for a good time
pupkin gives in and starts dancing with her in the style of the s elbow out arm up box step
after a few moments pupkin closes his eyes
he has reached a moment of perfect bliss his dream girl in is arms
they dance silently as we hear sinatra singing
the way you wore your hat the way we danced till three the memory of all that oh no they cant take that away from me no
they cant take that away
the orchestra plays
you never could dance could you
how would you know
oh i danced with you a couple of times at the sigma u party
you were there with tommy winston
you didnt ask me
thats the one time i did ask you and you went with him anyway
well i couldnt go with you why not
be serious rupert
jonno stands a few feet from the kitchen door staring at rita and pupkin dancing in the living room an unbelieving anxious expression on his face
the music has stopped momentarily and pupkin and rita disengage
pupkin looks lovingly at rita
well its all ended happily and thats what counts
rita grows jumpy under his gaze
she looks around
i wonder what the rest of this place looks like
im sure its all very nice
gaily well theres only one way to find out
rita scampers over to the stairs and pauses on the first step
you coming or not
rita bounds up the stairs
camera follows pupkin up the stairs
there is no sign of rita
where are you
there is no answer
camera follows pupkin from room to room
they are all guest rooms neat pretty clean
come on rita
this isnt funny
finally pupkin opens the door to another room
it is clearly langfords bedroom with a few clothes strewn about and other signs of being lived in
rita lies on the bed
shocked what are you doing rita
i love it
all those millions of women out there dying to change places with me right now
we shouldnt be here
relax will you
let me have a little fun for christs sake
rita gets off the bed and runs into the john
look at this
its nicer than my whole apartment
pupkin enters the large beautifully done bathroom
rita examines her face in the mirror
urgently lets go rita
boy i really need some sun
rita this is jerrys
lay off will you rupert
but we have no right
rita picks up a can of shave cream and squirts a large dollop in pupkins face
we come in for a close up of pupkins face buried under shaving cream
that wasnt funny rita
rita hands him a towel
she looks around
now for something that smells nice
she swings open the cabinet with a flourish
the door swings open violently and the mirror shatters against something as pills and bottles tumble into the sink
pupkin and rita stand there staring at each other
rita begins to laugh but her laugh is cut short by the slam of the downstairs door
langford has entered drawn and businesslike
jonno and the cook have moved out to greet him
looking around where are they
i was going to call the police but then i thought to myself what if they are mr
we hear some whispers and scuffling at the top of the stairs
langford jonno and the cook look up
pupkin comes bounding down the stairs jauntily with rita following cautiously behind
pupkin has large traces of shaving cream behind his ears and on his neck
we were just freshening up
pupkin stops at the base of the stairs turns around and waves rita down
to rita come on rita
no need to be shy
pupkin smiles conspiratorially at langford
rita comes slowly down
jerry id like you to meet rita keane
rita say hello to jerry
tentatively pleased to meet you
langford nods imperceptibly his face tense his eyes alert
rita reading her frigid reception looks to pupkin who walks blithely past langford into the living room toward the bar
whats your pleasure
pupkin glances at the small mess he has left on the bar and turns back to langford who has moved into the living room with jonno and the cook a
few steps behind
pupkin flashes langford an apologetic smile
to langford weve already taken the liberty so to speak
rita was a little nervous
it isnt every day she meets someone like you
whats going on here
weve been sitting around waiting
how was your golf game
i told them you werent here
he did jerry
he was very helpful
we had to take an early train
there was nothing else until after one
pause i brought the material
its upstairs in my bags
pause where is everybody
the other guests
in a confidential tone were getting a little hungry to tell you the truth
as though confirming what pupkin said you are
backing off but we dont mind waiting do we rita
rita says nothing
she has sensed something terribly wrong and is slowly backing away from pupkin
you know i could have you arrested both of you
seizing the idea you know you could
and thered be absolutely no way we could prove we belonged here
i never thought of that
well you should have before you
still fixed on the idea maybe we could work up a routine about that about a guy who throws all his friends in jail
lets talk about that
sharply lets not sure jerry
exasperated look if youve got something for me to sign lets have it and get it over with so i can get back
interrupting that wouldnt be right jerry
not in your own house
summoning his last bit of patience i have a lot of work to get to
to jonno how did they get here
we took a taxi jerry
but dont worry about us
you go ahead and do your work and well just take a stroll around until lunch is ready
youre a little thick arent you
smiling as though complimented well maybe a
whats hes saying rupert is that he wants us out
dont listen to her jerry
she doesnt understand anything about us
dont get me into this
to jonno call the station
jonno goes back into the foyer followed by the cook
therell be a cab here in a few minutes
now if youll just wait at the gate
look jerry if ive said anything out of line lets chalk it up to inexperience okay
ill just go upstairs and get my tape and we can start working
it shouldnt take long and then youll have the rest of the afternoon to yourself
ive told you just as clearly as i can
i want you out of here and i want you out now
scram beat it vamoose out
is that plain enough
rita deftly pockets the enamel box
but what about my material
when are we going to go over it
come on rupert the man wants us to go
tell her shes wrong jerry
i didnt know anything about all this
i hardly know this guy
i havent seen him in years
so if theres anything i can do any way i can make this up to you
shes nothing jerry
shes just some girl who works in a bar
dont let her spoil things
langford starts herding rita and pupkin towards the door
all im asking is fifteen minutes
just long enough to listen to my act
is that asking too much fifteen minutes of your day against my whole life
ill call the police if i have to
langford realizes he is being hard
he stops for a moment
i have my own life thats all
but what about me jerry
what about my life
i made plans based on what you said
you cant just turn your back on me
im not telling you again
there is a long pause as the truth finally sinks in
pupkin just stares at langford with disbelief that turns to anger
so this is the way it works when youre big huh
you just play with people
is that part of the kick jerry
pause i can see i was all wrong about you
rita starts tugging at pupkin
come on rupert
to rita shut up
to langford you werent my friend at all were you
you were just playing some kind of game with me
well thats not going to stop me jerry
im just going to work a little bit harder thats all use a little bit more enterprise
and not count on anybody
thats where i made my mistake
i can see that now
pupkin picks up the pair of small suitcases
glaring at langford come on rita
were wasting our time
pupkin strides out with rita following
she casts langford an apologetic glance as she goes
the door slams behind them
they walk down the path silently for a few moments as the camera pulls up following them in an overhead shot
we hear them start talking as they make their way towards the gate
baffled and angry what did you think was going to happen
you think hed just
whats the matter with you
pause you cant just walk into a guys house
and what about me
what did you
interrupting in a calm but firm voice shut up rita
marsha sits at the wheel of this lavishly appointed sedan her face made up as though she were going to a fancy party
pupkin sits on the other side of the front seat
his ex pression has changed somewhat from the pupkin we have seen
he is less wide eyed less innocent tougher
whining how much longer
do you want him or not
there is a pause
you sure hes in there
with obvious delight my parents are going to be furious pupkin pulls a toy revolver from his jacket pocket and looks it over
marsha glances at it
it looks real
thats the whole point
gesturing with his head towards the entrance of the building which is some yards away pay attention
marsha looks towards the entrance
a few beats pass
what if he doesnt come down
but what if he doesnt
well come back tomorrow
and wait again
look youre going to have him all to yourself
what else do you want
a man resembling langford walks out the entrance
is that him
sure im sure
that looks too much like him
what do you mean
when its him it doesnt look like him
pupkin closes his eyes and rests for a moment
pupkins eyes snap open
we see langford concealed in his trench coat dark glasses and tightly pulled cap start walking east
what should i do
wait a second and follow him
langford is walking innocently towards his offices
the mercedes prowls a quarter of a block behind
what about here
langford continues walking
the street is practically empty
go past him and stop
we stay with langford as he walks
we see the mercedes pull past him
suddenly pupkin is in the frame walking side by side with langford
just keep walking or ill kill you right here
langford looks at pupkin in terror
he falters a bit out of fear
i said keep walking
this is a gun in my pocket and ive got nothing to lose
who keeps walking what do you want
just keep walking and dont talk to anybody
ill tell you what to do
a man coming the other way stops and stares at langford out of curiosity
pupkin and langford keep walking
they get to where the mercedes is waiting
pupkin jabs langford in the ribs with the gun
look this is
interrupting just shut up and get in
langford gets in the front seat
langford moves to the middle of the front seat
langford looks over and recognizes marsha
a close up records his reaction of sheer terror
we see langford get out of the mercedes which is parked in front of a fire hydrant
langford follows marsha into a brownstone
pupkin walks behind langford
pupkin langford and marsha enter
it is an absolutely stunning studio apartment furnished lavishly by marshas parents for their daughter in antique furniture suitable for a woman of fifty
marsha has imprinted her own stamp on the apartment in two ways first the place is abso lutely chaotic
secondly there are a number of blow up pictures on the wall
a picture of langford sits on the bureau
there is a big brass bed with an ornate brass frame at the foot
langford stares at marsha and pupkin
pupkin closes the blinds and turns on the lights
marsha trains the gun on langford
pupkin finishes his work and takes the gun back
i didnt like being so rough out there jerry
but i wanted you to know that i meant business
i didnt want anything happening to you over some misunderstanding
langford just stares at him frozen with fear
now i know youre wondering what this is all about
actually youve got nothing to worry about
you just do what i tell you and by say midnight youll be safe and out of here
of course if you try anything clever ill kill you or marsha will
she knows how to use this too
you realize what youre saying
come on jerry
this isnt a spur of the moment thing
give me a little credit will you
pupkin looks over to a small phone table with a chair next to it
he motions to it with his head
to langford sit down
langford docilely sits by the phone
now youre going to call your office and tell them this that unless a man who identifies himself as the king is allowed on the show tonight as the first
guest theyll never see you alive again
ill say it again
it is a large office in two pieces
a secretary sits in the smaller part next to the door of the larger section
her phone is ringing
hes in a meeting mr
thomas a young trim executive in his late thirties in modish dress sits at the table with several other people including cathy long
they are sipping coffee from con tainers
there are memos and lists and other papers on the table
the secretary stands at the doorway
thomas and the others are looking up at her
he says its urgent
well tell him ill call him back
to the others its that martino kid the impressionist
langford sits by the phone with pupkin a few steps away holding the gun and marsha looking on
langford looks desperate
then try again
an irked bert thomas wearily picks up the phone
okay martino lets stop the bullshit
okay im listening
we watch thomas expression as it turns from skepticism to concern bordering on alarm
give me that again
wait a minute
what do we call our second cameraman
the scene is as before only now langford is sweating a bit
into the phone helen keller
warning no tricks jerry
thomas is still at the phone
dont do anything jerry
stay right there
tell him well do anything he wants
tell him to cool it
are you okay
look tell him to call us about five okay
well let him know what to do
and dont do anything stupid
thomas puts down the phone
calls to his secretary vivien
thomas secretary appears at the doorway
get me the number of the f
and get me crocketts office
and keep your mouth shut about this
langford is standing awkwardly in the middle of the room wearing a sweater that matches the patch of cloth we saw in the envelope marsha gave pupkin
pupkin is still training his pistol on langford and marsha is appraising the fit
to pupkin what do you think
to langford i had to guess on the sleeves
to pupkin he gets to keep it doesnt he
sure if he isnt dead
thomas is on the phone
panicky know hes in a meeting and i dont care
ive got to talk to him
no he can not call me back
dont you understand
this is an emergency langford is seated on a chair whose back is pressed right up against the high ornate brass bedstead at the foot of the bed
marsha trains the gun on langford now
pupkin is unpacking a suitcase
he takes out a handsome blue suit ruffled shirt a bow tie black shoes underwear socks shaving equipment soap a hairbrush a clothesbrush a small shoe shine kit aftershave lotion
deodorant and a dozen or so rolls of inch and a half wide adhesive tape
he removes this stuff from a suitcase that is barely big enough to hold it so the mere packing of all this para phernalia into such a small space represents
something of an achievement
as he takes the stuff out he talks to langford his back turned to him
this wasnt an easy decision for me jerry believe me
for one thing i knew it meant we could never be friends again and that hurt me
its hard to lose a friend even one who has let you down
you always hope you can patch things up
you know a guy like me doesnt make friends that easily
pupkin pauses a moment then turns to langford his voice filled with emotion
why didnt you just listen to the tape when i asked you
then i wouldnt have to be doing all this
was it really too much to expect a few minutes of your time to listen to something id worked on my whole life
langfords eyes shift rapidly
he is obviously calculating how to deal with pupkin
with disarming charm hey if thats whats bothering you lets go over to my office and listen to that tape right now
are you crazy jerry
do you know what would happen to me
marsha listens to this exchange a bit nervously
gesturing to her gun she says am i going to have to hold this thing all day
pupkin sees she has lowered it practically to her side
to marsha just keep it on him
to langford you know jerry
friendship is a two way street
all that time i was worrying about you and your ratings and everything you couldnt have cared less about me
langford thinks rapidly for a beat or two
you know that
i was thoughtless
its just that when youre doing a big show its hard to tell who your friends really are
i was wrong
why dont we just shake hands and forget the whole thing
suspiciously thats easy to say jerry
but i mean it
ill tell them that the whole thing was a joke and then we can go to my office and listen to that tape
what do you say
langford rises with his hand extended toward pupkin
to langford sharply sit down
langford looks to pupkin
i said sit langford reluctantly sits down
to marsha whats the matter
you heard what he said
all of a sudden with a gun on him he wants to make up and be friends
and once hes out the door what happens then
what happens then jerry
you get to his office and they jump you thats what happens rupert
shes right jerry
not if i tell them not to
this is jerry rupert i give you my word
to marsha he gives me his word
and what else
come on rupert im sick of waiting
and what else jerry
come on rupert
my words good enough isnt it
pupkin stares at langford for a few beats
then he shakes his head sadly and says in a very quiet discouraged voice
to marsha keep the gun up pupkin comes over to langford with a few rolls of adhesive tape in his hand
im sorry to do it this way jerry but im no good at knots
just put your arms up and out okay
langford spreads his arms back against the brass bedstead
as pupkin goes to tape them langford tries to grab him but with sudden demonic force pupkin pins him against the bedstead
they are practically nose to nose
oh no jerry
none of that
now hold still
we are in the office of wilson crockett president of the national broadcasting network
crockett sits behind his desk facing a group which includes several other network patten and his assistant giardello
they are in the midst of debate
look i tell you the bureau is doing everything possible to locate mr
right now our men are out checking out every radical group in this city
theyre willing to sacrifice their leader in order to get their message across arent they
youve got to figure that this is a desperate outfit
i dont know who they are anymore than you do
but i do know ive got to stop them
otherwise what youre seeing here is just the first of a whole wave of these kinds of kidnappings
upset does this mean were not supposed to put him on
who am i addressing please
thats bert thomas
he produces the show
im only saying mr
thomas that we cant allow this to reach the public
when the kidnappers call in of course youre going to be cooperative
promise them anything they want
after all this king character is going to have to show up sooner or later
and once we get our hands on him hell tell us where mr
patten grinds his fist into his palm
we see pupkin in the shower shampooing
the scene is as before
let him go on if you have to
its just a taping
you can always erase him afterwards cant you
pause all im saying is this dont put him on the air
thats fine inspector but lets say he finishes his bit and youve worked him over
questioned him mr
there is light laughter
okay questioned him and he still wont talk
we get to eleven thirty and what do we do
do we air him or what
there is a heavy pause
i would say no
but they might kill jerry
breaking in okay burt
to patten thank you inspector
we appreciate your position and well do all we can to cooperate with you
but i have to tell you right now that if it comes down to it were not taking any chances with mr
i understand but
interrupting if your men havent been able to locate mr
langford by air time were going to have to put this king guy on no matter what hes said
after all inspector whats ten or fifteen minutes of talk show time against a mans life
we see pupkin in his new suit and ruffled shirt impeccably groomed standing next to the bed
he is talking to langford but we dont see anyone but pupkin
he is wrapping langfords mouth shut but all we see is that he is doing something
can you breathe
in and out
we pull back to see langford nodding
he is strapped to the bed with tape and encased like a mummy only his eyes and nose showing
pupkin has wrapped him in tape from tip to toe
marsha emerges from the kitchen stirring something
to marsha youve got until around midnight
have a good time
to langford so long jerry
wish me luck
the phone rings
bert thomas secretary answers
whos calling please
her voice grows tense yes mr
thomas sits by his phone
there is a large machine looking like a large tape recorder attached to the phone and monitoring the call
giardello is at a second phone and starts placing a call
patten stands next to thomas
there are two other plainclothesmen in the room crockett and cathy long
quietly to thomas keep him talking
thomas nods and picks up the phone
yes mr king
everythings been arranged
now if youll just tell me a little about the nature of your material so that we can
pupkin stands in a public phonebooth on a streetcorner
into the phone ill tell you everything you need to know at the studio this evening mr
i appreciate your co operation
pupkin steps out of the booth and starts walking downtown
marsha is setting the dining room table for two
she talks as she works
ive got so much to tell you i just dont know what to begin with
are you okay
langford mumbles incoherently through his gag and tape
tell me if youre not
i guess youre wondering why i do stuff like this
i think its because im a leo but my shrink says im pathologically rebellious and self destructive
you dont think im self destructive do you
langford mummified again mumbles and struggles a bit in his bonds
i knew you wouldnt
thats cause youre the only person in the world who really understands me
crockett sits behind his desk
with him are bert thomas cathy long and three other executives
can randall sub for jerry
tony randall is one of any number of substitute hosts
his agents calling us back but it looks good
i only told him jerrys sick
well if worse comes to worse canter can always carry it
to cathy long let me see your list
cathy long hands crockett a blue piece of paper
he glances over it quickly
any one of these a writer
pointing to a name on the list mccabe
the vanishing siberian tiger
what if we dont run this king guy
wholl fill the time
well stretch the other guests
but i think were going to wind up running him
for one thing weve got to think about jerry
and from a news point of view weve got a responsibility to air this story
pause i mean who would you rather watch some tiger expert or a live kidnapper
but nobodys going to know hes a kidnapper
theyll think weve gone crazy
then theyll read about it in the papers tomorrow and believe me tomorrow night everyone in america will be watching jerry talk about his experience
and he can put this king guy on rerun
youre going to put him on twice
what if his stuffs unusable
and remember what patten said about
pause we can always edit the guy
and as for a wave of these things i just dont buy the idea that there are that many people out there crazy enough to spend their lives in prison
for a few minutes on television
pupkin walks purposefully down the street
the street is quiet
suddenly three cars pull up and some dozen plainclothesmen get out
two wait outside the theater the ten others disappear inside through the backstage entrance
pupkin is now walking cross town towards the theater
a line of some people has gathered outside the theater
a sign at the bottom of the poster showing langford reads tonights guest host tony randall
from the pov of the stage we watch six plainclothesmen descend into the orchestra and take widely scattered aisle seats
when the last has taken his seat we
depending on the season it is either dusk or late afternoon
the ushers swing the doors open and the ticketholders file in
pupkin is crossing broadway a few blocks from the theater
at the center of the stage a pretty model used solely to test color quality sits in langfords chair as several members of the tactical patrol force admire her considerable
a number of technicians go about their work
cameramen move to and from their stations
four plainclothesmen are gathered behind the stage door
they watch zsa zsa gabor or some other sexy talk show celebrity enter and then return to talking among themselves
the situation appears normal
only the regular backstage door guard a big grey haired man stands at the door
nearby two other young men in colorless suits stand talking
we watch clarence mccabe a writer his plain wife and her parents arrive in front of the theater locate the backstage entrance and present themselves before the a bit pompously

cathy long passes by
she spots pupkin and walks swiftly over
what are you doing here mr
the lights are dimmed
music is playing on the phonograph
two candles burn on the elegantly set dinner table
marsha stands in the middle of the room in front of langford
she is singing
langford is still encased in tape

patten nods to thomas who takes the paper and reads it as he leaves
how about helping us mr

marsha has finished a half bottle of wine
she is eating a beautifully decorated piece of stuffed capon and talking through her tears
crying it was the second lead
id never gotten a part in my life and here i get the second lead
and what does daddy say
shot of langford still bound from tip to toe
not marsha thats wonderful or were proud of you or anything
he starts lecturing me on how i should have tried out for emily

marsha gets hold of herself
she swallows a couple of pills and swills them down with some wine
calmer my doctor says i shouldnt get excited
marsha picks at another piece of capon
this is the best i ever made it
you want some
langford the mummy nods
marsha picks up the plate across from her fills it with food and pulls a chair up next to langford
she undoes the tape around his mouth and picks a sock out of his mouth
marshas going to feed her jerry
two young girls are working on big cue cards copying from the piece of paper pupkin has given thomas
tony randall stands next to thomas
the two of them watch
randall is going over the lines
pupkin has obviously been worked over
he is sweating
how about it king
if im not on that show jerry langford is dead i promise you
patten nods to his plainclothesmen again who start working pupkin over
the beginning of the taping is seconds away
everyone is in his place
the stage manager is counting down from five on his fingers
at zero he points across to rick ross the orchestra leader who strikes up the familiar langford show theme song
four technical engineers are seated along a large console containing a multitude of small television screens
one screen shows the spotlight falling where randall will enter
another shows the logo of the langford show
another shows nothing in particular
behind the technicians stand crockett and the executives we have seen in the previous scenes
a technician is giving instructions to the cameraman
hold on two
come on keller
get it framed
the theme song is playing
bert canter stands off camera at one side of the stage before a microphone
direct from new york
its the jerry langford show with guest host tony randall and his special guests olympic swimmer mark spitz pundit gore vidal the one and only zsa zsa gabor and another
of jerrys taped exclusives an interview with prince ranier of monaco
as always rick ross and the orchestra and me bert canter
say hello to tony
an applause sign flashes like crazy
the audience cheers wildly
in the back we notice a handful of tactical patrolmen scattered about
randall strides on stage briskly accepting the cheers of the crowd with his arms raised
he nods and then his eyes fix on those hastily written outsized cue cards
he reads them with a mixture of professionalism and wry distance wanting to disown the words without seeming silly
good evening ladies and gentlemen
thank you very much
i have some sad news for you
earlier today my writing staff was executed in central park by the network firing squad so therell be no sensational randall monologue this evening
the audience cheers derisively
no embarrassing displays of emotion please
the audience laughs instead were going to do something a little bit different this evening a lot different if you ask me
were going to give you a glimpse into the future
it isnt often that you can call someone a sure thing in the entertainment business
after all the verdict is always in your hands
but i think tonight after youve met my first guest youll agree with me that hes destined for greatness in one way or another
so will you please give your warmest greeting to the newest king of comedy rupert pupkin
the music plays
the applause sign flashes
the audience applauds heartily and nobody appears to fill the spotlight at the edge of the wings
the spotlight holds for what seems like an eternity
pick up the audience
finally after what seems like an eternity pupkin emerges straightening his jacket a bit and trying to crane the kinks out of his neck
he is a bit tense but very high and in full command
as he delivers his monologue pupkin is more confident comfortable and self assured than we have ever seen him
good evening ladies and gentleman
let me introduce myself
my name is rupert pupkin
i was born in clifton new jersey which was not at that time a federal offense
laughter is there anyone here from clifton
we can all relax
now id like to begin by saying that my parents were too poor to afford me a childhood but the fact is nobody is allowed to be really poor in
once you fall below eleven thousand youre exiled to passaic
my parents did in fact put down the first two payments on my childhood
then they tried to return me to the hospital as defective
but like everyone else i grew up in large part thanks to my mother
if she was only here today id say hey mom
what are you doing here
youve been dead for nine years
laughter you should have seen my mother
she was wonderful blonde beautiful intelligent alcoholic
laughter we used to drink milk together after school
mine was homogenized
hers was loaded
laughter once she was picked up for speeding
they clocked her doing fifty in our garage
laughter when they tested her they found that her alcohol was two per cent blood
they took away her license and she died shortly afterwards
we used to joke together mom and me until the tears would stream down her face and shed throw up
laughter and who would clean it up
he was too busy down at ogradys throwing up on his own
in fact until i was sixteen i thought throwing up was a sign of maturity
while the other kids were off in the woods sneaking cigarettes i was hiding behind the house with my fingers down my throat
laughter i never got anywhere until one day my father caught me
just as he was giving me a final kick in the stomach for luck i managed to heave all over his new shoes
thats it i thought
ive made it
im finally a man
laughter as it turned out that was the only time my father ever paid any real attention to me
he was usually too busy out in the park playing ball with my sister rose
and today thanks to those many hours of practice my sister rose has grown into a fine man
laughter me i wasnt especially interested in athletics
the only exercise i ever got was when the other kids picked on me
they used to beat me up once a week usually tuesday
after a while the school worked it into the curriculum
and if you knocked me out you got extra credit
laughter except there was this one kid who was afraid of me
i kept telling him hit me
whats the matter with you
dont you want graduate
as for me i was the only kid in the history of the school to graduate in traction
the school nurse tucked my diploma into my sling
but my only real interest right from the beginning was show business
even as a young man i began at the very top collecting autographs
laughter dinner is over
marsha is sitting next to langford
as langford speaks it is obvious that he is turning on the charm for strategic reasons
that was a wonderful dinner marsha
i want you to know how much i enjoyed it
we can do it again
id like to show you my gratitude
but its a little difficult like this
langford indicates his bonds
in a tone of intimacy lets say i took all this off
what would you do to me
we break in on a great burst of laughter
pupkin is just finishing his monologue
a lot of you are probably wondering why jerry couldnt make it this evening
well hes tied up and im the one who tied him
laughter you think im joking but thats the only way i could break into show business by hijacking jerry langford
laughter im not kidding
right now jerry langford is strapped to a bedstead somewhere in the middle of this city
laughter go ahead
but the fact is
tomorrow youll know i wasnt kidding and youll think i was crazy
but i figured it this way better to be king for a night than schmuck for a lifetime
laughter good night ladies and gentlemen
god bless you
the audience applauds heartily
the music plays
and tony randall salutes pupkin with a wave of his hand
pupkin goes off stage after soaking up the applause
a group of plainclothesmen seize pupkin and march him briskly through the backstage corridor towards the backstage door
a handful of people are waiting among them the autograph hunters mae celeste and sidney
mae out of a reflex of thirty years immediately extends her autograph book towards pupkin then recognizing him immediately pulls it back
to pupkin who did you get
pupkin says nothing as he is hustled into a limousine
sidney and celeste look on
mae trails after pupkin and the plainclothesmen
to plainclothesman could i have a ride
the plainclothesman says nothing and starts getting in the limo
ive never been in one
the limo pulls away
pupkin stands among a crowd of plainclothesmen who have obviously been working him over
patten sits behind his desk
giardello is at his side
the clock on the wall reads
well start all over again
where is langford
you know were going to find him sooner or later
im trying to tell you inspector
you let me walk out of here right
and as soon as im seen my act on the show as soon as im sure theyve really put it on ill tell you where jerry is and youll get
him back safe and sound
then why dont you watch the show here with us
that way were all happy
to giardello what channel
we get that one in fine
so what do you say pupkin
look ill say it again
you let me go now
patten motions to the plainclothesmen wearily with his head
they drag pupkin off
patten looks up at the clock
marsha is frantically attempting to unwrap langford
with each pull of the tape langford yelps
there is a small tangle of unwrapped tape collecting around langfords feet and sticking to marshas clothes
watch my hair
im sorry baby
we hear the sound of tape ripping
pupkin is hustled before patten again
pupkin glances at the clock
ive got to get out of here
youre not going anywhere pupkin
now where is he
im telling you inspector if i dont see that show where i want to see it jerry langford is dead
my people have instructions to execute him unless they hear from me by midnight
patten glances apprehensively at giardello
just where is it you want to watch this show
langford is half unwrapped now
the place is covered with yard after yard of tape
marsha is working frantically to finish unwrapping langford who is helping now that his arms are free
not so fast
working frantically we havent all night baby
marsha rips the tape off langford
oh i love you baby
i love you so much
a limo drives down broadway followed by an unmarked car
patten and giardello sit up front with the driver
pupkin sits in the back between two plainclothesmen
the limo pulls up in front of the bar restaurant where rita works
patten turns around in the front seat to address pupkin
here we are pupkin
i dont know what this is all about but as soon as youve seen yourself youre going to talk to us or i promise you youll never see daylight again
ill need a couple of minutes inspector
after its over i want a couple of minutes
and ill need ten dollars
does anyone of you gentlemen have my wallet
dont push me pupkin
a condemned mans last request inspector
well ill tell you right away the answer is no pupkin
its not much of a ransom inspector
losing his temper look im drawing the line thats all
no ten dollars and thats it
emphatically no ten dollars
in mollifying tones sure
no ten dollars
and no jerry langford
there is a pause as patten stifles himself
come on its getting late inspector
exploding to one of his men go ahead
give him his goddamned ten dollars
give him twenty
i dont care
just get him out of here
one of the plainclothesmen in the back opens the door and pupkin and the other plainclothesman get out
the unmarked car has pulled up behind the limo and other plainclothesmen stand next to it
pupkin and the two plainclothesmen start walking the ten yards or so to the bar restaurant
pupkin marches in flanked by the plainclothesmen
the clock over the bar reads
rita looks up from talking with a customer and sees pupkin
she says nothing
she just looks at him
there are five customers at the bar
a working class couple in their late fifties are half stewed the man telling the woman that her friend maud isnt really her friend because she wants for a used
a few seats down two men in their mid forties in wind breakers are locked in an intense but inaudible conversation
and close to the television set which hangs over the far end of the bar sits a mousy man with glasses who looks like an accountant
he is sipping a beer his eyes fixed on the set where the cbs late movie is just showing its logo
pupkin marches up to the bar
urgently to rita turn on langford
im watching this rita keeps staring at pupkin
just turn it
i was here first mister
you cant just walk in like this
it isnt fair
rita glances at the man
pupkin cant wait
he vaults onto the bar and turns the set to the langford show just as on screen he walks from the wings onto the stage to the applause of the
perched atop the bar standing next to the image of himself pupkin looks down at rita a smile of pride and triumph on his face
pupkin walking onto television screens in various homes across america in a chic new york living room in a suburban bedroom in the parlor of an indiana farmhouse in a
kitchen where a couple is in the middle of a raging domestic quarrel in an otherwise dark bedroom where a couple is in the throes of lovemaking in a bar a station house in a television store window display
marsha has just removed her dress and stands in her bra and panties as langford unwraps the last tape from about his ankles
the room is swimming in tape like an enormous boa constrictor gone mad
marsha moves towards langford her arms open
langford frees his ankles of tape just in time to side step marsha and moves quickly to the dining room table where he grabs the gun
he trains it on her
marsha moves toward him
he pulls the trigger releasing a plastic pellet that hits marsha in the stomach stinging her
langford glances down in horror at the gun which he now realizes is a toy and looks up in horror to see marsha bigger than life bearing down on him
dont be afraid of marsha baby
the customers are watching the conclusion of pupkins monologue along with the plainclothesmen and pupkin
we come in a split second after a joke
the customers laugh with the exception of the mousy man who is waiting in bad humor for pupkins act to finish
the plainclothesmen laugh reluctantly
pupkin no longer standing on the bar but back down with the others watches with fascination
rita watches grimly occasionally glancing at pupkin
pupkin on tv but i figured it this way better to be king for a night than schmuck for a lifetime
audience and customers laugh good night ladies and gentlemen and god bless you
the television audience applauds and the customers applaud and cheer in good humor except for the mousy man
the half stewed man leans across his woman to yell at pupkin as the two friends in windbreakers congratulate pupkin at the same time
there is a brief moment of carnival excitement
hey thats pretty good
to pupkin schmuck for a lifetime
how do you think up all to the woman you know that stuff
who hes talkin about
half stewed woman its a trick thats what about your all
larry can do it brother
as good as him
what about him
is it over now
hes another one
hes funnier than larry
larry just makes a lot half stewed man of faces
getting a little angry i told you to shut up about mousy man my brother
to pupkin well if nobody she doesnt know nuthin
pupkin takes all this praise and excitement with a shy smile of satisfaction glancing at rita from time to time for her reaction
she merely stares at pupkin with a sad expression on her face
come on rita
dont spoil the party
to the customers drinks all around on me
in a loud voice to half what about the hundred and fifty
we never saw a penny outta your brother
thats because my brother is a family man not like phil
the argument between the half stewed man and his woman continues at the end of the bar
the two friends have resumed their intense conversation
to the two friends whatll you have
the mousy man has climbed up on the bar and has turned the tv back to the late movie
he sits enthralled by a scene of violence courtesy of tony curtis as the boston strangler
pupkin looks down the bar at the stewed couple to offer them drinks but they are lost in an argument over the relative merits of their brothers
pupkin turns to the plainclothesmen
i dont suppose youre allowed anything
to rita i guess nobodys in a celebrating mood
how about you
you want something
its getting time pupkin
in a second
in a sad serious voice to pupkin that was true wasnt it
about the kidnapping
pupkin nods and shrugs
now you can say you knew me
thats something anyway
come on pupkin
to rita in a quiet tender voice i guess ive got go
take care of yourself will you
and when youre bored you know when youre brushing your teeth or something give me a thought okay
the plainclothesmen lead pupkin out of the bar
the two friends are still buried in their intense private conversation
the plainclothesmen and pupkin walk past the half stewed couple
its okay to talk about my sister but we cant say nuthin about phil is that it
to pupkin shes just had one too many
the plainclothesmen lead pupkin onto the street
as they walk the few steps to the car the first plainclothesman turns to pupkin
i just dont get it pupkin
youre gonna spend eight years in the can minimum and for what
you threw it all away
vaguely well see
we close in on pupkin smiling
the stage manager is counting down
at zero he points to rick ross who launches the orchestra into the langford show theme song
bert canter standing stage right speaks into the mike
direct from new york
the jerry langford show starring jerrys special guest out on bail rupert pupkin the kidnapping king of comedy
the audience applauds mightily and the final credits roll
as they roll the music to the langford show continues and we watch a montage that shows pupkin progressively taping langford to the back of a brass bedstead on stage
as the two of them talk and laugh
by the end of the montage langford is once again mummified and pupkin having finished bows and smiles
we close on a freeze frame close up of pupkin in ecstasy
