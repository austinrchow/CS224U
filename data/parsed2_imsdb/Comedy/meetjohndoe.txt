bulletin office sidewalk
close up of a time worn plaque against the side of a building
it reads a free press for a free people
while we read this a pair of hands come in holding pneumatic chisel which immediately attacks the sign
as the lettering is being obliterated dissolve to close up a new plaque on which the lettering has been changed to a streamlined newspaper for a streamlined era
cut to int
bulletin outer office
full shot of a mid western newspaper office
shot at a door at which a sign painter works
he is painting henry connells name on the door
it opens and a flip office boy emerges
the painter has to wait until the door closes in order to resume his work
full shot of the outer office
the activity of the office seems to suddenly cease as all eyes are centered on the office boy
shotpanning with the office boywho has a small sheet of paper in his hand
he walks jauntily to a desk refers to his paper points his finger to a woman emits a short whistle through his teeth runs a finger across his throat and
jerks his thumb toward managing editors office
the woman stares starkly at him while her immediate neighbors look on with sympathy
the office boy now goes through the same procedure with several other people
all watch him terror written in their eyes
shot toward connells office door where painter works
it opens and three people emerge
two men and a girl
the girl is young and pretty
all three look dourful
the painter again has to wait for the door to shut before resuming his work
the two men exit
the girl suddenly stops
close shot of the girl
her name is ann mitchell
she stands thinking and then suddenly impulsively wheels around
camera pans with her as she returns to connells office door flings it open and disappears
the painter remains poised with his brush waiting for the door to swing back
there is a slight flash of resentment in his eyes
full shot connell is behind his desk on which is a tray of sandwiches and a glass of milk half gone
near him sits pop dwyer another veteran newspaperman
ann crosses to connells desk

her eyes widen as a fiendish idea strikes her
she flops down in front of her typewriter
muttering wants fireworks huh
she begins to pound furiously her jaw set
close up of ann
eyes flashing as she types
close up of joe watching her
the wild look in her eye and the unnatural speed of her typing causes him to stare dumbly at her
shot ann bangs away madly
finally she finishes
she whips the sheet out of the typewriter hands it to joe
as joe takes it ann begins to empty the drawers of her desk
close up of joe reading what ann has written

at first i was sore at the state administration because its on account of the slimy politics here we have all this unemployment
but in looking around it seems the whole worlds going to pot so in protest im going to commit suicide by jumping off the city hall roof
signed a disgusted american citizen john doe
joe pauses to absorb this
continues reading editors note
if you ask this column the wrong people are jumping off roofs
joe glances up toward ann in mild protest
hey ann this is the old fakeroo isnt it

look genius now look
suppose there was a john doeand he walked into this office
what would you do
find him a job and forget about the whole business i suppose

why this is good for at least a couple of months
you know what id do
between now and lets say christmas when hes gonna jump id run a daily yarn starting with his boyhood his schooling his first job
a wide eyed youngster facing a chaotic world
the problem of the average man of all the john does in the world
two shot ann and connell
despite himself hes interested in her recital
now then comes the drama
he meets discouragement
he finds the world has feet of clay
his ideals crumble
so what does he do
he decides to commit suicide in protest against the state of civilization
he thinks of the river
but no no he has a better idea
the city hall
because he wants to attract attention
he wants to get a few things off his chest and thats the only way he can get himself heard
full shot of the whole group
beany grins in admiration
connell has leaned back in his chair his eyes glued on so
so he writes me a letter and i dig him up
he pours out his soul to me and from now on we quote i protest by john doe
he protests against all the evils in the world the greed the lust the hate the fear all of mans inhumanity to man
arguments will start
should he commit suicide or should he not
people will write in pleading with him
john doe will remain adamant
on christmas eve hot or cold he goes
she finishes takes a deep breathawed and at the same time proud of her accomplishment
close shot of connell
he just stares at ann
after a pausequietly very pretty

shot as she speaks she gets the little document out of her bag hands it to connell who glares at her takes the paper and starts to read
ann leans over his shoulder
pop peers over his other shoulder

so you think this is worth a thousand dollars do you
very carelessly oh the chronicle would consider it dirt cheap
packs everything including a gun
flings paper on desk okay sister youve got yourself a deal

the one we pick has gotta be the typical average man
typical american that can keep his mouth shut
show me an american who can keep his mouth shut andill eat him

this is sourpuss
er excuse me
ththats all right
if you didnt call me sourpuss it wouldnt feel natural
laughing there are snickers from the background
well anyway ii guess nearly everybody in the neighborhood came except the delaneys
the delaneys live in a big house with an iron fence around it and they always keep their blinds drawn and we always figured that he was just an old
miser that sat back counting his money so why bother about inviting him
until grimes the milkman spoke up and he said say youve got the delaneys all wrong
and then he tells
us about how they cancelled their milk last week and how when he found a note in the bottle he got kinda curious like and he sorta peeked in under
the blinds and found the house empty
if you ask me he says theyre starving
old man delaney has been bringing his furniture over to my place at night one piece at a time and selling it
close shot of john
profoundly impressed by this
wider shot bert clears his throat
and well sir a half a dozen of us ran over there to fetch them and we got them to the meeting
what a reception they got
why everybody shook hands with them and made a fuss over them and well finally mr
delaney just sat right down and cried
he smiles embarrassed and john as well as the others clear their throats
and then we started to find out about a lot of other people
er you know grubbel for instance
of course you dont know grubbel but hes the man that everybody figured was the worst no account in the neighborhood because he was living like a hermit and nobodyd
have anything to do with him
er that is until murphy the postman told us the truth
why grubbel he says he lives out of garbage cans because he wont take charity
because itd ruin his self respect he says
just like you said on the radio mr
well sir about a dozen families got together and gave grubbel a job watering their lawns
isnt that wonderful
and then we found jobs for six other people and theyve all gone off relief
er and my boss mr
schwabacker made a job in his warehouse for old man delaney
and he gave you that five dollar raise
wasnt that swell

before you lose your head completely may i remind you that i picked you up out of the gutter and i can throw you right back there again
youve got a nerve accusing people of things
these gentlemen and i know whats the best for the john does of america regardless of what tramps like you think
get off that righteous horse of yours and come to your senses
youre the fake
we believe in what were doing
youre the one that was paid the thirty pieces of silver
have you forgotten that
well i havent
youre a fake john doe and i can prove it
youre the big hero thats supposed to jump off tall buildings and things
do you remember
what do you suppose your precious john does will say when they find out that you never had any intention of doing it
that you were being paid to say so
youre lucky if they dont run you out of the country
why with the newspapers and the radio stations that these gentlemen control we can kill the john doe movement deader than a doornail and well do it too the moment
you step out of line
now if you still want to go to that convention and shoot your trap off you go ahead and do it
full shot d

cynically well that certainly is a new low
i guess ive seen everything now
wider shot as johns lips curl up contemptuously and he steps up to the table
throwing his hat on the table you sit there back of your big cigars and think of deliberately killing an idea thats made millions of people a little bit happier
an idea thats brought thousands of them here from all over the country by bus and by freight in jallopies and on footso they could pass on to each other
their own simple little experiences
close up of ann
her eyes light up happily
why look im just a mug and i know it
but im beginning to understand a lot of things
why your types old as history
if you cant lay your dirty fingers on a decent idea and twist it and squeeze it and stuff it into your own pocket you slap it down
like dogs if you cant eat something you bury it
close up of john
his voice is pleading
why this is the one worthwhile thing thats come along
people are finally finding out that the guy next door isnt a bad egg
thats simple isnt it
and yet a thing like thats got a chance of spreading till it touches every last doggone human being in the worldand you talk about killing it
full shot they listen to himunmoved
why when this fire dies down whats going to be left
more misery more hunger and more hate
and whats to prevent that from starting all over again
nobody knows the answer to that one and certainly not you with those slimy bolloxed up theories youve got
the john doe idea may be the answer though
it may be the one thing capable of saving this cockeyed world
yet you sit back there on your fat hulks and tell me youll kill it if you cant use it
well you go ahead and try
you couldnt do it in a million years with all your radio stations and all your power
because its bigger than whether im a fake
its bigger than your ambitions
and its bigger than all the bracelets and fur coats in the world
