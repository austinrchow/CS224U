written by jeff zuber tom zuber draft the room is dark and messy
jerry a soft unshaven boy of about eighteen years sits on the end of his bed in boxers and an old t shirt
he has not quite woken up yet
jerry pulls a huge well traveled suitcase from his closet and tosses it onto the bed
he begins grabbing articles of clothing from the closet and tossing them into the suitcase
jerry is in his kitchen which is no brighter than his bedroom and not much cleaner
jerry takes another bite of his peanut butter and jelly sandwich
he chews mechanically washing it down with a can of soda
his lazy mind is somewhere else
jerry gargles with a generic brand of mouthwash and spits into the sink
he catches a glimpse of himself in the medicine cabinet mirror he is not very attractive
he grabs his toothbrush and razor and exits the bathroom
the room has been stripped except for the bed minus its bedsheets a naked pillow a beat up dresser with a small tv on top of it an old pogo
stick propped against the wall near the garbage can at the foot of the bed and a few posters and scraps of trash
jerry tosses his toothbrush and razor into his suitcase next to a video game console and several video games on top of which lies grand theft auto iii
he has pitifully few belongings
he shuts the suitcase
the living room is also a mess the place is either a pig sty or a house full of bachelors
jerry now in sweatpants and sneakers but still wearing the same t shirt that he slept in carries his suitcase through the foyer to the front door
he about faces to look at the interior of his home
he will not miss it
he turns to open the screen door its stuck
he fiddles with handle until the screen door opens
he exits letting the screen door slam shut behind him
little athens the old building is badly in need of a fresh paint job
a faded sign reading athens rescue squad stands in front
you hear about your ex
the kitchen is empty except for heather and allison both about nineteen and dressed in ems uniforms with ems stitched conspicuously on the back seated on opposite sides of a
heather is dark haired about and built like a lingerie model
allison has blond hair is several inches shorter than heather and although not overweight she has a softer build than heather
heather has take out pancakes and sausages in front of her and she is putting it away like she is preparing for famine
allison has a bagel and a peach which remain hardly touched she has a lot on her mind
yeah asshole jerry
hes moving to middletown
he left this morning
how do you know
he got some job at some company giving his uncle hand jobs
having put away the last of her food heather lights a cigarette and stands near the open window careful to blow the smoke out the window
doesnt sound so bad
i got us tickets to see adam tomorrow
i dont want to go to a baseball game
youre going with derek anyway
ally i dont want to go either but derek told adam hed go and im not going by myself

heather takes a drag of her cigarette and exhales out the window
brad in jeans with his t shirt thrown over his shoulder is standing in front of the door waiting
megan in shorts a t shirt and a baseball cap and amy in a sunskirt look on
all in their late teens they are unmade and worn out as if they hadnt slept last night
brad rings the doorbell twice and waits some more
brad walks over to the window a few feet over from the door trying to peer through the shades
megan passes the time by pulling jimmys mail out of the mailbox that hangs next to the door
banging on the window pane hey
the door opens and jimmy answers in his very late teens about and thin dressed in boxers a t shirt and bedroom slippers
jimmys tired but brads a friendly face
office hours are nine to five

holding his hand out for the mail i know
megan hands jimmy the mail

jimmy stands aside allowing megan and amy into his apartment
megan and amy step inside but brad holds back
he needs to talk to jimmy and the girls do not need to hear

brad steps past jimmy into the apartment and jimmy shuts the door after them
the slender white board extends majestically over the glistening blue water
pedro an unshowered pot bellied hispanic about twenty three years of age and wearing cut off jean shorts is standing at the end of the board looking down at the
water below as if expecting an invitation
corey a late teenager covered with tattoos with twigs for arms and legs lies against the hard concrete while inserting the pool vacuum hose into one of the many pool
pedro begins to bounce on the board up down up down
pedro launches forth as if the water called out to him and but for his want of grace the entry would be poetic
instead pedros dive is as clumsy as it is painful
fuck you conjo
this is my shower
maybe back in mexico thats a shower in athens thats just dirty
clean the pool conjo clean the pool
at least im paid to be here
pedro smiles as he paddles away from corey starting to enjoy his morning swim
a payphone hanging on the pool house starts ringing
corey drops the vacuum and runs toward the payphone
in the background a number of enormous sand filters groan loudly
wynwood pool house corey speaking
emily the voice on the other end is hushed and uncertain
some other girl would be calling you
howd you get this number
dont you work there
what do you want
i need you to come pick me up

i need to stay with you for a couple days
emily our place is tiny we got no water

i wouldnt ask except i dont have anywhere to go
if you wanna stay in our little dump fine
jessica about eighteen wire thin and plain yet attractive in an unkept sort of way with dirty blond hair past her shoulders lies on a couch sleeping
her chokingly small living room is in a devastating state of disarray with clothes and empty food containers flung in every direction
an alarm on a table next to the couch begins blaring and jessica stretches out her arm to silence it
jessica is standing in front of the mirror staring at herself still half asleep
the bathroom is tiny like the living room pathetic rather than endearing
she puts toothpaste on her toothbrush
jina jessicas mother opens the front door and enters the living room wearing a grocery checkout clerks uniform
jina drops her old worn out purse onto the coffee table and enters the hallway
she opens the bathroom door and enters
jessica is brushing her teeth when jina enters
arent you supposed to be watching katie right now
jina reaches around jessica and opens the medicine cabinet grabs a bottle of aspirin and shuts it
jessica continues brushing as if her mother were not there
did you get my message
jessica shakes her head in the negative sense
jina exits the bathroom and jessica follows still brushing her teeth
jessica walks over to the answering machine and hits a button
the answering machine clicks on as jessica brushes unenthusiastically
electronic voice you have one new message
jinas voice hi jess its your mother calling to say happy birthday since youll be gone when i get home
im driving your sister to school and im leaving the car for her so ill be taking the train back
jessica starts up as if shed been struck
she spins around to an open window near the couch leans out and spits out the toothpaste to the concrete sidewalk below
her mothers voice continues to pour forth from the answering machine
by the way you should call your sister and stop this not talking nonsense
jessica finishes spitting the suds from her mouth and spins back towards the answering machine
anyway i know how you hate long messages so ill see you tomorrow
suddenly wide awake jessica turns to her mother
thats fucking bullshit
here we go again
what about my car
jessica your sister got into beauty school and shes going
now ive got about two hours sleep before i have to drive her all the way the hell up there
yeah i heard that
jess youre still living here for free
on the couch
jessica its still my car and she needs it
cant you be happy for your sister
oh yeah im real happy
she gets my car and i get shit
do me a favor and tell her how fucking happy i am for her
if youre going to be like this im just going to bed
jessica storms back into the bathroom and rinses her mouth out with water
jessica returns to the living room wearing a t shirt that reads athens youth group in large letters along the front
jina is gone
jessica runs her hand through her hair tossing it haphazardly
she grabs a pair of large sunglasses off of the coffee table and places them over her eyes
she opens the door and exits the apartment
jimmys piece of shit hatchback is parked in front of the small bare bones gym
jimmy now dressed in worn out heavily frayed khaki shorts and a short sleeve button down shirt with a rons gym emblem on the pocket stands before his locker twisting
the combination lock with one hand while rotating steel chinese stress balls with his other hand
he opens the locker and pulls out a large brown lunch bag propped prominently at the base
you fix the lat machine
ron the tall well built forty something owner of the gym approaches
jimmy turns toward ron
the row of lockers serves as a backdrop
jimmy im just gonna say this alright
i gotta let you go
i cant afford two employees
so youre keeping melinda
ron that is totally fucked
i been here way longer than her
yeah but im running a business
therere guys who pay me dues just cause she works here
but she doesnt do anything
she just sits at the front desk all day
i know that
tell her to fix the fucking lat machine shell look at you cross eyed
i cant afford two employees and she attracts business
jimmy dont take it personal
if you were built like her id keep you
ron exits and jimmy sits on the bench in front of his locker defeated
buggerin bobby bales a
bobby the bookie an enormous juicehead built like an old school nfl linebacker naked except for a towel around his neck having just taken a shower is leaning against the
end of a row of lockers waiting for his chance at jimmy
jimmy would rather that ron stay
bobby nods in response as ron passes by on his way out
with the locker room empty bobby unconsciously changes demeanor
hes tender frighteningly tender its so entirely genuine
jimmy would prefer a beating simple and final
jimmy pulls his backpack out of his locker and begins clearing his stuff
so where you been
what are you talkin about
i been working
so you just dont return my phone calls
look they lost i owe you some more so what
ill pay you
i want to put it on indy tonight
i cant take any more of your bets
i look like a spineless fucking fag
bobby shuts jimmys locker and steps up to jimmy so that jimmy is now face to face with bobbys enormous organ a terrifying sight for mortal men and reputable women
jimmy is struck silent savagely clenching his chinese stress balls as he struggles for thought
what the hell am i supposed to do with you jimmy
people are talkin
i know theyre talkin
you dont know a fuckin thing
come by my apartment tonight well figure this out
i aint like that
aint like what
you dont know what i know
im working tonight
jimmy i aint about beggin

im gettin sick of it
bobby moves on to his own locker
wide across the width of the pool
corey wet with goggles on his head holding a wrench and screw driver and bystander stand over a young twenty ish female victim who lies passed out on the cement
a young female lifeguard is kneeling beside the victim checking her pulse and breathing
the two swimmers left in the pool are climbing out
pete a no nonsense grounds keeper in his late thirties wearing cut off shorts a faded t shirt and a tool belt approaches to have a word with corey
is she alright
alright im calling
everybody stay out of the pool
the lifeguard stands and runs off toward the payphone
alright well quit horsing around
the blandinos had a break in
theres glass all over the patio
thats jerrys unit
jerry moved to middletown
he left a message
you gotta take care of all his stuff now too
aw come on pete
i need off tomorrow
i told you i got community service
so youre gonna have to get everything done today then
corey tears the goggles off his head throws them into the pool and about faces toward the pool house
as corey leaves a red headed idiot does a sloppy can opener off the side of the pool
keith i told you to clear the pool
though the park is in a poor neighborhood it is relatively clean
the park is quiet and unused this morning except for two young girls making their way across it
prominent in the background sits an old run down yellow car that jessica drove to the park
jessica is carrying katie a plain tiny seven year old girl in piggy back fashion with katies legs dangling out in front of jessica
katie holds jessica tight around the collarbone
doesnt carlos want his car back
hes letting me borrow it
well then why were you late if you had his car
i slept late
were you drinking last night
but thanks for asking
were you doing drugs
katie i told you drugs are for losers
and youre not a loser
and neither are you
but its okay to drink
when youre older itll be okay
how old are you
but youre not twenty one yet
the law says you have to be twenty one
katie can you not ask so many questions today
ive got too much to think about
cause its your birthday
jessica begins walking faster soon breaking into a crippled run the weight of katie bearing down on her
they reach their destination a rickety old merry go round
jessica turns her back to the merry go round allowing katie to step onto it
hold on tight or youll get hurt
katie grabs a handle as jessica begins to spin the machine
katie sails around happily as jessica steps back to watch katies youthful enthusiasm lulling jessica into a nostalgic gloom
heather is driving the ambulance sirens blaring a cigarette hanging out of her mouth with allison riding shotgun
harry mild mannered rotund middle aged and slightly balding is in the back sitting on a bench extending from the side of the ambulance adjacent to a stretcher
harry sits expressionless adjusting his spectacles as the ambulance shakes mildly from the driving
pointing turn left at the light
wide on the ambulance tearing through town lights flashing
heather is driving extremely fast in this emergency situation recklessly passing both moving vehicles as well as stationary vehicles that have stopped to let the ambulance pass on her way
to running through a red light
in the rear of the ambulance harry whips back and forth on the bench yet remains calm as if unaware of heathers reckless driving
within the parking lot the ambulance comes to a screeching halt in front of a large picket fence encircling the pool
at the gate stands the lifeguard
all three climb out of the ambulance
harry rushes toward the lifeguard
heather takes a final puff of her cigarette and flicks it aside before continuing in the same direction as harry
allison lags behind pulling a backboard and a large first aid kit out of the ambulance
shes in here
they enter the gate
heather and harry follow the lifeguard into the pool area where several bystanders have gathered around the victim bystander and pete among them
heather gets to the victim first but stops short she recognizes the victim
harry brushes past heather
to bystanders can you give us some room please
the crowd backs up a bit and harry checks for vitals
looking up to heather shes breathing
harry looks the victim over a bit
to lifeguard what happened
im not sure
she just passed out right where you see her
did you see her eat anything
heather turns and walks back toward allison coming through the gate carrying the backboard and first aid kit she wants a word with allison
they talk in hushed tones
i know her
allison hands heather the first aid kit as they move back toward harry
when i was dating steve that slut fucked him
how do you know
she started dating steve right after we broke up
i mean right after
i asked him if there was another girl and he never answered
he couldnt answer because he was fucking that slut
that doesnt mean they fucked
heather gives allison a disapproving look as if to say dont be stupid stupid
as heather and allison approach the victim harry looks up
alright she aint comin around
allison lays the backboard adjacent to the victim and the three place her on the backboard
heather is a bit rough
instinctively whoa easy
without looking up i know what im doing
harry gives a concerned look to allison who returns the look but the two say nothing
they place the victim into the back of the ambulance as heather looks on
the ambulance is moving along a near empty single lane road at a patient pace with two cars tailgating behind it
allison and harry are in the back with the victim and heather is again behind the wheel moving her head ever so slightly as if to music playing in her
heathers moderate driving speed is in sharp contrast to the speed with which she responded to the scene
at the same red light that heather recklessly ran earlier heather stops and looks in all directions before proceeding even though there are no cars at the intersection
uh heather you want to step on it
well get there
you dont even know for sure if she slept with steve
heather turns around in the driver seat taking her eyes off the road
listen fuck that slut okay
she can fucking rot in hell
im not rushing for her slut ass
pleading heather cmon shes out cold
we gotta hurry
i dont fucking care
that slut can kiss my ass
to victim you hear me you fucking bitch
as heather spins forward to look at the road the ambulance jumps as it hits a pothole
the tow truck has just pulled up into the driveway
pedro climbs out and makes his way up the sidewalk to his front door carrying a gallon of milk
emily climbs out and trails behind him carrying her laundry bag and purse
the house is very small with a front yard that is not much bigger than the sidewalk and neighboring houses not much more than a body length apart from each
pedro notices an eviction notice on the front door and that a brand new lock has been placed on the otherwise run down door
he tries unsuccessfully to open the door
he walks over and looks through the front window into his kitchen and sees his dog
pedro taps on the window
the dog looks up at pedro wagging its tail
pedro tries to open the window but its locked
pedro walks around to the side of the house
emily throws her laundry bag over her shoulder and follows him frustrated with the wait
he looks in the window on the pantry door
he backs up and looks toward emily blank
he looks back up at the house frustrated
he about faces steps over to the side of the neighboring house unzips his pants looks both ways to make sure the neighbors are not around and starts pissing
emily shakes her head and heads back toward the truck turned off by the whole situation
jimmy parks his piece of shit in front of a mom and pop pizza shop and exits
a sign that reads poppys pizzeria hangs above the pizza shop
jimmy walks past a few tables where patrons are eating
pizza pop a sixty ish pot bellied man standing behind the counter making a pizza sees him
heavy italian accent hey a jimmy you dont hafta be here till

in an arched entranceway to the back room we see pizza mom back into view holding several pizza boxes in insulated carrying bags
smiling hey a jimmy
jessica is driving the old run down yellow car we saw earlier in the parking lot of the park the window down and the radio blasting
her cell phone rings and she picks it up
where the hell are you
carlos a skinny hispanic teenager is walking out of the convenience store with a tray of nachos talking on a cell phone
we cut back and forth between jessica and carlos

the old run down yellow car passes carlos and continues down the street
carlos is dumbfounded
what the hell
carlos runs into the street and stands staring down the road at his car speeding away from him
whats the matter
jess you just passed me
in my car
carlos continues to look as his car makes a right turn and disappears from view
jess this is bullshit
bring back my car
a horn honks and carlos steps toward the side of the road as a station wagon passes right by him
he continues to stand in the street although to the side
jess i know youre coming back here
i know youre not leaving me standing here
carlos waits impatiently
jessica pulls up in the car and comes to a stop alongside him she had gone around the block to pick him up
he gets in the passenger side door
the car pulls away
carlos has a look of disgust on his face
i would have brought the car back but i need it
so you ask
i said im sorry
and why the hell are you still driving
the car stops carlos and jessica climb out of the car and pass in back of it without a word
carlos climbs into the driver seat and jessica the passenger seat
jessica grabs carloss nachos and starts munching them down dipping each one into the cheese sauce that is on the side
wheres the squirt
at my place watching tv
you left her alone
just for a minute
i left my novel at aarons

arent you supposed to be watching her
yeah im stuck with her all weekend
im just gonna get through these last few weeks like i promised and im done i did a good thing and some other moron can take a turn being her
dont know why you wanted another sister when you hate the one you got
jessica needs to change the subject
whatre you up to
guess who stopped by
gigantic beast of a woman that she is
jessica is obviously delighting in this
she enjoys carlos fighting off the affections of this very unattractive girl
aw carlos i think you should give her a shot
shes probably one of those personality girls
yeah what you know about personality
i bet shell give it up right away
now thats something you know about
you should go for it
drain them pipes
fuck you fuck you fuck you
carlos reaches down and blasts the radio as the car speeds down the road
jimmy is carrying several full insulated pizza carrying bags with several brown lunch bags full of food on top
although the pile looks unwieldy jimmy has no trouble with it
he places the pile on the roof of his piece of shit opens the passenger door and places the pile on the passenger seat
he closes the door and pulls a delivery list out of his pocket to examine while walking around to the drivers side
jimmy gets into the drivers seat and pulls out his cell phone
into his cell phone hey car its me
i got a delivery in the area so im stopping by a little early
see you in a little while
jimmy hangs up starts his piece of shit and pulls out of the parking lot
a police car is sitting off the road positioned to surprise unsuspecting speeders
the lone occupant derek twenty about tall with athletic build in his police officer uniform is reading the sports section of a newspaper
ots on derek as he turns the page and continues reading the sports section
a young preppy high school punk speeds by in a corvette the radar gun reads m
as he passes the punk looks straight at derek mouth open clearly surprised by dereks presence
derek picks up his head and returns the stare of the surprised punk as he passes
returning to the sports section slow down there buddy
dereks cell phone rings
he reaches down fumbles around and brings it to his ear
allison is seated on a small wooden bench in the yard in front of the rescue squad
heather is pacing back and forth in front of her cell phone to her ear
both are smoking cigarettes
heather is still heated from seeing steves girl and allison is uncomfortable being around heather who may lash out at anything
we cut back and forth between derek and heather
are you seeing anybody else
are you seeing anybody else
youre not cheating on me
youre startin to annoy me
youre fucking annoying me

then calm down
you told me to tell you when youre in one of your moods

derek hears a click hangs up puts his cell phone down and goes back to reading the sports section
that assholes cheating

ally hes a cheater
thats what he does he cheats
now its my turn just like all the others
heather grabs her purse off the bench replaces her cell phone and pulls out her keys
allison gets up and follows heather toward the parking lot
carlos has parked in front of an old house which is in a high state of disrepair
jessica gets out of the car with carlos nachos

jessica shuts the door
as she walks away carlos cannot take his eyes off of her he is obsessed
jessica walks up the steps and bangs on the screen door
pitt african american medium build in his late teens with thick framed glasses walks up behind the screen door and holds it open for jessica to walk in
no he went to yer place lookin fer you
jessica walks in
pitt lets the door slam shut

pedro bangs on a stall door with no response
pedro pushes the door to the stall open
voy a cagar
pedro disappears behind the door of the stall
corey leans his mop against the wall and exits
jimmy pulls his piece of shit into the driveway of what appears to be a one story house next to a range rover
he climbs out with the strap of his backpack hanging over one shoulder and walks around the house to the back yard
the yard slopes significantly from the front yard to the back yard and the view of the back of the house reveals two stories
as jimmy turns the corner he spots a black cat walking up to him
he grabs the cat
wide on jimmy holding the cat behind a set of sliding glass doors one door partially open
he enters and shuts the door behind him
music is playing through stereo speakers and a black and white movie is playing on the tv with the sound shut off
car an asian american late twenty something is sitting back on the couch facing the tv
magazines junk food remote controls and a cordless phone are spread out on the coffee table
if car notices jimmy enter the room he shows no sign of it
saw your cat outside
jimmy tosses the cat on the floor and it scurries off to another part of the house
jimmy sits in a recliner beside the couch glad to take a load off
jimmy takes a peak at the tv
i gotta get back to work
i got more pies in the car
the cordless phone starts ringing
car remains perfectly still
the cordless phone continues to ring
jimmy leans over from his chair and waves a hand in front of car
jimmy jumps up from his recliner
he stares at car
he steps over takes two fingers and checks cars pulse
he stands back unsure of what to do
hesitant jimmy walks over to a closet opens the door and slides a gym bag out into the room
he opens the gym bag and pulls out a large bag of marijuana and a few jars of k
he throws them into his backpack zips up the gym bag and puts it back into the closet
jimmy exits through the sliding glass doors
jimmy shuts the doors behind him
he stops in his tracks just outside the doors thoughts running through his mind
wide on jimmy through the doors as he about faces and stares into the house
he slides the doors open and re enters
he picks up the gym bag and carries it to the front of the couch
he sets down gym bag and drops to his knees all while noticing that car appears to be staring at him
he unloads the remaining contents of the gym bag into his backpack including a few bags of pills a few more jars of k and two large bags of white
he throws one strap of his backpack over his shoulder and stands in front of car
jimmy stares at car
wide on jimmy as he throws his backpack into his trunk climbs into his piece of shit and sits reflecting
jimmy is driving through semi busy traffic
music is blaring from the radio and the driver side window is open making the noise in the cockpit quite loud
jimmys left hand is simultaneously wrapped around the steering wheel and the delivery list which is hanging down over the steering wheel so that he can read it
jimmys cell phone rings
over the wind and music yeah its jimmy
barely audible hey jimmy its matt

jimmy turns off the radio and begins rolling up the driver side window
speak up man i can barely hear you
matt in his late teens has a very short buzz cut
hes wearing an old t shirt and faded cargo shorts and hes sitting up on the edge of his unmade bed
matts bedroom is a shithole with dirty clothes piled everywhere
hes talking into a cordless phone using his free hand to rub the back of his neck nervously

jimmy hangs up and begins to roll down the window
the cell phone begins ringing again
jimmy reverses himself and begins rolling the window back up
yeah its jimmy
we cut back and forth between jimmy and matt
matt is now pacing back and forth in his shithole room
his voice is hushed although the sense of urgency in it is obvious
jimmys still talking loud as his piece of shit does not provide a quiet ride

jimmys eyes get very wide
jimmy slams on the breaks and cuts the wheel to the left
jimmy rocks forward as the stress balls that were sitting on the passenger seat fly to the floor
jimmys piece of shit has just rear ended another car of equal value parked in front of a stop sign in an otherwise empty intersection
the driver of the forward car stirs
jimmy has his right arm draped over the pizza boxes in the passenger seat protecting them from flying forward as a parent would have instinctively reached to hold back a
his cell phone starts ringing again
he slowly begins to stir
the driver dave a large ripped soft spoken juicehead gets out of the forward car holding the back of his neck
he slams the door shut with his free hand pissed and staggers towards jimmys car
a twenty something female passenger is sitting motionless in the passenger seat
dave glances up and sees jimmy
still dazed but immediately friendly hey whats up man
jimmy turns off the ringer on his cell phone and gets out of his vehicle

the window is completely open
the female passenger lies motionless bleeding noticeably from the forehead

emily is seated on a swing off to the side of the gated pool area smoking a cigarette looking in through the gate at the pool
shes wearing an old yet barely worn baseball cap

corey heads toward the gate and spots kevin a young boy of about ten sitting on the moped that was leaning up along the interior of the pool area fence
hey kevin get off my bike alright
its a moped

kevin gets off
corey continues toward the gate
the driver side door of a tow truck is swung wide open with athens towing service written on side
pedro is leaning one hand on the rolled down window and his other hand on the roof of the tow truck watching corey who is leaning over the tow trucks
hood writing mr
carsons address on a piece of paper with a pen
pedro throws the paper and pen into the tow truck
oye dont get mad but would you be mad if i try to fuck your sister
if you think you can
maybe you think you can talk to her for me
pedro shes fifteen

forming breasts with his hands no con esas tetas
ill have you sent to jail man

pedro climbs behind the wheel as corey holds the door open to talk to him
so whatre you gonna do

corey steps aside as pedro shuts his door and turns the ignition
wait a second
why are you still driving this thing
i thought you got fired
si si but i need it
how am i gonna drive without my truck
they fired me mehn
corey watches as pedro pulls out
establishing shot on the police station with a number of police cars parked neatly in front
two middle age male police officers are standing in front of the entrance talking
heather and allisons ambulance is parked in the lot across the street facing the police station
the engine is off
heather is behind the wheel and allison is slouched back on the passenger seat both watching the two male police officers standing in front of the building
i hate this job
i should pick up one of them assholes
dont you have an appointment with dr
five thirty and im not missing it
derek probably thinks youre sleeping with your doctor
theres nothing wrong with you
holding the lower portion of her right ribcage ally i have a pain right here that has nothing to do with my head
my dad died of heart disease and if that asshole taught me anything its better to be paranoid than dead
a female police officer a prim and proper plain jane woman in her early twenties exits the building and walks over to talk with the two male police officers
youre just guessing
ally i know thats her
thats his type too
that little slut
both heathers and allisons beepers go off
they both look down at their beepers and sit up in their seats
sorry if i snapped
you didnt snap
i mean this morning
heather starts the ambulance and starts to pull out of the lot
im just afraid its gonna be the whole thing all over again with derek and then ive got to find some other asshole and do it all again
im sick of the whole cycle
so do something different
im trying but hes fucking it all up
as they pull out of the lot the two male police officers head toward their police cars and the female police officer heads back inside the station
jessica is on a phone holding a bookmarked trash novel in her hand
pitt is sitting on the couch watching tv
yeah where are you
right down the street gettin some more nachos
can you just come back and get me
jessica looks up to see troy entering the house with aaron behind him
troy is a shaggy pothead slacker in his late teens wearing beat up jeans a t shirt with a faded logo on it and light hair above his lip and
on his chin
aaron a burly mutt about the same age and only slightly shorter wearing cut off cargo pants with one of the thigh pockets ripped off a sleeveless shirt and a
tattoo on his left shoulder
troy notices jessica immediately
aaron i dont know how the hell you got
interrupting fucking bitch
aaron shoves troy roughly out of the way as jessica bolts out of the room
to jessica use the back door yo
jessica runs out the back door and around the front of the house
aaron sees her turn the corner of the house and he turns around to cut her off
to pitt man dont be helpin that bitch
i dont want to see you be hittin no girl
just calm your ass down
aaron runs out the front door after jessica
hes gonna kill her
aaron is out the front door yelling at jessica who is further down the street
where you goin bitch
jessica runs to carloss car opens the door throws the novel in and jumps in after it
she throws on her seatbelt and rifles through her purse looking for her pepper spray
starting the car whats the deal
aaron holding a rock slightly bigger than his fist smashes the passenger side window
what the fuck
aaron reaches in and grabs jessicas hair and begins to rip her out of the car cutting his own arm while doing so
aaron growls more in anger than pain as he yanks with all his might
jessica is holding onto the inside of the passenger door with one hand and is scratching and clawing at aaron to get aaron to release her with her other hand
jessicas seat belt clearly is the only thing keeping her in the car
carlos is pulling away slowly
aaron releases one hand from jessicas hair and punches at the top of her head
fuck you you filthy fuckin whore
aaron repeatedly tries to hit jessica with his free hand as carlos pulls into the street
aaron runs along with the car
jessica reaches toward aaron with a closed fist where she is holding her pepper spray
she sprays at aaron but misses
aaron grabs at her fist with his free hand and rips the pepper spray from jessica
jessica screams in pain as aaron sprays away
you like that bitch
carlos swerves violently to the side towards a parked car along the side of the road
aaron is plowed along toward the car but releases jessica at the last possible second just avoiding a collision with the car
carlos was not fooling around
aaron watches them tear down the street before he about faces and walks briskly back toward the house where troy is standing on the front porch watching the action
jessica is still reeling from the pepper spray
she can barely stammer out her words
oh my god my fucking eyes
jesus look at my car jess
now im screwed too
carlos turns to look through the rear window of his car all clear
practically sobbing im so sorry
an otherwise believable apology except that carlos knows jessica too well
jessica does not want to be in this alone
carlos cuts the wheel to the right and tears down a side street
pedro pulls his tow truck and parallel parks on the street in front of the house
pedro gets out of his tow truck and walks up to the front door
he rings the doorbell
there is no answer so he rings the doorbell again then knocks on the door
again no answer so he bangs on the door vigorously
he leans over and peers inside the window
as he does so mr
carson opens the front door apparently having just woken up
whatre you doing here

carson shuts the door
pedro turns around and eyes the gray ford taurus parked behind his tow truck
he walks back to his tow truck and grabs some tools
he begins hitching up the ford taurus to his tow truck
carson parts the curtain behind his front window eyes wide as he watches pedro
the front door opens and mr
carson comes storming out

carson proceeds inside
pedro watches mr
carson proceed back into the house as he releases the ford taurus back down to the ground
the baseball field is empty

corey looks over as he starts his moped
gorski says he can beat you

corey kicks the stand up on his moped and rides off
shouting after him aw cmon

jimmy hits a button to hang up and shuts the cell phone but the cell phone immediately rings again
jimmy flips the cell phone open again
his eyes grow wide as he stares at the caller id which reads car lee
jimmy stares at the cell phone as it continues ringing and ringing
he hits a button and replaces the cell phone to his ear
who is this
kwon an asian american in his early twenties holding to his ear the cordless phone that was on the coffee table is pacing in front of car who is still
seated on the couch in the exact position we saw him last
the gym bag that jimmy emptied earlier is on the floor at his feet

sorry about car
jimmy hangs up
cars are still honking at jimmy as he continues to sit at a standstill in the intersection
generally to the other drivers fuck off
jimmy throws his piece of shit in reverse then cuts left through and out of the intersection
jimmy parallel parks his piece of shit in front of his apartment and exits carrying his backpack
he unlocks the door to his apartment opens it and steps one foot inside
jimmy slides the backpack into his apartment
tight on the backpack as it slides across the hardwood floor straight towards the camera to a halt immediately in front of the camera
jimmy steps back outside and shuts the door
corey is standing in the middle of an unkept lawn watching rob about eighteen and wearing coreys helmet ride coreys moped in circles around him on the lawn

jessica notices something turning to look out the broken passenger side window
shes stares interested
he a big dude
still staring out the window not really but he gets into fights all the time at parties and stuff
and he knows a lot of people
through the window we see that carlos car is parked across the street from cars house and that a police car and a coroners van are parked in front of
kwon is standing with a police officer more distraught than the last time we saw him answering questions
hes oblivious to jessica and carlos
id rather go over in person
jessica turns back to carlos
not exactly confident i can be more
persuasive in person
jessica punches another number into her cell phone
hello this is katie kinney

establishing shot on the car pulling back out onto the street as kwon continues talking to the police officer in the background
rob is riding his newly acquired moped with corey on the back
corey is holding rob with one hand his baseball cap with the other
he drops corey off in front of mr
as rob pulls a wheelie and exits the frame corey walks up to the front door of the house
he rings the doorbell reaching into his pocket and pulling out a wad of bills as he waits
carson opens the door

carson opens the screen door and corey hands him the bills
carson begins counting them

carson slams the door
banging on the door cmon
corey stands and stares at the door a moment
he turns and leaves resigned to a long walk back to the pool
pedro is driving nonchalantly toward the back lot
a song is playing on the car radio
wide on a parked mustang a couple empty parking spaces on the passenger side of it
pedros tow truck backs up into the frame so that its back end is almost touching the front end of the mustang
pedro climbs out of his tow truck leaving it on and starts walking around to the back of it
suddenly remembering he doubles back and sticks his head in through the driver side window checking the gas gage
its more than full
satisfied pedro proceeds toward the rear of the tow truck and hitches the mustang to the back of it
an older couple pulls into the parking lot and parks one car length from the mustang
older man and older woman climb out of their car
the older man has taken an interest in what pedro is doing
hey can i park here
very friendly si si of course
motioning toward the mustang the transmission is broke
transmissions on these cars suck
older woman notices that the front passenger side tire is flat
pointing oh and the tires flat too
pedro steps around to the passenger side of the mustang surprised to see the flat tire
ah si but thats no big deal
thats fine believe me
older man and older woman begin walking toward the entrance to the diner
as older man and older woman proceed toward the diner pedro opens the door to his tow truck and reaches in to hit the control which lifts the mustang
through the window we see patrons eating
pedro drives by in his tow truck with the mustang hitched to the back
heather is sitting on the examining table topless holding her breath as dr
cook runs a stethoscope on different areas of her back
heathers blouse and purse are lying on the examining table beside her
heather lets her breath out
youre as healthy as you were last week and last week you were as healthy as an ox
are you sure youre using that thing right
i feel this ache indicating her chest right here like im being crushed between two boards
nobodys crushing you
its all in your head
i know a couple quacks
i dont need a head doctor
i was just kidding there
heather reaches into her purse and lights a cigarette
cook sighs theyve had a discussion about heathers smoking before
heather if youre going to insist on ignoring my rules at least put your blouse on before you light up
heather hops off the bench and makes a sudden about face
she is gesturing wildly seemingly oblivious to the fact that she is half naked
cant i be concerned about my health
is that so outrageous
cook is clearly uncomfortable conversing with heather while her breasts are exposed
i just dont want to be walking around tomorrow and drop dead because my heart collapses and so that makes me weird or paranoid
heather theres nothing wrong with being concerned about your health
please put your blouse back on
heather grabs her blouse from the table and puts it back on
so ill see you next week then
suddenly friendly again okay yeah see you next week
heather leaves and shuts the door behind her
the sound of panting can be heard
two people are having sex
there are no words although the girl regularly lets out high pitched groans indicative of at least a little pain
low angle medium on allison bent over the bed mouth agape
she buries her face in the mattress revealing derek thrusting from behind
allison pops up from below
im two pounds heavier i think
derek lies back to put his head on the pillow
allison lies on top nestling her head in his chest
i knew it would hurt but that was kinda worse than i thought
she never lets me do it
i dont know
she does shave though
how come you dont shave
i dont know
i dont want to
do you love her
i dont know
how can you not know
shes got problems
i dont understand you
why do you even cheat on her with me

so much prettier than me
shes a nutcase
ill tell you what i dont know why you do it
you should have a man of your own we say it all the time me and heather
that slob you and heather introduced me to last time
he outranks me
hes a good guy
like me im a good girl and the best i can do is a guy that looks like that
you must think so
you tried to set me up with him
i thought it was a bad match
it was heathers idea
so she thinks i cant do better
you know what she thinks better than me
allison climbs out of bed and her mood changes from thoughtful to business like
she begins putting her clothes on
lets get dressed shell be here
derek looks calmly over at the alarm clock on the nightstand
lets let her walk in on us and look surprised
allison opens the door and walks out a little bow legged
jimmy walks through the front door
pizza pop spots him immediately from behind the counter
the phone rings but pizza pop ignores it
hey a jimmy
where you been
hurry sit down anna eat something
we got more deliveries for you
jimmy walks around the counter grabs a couple of slices and throws them in the oven
pizza pop picks up the phone
into the phone poppys
the door bursts open and jessica enters followed by carlos
katie is watching tv
did your parents call
where were you
out with carlos
jessica disappears into the kitchen
the vcr is broken
jessica tosses a frozen dinner into the microwave
yelling to carlos in the living room los are you hungry
jessica places two frozen dinners complete with a fork apiece down on the coffee table
katie grabs her fork
are we going to have tv dinners all weekend
you want some milk

to carlos can you make her some ice tea

carlos is disappointed that jessica wants to fix herself up to see carter
katie is already eating

katie now has a glass of ice tea in front of her
carlos is behind the tv and vcr fiddling with the wires

kind of i guess
jessica showering obscured by the semi opaque glass shower doors
heather allison and derek are seated at the table with chinese take out in front of them
a newspaper opened to the classifieds lies near dereks place at the table
derek and allison are chowing down while heather sits watching derek
derek is using a fork
take a look at that paper
theres at least a half dozen apartments i circled that would be perfect
derek continues chowing down not responding
dereks cell phone rings and he answers it
beat youre joking
beat alright ten minutes
derek hangs up stands up and puts the cell phone in his pocket
guessing at the purpose of the call completely frustrated great
that was tess

ill see you at carters when i get off
derek takes another bite gets up and heads for the door
im not dropping this
since when do you drop anything
derek exits as heathers eyes hang on him
you see that
he practically said yes
heather gets up and walks in the direction of dereks bedroom
allison instinctively rises and follows
whatre you doing
im gonna look through his shit
heather walks over to the bed and starts rifling through the mess on the nightstand
she picks up a tube of astroglide and nonchalantly throws it on the bed
youre finally flipping i think
youre a lot of help ally
heather opens the nightstand drawer and immediately pulls out a box of condoms showing them to allison
ally im on the fucking pill
he hasnt used condoms with me for weeks
so maybe those are left overs
ally these are not left overs
he never used regular condoms with me
caught off guard why not
because if he did he took two fucking days to come
i always made him wear ultra thin ribbed anything but this shit
he took too long for you
ally id be done and id have to lie there like another hour till he got off
i couldnt fucking stand it
why the hell do you think i started on the pill ally

she is snorting a line of coke off of the coffee table
well hes pretty small time but hes itchin to move up a few notches

jimmy considers then pulls a pen and his delivery list out of his pocket
he turns the delivery list over to write on the back
gimme his number man
the doors of jimmys piece of shit are flung wide open
kwon is hauling jimmys spare tire out of the trunk
kwon what the hell are you doing
kwon dumps the tire on the ground and seeing nowhere to hide anything stands straight up and looks at jimmy
when you off work
maybe nine or nine thirty
kwon tosses jimmy his keys back jumps in his bmw and takes off
jimmy becomes increasingly resolved as he watches him leave
jimmy pulls out his delivery list and his cell phone
he turns the delivery list over to the number on the back and punches it into his cell phone
he paces as he talks

corey hops on the lawn mower turns on the blade and picks up where pete left off
pete shakes his head in disgust and heads into the garage
corey is wide eyed as he turns the corner entering the last leg of his first lawn lap and spots pedro approaching in his tow truck with the mustang hitched
to the back of it
he shuts the blade off and steers the lawn mower over to the tow truck
pedro parks as corey hops off the lawn mower

corey looks over at emily laying down in a lounge chair
so you in or out

corey heads toward the garage
emily looks over at pedro sitting in the tow truck
pedro sticks his hand up to say hello to emily awkward
she ignores him and begins gathering her stuff
pete is sitting on the floor repairing a weed wacker
you done already
corey hops off the lawn mower
i got an emergency pete
ill come in early tomorrow and finish
he runs out the door
running out the door sorry
the door slams shut behind corey
music is audible from inside the house
carters house is an old dilapidated house with a tiny front yard and huge back yard surrounded by trees with rusty old cars scattered throughout
just about everybody enters the house from the back
berubi in his early twenties very large and athletic wearing mesh shorts and a beat up t shirt and a male friend of a similar age with an average build
and dressed lazily in khakis and an un tucked shirt are unloading a keg from the bed of a pick up truck onto a dolly
heather and allison are standing on the back porch
heather is holding a bottle of vodka in her hand
heather bangs on the screen door
in his early twenties carter is tough with a modestly athletic build and a gruff voice and possessing an appetite for greasy food and cheap beer
hes a guys guy
heather tries to open the screen door its stuck
carter slams the handle from the inside the door opens
busting carters chops with a mocking tone whats up
as heather passes carter mockingly shows heather the back of his hand as if to smack her
heather and allison pass and carter holds the door open with his foot as he looks for something to prop it open
from the inside we can see that carters house is the same house that jerry moved out of this morning jerry was carters housemate
heather and allison walk in as if they know their way around
carter spots a large clay lawn dwarf on the back porch
he reaches for it
stay outta my room
heather holds out the vodka
i wanna see how crazy it gets
carter props the screen door open with the lawn dwarf
pedro emily and corey now wearing the baseball cap are parked in the tow truck across the street from the front of carters house
porno magazines lie on the dashboard and the floor
berubi walking along the side of the house from the back yard spots pedro behind the wheel
to corey disapproving i cant believe youre doing this
aside to pedro ya think its a good idea we leave it out here on the street like this
aside to corey forget about that mehn
referring to berubi ill talk to berubi
i know what to say to this guy
hey pedro whats up with the mustang
berubi motions to the mustang hitched to the back of it
ah el mustang
pedro starts to climb out of the tow truck
im doing a favor for a friend
so youre driving around with his car hitched to your tow truck
pedro shuts the door to his tow truck and pulls up his shorts
bueno hes a good friend

to berubi hey listen can i sleep on your couch

to corey whats up becker
corey sticks his hand up to say hello
carloss car is parked in street in front of carters house just down the street from where pedro has parked but on the opposite side of the street and facing
in the opposite direction
through the windshield we see berubi head back toward the house as pedro glances at jessica now showered and dressed in a yellow tank top before climbing back into the
tow truck and pulling back out onto the road
carlos has noticed pedro but jessica silent as she stares at the house has not
finally carlos speaks up
did you know he was having a party
jessica grabs the rear view mirror and aims it toward herself
she begins fixing her hair in the mirror
she pulls her lipstick out of her purse and begins to apply it as carlos watches
she puts her lipstick away and stares at carters house another moment
she checks to see that her sunglasses are still hanging on the front of her shirt
jessica climbs out of the car and shuts the door
carlos follows suit
they move around the side of the house toward the back porch
jessica stops in her tracks and turns to face carlos
wait here a second and let me talk to him
without waiting for a response jessica turns around and climbs onto the back porch walking its length toward carter who is kneeling with his back to us as he puts
a tap on the keg
carlos stands watching not sure what to do
whatre you doing
carter turns around and seems disappointed to see her
you need a hand
carter climbs to his feet and heads toward the back door shaking off his hands passing right by jessica
jessica pulls her sunglasses from her shirt
carter i brought your sunglasses back
carter turns and grabs the sunglasses
those were jerrys anyway
carter heads into the house
jessica follows carter and we follow jessica
you didnt tell me that
is he pissed
who gives a shit
he moved out
carter i gotta talk to you for a sec
i gotta wash my hands
carter is just not interested in talking with jessica even if he didnt have other things on his mind
carter enters bathroom but jessica follows persistently
carter turns on the sink and washes his hands
i got a problem
its aaron that asshole
hes pissed at me
so what am i a goddam marriage counselor

jessica sees that carter has finally shown some interest

carter starts to walk out but jessica stops him
he caught something he got a rash or something
he says i gave it to him
hes got a rash

carter notices that the door to the bathroom is still open
although music is blasting outside and it is unlikely that anyone could hear their conversation carter closes the door and locks it
what the helld you give him

i did not cheat on him
you slept with me like three weeks ago

but im not a fuckin bounty hunter whose gonna chase aaron across the goddam country
jessica is not completely satisfied but carter has decided what hes going to do and thats that
carter exits leaving the door open but jessica doesnt follow
jimmy has parked his piece of shit in the rear of the back yard behind all of the other cars that have pulled in
he climbs out slides his chinese stress balls into his pocket and walks toward the house his backpack strapped over both shoulders like a schoolboy
jimmy steps through the open screen door into the kitchen
hey there he is
heather and allison are playing cards at the kitchen table with a male partygoer
they jump up from the table and approach jimmy
jimmy pulls three small bags of marijuana out of his backpack
allison pulls out some bills
counting bills i only got ten
i dont believe this shit
finishing counting nine

jimmy as he stuffs the marijuana back in his backpack and heads into the hallway
well im not going to drop to my knees for a lousy dimebag so fuck him
the door is shut
jessica is talking on her cell phone
trying to muster a sweet voice what are you doing
did your parents call
i told them you were in the shower
are you okay
oh hold on
this is my favorite part
a cartoon becomes audible through jessicas cell phone katie has put her phone up to the tv
jessica listens impatiently
can you hear it
yeah i can hear it
but katie has already put her phone up to the tv again
jessica waits turning to face the door wondering whats going on the other side of it
pedro and emily grab cups off the rusted washing machine that sits on the back porch
corey takes notice of a ping pong table set up in the back yard where barnes is playing ping pong player
barnes is skinny but attractive and has an even more attractive barnes girlfriend watching him play along with ping pong player and various partygoers
turning to grab a cup for himself i dont know about leaving the car out there in the open like that
you think we should like hide it somewhere
dont take this the wrong way mehn but youre like a girl
bitch bitch bitch
pedro begins dispensing beer from the keg
somebody could see it out there
does your pussy hurt
im serious pedro
whos gonna see it out there by the woods
everybody who reads tomorrows paper
shut up emily
no you shut up
do you know how embarrassing you are
look it was bad luck as usual
the car ran out of gas in the driveway
the gage was busted
everybody at school makes fun of me
and it was way down the block anyway
to corey and then you try to put everything back
i mean god how stupid can you be
just shut up alright
cause you dont know shit about anything
the herald had a picture of the owner laughing at you
corey drops his beer and moves in aggressively grabbing emily by the wrists
listen im sick of your shit
struggling to break free get off me
you fucking loser
emily falls on her ass
no wonder victor tried to fuck you
emily stands up turns around and heads toward the back door leading into the kitchen storming past a teenage boy and teenage girl passionately kissing each other against a tree
in the back yard
we hang on the couple as emily walks out of frame
as the boy works his way down to her neck the girls eyes open for a moment and catch someone watching her
jimmy is standing in the kitchen in front of the door looking out onto the back porch staring at the couple making out momentarily transfixed
jimmys hand is in his pocket turning his chinese stress balls over and over and over
the girl closes her eyes again and jimmy is forgotten the moment lost
jimmy is alone again still as usual
jimmy scans the cramped kitchen
partygoers are talking laughing carrying on making out in the way that partygoers will
jimmys gaze wanders mechanically to anther part of the kitchen falls upon the entrance to the living room
the terribly familiar figure buggerin bobby bales stands tall proud talking to several partygoers the light behind him adding a regal air to his menacing frame a transcendent silhouette for
a hellish vision
bobby towers easily over his peers
in his powerful hands he holds a tiny notepad on which he scribbles as his clients eagerly place their bets
rj a young african american early twenty something easily six feet tall built like a powerlifter his worn out t shirt doing little to hide his powerful frame appears behind
jimmy turns around to face rj
sinjin said youd be wearin a bookbag
theyre back here
jessica moves past rj and jimmy toward the back door
as rj about faces to lead jimmy out of the kitchen and deeper into the house we follow jessica outside
jessica sees carlos standing against a post on the back porch drinking his beer
he is surrounded by several partygoers but isnt talking to any of them
where you been
talking to carter
is he gonna help
he said he would
carlos pulls a pint of whiskey out of his back pocket
jessica accepts the whiskey and takes a long pull
she holds onto the whiskey without saying anything and carlos does not object
she begins to take in the sights and sounds of the party and notices corey leaning against a rusty old washing machine near the keg as pedro hands him another
jessicas pov as corey spots her standing next to carlos
he continues to stare at jessica clearly taken by the sight of her his eyes locking onto hers
the desperation of their individual struggles is lost for a moment
you want me to talk to her
the moment quickly passes as corey turns his attention back to pedro
so lets go fix the tire on the mustang
corey attention is again drawn to the ping pong game and jessica takes note
to jessica you wanna play
carlos motions toward the large kitchen window
jessica turns to look through it
jessica and carlos are staring through the window at the card game taking place at the kitchen table
heather and allison are back at it with the male partygoer they were playing with earlier as well as card player who has recently joined them
heather is smoking a cigarette
card player is dealing a round of asshole
all are visibly drunk
examining her cards whats dickhead doing
i knew he was lying
jessica turns toward the steps leading out onto the back yard and carlos follows
heather and card player each place one card face down on the table exchanging one for the other
to card player this is your best card
i aint happy about it
shut up and drink asshole
to allison i should call him
card player obeys and drinks
he said hell be here
hes probably got that tess on all fours fucking the shit out of her like the skank she is
thinking about it no youre right fuck him
throwing three fours down on the table face up drink
fucking everyone drink
all obey heather
we recognize the room as jerrys old bedroom empty except for a bed stripped of its sheets a naked pillow a beat up dresser with a small tv on top
of it and a few posters and scraps of trash that have been left behind
jimmy and rj are looking across the room at sinjin a young african american male about rjs age with an average build sharply dressed in a button down and sport
sinjin has his back to jimmy and is bouncing up and down on a rusty old pogo stick his behavior constituting a sharp contrast to his stylish threads
louie an overweight slobbish caucasian male a few years older than sinjin sits in a rickety old wheelchair that might creak even more than sinjins pogo stick in louies lap
rests a bowling ball bag
upon seeing sinjin and louie jimmy fondles his water bottle nervously
he turns around to watch rj closing the door behind them
sinjin spins on the pogo stick and spots rj and jimmy standing at the entrance
sinjin loses his balance and places a foot on the ground
he steps off the pogo stick and composes himself after his exhaustive venture
referring to jimmys got any calzones in there
sinjin tosses the pogo stick aside
re the pogo stick its harder than it looks
sinjin turns the garbage can over and sits on it while motioning to the bed
comfortably to jimmy sit down man sit down
rj walks over to lock the door as jimmy inches closer into the room
yo door dont lock
well you got to stand your big muthafuckin ass outside then cause aint nobody comin in here
everybody looks at rj
i dont give a shit
rj steps out and shuts the door behind him
jimmy sit down sit down
jimmy is clearly uncomfortable at the sight of these two
i like to stand usually
that legless waste is louie
i got legs little massey muthafucka
to sinjin i thought it was gonna be just me an you
dont be worryin louie hes just here to have a good time
emily is standing on the front steps wondering whether to continue outside or head back inside
shes completely out of place here among the older crowd
female partygoer and a partygoer appear behind her in the doorway behind her
emily politely moves down to the bottom of the stairs and steps aside
she watches as female partygoer and the partygoer pass by her into the front yard
corey and pedro climb off the back porch toward the ping pong table
barnes and ping pong player are just finishing a point which barnes takes easily as ping pong player waits his turn
barnes is skinny but attractive and has an even more attractive barnes girlfriend watching him play
what the hell are you doing
we got shit to do mehn important shit
ping pong player steps back and notes corey approaching
hey come beat this asshole
hey nineteen ten lets go
screw it you won again
becker cant beat me
to barnes girlfriend handing corey his paddle watch this
corey steps to the table opposite barnes confident but unenthusiastic
corey is not playing for the fun of it somewhere deep down corey wants to remind himself that hes good at something
barnes tosses the ping pong ball to corey
you serve becker
coreys first serve is wicked fast and spinning wildly
barnes has no chance
not too good baby
pedro stands alongside and watches silently pensive his mind distraught over their larger dilemma
go find mitch
pedro leaves obediently
jessica takes another pull from the whiskey
carlos is watches attentively
take it easy
you got to go back and watch katie
dont remind me
you signed up for it
it seemed like a good idea then
give some crappy advice every once in a while
i didnt think itd be this constant torture always wanting to do something go somewhere
im so sick of it
some big sister
jessica takes another drink and looks toward the ping pong table where corey is manhandling barnes as ping pong player ping pong player barnes girlfriend and various partygoers look on
jimmy walks in from living room looking for bobby
he continues on toward the back door leading out onto the back porch
a dense gathering of partygoers is packed tight within the confines of carters room rather small despite being the largest bedroom in the house
the collection of partygoers are watching with religious fervor the basketball game playing from the modest tv in the room
carter berubi aaron and troy are among the crowd
all those gathered here have an interest in the game but none as much as buggerin bobby bales who stands back against the far wall though the nobody in the
congregation dares venture into his sightline of the television
partygoers yell in unison at various events displayed on the screen
the door opens and pedro peeks into the room
shut the door
pedro shuts the door
heather and allison are sitting on a couch facing each other very drunk and extremely happy
the coffee table in front of them is filled with plastic cups and liquor bottles many of which are empty
i would never
you little slut
i got one for you
pointing to someone off camera right over there in front of the door
looking down the hallway outside jerrys bedroom we see rj standing against the door
he does not notice the girls looking at him from the living room
thoughtfully well hes got a nice body
hes a little scary looking
he scares me
you like it too you little slut
youre the slut
alright okay yeah
grabbing a bottle of vodka and a cup bring him a drink
allison grabs for the vodka but heather does not let go
motherly tone no ally this one is for me

picking up and putting down various empty liquor bottles before finally grabbing a bottle of tequila with a bit left take him this

i think so
heather takes another hit of vodka
jimmy has his cell phone to his ear waiting for voicemail anxious
bobby where the hell are you
i gotta talk to you

jimmy hangs up and takes a moment to think about his options
corey and barnes are continue to play as ping pong player ping pong player barnes girlfriend and various partygoers continue to watch
in the background jessica paces back and forth as carlos sits on the ground indian style watching the partygoers on the back porch
carlos takes a shot of whiskey
emily stands against the garage door keeping to herself
allison has her head back on the couch as heather lights a cigarette
mitch approaches the ladies with a beer in his hand
mitch is a staunch thirty something mechanic with a beer gut dressed in levis overalls and wearing a backwards baseball cap and a beard that together hide much of his
primarily to heather hey girls whatre you drinking

allison plops down on all fours and begins vomiting violently
heather kneels down next to allison and pulls her hair back so it doesnt get hit by the vomit
allison has a few more convulsions

allison sits up fixes her hair then grabs the vodka from heather
allison takes a mouthful rinses and spits
allison then takes a drink
my god ally
pedro and mitch make their way into the back yard towards the ping pong table
ping pong player ping pong player barnes girlfriend and various partygoers are gathered around corey and barnes
corey functions mechanically his mind is not on the game
barnes is openly frustrated as corey finishes him off
reaching for barnes let someone else play barnes

emily takes male partygoer s drink and does the same
derek is traveling on a busy road with the sirens of his police car activated
cars are pulling over to let him pass but it is taking some time
he pulls out his cell phone and punches in some numbers
the room is crowded with partygoers
the cordless phone is ringing and drunk partygoer answers it clearly drunk

drunk partygoer loses focus and rejoins them
corey and mitch barter over the mustang though mitch seems more interested in his beer than the car
pedro is putting the last touches on putting on the new tire
he picks the flat tire up and tosses it in the trunk
its a good car

aaron and troy step out onto the back porch and spot jessica and carlos
upon seeing them carlos stands straight up
jessica still pacing stops in her tracks and turns around beside carlos
its too late to gracefully exit so carlos stands there frozen
jessica does not seem afraid
aaron and troy approach
its clear troy doesnt really want to be there
to carlos hey guy

aaron i didnt mean nothin

carlos painfully does not answer
jessica unfazed takes another hit of whiskey
jessica is confident because of the booze and because of carters promise

the whiskey is almost gone
jessica grabs back the whiskey wipes it off as aaron did and polishes it off

jessica storms toward carlos car and carlos follows
allison is lying on her back on the couch with her head in heathers lap
heather is stroking allisons hair
theyre both obliterated and just stuttering away

wide on heather and allison
the noise of the party drowns out their conversation
allison is whispering forcefully into heathers ear
heather is listening but cannot hear
we see her lips form the word what
allison continues whispering and heathers face becomes furious
she pushes allison back
you fucking slut
heather shoves allison hard off the couch
as allison stumbles roughly and attempts to recover partygoers mostly guys gather around cheering wildly
heather kicks furiously at allison who is on all fours employing the turtle defense
we catch a glimpse of allisons face she is in utter panic
heathers foot catches allison square in the face knocking her limp
most of the crowd has stopped cheering
heather continues to kick at allisons limp body and two skinny guys pull heather away
heather shakes them off and leaves in a huff while everyone is tending to allison
heather visibly psychotic and still very drunk is making a beeline straight for rj who shows no sign of noticing heather until she is directly in front of him
pointing to berubis bedroom wanna take me in there and fuck my brains out
sure i dont give a shit
fucking great lets go
heather heads towards berubis bedroom and rj follows passing jimmy and buggerin bobby bales
jimmy looks back at rj as he passes
jimmy reenters the room he retreated from earlier with bobby in tow
the room is empty
what the fuck jimmy
just hold on
jimmy steps further into the room and stands pensive as bobby takes a seat
bobby lights up a cigarette
i cant figure you jimmy
where the fuck is rj
the door bursts open again with a violent thrash and louie fires into view on his wheelchair with sinjin pushing from behind
take it easy you stupid motherfucker
sinjin kicks the door shut with the back of his foot and wheels louie into the room
louie is holding a half full bottle of jack daniels in his hand the bowling ball bag still in his lap
this your partner
where you been
just gettin a drink jimmy
you took long enough
sinjin wheels louie in a haphazard indirect arc somehow closing on the center of the room
the doorknob rattles
to louie thought that shit didnt lock
sinjin is staring at the door but louie is pre occuppied
to bobby youre buggerin bobby bales
excuse me you cripple motherfucker
buggerin bobby bales
sayeed knows you
call me that again
louie takes a strong pull from the bottle of jack
louie shut the fuck up
lets just do this
call you what again
what everyone calls you
call me that
buggerin bobby bales
bobby stands tosses his cigarette aside and marches toward louie
sinjin knowingly looses his grip on the wheelchair and steps back
bobby lets relax now
louie may be a fool
bobby grabs louie by the collar and throws him from the wheelchair
louis lands heavily on his crippled frame dazed the bowling ball bag dribbling onto the floor near sinjin
bobby grabs the wheelchair in both hands and begins smashing it against the wall and into the floor
as jimmy and sinjin watch dumbfounded the large clay lawn dwarf we saw earlier bursts trough the window and lands in the center of the room
everyone stops to stare at the lawn dwarf including bobby
jessica storms through the yard toward carlos car
carlos is right behind
whered we park
carlos begins walking over to his car and jessica walks alongside
jessica is clearly drunk
passing by a now high emily backed up against a tree staring off into nowhere as male partygoer kisses her neck they arrive at carlos car
carlos walks over to the driver side door but jessica walks immediately over to the trunk
what are you doing
open the trunk
jess lets get out of here
i want your bat
im gonna finish what i started
im gonna knock his teeth out
lets just go home
carlos open the trunk
carlos grudgingly obeys
he walks back to the trunk and inserts his key then lifts up
jessica reaches in and grabs a wooden baseball bat
she shuts the trunk and looks over to the house
aaron walks through carters front door and steps onto the porch troy right behind
aaron is holding a bag of frozen vegetables to his head in the area where jessica hit him with the whiskey bottle
he spots carlos and jessica and walks deliberately toward them
get in the car
im staying and so are you so shut up
carlos swallows his pride too yellow to push the point
aaron moves toward jessica very quickly but a look at the bat jessica is holding makes aaron keep his distance
whats the matter
arent you gonna put me in my place
calming down why dont you put that down
because im gonna use it to bash your head in
you really want to do that
you really wanna make me
youre gonna do what youre gonna do like always
what the hells that supposed to mean
let me show you something
can i show you
inching closer to jessica and beginning to loosen his pants i just wanna show you something
jessica stands back and holds the bat in a cocked position
no more a this shit aaron
just stand back there
ill bash you with this i swear
aaron drops the frozen vegetables to the ground and loosens his pants
look just hold on
i wanna show you this
i got it a little while ago for your birthday
aaron lowers the left side of his pants to reveal a scarring tattoo which is placed above and to the side of his groin
jessica looks closer
troy uncomfortable and not wanting to be there lights up another cigarette
can you see it
what the hell is it
i got it for your birthday
not knowing what to say bullshit
will you come closer and look
troy tell her
to jessica its your initials
i told him it was stupid
jessica lowers the bat and walks cautiously up to aaron
she attempts to read the tattoo which is difficult because of the low light and the scarring
you like it dont you
i knew you would
youre an idiot
jessica touches the tattoo
does that hurt
try whacking it with the bat
jessica laughs as aaron smiles
troy is bored
carlos is miserable
jessica stands up in front of aaron holding the bat loosely by her side unsure of what to do
aaron gently grabs jessica around the elbows and pulls her close
he puts his arms around her and hugs her loosely
can we just forget about this
aaron hugs jessica tightly as she drops the bat and hugs back
emily her back up against a tree continues making out with an aggressive male partygoer
as male partygoer comes up for air we see that he has a hand down emilys pants fingering her
emilys mind is somewhere else
emily snaps back to reality and removes male partygoer s hand and pushes him away from her she wont become another slut in a town full of them
hey whats wrong
emily makes for the front door and into the house
mitch has refilled his beer and patiently waits for a counteroffer from corey
how about two thousand even
impatient with the proceedings pedro walks over to the passenger door of the mustang swings it open and leans inside struggling a bit
cant do it
its not economically
searching for the word good right sound whatever
pedro reappears from the backseat holding an expensive stereo
okay give us two thousand and i give you this nice stereo for free
where the hell you get that
yeah what the hell is that
to mitch it was in the car
i dont want a stereo

wheres the speakers

corey walks over opens the door and looks in the back
his gaze falls upon an item on the floor in the back seat area
this stereos a motherfucker mehn im telling you

corey pulls out from the back seat of the mustang holding a large red and blue police light
he is dumbfounded
corey looks to pedro for an explanation
i thought youd tell me
it looks like police cherries
it cant be
look fellas id like to help you out but im not into buying stolen cop cars
it dont seem right somehow
corey and pedro struggle for an explanation but are left speechless
jessica and aaron are leaning against a random partygoers car
they look very calm
i didnt cheat

well what the hell can i do
i got your goddam initials tattood next to my balls
it was a stupid thing to do
you dont like it

then you could start going to church
two police cars pull onto the lawn to break up the party both cars flashing their red and blue lights
troy approaches jessica and aaron
to jessica you need a lift
corey pedro and mitch notice a police car containing police officer and police officer as it pulls into the back yard
pedro is still holding the stereo
partygoers carry on barely concerned that the police are breaking up the party
police officer spots the mustang hitched to the tow truck a look of knowing recognition on his face
ill be fucked
staring at the lights pedro get in the truck
police officer speaks into the c
hey janice tell tim i found his car
from far off corey understands from the manner that the police officers have focused on the mustang that theyve been spotted
pedro lets get the hell outta here
police officer rushes out of the car followed by police officer
pedro turns to mitch
coge keep this
pedro practically throws the stereo into mitchs stomach
mitch completely shocked drops his beer and grabs the stereo out of instinct
pedro darts for the passenger seat of the tow truck
what the hell am i supposed to do with this
keep it mehn
i gotta go
corey moves to the driver side door of the tow truck and opens it and climbs behind the wheel
pedro climbs into the passenger seat
you better bring that truck back
harvey is pissed
corey starts the tow truck and tries to shift it into gear
where the hell is first
pedro grabs the stick shift and throws it into first
corey hits the gas and the transmission screeches its disapproval
mehn use the clutch
the tow truck conks out
pedro opens the door and jumps out
corey remains seated frozen hands on the dashboard
police officer quickly overtakes pedro and throws him to the ground
police officer rushes over to the tow truck and points his gun at corey
out of the truck asshole
heather and rj are in berubis bedroom
heather is on top of rj and the sex is extremely rough
heather notices the red and blue lights continue flashing on the curtains staring entranced by them
rj looks up to see what shes staring at
what the fuck
heather does not respond as she continues bouncing up and down on top of rj
corey gets out of the truck hands in the air
police officer handcuffs pedro
police officer takes out his handcuffs spins corey around by his arm and throws him roughly against the tow truck cuffing his hands behind his back
in the background mitch quietly places the stereo on the ground and begins walking indiscreetly toward the street
pov on jimmy bobby sinjin and louie staring at the wall opposite the door
bobby is still holding whats left of louies wheelchair
sinjin throws his hands up in disgust disbelief
we see what theyre staring at kwon is climbing clumsily through the window
a large gun falls heavily to the floor and kwon falls in after it

kwon grabs his gun and stands up slightly out of breath from his climb

jimmy watches powerless

a chinese stress ball hits kwon in the forehead
dazed kwon can only blink his eyes tries to gather his senses
bobby stares at kwon a moment before landing his large fist square on kwons nose knocking him empty handed and on his ass beside sinjin
sinjin stands up to get between bobby and kwon
alright everybody calm the fuck down
this shits gettin outta hand bang
everybody freezes as the sound and smoke of a gunshot lingers then checks to make sure they werent hit
as doorknob starts rattling with increasing intensity everyone checks to make sure they werent hit then turns to the source of the gunshot
louie is holding the gun as he lays on his side having scrambled to grab the gun
the door bursts open its rj out of breath
police officer is using one hand to hold onto pedro still handcuffed by his upper arm and the other hand to unlock and open the rear driver side door of
his police car
police officer watches as he keeps hold of corey by his handcuffs
to police officer holy shit you hear that
the two officers hasten their actions
police officer lowers pedro into the police car then moves to the front seat of the vehicle and grabs the c

police officer shoves corey into the police car next to pedro
corey and pedro sit in the rear of the police car and police officer slams the door
through the windshield we see police officer run toward the house as he draws his pistol
he moves up the porch past
derek walks up the steps onto the back porch as partygoers move out of the house away from the sound of the gunshot
he notices police officer behind him

moving up the porch and into the house we should get everybody out of the house
derek and police officer turn to see heather walking onto the back porch from the kitchen

derek doubles over and heather grabs him by the hair
police officer shoves heather to the ground grabs dereks handcuffs and cuffs her hands behind her
derek is still stunned from the assault
derek you alright
allison who had been standing back watching the assault approaches heather who is getting up onto her knees
allison gets on her knees and hugs heather who cannot hug back because of the handcuffs
allison is bawling
im so sorry heather im so sorry
heather is shutting her eyes extremely tightly struggling not to cry
she does not attempt to pull away from allisons tight embrace
sinjin marches straight toward louie who wears the pathetic look of a child about to be disciplined
what the fuck are you shootin at
pointing at bobby him

sinjin grabs the gun from louie
kwon is sitting up still dazed holding a handkerchief to stem the flow of blood streaming out of his nose

sinjin disappears out the window
bobby is about to follow but turns back toward jimmy

kwon stands over jimmy
foreboding ill see you around jimmy
jimmy watches as kwon exits out the window
most of the partygoers are clearing out of the house moving toward their cars but some of the more curious stragglers are gathering around on the back porch wondering what
police officer is encouraging everyone to leave
everybody clear outta here
there was a gunshot
pointing back toward the bedrooms over there

clear outta here
police officer enters the house passing carlos among the crowd making its way out of the house
he walks across the back yard with his keys in his hand
he glances down at his shoes a moment as he spots jessica aaron and troy approaching
jimmy enters and moves across the frame toward his piece of shit parked in the rear of the back yard

police officer is looking through jerrys old bedroom noticing the hole in the wall
we can hear police officer knocking on the bathroom door in the hallway
anybody in there
this is the police
were clearing everybody out
we move past police officer out into the hallway toward the noise
policer officer is opening the bathroom door gun raised and is stopped dead in his tracks by what he sees
two legs are hanging out the side of the bathtub belonging to a girl whose the rest of whose body is obscured from view
police officer drops his gun to his side and steps into the bathroom staring down into the bathtub
police officer walks up into the bathroom noticing the bullet hole in the wall just beside the mirror
we see what they do emily is lying back across the width of the bathtub eyes open but utterly vacant a gunshot wound through her cheek just below her cheekbone
carter is moving from the living room toward the bedrooms
police officer stops him
you cant come back here
whadda ya mean i cant go back there

carter is persistent and police officer puts his hands up against carter
some of the stragglers are still scattered throughout the side of the house opposite the bedrooms and bathroom
berubi is forcefully waving them out of the house
get your fucking hands off me
get the fuck out
get the fuck out
get the fuck out
the stragglers exit out the front door
stragglers are heading out the front door joining the other partygoers in looking for their cars
stragglers are heading out the back door joining the other partygoers in looking for their cars and for their friends
a few partygoers remain continue to loiter in groups scattered sparsely throughout the yard
heather is seated in the back of a police car with her hands cuffed behind her back
heathers body is contorted to her side to relieve the discomfort caused by the handcuffs
through the window facing carters house we see a figure approaching
as the figure nears we recognize derek seemingly recovered from his earlier thrashing
heather does not notice derek as he nears the door
derek opens the door
heather looks up at him
get away from me
derek pulls heather from the police car and the exhausted heather gives only nominal resistance
derek unlocks her handcuffs
heather turns around
you should get out of here before the other officers come back
heather walks past derek and derek does not turn to follow her
heather notices allison standing several car lengths away
allison has her arms crossed across her body as if she were hugging herself for warmth both her and heathers purses strapped over her shoulder her keys dangling from her
heather begins walking slowly towards allison passing by
corey and pedro are seated in the back of the police car
corey looks over at pedro the look of foolish optimism usually present on pedros face has vanished
he looks down at the floor of the police car
through the side window of the police car we see jessica aaron and troy and climbing into troys car
troy is handing aaron his keys before climbing into the back seat
aaron is behind the wheel sticking the keys into the ignition
jessica is in the passenger seat looking through her purse for her cigarettes
troy sits in the back seat spent
i left my novel in carlos car
you wanna get it
ill get it tomorrow
we should just get out of here
aaron starts the car as jessica lights her cigarette
without warning as jessica takes a drag aaron punches jessica square in the jaw
the lit cigarette flies out of jessicas mouth and jessica falls out of view
aaron reaches down grabs the cigarette and puts it in his mouth still angry
he slowly pulls the car out of the back yard and toward the street passing jimmys piece of shit parked in the opposite direction
the engine is still off
jimmy is sitting still behind the wheel hands down in his lap staring straight ahead
pull in and hold on jimmy
establishing shot with the house in focus in the background
a few stragglers remain in the backyard smoking cigarettes gossiping staring back at the house etc
rack focus to a group of stragglers in the foreground to the right of the frame straggler and straggler smoking cigarettes among them
straggler flicks his cigarette and leads all of the group except straggler frame left toward the street
straggler glances back at the house before taking a final puff of his cigarette
he stomps it out under his foot and exits frame left after his buddies
