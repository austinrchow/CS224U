written by james ponsoldt susan burke september th clinking glasses and other assorted bar sounds
lets give a hand to rodney
scattered applause and laughter
next up weve got a little lady named
close on kate hannah late s pretty and wholesome and oh yeah piss drunk
she stands on a tiny in the far corner of a half empty dive bar
kate holds a microphone and dances as she sings a bad karaoke version of song to be determined
what kate lacks in talent she more than makes up for with charm and enthusiasm
at a table near the stage is charlie hannah kates husband late s scruffy but handsome also pretty damn drunk
he enthusiastically claps and points to kate making up a cheering section along with owen hannah charlies younger brother early s who sings along with the small but energetic crowd
kate begins to ramble between verses and gleefully points to charlie and owen
for the moment this drunk girl is the queen of karaoke
kate finishes the song and drunkenly tumbles off the stage to join charlie and owen
that was so good baby
you sing like an angel a drunk angel
owen and kate laugh
if you were writing about my performance for your blog what would you say
id say that uh
my wife is the sexiest most amazing woman alive
that would be such a shitty article nobody would read it
kate and charlie laugh and kiss and then kate glances at owen and makes a puppy dog face
to owen aw
we need to find you a lady owen
yeah ive been trying to flirt with the bartender but
i cant tell
owen motions to the female bartender early s
what cant you tell
she looks like she could kick my ass
no way would she go for a guy like me
youre being a little girl just go talk to her
clearly shy i dont know
forget about it
not going to take no for an answer ill take point follow me
kate stumbles to the bar
charlie and owen follow
kate puts her arms around owen and gets the attention of the bartender
i want to buy a gimlet for me and a double shot of whiskey for my brother in law cause hes had a hard week
the bartender quickly pours the drinks
wait dont you wanna know what happened to him
the bartender rolls her eyes and checks around the bar to see if there are other customers
its pretty dead so she listens
unenthused what happened
he just got back from england because he went there for a girl
a preppy bitchy girl
that was her name
he loved her so much that he went with her because she had a fellowship or something
he gave up being a kickboxer
sad and she dumped him
the bartender sizes up owen
the trio waits with anticipation to hear her response which is to owen you kickbox
caught in the headlights yeah
thats all owens got
jumping in and he teaches kids at the kickboxing studio
oh theyre so cute
the bartender glances back to owen
finally a lot of em dont have parents so
its kinda more than just a teacher student thing
beat i know it sounds silly but i feel responsible for them like
emotional i could be their parent
kate slides down the bar to charlie
hushed i think i got him laid
she seems totally game
sure she just didnt want to get into your pants
kate rolls her eyes
i think im done for the night
owen wanders over dejected
shes seen say anything
whatre you gonna do huh
beat wanna drive us home
no he needs to keep working it
you guys stay here
i dont want to watch my brother not score
i want to go to bed with you and
whispered into kates ear you know
ill be home when you get there
we can you know then
to charlie yeah man you dont have a job to wake up for in the morning or anything
writing is a job
not having to report to an office only makes work harder
to kate baby you drank a lot
i think owen should take us home youre too drunk to drive
suddenly focused im not that drunk
besides you know i focus when i drive it sobers me up
tell that to the cops
kate kisses charlie and hugs owen
to charlie i love you baby
ill be waiting for you in a nice warm bed
you have exactly one mission get your brother laid and dont talk to any other women
that sounds like two missions
no its just one
to owen it kinda sounded like two right
nodding it did
kate grins and slowly backs away towards the door
really fast goodbyeiloveyouboth
kate stumbles out of the bar and hears a groan
she glances over and sees a drunk woman freda s sitting on the curb
she moans again
kate glances around the parking lot
nobody else but her and freda
taken aback um
whispers hey im not really okay
my bitch sister just took off and left me here so she could hook up with some asshole
now what am i supposed to do
i dont have a car here
i guess i could
youll give me a ride
oh my god
freda gets up quickly and almost falls over
i was gonna say call you a cab cause you know i dont even know you
its not far
kate looks dismayed
not sure what to do
the car passes through chinatown on its way downtown
kate drives with freda in the passenger seat
freda glances down at the floor and notices a flask
you know you shouldnt drink and drive
i wasnt just kidding
can i have a sip
im really thirsty
fuck yeah its whiskey
i love whiskey
youre the real thing huh
a hardcore drinking bitch like me
freda takes a swig from kates flask
i dont know
can i smoke in your car
slightly annoyed okay fine go ahead
can you just roll down the window
of course im not uncivilized
freda takes out a crack pipe and lights it deeply inhaling crack smoke
in disbelief kate immediately pulls the car over
not what i thought you meant
want a hit
is that pot
as though its a ridiculous question of course not
what do i look like
beat its crack
no thank you
cmon its good crack
i dont um
ive never smoked crack
this stuff is the truth and itll sober you up
i think you should go
im not getting out in the middle of nowhere
do you know what could happen to me all alone out here at night
i dont know people might offer you crack
its not a big deal just take a little hit
kate and freda stare at each other
a stand off
i said no
one hit wont hurt you
itll sober you up
kate glances at the pipe which freda wiggles in front of her
high pitched cartoon voice smoke me
then we are both going home
freda puts the pipe into kates lips and lights it
kate sucks in crack smoke
her eyelids flutter
youve got money right
near some tents cardboard boxes and shopping carts kate smokes crack with freda and two older men
they pass around two pipes
freda is passed out on a sleeping bag on the sidewalk
kate is animatedly telling a story to the two guys whore still smoking crack
mile a minute fast cause i feel like i understand what its like to be homeless ya know
i mean if you didnt know me if we hadnt connected tonight you might think theres some upper middle class npr listening self congratulatory insulated lazy liberal bitch
probably never had to worry about anything
but thats not true at all
i grew up poor man
mcdonalds used to have one day a week where they sold cent hamburgers and another day where they had cent cheeseburgers
my mom and me would go there and shed get twenty burgers that was the limit probably set up for folks just like us and then shed put em in
the freezer and wed microwave em for dinner throughout the week
i was kinda overweight until high school to be perfectly honest
eating used to be my thing
when i started drinking though i kinda stopped eating so much
back on track but anyway the point is you and me were not so different
the two guys arent paying much attention to kate
theyre more concerned with their crack pipe
kate is asleep on the curb
she looks awful
suddenly kates eyes widen
she looks around at her surroundings confused then jumps to her feet
kate runs through the streets
we track along with kate as she dashes past various buildings
we stare down a long empty street the downtown skyscrapers towering in the distance
from out of nowhere kate appears at the end of the street and sprints towards the camera
kate drives a paranoid expression on her face and her hands tightly gripping the steering wheel
she glances down at her cell phone in the passenger seat
she passes various sites on her way from downtown to highland park
kate slowly pulls into the driveway of a small cute house
kate walks into the kitchen to find charlie asleep at the kitchen table
cell phone next to his head
empty beer bottles litter the table
kate tip toes across the kitchen
charlie quickly jerks up
its okay baby
go back to sleep
i came home and you were gone and i waited and waited
its a long story
i was worried
i kept calling you
i ended up
charlie sniffs kate
you smell funny
what do you smell like
i fell asleep in my car
near the bar
i was too drunk to drive
so why didnt you come back or call me
charlie beat im fine
well maybe im not
i worry baby
i love you and you know how you get sometimes
i love you too
but im home
i gotta get to work
i cant be worried about you all the time
kate rubs charlies hair and kisses his forehead
dont worry so much
beat cmon let me get you to bed
im up now how bout i make us bacon and egg sandwiches
knows hes got her magic words
kate takes a shower while she drinks a beer
puts on make up
kate walks into the kitchen ready to go
charlie is at the stove cooking bacon and eggs
he hands kate a mug of coffee and gestures to the table where theres a check
check for your moms on the table
kate takes a sip of coffee
why does the coffee taste so much better when you make it
because i make it with love and bacon
kate laughs and kisses charlie
kate takes a right on a street and then pulls into the shes about to get out but then notices
the flask on the floor
kate chugs whats left in the flask
davies the assistant principal early s slightly nerdy but not bad looking watches kate drink in her car
children pass by in the distance
davies takes a beat but instead of saying anything he walks away through the parking lot
kate doesnt notice shes been seen
kate stands next to a chalkboard in front of a class of third graders
shes really animated doing her game show hostess schtick
on the chalkboard are the letters an to the class now if i add a c what word do i have
a student raises her hand
youve won an all expenses paid trip to the blackboard hillary
she looks embarrassed
theres a washer dryer combo in it for you
hillary shuffles up to the board and writes can
great job hillary lets give her a round of applause
the class applauds
hillary smiles and goes back to her seat
can anyone use can in a sentence
a student angela raises her hand
hurry up in there i gotta use the can
the students giggle
quickly moving on wonderful angela
you get a camaro with flames painted on the hood
the students cheer
now to the class whats another word i could make by adding a letter to an
nobody raises their hand
finally a student in the back ramon raises his hand
okay what word would that make if i added a p
come on down
ramon walks up and begins to write pan
just look at that excellent penman kate stops suddenly and raises her hand to her mouth
she quickly runs behind her desk leans over and discretely vomits on the floor
ramon whos just inches from the pool of vomit looks horrified
kate glances up from behind her desk to see
the kids all make grossed out faces and say things like embarrassed kate quickly gets tissues from her desk and begins cleaning up the mess
to the class im so sorry you had to see that
hillary stands up
hannah are you pregnant
my mommy threw up when she was pregnant with my little sister
are you pregnant
some of the kids begin whispering saying things like ooh
shes gonna have a baby
kate seems flustered and says yes
kate sits across a desk from principal barnes female early s stern scattered and clearly a softy at heart she wears a pair of glasses around her neck
vice principal davies will be looking after your students for the rest of the day so you dont need to worry about that
oh thats really good to know
ill have to thank him
beat i just feel awful for getting sick in front of my students
oh please theyre troopers
im sure theyve seen plenty worse
beat so how long have you been pregnant
its the first trimester
well its very exciting
you must be thrilled
nods uh huh
can i ask a
beat going for you
the pregnancy i mean
kates not sure how to respond
having kids wasnt in the cards for me
i came close but
principal barnes drifts off into thought for a moment then catches herself and quickly shifts gears
i mean its like ive got a couple hundred kids here forces a laugh but
i dont fool myself
its not the same
considers her reply well
its hard to explain
i wouldnt call it a burden but its a responsibility
nods youre so lucky
beat can i
um i dont
okay but it sleeps a lot
principal barnes gets up and kneels next to kate
she places her hand on kates belly and closes her eyes
whispers hello in there
can you hear me
youre a tiny miracle
did you know that
principal barnes looks up at kate and smiles with tears in her eyes
kate walks down the hall and comes to the door of her classroom
through the glass she sees mr
he notices kate and smiles the concerned smile you give someone right after theyve publicly embarrassed themselves
kate mouths the words silent thank you
and gestures come here
davies gestures to the class that hell be right back before he walks out to talk to kate
hes got a slightly nervous demeanor somewhere between i never became comfortable talking to women and aspergers
is everything um
im really embarrassed but i feel a lot better
and i just wanted to say thank you
davies glances down the hall
look im not a fool
whispered i know you were drinking this morning
kate looks shocked
i saw you
taken aback oh no i
drinking when youre pregnant is really dangerous
i know that
oh god i
long beat listen im not actually pregnant
im just really hung over
the kids started asking me questions after i vomited and i panicked
please dont say anything
davies looks torn unsure how to respond
get some sleep
before kate can say a word mr
davies heads back into the classroom
kate has her face fully in the sink while water runs over it and two little girls curiously watch
kate and charlie play pool while splitting a pitcher of beer
its a bit early to be drinking but hey why not
i had such a crappy morning
i spent like three hours at the post office trying to buy stamps and stuff
kate takes a long sip of beer
i told my class i was pregnant
charlie looks up at kate with a beaming smile
he leans over and grabs her hand
excited and sort of confused oh baby thats im not
so dont worry
beat cause it would be great news if it was true
beat course then id have to drink your beer
well it was a lie
i just lied to my class
after barfing in front of them
yeah thats what they said
long beat listen
i cant do this anymore
a look of complete terror and confusion passes over charlies face
what do you mean
i think i might
drink too much
you kinda do
charlie swigs his beer
i know i do im a fucking mess
baby thats not true
and i love you
i wouldnt be married to a mess
i left work after puking in front of little kids
now im drinking in the middle of the day
well those things happen sometimes
beat i mean they shouldnt happen all the time but
its the price of uh truly living life
isnt that like a slogan for some kind of beer or toothpaste or something
and its true you and me were not just some boring couple in the suburbs who dont sleep with each other and have nothing to talk about except whatever tv
show theyre currently into
beat we like
still know how to party
beat i think i need to slow down
beat and i might need help
ill help you
i know but
i might need more help
like a therapist
i dont know i just get stupid when im drunk and im drunk a lot
we just like to have a good time
beat youve gotta promise not to tell this to anyone
curious i promise
that includes owen
well last night i kinda um
hushed smoked some crack
some bar patrons glance at kate and charlie
after i left the bar i uh picked up this drunk girl and
i dont really remember what came next but i ended up smoking crack with her
hows that even happen
beat you give someone a ride and she rewards you with crack
she seemed desperate
she really needed a ride home
i think she maybe lives in
she might be homeless
or a prostitute
or just some lost sorority girl
thinks about it to be honest im not sure
disgusted oh my god
you smoked crack with some random stranger
share a pipe
kate doesnt answer
she doesnt need to
beat just playing devils advocate but maybe its the crack smoking you need help with and not the drinking
kate gives charlie a dirty look
im just saying
the drinking led to the crack smoking
the drinking leads to everything stupid i do
beat i mean
can you even remember the last time we had sober sex
charlie begins to answer but then
he tries to remember
well chill out with the booze for a while
we can just be wine with dinner people
beat hows that sound
kate and charlie joyfully ride bicycles home from the bar
maybe you should go to uh
one of those meetings
they have em over there
charlie gestures to a building could be a church or different type of building where aa meets
remember when i was shit faced and took that q a pamphlet from there
laughs holy shit
and we answered yes to like every question and at the end it was like if you answered yes to any of these youre an alcoholic
nostalgic that was fun wasnt it
kate smiles and nods
hey charlie gestures to the street
look out for that crack
kate looks down but sees nothing
oh sorry i thought there was a crack there
grins but you must have smoked it last night
kate rolls her eyes and then jokingly swerves towards charlie trying to knock him over
he laughs and speeds away
kate chases after him
while an old s r b song plays on a record player which is next to stacks and stacks of records kate and charlie drunkenly slow dance drink wine and
laugh at an aa pamphlet
have you missed days of work or school because of drinking
do you envy people who can drink without getting into trouble
envy isnt exactly the right word
do you have blackouts
yeah but who doesnt
has your drinking caused trouble at home
but we still had a lot of yes answers
refers to pamphlet yep
we still qualify as drunks
im gonna go
disbelief yeah right
no im serious
im gonna go
what time is it
kate gets up
doesnt believe her uh huh
kate takes a big sip of wine
quite serious this is me going
charlie laughs he doesnt buy it
youve been boozing
you should come too
you cant go to aa wasted
its like a rule or something
an aa meeting is in progress
an older woman stands at the podium sharing her story
the room is filled with different groups of people all of whom sit with their own group like a high school lunch room but the people are adults
there are distinct groups of and hipsters
as kate whos slightly confused enters the building a hip looking man donovan s stops her extending his hand
whispers hey im donovan
hi donovan im kate
donovan shushes kate
you must be a newcomer huh
whispers um im not really allowed to talk to new chicks but there are lots of women here who can help you out
beat do i just sit wherever
the meeting already started so just try to find a spot anywhere
kate drunkenly stumbles to the back of the room saying things like sorry and i like that jacket as she takes a seat next to two very clean cut women
as the woman at the podium continues to speak the women next to kate quietly try to welcome her
are you new
whys everyone whispering
its hard huh
everythings going to be fine
kate doesnt respond just looks around with the fear anyone would have if they felt they had just accidentally joined jim jones church
the room is completely full with over one hundred people
the tattooed man stands at the podium
not to embarrass anyone but so that we may get to know you better is there anybody here in their first thirty days of recovery
several people scattered throughout the room stand up and introduce themselves as alcoholics
kate stands up
i guess im a little drunk right now
people burst into laughter
do you want me to talk about my childhood or something
painfully polite you know kate we actually ask that you dont share if youve had a drink or any mind altering substance in the past hours
not listening i can i kinda hate my dad and dont talk to him
and my mom
i dont even know where to start
shes like stuck in the s and kind of a metalhead
her last boyfriend called himself a drummer but really just gave drum lessons to little kids and tries to shut kate up welcome kate
forces a smile it gets better
not picking up the hint i like drinking is the thing
i mean i dont want to say you guys are wrong or anything
kate nervously laughs
some of the people in the crowd look embarrassed for kate
thank you were all here to help
we do have to move on though
the woman next to kate gets her to sit back down
dont worry sweetie therell be plenty of time to tell your story
a young woman amber approaches the podium
hey im amber alcoholic
i cant really believe that its been five years
i mean my life was a mess back then
now im back in school i have an amazing man i love my parents its crazy
way too loud how old is that girl
can she even go to bars
to amber how old are you amber
kate seems surprised at being chastised
gaining intensity um
its because i did the work
i got down on my knees and prayed every night
i went to a meeting everyday
it wasnt easy but ive gotta say i owe everything to aa
well aa and god of course
the whole room applauds
everyone is standing holding hands and saying the serenity god grant me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change courage to change the things i can and wisdom
to know the difference
everyone turns and looks at kate
i think im good
kate quickly leaves the meeting as clumsily as she arrived
kate chugs frozen margarita straight from a pitcher
so much for that
kate and charlie stand in their backyard which is criss crossed by white christmas lights and has some old lawn they drunkenly play croquet
was it a bunch of old biker guys
no it was
i dont know
a lot of really enthusiastic people
yuck i hate enthusiasm
im sorry it wasnt cool
charlie thinks for a moment
i cant really imagine never drinking
i guess i dont have to though beat youre the one with the problem
kate nods in agreement
hey i love you
i dont want you to have to drink
i dont have to drink
beat i just really like to drink
sincere good cause youre my favorite person to drink with in the whole damn world
charlie leans in to kiss kate
they make out for a moment and then kate
bites charlies lip
charlie pulls back shocked
kate grins mischievously
oh no you didnt
charlie lunges at kate who dodges him and laughs
charlie dives and playfully tackles kate
they begin to wrestle in the grass its cute and loving but perhaps a little too intense
kate and charlie are making out on the bed
kate starts to unbutton charlies shirt
as it turns out charlies extremely drunk and its apparent in his movements and voice
are you trying to have some sex
kate removes charlies pants and takes off her clothing
she climbs on top of him and they start having sloppy drunk sex
after a few beats kate notices that charlie isnt moving
she looks down to discover that hes passed out
kate pauses for a moment
then continues to ride her unconscious husband
kate drinks whats left in the tequila bottle as she drunkenly searches the fridge counter and cupboard for more booze
she finds a few sips here and there at the bottom of a couple beer bottles but she seems frustrated that there isnt more alcohol in the house
kate puts on her slippers robe and kate drunkenly rides a bicycle down the street still in her robe and slippers
kate tries to open the locked glass fridge where the beer is kept
after several attempts she gives up and grabs two bottles of wine from a shelf
kate sets the bottles on the counter
the clerk a tired looking man in his s looks at kate with pity
you know i cant sell you this kate
an elderly man shopping for frozen food glances over at kate
you cant tell im
come on im in here all the time
you know me
yes i do kate
and i know youre old enough but its too late
the clerk holds up his watch which reads
cmon we can just pretend its before two
kate reaches down and tries to rewind the clerks watch
not amused stop it
its just a little wine
im not driving or anything
i dont think so
kate gives him a big flirty smile
come on dude ill let you have a sip if you want
kate tries to do a sexy dance
its the law
i cant sell alcohol after a
you know that
why dont you give it to me then
that wouldnt hurt anything
a gift because were friends
i could lose my job
kate doesnt have anything to say back so she glances at the elderly man in the frozen food section
to the elderly man meant to be a whisper but way too loud you distract him okay
the elderly man puts up his hands not wanting any part of it
look why dont you get a bottle of water or a coffee or something instead
water or coffee
what just cause i wont suck your dick
had enough oh my god
okay enough you gotta go
kate doesnt budge
you should go
kate is hysterical and her eyes are starting to fill with tears
this is bullshit
beat i have to pee
kate runs down the aisle and tries to open the bathroom door but its locked
she hides from view and then squats down and begins to pull up her robe
what the fuck are you doing
caught i didnt mean to
sometimes i just have to pee really really bad
frustrated get outta here now
cant we drink together
the clerk clearly isnt going to budge
kate nods resigned and then
grabs a bottle of wine and dashes out the door
kate is passed out on the concrete bank of the los angeles river
the empty bottle of screw top wine is next to her
kates bicycle lays in some weeds nearby
a bird squawks
kate slowly wakes up confused and in a zombie like state she gets up and trudges home wheeling along her bike
kate is awakened by the deafeningly loud alarm clock and the sound of a news radio announcer
she looks at the clock and realizes that its
she jumps out of bed in a panic
kate pauses when she realizes her back is wet
she looks down at the bed which is
mumbled not again
half asleep charlie rolls over onto the pee soaked part of the bed
come back to bed baby
i have to go to work
you snoozed my alarm again
im gonna be late
well you peed on me so i guess were even
i have a weak bladder
i cant go to work like this
you work from our kitchen
yeah but changing the sheets is my real job
beat hey where were you last night
i woke up at like a
and you were gone
where would i go at a
you mustve been dreaming
kate then glances down and notices that her feet are covered in dirt and grass
she pauses slightly alarmed but continues getting ready
kates on her knees puking into a toilet
kate exits the stall to find principal barnes standing by the door
i can only imagine the chemistry experiment thats going on barnes points at kates stomach
smiles in there
kate sits on a small chair reading a childrens book to her class whore sitting indian style in a semi circle
are you gonna have a boy or a girl
i dont know yet
when will you know
not until summertime
you guys will be on vacation
if you have a boy what will you name him
thats a name for a man not a baby
the children laugh
kate laughs too but looks a little freaked out
kate eats her packed lunch with mr
thanks again for covering for me
i cant promise to cover for you every time you get pregnant
there wont be another time
i genuinely hope not
look i didnt tell barnes but if anything like this happens again ill have to
davies smiles a sweet genuine smile
not sure what to say david
kate tries to hold back a smile
i know dave davies
anyway uh is everything okay with you
i dont know
i puked in front of my class and then told everyone im pregnant
thats not really okay huh
no i dont think so
i went to aa last night
slightly uncomfortable oh yeah
whatd you think of it
it was awful
i kept getting shushed
i dont normally tell people i work with this
davies takes a coin that says nine years out of his pocket and shows it to kate
im a bit of an expert when it comes to these things
ive lived a strange one
im nine years sober aa and na
beat i used to drink cocaine
off kates shocked expression its really cheap in the philippines
davies takes a beat to think about what hes saying
i know meetings can be weird
especially at first but if you want to
you never need to feel like you have to
but the ones i go to are pretty small
nice little groups
beat id be happy to take you
maybe that would be good
i dont know
no pressure okay
that shit saved my life though
principal barnes walks in
switching gears well im scheduled to observe ms
carols art class
theyre making macaroni art so
im pretty stoked
davies gets up to leave discretely winking at kate as he exits
principal barnes watches mr
davies leave a puzzled expression on her face
to kate mrs
hannah ive got something for you
principal barnes opens the mini fridge to reveal a huge jug of orange juice
you need it now like never before
i bet your mother is over the moon huh
probably planning you a baby shower
she and i arent that close
oh im sorry
well listen any motherly thing you need im here okay
barnes hands kate a large glass of juice
now drink up that baby in theres thirsty
takes a sip of orange juice and
youre kinda the only person at school besides mr
davies who knows im pregnant
my lips are principal barnes mimes zipping her lips
kate walks in the front door to see charlie working on his computer
a beer next to him
an old record plays on the record player
kate collapses on the couch next to charlie and kisses him
how was your day
and whats that smell
couldnt find oatmeal so i made ketchup soup
you need to eat
im going to see that band from iceland with the triplets play tonight
want to come with me and owen to check it out
oh that sounds fun but
cmon owen cant pick up girls without you
i dont know
this guy i work with mr
davies the vice principal
yeah turns out hes sober and invited me to a meeting
surprised wow thats
charlie goes silent
nothing i just
i didnt think you really loved the meeting you went to yesterday
in fact it sounded like you hated it
so im kinda surprised youre going back
this is a smaller meeting
it might be different
i dunno i think i want to give it a fair shot
besides i was hammered last night
beat go on and have fun out drinking with owen tonight
im just gonna you know try something different
charlie pulls kate close to him
im here for you okay
even though i drink i could slow down if you need me to
forces a smile im sure i could
kate approaches a small church
davies waits outside
davies walks kate into a medium sized room where about ten people are getting coffee talking and setting kate looks around the room scoping out the people whore very different
from the crowd at the previous nights meeting several blue collar men jenny ish with dark hair and a confident sort of tough demeanor a few older people and a young couple
davies directs kate over to a table with coffee and this is a little more my speed
no one here is the slightest bit hip
does everybody just
kinda you know talk here
someone leads tells their story
and then everyone else shares talks
so since youre taking me here does that make you my sponsor
no i dont think i could do that
off kates expression cause um
nervously searches well it could get weird
but ill help you find one if you want
gestures to the seats we should sit down
kate looks around the room at everyone taking their seats
takes a deep breath to mr
davies i cant believe im really here
it gets better
weirder maybe but better
the meeting has begun and everyone sits in a circle of chairs
jenny is midway through her speech
all i knew about taking care of myself was fucking people over and lying to get by
i had no idea how to even look for a normal job or pay my bills on time or pay my fucking bills at all
beat now i pay my bills online
the group chuckles
and i found a love in cooking
ive got my own catering business now
maybe i just replaced alcohol with chocolate chips and cigarettes but still
its been years since i woke up in a park in a different state
kate leans in towards mr
davies and whispers
i kinda like her
get her number at break
i feel like youre my wingman
kate grins at mr
davies who smiles shyly and glances away
an older man arlo stands and announces
therell now be a ten minute break
smoke em if you got em
as some of the people go outside kate walks over to jenny whos getting a cup of coffee
hey i liked your speech
all that dumb shit happened so im glad that now its at least entertaining
beat whats your name
this is my first meeting
first meeting where im not wasted
oh yeah i remember doing some of that
i dont really know how this stuff works
could i get your number
i mean i may not need it but
yeah of course
i can help explain it to you and also we can just talk
beat youve been sober since you were
that seems really young
i didnt have much of a choice i crashed my car into a nursing home
beat i think the break is just about over
this meeting is the kind where everyone can share
sharing always helps me so
if its not too weird try introducing yourself and telling the group whats going on
everyone is sitting down and sharing
the woman tina next to kate is finishing up
anyway thats where im at today
thanks for listening
everyone looks at kate
im kate and
long beat im an alcoholic
kate nervously laughs
i dont mean to laugh its just saying those words
beat i think im an alcoholic but i dont really know
i drink a lot
ive always drank
everyone i know drinks a lot
i never really thought i had a problem lately though it seems like maybe i do
i just want to be able to drink a beer without it turning into twenty or wetting my bed
beat it seems like every time i drink something awful happens
all the shit that i used to laugh off isnt really funny anymore
the dumb drunk stuff has gone from embarrassing to scary
beat im kinda
looks around self consciously
a series of short quick scenes kate sits at her desk grading papers
kates hand has an uncontrollable tremble as she tries to carefully make red checks on students papers
self consciously she steadies her right hand with her left
kate shovels chocolate chips from the bag into her mouth while driving
kate is at a meeting talking to jenny
while kate and charlie eat dinner kate drinks water but focuses on charlies glass of wine and the slow careful sips he takes
charlie and owen play video games and laugh while kate tries to concentrate on a book but is clearly distracted by how loud the guys are
charlie sleeps on the other side of the bed as kate writes in a notebook
kate stops writing
she stares at charlie as he sleeps
kate rides her bicycle hard
it might even be
how about ninety days
everyone is dressed differently some people have different hair cuts etc
davies stands up holding a plastic case
is there anyone here who has ninety days of continuous sobriety
kate stands up she looks way more together than she did earlier
she gives mr
davies a hug and he hands her a im kate
im an alcoholic
kate sits down next to jenny and gives her a hug
kate who eats a piece of cake sits on a patio with jenny mr
davies and several other people from aa
im really proud of you kate
i kinda cant believe its been ninety days
beat the longest ive gone since high school without drinking was like a week
my first three months were such hell
i think im only sober today because i just never want to go through that again
its weird in after school specials the getting sober part was only like a minute of the movie and suddenly
daddys all okay
several people laugh
but its so fucking hard and weird and suddenly i have all these other problems now that drinking isnt the problem
work my non existent relationship with my mom
when was the last time you saw her
tries to remember a year at least
maybe its time
beat and then theres my marriage
i mean charlies great
really great hes supportive especially at first
its strange though
i feel like alcohol was the thing that connected us and now that i dont drink we lead these two very different lives
beat we havent slept together in forever
laughs i havent pissed myself in awhile though
so thats good
it takes time
kate gives an exasperated look
half stern cheerleader tone keep working the steps
glances at her watch lets grab coffee tomorrow okay
i should actually run you home now and come back
i need to start locking up
i could stick around and help you
to kate i could take you home
off kates reaction if you want
davies pulls up to kates house
my ex wife she doesnt drink well not like us but as soon as i got sober i started to change and she just
i didnt know you were married
yeah i was married once laughs in my other life
but i shouldnt be talking to you about this stuff
i dont know
because youre a dude we cant talk
i dont get that men stick with men women stick with women stuff
well if you were sitting where im sitting youd understand
are you trying to tell me that you have a crush on me
what am i one of your students
long beat i kind of do yes
i have a crush on you
i know thats wrong youre newly sober and married and i shouldnt be thinking about you like that
but yeah i should put that out on the table
i think youre a really good guy
oh great good guys are the nerds that carry the pretty girls books
i think youre beautiful
kate smiles bashfully
and smart and sexy and cool
davies moves slightly closer to kate
and i know its wrong but in meetings i stare at your lips and your legs and all i can think about is fucking your moist pussy
kate jumps back aghast
off kates horrified expression oh crap
i dont know why i just said that
im really really sorry
genuinely sorry oh that was a bad thing to say right
im so so sorry
im just confused and i dont know how to talk to women jesus you cant just go around telling people you want to fuck their moist pussy
beat who even says that
im really sorry
kate gets out of the car slams the door shut then leans in to say i have to go inside my house where i live with my husband
beat thanks for your creepy version of honesty
kate lies in bed and appears slightly bored as charlie is under the covers going down on kate
from under the covers yep im just pacing myself
the tortoise wins the race
actually im not really in the mood
but i wanted to give you a days gift
its okay the days was the gift
sorry if i was doing a bad job im kinda hammered
long beat i miss you
charlie comes up from under the covers and looks a bit tipsy
i dont know
i dont really feel connected to you anymore
did i do something
beat we dont talk that much
we used to talk but now you come home and go to meetings and by the time you get back im kinda drunk
i was gonna say tired
theres some stuff i need to do this weekend
i think im gonna go up to lake arrowhead
to see your mom
defensive do i need a reason
with your mom
beat is this the amends step
well then whyre you going
beat we send her checks
but we never actually see her
sometimes it feels like im paying her to not be in my life
i thought it would be nice to visit her
beat and jenny thinks it would be a good idea
i dont know
i mean do you do everything your sponsor tells you to do
do you think im brainwashed or something
its been a long damn time since youve seen your mom
beat and you didnt listen when i suggested we visit her
suddenly gets that its an ego thing for charlie oh baby i listen to you
it felt like the right time
beat with all the changes im going through
well can i come with you
itll be like a little vacation
i think i should go alone
come on if you do that youll just get depressed
if i go we can try to make it fun
go hiking and stuff
well if you go dont take this the wrong way but id like it if maybe you didnt drink
beat just while were there
smiles i think i can handle not drinking for like a day
kate smiles and snuggles up into charlies arms
kate and charlie drive and listen to music
kate and charlie are parked in front of a house
a little run down
sort of a vague ski cabin look
theres some dirty lawn furniture in the front yard as well as a dozen lawn gnomes
the lawn gnomes
i missed those guys
kate playfully punches charlie in the shoulder
waving to a lawn gnome hi holger
we gonna go in
charlie glances at kate and reads the anxiety on her face
kate and charlie walk to the front door
unsettled i shouldve brought something
something you know
definitely not that
they get to the door
charlie looks at kate who seems like shed be okay if they ran back to the car
conceding go on
under her breath oh god
the door opens revealing rochelle late s wears an old shredded heavy metal band t shirt and tight ripped up jeans looks like she enjoys an afternoon drink or three
rochelle wraps her arms around kate
whatre you doing here
i left you a message mom
oh you know i dont check that thing
notices charlie slightly flirty hello there young man
beat what a lovely surprise you two came to visit
hell has frozen over
laughs just kidding
come inside let me fix you both some drinks
just water for me
rochelle laughs as she leads the way
kate glances at charlie she already seems slightly annoyed
kate and charlie sit down
the place is a mess
magazines and junkmail everywhere
too much furniture thrown together in a chaotic manner
the walls are covered with framed heavy metal band posters and there are ashtrays everywhere filled to the brim with cigarette butts
you wouldnt believe how much the neighborhoods changed
baker passed away and the kids put mrs
baker in a home the people that moved in oof
rochelle walks in holding a tray with three gin and tonics
its like they dont even understand the concept of birth control in their country
rochelle hands charlie a glass and then goes to kate and puts a drink on the table in front of her
confides if you ask me i think its a meth house
beat theyve always got those little five year old twins playing in the yard but im pretty sure theyre the lookouts
thats pretty wild mom
notices that kate hasnt touched her drink whats wrong honey
think i forgot how to mix em
i told you i just wanted water
where im from no means yes
to charlie am i right or am i right
forcing it huh huh
thats actually why i wanted to come up mom
beat i stopped drinking
rochelle laughs then realizes kate and charlie arent joking
quickly serious are you telling me im going to be a grandma
rochelle tears up with joy
oh thats so exciting
im gonna be a grandma
to charlie and you know that no drinking when youre pregnant thing is just a myth
i drank plenty when i was pregnant with kate and look how she turned out
im not pregnant mom
i just needed a break
im sober for the first time in years
dismissive well see how long that lasts
its been a while actually
chimes in days
to kate youve sure picked the right partner gestures to charlie for this little mission
defensive hey im not drinking either
to charlie slightly annoyed drink if you want to charlie
to rochelle charlie didnt stop drinking
im doing it by myself
i started going to step meetings
rochelle looks slightly disgusted
to charlie katies father went to those meetings a few years after we got married
you can see how well that worked out for me
rochelle gestures to her living room i raised his daughter in this palace while hes somewhere in florida with his shiny new wife and kids
long beat to charlie you better be careful they change
kate and charlie exchange a glance
i thought youd be happy for me mom
im sorry im not being a good hostess am i
rochelle gets up takes the drink away from kate and chugs it
ill microwave you your favorite
charlie kate and rochelle watch a reality tv show while eating
rochelle rests her head on kates shoulder
im sorry if i acted like a bitch
its okay mom
i know you cant help it
kate and charlie wander around santas village an abandoned christmas themed amusement park with giant ginger bread houses plastic christmas trees etc
in the middle of the woods
creepy and nostalgic at the same time
looks like the set of a christmas horror film
kate holds charlies hand as she leads him around
this place shut down a decade ago and then there was a fire and now its basically abandoned
charlie seems totally impressed by the weirdness of the place
we came here every year the week before christmas
and then i worked here in high school selling hot chocolate
and they had real reindeer too
they kept em over there
kate points at the remains of a pen
my mom worked here when she was younger
i think everyone who grew up around here worked at santas village at some point
charlie just nods and listens hes in awe of this place
this is what i think of when i think of christmas
long beat thanks for coming up here with me
im sorry my moms so awful
shrugs she just cant handle her liquor
kate and charlie look in each others eyes
seem to have a moment
and then charlie asks did you ever hook up with guys when you worked here
you know sneak off with a co worker and do it against a pine tree or something
i mean if i were a teenage boy working with a stone cold fox like you id totally want to hook up with you here
in the ginger bread house
charlie puts his arms around kate
you were probably the coolest girl in town and the prettiest
im sure everyone was in love with you
kate walks in to her class to find a group of teachers including principal barnes and mr
davies standing in the room which has been decked out for a i couldnt keep quiet
i just had to tell everyone so we could celebrate
you shouldnt have
you dont have to thank me just open your presents
kate looks at her desk which is stacked with presents wrapped in pink and baby blue wrapping paper
theres also a cake
youre gonna love what i got you
is it a boy or a girl
kate opens a present a mobile
seems nauseous oh its so
enthusiastic its to hang over the crib
montage kate opens presents while the teachers clap
eventually kate begins to cry which everyone assumes are tears of joy
principal barnes takes a bite of cake
its so moist
kate glances at mr
davies who cringes
kate walks to her car
kate looks back to see mr
davies running over but she doesnt reply or slow down
listen i am so so sorry
you have no idea how much this has been eating me up
what you said to me was really fucked up
what were you even thinking
i wasnt i was just
i try to be really honest
i get that
but you cant force your honesty on everyone you know
he looks really embarrassed
changing tone im flattered that you have
feelings for me
but im married
ill apologize to your husband if you want
no you dont have to do that
i didnt even tell him
you cant say that to a girl like ever
consider that a rule of thumb
beat someday youre gonna meet a nice available lady but if you say moist pussy to her you will never ever ever get to see that part of her body
even more embarrassed okay
beat thank you
nods i feel like this was a really good talk
kate forces a smile
kate stares at a half eaten birthday cake owen is still sort of legible on the kitchen table
its totally mutilated
she walks out the back door into the where she finds charlie owen and one of owens friends listening to loud music while they play foosball
theyre all shit housed
getting married would fucking suck
i cant even imagine waking up to the same person for the rest of my life
kate walks out
whats up kate
i see you guys found the birthday cake jenny and i baked
you should get a slice
to charlie i uh
kinda thought wed all eat it together
baby i didnt even think about that
it was really good
we have plenty of tequila to make up for the cake
kates in aa so she cant drink
she hasnt drank in forever like thirty eight days or some shit
ninety five days actually
do you still smoke weed
no i wasnt a big weed smoker anyway
you smoked crack though didnt you
kates face goes blank
she stares at charlie
shit i hear crack gets you so high
no my wife doesnt smoke crack
im joking around
i know kates not a crackhead or some shit
to kate it was just that one time right
angry to charlie thanks charlie
kate storms out of the room
to owen its your birthday man so im not gonna make a big deal out of this but you need to shut the fuck up sometimes
charlie walks in to see kate getting ready to go to bed
listen im sorry
im not mad at him im mad at you
you said you wouldnt tell anyone about what i did
was drunk too when i told him
beat why dont you guys just go to the bar now
you wanna come
im hanging here
im sure they have near beer baby
itll be fun
im staying in
that sounds like a lot of fun
i love you
kate doesnt say a word
i love you
long beat i love you too
kate stands at the blackboard teaching addition and subtraction to the class
a little girl isabel raises her hand
hannah shouldnt you be more fatter
cause of the baby
my mom got real fat
taken off guard well
shouldnt you be fatter
is the correct way to ask that question
kate goes back to the board clearly wanting to move on
now one day when youre very old and wise fourth graders youll learn about multiplication and mrs
hannah shouldnt you be more fat
all the students look at kate
shes on the spot
kate searches for something to say
but then she blurts im not going to have a baby
kate immediately looks like she wishes she could take it back
see i was pregnant but it wasnt my time i suppose
another little girl winnie jumps in
hannah did you kill the baby
no of course not
cause my mom says that when you kill a baby you go to hell and you cant even go to church to ask god for forgiveness
the students begin to whisper to each other
another boy toby asks mrs
hannah are you going to hell
i didnt kill my baby
okay listen kids we shouldnt be talking about this
beat sometimes women get pregnant and then early on before its even a baby they stop being pregnant
because a doctor murders it
no not because a doctor murdered it
beat its called a miscarriage
that means it wasnt my plan its just what happened
composes herself does anyone want to ask me any questions
the class nods but seems silently freaked out
lets get back to subtraction or addition
kate sits with mr
davies eating lunch
well that was bound to happen at some point
kids notice things like that
but i had no idea how pro life little winnie reddy is
beat remind me to wear my may the fetus you save be gay t shirt to the next banana split night
kate half laughs
and just think the kids got a lesson about life and death that nobody planned on
i mean youre years ahead of the standard curriculum for uh third graders
does it matter that i lied
that i was never pregnant
you want me to answer that as a friend or as someone who takes the twelve steps very seriously
well the good thing is that its all over now
principal barnes will think youre a martyr for losing a baby
beat the kids wont ask about it anymore and as long as you dont toss your cookies again you wont have to deal with it
long beat and the bad news
to your boss and a bunch of small children
who trust you
and rely on you to help them differentiate right from wrong
slowly nods thats all huh
kate and charlie eat take out food in silence
kate texts on her cell phone not even paying attention to charlie
i gotta say this is the boringest meal ive had in about as long as i can remember
kate doesnt look up
whore you texting
still looking down jenny
shes like a parole officer
shes my sponsor
im glad to know every little fuck up i have is gonna become a topic of conversation with some chick i dont even know
kate finishes her text
puts down her phone
fake enthusiasm so
whatd you do today honey
i finished some writing and met up with owen to watch the game and toss a few back
beat you do anything special
i lied to my class again
i told them that i had a miscarriage
thats not funny
yeah it is
telling kids fucked up stuff is totally funny
in you know a kinda fucked up way
great well im glad im not actually having a baby
god kate come on
what else were you supposed to do
well i feel like a piece of shit for lying
its not that big a deal
is this what those meetings teach you
to make drama out of nothing
its not nothing
i lied to little kids and to my boss because i cant take responsibility for my actions
why dont you go and tell the principal that you were never pregnant
that the reason you puked is because you smoked crack all night
would you feel better about yourself then
ive been thinking about doing that actually
thinks about it yeah
i think i would feel better about myself
do it then
i guess you dont need a job
i could be like you i could stay home drinking all day and never do anything responsible
hurt i never do anything responsible
what about buying this house that we live in
or the food that were eating
having rich parents doesnt make you responsible
i think its pretty much done the opposite
charlie looks stunned
oh im sorry that i have a family that supports us and not the other way around
what the fuck is that supposed to mean
but you cant be mad at me because my family has helped us out
you should be grateful we dont have to struggle
i wouldnt care if we struggled with money
ive struggled with money my whole life
beat id rather worry about where my next meal is coming from than if i in some drunken stupor married a man who just wants to party and meet bands
what the fuck are you talking about
im talking about you being a baby
a selfish baby
you know what
i fucking hate aa
it turned you into a bitch
a brain washed bitch
at least im not drunk all the time
yeah you dont drink booze for three months and suddenly youre some saint
you have it all together and im just a baby
kate doesnt answer
im trying kate
im trying to understand you
but its hard
youre different and maybe its good that youre different
maybe im bad and bad for you or something because i didnt think the person you were before was so awful
i loved that person
yeah she drank a lot and she did some silly things
but she was my kate
you loved that person
do you not love me now
yeah of course
but its different
before i was a mess
beat im finally getting my life together and you loved me more before
charlie looks at the floor
soft kinda yeah
charlie looks like he immediately regrets what he said
kate follows jenny from her patio to her kitchen as she cleans up
i feel so fucking weird right now charlie doesnt love me like he used to and ive lied to my students multiple times
beat i just dont feel
normal right now
well youre not normal
beat none of us are
everything in life isnt connected to being an alcoholic
im not just talking about alcoholics
beat people are fucking weird
we all have a lot of shit we carry around in our heads that doesnt make sense
beat at least alcoholics have tools to work through it
yeah steps and talking and listening and crying
i have the crying part covered
i know right
i think my first year i cried tears id been saving since i was eight
beat its hard to live your life
any idea what youre gonna do about your school situation
what youre gonna say
kate shakes her head
i dont know what im gonna do about anything
you wanna stay in my guest room tonight
you can watch movies get some good sleep
you sure thats okay
yeah of course
thats why i spent money on a guest bed so people could sleep in it
beat i know it might feel like it but really you dont have to figure everything out tonight
smiles youve got time
kate goes into her classroom and finds a note on the desk
principal barnes hugs kate
im so sorry kate
beat i havent told many people this but when i was young younger than you
i lost a child too
looks like she feels terrible
im really sorry
it was a long long time ago
still hurts sometimes
you move on
you have to
beat have a seat
kate sits down
i got a phone call from a very upset parent
thats how i found out about
frankly im not sure why you didnt feel like you could tell me
i freaked out a student asked why i wasnt fat and i just froze up and then another student was saying i killed my baby and i didnt know what
im not angry with you but i need to be clear that this doesnt happen again
i promise that
by not happening again i mean that you dont discuss any controversial topics things the school board deems family matters with your class
beat no sex
no drugs and alcohol
kate straightens up in her seat takes a deep breath
i cant keep doing this
i feel awful
confused i know this all must be hard for you no
you dont understand
beat i have to be honest with you
what do you mean
i wasnt ever pregnant
principal barnes looks shocked
i lied to the class and to you because i was scared
you vomited in class
and when that happened i didnt know what to do because the truth is oh my god are you really ill
is it cancer
no well yes
i have a disease but um
beat its alcoholism
principal barnes goes from concerned to angry
ive been working on it
im one hundred days sober
when that happened id been out drinking and was hung over and you vomited in front of children because you were hung over
and lied saying that you were pregnant
well a student asked if i was pregnant and yes just kind of fell out of my mouth
principal barnes looks disgusted
thats sick kate
no i dont think you understand how wrong that is
to lie to me to the children
you know i felt so terrible for you when i found out that you had a mis
beat how can you play with peoples emotions like that
i was sick
you told us you had a miscarriage
i threw you a baby shower
im really sorry
ive been wanting to tell you the truth because honesty has become really important to me
im in aa now and doing the steps and working with a sponsor and everything
beat its really hard
i mean i think my husband might hate me and im sorry but what you did is totally irresponsible
beat i cant have you here anymore
surprised am i being fired
no no the state wouldnt allow that without a report
im not going to write a report
because frankly i have no idea what that report would say
beat but im forcing you to take a leave of absence and i think its in your best interest if you find a job elsewhere
listen im really sorry but im doing the right things now
i believe you or i want to
i really do
but honey i believed you before
beat ill have a sub take over your class starting tomorrow
its late enough in the year that we can just say youre having personal problems principal barnes looks at kate
which seems to be the truth
principal barnes not another word
im upset right now very upset and i think im doing you a favor by not reporting you
kate struggles to say something to try to explain herself but no words come out until she musters thank you
kate stands defeated and leaves the principals office
kate glumly marches down the stairs holding a box filled with some of her things including the baby shower gifts
davies stops her
kate whats going on
i told principal barnes about everything
did you tell her about
davies gestures to kates crotch
gets it oh god no
i told her that im an alcoholic
and that i lied
and she fired me
but concerned too my god kate im sorry
ive been going to aa and trying to be sober and this is what it got me
beat fired for telling the truth
davies awkwardly puts his arm around kates shoulder
i wish there was something i could do
im a fuck up
ill always be a fuck up
im just like my mom
confused no no youre a wonderful smart woman kate
you cant let this get you down
i gotta go
davies takes kates box of things from her
let me walk you to your car
kate throws her arms around mr
davies and begins to full on sob
davies seems flustered and a little scared but tries to comfort kate
kate cries as she drives
she glances in the backseat at all the baby shower gifts and sobs even harder
kate walks into a near empty depressing dive
she nervously sits at the bar
the bartender a gruff looking guy with the sleeves rolled up approaches
what do you need
the bartender gives kate her drink
kate immediately downs it
can i have another one
sure you gotta pay for the first one though
kate puts a twenty dollar bill down
the bartender pours her another shot
kate has clearly been drinking for awhile shes curled up at the bar nursing her beer
look miss i dont wanna be a downer or anything cause i take it youve had a bad day but um
i think you need to go home
cause youre pretty drunk and its four p
what about him
kate points to an old crusty man at the other end of the bar
youre not kicking him out
im just trying to be a pal
stop it you arent my pal
i just got fired and i just quit aa
beat it didnt work
you know what
i was fine had a husband that loved me and maybe i sometimes did embarrassing stuff but it was a phase
i go to aa and sober my husband and i start fighting and stop fucking and sober i get fired
isnt that whats supposed to not happen
wow okay well
im real sorry
but this place gets a little nuts after sundown and i dont think a pretty girl who just left aa should be here
beat im gonna call you a cab
i dont want a cab
i want glances around drugs
can you hook me up
the bartender rolls his eyes
lets go out back and smoke some crack
lady youre done
you think im above smoking crack
cause im not
and are you really gonna tell me youre not a little attracted to me
kate leans across the bar trying to look seductive but she just looks like she might fall off her bar stool
just a teensy bit
not in the slightest
you might want to consider investing in glasses buddy
cause im a
a stone cold fox
and im smart
kate begins to cry
a good person
i think its time for you to go home
now are you gonna let me call a cab
suddenly angry no
ive got friends
theyll pick me up
you do that
ill call mr
he has dreams about me
the bartender takes a long look at kate as though hes trying to size up if shes insane
hope that works out for you
cant believe my luck
i just want to get drunk and a bartender wont let me
beat life is stupid
kate stands up almost falling over and glares at the bartender
you hear me
life is fucking kate goes over to the old man at the end of bar winks at him then picks up his drink and chugs it
kate is slumped in the back seat
in the front seat is mr
davies and jenny
i called you
whyd you bring her
were worried about you kate
accusing parole officer
shes your sponsor
its gonna be okay
youll get back up
how bout we drive to mexico and party our asses off
jenny and dave glance back at kate whose face reveals what a bad state shes in
holding back tears sounds fucking stupendous right
kate gets out of the car
davies and jenny watch with concerned expressions as kate stumbles to her front door
are you sure youre over her shoulder fuck off
charlie plays a video game with the tv hooked up through his stereo speakers
kate opens the doors and walks in wobbly
not looking up babe you gotta hear this with the speakers hooked up
kate says nothing
just stares at charlie
charlie looks up and is surprised to see kate clearly drunk
what happened to you
charlie stops playing the game
im fired from my job
we got any drinks
we have soda
i can make coffee
dont be cute with me
you know what i mean
i guess you arent doing the aa thing anymore
what gave that away
kate turns and goes to the kitchen reappearing a moment later with a bottle of tequila salt and limes
come on baby lets do some shots
whats going on
what the fuck does it look like
kate takes a shot
are you gonna be a little girl or are you gonna drink with me
i dont know what the right thing to do here is
okay so let me see if this makes sense you say you miss the old kate the kate who drinks and blacks out and has fun
here she is
kate smiles but she looks more desperate and drunk than fun
baby i didnt mean that
i was just being a jerk
fuck yeah you were
now you wont drink with me
i dont know
having a beer or something is one thing but
i think you really may have a problem
well thanks for all the support when i was trying to be sober
kate takes another shot
i didnt realize of course you didnt realize
you dont fucking care about me
what are you talking about
of course i care about you
i love you
kate takes a shot and approaches charlie
i love you too
love is the easy part
its the rest of the shit thats hard
kate kisses charlie
take off your pants
charlie gently pushes kate away
look i think you should get to sleep
youre really wasted
i dont wanna sleep
i wanna fuck
kate pulls charlie who struggles down to the couch
and straddles him
please will you stop
i want you to fuck me
charlie calmly tries to move kate off of him
this is weird
be a man and fuck your wife
charlie whos creeped out now forcefully pushes kate off
jesus what the fuck is wrong with you
kate has become quite angry and belligerent by this point and begins picking up household objects and throwing them at charlie
what the fuck is wrong with me
i try hard and i get shit on
fucked up family fired from my job this marriage
nothings wrong with me
whats wrong with you
kate you need to what
what do i need
i cant drink because im crazy or something and i cant stay sober because of you
youre blaming other people for your problems
kate picks the tequila bottle back up takes a sip then runs at charlie and tackles him to the ground
youre acting like a freak
kate rips charlies shirt and holds the bottle over his head while straddling him as if shes about to hit him with it
whats wrong with you
kate holds the bottle in the air and looks hard at charlie
she begins to weep
i cant be sober and be with you
kate gets a flash of anger again and just as it seems like shes about to hit charlie with the bottle she upturns the bottle and begins to chug the
charlie tries to yank the bottle away but kate holds on tight
with the bottle at kates lips and tequila pouring down her chin the couple wrestles for control of the bottle
kate wears a uniform and carefully works on a cake
on the other side of the kitchen jenny makes appetizers
hows it coming
you tell me
jenny walks over and tries the icing
nods with approval delicious
a middle aged man stands at a podium in front of a medium sized group of people about twenty five or so including kate jenny and mr
davies and says at this meeting we give cakes to celebrate sober birthdays
we have one birthday tonight for kate for one year
beat jenny and dave are giving her the cake
kate hugs everyone then blows out one candle on a cake before standing at the podium
hey im kate alcoholic
ive heard that your best day drinking is worse than your worst day sober
that is so not true
i had amazing times drinking dancing and laughing
feeling like the most adorable charming girl in the world
and i was adorable
beat id piss my pants but i was still cute
people in the crowd laugh a little bit
when i first tried getting sober i figured that as long as i didnt drink
everything else would just magically work out
but it didnt
beat my marriage fell apart
i got fired from my job
and that shit happened sober
i never read that in any pamphlet
shakes her head that isnt what i signed up for
so i relapsed
another shitty slogan ive heard in the rooms is that when youre sober for a bit and drink again the disease waits for you picks up where it left off
beat im sorry you guys but i hate those slogans
they all sound like bumper stickers
but i have to admit
for me that last one is pretty damn true
beat when i drink
i become another person
and that person is a pretty big asshole
well unless you want to give me drugs or buy me drinks then that person is awesome
people knowingly laugh
i wasnt happy being the good time girl though
and honestly i wasnt very good at it
beat my life is really different than it was a year ago
i live alone
im bored a lot more
i have a job that pays a lot less
beat im thankful for the program for my friends in here who took the time to help me and give a shit about me
kate glances at jenny and mr
there are people that used to be a part of my life that i miss a lot but
long beat im really grateful for this boring new life of mine
kate smiles and steps down from the podium as people clap
charlie owen and a woman millie stand at the bar drinking beer and whiskey shots
owen speaks but millie seems way more into charlie
i was in north carolina for a while durham playing minor league ball
i had some real heat
thats when i met crash here
gestures to charlie hed been sent down to single a to teach me how to carry myself as a pro ball player
we got involved with the same woman an older chick but crash won her in the end
beat hes really taught me some
important life lessons
thats a pretty crazy way to meet
you guys are sorta like that movie
whats it called
plays dumb i dont know
to charlie do you know what movie she means
charlie whos pretty hammered shakes his head
what is it
charlie and owen feign ignorance
itll come to me
to charlie flirty so
what do you do now crash
i write about music
owen gestures to a waitress to bring three more shots
i do freelance for a lot of magazines
but print really is dead
so now most of my stuff winds up on websites
which is depressing
cause you cant hold it you can just look at it
charlie seems lost in drunken thought
long awkward silence
millie puts her hand on charlies arm
you were talking about writing for websites and you kinda trailed off honey
trying to save the situation so crash why dont you tell this nice lady about the days you were up in the show and what the crowds were like and
it was crazy
charlie drifts off for a moment
to millie im sorry im sure youre a great lady
you have lovely hands and hair but
charlie begins to walk away wobbly on his feet
im gonna go to the
im just gonna go
charlie stumbles off
as charlie leaves you want a ride
charlie exits the bar
to owen um
is he cool to drive
yeah hell be fine on his bicycle
he rides a bicycle
oh yeah smiles as a teenager he was a bike racing champion growing up in bloomington indiana
he and his friends were called the cutters and they beat a bunch of rich college kids in this big race
it was great
beat back then i was a kickboxing instructor
charlie rides his bicycle down the street
swerving all over the place hes obviously drunk
red and blue lights flash behind him
charlie turns to see a police officer
charlie leaves kate a voicemail message
into phone seems sort of nervous so i got into a little trouble drunk in public
on a bicycle
beat um i was thinking
maybe i need to go to one of those meetings
id like to go with you though
if thats cool
beat let me know if we could discuss it sometime okay
maybe you could come over to our um my house
charlie hangs up the phone
to himself let me know if we could discuss it sometime
shakes his head such an idiot
kate and charlie stand by kates car which is parked in front by the street
shes just arrived
miss our house
hesitant miss me
long beat ive been sober for a year
kate reaches into her purse and takes out her one year chip showing it to charlie
they gave you that
a couple of days ago
i mean it
beat tuesday is the night i got pulled over
laughs parallel lives huh
kate rolls her eyes
so you dating anyone
taken aback charlie
charlie seems relieved
owen keeps trying to get me to be his wing man and its ridiculous and these girls in bars are so lame and i just keep thinking how i wish
i was meeting you in a bar for the first time and i didnt come with any baggage and i could buy you a drink and flirt with you all night and ask for your number
beat wanna go out sometime
i dont think its a good idea
i fucked up didnt i
kate looks down doesnt speak
yeah i did
i know i did
i had a beautiful woman who used to love me and now when i see her she doesnt even want to look me in the eyes
charlie please dont do this
i miss you
i miss the way you taste and smell and
i miss things about you that used to drive me nuts
i miss you liking shitty s music and fake punk rock from the s
i dont like shitty s music
beat i like good s music
and all i want to do is touch you one more time to just remember to make sure it was real
kate looks charlie in the eyes and gives him a slight smile
changing course or
maybe im a just a delusional fucking idiot
kate and charlie walk in it looks sort of the same but a number of items are missing and its messier
in general the room looks more dude
you look really thin
when did you last eat
i dunno like
im not sure
seems slightly concerned that he cant remember i think um
should we order something
sure yeah or i could make a bacon and egg sandwich
i dont know
i havent really been doing the meat thing
it starts with alcohol
beat have you given up fun too
kate looks at charlie hes half smiling not sure if she finds him funny
off kate sorry
kate cracks a smile
bacon and egg sandwiches
but im gonna make them
charlie raises his eyebrows
kates at the stove cooking bacon and eggs
charlie goes to the fridge and gets a bottle of beer
kate glances at him
charlie puts the beer back in the fridge
i dont care if you drink a beer
thinks about it no
kate stands by the stove and watches as charlie who sits at the kitchen table wolfs down the bacon and egg sandwich
kate seems pleased that charlie enjoys it so much
kate and charlie play croquet
they look a little tired like theyve been playing a while
kate seems to be much better than charlie
have you been playing a lot
i havent played in over a year
then howre you beating me
i dont know
they keep playing
i havent met anyone even vaguely interesting since we separated
stick to the game okay
ive been masturbating like crazy
charlie i miss you
you couldve been killed
riding your bike drunk
but i wasnt
but is that really the point
what are trying to say
beat i worry about you
laughs yeah i can understand that
i used to worry about you
but now i know youre okay
beat that makes me happy
i mean it fucking sucks that youre better off without me but im glad youre doing well
no reply from kate
would you move back in if i came to meetings
you should go for yourself not to make me happy
but would you
im not moving back in
that wasnt the response charlie wanted to hear
listen i should go
its gonna get dark soon
we can always turn the lights on
i dont know
so would you at least
let me take you out on a date
kate says nothing
kate shakes her head
charlie seems hurt but still determined
new direction last question can we just
play one more game
kate doesnt answer
you keep kicking my ass
youve gotta give me a chance to redeem myself
kate thinks about it for a long beat and doesnt say yes
but she also doesnt say no
theres a look of hope in charlies eyes
