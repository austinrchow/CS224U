art imitates life imitates art imitates life written by zack ordynans abrupt close up on max a plain wall behind him
he is normal looking not too nebbish punkish bookish or stylish
he is a high strung guy enjoying a rare moment of un self consciousness
theres an old joke
it comes from the iliad but i think it was popularized by oscar wilde
it goes like this a bears taking a shit like out in the woods one day
and he sees this rabbit also taking a shit
the rabbit wait i mean the bear hes shitting up a storm cuz hes been eating mexican
the wipings taking forever and his shit keeps sticking to his fur
wait what happens next
oh right he asks the rabbit if he ever has trouble wiping
the rabbit says no shit just slides right off him
so the bear picks the rabbit up and wipes his ass with him
pause as if for applause well i never said it was a good joke
and see that makes it perfect because its pretty much the story of my life
we can now see that hes perched on a stool wearing a rem t shirt and old jeans
he gesticulates vaguely as he talks
growing up my parents were huge woody allen fans
personally i hate him
same thing with the beatles such a part of my background that i must have been about by the time i realized how useless it was to rebel by ignoring
the beatles or any other cultural artifact of their generation
even if i did spend my childhood hearing my father go on and on about how like nirvana would never mean anything because theyre not the beatles blah blah
i dont know this is all starting to sound a little bit too angsty you know and thats about the last thing im going for here
shit i really got off track there didnt i
as max shakes his head a hanging radio mike comes into view
it has the call letters of a college radio station on it
high on the wall behind him a glowing on air light is revealed
the perspective is skewed the studio appears cavernous and completely barren
young max about five sits on the floor and watches bananas with his father a large relaxed man with a mustache who reclines in a tacky s chair and smokes
anyway like the beatles thing and this is the point of that whole long winded example i was force fed woody allen from a young age
i remember watching bananas when i was about five
of course i hated it
young max is laughing hysterically at the screen
max stands to the side watching his younger self and his father
the radio mike hangs in front of him
this is my old house
we lived here in a dull suburb of new york until i was ten when we moved to a different house in a different dull suburb of new york
on tv a woman is bit in the breast by a snake and is chased by a group of soldiers
daddy why are they running after her
someday youll understand
pay attention youll learn something
young max turns back to the screen wide eyed
in pajamas adolescent max watches a newer tv in an identical family room
this time annie hall is playing
this wasnt the first time i saw annie hall but it was the first time i actually appreciated it
i was flipping channels on a saturday afternoon and there it was and i was stunned to find i loved it more stunned to find that my parents may have
had a point all along
contd although they were definitely wrong about bananas
close on adolescent max totally engrossed in the film
adolescent max walks alone to class
other students rush by in groups
he looks a little lost
oh god high school
i hated this place
i was a junior when i gave up trying to fit in
fortunately being a social outcast is a lot easier when your school is filled with idiots
a pair of goth posers pass
max keeps his distance
from the other direction a foot tall girl makes eyes at max
he walks into a water fountain drops his books
adolescent max gets hit in the face with a volleyball
everyone laughs at him including the coach
max stands to the side and winces
there was something in annie hall i identified with
maybe it was the style of humor or the defeatist attitude i dont know
all i know is i kept going back
different people are inspired by different things and my source of inspiration became a year old movie about a failed relationship
the volleyball rolls over and he picks it up
from behind max we see the station as it really is small dark cramped and totally filled with crap
max wears headphones sits before a large console and audio gear
he now holds a volleyball
so after high school i ended up here
there was never really any choice not going to college was not an option
of course i brought annie with me
good thing too
watching it quickly became about the only thing i could count on to go right
max is with five friends in the double and they all have lingering style baggage from high school eg
it was freshmen year when we started watching annie hall as a tradition
jeez this must have been the very first time
whats amy doing here
im pretty sure amy wasnt here
amy is attractive bookish and sitting on maxs bed
charles a skinny guy in a large chair tries to get her attention by wiggling his eyebrows seductively
max puts the tape in the vcr hits rewind and moves to sit on his bed
he pauses when he sees how close hell come to amy
finally he climbs over her and awkwardly sits at the far end
amy watches rolls her eyes and looks at beth who shakes her head sadly
beth is pretty in an earthy way spunky and sad at the same time
she looks sympathetically at max who is trying not to act nervous and failing
the couple is sam whos short and charismatic with a cool slightly punkish personal style and jen same height cute and serious conservative dress
they lie on the floor together
thats sam and jen
sam was the alpha male of our group which tends to consist mostly of zeta males
he had been going out with jen a couple weeks and we were all waiting to see if she would change him
sam slides a pillow under her
are you comfortable honey
im fine sam
i was worried about you
sure you dont want me to move over
oh no no jen if youre happy im happy
max and charles exchange a look there they go again
max makes a show of putting a pillow under a large darth vader doll
beth laughs amy is amused
sam looks back and is embarrassed
jen rolls her eyes and gives sam a look
are we gonna watch this movie or what
annie halls credits roll
sam snaps on the lights
wow what a good movie
oh that was so sad
relationships dont have to be like that
i can see why you like this so much
it reminded me of you
uh thanks i guess
does that mean you liked it
max and amy stand and face each other as the lights fade to black around everyone else
i didnt say i liked it i said it reminded me of you
it reminded me of what i didnt like about you the cynicism the neurotic insecurity and oh yeah when you started calling me every day
all the reasons we were never more than friends
well at least youre being honest
of course im being honest
this is a fantasy extrapolated from a flashback
how could i lie to you
im the only person i know who gets insulted in his own fantasies
charles walks by amy takes his arm and they disappear into the surrounding darkness which dissolves to and again max is alone
anyway amy set the tone for the rest of college
the movie is annie hall
the theater is emptying
suddenly erica bursts through the crowd
erica is mad
max follows behind her placating
max freezes in place
the entire crowd of students turns to look at him
he manages a weak smile and turns back to erica but shes gone out the doors into the night
max turns back to the crowd and shrugs but the crowd turns away
max suddenly sees someone beth looking at him
he blushes self conscious and hurries away
and even when it went right it didnt
max and stacy stumble in inebriated laughing
and then i then i after i called the pizza place i called an ambulance and timed them
the pizza of course
the paramedics took minutes to arrive
i cant believe you
did you get in trouble
the station manager said i couldnt go on the air ever again
so whatd you do
i gave him the pizza
they collapse on the bed laughing
stacy rolls over and kisses max on the lips
his eyes go wide and he frantically crawls backwards
dont you like me
it would never work
how would you know
i have a sixth sense
you see dead people
i see dead relationships
stacy sits up frustrated the mood ruined
that was all true but there was something else though
i mean there i was drunk in a girls bedroom and the only thought running through my mind was
max speaks to someone o
what about beth
max is talking to beth
its a beautiful spring day
i mean i know were just friends but you really mean a lot to me and weve been spending a lot of time together lately and maybe
i guess what im saying is maybe we could try going out on a date or something
i mean it wouldnt have to be uh
we wouldnt have to
id love to
hows tomorrow night
um yeah it would have to be after or maybe
yeah tomorrow uh tomorrow nights fine
i know the perfect thing
she splits leaving max befuddled at his change of fortune
max and beth are walking through the night in overcoats
not until sam and jen
a perfect record
i dont get what the fuss is
i knew you and that chris guy wouldnt last a week as soon as i saw you together
but you can tell with everybody
i dont know if thats sad or incredible
or incredibly sad
im amazed im the only one who can tell
take any couple
if its not incompatible lifestyles its conflicting priorities
if its not that its usually clashing levels of self esteem
its always something
living with you would be a nightmare
id be afraid to bring any boyfriends home
oh uh sorry
well just because i see it doesnt mean i talk about it
i dont say a word to my suitemates
you guys never talk about anything important anyway
oh come on we have philosophical discussions all the time
like whether voltron could kill the transformers
to name one hot button issue yes
you want us to talk about girls
sam is nearly married to jen charles doesnt want his relationships to last tommys girlfriends are located in online chatrooms across the country and scott well
for such close friends it just seems weird thats all
i must admit im a lot closer to you than any of them
they are at the library
what are doing here
max and beth remove their coats revealing formal wear
other students give them looks
an older female librarian approaches
ah you must have the reservation for booth seven
yes thats us
right this way then
youd be surprised how many of you lovebirds we get in here
she winks and leads them to the elevator
beth smiles shyly and looks at max but he is merely embarrassed
her smile fades
max and beth are watching the opening credits of annie hall on a tiny tv in a cubicle
they are surrounded by other students in cubicles
isnt this great
well this isnt exactly what i had in mind
what do you mean
for starters i have a serious problem with spending any time in the library when i dont have to
im here once or twice a year as it is
holds up headphones whats the point of seeing this together if were wearing headphones
why not be with a life sized cardboard cut out
that way you can be with someone famous even a dead person
wouldnt you rather be with elvis
cant you just enjoy the moment
im sorry im sorry
im a little nervous
its like our first date and everything
max and beth leave the library
their dispositions have switched max is perky while beth is subdued
i cant believe how many great lines there are
even the little throwaways like when she parks and hes like thats okay we can walk to the curb from here
i loved it im serious
im so glad we did this
yeah me too
but man relationships are a lot of work arent they
uh sure sometimes
beth stops him and they sit on a bench
the night is cold
they sit close and lean in speaking in hushed tones
if im going to jump into anything with you max i need some sign that youre serious about it
you want me to get a tattoo or something
look youve gotta admit youre the most pessimistic person in the world
obviously youve never met my mother
can you be serious for a second
i guess you really havent met my mother
beth isnt laughing
look max this isnt going to work
wait a second
no more jokes
tell me how you feel
why are you doing this
since when have you gotten serious about relationships
your last boyfriend dumped you after four days
beth sits up pulls her jacket closed
well that was intimate
no wait im sorry im sorry hold on
max i dont think this is such a good idea
i mean it would be really foolish to jeopardize our friendship
no it wouldnt
we shouldnt have rushed into this
im sure you know it wouldnt have worked out
i dont know that
please tell me we havent hurt our friendship
you dont even know how much you mean to me
im starting to get the idea
hes dazed slightly ill
beth touches his arm gently and walks away
max turns to us
a radio mike swings into view
things werent the same after
we quickly became the kind of friends who say hi on the paths but dont stop walking
then she moved across campus and changed majors and basically except for the random phone call i havent seen her in ages
pull back to reveal max speaking in the empty station suddenly gets intense
all these dates had one thing in common
and it took charles of all people to point it out to me
its late january and the campus is showing signs of a temperamental winter
this morning we were skipping class
max and charles walk across the quad towards us
at first they are only specks in the distance
max youre insane
its ridiculous that even at a liberal school like this i have to put up with anti semitism
so you got a c minus
dont you think youre getting carried away
he couldnt just fail me think about it
the paper was about my grandparents experience in the holocaust
your paranoia has always been out of control but this is absurd
you dont understand youre not jewish
neither are you
but the professor probably thinks i am
and wasnt that the paper that you handed in two weeks late
you know what else
i think he might be german
will you stop it
we can now see that charles has a fedora cocked back on his head and is wearing incongruous vegas clothes
they walk past and into the university center
its a low traffic time of day
so what do you want to do tonight
im not sure
it is the beginning of the semester its time for our annie hall night
have you ever noticed that the more annie hall you watch the less successful you are romantically
i think wed do much better if we watched say oceans
what are you talking about
if youre sick of annie hall thats one thing but dont blame our sad little lives on it
charles picks out breath mints
no im telling you i was thinking about this over break
ever since we started watching it what has your love life been like
every semester we watch this movie and then spend the semester alone
last semester you hooked up with like a dozen women
you know actresses dont count
im looking for a meaningful sophisticated relationship
like frank and ava
no more shallow dames for this cat
where did you get this grudge against my favorite film
im just kidding around max
well watch it tomorrow
tonight theres a party
and anyway your theory fails to account for our collective dorkiness and bad haircuts
plus look at sam
sam hasnt seen annie hall since freshman year and hes in his third year with jen
so look at what not watching can do to you
why are you still on this
i said i was kidding
what a nightmare
i dunno why i cant stop thinking about these things
i guess ive been a little restless lately since getting back from winter break
everythings been kind of weird lately
he grabs a cd from a rack
hope you enjoyed this weeks reggae revelry hour
this is max filling in for rasta ronnie taking you out with a little bad religion
he puts in the cd hits shuffle repeat and leaves
the caller request lines blink furiously
title card white on black sunday maxs dormitory suite four bedrooms off a common room which has three battered couches a coffee table and in a corner several small fridges
and two televisions in a pile
christmas lights are still up
a neon guinness sign dwarfs it all
max and charles are here standing while sam and jen sit on one couch and scott and amanda sit on the other
charles puts on his gloves and coat
max youre coming and thats the end of it
whens the last time you went to a party
if i went into a strangers house and ate their food under any other circumstance id be arrested
im not taking no
with sam on board its gonna be like old times
he gestures at sam who stands
unlike the hipster from freshman year sam now resembles a middle aged accountant
there are bags under his eyes and square clothes on his back
yeah i havent been out with you guys in ages
jen looks up from her magazine with disapproval
youre going out
aw honey just for a little while
you know i have to work until midnight
its not my fault the supervisor wont let me out of it
he teeters between his friends and his girlfriend
his girlfriend wins
he sits back down trying to hide his disappointment
she has a point guys
i should catch up on my chemistry reading anyway
the guys roll their eyes let down but unsurprised
across the room are scott perpetually poker faced and reserved and amanda understated with the subdued manner of a long suffering wallflower
she sits off to the side sneaking looks at scott
hes watching a golf related infomercial
how come youre not going out with charles and max
graphic design work
i have work too but its okay i got a lot done today
what do you have to do
graphic design work
hes preppier than anyone else conservative clothes capped off by a goofy smile and thick glasses
whats up all
tommy at last
save me from this lounge lizard
yeah what are you doing tonight
fortunately the semesters just begun so before the work piles up i can party
thats why the beginning of the semester rules
great so come party with me
i cant i have physics work
he disappears into his room
charles takes maxs hat from a hook jams it on his head and shoves him towards the door
a typically lame college party still early in the night
the furniture is student budget modern type
a jazz record plays quietly while pretentiously dressed party goers sip wine and eat cheese and crackers
max and charles survey the room drinks in hand
cheers to a new semester full of potential that will surely go to waste
this is it im telling you
this is the semester i pass all my classes and meet the dame of my dreams
good luck and may she have a sister
more importantly may she grant us our occasional freedom
ah forget about sam
i dont like it any more than you
hes become a total non entity
freshman year we were like frank and deano
now its like frank and freakin peter lawford
hey he was one of my best friends
now we share a room and hes like a stranger
hottie at oclock
keep an eye on her for me so it doesnt look like im interested
yeah right then if you fail to sodomize her youll blame me
me or annie hall
look all i said was it would explain our lives
the problem is every crazy theory explains something
i took a class last semester with a professor who claimed that the planet is being destroyed by white male meat eating capitalists
everybody knows that
but she had a theory that explained how apparently racism sexism socialism environmentalism and vegetarianism are all inherently linked
i brought a big mac to the first class and i thought i was going to be the victim of a vegan socialist uprising
sam walks in and makes a beeline for the guys
i made it
i cant believe it
wow the laws of nature have stopped working
maybe i should try to meet some chicks after all
howd you get away
i told her i was going to the lab
she doesnt mind if im working while she is
hows the party
who are they trying to be with this wine and cheese
what kind of party doesnt even have beer
i can get into this
its better than those frat parties
check out the fox in the beret
man its so good to be out
between jen homework and labs i hardly have time for anything
you could always change your major
youd have a lot more free time
i feel the same way about science that i do about jen
its a lot of work but its worth it
i have doubts about both actually
but still what could be dumber than changing your major for a girl
changing your girl for a major
would you do it
it wouldnt be an issue
of course not when has studying ever interfered with whats important like video hockey or your radio show that nobody listens to
i meant id have to have a girl first
and lay off the radio show
theres a reason i took the am slot
and every time i see you doing homework youre taking a break
youre the best ive ever seen when it comes to procrastinating
i should be procrastination is one of my favorite hobbies
isnt it funny that my two favorite hobbies rhyme
charles expression turns sour as he looks across the room
oh shit saras here
sara good looking and excitable arrives with a theatrical flourish
her age and manner indicate among other things that she is a freshman
hey guys whats going on
we were just talking about the mediocre resonations of sub hybrid fields
i cant believe you think theyre mediocre
those guys rock
doesnt get it doesnt care oh
well i just wanted to stop by and say hey to my favorite guys
how was everyones break
she is clearly talking to charles who is scanning the room over her shoulder
it could have been better but it could have been worse
for me thats good
mine was great
i partied with my best friend melanie who i havent seen in ages
arent these parties just the best
so much better than the theater group parties
i dunno its a bunch of year olds who want the year olds to know how mature they are
hey charles you going to the fraternity party after this
you gonna be back at your suite then
maybe ill stop by
uh yeah we should be back in uh many many hours
okay then ill catch up with you guys later
she tugs on charless shirt
i missed you
shit i was hoping to avoid her for at least a few more days
what do you have against her
she seems nice
first she makes my skin crawl
second if word gets out itll ruin my reputation in the freshman dorms
sam looks to max for the real story
never hook up with people in your cast
i am a world class knucklehead
a pretty girl approaches
im sorry to interrupt i thought i heard one of you say max
one of us is max
oh great just as i hoped
i just wanted to say i heard your radio show last week and i thought it was great
thoughtful and poignant and funny too
you know you look just like i imagined too
oh my god you heard my show
then who are you
im an actor
you look like youre in pain
you dont get it i cant do my show if i even suspect someone is listening
now i have to change time slots
im sorry i didnt realize i wasnt supposed to listen
no its no good the whole episode is ruined
this is a disaster
i work in theater a lot
i was kidding
your show actually kind of sucked
it was awesome
i also direct
uh when did you tune in
i need to know which episode you ruined
at one point you dialed a phone sex line
it was hilarious
its not every day someone calls rimjobs to discuss politics
sam quickly pulls charles away as he starts to comment
and she hung up
this isnt the place for that kind of talk
yeah its like for four dollars a minute you should talk about whatever you want
you know the countrys in trouble when a phone sex operator thinks talking politics is beneath her
perhaps shed been screwed by politicians
phone sex is just pretend but politics
i know my ass is still sore
he catches himself and falters
julie notices something
listen im being flagged down by my over protective friends
it was nice meeting you though
how did you know about my show
someone mentioned you
anybody i know
oh duh i guess it would have to be someone i know
it was from a good source
i was told id like you but to really know you i should hear your show
she appraises him for a beat
it was beth
and with that she leaves
max watches her loses her in the crowd
something catches his eye across the room
maxs pov sam is in a corner trapped by an upset jen
from his gestures he is on the defensive
charles moseys over
jen traded shifts and got out of work so she went to the lab to surprise sam
he wasnt there and then tommy gave away that he was here
lets bail before the beheadings begin
plus the rat packs on hbo later
they put on their coats
how can you stand that show
i told you its research
its why i got three phone numbers max while you were talking to that cutie
you get her name
we just met
i was working up to it
man youre worse at picking up chicks than me
we are one sad couple of bozos
max looks at him like hes insane
alone he kicks snow off his boots as he sheds his winter layers
he taps the answering machine
uh hi max
been a while huh
since that lunch last august that somehow never happened
anyway uh just checking in i guess
hope your break was okay
the machine cuts her off
max sighs picks up the phone dials
hey hows it going
yeah in person
so anyway i just wanted to say hi and also stop telling people to listen to my show
of course im serious
of course i havent changed
title card white on black monday sara sleeps on a couch
charles wearing only boxers hung over and mostly asleep passes through the living room
he stubs his toe and crashes into the wall
he continues into the bathroom
sara wakes up and looks around groggily
charles walks out of the bathroom and blinks at sara with surprise
shit sorry you um
its all right this isnt the first time this has happened
at least this time im not the naked one
its just that i mean im just surprised to see you here
hmm yeah i must have shown up after you came back or something
i was planning to go home but i guess i fell asleep
she waits for something from charles
he doesnt respond
she reluctantly gets to her feet
anyway i uh ive got a bunch of stuff to do
ill see you later
as she leaves max comes in still in last nights clothes
you all right
shes around all the time
i chose to live with my hombres not her
shes got to realize that were not right for each other and get on with her life
no i mean i thought i heard you fall or something
i just stubbed my toe
bad way to start the day
the toes the least of it
this is funny in a way
yesterday you were complaining about not having any girls
now youre complaining because you have one
its a shame
and i was attracted to her once too
want me to tell you
i think ive heard enough from the nostradamus of failed relationships to last a lifetime
speaking of failed relationships i was thinking about your annie hall theory
specifically i was thinking that youre insane
i said i was joking so why do you keep bringing it up
its like you insulted my religion
like hey cardinal i think jesus might be why youre not getting laid
your attitudes too dour
youve gotta be more fun
its not my fault annie halls honest about the futility of romance
youre just a wuss
the very thought of not seeing that movie scares you
youre like a junkie you need movie methadone
like from now on you can only see manhattan
forget it i hate manhattan
you think addicts like methadone
my uncle harry didnt seem to mind
so what are we doing for lunch
you mean breakfast
actually im supposed to eat with beth
he doesnt look excited at the prospect but charles does
she hasnt been around in ages
say hi for me
max walks with beth down the city street
she carries an umbrella and scans the skies
wasnt it supposed to rain
max its been ten minutes and were still discussing the weather
think of all the people whove died in hurricanes
i bet they think its a worthy issue
i just feel like there are other things we could be talking about
youre the one person i could rely on to say something original
so what classes are you taking
this was a mistake wasnt it
they stop in front of frannies a small greasy spoon
look lets just call it a day
i was excited to hear from you but i cant take you like this
a couple exit the guy holds the door for them
suddenly from inside max
come sit with us
no im sorry
dont worry about it
to be honest its nice being with someone besides my suitemates for a change
they look in and see
charles scott amanda sam and jen seated around a huge table
they are waving them in
beth enters max reluctantly follows
oh my god beth
its great to see you
its been so long
everyone scoots over to make room
max is still stunned but has no choice
how did we ever fall out of touch
we shouldnt let that happen again
i even miss this place
i live on the wrong side of campus now
you guys still come here
its so dark and the menu is tiny
it never changes thats why
what are you gonna get
maybe an omelet
do you have to get eggs
so dont get the eggs
its just that its the smell
its the smell that bothers me
are you serious
how can you be allergic to the smell of my eggs
dont worry about it jen
hes just incredibly picky about food
even other peoples
look if youre going to have eggs let me at least switch seats with sam so ill be farther away from it
max whats up with you today
join a support group
if it really bothers you why dont you and beth switch
this would put beth next to charles
she looks at him and he smiles
unable to help herself she smiles back
what about people at other tables
should we ask the management to stop serving egg products to people upwind of you
why cant you just get along with everyone for once
alright alright you win well switch
come on beth get up
what makes you so sure im gonna switch
i dont think im gonna move
dont give in beth
ive got your back
you owe me
remember when you threw that egg at me in the dining hall
okay ill get up
but im ordering an omelet
she sits down next to charles and they smile at each other
max walks down the street toward an atm where a long line of college students has formed
next to the atm is an arthouse theater
the marquee reads thru valentines day annie hall and casablanca
he joins the atm line
a moment later julie walks by
she notices him and stops
look at this line
yeah i hate coming here this time of day but i need money
you know gambling debts and all
arent atms great
they save so much time
think about what life must have been like before them
i cant support an acronym without knowing what it stands for
i once joined nambla because i thought it was an animal rights group
so are you a junior too
im listed as a sophomore but ive taken some time off
whatre you majoring in
why is that always the first question
it was my second question
and how would you answer it
id be honest
this week im majoring in media studies
i used to be a double major renaissance footwear and neurosurgery but ya know it was just too hard to get course credit for watching movies
me im in soc
but im leaning toward business or psych
or art history
why dont you just be undeclared
not my style
maxs turn but he spots annie hall on the marquee
impulsively he turns julie to face him so that her back is to it
in doing so he steps away from the atm
are you okay
i thought you needed money
uh i forgot my bookie takes checks now
seriously is everything okay
but i need something from you
its julie no nickname
dont even think of calling me jewel
okay julie with no nickname i um ill see you around
max goes back to the end of the line
lounging are max and charles sam and tommy and scott and amanda
charles pulls a bottle of vodka from a newsbox
come on which of you cats is in
its only monday
shit its only monday
now i really need a drink
charles takes two mugs off the floor throws their contents into a plant and pours
tommy is on one end of a couch sneaking looks at amanda in the middle who is sneaking looks at scott on the other end
how was your day
my day sucked
i spent six hours in the lab and four hours in class
and tonight i have to study for two tests
it better be worth it when i get into grad school
scott hows the design project coming
there are a couple problems
scott gets up and leaves the room
listen i have an extra ticket to this concert tomorrow night
charles sam and max look on with alarm is he really going through with this here now
amanda takes the bait
the ani difranco show
thats been sold out for weeks
its not ani difranco its better two front row seats at the campus choir charity show
so do ya wanna go
why dont you call me tomorrow during the day
its getting late
see you guys later
see you tomorrow
wow that went pretty good
using ani difranco to get laid
ive gotta try that
shell never give up on scott
its not like i expect anything i just like to spend time with her
scott wanders back in with a copy of wired magazine
scott do you mind if i take amanda to a concert tomorrow night
why would i
i didnt think so but not asking would be wrong
no it wouldnt
its not even a date
its nothing serious but it is a date
but theyre going as friends
they are friends
she probably wont even go
scott sits and reads his magazine
tommy drops heavily into a chair
whenever youre done someone please give me an update on my sex life
how does sex life enter if she might not be going and if she does its just as friends
wait can you be on a date with someone youre not dating
i didnt think it was such a big deal
i just wanted to make sure it didnt bother you
scott looks at him like are you kidding
and goes back to his magazine
tommy looks frustrated
this conversation is starting to bother me
title card white on black tuesday max shakes a tumbler as amanda keeps time
this is ridiculous
what other art form involves industrial toxins and complex chemical reactions
nobody ever got cancer from dancing
youre so paranoid
chemicals make me very nervous
isnt this how the unabomber got started
he continues shaking
max do i bother scott when im around
uh boy this fixer smells delicious
cuz sometimes it seems like i do
i know hes not like interested but then sometimes it seems like he is
i just dont want it to be awkward
please tell me the truth
i uh i mean the truth is its not a topic
it doesnt bother him or us
or i mean he doesnt talk about it
so he never talks about me
yes i mean no not with us anyway
i knew it
all im trying to say is youre not a topic that comes up very often
so with all the time we spend together none of you have any opinion of me
amanda storms out of the room
well thats not
what i meant
amanda returns still upset
to unroll the film
max startled fumbles open the tumbler
scott likes you as much as we all do so it doesnt leave much room for discussion
we mostly only talk about what we hate
its just sometimes i wish
yeah i know
amanda takes the negatives opens the door to a closet hangs them from a clothespin and leaves
max takes his selects a clothespin and knocks several others to the floor
he tries to pick them up and manages to step on them
are you coming
he throws the crumpled negatives in the closet and grabs his bag
at the door he notices one stuck to his shoe
he takes the negative off his shoe almost knocking himself over and hurries out
why does it always take you so long in there
max enters to find sam playing video hockey
hey remember the scene in swingers when they play this
that was awesome
i love movie scenes i can relate to
he sits down next to him
wasnt there also a video hockey scene in mallrats
no youre thinking of chasing amy
which one had all the comic book stuff
they both did
what about the star wars stuff
mallrats clerks and dogma
what about the last one
doesnt count it was just an ad for all his other films
you gotta admit its fucking cheap for a movie to refer to other movies
we do it real life
were doing it right now
what youre saying is if this was a movie it wouldnt be any good
our lives would make an awful movie
but if our lives were a movie youd never be able to say that
youd be giving the critics the perfect quote to pan it with
so fucking what
its a shitty movie
sam drops his controller and gets up
are you okay
how come you only play this one video game
video hockey is my game
like a swan i mate for life
more like the loon
max looks him over
holy shit you and jen broke up
your prediction finally came true
come on lets hit the bar
i need a drink
a crummy collegiate dive
sam and max drink coffees
okay so what happened
we were just hanging out and she told me she loves me
completely out of the blue
she says things like that sometimes things like i love that youre my boyfriend ya know
but usually when were in bed or something
but this time it was different all we were doing was watching tv
it was our show the one we like to get romantic to
sam and jen watch the x files
max stands observing
jen cant see him
i was just tired of trying to tell her what she wanted to hear all the time so i tried to be honest
weve been together a long time and i really care about you but i dont know if i love you
this is tough to say but i think something might be missing from our relationship
well not completely
i dont know if i can explain it
there are three things i look for in a girl heart body and mind
and well youve got the body
max is stunned and laughs
jen is stunned too and runs out
you think you know someone pretty well and then they do something like this
when she comes back she slaps me in the face and makes me leave
then she calls crying and asks me to come over
when i go back she kicks me out and says she never wants to see me again
fifty bucks says theres a message on the machine when we get back
max sits and the background dissolves back to
is it really so bad
i couldnt lie to her
dont you know that no matter how often girls tell you they want honesty they never really mean it
look i fucked up alright
i didnt know what to say
its too bad it ended like this
im really sorry
itll be hard to get used to but at least we ended it early
sam throws some money on the table and they get up
hey you know what im in the mood for
jesus that film
have you heard charles theory
come on max i can only deal with one mid life crisis at a time
i cant believe you said that to her
thats so cool
gee at least i can hang out with my friends again
new wave dance party in the pub the small grungy club on campus
a dj plays something obscure from the s
some people dance while the rest including max charles and scott sit at tables by the coffee bar in the back
i was talking to amanda the other day
was that thursday
because there was that half hour when she didnt call or visit
scott why dont you go for her
you seem to get along well
she follows me around now
if we slept together id never get rid of her
look at sam and jen
bad example it could never get that bad
then look at charles and sara
okay ouch for real this time
max looks o
and goes pale
shit shes here
julie walks through the crowd in their direction but stops at another table talking to friends
max exhales slowly
that dame from history class
shes shes just a girl
i shouldnt have mentioned it
but you did mention it
ohhh thats the one from the party
get her name yet
yeah its julie
shes cute and she seems interesting but im sure she has all kinds of horrible flaws i dont know about
this is bad
what do you mean
youre thinking about her
youre already making yourself nervous and you barely know her
you do this every time
i wonder if maybe i should go say hi
see this is what im talking about
if you dont go hit on her i will
do you know the guys shes talking to
the guy in the jacket is annoying
julie sees him
he freezes like a deer in headlights
shit shit shit shes looking this way
what should i
you have no choice
if you back away now shell never get to see the rest of your annoying personality traits
i cant deprive her of that
julie is with andy and mark
andy is your basic hippie resplendent in a ridiculous green shag jacket
mark has a cap and is wearing a j crew long sleeve shirt over a dave matthews band t shirt
whats going on
do you guys know max
this is mark
hey max hows it hanging bud
i uh really like your jacket
is that real carpet
i couldnt believe my luck when i saw it
this shade of shag is like so rare
i was like woah
hey are we gonna burn this or what
hey you guys are like all invited if you can handle some kind bud
maui wowey you know
mark julie and max sit around a wooden table in a small apartments kitchen
andy puts on a cd
hey man you like zappa
dweezil or moon unit
then gets it laughs man that isnt even funny
you should check out apostrophe some time
its an album
i thought he was correcting my grammar
can i get anyone beers
you know it
mark distributes beers to everyone but max
sorry max we dont have enough
uh yeah sure
you want mine
im kinda picky about beer
im more into stuff like guinness bass killians
its a coincidence i swear
julie has trouble opening her beer
mark rushes over with his keychain
i thought guinness was going to be cool but it sucks
made me nauseous
dude puking blows
thats why i smoke weed
you get high right away and no hangover
andy pulls out a baggie of marijuana and rummages through the closet
yeah i dont know
giving me pot is like letting richard simmons smoke crack
im paranoid enough as it is
yeah well some people just cant handle their bud
mark glares disparagingly at him while max pretends to examine the ceiling
julie pulls out cigarettes lights up
andy what are you looking for
andy finds it a gigantic bong made from a vacuum cleaner
he sets it up on the counter
i bet you could use that for yard work
julie you dont smoke either right
i used to but when it became my social life i knew i needed to stop
kind of like why i stopped playing dungeons and dragons
it was uh in sixth grade but it was kind of similar
why dont we go smoke in the living room
oh ampersands crashing on the couch tonight
what kind of name is that esperanto
well his name was mike but he couldnt cope
he thought it was like too square
he wanted a name that would tell people here is a person that only the brave will understand
here is a person living beyond the walls
he must have been listening to apostrophe at the time
or prince cuz like princes name was a squiggly thing
but mike wanted something powerful meaningful and above all something you could type
its already on the keyboard and everything
how much did that cost
because i have a friend who wants to change his name to not bill
is his name bill
no not bill
what about originally
originally he wanted to change it to something else
mark steps forward and pushes up a sleeve
hey julie check out my new tattoo
hes got an anchor on his right biceps
gee mark thats really cool
i know its not what you suggested but i needed something more
max quietly whistles popeye the sailor man
you think youre pretty funny huh
cmon i thought hippies were mellow
you just call me a hippie
sorry popeye i guess i was thrown by the dave matthews merchandise
im in a frat geek
well shouldnt you be back there date raping someone
julie where did you find this creep
max and mark both look to julie she must pick a side
she pulls on her cigarette then turns to mark
mark lay off
go take a hit off the hoover and mellow out
turning to max max im sorry
hey its okay
he takes a beer from the table fumbles and drops it
nah its time
its getting late anyway
she puts out her cigarette and grabs her coat
max and julie approach shelly hall
so you live here huh
does it bother you to be in an all female dorm
no well a little sure
but there are always men around
during fire drills more guys come out than girls
never the same ones either
they come and go
i bet they do
julie catches herself and laughs
max shares a smile with her in the doorway
i had a good time tonight but next time lets have some real fun
oh fine uh next time ill bring jack nicholson and a case of schnapps
good night max
julie enters the dorm
max watches her through the glass
title card white on black wednesday close up of a schedules column heading wednesday
max reads the schedule on the door
his watch says am he finds wednesday am julios death metal jamboree
he peeks behind the door the station is empty
he starts to slip inside when
he whirls closing the door guiltily
beth comes down the hall laden with books
it was great running into your friends but
i feel bad about what i said
do you want to get together later
i dont know im sure i have something to do that ive forgotten
come on its bad enough we fell out of touch but we cant even have lunch
we had breakfast
every time we try to do anything you have an excuse or forget to show up or you cancel
you cancel on me too
things have been a little you know awkward
look the whole thing was my fault
lets drop it okay
beth throws up her hands turns away
okay lunch you win
now youre only going because i gave you a hard time
guilt is a powerful force
just be glad its on our side for once
okay how is the kidney bean at noon
awful just like every other time of day
their food is just birdseed prepared fancy
the fabulous diner then
friday at noon
max finds his old slot on the schedule and crosses it out
then he slips into the station
a shitbox pulls up
sam drives max rides shotgun
scott and amanda are in back
and then i got to thinking you know i really think i like vanilla
sam turns off the car
ill be right back
they get out and go into the store
they enter an aisle and sam grabs various items as he talks
jen called yesterday while we were at the bar
you call her back
i went over there to talk again today
shes taking it hard
were having dinner tonight
dont put me in the middle of this
are you definitely broken up
because it seems a little up in the air
yeah were definitely broken up
i guess sometimes it seems like were sliding back into our old patterns
he takes some vaseline from a shelf
max looks horrified
its not what you think
i need a petroleum jelly for the polymers class im ta ing
suddenly a rack of condoms catches his eye
max sees it too
dont even think of it
what the heck
he takes a box
his arms are totally full now
i need a basket
he dumps his pile of stuff into maxs arms the vaseline and condoms on top and disappears around a corner
max sighs turns around
and bumps into julie
um its for a friend
i would hope so
no seriously i just got a job at a petting zoo
oh of course
and the best part is its work study
i think the psych
hey thats my new major
i got so sick of soc
so uh got any plans tonight
well theres a great local band playing the pub
you should come
might be cool to catch a band before success ruins them
ill see you there
she leaves with a wave
sam turns the other corner
i cant believe what you just did to me
julie was just here
suddenly scott arrives
i need socks
what were you doing sitting in the car then
the car pulls up
ill be right back
amanda and scott are alone in the back
amanda looks tense
scott can i ask you something
its just that sometimes youre really cool and other times you act like im not even here
or like you dont want me around
well i was wondering if
a moment passes
all right look im just going to come right out with it
i think i like you
i think i i really like you
as she opens her mouth scott opens the car door and exits
so where are the socks
an absurd metal band plays on stage
the room is packed and the crowd is mostly one big mosh pit
max wades through the slamdancers freaked
he makes it to the coffee bar
julie soon appears sweaty
shes been here awhile
its good to see you
the surging crowd shoves max into julie
they fall against each other
max is near panic but julies laughing getting off on the energy of the room
the singer smashes the mic against the wall then brandishes the stand menacingly at the crowd who step back in alarm
who are these guys
theyre sludge core
youre all a part of the conspiracy
youre all human
every one of you wore diapers
youre all full of shit
the singer storms off
the band follows
the crowd applauds with some confusion
julie whistles loudly and claps
thats their trademark
they insult the crowd at the end of the set
sometimes he breaks the mike two songs in
we were lucky they played for almost minutes
luck had nothing to do with it
look the mikes not even broken
they were just tired of playing but they wanted to give us something to remember
now thats showmanship
you have to wonder about any band whose highlight is their exit
it worked for the who
im sorry the who
come on is that the kind of a joke a celebrity dj would make
i still cant believe you tuned in
its like an invasion of privacy
youre a riot
lets get out of here
she pulls him away
the lounge is empty
julie sits on a couch
max sits next to her but seems uptight about getting too close
so uh im sorry about that thing with uh chip was it
hes been following me around for years
hes easily threatened
hes lucky i uh almost pulled a jackie chan on his ass but you know my kung fus gotten rusty since i left the hong kong military
dont worry about him he isnt a threat
youre far more interesting
asking me not to worry is like asking a bear to use toilet paper
theres this joke that sums it up for me
julie leans in and looks at him with intensity
youre not fooling me you know
i can see right through this aloof image
its not an insult
i get the sense that theres this whole other side of your personality
i hope hes a better dancer
see this is the side you show playing everything off as a joke whenever things gets serious
but theres more to you
did i ever tell you about the bear and the rabbit in the woods
tell me something about yourself something i never would have guessed
and dont even try to come up with some witty retort
max agape is on the spot helpless
julie grabs her coat
i should get going
a deep breath we barely know each other but youre all i think about
off balance covering i said something i never would have guessed
i bare my soul and now youre the funny one
that wasnt quite what i was looking for
now its your turn right
okay heres one i have a boyfriend
i sure hadnt guessed that
okay well not anymore
eric and i were together in high school but we broke up over break
since high school wow
hes kind of a jerk
it was all a waste of time
sometimes i i i dont know max why dont you have a girlfriend
on the spot uh i have a friend who says its because i watch annie hall too much
that film practically raised me
and it has a very positive message too
i wish more guys were into it
be careful what you wish for
you dont know what im wishing for
max there are a lot of girls that would go for a guy like you
this is one of those moments in a movie when a character has a chance to say something and of course they do and its perfect and it becomes a
julie starts to lean in
suddenly the building manager walks in
hes a dead ringer for woody allen
max starts violently
max is beside himself
julie sees that the moments over and gets up
are you hungry at all
i know this place
their food is bad but they compensate by being overpriced
they walk out
say did that guy look like
yeah i noticed that too
max is relaxed and chatting while julie drives
ive been able to do it since high school
thats a scary gift
i mean even if people are destined to break up the will to stay together is very powerful
thats the real tragedy
look at all the unhappy couples in the world
i dont know if your gift is really that special max
i mean we break up with everyone we ever date
until the one we stay with forever
see how ridiculous dating is
how did you get this attitude if you love annie hall
what do you mean
thats what annies all about
julie looks dubious
max flicks on the radio
college radio for the masses and thats it for me
sound of cds falling whoops
anyway next up is verbal diarrhea with todd duke
why is your radio set to the campus station
actually its stuck on it
its how i first heard your show
i thought beth told you about me
it doesnt matter max
now that ive met you your shows not important
the kind of place thats perfect for parents weekend
at this late hour it is filled with young professionals
theres a dance floor where couples dance to the standards
max and julie are at a table in the corner looking out of place
this is a nice place
interesting mix of people here youve got these men with their suits taking their waitress girlfriends out to impress them into bed because they cant get them any other way
really as if a fast car can ever make up for a small dick
if it did do you think id be here
id be down at the porsche dealer with a ski mask and an uzi
guys always obsessed with dick size
well sure theres that but it would also be nice to have a car with a heater
lets guess which couples are destined to break up
how about them
indicates a couple dancing
no i cant tell just by looking
i need some info
their waitress donna arrives
do you have a boyfriend
max is aghast
donna stares a beat
what do you need to know
uh just a description
describe him for us
its okay im a psyche major
well hes tall
close with his brother
uh what else
believes in god
has a sweet tooth
so can i take your order
were not ready thanks
donna puts her pad away
so what was that all about then
max here thinks youre going to break up with your boyfriend
its all in there
you qualified tall so as not to make him appear too handsome said friendly like a euphemism chose fixes cars instead of the more dignified auto mechanic and finally mentioned
his brother a propos of nothing like youre threatened by him
the waitress looks like shes been slapped
after a pause she turns her back and walks away
dont shoot the messenger
im such an idiot
shes going to shit in our food now
i cant believe you asked her that
hey were all people here right
if you want to talk to someone talk to them
i dont spend my time trying to justify talking to people or whatever
you limit yourself if you do that
if you spend too much time worrying you dont spend enough time living right
what are you a fortune cookie
you have to keep yourself open to possibilities in life
im the first one in my family to go to college
sometimes i cant believe im here at a semi prestigious university getting a halfway decent education this has always been my dream
how did you end up here
i had a coupon
i know what you mean financial aid is a bitch
and the university experience itself is kind of disappointing
all those rich students with no idea how lucky they are
but i dont think about them
i think about me i think about where i want to be someday a world traveler running some huge company or you know doing some fantastically important work
and when the day comes that i can relax im going to charter a boat sail around the world and see the seven wonders
i thought they broke up when stevie left
come on arent you curious about the world
doesnt the sheer scope of life fill you with wonder
wonder horror its such a fine line
but shes smiling at him and he cant help but return it
tommy sleeps while the tv proclaims golf products
max comes in and quietly shuts it off
tommy gurgles and rolls over
swallowed a bug
max goes to his room
sams bed is empty
he shakes his head picks up a key from his desk and leaves
max sits on a stool as in the beginning but this time we are pushing in
sometimes i look around and wonder where the hell my friends came from
tommy and sam are in each others faces yelling
tommy waves a book and sam waves a newspaper
like the other night tommy and sam nearly got into a fistfight over whether the x files is based on a true story
charles makes out with a girl in a stall covered in colored paper
she has a cigarette on a black holding stem which brushes the paper
before that scott covered the entire bathroom in multi colored post it notes which charles somehow set on fire nearly getting us kicked out of housing
max sam scott and tommy are there reading fanclub newsletters x philes font ain of youth men are from mars women from venus
charles walks in arm in arm with a woman who is obviously a professor and escorts her to his room
theyre great friends
i feel safer among them than among my own family
contd they always know what not to say how not to make things uncomfortable
after a beat the group resumes reading like nothing happened
except max who cant believe what he just saw
max in close up
over his shoulder images of beth arguing with him from various moments in their history
even when beth was part of the group she didnt fit in
like she never just lets things be
she always has to know exactly what im thinking
it was sort of cute when we were friends but now its like a proctology exam
hard to imagine a friendship going more wrong
the image of beth stops on a shot of her looking at him with undisguised disappointment
she dissolves into a image of julie beaming
ah but julie
shes smart shes funny isnt constantly hassling me
how she can stay such a dreamer is beyond me
hey i wonder if shes listening now
the thought stops him cold
the image over his shoulder vanishes replaced with a plain cement wall
we zoom out fast
max is back in reality the station crowded and claustrophobic
he tries to regroup
taps the mike hello
clears his throat so uh as i was saying
my friends are weird
i think its time for some music
he grabs for a cd
title card white on black thursday
max and charles stir their coffee
fuckin hate this flavored shit
anyway i cant believe the cat in the shag jacket was andy
i dont want to talk about it
when i knew him as a freshman he was pre law
anyway it sounds like things are going well between you and julie
this is a real change of pace
staying away from annie hall is like some kind of magic trick
i was wondering about that
you seem different lately
you know how when things are going badly there are certain parts i like to watch
like how you spent your whole sophomore year watching that lobster scene on repeat
i realized that i dont know what part to watch when things are going well
you know i actually regret mentioning that theory
in fact sam and i were thinking of watching it tonight
are you on crack
i meet a girl i really like that i may actually have a chance with and you want me to put it all in jeopardy
watching it without you would be weird
that film is you max face it
but its ruining my life
charles drinks his coffee and shakes his head
i have to tell you something
i scored last night
the theory works for you too
max drops his coffee thunderstruck
it wasnt premeditated
how could you sleep with beth
look nobody knows about it
it wont happen again
of course not
that might constitute a relationship
max is at a loss
the cashier looks over suspiciously
im sorry max
i wasnt sure if youd care
i dont care
oh god this is my fault
if only i hadnt called her
what do you want me to say
im sorry man
let me pay for your coffee
youve gotta be kidding
he starts to leave
going back to the suite
i dunno where im going
max distressed passes the campus theater where someone is tacking up a poster for annie hall
max sees it and averts his eyes
he walks past the kidney bean
something catches his eye through the window
he changes direction and enters
max sees beth eating alone at a table reading a tom robbins book
he walks over
beth isnt thrilled to see him
what are you doing here
a sudden craving for bird seed
i figured id had enough actual food this week
well be careful someone in the corner is eating egg salad
max sits down across from her
after an awkward pause are you okay
something about you sounded different
no actually last night on the
oh no hes here
but i just left him in the general store
but she isnt talking about charles shes looking across the room at steve a good looking guy who is talking to a girl
who is he with
he never calls me anymore
i think he might be seeing someone
have you heard anything
i dont even know him
whats so special about this guy anyway
i mean are you and he
well no i guess not
i know somethings going on
im such a fool
why are we always attracted to people that are completely wrong for us
is it because they excite us
i guess so
you know we should try to be more exciting
like the other day i waited until the last minute before returning a video
and next time i swear im not going to rewind
i can be a rebel too
the other day i went to bed without flossing
boy are we pathetic
okay its pathetic but were okay you know
but sometimes i feel like
she puts on her coat and gathers her things on her tray
im glad youre here max
i didnt realize how much i missed you
i feel the same way about the sex pistols
missing them is far cooler than having them around
thats not what i meant max
she heads for the exit
sam looks dubiously at max who waves his arms and shouts
what do you mean you saw julie with someone
so what are you saying
they were having lunch
who was he
what did he look like
youre over reacting
how could she see someone else
youre not even dating
but we might be
i cant handle competition sam im not the competitive type
it was just lunch in the cafeteria
he looked completely normal
i cant compete with that
he fumbles with his coat man its all gone so wrong so fast
he rushes out the door
max knocks on the door to julies suite
he paces frustrated
suddenly judy comes out of a stairwell
can i help you
yeah do you know where julie is
are you max
youre just like she described
hi im judy
im sure she mentions me all the time
oh yeah judy
judy unlocks the door and holds it open
come in come in
make yourself at home
max enters cautiously
the common room couldnt be more different than his own clean and tasteful
judy hangs her coat up
this may be completely inappropriate but can i ask you something
the tattoo did it hurt
i mean not much
why didnt you use your frats logo
well uh the guy said its too hard to draw two grown men kissing
say which one is julies room
on the left
shes got the single
max pushes julies door open with one hand while keeping an eye on the front door
uh do i come here often would you say
the front door opens and julie enters
what are you doing here
judy let me in
judy comes out of her room
you know i think im going to get a tattoo too
judy mark has the tattoo
this is max
yeah isnt he great
glaring at him she goes into her room and closes the door
what a surprise
what brings you here
i was uh in the area and thought id pop in
find out how your day went
it was excellent how was yours
i had lunch with a dear dear friend
anyone i know
shes a foreign exchange student
spends a lot of time modeling
yeah the agencies wont leave her alone
we had uh quite a lunch
lots of shellfish and wine
and uh rhinos horn
well yeah uh shes on the kosher meal plan
look i gotta go
nice seeing you again
he splits leaving julie wondering what that was all about
outside max beats himself in the forehead several times
then a picture of misery he trudges off he walks in on someone doing a show
he leaves dejectedly
he goes back to his suite where sam and jen sit like statues watching the x files
he makes a quick exit
passes by julies dorm again
eventually finds himself approaching the university center
a ska band plays these boots were made for walking before two small lines of skanking rude boys
charles is alone at the bar
max sits down beside him
i just made an ass of myself
oh is it the weekend already
dont worry about it
your troubles dont compare
sara blew up at stacy and nearly destroyed our first rehearsal
yeah youve got real problems
do you have time to talk
uh oh here she comes
can you believe stacy at rehearsal
she jumps on the stool next to him
charles turns to max for help but hes already gone
title card white on black friday max plays video hockey
charles comes in
studying for a test
you shouldnt talk theater major
hey i have a test on lighting next week thatll make your hair go grey
he sprawls on the couch
thanks for bailing on me last night
i had to hear sara gab for an hour
why didnt you just leave
at least you can escape your problems
what do you mean
i just got my textbooks for this term
max holds up a thick book post modern semiology
the entire cover is a still from annie hall
when the gods give you a sign like that theres only one thing to do
he passes a controller to charles and they play
by the way i saw julie last night
was she alone
not if you count this huge purse she had
she was rummaging through it and finally had to dump the thing out
i swear im surprised kennedys brain didnt fall out of that thing
anyway it made me think of annie hall
although julie dresses better
max slowly lowers his controller
what are you saying i like her because shes like annie hall
i didnt say that
oh my god i think youre right
i didnt say that
i dont want to like someone because she reminds me of someone in a movie
now im wondering why i like her
maybe i dont
good lord max
take some harder classes
sam returns sees what they are playing
look at you two
wouldnt something else be fun for a change
how about goldeneye
i dont know how to play it
lucky for you i actually have time to teach you
normally i would be having lunch with jen
oh shit i forgot about lunch
max gets up and runs out
charles and sam exchange a look
man hell do anything to avoid change wont he
beth is alone working on a salad
max runs up and jumps into the booth
not looking up so glad you could make it
hey im here right
thank god for small favors
are you still upset about the thing with steve
yeah a little
this semester isnt shaping up too well
its tough getting back into the groove of things and you know being on campus
well you know
nothing even worth mentioning
but theres something
who is it
do i know her
actually um yeah its julie
why arent you thrilled
well im not sure im that into her
this i gotta hear
she reminds everyone of annie hall
well of course why do you think i sent her to you
god im such an idiot
that film is finding more and more ways to ruin my life
max pounds his head against the table but beth is amused
whatre you talking about
look at my life
look at this thing with julie
jeez shes not like annie when the film starts shes like annie at the end
or maybe the millennium edition
the worst part is maybe i knew this all along
max whats really the problem here
and annie halls not even my type
you have a type
im into bipeds with most of their teeth
no lutherans or fictional characters
who would you rather sleep with julie or annie hall
thats not two choices thats one
okay annie hall or me
max knocks over her soda
this is a serious hypothetical question
well i must admit it would be
beth snorts then laughs
dont feel bad you came in second
ill take what i can get
its only because youd laugh at more of my jokes in bed
it adds a whole other dimension youd be laughing with me in addition to at me
you joke while youre in bed
thats so weird
no its weird because i do the same thing
guys find it annoying
girls think im a loser
and you really like her
its corny but theres something about her that brings me happiness
max you wouldnt know what to do with it if you had it
max frantically cleans up all the pizza boxes wrappers and empties
charles leans on the wall arms crossed
youve gotta be kidding
look either go somewhere else or stay in your room
cant i even meet her
you already did
max stuff the trash with paper squirts lighter fluid all over it and takes annie hall from the shelf
what are you doing
julies coming over to watch a movie
i dont want to take any chances
he carries the tape over the trash but charles snatches it from him
dude sam and i were gonna watch that
annoyed he puts it back on the shelf and goes to his room
the doorbell rings
max smooths his hair one last time
max and julie browse a shelf full of videos
since scott joined a video club weve got a lot of shitty movies youll ever oo heres buffalo thats a need
it is but i saw it a couple of weeks ago
i dont think i can sit through it again
you mentioned something about annie hall the other night
do you have that lying around
isnt that it on the end there
sure it is
um no its just the box
the tape inside is wrestling
no it isnt
um its been recorded over
you dont believe your friends theory right
no of course not
because its insulting
a cop out
i i know its just i watched it last week
how about airplane
oh good idea
but next time annie hall
max puts in airplane
julie and max sit on a couch together
julie and max share a blanket
max turns toward julie just as she turns toward him and their lips end up in the same place
julie pulls back
what are you
why did you back away
why did you
it wasnt me i wouldnt have backed away
ill ill have to remember that later
max turns back to the movie
a beat passes
julie looks at him amused
actually my memorys not what it used to be
if i dont act on this information now
max pulls the blanket up over them
the sound of kissing
no its okay
are you comfortable i mean is this okay
shut up already
suddenly the sound of a lock turning
max and julie quickly get out from under the covers
sam and tommy enter oblivious to the quick recovery of innocence on the couch
you know how important your sense of smell is
what about touch
missing the smell of rotting milk is hardly equal to not being able to enjoy sex
oh hey max
guys um this is julie
julie this is my roommate sam and thats tommy who also lives here
nice to meet you guys but i was just leaving
i have work to do before class tomorrow
but the movie is
do you want me to walk you home
sure all right
boys nice to meet you
max leaves with julie
okay so what about body odor then
max and julie collapse onto the pillows exhausted from sex
her room is extremely disorganized decorated in an idiosyncratic mix of punk rock icons and nature scenery
i wish i had a cigarette
i wish i smoked
its strangely sexy when guys smoke
yeah and its the only thing between me and my dream of becoming steve mcqueen
they lie in each others warmth under the blanket
you and beth are pretty close huh
you call that pillow talk
we used to be
there were times i would have been lost without her
other times it was like the lost leading the lost
she really cares about you
we tried something once but it was a disaster
its great that youre still friends
sometimes im not sure if i have a say in it
on a campus this small its like shes everywhere
sometimes this place annoys me
theres so much bullshit
my semester off was the right idea
what happened to old fashioned hard work
thats what summers are for
the school year is for reckless debauchery
max looks at the clock
jesus i have to get going
ill never get my homework done if i sleep all weekend
ah fuck it who cares
why not just set your tuition on fire
this coming from the girl who thinks college is bullshit
max just lies there comfortably resting with a small smile
so get on up lazy
max sits up and puts one foot on the floor before realizing hell be naked if he stands
he tries to grab his jeans with his toes
julie observes him dryly
how can you be shy after you know
some things arent quite as impressive in the light of day
you have a problem with nudity
of course not
im a big fan of it
max picks up his pants
julie taps him on the shoulder and flicks the sheet up to flash him
he starts and drops them
its too easy
max puts his jeans on shoves his underwear and socks in his pocket
what are you doing tomorrow
a double shift i get out at five
this weeks gonna suck
i have homework that cant be avoided
the worst kind
max is dressed
julie lies in bed thoughtful
nick cave begins to croon into my arms
max leaves the building and stops to look at the winter sunrise
super black on white saturday i dont believe in an interventionist god but i know darling that you do students work in the library as light refracts through icicles in
but if i did i would kneel down and ask him not to intervene when it came to you
a boy and a girl hold hands as they cross an icy street
squirrels play in the light
the sun reflects off the university center windows and back onto the snow
not to touch a hair on your head to leave you as you are but if he felt he had to direct you direct you into my arms
the lights are low
max is at the console staring into space
nick cave is playing softly on the monitors
into my arms
into my arms
the phone rings
max snaps out of his reverie and stares at it in horror
after several rings he answers it
nobody is here right now
please leave a message
split screen between max and julie in bed smoking
nice try max
i thought you had homework and stuff you liar
great song by the way
i told you not to listen
come on youre funny you have good taste in music
hey whered the music go
two students lying in bed together listen to the radio
on the radio i dont know
on the radio i dont get it it stopped when i picked up the phone
max pushes up a slider and hears the following coming out over the monitors im just calling to say that you left your underpants and took mine
max reacts then screeching feedback rips over the airwaves
continue split screen with where julie is frantically pulling the chord out of the back of her radio
max fades the phone out the music up
dont be too proud of your five seconds of fame
more people would hear us if we shouted out the window
my radio days are over im now deaf
didnt i tell you not to listen to my show
you were only playing music
well all these songs are about you
youre a real piece of work you know that max
max enters and takes off his coat
sam sits up annoyed
man im sorry
go back to sleep
whats the point
i have to be up in minutes anyway
not that i could sleep
i didnt sleep either but for some reason im still refreshed
i feel great
sam stares at him
what the fuck is your problem
last night we officially became a couple
we hooked up
that doesnt mean anything
it meant something to me
sam considers him
i dont believe you
just last week you told me the happy should be quarantined
i dont know you anymore
still down about jen huh
we broke up for good last night
he gets out of bed and starts dressing
oh man im sorry
i thought i knew what i was doing
ever since she became my girlfriend ive felt more and more constricted
like i was trapped under the weight of the label
you guys were together a long time
yeah we were
have fun in saturday lab
ah eat shit and die
max is alone playing goldeneye with a dopey smile on his face
charles comes in rolls of blueprints under his arm
whats this goldeneye
charles sits and they play against each other
have you been here all day
yeah this games so much fun
max gotta tell you youre really creeping me out
tommy comes out of his room dressed in a shirt and tie
sam said the same thing
hes still depressed
still cant believe he broke up with jen
i saw her yesterday and she looked sad
i asked her how she was doing and she said fine and asked me why i was asking
a non denial denial
i invented that
shes learned from the best
i saw her too
she didnt seem upset to me
charles kills max with a rocket launcher
i was hanging with sara
that girl pisses me off
shell say the dumbest things like the breeders are better than the beatles
happiness is a warm gun
i wouldnt go that far
shes just a daffy dame thats all
now stacys foxy but shes too serious
what about beth
what about her
sam comes in totally morose
silently he joins them in three player mode then quickly kills himself with a rocket launcher
you just came from jens huh
yeah we just broke up for good
oh man im sorry
was it you or her
it was just time i guess
puts down the joystick i have to go uh mail a letter or something
he puts on his coat and leaves
charles tommy and max exchange looks
max turns off the game
well that took the wind out of my sails
whats up with you
got another date with amanda
it wasnt a date
a no show huh
yeah but its okay
todays her birthday and she invited me out for dinner at a nice restaurant
she invited all of us
well thats cool too
its barely lunch why are you dressed up
i dont want to wait til the last minute to pick out my clothes
are you really wearing that tie
damn i knew this was the wrong one
he runs into his room
charles laughs at him
i dont wanna go to a birthday party
im broke and i wanna hang out with julie
so take her
and pray saras not there
max and julie walk through the snow together toward a parking lot
shes taking deep drags off a cigarette
this has been some crazy week
i still have a six page paper due monday
triple spaced in point type thats only like words
if a pictures worth a thousand words thats like a bad photocopy
dont worry about it i needed a break
good to get out and enjoy the weather
what are you from maine
phew because i dont know if id be able to handle something like that
thats a hard thing to drop on a person
im from northern vermont
not too far from canada
shit im sorry
it sucked but i managed
read a lot
had a few close friends
thats all you need
its quiet up there dull but nice
it sounds it
they get to her car and he surprises her by kissing her
she responds after a hesitation
max sits tensely in the passenger seat
look out for that truck
the trucks about two blocks away
will you relax
i know how to drive
watch the driveway
ive got it under control max
anyway everyones dying to meet you
she drags on her cigarette
this is going to be fun
all my friends meeting my girlfriend
its going to be great
did you just call me your girlfriend
ah well i guess thats alright
she looks at max and smiles
we pan around a long table beth at one end then jen and sam charles looking annoyed and sara tommy at the other end then scott and amanda and two
everyones talking and looking at menus
max and julie enter
max looks around paranoid
he sees donna the waitress glaring at him and hurries after julie who is already at the table introducing herself
beth i cant believe youre graduating so early
ive spent my life learning how to be a student and at the end of the semester it will all be useless
everybody already wants to know what im going to do and i have no idea
i started making up stories to tell people
an aunt asked me if im excited about chicago and i couldnt remember if id said i was moving to the city or going to see the band
something similar once happened to me except i didnt know nashville pussy was a band
tommy laughs and blows tea out his nose
i cant believe im graduating
my whole life ive known what was next
but when i graduate the next step is
something that pays the bills
my grandfather once told me that if you love your job youll never work a day in your life
hes years old addicted to c span and had to be removed from a supermarket recently for shouting about republicans
now i know where you get it from
you should do whatever makes you happy
grad school baby
stay out of the real world as long as possible
sam and jen sit close together and are both subdued
i cant believe im graduating next year
i already have a recurring nightmare about it
you have plenty of time dear
she rubs his arm soothingly
behind her back charles rolls his eyes and sticks his finger down his throat
sara sees it
come on charles show a little dignity
he whirls on her
youve been following me around like a lost dog since break and youre talking about dignity
youre always in my way i cant get away from you
what are you talking about
if theyre making me sick thats my business
leave me alone already
she storms out
the table is aghast
julie averts her eyes politely
beth pokes max urging him to do something
we make you sick
sam say something to him
why should i
weve made him sick for years
how dare you
beth smacks maxs leg do something
he begs off
you think everythings okay if its true but some things are true and not okay
when are you going to realize im a different person and entitled to my opinion
its my goddamn life
jen turns away glaring
max anxiously looks at julie who stares above her menu
please guys its my birthday
were here to celebrate
cant we all just get along
goddamn it scott i am so sick of you making fun of me
you are the meanest person ive ever met and i dont know why anybody even talks to you
you are such an asshole
they lock gazes for a beat
sara comes back in and sits down sullen
there is a long uncomfortable silence
a waiter arrives
are you ready to order
unsure he turns to the next couple
the waiter looks around notices the tension
why dont i come back
i heard you switched majors
yes im psych now
i didnt like soc
im a soc
oh sorry i just meant i needed something more ya know relevant
psych is relevant
well look im only in college for the degree
most of the stuff they teach us is pointless anyway
julie looks at max say something
heheh i bet thats why they call it academic
college is a great opportunity
its about more than getting a job
yeah its about avoiding the real world for as long as possible
i work in theater so this is great training for me
you call theater the real world
now julie is hitting maxs leg help me out here
but max is petrified watching his worst nightmare unfold
some of us work really hard to get through school
look my parents worked their whole lives to give me the opportunity to be here
but the truth is private schools like ours make money by showing students a good time for four years
you think social work is bullshit
thats not what i this bullshit is going to put me in debt for the next forty years
julie punches max in the thigh
he jumps blinks
why dont you just drop out if everythings such bullshit
so whats everybody going to order then
what a bunch of spoiled whiny college brats
nobody has anything more to say
everyone looks away
max is shell shocked
im gonna work for nasa
julies car pulls up
her bumper sticker eat animals dont max opens the door gets halfway out turns back
are you sure
no its okay
i just need a few hours to work
itll be fun just the two of us
julie lights a cigarette off her old one
okay see you later
she peels out
max straightens up
scott comes out of his bedroom
if she stands you up are we still not allowed in here
its my time to watch south park
why would she do that
its already past eleven
theres a knock on the door
max gets the door
scott exits disappointed
julie enters smoking
sorry im late
you wouldnt believe what cross campus traffic was like
thats the worst excuse i ever heard
i mean it
you wanna hit the video store
no youve got something here that ive been looking forward to all week
she grabs annie hall from the shelf
ah shit no
you must face your fears
relax its a very positive film
you just have to know how to look at it
its really refreshingly positive
the closing credits are rolling
max and julie look somewhat disconcerted
boy what an uplifting movie
such a refreshingly positive message
she doesnt respond
you know i think i prefer manhattan
how can you say that
annie hall is so uplifting
its just deeper more sophisticated i guess
listen thanks for dinner and the movie tonight but i should get going
but its still early
julie goes to the door
he tries to kiss her
she pulls back
i dont know if this is a good idea right now
okay how about right
he tries to kiss her again
she ducks it comes back into the room sits down
max stands tense
listen since the other night ive been doing some thinking
theres your mistake
mindless happiness is always better than thoughtful reservation
unless youre talking about nude bungee jumping
i dont think that this is a good time for us to jump or leap or whatever you know together
into a relationship
we just saw a movie about how relationships are worth it no matter what happens
yeah i guess we really did
well youre right max and this relationship was worth it
max covers his face breathes deep
are you okay
will you please calm down
i like you very much but i told you i just got out of a serious relationship and it ended really badly
we saw each other almost every day at the beginning but by the end of the semester i hadnt seen him in a month
he stopped returning my calls and stuff and i mean he basically avoided me then i heard he was seeing one of my friends
but that was him not me
its nobodys fault i know
i mean ive been trying but its hard
relationships are very difficult to maintain
there are so few successful couples
like my parents have been married thirty years but my parents are divorced
okay bad example
but why think ahead
were here now
cant we just enjoy our time together
max i did believe me
what was all this i mean was any of it
i dont know what i was doing
i didnt think about where this might lead until it was too late
but it might lead to
tommy walks in half asleep in his pajamas
he turns on the tv and sits down
max stares at him
tommy suddenly realizes he isnt alone
uh re run
he turns it off and quickly exits
max tries to pull himself together
are you okay
i knew that damn film was cursed
why did i listen to charles instead of annie
its not an anti relationship movie
what are you talking about
its a fucking textbook
youre not listening to me max
just like youre not listening to annie
no matter what you think right now this was worth it
because i got to meet you and got to be close to you
i dont know
the vcr whirs to a stop and annie hall ejects
max stares at it upset and thoughtful
title card white on black sunday
pan left to right across peoples chests an x files shirt a lounge shirt with a wide collar a stephen hawking shirt an ani difranco shirt
pull back to reveal l to r sam charles tommy and amanda sprawled on the couches from maxs pov in the doorway
theyre drinking vodka out of coffee mugs
the tv is on but the sound is off
everyone looks tired and sad
sam thumbs a copy of scientific american
why are humans smarter than chimps if we have of the same genetic material
who says were smarter
look who im asking
you think a red blood cell is a prison for a gang member
very funny mr
if i learned anything useful in my classes id be rubbing it in your face
in scotts usual spot is amanda and tommy
have a good weekend
mine was good too
get any good birthday presents
she gets up and leaves the room
by the way max what ever happened with that girl you were seeing
she just ended a long relationship and she doesnt want anything serious
cant you have something thats not so serious
no its dead
and the thing i dont get is it was all going so well
there was a moment when we kissed when it was more than a kiss
his openness is making the other guys uncomfortable
it was like we broke through all our layers you know all the manners and defense mechanisms and daily crap and i saw a flash of something a glimmer of
hope or happiness or whatever something i inspired in her
but now its over and ill never see that part of her again
i think youre upset about not seeing some other parts of her again
the joke is half hearted max has made everyone reflective
shes a girl max
theyll always be a mystery
youll never know why they love you and youll never know why they dont
relationships are incredibly complicated
like polypeptide strings
theres an attraction at first but if the bonds dont form right away nothing can make the connection work
theres a metaphor we can all relate to
it was like with jen and i
but i know it was for the best
i finally dropped out of the play i was directing just to get rid of sara
god my career is in shambles
tough week all around huh
how about some video hockey
max gets up and puts on his coat
i think i prefer goldeneye
sam sighs and picks up the remote
wanna watch sports center
i think im gonna call sara
he gets up and leaves as sam registers this news
he puts the remote down
it is moist and foggy as max trudges across the deserted campus
max stops in the middle of a path as beth walks up
happy valentines day
yeah i hate valentines day too
if youre in love youre in love
and if youre not who wants to think about it
i want to be in love so badly dont you
you know theres this joke
ah forget it max
you know the joke
does a bear shit in the woods
yeah thats the one
you told it the night of our date
i hate that joke max
its not a philosophy
but i think i know what it means now
yeah and its dreary and depressing right
not this time
beth i just want to say before its all over and i dont have the chance that im sorry
last semester and last year
beth is speechless she never though shed ever hear that
you mean the world to me and i was an idiot to throw it away
you were right if i cant be a friend to you how could i be a boyfriend
ive done a lot of things wrong and ive been confused as hell but i think its time for a change
beth looks him over as if for the first time
then allow me to recommend a movie that youve never seen before
its called annie hall
i was going to see it tonight
do you want to join me
i would love to but i think you need to do this alone
no youre right
but ill see you later
after the movie im doing my last radio show
its going to be all requests
you should tune in
the end of an era
the start of a new one
he smiles and walks away
the fog begins to obscure him
beth opens her backpack and removes a walkman
she hits power and the led changes from tape to radio
contd and thats how i let go of her
although its probably more honest to say that she let go of me
julie beth and annie
three women in my life and i was desperate for one
beth stands alone watching him go
she snaps the headphones over her ears
contd of course i saw her again
its a small campus
the last time was at a film festival
were better friends now then ever and theres always a chance we can have some kind of future together
so far so good
finally beth turns and walks away
cut back to max still walking getting smaller and smaller
soon all we see is fog
contd shell always mean a lot to me and its nice to run into her and reminisce about what we ya know went through
it was a weird period of my life
i mean shit i really got off track there didnt i
