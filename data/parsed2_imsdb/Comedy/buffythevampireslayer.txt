buffy the vampire slayer buffy the vampire slayer by joss whedon we see an italian village at the height of the plague
funeral processions decrepit houses with their windows boarded up
the stench of death all around
through the filth a knight walks his horse
he is weary but not so dingy as his surrounding a stranger in these parts
he comes to an inn where a boy takes his horse round back
he enters the inn
the inn is dark and almost empty
a couple of patrons drink silently at tables
behind the bar stands a slovenly barmaid dark haired and lazy
she scratches at her shoulder on which we see a birthmark
the knight approaches the bar throws money down
a tankard of ale wench
the barmaid pours him a cup of ale
he drinks deep stands a moment
continuing some plague were having huh
the barmaid leads the knight by candlelight upstairs to his room
the door opens inward
the knight stands in the doorway places a hand on the barmaids hip
she pauses a moment then breaks free of his grasp starts down the hall
he laughs a bit resignedly and closes the door
a vampire stands behind it
not two feet from the knight grinning at him
his eyes are skull hollow and dancing in his head his bloody smile full with teeth
his skin is gray and peeling
the knight turns slowly and sees him
oh my god
the vampire licks his lips
he is on the knight in a second pushing him backwards into the middle of the small room
the knight struggles but is no match for the vampire who buries his face in the knights neck
the knight screams
it suddenly flies open the lock shattered
the vampire turns like a frightened animal
in the doorway stands the barmaid a slayer
in her hand is a wooden stake
the vampire drops the knight who crabs backwards into a corner
the slayer and the vampire come at each other
the slayer spins and kicks the vampire flies back
snarling he comes back at the slayer
they struggle he slips free and is out the door
for a moment the slayer remains still crouched on the floor
the knight watches her
she seems to be making a decision perhaps even knows what is going to happen
she runs at the window
the vampire comes running out the front door
before he is a few feet from the front of the inn the slayer smashes through the upstairs window and lands on him
they both hit the ground and she plants the stake right in his heart
after a moment we hear a voice the lord giveth and the lord taketh away
she looks up
continuing all fall down there are ten or more vampires walking slowly toward her in the otherwise deserted street
at the front maybe ten feet away is amilyn
amilyn is a grinning jackal a servant to the vampire king
his garb is a rotted approximation of a courtiers livery
he ambles toward the slayer giggling as she stands
behind her is lothos the vampire king
his skin is deep white and smooth
he wears a long coat his dress is not of any era
he is practically upon her before he speaks
you must forgive amilyn
he tends to drool before supper
he smiles almost lovingly
you people will never learn
she swings at him but he grabs her arm
amilyn laughs obnoxiously
lothos grabs the back of the slayers head brings her to him in a loving embrace
continuing we cant be stopped
this is our world now
he pulls her head back swiftly snapping her spine as her head hits the back of her legs
lightning flashes outside the window
it is torrenting rain
an old man speaks to a hysterical girl of sixteen or so
they are both obviously noble of birth
you know you must
there is only one
now you are that one
it is time
she has died
you are the next to be called
why do you think you were sent to me
trained as you were
you bear the mark
he pulls aside her blouse to reveal a birthmark on her shoulder identical to the barmaids
continuing the mark of the coven
i dont understand
ever since adam and eve first left the garden he followed the serpent
he sends his legion in the shape of men to feed on us to breed his hell on our earth
they are a plague upon us
the man unravels a satchel of cloth
from it he pulls an elaborately carved wooden stake
continuing but as long as there have been vampire there has been the coven the line of slayers
ones with the strength and the skill to kill them to find them where they gather and stop the swell of their numbers
one dies the next is called
im just a girl
you are much more
he hands her the stake
she feels the fit
continuing one dies the next is called
as she grips the stake more tightly an awareness and sense of power sees to fill her
she lifts the stake over her head
the hand is lifted high but it is not the girls
it holds not a stake but a pom pom
opening credits over a football game in progress
the stands are pretty full the crowd enthusiastic
the hemery football stadium is just that a real stadium not just makeshift stands on grass
on the sidelines are the hemery cheerleaders led by buffy
she is blonde in nature as in name pretty and very gracefully athletic
she obviously enjoys what she is doing and shes good at it
with her on the squad are jennifer and nicole two of her best friends
beside them the coach yelling at the players
the scoreboard reads hemery vs
on the field are jeffrey wide receiver and buffys boyfriend andy quarterback and grueller the huge left tackle
buffy and the crowd wince as andy is sacked for a nine yard loss
come on do the play
the one where
the one from the book
where you make it go forward
the players huddle
all right guys come on
he hits gruellers helmet
fill that hole
they were all over me
lets run twenty two
grueller close the pocket watch out for thirty five
thompson run the post right wide out
jeffrey go up the middle and run around like a chicken
they clap and break
as they line up jeffrey looks over at buffy
she smiles at him
he winks very suave
hes our man
if he cant do it we dont want it
on the hike andy drops back and looks for a receiver
jeffrey runs in circles like an idiot and not unlike a chicken waving his arms until andy sails him the ball and he breaks for a touchdown
the crowd goes wild particularly buffy who does an impressive standing backflip
nicole looks at her impressed
buffy smiles at her giddy
looking around is that good
was that a good thing
the mall is typically busy
buffy nicole jennifer and kimberly can bee seen making their way through it
they are all dressed very similarly bright colors a lot of white and pink
not trashy but mainstream and uninspired
all of them carry shopping bags theyve done a good days work
the girls pass by stores vaguely window shopping
howard is so heinous
hes always giving me a hard time
i get a c plus on the test and he tells me you have no sense of history
i have no sense of history
he wears a brown tie
you got a c plus
i cant believe i cheated off you
excuse me for not knowing about el salvador
like im ever going to spain anyway
a dress on a rack outside a store has caught her eye
she takes it and holds it in front of her
wouldnt i look just edible and nutritious in this
kimberly and jennifer catch up to them
guys whats the sitch
modeling the dress for kimberly what do you think
buffy puts it back
what are we doing
why dont we see a movie
they dont even have dolby
they show previews for foreign movies
and the ushers are like the acne patrol
were thinking pavilion
were going pavilion
whats playing there
a stranger walking the other way bumps into buffy doesnt stop
a man of about fifty he is dressed shabbily in a wrinkled black suit and a black shirt
he somewhat resembles a priest
continuing excuse much
not rude or anything
calling back nice ensemble
what a homeless
the girls continue walking
the man stops turns to stare after them
his look is intense slightly worried his face somewhat haggard
intelligence shines through his eyes
he holds himself stiffly arms close to him almost as if he expected something to strike at him
this is merrick
he pulls a picture out of his coat pocket looks at it
looks at them
the film is in progress
this has no effect on the girls however as they continue to talk ceaselessly
they all have diet sodas
to buffy so is jeffrey really spending the night at your house
thats the plan
your parents are always going away for the weekend
youre so lucky
maybe not yeah i guess
my mom doesnt go anywhere
she even does the shopping network
im gonna die a virgin
what did jeffreys dad say
just remember youre in training son oh god
he is so bald
seated a few rows behind the girls are pike and benny
the are fairly punked out and not currently attending high school
pike is long and lean has short hair spiked and a taste for long coats and black
benny is somewhat stockier opts for a shaved head and suspenders
doc martins for both
benny is clearly the more belligerent of the two when pike speaks its with surprising wit and reserve
will you guys shut up please
it could happen
pike and benny throw popcorn at her
take a chill lozenge
like we dont have rights too
i cant believe these people
we paid money to see this
no we didnt
but i still want to know what happens
everyone get horribly killed except the blonde girl in the nightie who finally kills the monster with a machete but its not really dead
the boys stare at her
oh my god
is that true
what movie is this
fat and yellow behind the clouds
we hear a long howl
jeffrey pulls into the parking lot in his bmw convertible
grueller howling sits in the back behind jeffrey and andy
they park and hop out head toward the entrance
look at that moon
come on guys we gotta do something tonight
you know if you would spend more time at home sleeping you would spend less time on the field sucking
you were a bone out there today
anyway im booked
gonna spend some quality time with the little woman
coughing it into their hands pussy whipped
you guys are pathetic
later for you then
andy you coming
no ill hitch a ride with jeffrey
andy and grueller bring their foreheads together with painstaking slowness grimacing and barely tap heads
grueller walks off head through a park
at the same time pike and benny emerge from the theater
they pass andy and jeffrey and the two pairs circle each other almost growling eyes locked before pike and benny turn and walk off not quite in the direction grueller
buffy kimberly jennifer and nicole come out right after
buffy heads straight for jeffrey and they kiss massively
jeffrey i dont mean to sound sexist or anything but can i borrow her
youd get her dirty
off her look he would honey
hes an animal
grueller walks through the trees enters an enclosed clearing of grass
he hears something stops
maybe his name maybe just the bushes rustling
he looks about him hesitantly
starts forward stops again
who is that
dont mess with me man ill rip your head off
continuing come on come out here
lets see what you got
continuing forget this
he turns on his heel ready to drop all show and bolt
wally bessel is right behind him
wally is a ninth grader small nerdy and recently undead
in marked contrast to the older vampire in the prologue wally is freshly undead
he still has fat on his face in fact he looks almost normal from afar
but his inhuman eyes and his uncommon pallor mark him as a vampire
and the way he speaks is unearthly
hollow almost detached repeating phrases sometimes almost as though he had never heard them before
he smiles at grueller
what are you doing here
what are you grinning at
you think i was scared
you think so
grueller grabs wally by his shirt collar and readily hoists his small body up wallys feet dangling two feet off the ground
listen you little worm
i could beat your head to a pulp for you just like i did last year you got that
you got that
repeating got that
he lets wally go
wally remains two feet in the air
gruellers eyes go wide
continuing what the
wally smiles even more broadly quietly hissing
he has long fangs made somehow more grotesque by the fact that he also has braces
wallys hands vise onto gruellers head lightning quick
crossing a street turning and listening
speeding by everyone packed into it
andy howls back at grueller mistaking his intent
he settles back
the girls are looking at him
you had to be there
in the front seat next to jeffrey buffy winces slightly
yeah im okay
we see another full moon this one on the tv screen
dracula is on lugosis original
the lights are off in the living room as jeffrey enters from the kitchen sits down on the couch holding a bag of munchies
buffy is still in the kitchen making corn
jeffrey flicks the remote changes channels
the movie is replaced by the local news in mid broadcast
a newscaster sits at his deck a super of a teenage girl behind him
the fourth such disappearance in less than two months
the sheriff was not available for comment but a police spokesman issued a statement saying that the situation is not out of hand
buffys father walks purposefully into the kitchen holding a suitcase that he plops by the front door
he crosses out again as buffys mom crosses in also with luggage
were gonna be late
i knew it
to buffy but not looking at her now well be back on sunday numbers on the fridge dont drive the jaguar and tell consuela my underwear does not go in
shes already out again by the end of this as dad comes back in
have fun be good stay away from the jag
and hes out the back mom entering on his heels
well thats everything
she actually makes a kiss noise at her daughter
buffys mom heads out the door as buffy heads into the living room
calling out bye bye bobby
to buffy they think my names bobby
its possible they think my names bobby
real quality timers hugh
something like that
hey it works for me
if they want to leave you alone in the house all helpless and vulnerable
buffy sits squints disapprovingly at the screen
she has a bag of microwave lite popcorn and is spraying diet butter substitute on it
what show is this
its the news buffy
whos in it
off his look i know what it is
its whats on instead of the movie
i just want to see the basketball scores
over a handful of popcorn mmmnkay
jeffrey leans in toward her
of course there are
he starts kissing her about the face and neck
she leans submissively back on the couch as he works his way on top of her
he gives her a long kiss on the mouth then works over to her ear
as he is burrowing about in there buffy sneaks another handful of popcorn into her mouth
she leans back by accident on the remote
not by any stretch an upscale joint
dark cramped and scummy
a young chinese whore sits on a bed wearing little enough that we can see the telltale birthmark on her shoulder
a repulsive british sailor is dressing his business finished
looking disgusted he throws his payment on the bed
for some reason the bed is littered with popcorn
you never touched my heart
alone the girl hears a noise in the dark corner a wet rustling
slowly she gets up to see
it is a pool of blood
she stares at it terrified
a hand reaches out of it
she runs out into the hall but it leads nowhere but a dead end
standing there waiting for her is lothos
he smiles at her and we see she is now buffy
buffy is thrashing in bed
jeffrey is holding her by the shoulders and shaking her
hey whats the sitch
she wakes grasping her eyes melting into focus on jeffreys face
you were having a nightmare
he settles back down his arms around her and almost instantly begins to fall asleep again
continuing whatd you dream about
come on what was it
it was just a dream
dark cavernous walls hewn from rock lit torches clamped to them
cold stone floor and in the foreground a dark pool of blood
a hum possibly a chant fills the air
a figure steps up to the pool his back to the camera and kneels before it
he holds his hand over the surface of the blood
as he speaks his voice an urgent hiss we track around him see that it is amilyn
you have brought us here and we thrive
you will awake in a new world
just as i promised untold splendor rubies dripping from our lips
just as we said
a hand shoots out of the pool and grabs amilyns
amilyn leans over and fervently kisses it
buffy sits with nicole jennifer kimberly and cassandra
cassandra is not quite in the same league as the other girls for one thing she studies
shes not as glamorous nor a vacuous
they consider this a moment
are there any good sicknesses that arent too depressing
im telling you its totally key
the earth is in terrible shape we could al die and besides stings doing it
i thought he was doing indians
jeffrey and andy arrive sit
jeffrey straddles buffy from behind wrapping his arms around her
she snuggles in his grasp
shyly hi jeffrey
whatchya guys doing
the winter dance
we need to come up with a theme
the senior dance
our friend the beer
putting out for fun and profit
try new clue flakes
it has to be like a socially conscious theme
reading from a memo one that reflects the students growing awareness of and involvement in the world around them
i still say the environment
thats my suggestion
it is a pretty crucial subject
see cassandra likes it
cassandras my friend
i like it
can i be your friend
stay away from my thang
to buffy sorry honey
thats cool with me
so what are the most immediate threats to the world environment right now
cassandra has paper and pen is poised to make a list of suggestions
the other all look at each other uncomfortably
cassandra obviously knows the answer but regards her friends silently waiting to see what the come up with
everyone but cassandra is impressed by this
to cassandra write that down
okay what else
helpfully okay guys how about the ozone layer
we gotta get rid of that
gary murray a well meaning but pompous little administrator come up to the kids
hes kind of like charlie brown you always say his whole name

the first bell was saying start going to class its time to go to class
in about thirty seconds the second bell is going to be saying already be in class

gary murray walks off
man has a complex
hes got a
what do you call it
a napoleonic code
its cause hes so tiny
yes but what he lacks in height he makes up in shortness
they get up and start heading to class
lets meet tonight okay

cassandra you gotta come too
the normans and the saxons
blow it off
i really cant
besides its pretty interesting
not harshly youre weird and im afraid of you
seriously cassandra theres a lot cooler things you could be doing than your homework
like my homework
buffy smiles trots off
we see shots of the deserted city at night
its a small upscale town
suburban streets businesses and a few more depressed areas boarded up houses
no one is out
trees rustle shadows flicker but the curling mist is the only visible presence
a classic faux fifties l
pictures of frankie and annette bright lights those same tired fifties standards playing on the jukebox
buffy kimberly jennifer and nicole are sitting at the end of the counter at the corner
i dont see why we have to invite everyone
kimberly its the senior dance
if we dont invite all the seniors we cant use the school funds you know that
cant they make exceptions
shes such a scud
cant we have a maryanne clause
well look whos here
pike and benny have entered the diner quite drunk
as they pass the jukebox benny gives it a kick and the music stops
a few people look up annoyed as they approach the counter
the fifties are over
earnestly we have to learn to let go
dont give me any trouble okay
we just want to eat
they sit next to buffy and begin pooling their money on the counter
it comes to about
heavy with pennies
continuing come on come on fork up the scub
thats it man
thats the whole story
were looking at a dog possible coffee
he digs and produces a quarter from his pocket
continuing its coffee
to the other girls smell of booze much
to the waitress can we have a hot dog please medium rare and a cup of joe
you guys are thrashed
to buffy what are you talking to them for
to buffy what did you say
yeah were drunk
were the drunks
whats your name
do people ever call you buffy the buffalo
im just wondering
buffy gives him a look
continuing the dont
you kind of wish they would though
this is benny
pike isnt a name
its a fish
hey wait a minute
youre the guys from the movie
good naturedly we hate you guys
the girls all make sad noises real sarcastic
continuing you guys were way rude
it was shocking
you just snuck in anyway
so you have to ruin the movie for us
you know other people have feelings too
i am so sure
the waitress brings the hot do
benny takes it out of the bun and holds it over his crotch phallus like
hey buffy you hungry
i got something for you
the other girls look down and shriek
buffy looks at benny looks at him in the eye
it closes silently around the knife at her place
buffy is still looking at benny she seems to be hypnotizing him and maybe even herself
the noise in the diner seems to fade away for a moment
buffy shifts slightly almost a twitch and the spell is broken
the sound returns buffy looks away letting go of the knife exactly where it was
benny looks down
his hot dog has been sliced neatly down to about an inch
he is shocked
she wasted my dog
smiling bummer metaphor
buffy looks off a little surprised herself
pike and benny have left the diner and are walking down the street
pike produces a bottle of mezcal from his coat pocket and takes a swig hand it to benny
they continue to pass it back and forth
theyre a plague
theyve gotta be stopped
you didnt like them
theyre all the same
theyre so stuck up theyre just
theyre not even human
i hate them
would you sleep with them
well there it is isnt it
you dont even like them and youd sleep with them
whats that all about
i got a news flash man another shot of this and ill have sex with you
oh yeah and then youll never call me
they continue walking
a shadowy figure appears behind them following
the girls have all finished their sundaes
come one that was so weird
uncomfortable what its not weird
i just cut the stupid hot dog in half
i cant believe they still ate it
to buffy whered you learn how to do that
i didnt learn
its not a big deal
buffy im gonna tell jeffrey you were playing with another mans hebrew national
annoyed get a boob job
its like when we took gymnastics in eighth grade
buffy makes a face
she doesnt want to hear this story
we hold on her as nicole tells it
buffy was on the uneven parallels she was really good coach said she could have been in the olympics but she was doing a routine spinning and the beam broke
buffy was you know on the upswing and i swear to god she went across the room
perm over heels
oh my god
no wonder you quit
well thats the thing
she landed on her feet
didnt even sprain a toe
and i go up to her and she turns and looks at me and shes like this she makes a hyper intense face
the others laugh
continuing like shes gonna kill me
i was just scared is all
it was mondo bizarro
buffy the ape woman
that look was way twisted
what were you thinking about
perhaps in answer we see the same shadowy figure moving behind pike and benny as they continue to walk home
theyre really bombed now
they are somewhere in the hills now and they come to the edge of a steep incline overlooking the valley
a waist high concrete wall is built into the side of the earth
they stand below a thick green tree
ill have it running in a week
its be beauty
it just needs new shocks you know break pads an engine and some wheels
itll be totally cherry
pike finishes the bottle eats the worm and chucks the bottle over the side
there is a moment before they hear it shatter
when you get your car together man lets bail
lets bail this town
i dont know
lets go somewhere where there arent any rich bitches
our own world where we could live and grow beans
hundreds of beans
benny wavers catches hold of pike
i think im gonna ralf
he leans over the side of the wall hangs his head down
dont worry benny
im here for you
pike falls over backwards
continuing im here for you ralf
pike passes out
still waiting to throw up
the figure approaches slowly from behind him
the figure is a few feet away from him when a hand shoots down from above and grabs bennys face
amilyn sits on a low branch pulls benny up to face him
amilyn has changed his manner of dress drastically
he wears a motorcycle jacket and sunglasses
his hair is punked out
benny is in shock as amilyn holds him easily by his shirt collar
you wanna go for a ride
amilyn leans back all the way back falling back out of the tree and pulling benny with him
we see them fall out past the wall just as the shadowy figure reaches it
it is merrick the man from the mall
he runs to the side of the wall looks over
the two are already lost in the dark mist
merrick turns around looks about him
he digs in his pockets pulls out a cross and a stake holds them tightly
while digging he pulls out an old stained picture lays it on the railing
stake and cross in hand he stands by pike looking out at the night
it is a ten year old girl about to blow out the candles on her birthday cake
the cake reads happy birthday buffy
buffy nicole and jennifer and another cheerleader are practicing
what was the step after
the one from thursday
i never learned it right i dont think
buffy shows her
they do it together for a minute
that is so cool
thank you very much
nobody is even gonna look at the game
hey i was thinking for the dance what about a big sign that says dont tread on me
you know and a picture of the earth
dont tread on the earth
i dont get it
how do you not tread on the earth
i mean you kind of have to
i never thought of that
i gotta bail
you guys blow
im waiting on cassandra
shes gonna help me with my history
cassandras really smart
shes okay though
are you going out with jeffrey tonight
jennifer laughs uncomfortably
continuing dont worry jennifer
someday your prince will come
yeah just make sure you do first
lets go guys
the other girls leave
buffy is alone on the empty field
she looks around her
she starts doing a routine tentatively
then she runs toward the middle of the field and jumps flies into an extraordinary series of gymnastic flips and cartwheels
she rolls into one final flip a huge one and lands a perfect ten about three inches from merrick
she screams in surprise steps back
continuing god where the hell did you come from
you scared me to death
that was impressive
his accent is clipped british
i used to do gymnastics
are you looking for someone
im looking for you actually
am i in trouble or something
not at all
my name is merrick
i was sent to find you some time ago
i should have found you much sooner but there were
you should have been taught prepared
what are you talking about
ive searched the entire world for you buffy
to bring you
you mean like a trust fund
merrick looks at her
continuing i had a trust fund my great grandfather or maybe it was an inheritance cause hes dead and i spent it on shoes
you must come with me
its much too late already
you must come with me to the graveyard
wait a minute
my birthright is in the graveyard
youre one of those skanky old men that like attack girls and stuff
my um my boyfriend is gonna be here in about thirty seconds and hes way testy
you dont understand
you have been chosen
chosen to go to the graveyard
why dont you just take the first runner up okay
you must believe me
you must come with me while theres still time
time to do what
to stop the killing
to stop the vampires
let me get this straight
youre like this greasy bum and i have to go to the graveyard with you cause im chosen and theres vampires
does elvis talk to you
tell you to do things
do you see spots
i dont have time for your prattling
i have proof
you bear the mark
he steps forward and pulls the neck of buffys shirt aside revealing her shoulder
continuing the mark of the coven
the wheres the mark
there is no birthmark on her shoulder
he looks at the other one
continuing the mark of the wait a minute
buffy pushes his hand off her
you mean that big hairy mole
excuse me eeyuu
i had it removed
and like knowing about my big old mole isnt proof of anything except that its way past medication time
she starts to walk away
continuing just stay away from me okay
did you ever dream that you were someone else
this obviously registers with her
in the past
a magyar peasant
an indian princess
the last one hits the mark
i was a slave
i dont know
there was a big gram or something
and theres one im like a prostitute
oh my god
i never told anybody about this
i remember the one about the peasant too
god theres a bunch
is this like channeling or something
merrick rolls his eyes
continuing i had a dream once where i was
there was like knights in it and i worked in this bar
im always fighting
and theres a guy
hes not always there but hes horrible all white and hes always
trying to kill me
the name has an obvious effect on the girl
how do you know all this
i have to show you
thick and orange sinking beyond the hills
merrick leads buffy searching for a particular grave
i cant believe im doing this
i cant believe im in a graveyard with a strange man hunting for vampires on a school night
why didnt you ever tell anybody about your dreams
oh yeah tell everyone im crazy
buffy stops winces slightly
none of your business
this is it
buffy is standing on a freshly dug grave
the headstone reads continuing robert berman was killed three days ago
the body was found in the bushes out by the canal
extensive tissue damage tearing at the neck and shoulders
coroner thinks its a dog
you sit her
he points out a plot of ground about eight feet from the foot of the grave
buffy sits and leans against another stone
merrick reaches into his jacket pulls out a stake and a cross hands the cross to buffy
wait a minute
just for protection
you wont have to do anything
i just need you to watch
what do we do now
we wait for robert to wake up
merrick goes over to the other headstone crouches by it
do you have any gum
the last red glimmer disappears behind the hills
cassandra stands waiting for buffy
the sun is down darkness increasing
she looks at her watch and gives up heads for her car
her key in the door she hears a rustling behind her
looks slowly around
buffy sits fidgeting
playing with her fingernails
merrick stays in the position listening
a low almost inaudible moan come from under the ground
buffy sits up straight holds the cross to her
the moan becomes louder almost a scream
the sound is followed by the sound of fingers scrapping wood of wood splintering of digging
the moaning continues becoming eerier somewhat more articulate
buffy and merrick wait
finally fingers break through the ground and hold stiff in the open air
the moan becomes a triumphant hiss
the fingers clutch at the ground
robert berman pops halfway out of his grave like a jack in the box his face dirty and dead white
he sees buffy in front of him and he bobs toward her with a crazy grin stretching as to a mothers tit
merrick drops down behind robert and grabs him raising the stake
buffy watches immobilized
a pair of arms shoot up from the ground right under buffy
they grab her and pull her to the ground
next to her face the face of another vampire a young woman emerges grinning from the crumbling earth
buffy screams lustily and struggles to break free
merrick is momentarily distracted by this and robert throws him off and pulls himself out of the grave
merrick falls to the ground and his stake goes flying
buffy pulls herself out of the girls grasp starts running away but the girl grabs her
buffy remembers the cross in her hand spins and holds it to the vampires forehead
it burns and the lady lets go screaming and falling to the ground
they are struggling several feet away
robert grabs merrick by the shoulders and picks him up preparing to bite him
a stake suddenly pops out of his chest planted in his back by buffy
he falls and dies
wheres the other one
she it leaps at her screaming
she throws it off as merrick produces another stake and throws it to her
buffy sticks it in the vampires heart
she dies screaming her face still smoking blood spurting onto buffy
buffy looks at herself
at the blood
merrick walks buffy to the door
she is silent slow
go to school tomorrow
try to act normal
dont let anyone know whats happening
this is important
when the vampires find out who you are
you wont be hunting them anymore
he hands her a piece of paper
meet me at this address after school
i have cheerleading squad
merrick starts back down the path
continuing they cant come in right
unless you invite them
is that true
merrick moves on
buffy goes inside
buffy shuts the door turns to go up to her room
she is startled by someone standing in her path
she almost screams
its her mother
she stands arm akimbo looking very confrontational
buffy looks a sight and stands uncomfortably in front of her mother for a moment
do you know what time it is
mom taps her watch annoyed
i knew this thing was slow
she crosses out of the room
continuing you pay a fortune for something
calls out honey come on were gonna be late
her mother gone buffy lets out a small sigh of relief or frustration it is not clear
she heads upstairs
buffy stands at the sink washing her shirt
she tries to get the blood off with fierce intensity
she is near tears
she sits in the middle of the bed in her pajamas the blankets pooled around her
she cannot sleep
finally she lies back on the pillow
lothos is beside her
buffy walks through the hall slowly obviously the worse for last nights wear
gary murray comes up next to her looking at his watch pointedly shes late for class
he moves on
jeffrey going the other way stops next to her
hey baby how ya doing
you look beat
i guess i do
where were you last night
i called your house like four times
i went to sleep
i think i have the flu or something
jeffrey backs away from her
i cant get sick
you know training and all
im gonna be late
jeffrey moves off to class
buffy walks on a bit
she bumps into nicole
you look thrashed
you and cassandra get anything done last night
buffy looks confused for a moment then remembers
she never showed
she is waking up obviously from being knocked out
she blinks stupidly looks around
she is lying by a pool of what looks to be dark water in a large cave
torches burn around her
she tries to get up and finds it difficult
she pulls herself up to the side of the pool and splashes water on her face
she starts staring with growing horror at her hands
she does not even see the figure rise from the pool at first
he wears no shirt only white trousers and boots the style maybe nineteenth century
no blood seems to touch him as he rises
he looks at cassandra with an almost sleepy lust
i find it restorative sleeping in the life blood of so many
to feel their souls coursing about me
what do you want
smiling so very much
my parents have money
yes im sure they do
this place is everything you said it was amilyn
amilyn stands behind her grinning
he hisses bares his fangs at cassandra
are we so strange
so alien to you
ive seen this culture the wealth the greed the waste
its truly heartwarming
the perfect place to spread my empire
honestly eastern europe was so dead the communists just drained the blood out of the place
its livened up a bit in the past few years but its nothing compared to this
this mecca of consumption
the city of angels
he steps right up to her
continuing what are we
we are man perfected
we exist to consume
on the world to consume we see amilyn mouthing the words with lothos his eyes to the ceiling
hes heard this a hundred times
do we change this one or do we just drain her
cassandra pulls her gold card out of her wallet
my gold card
ill never report it
amilyn snatches it from her looks it over
she has a certain quality this one
amilyn bites the card
i dont think this is gold
not as single minded as the others not as sybaritic
i can be dumb
or mean or whatever
i can learn
swear to god
he rips out her throat tearing at it with his teeth as blood gushes around their faces and she wriggle twists dies
he hurls her into the door and wipes blood from his mouth
i wish you wouldnt mention him
slowly cassandra slides down the wall her eyes glazing over
as she descends we see stenciled on the wall hemery high school
grey dusty and long since abandoned
sunlight pours in through the large windows practically caked with dust
old crates are stacked here and there bits of manikins leaning on one or two
merrick sits on a crate reading the newspaper
buffy enters hesitantly puts down her bookbag next to a pile of merricks stuff including a rolled up sleeping bag
this is definitely not her turf
she runs her finger along a crate picks up a world of dust
she holds up her finger at merrick
fire the help
merrick looks up at her
its not pretty but it does suit our purposes
she repeats it not with attitude but a dull wonder at her connection with this strange man
she crosses to him
continuing what um
what do we do
theres a great deal i have to show you im not even sure where to start theres so little time
why do you keep saying that
do you know what a vampire king is
a vampire king
you mean like dracula
and the man from your dreams
they travel about usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork
the vampires find a community and they feed on it make it their own
you were difficult to trace and i think the process has gone a lot further than id anticipated
usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy
but for some reason nobody here seems to be paying any attention
not paying attention what
annoyed well cover it later
i still dont get how they happened to come to my town
i mean was i born here because
because they were coming here
that lothos guy and his buddies
in a way yes
your fate is inexorably connected to them
first i have a birthright now ive got a fate
hey do i have to take notes on this
put down his paper were going to have the work hard
youll need some excuse for staying out
for your parents
not a pressing issue
i tell you the best thing i can do right now is find out more about you
what your strengths are your likes
whats your best subject
yes you used to do gymnastics
but you stopped
well everybody says
its just kind of dorky
i mean have you ever seen a gymnasts legs
theyre like indicating huge the mighty oak
its not a look
but you enjoyed it yes
i do cheerleading now
its way cooler
sporting events yes
sporting events yeah
why dont you show me a cheer
it would be interesting
a nice cheer
buffy starts a bit awkwardly doing a cheer
continuing who we gonna beat
pathetically following her motion who we gonna beat
stops no you dont have to oh
you lead me no
you dont do anything
i do it
she starts again
who we gonna beat
who do we defeat
who will we be pulverizing into cream of wheat
gradually buffy gets more into the cheer
the steps become more complicated as she repeats the verse
we see a knife slip out of merricks sleeve
he palms it hands behind his back
in the middle of her routine he hurls it at her
she catches it reflexively inches from her face
then bursts into tears
merrick is thrown off by this reaction
oh what the hell is wrong with you
you threw a knife at my head
i had to test you
but you threw a knife at my head
and you caught it
only the chosen one could have done that
i dont want to be the chosen one okay
i dont want to spend the rest of my life chasing after vampires
i just want to graduate from high school go to europe marry charlie sheen and die
it may not sound too exciting to a sconehead like you but i think its swell
and then you come along
and then im a member of the hairy mole club so you throw things at me
she is coming at him now
he begins to back up
it was necessary
realizing last night
you knew i was sitting on a fresh grave didnt you
i dont think you understand the full implications of buffy punches him in the face
he goes flying a good ways lands on his back
his nose bleed merrily
getting up dont you see whats happening
youve got powers youve only just begun to tap
physical mental prowess youve never dreamed of
pulling a handkerchief out of his pocket god this hurts
ive administered a few shocks to your system to start the adrenaline working
im sorry i have to take so many shortcuts in the training process
put your head back
two days ago would you have even hit me
let alone so powerfully
i guess i would have gotten jeffrey to hit you
youre becoming something extraordinarily powerful
buffy looks at the knife in her hand
the music comes up and we
buffys period of training
over the difficult course of it she is obviously becoming more self possessed more at ease
her style of dress loosens a bit a little punkier
stops dying her hair blonde and her roots start showing
accumulates a few more holes in her ears
buffy doing a series of gymnastic flips swinging on vines etc
buffy arriving late for class
buffy charging some books lawsons treatis on demonology psychological interpretations of vampirism the book of the dead and the complete garlic cookbook
merrick sits on a crate reading the obituaries and circling certain entries
buffy stands on her head sweating with concentration
the camera tilts up to reveal her feet
between the toes of one is a nail brush with which she is very carefully painting her toenails
amilyn and a few of the old world vampires are on a spree trying on various leather jackets
as they cavort the camera tracks behind the counter where we find the clerk bloody and dead slumped on the floor
buffy kissing jeffrey goodbye after school
a long lingering kiss during which she pulls away anxious to get going
she starts off comes back and plants a big ol on his lips one last time before splitting
merrick and buffy are playing
merrick tees off shoots horribly
as announcer ooh another embarrassment for the teabag while the chosen one is still well under par
buffy positions herself
what about bats
do they turn into bats
no bats no flying
not really flying
were there ever any like famous vampires
lucretia borgia joseph mengele franklin pangborn
are any of those names familiar
if i say no does that make me a bad person
what do you study in history
she gives a little isnt that funny kind of laugh
he doesnt respond
youve heard of the emperor caligula perhaps
or jack the ripper
they were vampires
she considers this a moment
tees off another hole in one
buffy and merrick sparring working their way in between the trees
she is his superior in speed and strength but he easily trips her up
she glares at him from the ground
buffy late again
gary murray watches her from the hall shaking his head
two college age guys stand hitchhiking
a red convertible pulls up with a beautiful blonde behind the wheel
the guys look at each other all right
they cant see her teeth or the look in her eye
buffy walks in looks around
she approaches a priest
yes my child
is something troubling you
well sort of
well maybe i can help
could you bless these
she holds up a six pack of perrier
we see the entire cave the still pool of blood the torches lit
at the far end sits lothos
in his arms is the body of a dead girl
blood stains her neck and yet the image is poetic reminiscent of michelangelos pieta
they are both perfectly still her draped across his lap he with his eyes far far away
the silence holds
lothos belches massively
merrick is lecturing buffy
buffy is sitting doodling in an open notebook uh huh ing and obviously not paying attention
lothos was probably born in the eleventh or twelfth century hes been difficult to trace
his power has increased with age
it will be a long while before you are ready to face him
well be lucky if we can get him to leave the area to lie low for awhile
that will scatter the rest of them
he looks at buffy who is staring down at her notebook
continuing is extremely powerful but he is still a vampire and vulnerable to the same
he looks at her
is she listening
continuing daylight is still his enemy
the stake can still find his heart
continuing i have huge antlers growing out of my buttocks
no reaction just another uh huh
merrick slams a stake right through the middle of it
buffy screams jumps back a good two feet and lands on her butt
try to pay attention
buffy drinking coffee trying hard to stay awake
buffy in class taking a test
nicole leaning over trying to cheat off her when she falls forward onto the desk asleep
buffy being ushered into gary murrays office
buffy sits in his chair
gary moves about his desk sitting behind it leaning on it talking to her
a fly buzzes annoyingly about his head
well i think we can safely say that somethings going on with you buffy
now theres nothing to be nervous about youre not in any trouble
i just hoped maybe we could talk
dont think of me as gary murray administrator
think of me as gary murray party guy
happening dude who can talk to the young
me and you
its drugs isnt it
buffy stands under a tree blindfolded
merrick stands a ways apart watching
buffy stands very still neck craned waiting
silently a leaf falls
it wafts gently down
buffy hurls a knife at it with easy precision
the knife stick deep into the trunk the leaf perfectly pinned
merrick looks at it
buffy smiles knowing she has hit the target
blindfold still on she turns toward merrick and walks into a branch falls heavily backwards
the same session continuing
buffy still sits expressionless in the chair
the fly still buzzes
hey theres nothing to be afraid of
i know where youre coming from
ill tell you the truth
ive had my drug experiences too
i did a lot i did some acid in the sixties
well the late seventies actually
it was at a doobie brothers concert
buffy at the mall with kimberly nicole and jennifer
for the first time we really see how she stands out against her friends
she is wearing much more functional cool garb and less makeup while they still sport the same dainty shit from the beginning
they stop to look at some dresses
something in the next store catches buffys eye she wanders off
gary murray is crouching on his desk
buffy still sits
the fly still buzzes
as gary talks buffy picks up a push pin from the table beside her holds it
and i could see the music flowing into me it was bright red and electric and i felt like a big toaster and i thought maybe i am a toaster
were all molecules and my friend melissa her head looked like a big party balloon and that scared me i started to freak out
buffy surreptitiously puts the push pin in her mouth
the other girls are moving on from the dress shop notice buffy is not with them
they spot her in the next shop urge her to come on
buffy puts back the chain saw she was looking at follows them
buffy hasnt moved or opened her mouth
the fly buzzes on
gary murray now sits behind his desk
i guess youre surprised
well you know theres more to most people than meets the eye
everybodys got a secret
i just want you to know that you can always share your secrets with me
what you say in this office it will stay in this office
im your pal
buffy smiles at gary
as he looks away for a second buffy spits out the push pin
the buzzing stops
buffy sparring with merrick again
she holds a stake
this time she ends up pinning him the stake at his solar plexus
he moves the point to where his heart would be
the room is a shambles
outside the first floor window it is dark night
help yourself by the posies blasts from pikes stereo
pike lies on his bed
through the window we see benny approach slowly fading up to the pane
hes floating really
hes a vampire
he scrapes his fingers on the glass
pike sits up turns down the music
he goes to the window begins to try to open it
benny man where you been
you bailed on me i passed out man i almost did a jimi hendrix
let me in
hey im trying but this window is burnt pike gets a good look at benny for the first time
invite me in pike
wait a minute
whats wrong with you man
you look like shit benny
benny grins presses his slimy forehead against the glass
no offense man but i think youre on something nasty
why dont you just go and cool out and ill see you in the morning or something
he laughs at his impression brown spittle caking the window
continuing let me in pike
get away from here
i mean it
benny smiles moves suddenly out of sight
pike looks at the window for a second then bolts out of his room
he runs to the front door frantically hooks the chain
benny appears at the doors little window banging and scraping the glass
pike backs away
buffy walks slowly down the street trying to appear nonchalant but looking about her a lot
sure is cold
what a dark night
nice night for a walk
she whistles some keeps walking
continuing feelings la la la la feelings
boy im helpless
she passes an alley and there is a rustling amid the garbage cans
she moves slowly down the alley toward the noise
she is about halfway down when a rat scurries out from the cans and down a drain
behind her another sound
she turns slowly
at the entrance to the alley stands a vampire
they stare at each other some thirty feet away
she moves back a step
the vampire takes a step
continuing what do you want
it floats rapidly at her hissing
buffy looks about her frantically trapped
it hits her at top speed and she instantly rolls onto her back flipping it and hurling it against the wall at the end of the alley
as it hits buffy still rolling produces a stake from her jacket and throws it directly at its heart
the stake punctures the startled creatures chest
before he can so much as grab it buffy throws a roundhouse kick driving the stake all the way home with her foot
the vampire screams sinks to the ground
buffy turns triumphant
continuing toaster caked him
a hand stops it
it is merrick who steps into the alley and stares at buffy
the two exit merricks car an old dodge dart
as they talk they make their way into the warehouse
buffy looks out for trouble while merrick unlocks the door
this is obviously their routine
he was slow
they wont all be that easy
and the alley was a mistake
never corner yourself like that
if theyd come at you in force youd be dead now
one vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten
does the world duhh mean anything to you
you felt a little sick didnt you
they enter the warehouse
they unload their stuff as they argue
yeah i felt em a little but i aint due for two weeks since youre so excited about the subject
a reaction to their presence to the
unnaturalness of it
its part of how you are able to track them
my secret weapon is pms
thats just great
thanks for telling me
youll get used to it
im more worried about your tactical mistakes
you are such a wet
didnt i just kill that vampire
i think i did
i didnt see you killing any vampires
you were too busy playing beat the clock
dont start with me again
arent i like the chosen one
the one and only
the grand high poobah and doesnt that mean you have to be nice to me
and why are you always wearing black
its so down
its totally not your color
i dont think you have a color
what do you want
in bad american accent gosh buffy youre so special i just want to give you a great big hug oh im just having a warm fuzzy
oh fuck you
merrick turns on her
do you know how many girls ive trained to be slayers
five properly prepared girls girls who faced their responsibilities who worked hard to become women overnight harder than youve ever worked in your life and i saw them ripped apart
do you want to live
what did you think that being able to jump about and hit people makes you a slayer
buffy looks at him a bit
so basically ive got the life expectancy of a zit right
not if youre careful
how can you keep doing this
its what i was raised to do
there arent many of us left the watchers
theres a small village in hampshire near stonehenge
sees she doesnt know it near a bunch of big rocks
thats where i was born
my father taught me about the training about finding the slayers reading the signs
theres a small cluster of us a few families really
most of the neighboring villagers think were just a bunch of harmless old loonies
i thought so myself for a time when i was younger
stops himself im sorry
im not supposed to
i shouldnt go on like this
i wish you would
it isnt important
im curious is all
dont start thinking of me as your friend
it interferes with the work and it
and it makes it worse when i die right
continuing well you know im not gonna kick so easy
ive got a few things the other girls didnt have
as for example what
theres my keen fashion sense for one
vampires of the world beware
you made a joke
are you okay i mean do you want to lie down
i know it hurts the first time
in spite of himself merrick smiles
buffy nicole kimberly and jennifer are walking down the hall
so they found cassandras body out by the railway tunnels
nobodys saying anything but they think she was involved in something like illegal or something
well i hope so
what do you suppose she was doing out there
coming from the opposite direction are jeffrey andy and some of the other football players
theyre suited up and heading for the gym
and theyre having some memorial service or something tomorrow
i dont know
coach said i had to work on my abs
coach knows what abs are
they pass buffy
andy stops and grabs her from behind
continuing got to get some
unthinkingly buffy flips andy over and pins him against a locker
i dont actually need any right now
to buffy whats with you
dont grab me okay
i see now the error of my mistake
yeah keep your mitts off my thang
ill pop you one
to buffy did he scare you
jeffrey puts his arm around buffy but she shakes it off
i can take care of myself jeffrey
so i noticed
buffy goes off by herself
jeffrey watches her
continuing nice to feel needed
lets move out
the lads move off
we see nicole kimberly and jennifer who have been watching the whole exchange
nicole and kimberly are obviously disdainful of buffys behavior
jennifer is feeling sorry for jeffrey
boy does she want him
a mod brightly lit store
a little hipper than your usual mall fare but not melrose either
bright colors reign
buffy is standing by a dressing stall inspecting her fingernails talking to merrick as he changes inside
i mean most of the time jeffreys really sweet but sometimes he gets kind of
me tarzanish you know what i mean
lately it bugs me i guess
no response merrick
are you still breathing
from inside i cant work this
we call them zippers
theyre not supposed to be a challenge
but its in the back
why are we wasting time with this anyway
because you clash merrick
you clash with everything
i mean you might as well go around with a sign slayers trained her
honestly you look like something out of
my clothes have always been perfectly serviceable
well youre on my turf now
youre just gonna have to trust me
merrick comes out of the booth
he wears multi colored parachute pants and an equally loud t shirt
buffy looks at him he looks at himself
i want to die
doesnt like it either okay
the important thing is not to panic
pike is hurriedly working on a part in the hood of his beat up dodge which is filled with all his belongings
zeph stands watching him
zeph is about forty five greasy good natured
pike works for him
you said youd have the part by two
christ its almost dark
pike finishes slams the hood
he picks up a battered guitar case and stuffs it into the car shuts the door
what nasty bug crawled up your bungus and where the hell are you going
im leaving man
im bailing town
this place has gotten way too hairy
where am i gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money
hey have you seen benny lately
you want me to give him a message
you should think about leaving too man
sell this place
somethings going on here
i dont know
something real weird
pike gets in the car
it sputter starts
ah youll be coming back
i dont think so
take care of yourself
what should i do if i see benny
pike peels out
zeph watches him go
thats my guitar
on the edge of town
the car has stalled at an intersection
pike is hunched over the wheel his head down as he listens to the rasping engine
come on come on
dont leave me baby
come on breathe
amilyn appears in the street in front of the car
pike finally hears the scraping of his feet as he approaches the car
pike straightens up slowly and as the rear view mirror comes into the frame we see there are two more behind him
they are both high school age fresh like bessel and benny
they all approach slowly
pike waits for a second his hand on the key
continuing this is for the money baby
make me proud
he turns the key again and the car roars to life
the headlights trap the hungry scowl of the vampires as pike pops the car in reverse smashing into the back two vampires
they both go flying hurt but not killed
pike races at amilyn but he leaps up as pike reaches him and pike hears a thud as amilyn lands on the roof of his car
pike continues to bullet down the street as a hand suddenly punches through the roof grabbing at him
he fights off the hand and tries to control the speeding car
it cant be done he goes off the road and into a park
the car careens along
amilyn ride it laughing
pike spots a tree with a low branch and heads for it
still fighting he aims at the branch
it gets closer
amilyn looks up
they pass under the branch and we hear a tearing thud
the arm stiffens and falls into pikes lap
the car hits another tree dead on
pike slams into the steering wheel
the guitar case flies right through the windshield and lands on the grass
pike pulls himself slowly from the car
he is bleeding but not badly
he hears a low seething wail from a few yards back and turns around
amilyn is getting shakily to his feet
oh give me a break
amilyn hisses at him then turns and races away snarling clutching whats left of his arm
one of the other vampires nears him
pike tries to run and his knees buckle
he lands on them right next to the guitar case
as the vampire nears he pulls the guitar out of the case and swings it hitting the vampire in the head
he hits him again
the vampire bats away the guitar and grabs pike
brings his face to pikes as pike squirms
a blasting kick in the head from buffy
the vampire is flung to one side falls
he starts up at buffy and she nails him with a stake
pike stares at her
she pulls a walkie talkie from her pocket
into walkie talkie im on the east side near the playground
she puts the walkie talkie back
is that your car
i think its pretty much ready for the the last vampire hits pike from behind
without missing a beat buffy picks up the guitar and snaps the neck off
she and the vampire meet in the middle the creature barely moves before she buries the guitar neck in its chest
merrick runs up
he is wearing black jeans and a windbreaker
he is more modern than he was before but subtly
he sees the decaying bodies one with a guitar sticking out of its chest
i kind of had to improvise
to pike sorry about your guitar
umm listen im not
i have to fall down now
pikes eyes glaze over slightly as he collapses into buffys arms
thrashing about the room in hysterics screaming and snarling banging his one fist on the boiler tank
it booms hollowly
lothos grabs him throws him up against the wall
whats wrong with you
he took my fucking arm
you let him have it
lothos lets amilyn go
amilyn still fumes quietly
continuing you reckless imbecile
this place is ours for the taking and you let yourself
twelve hundred years old and you act like a child
i had him in my grasp
you may still
only lothos smiles at the joke
amilyn raises his stump looks at it
the tattered end of his jacket covers the grossness of it but it still isnt good
forlornly i look horrible
the other two the new ones
where are they
i dont know
but the boy he couldnt kill them
not a boy
gathers himself find out if theyre dead
and do something about that arm
honestly i dont know how you made it through the crusades
he turns toward his chamber
continuing let me know about our little recruits
ill be in my chamber
on his way through the door he passes a box on an oil drum
he plucks a large kitten out of it
continuing having a snack
buffy and pike walk in pike still a bit unsteady on his feet
how are you doing
oh im good
kind of miss my knees though
you want some water or something
they move into the kitchen
continuing do you do this kind of thing a lot
i mean is this like a hobby
they were vampires werent they
buffy hands pike the water and they move back into the living room
pike curls up in an armchair by the window
buffy begins stripping off her bloody clothes leaving on a tank top and jeans
you had a car full of stuff
were you leaving
yeah i was bailing
i have a friend and hes really
well hes really vampire i guess
well stay here tonight
tomorrow morning im on a bus
where are you gonna go
well ive always wanted to see oxnard
as buffy strips down to her tank top she notices a gash on her arm
its not bleeding much any more but its fairly impressive
pike jumps up to help as she pats it down with her shirt
continuing hey jeez are you okay
you need a hand
it doesnt hurt
pike looks at her a moment as she wraps her shirt around it
almost awed who are you
buffy doesnt look up
the questions seems to upset her a great deal
she even fights back tears
continuing im sorry i just mean
well you seemed like such a flake
but in a good way
i can just keep talking till you strike me dead or
buffy smiles at this though still upset
she sits down
things are kind of confusing
ill back that up
three weeks ago all i thought about was
well i didnt actually think about anything
i definitely didnt expect this
my guidance counselor never mentioned anything about vampires
prison came up a few times but nothing about undead
i went back to my old grade school once to the playground i used to hang out there all the time playing on the swings and stuff
i went back and it was so tiny the whole place
i couldnt even fit on the swings
everything just looked so small
collects herself im sorry
no youre not
but she stands anyway head to the stairs
im kinda beat
you can stay in my moms room if you want
i think ill just hang out here
make sure the sun comes up and everything
oh ill be fine
got my chair got my window im great
she starts up the stairs
you know you saved my life
and i just wanted to say
i forgive you for talking during the movie
she gives him a look heads upstairs
he watches her go looks out the window
a bus is pulling out
we see pike through the window looking comtemplative
he watches the terminal disappear
the streets move by
on one there is a police officer talking to a hysterical man
next to them is a body covered by a sheet
buffy and merrick are walking along the path to the steps of the main building arguing
merrick is wearing casual california gear but again very subdued
there isnt time
make time okay
youre the one who told me to act normal
ive missed three practices already
if im not there for the barber game tomorrow everyones gonna talk
its not right
why because its not my fate
its not in the book of all knowledgefullness that im gonna be cheerleading at the barber game
sooner or later youre going to have to accept it
im pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore
come on merrick
afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left
you should come its gonna be a great game
oh ill be there all right
im not letting you out of my sight
not till youre ready
try and be inconspicuous okay
act like a fan
being a fan football is my life
slowly incredibly slowly but youre learning
she turns to go
none of the other girls ever gave me this much trouble
and where are they now
she smiles at him and runs up the steps where jeffrey is waiting for her
he looks at the departing figure of merrick
so thats your tutor huh
what is he like your boyfriend now
they enter the building together
right before the game
the scoreboard reads hemery vs barber
fans fill the stands
we see buffy with the other cheerleaders
shes really into it enjoying herself as they all rally the crowd
we see merrick taking a seat
he is wearing another new outfit a letterman jacket and baseball cap
he has binoculars around his neck
he takes his seat amidst the teens
the coach is giving players his pep talk
some people say winning is a state of mind
cant win out there if you dont win point to his head in here
i say winning isnt a state of mind
i say winning is having more points
and how do we get point
by putting the thing the ball over the
in the place
so i dont care about your minds
maybe youre tired
maybe youre worried about your grades
maybe you dog just died or youve suddenly found that youre attracted to other men
i dont care
cause were a team
and there only on thing that matters to a team
and how do we win
by putting the thing in the place
so lets go
they run out full of fire
the coach turns to one player whose face we cannot see
there you are
you missed practice again
youre benched till the fourth um the fourth part
now get out there
coach heads out
the player turns around smiles after him
the players run out toward the field yelling
the last of them is grueller
he floats behind them slowly grinning and speaking in a passionless voice again as if he were repeating words phonetically
go team go
the scoreboard read hemery barber
fifty seconds left
who do we emasculate
on the sidelines a player hobbles out and coach pushes grueller in
he passes buffy and she winces slightly
it messes up the routine and nicole practically falls over her
you know these steps
buffy starts cheering again as the players huddle
he is watching buffy through his binoculars
a teen nudges him
hey can i borrow your binoculars man
without looking around no
youre checking out the cheerleaders
merrick does turn
what about her
everybody knows about her man
knows what about her
the teen leans closer
shes had sex
he nods at merrick you know what i mean
merrick turns back
im on the wrong bloody side
the players are lined up
grueller at left tackle smiles at the player facing him growls
the player looks worried
the players scramble as andy hands off
the carrier gets a few yards
when the pileup on the line of scrimmage peels apart the player that had been facing grueller is unconscious
as he is carted off the field grueller gleefully trots back to the huddle
watching the game a little perplexed
merrick watches buffy
the coach yells at the players
do the thing
go towards the guy
throw the thing
smiling listening to andy call the play
kimberly sits complaining to no one in particular
what are they doing
the clocks running out
shouts throw the ball
she sits back turns to her neighbor
are they so brain dead
her neighbor smiles at her
he is a vampire and he speaks in the same monotone that grueller used
he waves a pennant
the players are lined up again
grueller is drooling
the other team is really worried about him now
andy drops back and lobs it to jeffrey
jeffrey is way open
he catches it easily looks behind him as he runs
barber players are rushing at him
and grueller is coming at him too throwing other players right and left
jeffrey looks a little worried
he bolts down field toward the end zone grueller on his heels
she sees something is definitely wrong
in a flash she races onto the field
what is she
he stands his eyes following buffy
she also see buffy
shes really lost it
everybody rises to their feet and cheers as jeffrey makes it to the end zone
two one zero
grueller hits jeffrey a second before he is enveloped by other players
grueller hungry with bloodlust is confused by the exultant crowd snarling at people
buffy races for the crowd
she sees jeffrey is all right
grueller makes his way out of the throng and up into the stands even as everyone else is rushing onto the field
jeffrey is triumphant
he sees buffy running for him and raises his arms
she passes him right by and continues after grueller heads up the stands
he looks after her confused before he is swamped again
he tries to make his way through the crowd
grueller reaches them and leaps over the back
buffy sees him runs up and without hesitation dives off herself
the stands reach some thirty feet off the ground
buffy sails down like a diver grabs a branch about halfway down
she swings like a gymnast and the branch snaps
still holding the broken branch she completes a perfect flip and lands on her feet
the vampire fan is on the ground behind her come for her and without stopping or even turning she twirls the branch and sinks the broken end in his heart
she looks around for grueller
he is booking out already several yards away
merrick appears at the top of the stands just in time to see buffy take off after grueller
calls as she runs he knows who i am
she continues to race after grueller
running back down the stands making his way through the dispersing crowd to the nearest exit
buffy is still following but she cant keep up
she spot a biker tooling along the street on a harley
she comes up to the side of the road and tentatively sticks her thumb out
the biker smiles stops in front of her
ground level behind the bike we see its engine revving smoke puffing from twin pipes
you want to get some real power between your legs
buffy looks at the biker a moment
the same angle as before ground level
suddenly the bikers body lands in front of camera spinning revving the engine
buffy takes off at top speed
youre a dyke
im telling the world
a rustling in the trees signifies gruellers flight
seconds late buffy roars into view behind him
she navigates the streets with less ease than determination
her eyes follow him off the road and she steers the bike on a violently bumpy and erratic course through the site
she finally hits a pile of bricks and is thrown headlong from the bike
she hits the ground hard she rolls into it but has trouble getting up
gruellers smiling face appears over her
fall down go boom have to see the nurse
grueller god what did they do you
he brings his face right next to hers
his voice is no longer passionless it boils up from hell
they killed me
he grabs her and hauls her up
she head butts him with enormous force sending him staggering back
before he can recover she dives for a pile of discarded lumber chooses a nasty shard of wood
she turns on grueller who is smiling again
there are two more vampires approaching her surrounding her
the master walks tonight
this is his kingdom now
they rush her
she takes one on as the second hits her knocking her over
they all three swarm over her meeting her kicks with raking claws
the two hold her in front of grueller
continuing you know buffy ive always wanted you
he smiles again and leans toward her neck
the stake that pops out through his chest is as much a surprise to him as it is to buffy
he falls backward shocked and dead
behind him stands pike
one of the other vampires stupidly goes after pike who runs away
buffy instantly flips the other one over onto grueller impaling him as well
pike runs more or less in a circle yelling the vampire at his heels
i didnt mean it
i didnt mean it
wooden shard in hand buffy sprints toward them jumps into a series of flips
she lands with her legs around the vampires shoulders plants the stake in its heart as they topple onto pike
for a moment pike and buffy lie on top of each other breathing hard
then they get up awkwardly embarrassed by their touching and by their slight arousal
i didnt expect to see you
whyd you come back
i dont know
i kind of thought i ought to be here
you know this isnt exactly the kind of thing you can run away from
besides oxnard sucks
they start out of the site
continuing listen i
i really do want to help
i mean these guys are dag nasty and somewhere my best friend is out there and id like to i dont know
even the score
do some damage
im good with damage
she drives by see buffy with pike
its an eyebrow raiser but she keeps driving
pike i dont think youre up to this
i think i could help
you gonna tell me you dont need help
merrick runs up to the street where buffy took the harley
he has shed the raccoon coat
the biker is still there standing in the road trying to thumb a ride
did you see a girl come by here
you dont mean like a cheerleader
yeah i saw her
bitch took my wheels
shes a lesbian too
she told me
which way did she go
the camera pans with merrick as he takes a step in that direction leaving the biker behind and momentarily out idiot girl
cant watch over her
how long ago did the camera pan back with merrick as he turns to the biker but in his place stands lothos
not five feet from merrick
oh my god
on his knees lothos hand firmly locked around his throat
he cannot move or breathe
merrick and lothos look at each other a moment
its a beautiful night
i have never understood the human tendency to equate darkness with emptiness
to me the black is so thick with life like soil
darkness writhes under my eye
he looks at the night
merrick slowly reaches for a gun stuck in the back of his pants as lothos continues
continuing i know who you are
shes out her as well isnt she
who is it this time
what offering have you brought me
she is crouching on the ground holding her stomach and gritting her teeth
i think its him
not answering merrick
buffy ups and runs in the direction of the noise
calls back to pike
continuing stay here
she runs out of sight
lothos lets him go and he falls dead
it doesnt really matter
the names the faces they all melt together
after a time there really is no difference
one more pathetic bitch begging for me to suck on her clotted heart
this one may surprise you
merrick holds it firm behind his back finger on the trigger
i rather doubt it if she was raised here
he doesnt appear to have noticed the gun but continuing where is she
i cant wait to meet her
do you think shes ready to face me
or perhaps you can stop me with that gun
merrick looks out at the trees nearby
buffy appears far away between the trees
merrick looks at lothos afraid he will notice
approaching stopping some twenty yards away
she looks about her for a weapon
look at you
you pathetic thing
so small so full of fury
after youve served me for a hundred years i think youll have a little more perspective
i dont think so
lothos rushes suddenly at merrick hissing his feet just off the ground
merrick steps back whips out the gun and shoots himself without hesitation in the head
buffys eyes go wide
lothos growls holding merricks spurting corpse
a small involuntary noise escapes buffy
even twenty yards away he hears
he spins and stares starest at camera
buffy walks slowly silently backward fading back into the dark terrified and shocked
lothos turns back and looks at merrick dead in his hands
disgusted he lets him drop
he looks at the blood on his fingers
after a moment he tastes it
pike is standing by the trees where buffy stood before looking out into the street
the same angle as buffys before
now lothos is gone
buffy is kneeling quietly by merrick holding his head in her lap
through the dark mist buffy appears carrying merricks body in her arms
she is alone
she does not stop
on the outskirts of the graveyard buffy finishes filling in merricks grave under an old tree
she is still wearing her cheerleader outfit now caked with dirt
she stands at the foot of the grave tries to think of a prayer
ummm our father who art in heaven duhmm
hallowed be thy name
uhh kingdom come daily break i dont know
i dont even know if youre religious
you probably are
but youre dead you know
youre just totally dead
she sits heavily on his grave
continuing and i dont know what to do
you were the one who
i dont know if the training was over
i dont even know if i passed
youre so stupid
how could you be so stupid
what am i supposed to do without you
you son of a bitch
she stops looks down for a moment
pike is at work on a contraption
built out of scraps and parts it is the beginnings of a cartridge load crossbow
zeph watches behind him
hah id knew youd be back
didnt i say youd be back
ha ha ha
youre sitting in your old car saying nope im never coming back
like you got anywhere to go
im never coming back but i knew you would
birds got to return to the nest sooner or later
thats what i said
just like i told you
pike pays no attention to this babbling monologue
over the course of it he takes a slim handmade wooden shaft slightly thicker than an arrow and rubs it with garlic
he places it in the crossbow take aim in front of him
he fires into the tire of a truck
the tire pops flat
zeph cracks up
shot the damn tire dumbass didnt even look just going around shooting things popped it flat ya bonehead
pike still not listening continues to work
we see a banner stretched across the central beam of the ceiling
it reads the earth is our home
a half dozen inflatable globes dangle from the ceiling
nicole and kimberly are stetting up the drinks table unloading and stacking hundreds of styrofoam cups
jennifer crosses by them carrying an armful of plastic wrappings and containers
i got all the plastic stuff
what should i do with it
you idiot throw it out
jennifer crosses out as the two resume their conversation
i really was way way too too
when she ran onto the field in the middle of the game
was that the most out of it thing ever or did i blink
im like yelling at her what are you doing
and shes going jeffrey jeffrey
jennifer is the first to see buffy walk in looking cleaned up but still ragged
they stop laughing
you were supposed to be here at three
buffy what is your sitch
youre acting like the thing from another tax bracket its too weird
look a lots been going on
thats what i wanted to tell you guys about
i need to tell you
a while ago i met this guy oh my god youre having an affair

like people disappearing people turning up dead
what are you talking about
you mean like you hanging out with that homeless poke
i saw you last night after the game
youre having a fling with him
he doesnt look fifty
reality pulled out of her five minutes ago
oh thank you very much
like youve got a grip
youre so out of it
youve blown off cheerleading youve blown off dance committee excuse me for having something important to do
this isnt important
the earth is our home
kimberly its a dance
its a stupid dance with a bunch of stupid kids that i see every stupid day

this isnt just any dance
it happens ot be the last dance of our last year
except for prom

and the january semi formal okay
you want to play house with the unwashed masses thats fine
but personally i think you ought to spend a little time prioritizing
i really do
listen to you
what language are you speaking
get out of my facial
she storms out
well i guess you got what you came for
later for it
she also leaves with jennifer
buffy stands alone in the room small amidst the streamers
buffy stands at the sink rinsing a glass for way too long staring
her mother breezes through the frame
dinners in the fridge stay away from the jag well be back by twelve
she stops seems to notice something about buffy
continuing buffy honey
wanting to talk yeah
have you gained a few pounds
maybe its that outfit
whats bobby gonna say
i dont know mom ive never met bobby
laughs arent we the chatty ones
and shes out
buffy looks at her clothes herself
pike drives slowly between the cars
he sees buffy walking toward the mall
he pulls up by her parks
gets out of the car
buffy hey ive been looking all over for you
buffy doesnt stop
he paces her
continuing i been working on some stuff for you
im going shopping
dont try to stop me
i could actually use a couple of allen wrenches
what do you need
for the dance
im going to the senior dance
charades second word
sound like dance
im going to the dance
in order to dance and to drink punch and to be with my friends
i dont believe this
the worlds under attack by the legions of the undead and youre going to a mixer
its not a mixer
its the senior dance
and its important
you wouldnt understand
you got that right
i thought you wanted to kill vampires
i dont want to kill anybody and i dont want to talk about it anymore
listen i know youre bummed about your friend and im really sorry
offhand almost disdainful he did what he was supposed to
but buffy youre the guy the chosen guy
im the chosen one
and i choose to be shopping
i should have known
buffy raises her fist at him he starts back involuntarily
leave me alone
benny was right
you guys are all exactly the same
buffy walks away leaving pike alone
continuing calls after her im not disappointed im just angry
as pike walks off the camera tilts up the lamp post behind them
benny is perched upon it
vampires are gathered around
lothos stands with benny
benny is beaming
lothos laughs long and hard
buffy looks at dresses most of them fairly tight and fairly out there
she holds one in front of her looks in a mirror
pike sits fiddling with his crossbow
looks out the window discontented
laid out next to him we see wooden shafts garlic and a cross
buffy lays her dress on the bed
we cannot see exactly what it looks like
she stuffs some blood stained clothes into a duffel bag along with some stakes
she tosses the bag in the closet
dozens of limos pull up
kids pour inside
the party is underway
streamers everywhere tables by the windows
couples dance a d
j spins the tunes
there is a setup in one corner for taking prom pictures
the kids are all very elegant and hip
every shade of black is represented
nicole and kimberly stand by the punch bowl chatting
they are both wearing slinky little black dresses
there are two at one end leading to the house its closed and one leading outside
gary murray stands by the outside door on guard as students enter
he is looking disdainfully at andy and holding a flask he has confiscated
well it came with the tux
buffy enters the gym
she is wearing a long white strapless gown
it is lovely but very conservative for this crowd
over her shoulder is a purse that goes with the dress
she enters hesitantly looking around her for jeffrey
she passes andy who is moving away from gary murray
have you seen jeffrey
but andy has moved on
buffy works her way through the crowd to the punch bowl sees nicole and kimberly
they stop whispering real quick
continuing hi guys
have you guys seen jeffrey
the limo never showed i thought he might be here
nicole and kimberly look at each other significantly
i havent seen him tonight
she picks up a glass of punch
continuing im glad you guys are here
its good to see you
miss sarcasm yeah whoops i came
tries again you look way pretty kim
i like your little outfit
its amazing what you can do with a parachute and some starch
as long as theres room for three in it
what didnt you bring your new friends
buffy is startled by this attack
i guess you guys are mad at me
ive been really jeffrey suddenly appears between them
jennifer is on his arm
there you are
i she stops as everybody assesses the situation
buffy is shocked doing a slow fade to hurt
jeffrey is uncomfortable
jennifer is apoplectic with embarrassment
kimberly is in serious giggle nicole a bit more restrained checking it out
buffy what are you doing here
i thought we were meeting here
im here with jenny
who is practically hyperventilating pulling at his arm like a dog on a leash
i dont understand
oh come on buffy
you know whats going on
its not working out at all
ive got to move on
i mean ive got needs too
i told you about all this
no you didnt
didnt you get my message
you broke up with my machine
you werent home
you left me a message
im out of here
at the mention of her name jenny jumps and in her haste to get away she bumps into buffys arm spilling bright red punch on buffys chest
she flees jeffrey in tow
they leave the gym
kimberly finds it all pretty funny
nicole is silent
buffy turns away toward the wall
a soft ballad come on over the speakers
tears are forming in buffys eyes as she wipes futilely at her dress
finally she turns looks toward the door
pike is there walking in on his own
he wears a leather jacket and baggy old tux pants accented by chains earring and unlaced doc martins
he looks great
he walks directly toward buffy and does turn a few heads
i crashed your party
pretty shallow of you
im glad you came
yeah you look like youre having a swell time
pike picks up a glass of punch as he notices the stain on buffys dress
he looks about him a bit then without hesitation dumps some punch on his lapel matching stains
buffy smiles at him
continuing will i get the shit kicked out of me if i ask you to dance
i dont actually think jeffreys gonna notice
they begin slow dancing not too close
yeah well youre the one im afraid of
they dance for a while closer and closer
continuing gee whizzically you know youre not like the other girls
buffy pulls him closer holds him whispers almost weakly in his ear
yes i am
we see couples dancing kissing
gary murray watching them
sitting by the window with her bovine date she watches buffy dance disdainfully
i cant believe it
the window shatters by her head a vampires hand reaching for her
she screams starts back
other windows shatter vampires appearing all around
a couple of students run for the inner door but it is locked shut from the other side
gradually the party stops as everybody becomes aware of the situation
they vaguely herd to the middle of the room
looking around assessing the situation
a student runs staggering in blood spurting from his neck
theyre out there
god help me
he falls to the ground a few feet in front of the doorway
nobody moves for a second
then one of the students starts toward the body
dont go near the door
buffy does instead checking the lifeless body and listening as a number of figures begin to lumber toward the door through the mist
buffy steps back as three year old vampire come to the door
its party time
they cant come in here
they cant come in unless theyre invited
i already invited them
everyone looks at her
continuing defensively theyre seniors
pike reaches into an inner pocket and pulls out a number of small stakes he has made hands them to buffy
she opens her purse
cosmetics hair spray etc
she fits the stakes in
the first thing we should buffy
you wanna dance
to buffy looks like youre busted
we want her
we want buffy
send her out
or we come in
they fade back almost out of sight
pike looks out the window
more are gathering
all right everybody stay calm
to buffy whats going on
looks bad buffy
send her out
theyll kill us
shes the one theyre mad at
send her out
everybody be quiet
what are you kidding
theyll kill her
theyll kill us
moving toward kimberly fist raised you want some punch
i got detention slips here im not afraid to use them
but other students have picked up the cry are clamoring to sacrifice buffy
pike crosses to his bag sitting by the door
two guys move toward buffy andy intervenes
pike steps in front of buffy holding his custom made cartridge load crossbow
trains it on the others
they quiet down
theres gotta be a back way out of here or something
buffy looks at the partygoers
they stare back at her scared angry
she looks out the door
back at her friends
im going out the front
are you nuts buffy
theres a hundred of them out there
theyll rip us apart
youre staying here
before he can speak some of them might not come after me
if they dont this place is gonna turn into a total stain
you say that like its a bad thing
buffy this is crazy
what do these guys want
andy start breaking up some chairs
youll need weapons
andy looks at her a moment moves off
buffy goes to pikes bag starts pulling out stakes
continuing good thing one of us was prepared
buffy theres no way youre going out there alone
buffy stands up
she kisses pike very hard on the lips
dont piss me off
she kneels down begins to rip the hem of her dress
we see the doorway to the gym
a mist has risen around the entire house swirling about the feet of the undead who stand clustered about it
some have keen and eager expressions some vacant half conscious with bloodlust
a figure appears in the doorway walking slowly out
her torn dress now comes to just above her knees
she wears pikes leather jacket over it
she wears her purse strapped across her chest under the jacket
in one hand she holds his crossbow in her other hand is a cross
as she steps further away from the doorway the vampires slowly begin to close around her
the door shuts behind her
kimberly and some of the others are anxiously barricading the door
pike looks out the window after buffy
to himself come on move
the vampires move closer and closer
they circle her
she waits apprehensive
when they are about eight feet from her she whips out a bottle of perrier
she sprays it all around searing the inner circle
screaming they clutch their faces
others are watching as well
andy comes up with some chair made stakes hands some to pike
buffy is defending herself in an astounding blur of gymnastics and martial arts
leaping throwing kicks punches and the odd stake she manages to scatter them enough to make a run for it
everyone is watching through the windows as the vampires follow after buffy
i think theyre going after her
almost as if it heard that one of the vampires turns toward the gym grinning hugely
it and at least half the others turn back toward the easy pickings inside
to kimberly ill bet you feel stupid
lets get away from these windows
find something to cover them with
students start mobilizing
bring round the table
theres nails and stuff we used to put everything up
andy and some others drag a table forward
pike helps hoist it up against the window
he looks one last time outside then covers it up
she heads toward the nearby cluster of school buildings
close behind are the undead
she passes a line of parked cars
jeffrey and jennifer are in the back of his parked bmw making heated clumsy love
we can see them through the window
make me a woman
make me a woman
as they are spouting this nonsense buffy zooms in and out of the frame behind the car
after a second she walks back into the frame staring at the two of them
pissed that was quick
looking up oops
she books out again the horde on her heels
jeffrey looks up and out the window
vampires swarm about the car in pursuit of buffy
jeffrey goes wide eyed at the sight
starts climbing off jennifer and into the drivers seat
terrified well im done
are you done
no okay lets go
but the car roars off
windows and the boards covering them begin to smash inward
a student pounding in nails is caught pulled out the window
a vampire crawling in is spiked by pike
another makes it in and is smashed on the head repeatedly by andy
it staggers smilingly and turns toward him
stab them in the heart
andy manages to shove the two by four in its heart just as it gets its fingers around his throat
one of them has hold of her starts pulling her out the window
nicole runs to her starts pulling the vampires hands off her
suddenly the vampire grabs nicole instead
off balance she is almost out the window before kimberly can react and all kim can do is scream
andy and pike make it to the window too late nicole is pulled out and they swarm over her
a vampire catches up to buffy
she shoots the last crossbow shaft at it
shucks the bow away as another reaches her
she wrestles with it fights it off but doesnt kill it
moves on as more approach
students are still holding most of them at the windows
one or two have gotten in
a junior vampire has snuck behind it and is going through the records
he stops finding one he likes and starts to put it on
music teen angel
it wafts over the carnage in the gym lending it a surreal and dreamy quality
hearing the music another vampire grabs kimberly and starts dancing with her
she screams a lot
its about to plant one on her neck when pike stabs it in the back
pike turns from the dying vampire and is face to face with benny
pike is frozen for a moment
buffy approaches the nearest building to the gym
the vampires are several feet behind her some twenty of them
the door is locked
she smashes it in with her shoulder
a few vampires are about to follow buffy into the building when a hand is suddenly raised before them stopping the
slowly they start fading back
it is amilyn
he smiles at the other vampires and raises his fingers to his lips
pike is slammed down onto it bennys face inches from his
teen angel has been replaced by some hard rock
isnt this great pike
isnt it great
finally got those bitches on the run
he hoists pike up and backhands him in the jaw sends him flying against a wall
pike shakes his head as benny comes at him again no longer smiling
continuing of course im angry
i leave you alone for five minutes and look who youre hanging out with
he turns suddenly and grabs a girl yells in her face
continuing i dont want girls with good taste i want a girl that tastes good
she faints and he drops her turns back to pike
pike is getting shakily to his feet
blood trickles down his forehead
continuing i was gonna change you man
i was gonna give you life
do you know what that means
gary murray yelling orders at student holding a board against a window as vampires pound on it
the exposed part of the window above him shatters raining glass on his head
a vampire is clutching a helpless girl as another vampire takes their picture with an instamatic
he expresses confusion and dismay when his image does not come out in the photo
pike is backing away from benny who is approaching him
pike passes an overturned table the stubs of its broken legs sticking up at the ceiling
never get kicked around never get busted
benny grabs him with hateful force
his fingers dig into pikes arms enough to draw blood
continuing it means never having to say youre sorry
and you blow it all off for that slut
what about my needs
pike suddenly grabs benny holds him tightly in a brotherly embrace
benny is thrown slightly by this
still holding him pike pitches onto the table driving the leg shard through bennys back
pike still holds benny as he twitches and screams dying
finally he lets go gets up
he looks a little dazed a little lost
a window shattering far behind him pulls his eyes back into focus and he goes to help
sitting by a wall tiny and silent amid the carnage
buffy moves quickly along crouching near a window and peering out
she looks about her waiting for an attack
she checks her purse
cosmetics and hair spray
a small cross
no stakes left
muttering under her breath she moves swiftly into a classroom
still moving cautiously she heads for the window and pulls down the shade
she crouches behind the teachers desk and pulls the chair down to her laying it on its side
cattily to herself ooh make me a woman jeffrey
oh jeffrey youre so atheletical
i love you
she slams her elbow down on the chair leg very controlled efficient motion and snaps it off
looks around to see if anyone is around to hear as she picks up the leg now a weapon
she goes softly to the door peers cautiously out
amilyns face appears right next to her also looking out
buffy screams turns and amilyn decks her sends her flying back into the classroom
the stake flies out of her hand
it lands on a desk by the window
buffy does not land nearly as well crashing into a pile of desks and twisting her leg badly
amilyn laughs repulsively advancing
pleased to meet you
wont you guess my kicks her hard name
defiantly through the pain it wouldnt be dick would it
he kicks her again
youre a fool bloodbag
die a fool and go to hell
he grabs her by the neck with his one arm and pins her against the wall in the corner
she reaches for the stake but it is just out of reach
he is squeezing the life out of her his face inches from hers
continuing the chosen one
youre just another bloodbag not even fit to die for the master
when will you ever learn
buffy looks about for succor
buffy eyes the bottom of the shade the pull dangling aimlessly
with difficulty i do know
what time sunrise is
she pulls down hard on the shade pull and lets go
he turns in horror letting go of buffy trying to catch the shade
the instant he releases her buffy grabs the stake and in one swift motion buries it in amilyns back
the shade goes up flapping loudly as it spins
it is still pitch black out
amilyn stare wide eyed and silent at the night as he dies
its in about four hours dick
amilyn spins dying rage in his eyes
he grabs her
his strength is formidable even as his body begins to smoke
suddenly screaming he forces her over suddenly with such power that the two of them go crashing through the floorboards
the two of them fall through the ceiling directly into the blood pool
amilyns body surfaces first now just a husk
buffy pops up from the waist deep blood soaked and wounded
she stays a moment breathing hard
suddenly her eyes go wide
oh god no
lothos rises from the pool smiling
buffy is clearly paralyzed by fear
i knew youd come
he moves toward her
continuing you knew it too didnt you
all your life dreaming
waiting to feed me
buffy is suddenly galvanized into action
she throws a few punches at lothos but he takes them without flinching
she grabs at the stake in what remains of amilyns chest
lightning quick lothos closes his hand around her and squeezes till the stake splinters and she screams with pain
he knocks her back on her ass
she starts moving backward away from him but it is hard enough for her to make her way through the thick gore
lothos contemplates amilyns corpse and his face darkens
continuing ah my fool is dead
he was careless always
still ill pull out your tongue for that
coming toward her dont you understand
ive killed you a dozen times
your life is not a blink of my eye not a single breath
i have lived in the shadows in the pulsing filth behind mens eyes
a thousand years and more
i have conversed with the worms that fed on my corpse and i have bathed in the blood of emperors
breaking the spell have you ever thrown up in the front row of a richard marx concert
and she is up turning to run
he is thrown momentarily by her insolence
but he is on her the moment she emerges from the chamber grabbing her by the hair and throwing her to the ground
you waste time
that is a sin
he kneels over her prostrate body
she is reaching frantically into her purse
he runs his hand along her body a gesture both lustful and disdainful
continuing youre even weaker than the others
i think youve forgotten something
she pulls out a small cross holds it in front of him
he snarls at it then grabs it his hand around her
the cross bursts into flame
he holds her hand onto it
this is you only weapon
your puny faith
with her other hand buffy holds up her hair spray
continuing my keen fashion sense
she squeezes it at him the spray catching fire form the cross and whooshes a jet of flame right into his face
he screams letting her go and backing up
hey his head is on fire
buffy turns and hobbles away
lothos stumbles about head all aflame till he finally pitches into the pool
buffy comes out of the boiler room and hobbles along moving as fast as she can
this is the suckiest party i have ever been to
its not even a contest
she reaches a locked door that says gymnasium authorized personnel only
puts her shoulder to it
as he pulls himself out of the pool we are treated to a good look at his new head
it is charred and torn almost beyond recognition
it is so inhuman looking that we are almost surprised when it screams
the scream fills the hall
buffy is still working on the heavy metal door
she turns wide eyed at the sound
we track rapidly through the cave through the boiler room the hall
were moving much too fast to be running
buffy pulls herself up through a trap door in the corner
for a moment there is silence
buffy gets shakily up
dont let her in
dont let her in
pike and the others see her
pike and andy run to her to help
continuing theyll kill us
get her out
gary murray stops in front of kimberly takes her face in his hand and lightly pops the back of her head against the wall
cross eyed she slides back down into comatic silence
are you okay
get away from me
she pushes them away
lothos crashes through the trap door behind her ugly and crazed
he picks her up floating a good two feet off the ground
he hurls her the length of the room
she hits a locker which opens spilling out someones notebook
the binder falls open inside it is a plastic pen case with pens and pencils within
buffy looks by this time like shit
she props herself up as best she can looks about her
there is nothing wooden nothing sharp within reach
continuing you would challenge me
andy charges lothos from behind
pike tries to stop him but is too late as lothos grabs him by the face without even looking at him
continuing to buffy ill rip the flesh from your stinking bones
squeeze andys head until we hear something crack
lets him drop
looks around at the cowed students
continuing i am a god
i am so sure
furious he charges buffy his feet just skimming the ground racing toward her violently fast upon her
she spins on her feet in a flash one quick motion
she thrusts her palm forward and stops him cold like superman stopping a train palm at his chest
buffy looks directly into his eyes the mad rictus of his face
lothos stops almost wide eyed as he looks down at his chest
sticking out of the middle of his chest is a small eraser and a
he steps back staring at buffy
the expression on his horrible face seems to have changed to one almost of respect
her look is unfathomable
lothos smiles graciously
as much as i had imagined
he falls gently to the ground
hes dust before he hits it
one by one the vampires stricken slip out into the night
kneeling by andys body
he gets up and walks toward whats left of lothos warily keeping his eye on the spot
in the background we see gary murray running out after a vampire
just a minute you
im not finished with you
pike kneels by the pile of dust with a pencil in it
everybody is looking at buffy
she stares back at the students who cast her out
turns and walks out
pike follows her
we see the direct aftermath the gym police cars people helping the wounded
over this is the voice of a reporter
the death toll now reaches twelve and a half in the tragedy of hemery high school
it was at the senior prom five days ago that the school was beset by a roving gang of crack crazed gunmen
survivors say some two hundred of the ruffians laid the school gym under a kind of siege claiming several lives in the process
said one administrator things here will never be the same
students walk holding their books talking
students passing notes yawning falling asleep
students window shopping sucking on slurpies laughing
shot from above the blue water filling the screen
kimberly dives gracefully into it comes up on the other side
kim climbs out and joins jeffrey jennifer and a boy and girl we dont know
they are all in bathing gear with fluorescent zinc on their noses
she was even crazier after that
i mean it you wouldnt even have recognized her
kimberly wrinkles her nose in distaste
she didnt even hardly talk to anyone in school
she didnt even go to the prom
i heard she got straight as
jennifer glares at him
continuing thats what i heard
the worst is her parents this is true her parents were gonna send her to the bahamas for graduation and she refused
she said she didnt want to go
it is to vomit
well where is she now
buffy and pike are walking up the elaborate stone drive toward us
we cant really tell where they are but there are trees hills in the background
buffy leads the way
she is confident at ease
she wears a large old sports jacket a baseball cap pulled backward
skirt and sneakers
casual cool but disarming
she carries a knapsack
i didnt say it was a bad idea i just said the timing was off
we could maybe wait till later
dont be such a fraidy cat
besides me i mean
weve come all this way
we just have to check it out
i got a hunch
youre the boss boss
i just thought maybe we should wait
buffy stops at a large elaborately carved door
she turns to pike
buffy grabs the large metal knocker ringed through a gargoyles mouth
and on the boom of the knocker we see the castle
archetypal turreted terrifying
standing lonely on the craggy hill drenched in the light of the rising moon
