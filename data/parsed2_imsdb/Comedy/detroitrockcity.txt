when its not gaudy tacky and loud its blander than toast
colors like lime green and sunshine orange should be reserved for popsicles only
bruce late s enters looking exhausted
she carries a glass of wine in one hand and a book in the other erma bombecks the grass is always greener over the septic tank
humming weve only just begun mrs
bruce crouches next to her wildly ancient entertainment center complete with track
she flips the first record forward on her ronco record mate
album after album flaps forward
olivia newton john neil diamond the osmond brothers
she stops on the carpenters and sighs at the serene cover art
just what the doctor ordered
placing the vinyl on the turntable she clicks the dustcover closed and flicks play
reclining in her lazyboy she sips her wine opens the book and awaits the mellow tones of karen carpenter
suddenly her eardrums are hammered by machine gun guitar
caustic rock n roll assaults her senses
she jumps spilling her wine all over herself
this isnt the carpenters
racing to the entertainment center she turns the volume control knob so violently it comes off in her hand
the music is even louder now
flustered by the awful noise she tries lifting the dustcover
she screams and covers her ears
this is hell
running to the rear of the huge console she stretches to reach the plug but cant
fingertips millimeters away
as the cacophony pounds she shakes the entire stereo with all her frantic might
the needle scrapes across the vinyl with a shrill finally coming to a stop
then pop the dustcover opens unceremoniously
shaken she grabs the record with trembling hands and reads the label
bruces blood boils
the devils music
a small two story house amid a suburban neighborhood of other two story houses
two car garage
a faint yellow glow emanates from a cellar window across which shadows frantically dart
over the crickets we hear inhuman
camera moves to the cellar window
inside we see four teenage boys who are to blame for the racket
an inner sanctum of kiss devotion
faux wood paneling is plastered with countless kiss posters pictures fold outs
the ceiling is wallpapered with more kiss posters
kiss dolls magazines records comic books clutter the shag carpeted floor
fast food wrappers heap over the kiss garbage pail
the four high schoolers rock their hearts out as they blast a familiar tune offensively off key
i wanna rock n roll all night and party every day
they stink but they sure are trying hard
meet the band mystery
concert tee shirts holey jeans total burn outs
hawk a scraggily haired disenchanted youth strains his vocal chords on the microphone as he scratches at his rhythm guitar
hawk is sort of the brains of this operation but knowing the others that doesnt say much
lex pounds a bass with earnest determination
lanky with bad posture lex is already sporting worry lines
he takes everything way too seriously
trip strums lead guitar like hes hammering nails
all id trip is slightly out of his mind
but is it the chemicals or just his chemistry
he always wears a knit cap
jam a sensitive kid but no wuss bashes on his drums like a madman making the bass drum pulsate like a spastic heart
the big drum bears the word mystery painted on its skin with a lightning s just like the kiss logo
they bring the classic tune to a shrieking conclusion and thrust their hands over their heads in the kiss symbol
hawk screams into the mike at their imaginary audience
thank you cleveland
youre a great crowd
but after three and a half hours of kick ass rock and seven encores on top of that im sorry to say that this time we really gotta get back
to our hotel rooms and fuck some groupies
behind him trip grabs lexs bass and swings it by the neck at an amp pretending to bash it over and over again
lex quickly yanks it away from him
what the fuck trip
thats my bass
jam emerges from behind the pile of drums smiling
that was curly
just one more day of school to get through girls before tomorrow night
getting excited cobo hall
like an announcer you wanted the best
you got the best
the hottest band in the world
they all make that breath sound that mimics a screaming crowd
suddenly headlights swing by in the window above them like a spotlight
lex hops onto the unmade bed and looks out the cellar window
a baby shit green ford station wagon with fake wood sides screeches into the driveway
bruce gets out and stomps toward the house
lex gasps at the sight
its jams mom
jam gulps as if hes just shat out an whole can of lincoln logs
whats she doing here
lex quickly throws a kiss towel over a tv tray hiding a bong cigarettes overloaded ashtray
trip kicks half empty beer bottles under the bed
hawk sprays lysol frantically around the room as jam shovels gum into his mouth
knock knock knock
bruce pounds on the cellar window crouching to see in
she looks like a crazed underlit psycho
muffled through glass jeremiah
you get out here this instant
the boys looks up like innocent wide eyed angels
oh hi mom
screams jam quickly pockets his drumsticks and grabs his worn denim jacket off the pile of jackets on the floor then runs upstairs
the others follow
the front door opens
jam steps out to greet his mom with a nervous smile
hawk lex and trip stand at a safe distance in the foyer behind him
bruce grabs her son by the ear and holds up the kiss love gun record waving it in his face
the devils body count thats whats up
dont you know what kiss stands for
knights in satans service
she hauls jam across the lawn
hawk lex and trip step onto the porch looking on in sympathetic embarrassment
bruce stuffs the record in the trash can then throws jam in the front seat
screech the station wagon pulls away
jam has yet to do an overnight with us
i had a nightmare once that something like this might happen
i hope he doesnt get grounded again
if he misses peter crisss drum solo i dont know if hell be able to handle it
lex quit trying to always jinx things
dont worry dudes
nobodys missing that concert tomorrow night
the love gun album sitting in the trash can
camera moves in on the round label till it fills the frame
the record begins to spin like on a turntable as camera descends into the little hole engulfing the frame in black
this leads us into
rock n roll all nite blasts the way its supposed to sound
the jammin kiss classic is accompanied by a barrage of quick cuts depicting kiss mania
kiss merchandise dolls lunch boxes clothes etc
we see the band do their thing in authentic clips from real the montage is a colorful kick ass kaleidoscope of the entire kiss phenomena
cut to the beat of this seminal anthem
the final image is the kiss destroyer poster
the suns early morning rays beam through the kiss destroyer poster taped onto a window shade
the phone rings
jam bolts upright his profile blocking the poster
he has just awakened under the only other decoration in his room a crucifix
still dressed in last nights clothes a plain black tee shirt and blue jeans jam leaps out of bed unwittingly planting a foot in the handle of a bullworker a
piece of exercise equipment comprised of a powerful spring with two handles on either end whose other handle is stuck under one of the beds legs
jam runs to a phone on his dresser drawing the bullworkers powerful springs out to maximum tension
no sooner does he pick up when he is yanked to the floor and dragged across it as if tied to the bumper of a speeding car
despite the bullworker pulling him back toward his bed jam does manage to get the phone to his ear
the phones cord stretches taut causing its cradle to leap from the dresser and whack jam on the head
hawk is on the phone as lex and trip scour every inch of the cluttered room on their hands and knees searching frantically for something
jam listen up
just listen up man cause we are in a quandary
jam clutches the phone with his shoulder grunting as he does battle with the bullworker for possession of his foot
are you on the crapper with one of those antenna phones
sounds like youre taking a dump the size of butte montana
its my bullworker
anyway listen up
the kiss tickets you nimrod
theyre just fuckin gone
please tell me you havem
why would i have the kiss tick
just check whatever you were wearing last night
jam briefly scans his surroundings double taking at the denim jacket lying on the floor
he checks the pockets and sees four tickets labelled kiss june cobo hall whew
oh god hawk
somehow i musta taken trips jacket by mistake
hawk sighs like a deathrow convict pardoned at the last second
to others hes gotm
lex and trip collapse with relief
trip he took your jacket by mistake
you must be wearing jams
trip reaches in a breast pocket and pulls out rosary beads
spooked he drops them like they were a bug
into phone cool
im really sorry about that man
dont be a fembot
so are you like grounded because of last night or what
of course but has that ever stopped me before
besides my moms going to some church meeting and wont be back till late
see you guys in school
jam hangs up
lex buckles his belt with its huge kiss belt buckle
poor jam man
imagine having to stash your kiss records inside carly simon album covers
no question mrs
bruce is a psycho bitch from hell
youre one to talk lex
your moms a fuckin dyke
trip pockets his wallet which is affixed to a long chain attached to a side belt loop
trip a female gynecologist does not a lesbian make
and even if it did at least my mom didnt give birth to me while she was on lsd
and even if it was lsd i can still give my mom a kiss without smelling the catch of the day
both you assholes shaddap
lex and trip shaddap
enough of the mom bashing all right
lexs mom is cool about us crashing over here while shes out of town
and if it werent for trips mom we wouldnta smoked that fine panama red last night
so leave the women who gave you life out of it
theyre both cool
trip and lex cease and desist the mom bashing and continue getting ready for school
suddenly lex pushes trip angrily
trip you fuckin asshole
lex points to a wet mess on the pillow
you spilled my sea monkeys all over the bed
jam gives the bullworker one final yank
this time it comes loose
not from his foot but from under the bed
its handle lashes up slapping him across the face
fully awake now jam throws on trips denim jacket
he stuffs a drumstick into his left sock
we see mystery written on it
just as hes about to stick the other one in his right sock
without a second of warning or even a knock mrs
bruce suddenly enters
immediately jam stands
jeremiah what are you doing
she turns to his closet the door blocking her view of the kiss poster
jam leaps to the window and yanks the destroyer shade
it shoots up flapping around its rod
hes done this before
bruce peeks at jam from around his closet door
he stretches in front of the window
youre going to be late if you dont hurry up and change soon
whats wrong with what i got on
its dirty laundry for one thing and for another you still havent worn the clothes i bought you
youre skating on thin ice already young man so i wouldnt push my luck
now get out of those rags
besides those jeans are so tight i can see your penis
jam reluctantly takes off the denim jacket as mrs
bruce grabs the single drumstick from his hand and shakes it at him
someday youll see the futility in forging a musical career with those idiots
she turns and rummages through the closet
to himself theyre not idiots
now dont forget youre on the honor system tonight
ill be home a little after one and if youve been partying or playing that satanic kiss music
well need i remind you of the consequences
grounded for the rest of the year
youre a smart boy jeremiah
and so handsome
she pulls two sears department store boxes from the closet and lays them on the bed
jam is visibly horrified
the suburban high school is teeming with morning activity
school buses pull up to the curb
kids arrive in droves and immediately find their cliques
the jocks and primadonnas make up the popular crowd
theres disco dudes freshmen who look like grade schoolers and geeks
at the smoking section hang the burnouts
hawk trip and lex stand amid the other long hairs
what a fuckin waste of time
two girls with tons of make up hair so feathered it could fly and tight clothes saunter by snapping gum
will somebody please tell those chicks disco is dead
i hate stellas almost as much as i hate dogs
same species when you think about it
their words say one thing but their eyes say another
they cant stop gawking at the chicks asses
girl sneers back
dont stare too long youll go blind
the boys quickly cover
defensive yeah right
look at that big ass
you know what they say about a big ass
just then jam steps off a school bus in an unbelievably geeky outfit white corduroy slacks plaid shirt buttoned to the top argyle socks and brown deck shoes
hey that dork looks just like jam
hawk and lex look and laugh when they see him
shit that dork is jam
to jam jam gives them the finger
hawk trip lex and jam grab books from their lockers
kiss stickers photos and rock magazine cut outs line the insides
jams locker door is covered with peter criss only
so jam who did your wardrobe tad the preppie sailboat captain
hey my mom had me over a barrel all right
after last night i had to let her dress me today
its a give and take relationship
yeah she gives you shit and you take it
gimme the tickets
i wanna hold onto them
theyre still at my house in trips jacket
she was standing right over me when i was changing for fucks sake
thats some sick shit right there
did she comb your ass hair for you too
if your mom so much as smells those tickets theyre history and we get screwed outta seeing kiss for the third year in a row the third year
dont worry about it
theyre perfectly safe
we can pick them up after school
my mom wont be home
its no problem
after school we double time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the to detroit rock city
the bell rings
as they say in the tampon biz see you next period
they shut their lockers in unison
the study hall teacher grades papers
on the wall a picture of president carter hangs next to old glory
the words be quiet are written on the blackboard
students study read doodle sleep
jam is at his desk touching up the word mystery on his drumstick
next to him sits beth
quirky but cute she stares longingly at him wanting to say something but not having the guts
pleased with his work jam puts the drumsticks on the desk and opens a peter criss album cover notebook depicting countless doodles of the kiss logo the mystery logo and
renderings of peter criss
beth sighs and opens her own notebook
drawings of hearts fill the pages
in them is written beth jeremiah and i love jeremiah
then one of jams drumsticks rolls off the desk and onto the floor
beth quickly reaches down to grab it for him just as he bends to get it too
thud they bash heads
rubbing her head she smiles and hands him the drumstick
he stuffs his drumsticks in his socks pulling his pantlegs down
jam and beth stare at each other
theres a mutual crush but both are apprehensive about making the first move
both want to speak neither does
they awkwardly go back to their notebooks
mustering the nerve jam breaks the ice and whispers
beth spins too quickly
her pen flies out of her hand
the pen hits jam in the eye
feeling awful beth moves in to help
the teacher looks up sternly
bruce miss bumsteen is there a problem
jam points to his eye
just a little pink eye
no reason to panic
unamused the teacher goes back to grading
handing back pen its okay
beth resumes doodling feeling like an idiot
jam does too
ah teenage awkwardness
finally beth musters up some courage
she hems and haw then
i wanted to tell you something
suddenly beth is rudely interrupted by high pitched feedback coming from the p
the principals voice echoes over it
jeremiah bruce come to the office immediately
jam throws a startled glance to the speaker as the class sings in unison
oooo youre in troubaaaallll
your mothers here and would like to see you right away
more feedback as the mike on the other end changes hands
give me that microphone
jeremiah you get your sorry self down to this office mister
all the kids except for beth burst into hysterical laughter
bruces tirade continues over quick shots of
hawk sits at his lab table burning an eraser with his bunsen burner
his eyes widen with horror behind his goggles as the other students laugh till they hurt
i found some things in the pockets of your jacket while i was picking up your disgusting laundry today
lexs eyes bug with terror
the basketball game is at a standstill as everyone is crippled with laughter
trip dozes at his desk as an out of date film about vd sputters on
the room is deafening with laughter
then as if hit by a ton of bricks trip wakes up alarmed by the familiar shrilly voice
and something much much worse
holy shit my jacket
we see jam hawk lex and trip agog in dread
if you know whats good for you youll get down here
jam slowly sinks in his chair under the profoundly humiliating weight of an entire schools echoed laughter
bruce sits next to a stand up ashtray in the high schools waiting area
scowling she fans the kiss tickets out with one hand
jam sits across from her one leg jittering anxiously
they sit for an uncomfortably long time until
bruce pulls a cigarette and lighter out of her purse
i made an appointment with father phillip mcnulty at st
were to see him directly where he will register you on the spot
you mean youre sending me to
b b boarding school
what else can i do
oh records and magazines and comic books are one thing but tickets
jeremiah do you realize what this means
that youre no longer content merely hearing their awful songs or looking at photos of their horrific faces
now you want to see the devil in the flesh
you want to reach out and touch pure evil
and in detroit no less
she flicks the lighter not yet lighting the cigarette
mom three of those tickets dont even belong to me
theyre for the guys
bruce holds the tickets over the lighters flame
and if the guys have parents who truly love them they will elevate me to sainthood for getting rid of these blasted things
bruce lights her smoke with the flaming tickets then drops them in the ashtray where they burn for a cruel eternity
jam stares semi catatonic through his moms sour expression
its been a long time coming son but youre finally going to get the kind of discipline you deserve
she stands and pulls him out the front entrance by his arm
hawk trip and lex peek around it their heads forming a totem pole
one by one they pull back
they slump against the wall devastated
i knew it
i knew this was gonna happen
i had a bad feeling since last night
we are so totally fucked
i got it
maybe we can glue the tickets back together
what are you high
for once lex is right
things cant get any worse from here
suddenly a caustic voice blurts from down the hall
i hope you rodents have hall passes
the boys whip their heads around to see a potbellied yellow toothed security officer with long sideburns and slicked back hair at the far end of the hall fists on
could that be three detentions i smell
elvis laughs and breaks into a run barreling down on them like a maniac
keys jangling furiously
second floor girls john
hell never look there
they take off in three different directions
still laughing elvis stops where the boys just were
which one to follow
he bolts after hawk who has taken the nearest staircase
beth looks sadly out the window watching mrs
bruce push jam in the car
beth puts her hand on the pane wanting to touch him
meanwhile elvis huffs and puffs up a flight of stairs arriving at a set of swinging doors
he goes to push one in but it swings out at him with a vengeance knocking him backward
from behind it pops hawk wielding a fire extinguisher
a hail of foam covers elviss face
hawk shoves the extinguisher into the mans arms and pushes elvis backwards down the stairs
he topples ass over head till he hits the landing
youre way out of your league elvis
elvis rises and shakes the co off like a wet dog
looking up he sees the door gently swinging in and out
no sign of hawk
trip kicks a bathroom stall violently
lex sits on the toilet in the stall
hey take it easy man
this is the girls crapper remember
wake up lex
we just watched jams mom torch our fuckin kiss tickets
not reo speedwagon
not the bay city rollers
if you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom id sure like to hear it
trip its not the end of the world okay
quit acting all squeezed out
trip grabs lex by the collar yanks him off the toilet and shoves him against the wall
oh everythings hunky dory now that the shit hit the fan just like you said it would you snug sonofabitch
you fuckin jinxed us
not snug smug
hawk bursts into the bathroom
were clear dudes
they run to exit
suddenly hawk backs up again into trip and lex as if a swarm of killer bees was out there
a skirt just came around the corner
hawk trip and lex run back and pile into the last stall
all three stand on the toilet bracing their arms against the walls for balance
a foxy girl hurries into the stall next to theirs
we see the top halves of three heads peek over the stalls partition
the three boys dont make a sound as they watch her sit down
as she glances up they recoil fast
they whisper super quiet
thats sherry vanhafton
ive been in love with her since the second grade
then a sound of tinkling
they all throw their hands over their mouths to stifle the giggles
she lets out an echoed fart
the boys are awestruck
she just farted
i have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life
just then the sound of cracking porcelain as the toilet theyre standing on breaks into pieces with a smash
they topple over pulling the stall walls down with them exposing the foxy chick sitting on the can
water gushes everywhere as she screams bloody murder getting doused ruining her farrah do
they bolt out the door slipping and sliding across the torrent of toilet water
lex turns and shrugs to the traumatized girl
heh heh sorry
bruce uses a finished cigarette to light another
someday youll have a son just like you jeremiah
a boy who lies through his teeth buys demonic records and smokes the dope just like you
numbly if im anything like you ill deserve him
i said im sorry
if you truly are sorry son then you better pray like youve never prayed before
god willed me to find those tickets because he wanted to hear from you
he knows you need help and he wants you to ask him for it
bruces car turns off the road and drives through an imposing set of wrought iron gates
the sign reads st
bernards veil of tears
a school for catholic boys
jam looks at what lies ahead
his face becomes a mask of pure terror
we hear a thunder clap as jam puts his hands together and closes his eyes humbling himself
please god help
the car winds up the path leading to a dark gothic edifice over which tumultuous storm clouds continuously hover
thunder belches and bolts of lightning shoot at the blackened crucifixes along the structure
we hear a scary organ theme
except for the tinkering noises that are heard as the students work on their projects there is silence in electronics class
the teacher mr
johansen sips from a coffee cup and reads a newspaper his feet on the desk
the headline says mass suicide in jonestown
cyanide in the kool aid
above him is a long banner reading sorry absolutely no bathroom breaks
hawk trip and lex sit before a half built radio on a work bench sheer desperation etched on their faces
lex solders two copper wires together
hawk attaches a dial
trip absently plays with a squeeze pump attached to a long plastic tube
he blows air into his face repeatedly with it
re squeeze pump tube wonder if you could smoke shit out of this
maybe some tunagell chase those blues away
hawk turns the radio on and a high frequency whine pours from its speaker
he adjusts the volume then the tuner until a djs voice comes through crisp and clear
and this is simple simon on the rock of detroit w
home of the biggest kiss giveaway in the history of the universe
hawk trip and lex react like theyve just been hit by phasers on stun
god is intervening
i got four count em four front row tickets along with four backstage passes to the concert tonight at cobo hall and im giving them to the th caller who
can tell me the real names of each kiss band member
high frequency noises again then the radio loses reception
hawk exchanges an anxious glance with trip and lex
too bad were stuck in electronics or
never mind with the too bad shit
i got a crazy plan but only the craziest among us can pull it off
johansen still sits with his feet up reading
the next pages headline reads first test tube baby born
trip runs up to mr
js desk one hand behind his back the other on his crotch
his face is drawn in an expression of sheer agony
hawk and lex watch anxiously in the background
verudi get back to your bench
trip puts one leg over the other always keeping a hand behind his back
but i gotta take a piss like you would not believe mr
put a clothespin on it till the end of class verudi
you know my rule
but ever since my doctor put me on salt pills its been like niagara falls every half hour
suddenly a wet stain grows across the crotch of trips pants
dont insult my intelligence verudi
stops when he sees the stain starting to spread
jeezis im taking a leak in my pants
we now see trip is squeezing the pump from before
he holds it behind him feeding water into the tube running down the back of his pants
the stain travels fast hitting trips knee in a nanosecond
in a state of shock mr
slowly opens a long forgotten drawer on his desk finding a cobweb and dust covered pad of bathroom passes
he tears one off and dust flies everywhere
he holds the pass out to trip like it was a cross he was holding before an advancing vampire
hoarsely get the hell out of here verudi
you disgust me
hawk and lex observe that trip has been successful then do a three stooges style handshake whispering curly
the secretary sits at her desk in the reception area filing paperwork
she pauses when she hears running footsteps
trip charges past a big wet stain on his crotch
the secretary notices the pump and tube flopping from the back of his pants as trip turns a corner
trip runs up to a pay phone on the wall pumps every nickel he has into it puts the phone to his ear and dials
i need to be connected to the w
hello is this me
a cubby of an office
cluttered beyond belief
elvis leans back on his chair against the wall reading a plop magazine
a transistor radio plays w
he bolts at the sound of trips name causing his chair to slide out from under him
am i on the air
gene klein stanley eisen paul frehley and peter uh criscoula
yeah thats it
the secretary hears an ecstatic yeeehaaww and turns to see trip wheeling back around the corner leaping in the air as he runs yowling like a rodeo cowboy
he bounds past her
she watches him and shakes her head
to herself moron
still on the floor elvis grabs the little radio with rage flips it off and screams at it
why you little
over my dead body
the bell rings
students pour into the hall
hawk and lex exit the class just as trip comes zigzagging down the corridor dodging the hordes
all three converge as trip cant contain his enthusiasm
i did it
i did it
the three burnouts jump scream hoot and play air instruments like loons as if theyre the only ones in the hall
they cant stop
the rest of the student body are not amused hawk trip and lex hold their trays over the counter as the lunch ladies fill them with salisbury steak hard dinner
rolls and scoops of bluish pudding
ah public school nutrition
stoked this is the best thing that ever happened to me at school
not only are we on again for kiss in detroit but were actually sitting right at the fifty yard line
i dare you dudes to find a curlier scenario
double stoked stan lee couldnt think of a better one
the chinese have a proverb that which appears too good to be true usually is
theres gotta be a catch
i have a saying too lex
it goes catch my jizz in your mouth and stop jinxing us asshole
were going this time and thats all there is to it
im afraid our constipated little friend is right this time trip
there is a catch
hawks really got their attention now
our band mystery is a quartet and we cant go on the road without our drummer
jams mom said something about sending him to st
we gotta bust him out before we go anywhere
bernards is way the hell over in the next county
your moms car has a cb radar detector and cruise control check
we are not stealing my moms car
damn straight we are
hawk all i need is one ding on the volvo and presto
there are my balls hanging from the rearview mirror after she gets back from cincinnati
and when is she due back from that groinecologists convention anyway
then lighten up
shell never know we touched it
alright heres the plan
we bus it to chez lex grab the volvo bail jam the hell outta st
bernards and arrive at the train station precisely on time for the to detroit
simple icity is more like it
and you guys thought jam was in trouble before
wait till mrs
bruce finds out he went to that concert with us
theres only so much trouble an individual can get into till it just doesnt matter anymore lex
you familiar with a condition known as absolute zero
the hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity
yeah im vaguely familiar well jam is in absolute trouble
he couldnt get any deeper into shit if he was a fly sitting in a horses ass
you know as well as me hed give his right arm just to see peter crisss drum solo never mind a whole kiss concert check
well the least we his only buds in the world can do is take him along with us tonight and give him one last curl before he starts serving his
just for the record i understood the last part of what you said but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever
i was just explaining to lex here what you and i already know
just had to make it a little more complicated so hed understand
very funny hawk
okay im in on this hare brained scheme but if anything happens to my moms car im blaming you
ill say you drugged me or something
hawk scopes out the cafeteria to make sure the coast is clear
ok dudes follow my lead
wait a minute
we ditching the rest of school
about fuckin time if you ask me
im just going through the motions till i drop out anyway
hello summer detention
as i was saying follow my lead
elvis just showed up
hawk points across the cafeteria and sure enough elvis has just entered
luckily he hasnt noticed the boys yet
elvis swaggers to a table of cheerleaders puts his leg on a chair and starts a one sided conversation with them
they promptly push their trays away having lost their appetites
meanwhile back at the condiment tray hawk and trip each grab a big handful of ketchup packets and head to a table
lex reluctantly follows suit grabbing a big handful of ketchup packets too
all three of them put their trays down and sit
eyeing elvis five second rule boys
see you on the other side
hawk approaches the exit door glances either way then leaves
trip and lex look at their watches for five seconds
then trip heads for the exit door also
lex still stares at his watch
after five he looks at elvis who stops talking to the cheerleaders
as if possessing some sixth sense elvis turns quickly and looks straight into elviss pov he spots the swinging exit door and an empty table with three full lunch trays
sitting on it
excuse me ladies
relieved hes gone the cheerleaders start eating again
elvis moves through the cafeteria in slow motion toward the exit door
the hunter in action
elvis pushes through the door and into a hall dead eye stare focused up ahead where the hallway turns sharply
he catches a glimpse of lex
smiling like the devil elvis bolts
lex catches up with hawk and trip just as elvis swings around the corner and marauds after them cackling maniacally
a mad chase ensues
hawk trip and lex scramble as fast as they can to escape the clutches of their sideburn clad nemesis
as the boys pass a classroom a nerd comes out pushing a projector on an av cart
thinking fast hawk grabs it out of the nerds hands and pushes it down the hall at elvis
hey im responsible for that
elvis bashes face first into the rolling cart
he and the projector go tumbling
not wasting a second elvis is back on his feet and after them again
the nerd grabs his hair in horror at the sight of the smashed projector
elvis skids around the corner and trips on a fire hose stretched across the floor from its glass box to a water fountain pipe
he slides on his belly along the polished floor unable to stop
old miss hibbs is lecturing on moby dick
the kids are dozing
then a cry from the crows nest
thar she blows
suddenly a screaming elvis slides into the open door on his stomach and bowls miss hibbs over like a brunswick
he clamors to his feet and shoots out the room leaving everyone stunned
pausing at the corner elvis takes a breath and leaps around it
he smiles at what he sees
up ahead hawk lex and trip stand on a stair stoop desperately pulling at a locked door
they kiss concert
kiss my ass morelike
a nice fat detention oughta put a crimp in this evenings plans
elvis takes his key ring off his belt and begins twirling it
the boys turn and face him
he savors the moment
looking for something rodents
hawks brow furrows as he pulls about fifty ketchup packets out of his pocket
trip and lex do the same
your ass on a lunch tray
elvis laughs and lurches forward the boys cue to drop the ketchup packets at their feet and
on your marks and
trip and lex ready themselves then
they start stomping on the packets squirting elviss face and torso with tomato based condiment causing him to let out a scream that lasts the rest of the scene
ketchup spatters across his body in super slow motion
a shot hits him in the mouth and he coughs it back out in mid scream
the boys stomp relentlessly mercilessly blasting their nemesis with hideous cafeteria red as elvis throws his arms back body quaking at every splat
its kind of like the scene in the godfather where sonny gets it
beaten and spent his scream now dried up to a hoarse gasping elvis slips on some ketchup at his feet
he hits the floor with a thud right in the goop
he lays there letting out dry sobs looking like a bunless wiener
hawk jumps off the stoop
taking elviss key chain away he hops back up and unlocks the door letting trip and lex out
hawk whips the keys back at elvis hitting him in the head then flashes a pearly error flynn smile
elvis you aint nothin but a hot dog
hawk bolts out the door
elvis tries to get up only to slip in the muck again and fall back down twice as hard
c u on the grill of a moving car ohio vanity plate reading ob gyn
pull back to reveal its on a brand spanking new brown volvo dl hauling ass
hawk drives lex rides shotgun and trip sits in the back arms draped over the front seat
the volvo turns and barrels up st
bernards gated entrance
well here we are back at fucking school again
figures its named after a canine
hawk and trip roll their eyes
bruce and father mcnulty stand outside his office
the door is open a tad
jam sits just beyond it but all we see are his corduroyed legs which shake
jam is one nervous kid
again many thanks and praise to you for seeing jeremiah on such short notice
father mcnulty has a look of utter compassion on his face
anything for a potential tuition
to be given to charity of course
god bless you father mcnulty
he already has
and the look of utter compassion on father mcnultys face disappears
the priest enters slams the door shut startling jam and sits in front of a painting of the virgin mary on his wall
the name plate on his desk reads fr
before enrolling you jeremiah let me just say it would be greatly appreciated if your career at st
bernards was an uneventful one
some students believe they can get expelled through disobedience and recklessness
what they dont understand is even after gods vengeance is meted out he forgives
that his devastating anger is followed by his nurturing compassion
in a nutshell st
bernards may punish you even for the slightest digression but will never cast you out even for the largest
so here you are jeremiah
here to stay
father mcnulty sticks the pencil into an electric pencil sharpener and it makes the same noise a dentists drill does when burrowing into a molar
the father removes the pencil and blows the shavings away from the needle sharp tip
lets begin the enrollment shall we
bruce exits the building and approaches her car
she stops when she sees the brown volvo parked behind her
she shrugs and gets into her car driving off
inside the volvo hawk trip and lex poke their heads up
the coast is clear so they can sit straight again
they stare up at a second story window where they see part of jams profile
now how are we gonna do this
gimme a second dudes
they hear an engine and turn to see a delivery truck labelled pizza pig parking behind them
a delivery boy holding a pizza box steps out
trips mouth waters
licking his chops mmm pizza
seeing the boys the delivery boy stops at the volvo
hey you guys know where
looks at slip on box philip mcnutlys office is
hawk trip and lex exchange an anxious glance then hawk smiles
he is officially inspired as he turns to the boy
yeah im philip mcnutly
the father taps his pencil looking impatiently at jam who has totally withdrawn
he sits motionless staring into space
jeremiah are you aware you need to answer these questions not just listen to them
jam doesnt respond
please dont become difficult this early in your stay
i hate disciplining boys before i get to know them
a nun enters knocking
forgive me father
a young man here with a pizza for you
send him in sister conimaria
the nun exits and a second later hawk enters wearing lexs baseball cap pulled down over his eyes
well whats the damage pizza fellow
the priest swivels his chair around and unlocks a box labelled donations
while he looks for cash hawk gives jam a discreet kick in the shin
jam looks up and recognizes hawk
he then looks out the window seeing trip lex and the volvo below
for the first time we see what jam looks like with a big fat shit eating grin on his face
whispering to jam if he offers you a slice youre not the least bit hungry check
father mcnulty swivels back around with a ten
heres ten and im donating your tip to the church
the lord thanks you
tell the big guy not to mention it
hawk takes the ten tips the brim of the baseball cap and leaves giving jam a cautious wink as he goes
and not a moment too soon
i hope you brought a lunch for yourself
no but im not hungry anyway
father mcnulty raises his eyebrows then opens the pizza box
it finally speaks
theres one barrier weve broken through
father mcnulty smiles taking a big bite
jam smiles for an entirely different reason
the priest mumbles with a mouthful
you know your coming here reminds me of a gospel called the prodigal son
jam grins a bit feigning interest
there was once a farmer who had two sons
both grew up on the farm helping their father until
suddenly alarmed father mcnulty gags sticking his pizza covered tongue out
he pours himself a glass of wine and sucks it down looking concerned for the moment
finally he belches
that was a very stale mushroom
beat where was i
ah yes one day the elder son decided to leave the farm
hawk trip and lex look up at father mcnultys window
usually takes anywhere from ten minutes to half an hour
they look at their watches then back at the window
this is such a lousy view
how the hell are we gonna know when hes lit
just then insane laughter bellows from the window above
the father has undergone a metamorphosis
hes redder than a boiling lobster his eyes bulge and hes laughing the deepest laugh a man can without risking psychological evaluation
jam watches fascinated as the priest tries to finish the story
its not every day you see a holy man tripping on shrooms
in mid guffaw so then the younger one says but dad
ive been helping you on the farm my entire life
belly laugh you never once slaughtered the fatted calf for me
more belly laughter forgive me jeremiah its just that
ive been telling this gospel for years and
i just now realized its the work of some comedy mastermind
the prodigal son is a barrel of fucking monkeys
father mcnulty belly laughs so hard this time he slides off his chair hitting his chin on the edge of his desk
he is in pain only momentarily then laughs again this time at his own pratfall
he hoists himself back into his chair
hawk trip and lex suddenly barge into the office followed by the outraged nun
you kids cant go in there
its okay were old buds of father mcnulty
hows it hangin padre
a little to the right pizza fellow
father mcnulty laughs some more
that was another dude
anyway were here to take our bud jam to the big satanic kiss concert tonight
okay with you
waving rock on
jam gets up and all four boys exit
yelling after them give my regards to the guy with the really big tongue
the nun looks at the priest deep concern in her eyes
what the hell are you doing sister gonorrhea waiting for a bus
he lets out a belly laugh as the shocked nun runs from the office
father mcnulty laughs even louder at her behavior pounding his fists on the desk tears rolling down his cheeks until
he suddenly glimpses at the painting of the virgin mary and abruptly stops laughing
what appears to be extreme contrition washes over his face as he moves closer to the painting
christ look at all the colors
hawk drives trip rides shotgun lex and jam sit in the back
stoked beyond belief jam pounds his drumsticks on the upholstery to the beat of a rockin kiss tune playing on the track
oh man my mom is gonna send me to alcatraz for this and i dont even care
im gonna see peter crisss drum solo
lex taps jam on the shoulder
not looking like that mr
lex hands him a paper bag with jeans and a tee shirt in it
we got you a change of duds when we picked up the car
next stop the to detroit rock city
the boys do their three stooges handshake and say curly
jam starts to change
just then the volvo passes a two tone chevy impala with luggage tied to the roof
the passenger in the back seat turns and spots jam pulling off his pants
her eyes bulge
beth parents are in the front
jam spots her and beams
their eyes lock
she waves and starts to yell something when
the boys look out the drivers side of the car to see the rear hubcap rolling away
theyve got a flat
screams my moms hubcap
the car fishtails and weaves but hawk manages to pull over
the chevy continues on beth gazing out the rear window sadly
looks at car clock anybody know how long it takes to fix a flat
angle on a status report
the is now leaving
we see is hawk trip lex and jam running alongside a train as it picks up speed by the second
they yell for it to stop but its hopeless
the train is gone
so much for the
lex looks at the speedometer
hawks got it up to ninety five
jeezis hawk can you at least keep it within twenty miles of the speed limit
lex am i gonna have to lock you in the trunk till we reach detroit
dont worry these babies are built for speed
trip holds his stomach as we hear it growl
im starvin and its way past lunchtime
all ive had for chow was a packet of pop rocks and a yoo hoo
trip spots a sign on the side of the road next exit sandusky
lets stop in sandusky hawk
whats in sandusky
pizza and i been jones in for a pizza ever since we left st
the boys chomp on their pizza slices and chug cans of hawaiian punch
another raucous kiss tune blares
behind them a car horn starts honking rhythmically
hawk looks into the rearview mirror and sees two guys and two girls in a tailgating trans am
the guys have m
haircuts tacky wide collared shirts and massive amounts of jewelry on their necks
the girls wear layer make up mega jewelry and hair teased so high it touches the cars roof
only a car full of guidos and stellas would ride someones ass on a two lane road and beep
the speakers blast a disco song to which the four passengers sing
kenny the driver honks to the disco beat
theyre slightly older than our heroes and very full of themselves
kenny and his best girl christine sit in the front
bobby and barbara are in the back
its a double disco date
trip lifts a rubbery slice of pizza to his mouth and the top layer slides off plopping into his lap
this is one hot pizza
trip huck that out before it stains the upholstery
trip grabs the wad of goop and throws it out the window
just as the disco tune playing in the trans am hits the next chorus a fistful of pizza splatters across the windshield
freaked kenny swerves and zigzags all over the road
righting himself kennys entire family might as well have been insulted
he turns off the stereo and floors the accelerator swerving into the left lane and passing the volvo
bobby is just now noticing the mess on the windshield
he starts to laugh
hey kenny look
theres a hunk of fawkin cheese on your windsheel
lex is looking at the mess on the trans ams windshield and the anger in the eyes of its passengers
we just pissed off the incredible hulk his idiot half brother and two circus clowns
the trans am runs alongside the volvo and hawk turns to see kenny pointing to the breakdown lane
stop the friggin car now
hawk rolls up his window
kenny yells voice muffled and points to hawk who pays absolutely no attention whatsoever
dont you think we should at least pull over and offer to clean it off
are you mentally deranged jam
just then slam the trans am bangs up against the side of the volvo pushing it onto the shoulder
what the fuck
freaking out the paint
the trans am muscles the volvo into the breakdown lane
parking the ass end of the pontiac out a bit kenny blocks the volvo in
kenny and bobby climb from their car and storm over to the boys
hawk opens his door just as kennys hairy knuckled hands pull him out through the window
he grabs trip yanking him out too
bobby opens the back door and does the same with lex and jam
with a kid in each hand now kenny and bobby slam the four boys against the volvo in a line
the size difference between the burnouts and the guidos is painfully obvious now
kenny and bobby are neanderthals
do you realize the sheer goddamn unadulterated undiluted no holds barred one hundred percent pure as ivory snow absolutely friggin stupidity of what you just did
hey disco dude its cool
kenny hauls back and slaps the row of boys in the faces three stooges style
trip lex and jam clutch their faces in pain
hawk looks merely disenchanted as kenny pokes a muscle bound finger at his chest
getting in hawks face kenny yammers loud and fast
lemme paint you a friggin picture ahright
imagine if you will a pontiac trans american in pristine condition
beat an appealing portrait nesspah
hawk starts to say yes
whats that spec on the windshield
could it be a wad of melted mozzarella tangy tomato sauce and various friggin meat products
hawk is unimpressed
and if it aint cleaned off
kenny come on with the macho crap already
like this kid could take you in a fight anyway
ignoring christine answer me hippie girl
and if the mess aint cleaned off my car
kenny looks at bobby and they exchange moronic grins
youre a smart little homo arent you hippie girl
but while astounded at your nimble friggin insight i still detect an issue hanging fire namely where does a sharp witted faggot like yourself get off doing such a dopey
thing like that there
hawk figured out that any answer he gives will be incorrect and has decided to wait till kennys done
no really im perplexed
i mean could you have done stupider if you were born without a fuckin head
using oh to mean enough oh
with the language
shut up christine
christine snarls at kenny
i dont mean to drain your keg or anything but could you speed up this process
beat dont get me wrong wed love to stand here and get shit on by the cast of saturday night fever but were also on a schedule
so step on it
cold silence as kenny replays hawks insult over in his head
are you gettin wise with me
no im dumber than a goddamn slug
now can i please clean your windshield and leave without further ado
break his fawkin legs kenny
kennys tempers rising faster than the price of gasoline
hawk on the other hand is cooler than an otter pop
oh youre dumb all right you hairy ass punk
but please allow me to clean the friggin windshield
and with that kenny grabs himself a fistful of hawks long hair and pulls him over to the trans am
he wipes the pizza off with hawks hair tugging hawks head up and down back and forth
hawk grunts with each wipe but doesnt give kenny the satisfaction of hearing him scream
trip lex and jam watch helplessly trapped under bobbys dull witted but equally threatening gaze
kenny gets the last of the big chunks off his windshield and looks at his handiwork
nice and clean
he throws hawk to the ground and smiles at bobby
then he suddenly hears the kiss tune coming from the volvo
oh no no no
its the fag band
kenny clenches his jaws and walks up to the volvo reaching in the drivers door
suddenly jam grabs his wrist
this is about pizza
lets leave kiss out of it
a bunch of guys who make bad music dress like freaks and wear more make up than all my sisters combined
these assholes must be stopped
kenny pushes jam away
thats it kenny
christine gets out of the car and starts walking down the highway exiting the scene
you googatz in the head or something
were on the side of the freakin highway
let her go barbara shell come back to kenny
she always does
to kenny right kenny
kenny meanwhile has his arm in the volvo
kool and the gang now theres real music
kenny takes the track from the car
he flings it into the highway where it is summarily smashed to bits under the wheels of a passing semi
follow a chunk of cartridge and a strand of mangled tape streaming from it as it sails back toward the side of the road landing at jams feet
tilt up to jams face
he raises his eyes and turns to the camera a single tear rolling down his cheek just like the indian in that keep america beautiful litter ad
hawk rises and kenny comes face to face with him
all that having been said and done i believe we are ready for the final topic of discussion
namely have you learned your lesson yet puke
hawk pulls a cigarette from his pocket and lights it
he blows some smoke in kennys face
well lets recap shall we
you slapped all of us yelled at me used my head for a rag threw me on the ground and tossed our love gun track under the wheels of a
puffing on cig so if the lesson was that youre a dick with ears and a really bad haircut then yes
id say we learned it
beat in disbelief excuse me im a little deef a hearin
can you repeat yourself
out of original material kenny goes for an old stand by
thats not what your mother said last night
trip lex and jam exchange uh oh glances
meanwhile hawks eyes glaze over
its not huh
well then tell me
hawk reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out his mostly empty can of hawaiian punch holding it discreetly at his side
what exactly did my mother say last night
kenny draws a blank not being prepared for this one
you heard me prick
what did my mother say last night
kenny chuckles and looks at bobby
they have a good little laugh
the homos got balls
then kenny turns back to hawk
ill tell you what your mother said last night
beat she said that i was the fuck of her life
hawk is a little mad now
he tosses his cigarette to the ground and squashes it like a bug under his sneaker
very clint eastwood how would you like a nice hawaiian punch
quick as a shot hawk slams the bottom of the can into kennys nose crushing it flat against his face
hawaiian backwash spews from its tab hole like blood as kenny falls backwards from the impact
he hits his head on the ground
taking this as a cue
trip whips out his wallet on a chain
lex rips off his kiss belt
and jam yanks out his drumsticks
as if choreographed trip swoops the wallet at bobbys feet snagging him around the ankles tightly with the chain
lex thwams bobby in the face with his big kiss belt buckle leaving a reversed red kiss logo branded in his forehead
trip yanks the chain pulling bobby off his feet
when he hits the ground jams right there drumming his balls
meanwhile hawk advances on kenny who tries to get the can off his face but its stuck on looking like a pigs nose with fruit punch for snot
hawk raises both his hands in kennys face then executes the final insult
hawk messes kennys hair
kenny lets out a scream that comes from the bottom of his vanity
hawk grabs kenny by the ears and brings the guidos head swiftly against his kneecap
kenny falls to the ground unconscious on top of bobby
their heads collide knocking bobby out cold
terrified barbara leaps from the trans am and is cornered
not so fast stella
kenny bobby and barbara are now tied to the guardrail with jams white corduroy pants geeky belt and plaid shirt
kenny and bobby rest their unconscious heads on each of barbaras shoulders
hawk trip lex and jam look down at the two guidos and the stella snickering
when they wake up theyre gonna come looking for you jerks
you best hope they dont find you cause if they do theyre gonna kick your asses
hawk grabs a cinderblock off the side of the road walking up to the trans am
right stella and well deserve it
but lets really make it worth their while
hawk puts the rock on the trans ams accelerator letting the engine whine in protest
again we are cautious not to show the guidos faces
by the way when kenny wakes up could you give him a message for me
tell him quote kool and the gang bite my bag motherfucker unquote
he throws the trans am into drive
all who are conscience listen to the brief screech then watch the trans am as it barrels without a driver into the woods skirting the highway
it races into ditches bounces off trees and splashes through ponds all smokey and the bandit like
the disco mobile ramps off the edge of an embankment tumbles down a steep rocky incline breaking apart along the way and finally boom
it explodes on final impact
the boys all look at each other and shrug
hawk walks back to the volvo and gets in
trip lex and jam follow suit and pile in as well
lex shouts back to barbara
oh thanks for letting us draw from your ample make up supply
you must have the entire revlon factory in your purse
we now see them from the front
lo and behold kenny has been made up like gene simmons bobby like paul stanley
whoever finds them is gonna get the wrong idea about their musical taste
and kick their asses all over again
i hope you choke
hawk starts the engine and takes off
trip pulls a baggie of weed and some rolling papers out
hey look its that girl
jam points out at the road ahead to christine
shes a few hundred feet away walking sadly in the breakdown lane
thats no girl
thats a stella
stella or no stella we should pull over and help her out
oh no jam
im not falling for that twice
well couldnt you slow down so i can at least state my case hawk
if you dont like it you can speed up and ill never mention it again
hawk slows down turning into the breakdown lane travelling about two miles per hour
christine doesnt notice as they edge closer to her
what is it with you jam
you got a thing for that
shes a teenage girl walking on the side of the highway
they make very scary movies that start out like that
well they may not make movies about four dudes going to a kiss concert
but if they ever did the four dudes most certainly would not stop and pick up a stranded disco bunny
unless there was gonna be a scene where the disco bunny blows the four dudes on the way to the show
christine sits between jam and lex in the back snapping gum
jam and lex stare at her like cats looking at a fish bowl
hawk looks in the rearview mirror at christine checking herself in a compact
she swathes on some up flavored bonnie bell lip gloss
trip meanwhile twirls the joint hes just finished rolling in his mouth sealing it
he winks at her disgustingly
i just hitched a ride with a bunch of potheads
im hooking up with some people at this funky place in downtown detroit called disco inferno
mind droppin me there
smirks whats it worth to you
grossed out what the hell is that supposed to mean
it doesnt mean anything
dont pay attention to him
rolls his eyes disco inferno
discos infernal morelike
trying to be suave lex moves in close putting the make on her
your clothes may say disco but your eyes say rock n roll baby
well your tee shirt may say rock n roll but your breath says pepperoni baby
she pushes him away
frustrated so are you like gonna polish our nobs or what
thoroughly offended what
thats so fuckin rude man
oh quit bein the wussy sensitive guy to impress her jam
shes obviously not gonna put out
shes a fuckin tease
what the hell did i do to tease you mongoloids
you got in the car didnt you
oh god how calculating of me to lead you all on like that after you offered me a ride in the middle of nowhere
trip lights the joint and takes a lungful of pot
he passes it to lex and the joint begins to make its rounds with the exception of christine
the car starts to fill with smoke
the names christine not stella
and theres no need to be such pigs just cause i prefer donna summer or kc and the sunshine boys or the village people over kiss
with disdain the village people
youre a fag hag
come on hawk
i can take care of myself but thanks anyway germ
to hawk okay joe burnout lets get one thing straight here
as far as im concerned good tunes is good tunes be it disco or rock or polka or whatever have you regardless of the category
true if i had to choose id pick the category labelled disco because i happen to enjoy dancing
disco is just easier to dance to
you call that john travolta denny terio shit dancing
i wouldnt dance like that in private if you paid me
disco blows dogs for quarters
christine processes this remark
now theres an intelligently biting remark wrought with wit and irony
trip looks confused then smiles thinking she paid him a compliment
hey if you dont like that one maybe youll think its funny when we throw your ass out the goddamn car
yeah why dont you put your money where your mouth is
why dont you kiss my hairy crack
why dont you bend over youre looking right at it
all christine included pause to think about what that comment was supposed to mean
lex takes a hit off the joint
holding in smoke that last remark fell about yards away from making any sense whatsoever
hawk and trip immediately bust into the giggles and it doesnt take long for lex and jam to follow suit
realization hey youre right
bend over youre looking right at it
starts to laugh whats that supposed to mean anyway
christine succumbs to the contagious giggle epidemic and the whole car gets a great laugh for a while
they finally calm down again and wipe tears from their eyes
lex still has the joint now as christine looks at it
man this is some kickass shit
beat gimme a hit off that jay will ya
lex smiles despite himself and holds the weed out to her as we
the volvo passing a big sign that says welcome to michigan the great lakes state
the volvo racing toward the detroit skyline
detroit landmarks the general motors building the ford building motown records and finally
cobo hall where thousands of fans in kiss tees gather waiting for its doors to open
unbelievable traffic stretches to an intersection at which stand four key landmarks
a cathedral a convenience store a parking lot and a male strip joint
they face one another each on its own corner
a gigantic sign on the auditoriums facade flashes the commandment you gotta lose your mind in detroit rock city over and over again
the sun hangs low on this day as the volvo sits in traffic passing cobo hall
movement is nearly impossible
kiss fans cram every square foot of open macadam pushing through the jammed cars
street vendors hawk kiss souvenirs from tee shirts to pennants
some are in stands along the sidewalk
others come right up to car windows
christine is fast asleep between jam and lex
man that weed knocked christine on her ass
shes sleeping like a baby stella
whispers lustfully lets lift up her shirt
pointing out windshield there it is
all look ahead
a halo glow forms around the building accompanied by a choir of angels
in reverence we made it
curly driving hawk
we still got two hours to spare
ample time to grab our tickets at the station
see up ahead
one block on the left is the w
hey look at the front entrance
a cars pulling out
the parking space from heaven
god is surely smiling down upon us tonight dudes
kind of funny i thought hed be pissed as hell at me
the opening to the carpenters top of the world begins
top of the world continues playing through the speaker of the ascending elevator inside which hawk trip lex and jam stand
they watch the numbers climb smiling
what was that d
s name again
oh ill remember it till the day i die
his name was
simpleton the simian
no samson samoan
no simply similar
hawk trip lex and jam poke their heads around the corner of an office doorway totem pole style
simple simon strikes a pose before a full length mirror in a glittery back gene simmons tee shirt silver pants and very high heel boots
he has a huge afro and bushy moustache
he turns when he hears hawk
the one and only
but can you kids hurry this up
im due at coco hall in half an hour for the warm up
they all enter and stand at simple simons desk
were right behind you simo
just wanted to thank you in advance for handing over those burly ass tix me and my buds won this morning
the boys do a three stooges handshake and say curly
simple simon on the other hand suddenly appears nonplussed your name isnt trip is it
hawk trip lex and jam sit in the tiny producers booth with simon who fast forwards a reel to reel tape through some very loud high speed conversation and bits
looking at the footage counter on the tape player he slows down at a certain point and lets the boys listen to this the click of a phone being answered
simple simon on the rock go caller
is this me
am i on the air
i should hang up on you right now but youre the right caller so answer quick or get your battleship sunk
what are the names of the four members of kiss

stay on the line so we can get your full name information and
oh man you didnt hang up on me did you

simple simon stops the tape and looks at the boys who look like theyve just been served a life sentence behind bars
well there you have it
we had no choice but to give the tickets to the next caller
hawk trip lex and jam stare at the floor in silence
we got sodas in the fridge if that helps any
hawk trip lex and jam ride back down the elevator sipping nehi sodas watching the floor numbers get lower and lower
terry jacks immortal hit seasons in the sun plays over the elevator speaker
well here we are dudes
one hour and thirty minutes away from the concert of the century
all thanks to wile e
coyote super fucking genius over here
trip looks away from the rest ashamed
really trip can we bore holes in your head and use it as a bong so it actually does us some good for a change
fuck you lex
this whole thing wouldnt have happened if it wasnt for you jinxing us
i just made an honest mistake
oh im sorry trip
what you made was a big brainless pile of horse shit
come on if this is anyones fault its mine
i was the one who grabbed trips jacket by mistake
its my fault and i apologize
please jam were trying to vent some hostility here
sure the whole thing may be your fault but whos gonna get pissed off at you
jam looks at his feet
sometimes i think i dont deserve friends as good as you guys
hawk trip and lex cringe
i have one question
how could a kid who wails on the drums like its the only thing keeping him alive even think of such a femmy thing to say
really jam you tryin to make us barf
yeah its like youre possessed by the flying nun or something
the doors to the elevator open and the boys step out
cobo hall looms up ahead
hawk trip lex and jam enter the sidewalk
a thickening crowd of kiss fans continually meander by
on their way to the car they suddenly hear a womans voice bellowing through a megaphone from somewhere down the street
after a moment they see the voices source
a group of women has congregated about forty feet ahead and their leader her back toward the boys yells to the group through her bullhorn
flying above them all is a large banner reading matmok mothers against the music of kiss
welcome to the first open meeting of matmok mothers against the music of the group cheers as the kiss fans milling around them pretty much ignore the whole matmok spectacle
lex looks away from the matmoks and into the street
we cant see what he sees but we can tell hes alarmed
ignoring lex now theres a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood
they all look at lex
eyes focused ahead wheres the volvo
hawk trip and jam look at their parking spot to see a beat up dodge dart sitting there instead of the volvo
i can see that bright boy
what happened to it
it was stolen
incredulous christine stole it
asleep my ass
the stella booted with your moms wheels
but we took the keys
damn she musta hot wired it
we picked up a professional car thief in the shape of olivia newton john
okay im just a little mad now
jam whyd you talk us into picking that bitch up in the first place
im sorry guys
i thought it was a nice thing to do
jam not another word out of your femmy ass mouth
okay were here we got nothing and we got an hour and a half
were totally committed
its time to brainstorm
heres a suggestion
lets stop worrying about the concert for the time being and get the cops in on this volvo situation
wake up lex
this is detroit
the cops arent gonna waste city dollars looking for a swedish car
face it the volvos on a cutting board as we speak getting sliced diced and julienned by christine the chop shop gourmet
lex is developing a look of resolve
this is detroit
now listen up
heres the game plan
on a roll i mean my moms got insurance
whats the worst thing she could do
ground me for the entire year
i can handle that
cool bro now listen up
i am in absolute trouble
i never should have let you drive man
absolute fuckin trouble
okay shut the fuck up lex
now then step number one we find us a scalper
takes out kiss money clip twenty five
twenty five moren i got
all i got is five
the rest is in the volvo
dont tell us jam
just show us
jam holds up a ten keeping his mouth shut
so maybe we got enough for one ticket
i got it
we find four really small kids beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets
what do you think
sarcastic brilliance trip
give albert einstein here the nobel prize
trip smiles proudly
i think we should try sneaking in
four dudes sneaking in
wed get busted fer sure
okay one of us sneaks in gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience comes back out and we all re enter the concerto
still too risky for my money
looking at watch were running out of time here
this is kiss
a victory for one is a victory for the team
im sure i can barter with a scalper but if you dudes think you got better plans go for it
well reconvene at that intersection
hawk points to the intersection where the church the male strip joint the parking lot and the smiley mart are located
at twenty thirty hours
one more time in english
for the next hour and a half its every dude for himself
try to get at least one ticket and at p
well meet over there
i know how we can get in
jam shut up
youre not allowed to speak remember
go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four
i dont wanna hear it
my plan involves all four of us acting together
see you at jam
to lex and trip dudes
hawk trip and lex split up leaving jam alone
he starts walking in the opposite direction passing matmoks
the leader is still on a roll yelling through the megaphone
look around you tonight mothers
look at all the young faces
they smile and laugh but their eyes have lost all hope
not one among them appears to possess the love and fear of god
this satanic group kiss has stolen their souls
the leaders gaze finally falls upon jam
he lets out a gasp
yes the leader is mrs
so this was her church meeting
she freezes when she sees her son her jaw slackens
meanwhile jam looks stunned beyond comprehension
bruce quickly hands the megaphone to another matmok member who picks up where mrs
bruce left off
jam looks around for someplace to run and hide but its too late
bruce slices through the crowd of kiss fans and grabs jam by the ear
i dont know how you got here tonight and i dont want to know either
all i know is youre going to pay dearly for this one young man
bruce tugs jam toward the intersection we saw before
they cross the street toward the corner where the cathedral sits
jam looks up at the cross on the steeple and gulps with trepidation
mom whatre we
just keep your lying heathenous trap shut jeremiah
they climb the steps to the cathedral passing a bulletin board reading thank god its friday mass pm pm
parishioners exit the beautiful church shaking hands with a priest as they leave
what a wonderful mass father so inspirational father thank you
thank you come again next week
bruce pulls jam up to the priest
next mass is tomorrow morning sister
can we talk father
my son was about to defy god by going to that blasphemous kiss concert
in that case come right in
meanwhile across the street
parked in front of the busy fast food establishment we recognize the two toned chevy impala with luggage tied on top
in the window we see beth and her parents sitting at one of the booths
out the window beth looks across the street just as jam mrs
bruce and the priest enter the cathedral
her face drops
oh my god
jeremiah bruce from school
he and his mom just went into that church
he must be in detroit for the concert
can i go say good bye to him
beth i am not letting you wander the streets of detroit after dark
im not going to wander
im just gonna go over there
beth points to st
hes with his mom
fine as long as we know where you are
but dont be long
we need to be getting back on the road
beth is already out the door and halfway across the street
dad pats moms shoulder
shes probably got a little crush on that boy
beth runs up to the cathedral and sneaks in
hawk walks down the sidewalk badgering everyone passing by for a ticket getting the same stock answer suffer dude
he stops and sits on a curb lighting a cigarette
behind him stands the marquee for its raining men the male strip joint
a disco song comes from inside
just when it looks like hawks given up a voice is heard above
need a ticket
hawk cant believe his ears
he looks up at a greasy looking hybrid part porn star part used car salesman the scalper
second row center seventy five clams
trying to act confident hawk takes out his money clip showing the scalper twenty five dollars
dude this is all i got
sorry man no can do
but ill be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy
where the hell am i gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour
the easy way
the scalper points over his shoulder and hawk turns to see three giggling women exiting the strip joint
none are under forty
a sign below the bars logo reads amateur night giveaway
guys over only
bare it all and win bucks
you look a little scrawny but its worth a shot
i cant just walk in and take my clothes off
guess you dont want to see the greatest show on earth
and in detroit no less
well take care chief
the scalper turns and hawk grabs his arm
dude if it were dancing the way fred astaire did it id give it my best shot
id learn the steps and practice in my spare time
tribal ritualistic bullshit its way too spontaneous for me
yeah youre probably too young anyhow
hey i invented fake i
thats not the problem
theyre playing disco music in there man
chief heres a little secret
drink heavily your feet will know what to do
now shit or get off the pot
do you wanna dance or do you wanna see kiss only on their album covers
hawk gets a look of resolve on his face
you sure youll have a ticket for me
you have my solemn oath as a public servant
hawk turns and walks up to the door hesitating before opening it
rummaging through his pockets he pulls out a handful of expired drivers licenses
choosing the one he thinks best suits himself he walks in with trepidation
the scalper sees someone else coming up
hey chief you need a ticket
second row center seventy five clams
no thanks dude
im beating my ticket out of some poor defenseless chump
trip exits frame
whats happening to kids today
hawk enters your average everyday male strip joint
a crowd of lusty women cheer on a stripper in a firemans suit
he dances on a lighted tile stage under a spinning mirror ball
hawk shows the man at the door his fake license and the man nods him in
he approaches the bar in the early stages of being very intimidated
the bartender a man dressed only in tight black tuxedo pants shirt cuffs and a tie comes up to hawk
voice cracking like to sign up for the contest
the bartender gives hawk the once over
youre a little scrawny but thanks to the concert were low on amateurs
pick a song hawk
got any kiss
this is detroit
yeah a mans drink
hawk squints at a name tag on the bartenders tie
dickey goes to the bottle rack on the other side of the bar
to himself im gonna need all the help i can get tonight
dickey returns with the drink and hawk pulls out his money clip
looking at the drink whats that
you mean you never seen a jack daniels on the rocks before
hawk looks at the unfamiliar drink again trying to play it cool
sure i have
but not one with ice in it thats all
seeing money clip save your money stud muffin
the lady at the end of the bar sends her love
dickey points to a woman sitting at the end of the bar
mature and sexy
shes a knock out
every teenage boys fantasy
hawks eyes pop at this mrs
robinson before him
she is a killer
her ex is one of the wealthiest businessmen in detroit
play your cards right and you could hit paydirt
she like em young
leaning in and since you look a little new at this let me give you three words of advice
hard to get
think it act it know it be it
nothing a woman loves more than when you beat her at her own head games
dicky pats hawks shoulder and leaves
hawk looks away from amanda and scans the room
he glances back at amanda
shes still gazing at him the way queens of yore must have eyed particularly cute knights
she winks and toasts hawk
hawk raises his glass smiling nervously
they both sip at their drinks
she licks her lips suggestively at him
and hawk proceeds to cough up his mouthful of jack daniels spraying it all over the bar
your typical s convenient store
out front two six year olds in star wars tee shirts play tug o war with a stretch armstrong doll
trip stomps over grabbing them by their mini shirts
when he tries to act tough its pathetic
even six year olds arent afraid
hey you little twerps gimme your kiss tickets or ill pop your fuckin faces in
we dont have any kiss tickets
yeah kiss sucks
i oughta kick your asses for sayin that
he grabs the stretch armstrong and stuffs it in his pocket
but im in a hurry so ill just take this instead
the kids run away
the store is crawling with kiss fans some reading the comic books others playing pinball against a far wall still others looking at the poster section
trip enters on a mission
he looks around catching the eye of a pretty cashier
shes a rocker wearing a who tee shirt a mood ring and just a little too much make up
she smiles at him
trip returns the smile with a feeble wave
her mood ring turns from blue to pink
concentrating on the layout of the store trip peers all the way to the back to a darkened corner
where he spies a little kid wearing a kiss tee shirt playing a kiss pinball machine
the eagle has spotted a fuzzy little bunny
he moves in for the kill walking past a crowd of kids at the magazine rack past the hostess aisle past the dairy cooler and into the darkened corner
he stands behind the little kid relishing this moment
the kid is actually pretty good
we also see now the little kid has his face painted like ace frehley
hey little kid
suddenly distracted the kid loses the ball
you just skunked my last ball you
trip clamps a hand over the little kids mouth
okay booger your kiss ticket or your life
the little kid says something but trips hand muffles his words
the kid says what he said before but it is utterly incomprehensible once again thanks to trips hand
looking at his hand oh
but scream and youll never live to see puberty
ill pop your fuckin face in
trip pulls his hand away
please sir dont beat me up
i do have a kiss ticket but not on me
a likely story
hand it over kid
bottom lip quivering no really
my brothers hanging onto it for safe keeping
please let me get him for you
the kid turns and yells into the store before trip can stop him
a titanic guy at the comic book rack looks up from his issue of thing when he hears his name
chongo has a very low forehead and the expression of an angry bull plastered onto his face
getting scared hey kid thats okay
i dont wanna see kiss that ba
dont try to run maggot
chongos an all state track star in every event
what do you want
gleefully a tag on your toe
nobody threatens me and lives
look you can have my wallet
its not nearly enough punk
chongo is getting ever closer with his tree trunk legs his barrel chest and hydraulic biceps
he is joined by two buds
besides i was gonna take your wallet anyway
after chongo and his friends crush your ribcage like a pack of luckys
chongo arrives eyeing trip with distaste
trip goes white
this fairy givin you shit bro
he was gonna mug me for my kiss ticket
i said do you know where i can take a piss
chongo and his two buds laugh
then without a second of warning chongo belts trip in the gut
trip doubles over and falls breathlessly to his knees
okay pimple dick youve got the option of walking outside with us or gettin dragged out
either way youre comin with us
trip catches his breath
please sir dont kick my ass
ill do anything to get out of a beating
say chongo perhaps we could use some extra cash for tasty snacks at the kiss concert our weasly friend wont be attending
chongo scratches his head
how much cash do you figure
take five for a minute chongo
let me do the math
the little kid taps his finger on his chin and the theme from jeopardy begins
while the kid thinks trip looks nervously up at chongo and his buds
chongo reaches into his denim vest pocket and we hear a crinkling noise
he comes back up with two walnuts putting them between his bicep and forearm
trip watches in horror as chongo makes a muscle and the walnuts are shelled between two walls of iron hard flesh
chongo eats the walnuts shells and all
the full to capacity parking lot is patrolled by a couple of lex cautiously makes his way to the edge of the parking lot and looks at the back side
of cobo hall just beyond the chain link fence that surrounds the lot
he crouches down and walks between two cars parked against the fence looking both ways
seeing a guards flashlight beam he sits stock still until the beam sweeps past then sighs eased
whispering to self i cant believe im actually entertaining the notion of sneaking in
i oughta have my cranium examined
lex finds a vertical break in the chain link
he lays on his back slides through then stands on the other side of the fence
hes at the edge of a weedy littery field that also happens to be poorly lit
danger will robinson
spooked he lays down again intending to slide back through when a flashlight beam hits his eyes
get back in here
lex sees the guard standing about fifty feet away on the other side of the fence
panicking he bolts deeper into the field
youre not getting far kid
lex double times it as we hear the guard yelling into his walkie talkie
we got one just ran into the field from the north lot
the field gets darker as lex closes in on cobo halls well lit loading dock where roadies empty the remaining bits of kisss monstrous set from an wheeler
other huge trucks are parked nearby
theres a bustle of last minute activity
lex scurries from giant speaker box to a stack of lights to huge trunks keeping well hidden
he dodges roadies and avoids being seen by other guards
he slithers along side the wheeler and nears the loading bay
up ahead some auxiliary speakers drum kits and scaffolding wait their turn to be carried into the building
there he is
the security guard flanked by two others barrel right for him
he dives rolls under the wheeler
the three security guards leap for the pavement and crawl under the semi after him
the three guards scramble to their feet and grab a scrawny body
they spin him around roughly
alright wiseguy you are so outta here
they suddenly realize theyve got the wrong man
its a roadie
hey what the fuck
the roadie holds up his all access laminate angrily
keep your paws to yourself ya dumb fuckin apes
the security guards look around frantically for lex as other roadies join in to defend their comrade
whered he go
you see him
no one pays attention as a bass drum is carried past the guards and up the loading dock ramp
they dont notice lex crammed inside contorted into a shape befitting a yoga master
praying he wont be spotted lex holds his breath as hes carried into the building and disappears
jam sits in the front pew head buried in his hands as mrs
bruce and the priest talk on the alter
beth moves quietly in the back unseen and unheard
she looks overwhelmed by the architecture the detail on the stained glass windows the icons carved into the columns that support the extravagantly decorated ceiling
the priest catches a glimpse of beth meandering in the back
uh next mass isnt until tomorrow morning young lady
run along now
beth smiles nervously and heads back toward the front door passing a confessional booth
she throws a glance back at the priest and mrs
bruce who have returned to conferring their backs to her
she stealthily ducks into the booth
now its been a while since my boy had holy confession
smiling consider it done
bruce looks down at jam and sees his drumsticks poking out of his socks
she immediately takes them out and stuffs them into her jacket
jam doesnt even move
its about time you gave up on that stupid dream once and for all
no son of mine is going to be a career musician
jam is stung
bruce and the priest head back down the center aisle exiting through the gigantic front doors
she eyes jam
thank you father
ill be back for him before you know it after i take care of some unfinished business
just knock loudly sister
he lets her out and locks the door leaving the keys in the lock and walks over to jam
come along son
get into the booth
he helps the despondent jam up
they walk to the booth and jam reluctantly gets inside
jam kneels on the board and a mere two feet behind him beth sits on a bench shrouded in darkness
her posture is that of someone with a crate of nitroglycerine on her lap
we hear the shuffling noise of the priest getting into his own compartment next door
a moment later the small eye level door slides open
the priests face is barely visible on the other side of the thick screen but hes there
forgive me father for i have sinned
this is my first confession in
a really long time
prepare to receive the act of penance
how many sins have you committed since your last confession
just one father but boy was it a doozy
beth leans forward slightly and listens to jams confession
hawks at a bar stool gulping sloppily and woozily from a rocks glass
four more empty rocks glasses sit in front of him
he stares at the sexy woman who smiles back blowing him kisses from the other side of the bar
the emcee enters the stage
into microphone okay ladies hang onto your hormones
here comes our next amateur
lets have a big hand for hawk
the beginning of a rockin kiss tune comes over the p
and dicky approaches hawk
youre up hawk
hawk wakes up fast
theres nothing more sobering than having to undress in public
oh dicky i c c cant
youre not gonna chicken out on me now are you
weve got your kiss song playing and everything
i i c cant
leans in close look people undress in public because a theyre exhibitionists b theyre nutcases or c they need the money
i can tell youre not a and i hope to hell youre not b
so my suggestion is think about why youre a c and let your body party shake your groove thing boogie oogie oogie till you just cant boogie no more
hawk thinks about it then downs the rest of his drink
he grimaces at its taste then opens his eyes with new resolve
youre right dicky
i gotta do it for kiss
gotta put a bag over its head and hiccup do it for kiss
hawk swivels his bar stool to the right and gets off forgetting to stand when his feet hit the floor
he proceeds to fall flat on his face
dicky looks down concerned but hawk stands with a little difficulty and heads for the stage
the crowd of women parts down the middle for him and checks him out as he walks by
they seem to like what they see
hawk looks nervously at the carnivorous faces leering at his package first his ass after
what the hell is he doing
hawk reluctantly climbs onto the stage and the gals start clapping to the song
he faces them and starts gyrating his drunken hips at them feeling no confidence whatsoever until
the cheers start to echo and the pulsing lights begin to hurt his eyes
hawk watches the world proceed to spin faster than the disco ball above his head
he stops gyrating and clutches his stomach
hawk spots an almost empty beer pitcher one of the cheering in slow motion women holds above her head
he runs up to the edge of the stage grabs the pitcher and pukes
the cheering and music come to a grinding halt
you can hear a pin drop as hawk yacks his guts out into the beer pitcher
it goes on for an excruciatingly long time then finally stops
hawk looks up at the hundreds of astonished eyes staring at him
he wipes his mouth then a look of ease washes over his face
i feel a hundred times better
he hands the vomit filled pitcher back to the shocked woman
he looks over at the emcee who gazes at hawk from the dj booth
as you were
the emcee stands perfectly still jaw agape
come on dude we got a bunch of frisky felines waiting for some entertainment
the show must go on
hawk starts gyrating even though the music is still off
the emcee shrugs re cuing the song
it starts again as hawk faces the crowd dancing with new found bravado
the women come out of their dumbstruck comas and reluctantly start clapping again
hawk pulls off his jacket and twirls it over his head roger daltry style
then he pulls it back down and tosses it into the crowd
the women actually fight over it
encouraged hawk then peels off his kiss army tee shirt and hurls it at the women who squeal with delight
sure he may be scrawny but they dont mind
this lads got personality
adrenaline pumping confidence building hawk starts playing the crowd of very responsive ladies
he unbuttons his jeans first
then leaving them on he does an air guitar medley chuck berry zz top angus young from ac dc and elvis costello in six easy steps
hawk finishes off with a pete townshend windmill shaking his ass at his audience in mid strum then licks his finger and touches one of his cheeks hot stuff he
does this in a manly way of course
then hawk pauses to adjust what looks to be his underwear bunching up in his crack
the women whoo hoo
he segues into a mick jagger rooster strut and the ladies go ga ga
he makes the sign of the horns with each hand and wiggles a protruding tongue like gene simmons
the gals scream in orgastic joy
then hawk goes for the gold
yes he does the fonzie dance
the women are now overcome by sheer animal lust
hawks whipped his audience into a frenzied pack of bitches in heat
amanda smirks and sucks from her little drink straw suggestively
at long last hawk figures he has to give them what they want
he puts his fingers to his fly pauses then unzips
his brittanias fall to his ankles revealing a pair of bony legs sticking down from some kiss boxer shorts
the ladies go batty
unfortunately hawk has neglected a cardinal rule of disrobing
never pull your pants down without taking your shoes off first
he tries to kick off his shoes
the left one goes flying across the bar and thwack beans a middle aged woman in the face
she flies backwards over a chair
trying to kick the other shoe off hawk loses his balance and falls backwards hitting his head on the edge of the bar
trip looks at the little kid chongo and the two buds in fear
two hundred bucks
you heard me nad breath
my times precious and i think thats a reasonable price to pay for your sorry life
look i want to live but i dont know where the fuck im gonna find two hundred bucks
the little kid shakes his head in disgust
take him outside and tear his ass out through his mouth
chongo advances muscles flexing
i know how i can get the money
i just figured it out
only you might wanna wait outside
the little kid and chongo look at each other
i dont trust him
i think hes on the level
hes too stupid to try anything sneaky anyway
look at him hes a moron
they look back at trip
you got fifteen minutes and not a second longer
we have a concert to go to
see you outside
trip nods sullenly as the kid chongo and the two buds exit
then he checks to make sure stretch armstrong is still with him
lex is twisted like a pretzel as hes carted into the bowels of cobo hall
he tries to keep calm but its not in his nature
under his breath keep it together lex
anything worth fighting for is worth dying for
roadies and techies run in all directions as last minute preparations are being attended to
two roadies carry the base drum down a long ramp unaware that lex is hidden inside
boy this ones heavy
suddenly roadie snags his foot on a mess of cable and loses his balance dropping the oversized drum
in an instant the drum goes rolling down the ramp quickly gaining speed
the roadies bolt after the runaway drum
other workers scurry out of the way to avoid being hit by the speeding instrument
lex spins like in a dryer on speed
more techies jump out of the way as the wayward drum heads right for a closed set of double doors
the roadies are just about to grab it before impact when
the door unexpectedly swings open
the foxy groupies on the other side scream at the sight of the careening drum heading straight for them
close that door
the groupies jump away as the drum flies through the open door and down a flight of stairs
the drum bounces down the zigzag stairway violently
lexs grunts of pain can be heard from inside
the big drum hits the landing hard tips over then spins like a quarter getting faster before it stops
they barrel down the stairs two at a time
finally reaching the bottom they grab the drum
peters gonna kill us
as they carry the drum back up the stairs we see it is now empty
once the roadies are gone camera tilts up to the ceiling
theres lex clutching exposed pipes for dear life hanging upside down praying the coast is clear
jam is at the end of his confession
the priest is still listening on the other side of the screen
beth sits in the shadows behind jam
so you see if it wasnt for me me and my friends would be at that kiss concert right now
well this is a unique confession to say the least son
and not exactly the most interesting one ive ever heard either
you sure you dont want to talk about
oh carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher maybe
or how about finding a box of magazines under your dads bed
well then i suggest you have a seat on the bench behind you and think of something a little juicier to confess than losing kiss tickets
i realize this is detroit but i personally find what that rock and roll band is all about to be boring as lucifers kingdom
ill return in a little while
the priest slides the door shut again
jam is all but shrouded in darkness but can make out the time on his watch
its getting late
he resignedly sits on the bench behind him
right on beths lap
jam yells but beth throws her hand over his mouth
his eyes bulge
he cant believe what hes seeing
he climbs off beth and sits next to her
i cant believe it
jam thinks for a beat
something still isnt quite clicking
are you waiting for confession
i thought you were jewish
beth can hardly speak
she gulps thinking of what to say
i have a confession
here it is
beth gives him the biggest wettest sloppiest kiss in recorded history
she pulls away finally wiping her mouth
i didnt mean for that to be so
i dont care
i wanna hear more
she lunges at him again kissing him for dear life
her lips leave his and begin to explore his chin neck ear
ive loved you ever since i first laid eyes on you jeremiah
ive just always been too scared to show it
beth i cant believe you just said that because thats exactly how ive always felt about you
call me jam
its my band name
you dont know how long ive been waiting to hear that
he kisses her neck
unable to stop they start undressing each other both breathing heavy
weve got to take this slow
oh screw it
she tears his tee shirt open with her teeth
a really buff stripper dressed as a construction worker is on stage with about ten others who stand in the background
the emcees hand hovers above the strippers head
okay ladies its down to
troy the human jackhammer
the women applaud as we
follow the emcees hand to hawk who holds an ice pack on the side of his head
massive head wound accompanied by an upset stomach hawk
the women applaud but not quite as loud
the grand prize of seventy five dollars goes to troy the human jackhammer
the women cheer and a disco song starts as troy does a reprise of his act
hawk walks away from the stage with the rest of the rejected strippers looking the way he feels pretty damn stupid
he puts on his pants trying to walk at the same time and falls to his knees
a helpful hand grabs him under the arm and helps him up
its amanda looking lustier than ever
youre too kind
right well thanks for the drinks and stuff amanda but theres no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore
dont be so glum hawk
the nights still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities
id be in a position to spend some money on you if youd get in a position and spend some time on me
jam and beth lay buck naked tightly wrapped around each other in the heat of passion on the confessional booth floor
they kiss sweat and pant heavily
suddenly the sliding door to the priests booth opens
jam and beth freeze
where are you son
uhh tying my shoe
so have you thought of a colorful confession yet
last year i walked out of a candy store with a reggie bar i hadnt paid for but went back and apologized the next day
think boy think
we hear the door slide shut again as beth and jam pick up where they left off
trip leafs through a kiss comic not really paying attention to it
directly behind him is the register and the cashier
he starts hearing voices in his head
we see supers of his friends faces hovering around him
i cant believe youre even thinking of committing a robbery trip
you dont pass go and collect dollars for pulling stuff like this
no shit dude is this really worth it
sure you get your ass kicked nine ways to sunday by that fucking gorilla but its still a hundred times better than getting it porked for the next three to
trip sends brief agitated glances around the store meeting the cashiers eyes again
she smiles at him coyly as she plays with her mood ring
he gives her the eye then returns to his comic
and what about that girl trip
shell never forget this night
even if you get away with it shell be scarred for life
when are you gonna realize sometimes being tough means being tender
to the other voices alright everybody shut up
trip snaps out of it
all the shoppers and cashier are starring at him
he coughs loudly clearing his throat to cover his outburst
the shoppers go back to shopping
a man with a long coat enters the store looks around then takes a spot alongside trip and opens a mad magazine
whispering to himself okay bro
you gonna have to do this sometime
might as well be now
trip puts a hand in his pocket and takes one last look at stretch armstrong before stuffing the action figure back in so it looks like hes got a gun
he takes three deep breaths and discreetly pulls his knit cap down over his eyes revealing it actually as a semi ski mask that covers the top half of his
just then the man with the coat puts the magazine back and pulls something over his own head
trip whirls around pointing stretch in his pocket at the cashier
just as the man in the coat now masked with a stocking pulls the biggest shotgun ever made from under his coat pointing it at the cashier as well
the cashier shrieks
so does trip
yknow what i am what this is and what you have to do so do it quick
to shoppers trip included the rest of you kindly introduce yourselves to the floor and kiss it hello
his thunder now stolen trip drops to the floor along with everyone else
the air is very tense
the cashier starts sobbing keeping her hands in the air
to cashier do or die bitch
next time i let the barrels do the talking
p p please mister im just a high school kid
man with the coat cocks the chamber and the cashier immediately opens the register drawer and starts emptying it
fuck school thats what i say
i just went through the motions till i was old enough to drop out and im leaving here with at least two fifty the easy way
look where all that studyings gonna get you tonight
robbed at gunpoint and possibly shot in the fucking head
for minimum wage
the man with the coats laughter echoes in trips head till he just cant take it anymore
she suddenly shoots a surprise glance over the man with the coats shoulder
seeing this the man spins around
theres trip behind him
alright drop it or ill kick your ass
astounded by trips audacity the man with the coat turns his shotgun point blank at trip
you and what army
gulps the kiss army
your wildest fantasy of a rock shows backstage area come true
the place is packed with beautiful people
scantily clad babes everywhere
slick record biz types
lots of food
lots of booze
lots of fun
its backstage at a kiss concert come on
camera tilts up above the partying hordes to find lex shimming along an exposed duct amid the pipes sprinklers and vents
looking straight down on everybody lex is in awe and disbelief
this is real
this is not a dream
this is real
ive pierced the inner circle
he takes the opportunity to peer down some big busted girls cleavage
then his eye spots something else
on it a star
written on the star the word kiss
oh god theyre in there
a big haired hipster in mirrored sunglasses knocks on the dressing room door
it opens but lex cant see inside
the hipster stands in the doorway talking to whoever is there
lex cranes his neck to see around the door jamb
desperate for a glimpse of his idols he leans out too far
suddenly the entire duct collapses
breaking loose of the ceiling lex hurls to the floor clutching the duct
backstage goers leap for cover as smash
he hits the ground in a shower of plaster and dust
the hipster protectively pulls the dressing room door shut as two security men jump in front of it
instantly huge burly hands come down on lexs shoulders
before he can react a slew of officers have him off his feet and carry him away a stunned expression frozen to his face
lex is thrown into a heaping garbage dumpster by the scruff of his neck
the security officers laugh and pat themselves on the back as they hurry back in
lex peeks out the lid
the alley is dark and spooky
he jumps out of the trash and comes face to face with the biggest german shepherd that has ever lived
its teeth are bared and its black wolf like body is coiled ready to spring
lex jumps backward hitting the dumpster
a growling pitbull walks out from the shadows and joins the shepherd
why did it have to be dogs
then a growling doberman with a spiked collar emerges from the darkness on the other side of the alley its solid muscular form making the brick building nearby look like
lex starts slapping himself on the face
wake up lex
wake up man
this parts gotta be a nightmare
he stops when several other dogs emerge from the shadows and gather behind the first three
these new mutts immediately join in the growling chorale
the shepherd snaps at lex
to the heavens god if you ever get me outta this i swear i will never masturbate again
the pack barks even louder
to heaven again beth lays in jams arms on the floor
they might as well be the only two people on the face of the earth
is it true that gene simmons had a cows tongue grafted onto his real one
yknow to make it so long
i think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther
im not too up on gene trivia
your man is the drummer peter criss right
peter criss is my inspiration man
if i paid a hundred bucks for a kiss show and all i saw was his solo id consider it
hey howd you know that
i have all your notebook doodles memorized jam
she opens her backpack and pulls out a package addressed to jam
the return address reads beth bumsteen somewhere in ann arbor
my dads company is relocating him
thats why i was acting so freaky in school today
i thought it was the last time id ever see you
anyway open the box
i would have given it to you this morning except
like i said i was freaking out
jam opens the box and his jaw drops
its a black tee shirt with the mystery logo printed in white on the chest
jam holds it up
i pass by this really cool tee shirt shop on my way to school every day and i know you wear those black tee shirts all the time
you look like a size thirty five but all the sizes were in roman numerals
so i got you an xxxl
thats thirty five isnt it
touched jam kisses her for a long time
he starts putting on the shirt when suddenly they hear the shuffling of the priest entering his booth
jam grabs his clothes and sits back on the bench
beth starts getting dressed at his feet
okay you better have something really sinful for me this time son
my patience is worn to threads and your mom will be here any minute
pulling up his pants alright father here it is
about two weeks ago i went to my cousins wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if i wanted to take a bath
beth is tying her shoes
jam slips on his socks
i was insulted so i asked her if i was wreaking some wicked b
then she said no she wanted to take a bath with me
oh this is terrible
please go on
well she was a very tempting siren father
built like you wouldnt believe
so i gave into temptation about a block away from the wedding reception at this little motel that charges by the hour
when she peeled off that gown youll never guess what she was wearing underneath
was it a teddy
fully dressed beth crawls out of the confessional
i mean much more sinful than that
tell you what
you keep guessing and ill say something when you get it
i love a good game of name that nightie
jam quietly sneaks out
we can hear the priests voice as jam hurries to beth
they dash out the door
leopard skin bra
leather g string
still trapped by the growling barking pack of dogs lex searches nervously through the garbage behind him
okay okay youre pissed off
i can see this
maybe what we need
lex holds up a worn out old frisbee
play some frisbee poochies
the pack just glares and snarls
he tosses the frisbee over the packs heads but the dogs dont even acknowledge it
they just keep barking and growling
meanwhile an unnoticed dog at the rear of the pack a mangy basset hound turns its flat head to see the frisbee land on the ground behind him
his tail starts to wag
i give up
i hearby and forthwith defer my destiny to you mutts
i may be an intelligent upright walking homo fucking sapien but you fleabags are a force of nature
so im just gonna sit here and wait for you to decide
if you let me live i thank you
if you bite my head off ill die knowing i did all i could
its up to you
lex waits before the growling snapping canines
suddenly the basset hound runs up in front of the pack and drops the frisbee at lexs feet
lex looks down at the floppy wrinkly dog who wags its tail and pants furiously
well how do you like that
lex starts to pet the hound and one by one the rest of the dogs shut up
shocked lex picks the frisbee up again and throws it
this time the entire pack bolts after the whammo product
lex smiles watching them fight for it in the air
in slow motion
as the theme from chariots of fire begins
the black shepherd finally grabs the frisbee in its mouth and runs back toward lex
its soon joined by the rest of the pack
thats right about when lex realizes they arent going to stop
the dogs plow into lex full force knocking him into the garbage
they surround him licking his face
lex bursts into unstoppable laughter
pulling himself up he pets the dogs as they jump around him wagging their tails and panting
baby talk you sonsofbitches could tickle a guy to death yknow that
sure you do
sure you do
he hears talking coming from inside the windowless brick building on the other side of the alley
he steps in front of the pack and puts his fingers to his lips
they obey quieting instantly
he then tiptoes to a thin crack in the brick wall
the dogs quietly follow
lex puts his eye to the crack and peers in
his moms volvo and a bmw are on adjacent hydraulic lifts inside a makeshift auto mechanic shop
two beefy jerks with blow torches stand next to the cars
one has a bandage on his head and seems to be in pain
so i jump into the car hot wire it in thirty seconds and start driving
then suddenly i hear this scream
the disco queen was asleep in the back seat
beefy jerk laughs
you think its funny
how would you like to have a stiletto heel smacking you in the temple when youre tryin to work
beefy jerk laughs more
beefy jerk checks the time
you about done splittin a gut there
we gotta get these parts to toledo by nine
then a familiar voice is heard coming from the back of the shop
then maybe you guysll let me go huh
lex follows the voice and sees christine handcuffed to a radiator near the rear of the shop
come on whadaya say
you scratch my back i scratch yours
you let me go and in return i keep my big mouth shut about your little operation here
mum know what i mean
youre lucky youre still alive wench
if you was a guy we woulda thought nothin of sawing your head off with a butter knife
what are we gonna do with her anyway
beefy jerk bares whats left of his yellow crusty teeth i dunno but she sure looks fun
beefy jerk touches the bandage on his head
yeah and paybacks a bitch
christine gags at the thought
lexs eyeball bulges with terror
dolly from the front end of a jaguar xke michigan vanity plate reading amanda
to its windshield through which we see hawk and amanda kissing in the front seat clad only in their underwear
something like me and mrs
jones plays on the radio
when they separate amanda takes out a flask and offers it to hawk
he gulps some down and pulls the flask away coughing
what the hell is that
some of this hard liquors a tad too manly for me
im a brewski man myself
better ease up then hawk
wouldnt want to give you whiskey dick would we
whos whiskey dick
amanda plants a stocking foot on hawks crotch and rubs
obviously no one you have to worry about
my names not woody its haw haw
hawks eyes cross as he lets out a deep obnoxious groan
amanda looks down at his crotch
but you do know premature peter dont you
shame i just bought these stockings
hawk has never been more embarrassed
well amanda this has been quite a night
so far youve seen me and my dick throw up
to the heavens whats next
beat to amanda man
what a stud huh
believe it or not you still have a way to go before you start competing with my soon to be ex husband
the champion of lousy lovemaking
the man who thinks hes the biggest and the best
the man who thinks every secretary stewardess and cocktail waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor
the man for whom faking it was invented
christ if i hadnt gotten pregnant with our son i would have never known i even had sex with the prick
she takes a healthy swig of gin relishing its bitterness
you love him
i just told you hes a big hairy
no i mean
you love your son
more than anything in the world
and he loves you back doesnt he
hes a little spoiled but i know he does
well shame on him if he doesnt
she pats his shoulder
hawk stares out the windshield
my mom died of a heart attack while she was having me
man i wish i had known her for even one day
if they ever invent a time machine thats what im doing
going back in time to meet my mom
im gonna say mrs
or miss williams depending on when i show up
you dont know me but im your kid from the future
just wanted to thank you for the blue eyes pug nose and for tying the knot with a guy who didnt mind diaper detail
oh and uh
cut down on the red meat will ya
amanda caresses hawks cheek
he turns with her hand and kisses it
he takes her arm and begins kissing his way up to her neck her cheek her mouth
its a stand off
prone customers look up at trip and the man with the long coat circling each other like sharks
the helpless cashier lets out fearful sobs
gimme your gun boy
no you gimme your gun boy
dont tempt me ill shoot
not if i shoot first
i dont even think you have a gun
neither do i
the man with the coat puts his shotgun against trips head
now for the last time take the piece out and lay back down or your moms gonna need the white tornado to get the brains outta your ski cap
the jigs up
he slowly pulls out stretch armstrong and the man with the coat glances down and starts to laugh very loud
so loud he throws his head back
when he recovers trips got stretch aimed at his head and pulled back to maximum tension
smile you sonofa
trip lets go
the man gets it right in the face and falls backward onto the hostess display toppling a whole bunch of ho hos ding dongs twinkies and suzy os to the
trip runs up and grabs the shotgun away as the man with the coat lifts his head briefly then passes out
trip turns around and the cashier slams into him nearly knocking him over
she throws her arms around him letting out relieved sobs
behind her all the customers rise from the floor clapping
trip did it
he saved the fucking store
the cashier looks into trips masked eyes
who are you
with confidence call me
she plants a thousand mega watt kiss on his lips and we zoom in on her mood ring changing color from gray to fire engine red
trips eyes widen just before
the shotgun hes holding goes off blowing a hole in the ceiling
the recoil from the blast jolts trip and the cashier apart
we now see trips face is smeared with bright red lipstick
a huge chunk of ceiling falls onto his head but he doesnt move
the kiss hit him harder
christine and the beefy jerks watch the brown volvo ohio plates ob gyn ascend on a hydraulic lift
behind them sits the bmw skeleton
these boys work fast
you guys better kill me before you do what youre thinking of doing
cause when im mad enough i can bite down very hard
the beefy jerks laughs
sweet polly purebreds got some spunk huh
ill give her some spunk alright
they put their blow torches down and turn to her
we stripped that beemer in fifteen minutes
bet we can strip her in fifteen seconds
they giggle maniacally and lumber toward christine
their shadows growing larger and larger across her
mile a minute now wait a minute guys
two against one aint fair
lemme go back and get my friend barbara
youd love her
tits the size of your head
youll feel like a little baby sucking on em
i swear ill bring her right back
itll be a four way
you guys like disco
i teach disco dancing at my church
you guys look like you got rhythm in your blood
come on free lessons if you let me go
i know a dance we can do
the horizontal hustle
they both laugh
just as theyre about to grab her
suddenly the garage door behind them slides up revealing darkness
christine and the beefy jerks look out anxiously
silence except for crickets
from out of the darkness emerges a figure
christines eyes brighten like a bulb
im here for the girl and the car
you can try to stop me but i must warn you it may be hazardous to your health
the beefy jerks laugh at this little punk
they start toward him one with a tire iron the other a big monkey wrench
he was such a young idiot
he was a stupid boy
he deserved to die
lex lets out a quick high pitched whistle
the pack of barking dogs led by the shepherd the pit bull the doberman and the basset hound step from the darkness and flank lex growling and snarling at the
listen to them
children of the night
what music they make
hounds of hell
say hello to dinner
the beefy jerks drop their tools on their feet and yelp in pain
the pack takes this as a threat and charge the beefy jerks who bolt for a glass partitioned office
the dogs scratch and bark at the window ferociously
lex smiles at christine
she smiles back
he presses the down button on the lift and the volvo descends
lex yells to the beefy jerks through the glass
one foot out of that office and your asses are alpo
lex unlocks christine
she leaps into his arms
youre cooler than the fonz
she gives him a lingering kiss
lex leans back gives the double thumbs up and says
lex takes her hand and they walk over to the volvo
lex lets her in then rounds the car to the drivers side
hey what about the dogs
you got a phone in there
lex drips a dry smile onto them
call the cops
the beefy jerks watch in disbelief as the volvo screeches out of the chop shop
beths parents wait in the running car as jam and beth share a heartfelt good bye outside the back door
ann arbor isnt
that far from cleveland right
once i get my own wheels i could come up all the time
thatd be great
hey maybe someday your bandll play there
its a college town you know
jam takes her hands
i feel like such an idiot
why didnt i just say something a year and a half ago
man think of how much time we wasted
lets not think about the past
lets just think about from today on
ill never forget you jam
tell me about it
church will never be the same again
they stare at each other for a really long time
dad looks back out the window and clears his flustered coming dad
to jam ill call you
soon as we get a phone
she gets in the car
they both wave as the impala turns a corner out of sight
jam is left alone still waving long after shes gone
amanda and hawk are half dressed post coitus
she looks in her purse
amanda as ironic as this is gonna sound i cant take any money for
im no midnight cowboy yknow
it would only cheapen the whole deal for me
im not paying you for the lovemaking hawk
i just want you to have whatever you needed the money for when you took me up on my offer
she forces the money into his palm
youre a good man hawk
the cashier shoppers and a gathering crowd watch two cops load the dazed man with the coat into a cruiser
to cashier you wouldnt happen to know where we could find this
love would you
its company policy to hand over a cash reward of a hundred and fifty dollars to anyone who stops a robbery
i gave him the money and he took off
the cops shrug and get into the cruiser
okay well thanks anyway
and let us know if you happen to see him again
wed like to ask him some questions
the cruiser takes off and the cashier stares at her mood ring
it throbs red like a beating heart
sighing to herself if i see dr
love any time soon youre gonna have to wait till im done with him first
we find trip counting his money out to the little kid chongo and their two buds
hundred forty hundred fifty
thats all i got
the little kid puts the money in his pocket
i really wanted things to work out for you my weasly dim witted friend
you got spunk
to chongo chongo give him a fifty dollar wallop
chongo reels back and
right in trips face
trip flies off his feet into the smiley mart brick wall with a thud
a bag of weed drops from his jacket then some uppers a few sheets of acid and finally a can of beer rolls out
hey the jerkoffs got drugs
consider it a bonus chongo
chongo laughs like an ejaculating gorilla as he and his two buds scoop it all up
the little kid chongo and the buds leave trip lying in a puddle of his own nose blood
he pulls out stretch armstrong and looks at him fondly
misty eyed at least i still got you stretch
trip looks up
the six year olds who he stole it from stand close by having watched the whole humiliating exchange
licked trip tosses the doll to them
they both dash away with it giggling
christine sits in an idling taxi taking money from lex who stands outside the window
this oughta be enough to get you to disco inferno christine
its not too late for you to catch the fever
no can do
but i made a promise to get you to that disco and we kiss maniacs are men of our word
youre pretty cool
for a stella i mean
christine takes his hand and writes something on his palm in lipstick
heres my number
tell me how cool i am over the phone sometime
she gives lex a kiss then pushes him away
to cabbie disco inferno on the double
the taxi screeches away as lex smiles and gets back into the volvo
jam approaches the stadium passing the matmoks walking straight up to mrs
her back is to him
he taps her on the shoulder
her jaw drops
it escaped again
and what an ugly tee shirt
im gonna ask you nicely first
mom can i have my drumsticks back
taken aback by his confidence mrs
bruce grabs his ear and tries to pull him away
he wont budge
again can i have my drumsticks
a bunch of idiots walk by with big transistor radios
one of them holds a mr
microphone and heckles the matmoks
hey im on the radio
hi good lookin
well be back to pick you up later
bruce yells at jam through her bullhorn
drumsticks are the least of your worries young man
you are in a world of
jam yanks the mr
microphone from the lead idiot and screams at his mother his voice amplified on the transistors
i know mom ive been in trouble for about twelve hours now
the other matmoks turn to look as jam climbs onto a trash receptacle and shouts down at his mother his face slowly turning purple
im gonna be spending the next two years of my life at st
bernards boarding school remember
im gonna be outta your hair till im a legal adult remember
that way all you have to do is go to church light a candle pray to a little statue for me and voila
all is forgiven and forgotten right mom
then you can spend your days in guilt free pursuit of more constructive activities like telling everybody else how screwed up their lives are
that way you no longer need the patience and understanding required to communicate on some normal level with your own child
and that way you dont even have to think about how tough it was for you when you were growing up and its a good thing too
cause if you did youd realize what a lousy goddamn shitty the crowd of kiss fans applaud jams rant
bruce is utterly winded from the assault
whats gotten into you
microphone i just lost my virginity in a confessional booth
lord have mercy
the crowd cheers
jam jumps down and hands the mr
microphone back to the lead idiot
he turns to his mom
for the last time mom
let me have my fucking drumsticks
bruce reaches into the trash finds the drumsticks and hands them to him
he spins them like pistols then stuffs them into his socks and walks away
hawk runs to the scalper across the street whos selling a ticket to another kiss fan
that better not be the last ticket
i hope you have another one for me
the scalper sees hawk and bolts down the street disappearing around a corner
hes lost him
hawk sulks to the now familiar intersection where all four landmarks meet
he takes one more look up the block at cobo hall
nearly all the kiss fans are inside
the streets are almost deserted
he sees someone out of the corner of his eye across the street
lex approaches the other corner
trip comes up to the forth corner
they all stop when they see each other
each standing on his own corner
theyre all pissed
they meet in the middle of the street as last minute concert goers hurry by
plenty but it was all bad
i found the volvo
they all shake no
well dudes the only way were gonna see kiss this tour is by some fuckin miracle
suddenly a commotion up the street
a surly mom yanks four year old brats dressed like kiss by the scruffs of their necks
shes furious theyre crying
how dare you sneak out of the house like that
you had me worried to death
dont you know this is detroit
and for a degenerate band like kiss
theyre sick sick sick and oughta be in jail with their vile antics
she throws a wad of paper to the pavement as they pass our four heroes
the dudes watch her pull the brats away
just wait until your father gets ahold of you
jam hawk lex and trip turn and look at the crumpled wad at their feet
its an envelope
an angelic spotlight from above highlights it
you dont think
they all shake their heads in unison resolved that it isnt
then unable to control themselves they dive for the envelope
jam tears it open
his trembling hand reaches in
all their eyes focus like lasers on whats inside
jam pulls out four kiss tickets
their jaws drop
their eyes bug
its a miracle
the boys are practically moved to tears
its divine intervention at its finest
suddenly a greasy hand juts out of nowhere and grabs the tickets
the boys look up shocked
they cant believe it
fire in his eyes
mania on his mind
and tickets in his hand
laughing hysterically whose laughing now
whose laughing now ya little shits
i told ya
over my dead body
ha ha haaa
arms outstretched take it easy elvis
dont do anything crazy
just give me the tickets before someone gets hurt
hey wait a minute
this aint school property
hes not the boss of us here
crazed thats right
this aint school
its not about school anymore
now its personal
come on elvis
we was only kiddin
its all in good fun
we run you chase
cat and mouse
boys this time
elvis stuffs all four tickets in his mouth and chews crazily
in seconds gulp
elvis explodes into unhinged laughter as he runs away zigzagged down the street
our boys are left dumbstruck and speechless
after a really long pause
i still got my idea if anybody will let me speak
beaten go ahead jam
we all beat each other up then once were nice and bruised we run over to the ticket takers and say we got mugged and our tickets were stolen
they gotta let us in then
they stand and think for a moment
hawks mouth curls into a devilish grin
then he lets out a gigantic aieee
and slugs jam
the four boys brutally pummel one another in the middle of the intersection
two ticket takers are letting the last kiss fans in
theyre about to close the doors when our four bloodied and bruised heroes come running up
dude you gotta let us in
four muggers just stole our tickets
sceptical you expect us to believe that
look at us
trip points into the crowd of fans inside the auditorium foyer
it was those assholes
they even stole my wallet
the ticket takers turn to see the little kid chongo and their two buds just going in
the ticket takers signal two security guards who proceed to stop the four stunned kids and confiscate their tickets
they find all the stolen dope and trips wallet
inside that youll find my kiss army picture i
and a hundred fifty bucks cash
the security guards see hes right and break out the cuffs
to little kid tsk
i was really hoping things would work out for you my weasly midget friend
you got spunk
the little kid for once is speechless
then the ticket taker extends his arm in slow motion into cobo hall as if to say entrez vous
the four friends pause
this is it
they take a few slow steps almost as if they dont believe it then run like the wind into the auditorium
the lights are out
the lighters have been lit
the crowds roar is deafening
jam hawk trip and lex plow their way through the throngs and head straight for the front row just as simple simon takes the stage
you wanted the best
and you got the best
the hottest band in the world
simple simon runs from the stage just as the opening chords to detroit rock city begin
on the beat boom fireworks shoot from the floor alighting the place
kiss takes the stage descending on hydraulic elevators
theyre seeing god
the show is spectacular
the make up
the blitzkrieg of pyrotechnics
the flashing kiss sign
aces smoking guitar
genes spewing fire
pauls rockin vocals
peters kick ass beat
then something really weird happens
the crowd behind the boys heaves forward
jam is pushed like a twig in a flood and over the shoulders of those in front of him
purely by accident he is thrown onto the stage landing on his stomach between paul and gene
just before peters drum solo is about to start
gene paul and ace silence their instruments
peter throws his drumstick into the air intending to catch it when it comes down
but the sight of jam landing on the stage distracts him
all is mute as peter misses the drumstick
it hits the outside edge of one of the drums
thinking fast jam grabs one of his drumsticks out of his sock and tosses it to peter
it tumbles through the air in slow motion with a low whooping helicopter sound
we see the word mystery clearly as it twirls
instantly its caught in peter crisss hand and he brings it down on his drum not missing a beat
the song resumes with all its fury as peters drum kit ascends on a hydraulic platform
jam scrambles from the stage and leaps back into the audience barely missing the claws of some security guards
the four friends pound on each other with unbridled teenage exuberance
will it ever get any better than this
