written by joe carnahan a narration accompanies this passage the events depicted herein were believed have taken place in lake tahoe nevada
all manner of record as they might pertain to these events have been seized by the department of justice wall to wall surveillance set up
two fbi agents donald carruthers s and richard messner s man the post staring at video monitors
both hold telephoto images shaky long lens shots of a mansion some distance away
messner tacks photographs to a corkboard on the van wall
one is labeled subject sidney k
serna underboss sparazza family
the other is labeled subject victor baby buzz padiche lieutenant sparazza family
voices begin emitting over the vans speakers

messner adjusts the record level v u meters spike modulate
the figure on the monitors paces the room

chances are theyre gonna get into some shit too hafta put people down
thats not a problem
are we goin outta pocket ourselves
yeah i can front this
well just so i got a quote in my head
whats the rate for the swede
thats the punchline yready
a million flat
the ace of hearts spinning through mid air slow motion end over end
bullets blast big sizzling holes through it
neon framed doors fly open as a slicked back chump with a store bought tan strides out onto the strip swinging underage bar bait on each arm
hes all strut and punk swagger grinning like a geek who just struck gold
buddy israel nicknamed aces born a bastard mom laverne chased the pipe dream from a dairy queen in kansas city to the vegas stage
two months after stepping off a greyhound she gets knocked up by some hood
a row of chorus girls gilded like gold flaked flamingos rubbing coca butter on bare midriffs
the camera finds buddys mother laverne prominent bulge seriously pregnant shes arguing with her employers trying to suck in her belly yelling bullshit you just have to light it right
biological abandons her and the showgirl thing goes sideways so she winds up working as a magicians assistant to make extra cash
second rate dive bar
laverne israel assists a pompadour maned magician on stage
in the lounge sitting on a strippers lap a young buddy plays with a deck of cards
bamboo style ceiling fans circulate cigar smoke and shitty attitudes
at a billiard table in the back jack dupree s third generation bail bondsman talks with hollis elmore s and pistol pete deeks s ex vegas vice cops
as dupree speaks we see the scenes behind the story and young buddy learns everything about cards from this mandrake motherfucker his mom is working for
the magician being brutally beaten pelted with poker chips kicked in the chops pissed on the works
but magic man was also a degenerate gambler and got caught dealing bottom deck at a mob owned poker parlor
beat he didnt get outta there with much more than a pulse
the magician full body cast taking his meals through a straw
young israel labors over him performing card tricks
point is he passed on all this slight of hand shit onto aces and the kid is sick with it
by the age of twelve buddy israel is positively prodigal with a deck of cards
by sixteen hes headlining the mgms main room
buddy cards and coins dancing off his fingertips dazzling sold out crowds
laverne israel sits in the front row decked out in ankle length fur applauding wildly
dupree rounds the table lines up a shot leans over it
this punk is pulling down ten bills a night and more showgirl geech than you can shake a stick at
four years of sold out shows he becomes the unofficial mob mascot buddy meets mob hierarchy silk suits and pinkie rings
dupree contd v
contd by the tender age of twenty one hes breaking bread with the wheels keeping company with major muscle
and it goes to his head in a big way buddy poolside glass of top dollar dom in hand
chicks coopertone and chasm deep cleavage abound
wiseguys start to think this sonofabitch is a mystic something special
and aces plays it up lets the legend grow takes time off from his stage act and starts showcasing the chip on his shoulder
buddy tipping a craps table attacking the stick man stripping off one of his gold chains going garotte
he buys into his bullshit building street cred hes got plans and pull hes makin plays living the mob life for real
somehow it takes lounge act turned legitimate thug
dupree rips the eight ball corner pocket
in reality he doesnt know the ball from the bounce
hes not a crook so he starts fucking up fast and picking up speed putting a floodlight on the whole carlotta organization
cops get curious start camping out compiling names and faces and pretty soon israels bullshit has brought the heat to bear on none other than primo sparraza
we recognize carruthers and messner as the two agents from the padiche serna surveillance
they are sitting with f
deputy director stanley locke
a debrief is in progress
a mafia family tree has been erected behind them with a photo of primo sparazza at the top
sparazza is rumored to have performed in excess of one hundred and thirty contract murders including one of the bureaus most celebrated agents
you heard of the turnpike murders that was sparazza
i thought heller was a double op
freeman heller s clean cut cornell grad class of
hes on a pistol range scoring perfect marks
he worked for the o
before joining the bureau in its heyday
he was the first operative assigned with infiltrating the mob
heller outdistancing the rest of his recruiting class in a training run nearly a mile ahead of the next man
full immersion and assimilation fake identity falsified background everything that is now standard operating procedure heller implemented way back when
heller oversees every aspect of his transformation radically altering his appearance adding different mannerisms an accent etc
befuddled fbi brass can only look on in awe
and as a result his undercover work was wildly successful
he eventually reached the rank of capo inside the carlotta crime family
but through some internal slip up his cover was compromised and primo sparazza was given the contract to kill him
a ford fairlane flush with an embankment bullet perforated dead body draped
a top coated gunman presumably primo sparazza stalks the vehicles sole survivor freeman heller faux mafioso full time federal agent
there wasnt enough evidence to bring formal charges so the case never went to trial
heller collapses the gunman looms over levels a
sparazza is a bit of a specter
over the years the serious crimes with which he was thought to be involved including hellers murder could never be traced back to him
the gunman slinks back to his car as we locke stands distributes files
a dedicated viciousness and a slavish devotion to mob doctrine had sparazzas star on the rise
so the mob relocated him to nevada and he became the unofficial head of the las vegas lcn
a photograph of primo sparraza sharkskin suit vintage s coif posing in front of the riviera with a dour pissed off frank sinatra
so hes personally issued the contract on israel
sparazza was the one who introduced israel to the life gave him his first big break brought him through the ranks
made him a friend of the family
sparazza and israel casino grand opening flashbulbs burst
his hand picked protege successor to the throne
and israel played the situation very shrewd
a montage of more photo pos buddy israel posing with mob power brokers playmakers
smiling all the way to the top
slowly amassing the loyalties of sparazzas top men
with plans of toppling the throne
buddy late night conspiratorial confab with sparazza soldier
in doing so he plunged the carlotta organization into a civil war splitting the family into dual factions
sparazza on one side israel on the other
the infighting that followed drew the interest of nearly every major investigative body operating under the canopy of the federal government
stakeout teams snap photos plant bugs wire hidden cameras
locke contd v
presently there are sixteen state and federally funded agencies running concurrent criminal probes on select members of the lcn
locke contd v
contd being the primary target in virtually every investigation
israel sits with a group of fbi agents discusses a deal
a marked man gets wise and wants to come in
his testimony has the potential of blowing the lid off whats left of the la cosa nostra is this country
that alone warrants total immunity from prosecution and and a vanishing act with witness protection
israel is walked out of the room as we cut back to so the wiretaps we conducted on serna and padiche the mention of israels heart
your intel corroborates what we already know
sparazzas health is in rapid decline and before his date with destiny it seems he wants one last thing
the heart of his sworn enemy
a recently opened cash rich escrow account has been traced back to sparazza
this and the mention of this mysterious swede makes the million dollar contract on israel very real
greasy spoon soul food joint packed lunch counter
meet sharice watters and georgia sykes ebony stunners ghetto queens street assassins
they are sitting with their booking contact lorenzo wyman
he holds up a copy of a bank telex sliding it across the table

the feds continue their briefing
like pasquale acosta blood money mercenary
his countrymen have dubbed him the more dubious el estrago beat the plague
death personified sun cooked skin black hole eyes tattoos gouged out of prison boredom
this is pasquale acosta
american educated fluent in over a dozen languages did journeymans work for cia funded g and archivo death squads in guatemala and chile
noted for his legendary torture techniques
acosta clips car battery cables to the eyelids of a dissident
flash to acosta scorching an off camera scrotum with a blowtorch
flash to acosta powering up a bore drill as a semi nude man screams and pleads
sought for war crimes and human rights violations in eighteen different countries
when he was caught by the sas in northern ireland and imprisoned he chewed off his fingertips to the bone before he could be printed and idd by interpol
pasquale prison cell filthy feasting on his fingers
on an extradition flight back to el salvador he murdered a security detachment and vanished
you think its possible he could be involved in the israel hit
acosta is pure mercenary
and a million dollar hit fee will draw some huge flies
but forget about sparazzas money for a moment and remember theres no shortage of those who want israel killed and no shortage of cash to do just that
then im sure youve heard of these guys
the tremor brothers
dupree chalks his cue positions for a shot
off dull stares from deeks and elmore then youve both been living under the same rock cuz these cocksuckers are infamous
three brothers same skank mom different deadbeat dads used for that suicide kamikaze style shit
you heard about that huge shoot out in cleveland
is that the club that got wiped out a couple months back
the teamsters had a reform measure going to ballot that didnt sit too well with the local syndicate
night of the polling big black tie to do downtown and the tremor brothers crash the party
the tremor brothers pilot a dodge barracuda right through the front window with wrecking ball bravado
bodies scatter as the tremors deploy from the car in full body kevlar doing doomsday on the club
one of them fires up a chainsaw chewing into the panicked crowd
bodyguards blast back but bullets play like spitballs against the tremors body armor
donald mcgarey the local union rep is the mark
the tremors go ripshit riot on the whole club seven people dead twenty eight wounded
just to get to this one guy
shotguns roar blast spreads obliterate a shitstorm of blood spilled booze and busted glass and they get it about as good as they give it
in the melee one of the brothers catches blowback from a jammed piece and is temporarily blinded the other takes bullets to the lower back and cant walk
the third gets popped in the neck and passes out
mcgarey gets out of the club alive
and not much further
the blind tremor walking wounded piggybacking his brother with the bum back dragging the other by the scruff of his neck unconscious across the concrete
police sirens squeal
mcgarey the union guy hairpiece hanging by a thread crawling toward his car
the piggyback tremor brother reaches into his blind brothers coat grabs a revolver and unloads
long live the teamsters
dupree chalks his cue
theyre speed freaks neo nazis
sworn to the swastika supposedly read and recite mein kampf like mother goose
and these motherfuckers can go megaton at the drop of a hat
whats the name again
wyman sykes and watters back at the greasy spoon
soot lazlo soot
lotta folks want this white boy clapped
soot could be workin for one em
crammed pedestrian crossing noon hour a trio of suits converse shrouded by bodyguards
nobody really certain where he come from
the party proceeds through the crosswalk approaching them is a dark suited man expressionless hands in his pockets
others move past a woman with shopping bags a skateboard punk a geriatric dog walker and a man full paralysis mouth op wheelchair my left foot palsy
and when he moves on somebody they the last ones tsee it comin the bodyguards perk up sensing something
dark suit removing his hands from his pockets cellphone
the crippled cat throwing a quilt off his lap contorted face vanishing two uzi machine pistols up safeties off triggers pulled bap
the bodyguards get caught napping bullets blaze point blank
the three suits collapse
the phony invalid empties both guns hops up from the wheelchair hooks a passing truck and flees the scene
that was lazlo soot
so what do you think
the boys have retired to the bar for a round of dollar drafts
i think its idiotic to continue this conversation
turns to deeks were ex cops which means we werent great cops or even good ones
paying bills with bullshit casino jobs sitting watch on slot machines
which was a great gig until we we walked in here and started drinking
the bond on israel expires in eighteen hours after that its a jump ball
our window is now
who posted his bail
dupree pats himself down searching for his cigs
his law firm same one that hired me
israel walked out after he made bail and nobodys seen him since
jack if the rumors hold and israel is really the great white whale of snitches then the mob is looking to put all kinds of bullets into his ass and
pour some serious psychotics into the mix to do just that
so what real incentive is there to track him on something as small time as a skip trace when its putting you and yours in the path of severe pain
and suffering and an almost certain prelude to doom
dupree blows smoke flicks ash
so i guess youre not going
shit if youre on a crazy jag why stop there why not take fort knox with a fucking slingshot or go into hell after hitler
i like your chances a lot more
dupree stubbing his cigarette
i know his location weve got the drop of a maybe half a day before that location gets grape vined and the rest of the world gets hipped
thats already happened hoss
its naive to think otherwise
where is he
watters nodding wiping red sauce off her fingers
three hours tthe east
pretty this time ayear too
sykes sets her fork down wipes her hands on a napkin
we gotta lay something out strategy wise
ygo in there ad libbing its yass
what are we talkin on the split
forty five apiece for you two ten percent finders fee for me
whats the time frame
right mafuckn now girl
fast as we can get you there
we wait any longer someone goin dead this fool
then we lose our witness
the briefing continues
we lose our case
twenty four hours from now hes scheduled to meet with federal prosecutors
his agent a man by the name of morris mecklen has guaranteed us that hell enter into protective custody once his deal is approved
morris mecklen s bloated bad combover agent to the vegas vanguard
he sits at his desk jawing into the phone
on the wall framed photos wayne newton buddy hackett carol channing and a triple chinned near the end elvis
weve been monitoring mecklens calls and have learned that israel is staying in the penthouse level of the nomad hotel and casino in lake tahoe nevada under an assumed name
in the high roller suite
its the last place theyd look
israels legal representation the firm of culpepper brody and reed which is currently the subject of a joint sec and treasury department probe were left holding the bag after he
over three quarters of a million dollars on a bond thats set to expire in less than a day
rupert reed one of the firms partners has learned of israels whereabouts and dispatched a local bondsman by the name of jack dupree to pick him up and return him
to las vegas
that cant happen
beat we have a gulf stream standing by at reagan international to transport you two to lake tahoe
pause with weight its very simple gentlemen
valacchi fratiano gravano no former witness against the mob has been as crucial or has brought more to bear on the potential dissolution of the la cosa nostra than buddy
over this entire sequence we hear agent locke speaking the cylinder of a
magnum is popped a speed load dropped in spun and snapped shut porn mags and crossword puzzle compendiums are tossed into a carry on
morphine and adrenaline syringes get spiked and capped a collection of wigs fake sideburns and moustaches get laid out separated
but understand that if an attempt is made on his life
kevlar body armor gets stowed an elephant gun gets buffed to a high shine vintage ww german potato masher hand grenades are lovingly wrapped in terry cloth towels
then it is being made by those of the strictest professional caliber
torture tools curved cutting implements serrated bone saws skull keys a portable blowtorch blackened with burned blood
all packed neatly into a duffel bag they are cold blooded ruthless and without restraint
and they must not succeed
a gun is aimed a trigger pulled
sunlight streams in soft suffusion the color of good scotch
primo sparazza lies on a hospital bed an o mask shrouding deep set sunken eyes cataract grey gazing out at a four walled world
someone enters the room awaiting approval to approach
sparazza turning seeing the man summoning him over with a feeble finger wag
the man reaches him kneeling down ring kissing reverent whispering hes here now
the man exits
after a moment the door opens again
and another man enters walking slowly toward sparazzas bedside
he sets down his luggage a black leather valise
the travel tags originate in stockholm the swede has arrived
soaring across the pristine deep blue waters of lake tahoe
rising revealing the gaudy mirrored glass tower of the nomad hotel casino
we slowly dissolve to
buddy israel bathrobe boxers bags under his eyes
he absently shuffles cards pulling aces as if by touch telepathy
he gazes out at the snow packed peaks
behind him post bacchanalia
the ugly morning after
prostitutes passed out cold in a tangle of crotchless panties and stiletto heels lying amongst smashed vodka bottles and ashtrays coke covered tabletops and tipped room service trays
israel sober now
contemptuous of it all
he starts walking around them the way you would casualties on a battlefield
his bathrobe brushes over terrycloth catching one of the hookers wigs tugging it free
israel looks down zooming in on her scalp sees dandruff and scars gags disgust and disdain
he steps the wigs pulls
he stops and slips the bathrobe off letting it fall rather than pull her wig the rest of the way off and ruin what illusion remains
he shuffles begins dropping aces on their bodies like dead enemy soldiers
one of his bodyguards enters a bulging slow witted ex bodybuilder by the name of hugo croop
dyou talk tom
fetching mylanta from the fridge i got his machine
israel fidgets twitches rubs coke residue from his nose and over his gumline whatd you say
gulping mylanta i said i got his machine
no what did you say on the machine
i left him a message
i know you left him a message
what did you say
hugo looks up seems confused
israel the patience of a gorilla crammed into a canary cage
how is it that you can turn a simple conversation into a fucking hedge maze
this is zero degree of difficulty man
then why are you still looking at me like im asking for the square root of something
what did you say
hugo still unsure speaks in spite of it
i said that we were returning his call and you were real concerned because he sounded real concerned
look at that we didnt have to fill up the whole blackboard after all
now do you know anything about that
israel wrist flicks a playing card it embeds a sofa cushion like a ninja throwing star right next to a beige coat
look at the collar on that coat
hugo wary walking over inspecting the coat from a distance
whats that look like that stain
hugo edges closer looks down at the coat squints
no good guess though
no hugo that looks like jizz
reshuffles stares and im no forensic expert mind you but that looks like some fuckhead shot their load on a twelve thousand dollar calfs skin jacket
its my twelve thousand dollar calfs skin jacket
beat then so ygot semen human ejaculate
checks watch thats been allowed to soak in for what six seven hours now
work its way into the fabric fuckn fibers and while you may never see it in a tide commercial i think it still safely qualifies as a tough deep down
hugo takes another pull off the mylanta bottle moving slowly like most morons do avoiding eye contact at all cost
i could have it sent out
cuz im almost dead certain theres not a fucking laundry detergent or dry cleaning process known to man that can ever return that jacket to its former glory
some shit suffice it to say just dont wash out
beat cooling down now the money question
to whom does that stain belong
hugo gameface falling apart
israel prods him
cmon somebody was banging one of these skanks sans rubber beat assesses girls which is terrifying in its own right pulled out let er rip and ruined the last gift
my mother gave me before she died
snatching up coat the way i see it its the same as if she was dug up three months dead and it was shot right on her rotting corpse cuz
thats how it defiled this feels
big dumb blush
do you want me to say i did it
i was kinda hoping yeah
do you want me to say im sorry
only if you really truly mean it
hugo swallowing pressures on
the phone begins to ring
are you a fucking colossal idiot
i uh yeah i guess yeah
cards dance israels hands moves at lightspeed he reaches into hugos shirt front and pulls a playing card out
showing him the card no
you stand alone on that summit
the phone rings
hugo wobbly what to do
buddy fires all fifty two cards into his face
the beast barely blinks

hugo furtive look to the floor all those scattered cards then back to the boss should i
the cards can stay there

a cellphone being lifted revealing special agent carruthers
listens checks watch were three miles from the nomad now

messner sets the gear on the floorboard stretches
he turns over photographs of victor padiche and sidney serna

sorry comes later when youre in a partial coma with ambulatory paralysis

lake tahoe nevada
ill have hugo book your flight you can be here in a couple hours
hell meet you at the airport
gill holds for a moment clicks over to another line dials a new number
hes in lake tahoe
buddy still standing there next to the phone wincing breathing shallow looking down rubbing his chest
be cool be cool be cool
he walks over to the bureau cut lines of coke await him
he bends inserts a rolled hundred into his nostril
just this last little bit then were done just this tiny bit and thats it thats it all of it over he snorts
beanie trying to assist the ailing hooker
she lurches suddenly retching projectile vomit dousing beanies versace dripping dung like from his shirt front
awwww motherfuck me
hold your shit
this is silk
the other hookers titters turn to outright guffaws
barf girl takes umbrage hurls her purse at them rushing into the herd throwing haymakers asswild snatching wigs sinking fake nails into skin snapping them off van helsing style
the fur flies a slugfest free for all
ivy intervenes beanie jumps into the fray separating combatants one of
them wielding her pump heel like a pick axe
hugo heads another off hooker hitting her like a blitzing linebacker
israel who has walked back out looks on with total disdain for what hes seeing
then he catches his reflection in a living room mirror a profound sense of sadness there
to himself quiet how the mighty have fallen
in the distance on the lake a small boat a man sitting inside gazing up through a pair of binoculars
the feds occupy a booth black coffee for both
carruthers clicks off a cellphone
messner is engrossed in a file clipped with old surveillance photographs of primo sparazza
spotter on the lake confirmed israel
there was apparently a fisticuffs with some prostitutes
he wasnt involved
hes also had his people phone a local madame for another group of girls
no rest for the wicked
beat holds up file why were we never shown these files
were sitting on sparazza for what
six months now and were just seeing this
beat reading did you know that hes has had thirty six major medical procedures performed on him since
flips reads elective plastic surgery every single one messner turning the file toward carruthers pointing
look at this look at the work hes had done nose three times eyes eyelids chin jaw hes had his jaw done a dozen times
you take every hasbeen actor in hollywood they havent been cut this much
messner flips to another part of the file
unreal this guys jacket too
wall to wall major felony offenses murder extortion arson grand larceny beat points a paternity suit
i just feel like were playing catch up with all this and we shouldnt be
welcome to the new bureau
nobody shares information anymore its become synonymous with job security
based on what we had i thought sparazza was a mid level player at best and it turns out hes this mob relic running the show out west
carruthers nods sips his coffee
hes stayed below the radar
you dont kill a hundred and thirty people without knowing how to tip toe
messner flips the file finds a page paper clipped with a photograph of murder martyred federal agent freeman heller
but the bureau knew sparazza killed heller
why not go after him guns blazing for that one
heller was buried in agency lore anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed hoover blackballed their memory
look at ness
yeah but the untouchables took down capone
heller got shot and killed
the bad guys beat him
worse sparazza walked
messner sits back kills the remainder of his coffee gazing out the window watching sightseers stream by
carruthers glances at his watch
its almost five a
locke said the lawyers from justice had been in there since three oclock yesterday afternoon
israels manager is acting as his attorney and thats whats holding things up
the waitress arrives with breakfast sets it down
so he has no idea whats about to happen
and i want to be in that room a half second after mecklen calls to say the deals done
weve got a sheriffs task force on stand by
what about the hotel staff obstructing us
israels obviously paid off the management
tampering with a witness extraction of this magnitude makes everyone indictable at the federal level
beat grins trust me we wont any problems with the hotel staff
you show em your id with the letters f
in all caps and its instant compliance
ive seen in happen a hundred times
it fills the the frame
voice explains special agent gerald diego federal bureau of investigation san francisco field office
pull back to reveal gerald diego
aka pasquale acosta aka el estrago the most notorious torture murder specialist in the biz in convincing disguise
his suit mannerisms and speech
hes got the fake fed bit down cold
were conducting a series of impromptu inspections for the nevada gaming
id like to speak with your head of security
a pimply casino employee nods dashing off to find the boss
acosta glances around takes in the eight dollar an hour security the array of quasi armed guards
whered you get these
guard uniforms exactly like those weve just seen worn by the nomads security staff
maroon with burnished gold buttons and brown piping down the slacks
three separate vestments laid out across the trunk of a rental car
dupree and deeks in an empty parking lot bundled up in windbreakers battling the frozen spindrift swirling in off the lake
same place that rents the guards uniforms
theres a shift change at am
graveyard goes home and we can blend in with the day shift coming on
what about access cards
well have to get our hands on them
theres two separate units casino floor count room security and general hotel security annoyed nods to car does he want to hear this or what
deeks bangs on the hood of the car
elmore steps out moving slowly to the rear of the car
nobody put a gun to your head
elmore leans against the bumper bored
yeah weve been through that
then quit acting like somebody shit in your cereal bowl
reed just gave us fifty grand
jack what am i doing
im standing here arent i
beat to both men shouldnt that be enough
that i made the trip
your attitude sucks
i been accused of worse
glancing at uniforms what do we got
dupree dubious does he continue
two security levels the one were going in under the guise of hotel security has restricted access
theyre mostly there to monitor the lobby handle disturbances on the different floors and toss out drunks
beat theres a thirty five member employee rotation going from graveyard to day shift
if we split up we can blend in and enter unnoticed
once were inside the hotel well regroup
then what a plymouth barracuda passes by brakes hard reverses
the trio stop talking look over
and then their lives end
bad intentions blaze from the drivers side machine gun bursts dupree is hit flush dead on his feet his dying thought cut comically short i had that car in high
scho deeks shredded where he stands his body absorbing a fusillade of rounds traveling at twice the speed of sound
one creases elmores skull another blows out deeks back fragmenting claiming three fingers from elmores left hand
the three of them fall in weird waterlogged flops no dying breaths no death rattles just lights out
just like that
several seconds pass
then the car door opens and the tremor brothers like circus clowns clamber out in a cloud of gun and reefer smoke
lester tremor the dandruff caked pockmarked middle brother is the first out
he shakes off the cold yawning stretching revealing all manner of tattoo
the tremors youngest brother the baby huey sized jeeves tremor bumbles out pulling at his crotch
he unzips rips baptizing the cudas tire with a truly prodigious piss
darwin tremor climbs from the car the eldest brother straw boss brains of the outfit
he looks down at the dead men seems saddened by their state
some remorse maybe
still pissing luvin that rat tat tat tat clean as a nuns snatch on kristal nacht
stops singing shut up fuckass them spirits aint vacated yet skeep quiet
them spirts can kiss my chinese ass
this exchange prompts jeeves to turn and urinate on lester
lester squeals war cry launching a wild windmill barrage on his behemoth little brother
jeeves ignores the hydrant like urine stream soaking them both and starts swinging back
darwin kneels down over the dead jack dupree taking jacks face in his hand and squeezing back and forth adding his own words in what amounts to a freakish ventriloquist
i forgive you darwin
shoot i appreciate that man
if i needed your i
and your car and me and my brothers were wanted by the law i woulda killed you to get em too
oh hell yeah
wes just in the wrong place at the wrong time
so dont feel so bad dude
i dont mind now anyway
you know up here in heaven its beautiful
way better than fuckin hawaii or any place like that
darwins eyes begin to well the tears coming slowly
in the background lester and jeeves beat e ach other ruthlessly
im glad im here
i love it
im gonna get laid by some fine ass angels and then go hang out with jesus and them
darwin wipes his eyes
man thats great
i got it made in the shade amigo
hey ill see you up here some day dont worry
you think so
darwin uses his thumb and forefinger to make it appear as though dupree were smiling up at him
i know so
darwin smiles back down at the corpse wiping his nose on his sleeve
he reaches down and pulls out duprees wallet
he spots the bondsmans license eyeballs the bail papers he sees the name robert israel in bold type
puts it together
you was after the same sacka shit as us
darwin continues the pat down pauses pulls the envelope with fifty grand inside fingers fresh bills
with his free hand he manipulates duprees dead mouth one last time
dont tell your asshole brothers you know about it that money is for you old boy
darwin a nod of acknowledgement for the dead dupree
i appreciate that pard
i wish i coulda been a better friend
darwin stands his eyes move to the guards uniforms still laid out across the trunk
he looks over at his two brothers jeeves now with a lenny like hammerlock on lesters head
alright enough grabassin goddamit

watters is once again on her cellphone to lorenzo
on the phone so everythings cool then
we sat down with padiche he tried to get some details which we wasnt gonna give up but its all good
we goin check sis in first fore i check in across the street
sykes arrives at the reception counter when the elevators open and israels hookers post brawl bruised bloodied and barefoot come staggering out
they slur insults at the security team broken heels slung over their shoulders wigs misaligned miniskirts mangled
sykes trades looks with watters as if assessing something nodding almost imperceptibly to one another
watters then winks something sexual there
it gives sykes the shivers
the hookers are surrounded by a horde of hotel staff and summarily whisked away
watters joins sykes
the woman behind the counter checking sykes in looks up to see watters
will you be needing a room with two double beds
quickly no were not together
watters a grin
cmon baby dont be shy
to woman just one bed please
beat to sykes smiling although if we sweat that one up we goin need some clean sheets
as sykes pulls away cmon girl you know im playing
sykes looks uneasily at the counter woman who keeps her eyes locked on the computer in front of her
over her shoulder to the departing hookers if yall let hoochie like that stay up in here yall must be burning sheets by the ton
the woman just smiles that monstrously insincere im here to help
smile offering nothing in response
you just goin grin
yaint goin comment on that at all

beat closer bitches like those are the same ones runnin feminism right to the brink girl
bitches like that the reason mafuckas dont take our species seriously

sykes embarrassed nudging watters knock it off
bitches like that make me weep for what could be if we could all sisters everywhere black white yellow and brown put our shit down one time unified front the
force of the female race mobilized moving as one
the woman smile severely strained the pro feminist diatribe falling on decidedly deaf ears
an awkward beat then im gonna need a mini bar key too
a mini bar being opened
a hand reaching in extracting two small bottles of jack daniels whiskey and a bottle of seltzer
the figure crosses the room pouring the seltzer onto a towel
he kneels down dabbing a spot on the carpet fresh spill deep red indelible
the seltzer doesnt bring it up
the stain remains smeared now but unmistakable
the figure stands
in the bathroom behind him we see a body male late s trussed up hung by his feet over the tub and bled out
the figure walks in takes a polaroid turns it upside down near the mans face and fires off a photo
he crosses back into the bedroom
the resulting photo is tucked into the corner of a dresser mirror as it develops
as the figure sits we pan over to reveal lazlo soot world class assassin slash master of disguise
the slowly developing polaroid depicts the same face that we now see in the mirror
soot touches up the putty and plastic appliances on his face smoothing sealing
he takes up a small micro cassette recorder rewinds pushes play
a butlers uniform steamed and pressed hangs on the door
he takes it down and begins changing into it
he glances over at the bed
the dead mans voice crackles back over the recorder
i am an employee i i dont know wh they dont let me speak to h say your name
then say how can i be of assistance
soot back to the mirror buttoning his collar straightening his cuffs smoothing out the creases
i dont understand
i didnt ask for your understanding
i asked you to say your name followed by the phrase how can i be of assistance
soot looks down at the silencer fitted mm pistol lying on the vanity
a pause then my name is vitoli
how can i be of assistance
a muffled gunshot sounds
the recorder abruptly shuts off
soot gazing at his reflection now rewinds the recorder replays listens gauging the mans vocal patterns rough baltic accent throaty warble excessive smoke booze exposure tracheal damage
tough to match
he rehearses one
my name is vitoli
how can i be of assistance
he grimaces grabs cigarettes off the bureau lights wails smokestack puffing three at once bellows like lungfuls he grabs an aerosol can from the same bureau strafes the back of
his throat pops the tops on the bottles of jack kills them both gags sputters recovers adjusts himself
suddenly the phone begins to ring
soot stops stares
after another ring he lifts the receiver into phone cautious this is vitoli
how can i be of assistance
hugo croops voice booms from the earpiece

ive been calling for fifteen minutes we need you up here to clean now
israel sequestered to his bedroom lying on a baby grand piano its legs inexplicably sawed off during the previous nights hedonism
in his hands the de riguer deck of cards restlessly shuffled and reshuffled

morris mecklen sleepless sweat rings blossoming armpit to waist
he picks at the plate of room service food in front of him
a group of feds and fed lawyers linger in the b

mecklen glances back over his shoulder lowering his voice

if we push this theyll revoke your protective status which nullifies any agreement you got with the government
now thats mate and checkmate kiddo and once that happens the shitll start falling down around your ears real fast
buddys head teeters back bangs on the keys sour chords thinking
he takes the deck firing the cards up in a perfect column above his head snatching one random out of the air with his right
he turns it over looks
in the shadows at the far end of the room tucked into the midday shadows ivy listens as his boss betrays them all
israel just rolled
the feds heading toward their car carruthers snaps his cellphone shut

gerald diego alias pasquale acosta speaking with bill security supervisor for the nomad
banks of video monitors surround them displaying the various gaming areas and vip floors
two of the screens are completely blacked out
to bill can i speak to you privately
the supervisor nods dismisses his staff calls after one
gary lets get our personnel up in the catwalk over twelve that stickman has been acting odd and i dont like the rolls that table has been getting
acosta waits for the door to close leaving only himself and the supervisor in the room
its gotta be tough keeping an eye on everything
and everybody all the time
yeah its a chore
acosta laughs keeps it loose
so bill if i understand this right you currently have your penthouse floor under construction
points to monitors but with these down doesnt that pose a major security concern if as you say you have to keep an eye on everything at all times
well we were worried about dust and debris from the work being done ruining the cameras so so you shut them off
the supervisor quick to amend
yes but no we have personnel stationed at both ends of that hall twenty four hours a day
what kind of personnel
the nomads crack unit security staffers cum bodyguards the casinos version of a swat team six ex cop military types bowling buddies brushcuts and potguts they carry colt
autos religiously kept strictly range fired
a six man security force plus a member of our butler staff
so seven men total
you have a butler working that floor
vitoli aka lazlo soot stepping onto a lower floor elevator pushing a service cart tucking the mm into his waistband
the supervisor sputters stammers realizes he just slipped
uh well yes uh just in terms of the men up there now my team hes serving lunch and dinner and just doing general upkeep so so there are no
guests staying on that floor
the supervisor makes a big show of the headshake no
none at present
acosta grins takes a step closer
youve got some sultan up there one of your whales big spender likes a lot of space you cook up this construction thing
no no no
weve been looking to renovate that area of our hotel for some time now
the security team is only present to preserve floor integrity due to the roof access
is your security team armed
and who has access to that floor
something like suspicion in his eyes
the secure hotline begins to ring
the supervisor looks over at the phone then back at acosta
the unflappable pro
bill listen i can ask you now and you can answer me or i can drag you up to san francisco and depose you in front of a federal judge
because thats where were headed here
bullshit but it sounds good
the supervisor starts for the ringing hotline
im sorry but im going to need to see your identification again
were covering some sensitive material here and i need to safeguard myself im sure you can understand
acosta reaching into his coat
of course but if you could just tell me who has access to that floor the supervisor touches a pass key that he wears on a chain around his neck
as he moves to answer the phone
i hold the sole pass key and personally relieve the shifts myself
now if i could get your id we can acosta coming out of his coat fake id in hand the supervisor reaching for it and the ringing phone simultaneously suddenly
a six inch spring loaded stiletto blade explodes from acostas sleeve piercing the id pinning it to the supervisors chest
a surprised grunt from the man as blood begins to pour from his punctured sternum
the blade retracts
the phone sits trembling in the supervisors hand a voice carruthers tinny and barely audible warbles from the other end over phone hello
this is special agent donald carruthers of the fbi i need an acosta takes the phone from the stunned supervisor replacing it on the console
the supervisor still confused by the exchange wanting to speak but unsure of what to say
he gazes down to the red blossom fanning across his shirt front
acosta pockets his id as he yanks the pass key off the supervisors neck
his natural accent returns
yes it is and right now its filling your lungs
in less than a minute youll asphyxiate and pass out
you shouldnt be feeling any pain now
the supervisors knees begin to buckle nervous system slowly shutting down
acosta steadies him easing him to the floor
close your eyes
think of something wonderful
dont make this face the last thing you ever see
beat in spanish heaven may hold it against you
the supervisor unblinking an almost childlike clarity there
am i really dying
bill out of respect willliam
pause were all dying
bill the supervisor almost smiles as he breathes his last breath
acosta checks for a pulse then drags his body toward a service closet
as he passes one of the video monitors
we see on screen the employee entrance grave and swing shifts on their way out day shift on its way in
mixed in with this personnel rotation each doing his inconspicuous best
the brothers tremor
darwin lester and jeeves clad in full security attire standing apart so as not to appear together heads down hands shoved into their pockets
darwin bird dogs both his brothers monitoring their movement using hand signals and some bizarre inbred semaphore to communicate with them
they pass through and punch in signing time sheets
the surrounding security staff oblivious to the new faces
the brothers enter the lower floors moving through the hotels fitness center and indoor pool
a kid does a cannonball as they pass as we
a clouded bog coming to consciousness then retching gagged gasps throat ablaze with bile liquid clearing convulsed lungs breath in burning spasms not enough air
elmore sits up in the sub zero shallows of lake tahoe with a start stripped naked shaking uncontrollably his skin a deep bruised blue
dull pain quickly defines pinpoints bores in bone deep
death cant hurt this much
he gets his breathing under control the onset of hypothermia turning his fingertips black his left hand lighter three digits he looks comprehension sparks but cant catch he stares impassively
at the ragged space for the moment he doesnt seem to mind their absence
he gropes the side of his head bullet graze blood congealed by the cold the concussion he suffered has left a massive migraine behind
he crawls from the water muscles cramping knotting up
he reaches the sand unable to pull himself up any further
he turns back sees the bodies of deeks and dupree face down the lazy lake tide gently lifting and lowering them
double homicide gunshot vics both of em dumped in the lake
thats where the sheriffs task force is
carruthers and messner hectic speeding through the south shore of lake tahoe cellphones pinned to their ears
back into his phone deputy have you made any ids
cups phone to messner get a coroners estimate too
back into his cell miss ive been transferred and i was disconnected
no one is answering and i need someone from security to pick up that line
messner nodding as he listens
dep deputy im going to put you on speaker i have agent carruthers in the car with me
beat to carruthers you need to hear this
messner clicks over the deputies voice fills the car
nd have a pending id on a jack dupree appears to be a bondsman out of las vegas
he was just rolled and printed by our medical examiner
messner and carruthers trade looks
was there anything recovered
we found a handwritten receipt in his pocket for what looks like uniform rentals
the name and phone number of the rental house wasnt listed what kind of uniforms
receipt wasnt specific the uniforms were just listed as maroon in color
carruthers mashes the floorboard brakes smoke power swerve slicing the rented taurus across four lanes of traffic
alright deputy well be there as soon as possible until we arrive i need you to limit physical access and restrict movement to and from the crime scene
messner clicks off
have you been able to get through to the nomads security

carruthers pushes mph barreling toward the nomad blowing through traffic both men pull out ifb earpiece apparatus plugging in checking their signals

carruthers pulls a

hes accompanied by two sparazza thugs who quickly escort him to an awaiting car
the swede looks over sees gill at the payphone
the two seem to acknowledge one another as the swede quickly climbs into the car and closes the door a door opens revealing vitoli the butler aka lazlo soot standing

beanie slams the door on him
soot inside now scanning making split second evaluations whats where whos where he picks up voices from the master bedroom clothing everywhere
israels top dollar wardrobe designer suits wadded up into balls and stuffed into a garment bag
hes doing more cocaine talking to himself babbling the classic addicts dont worry itll to be alright monologue
why isnt hugo at the airport

ivy his menace gone malignant quietly stepping out of the shadows
israel has no idea that hes been there all along

ivy doesnt budge just stands there staring hard

but its all good right
israel almost chokes on his own smile nodding
so were all traveling together getting sworn giving our statements israel starts zipping up some of his bags
i dunno the way its gonna play out but yeah itll probably go something like that
ivy unbuttons his coat
cal rides in his shoulder rig
israel averts his eyes
ivy lets the moment load up
then you believe in loyalty dontcha
pause then specially the kind of loyalty where an otherwise sensible motherfucker puts his own best interests aside to selflessly serve another
cuz outside a goddamn dog that kinda loyalty my kinda shit dont get any more dedicated or deep or devout
israel unnerved now spots a small handgun sticking out of his bag
he covers it with the bedspread looking up at ivy
what are you tryin to say
what ive been saying

carruthers bracing the same casino employee acosta braced earlier
college kid patch acne panic stricken stammering struggling a phone stuck to his hand i dont its just i cant reach him

the kids skittish gaze shifts locking on a figure moving through the lobby
with great relief wait he there thats one of our guys ther carruthers breaks off moving for the man in the maroon jacket heading toward the elevator
he reaches him puts a hand on his shoulder
excuse me sir
the man turns
his nametag reads bill
carruthers badges him
special agent donald carruthers
weve got a situation developing here in your hotel
acosta has fully assumed the identity of the murdered security supervisor
the pimply kid at counter eyeballs him confused
acosta steps behind carruthers blocking himself from view
how can i help you
carruthers leads him toward an awaiting elevator
i need to get to your penthouse level immediately i also need every other elevator with access to that floor evacuated and locked down
they step into the lift
is this an emergency
lets hope not
the elevator doors close behind them as we
elevator doors open to reveal the tremor brothers vibrating at varying speeds pharmaceutical stares simultaneously sharp and dull
georgia sykes stares back bad vibes trickle up her back
she holds a moment
im going down
darwin looks her over lecherous grin
he mimics a blowjob treating her like the hooker he thinks she is
sykes wants to shoot him in the face
lester and jeeves oogle her as the doors begin to close
darwin smiles wide and lewd
sykes kisses her middle finger
faggot ass redneck
darwins smile turns scowl as the elevator doors slide shut
whatd you say
some assholes on the elevator
are these bitches on a permanent smoke break or what
why the fuck they callm working girls
watters grabs her binoculars sees the four prostitutes snub cigarette butts and start to head inside
alright the ho train is exiting the station
theyre coming to you
sykes waits a beat then reaches for the call button to signal another car
we follow her finger to the up button and a blackened fingertip trembling barely enough force behind it to hold a delivery bell button down
hollis elmore hypothermia ravaged racked by seismic like seizures body temperature terminally low
the delivery door is flung open and a kid of about twelve stands there cross eyed coke bottle eyeglasses shirtless wearing a rising sun head wrap and karate gee
he says nothing
sputtering hel i ambula pleeeeee elmore collapses consciousness strains snaps he blacks out as his jaw collides with the concrete as duprees bagged corpse is hefted onto a coroners gurney
and wheeled into an awaiting ambulance
deeks body follows
the parking lot teems with local news trucks
passerbys crowd the police line
messner is on his cellphone incensed confused
a sheriffs deputy flanks him
no no clarify
what is an emergency requisition of surrounding personnel
beat listens within one hundred mile radius understood sacramento reno carson city
so in less than an hour were going to have anywhere from forty to fifty odd field agents arriving without the slightest inkling as to why theyre here
is that correct
am i misinterpreting that or listens no im not blaming any one person this is bureau directive
but agent carruthers is the sac and hes out of cell range at the moment so i cant contact him to listens frustrated very well
i need to get deputy director locke on the phone as soon as possible
one of the crime scene recovery team members approaches hands messner a printout
a faxed blown up rendering of a nevada drivers license
we recognize the face
hollis elmore resident of las vegas formerly with the p
hes a known associate of duprees
the cs team member holds an evidence bag aloft
we found these washed up on shore
messner takes the bag gawks cant quite make out the contents
what are these
whorls are in bad shape from the frostbite but we got a good pull for latents positive beat nod to bag those were shot off
then weve got a third man missing
commotion close sheriffs task force members hustling past hopping into cruisers firing their sirens
a fifty something task force chief approaches messner
weve recovered their car
a dodge stratus picked up yesterday at a commuter airport in reno nevada
suddenly panicked wheres it at now
in the parking structure of the nomad
a crime scene unit already has the area cordoned off
police photographers circle the rental car snapping pictures as uniformed units scribble license plate and vin numbers
a limo arrives the swede disembarks black valise in tow
a group of sparazza henchmen surround him spiriting him toward a nearby stairwell anxious to avoid the police
doc gill and hugo sitting in their car a little leery at the heavy police presence
hugo takes up his cellphone
doc im gonna tell em were on our way up make sure its cool up there
is there anything you need
gill shakes his head no as hugo dials
gill retrieves his own phone as he climbs out dialing moving to the trunk
into his phone quiet im going up now give me ten minutes that should be enough time to prep
he clicks off hugo is completely unaware of the call he just made
gill pops the trunk removing his medical bag
still on his phone cmon somebody answer
the phone rings beanie moves to answer it tossing his balled up versace shirt to soot vitoli
looking back thats a silk blend b six hundred and change an sgot vomit and bile and stomach contents all over it i aint gonna tellya how tget the mafucka
clean jus put it right
soot nods unfurls a laundry tote sticks the shirt inside hand moving within the bag pointing to israels soiled jacket check the mans calf skin coat too he look like
he got some cinnamon roll an shit all over it beanie turning reaching down for the ringing phone when thwap something plunks him hard from behind hes knocked forward by the force of the impact startled instinctively slapping at that area thinking something stung him
what the fuck
he looks around alarmed head on a swivel hand probing the pain not aware of the blood coursing from that spot streaming down his back
the phone continues to ring
then beanie hears the small metallic warble of something rolling around on the floor behind him gradually settling
a sensation overtakes him
and he grows very still with it
he looks down at his hand for the first time
sees blood there reaches up with that same hand and finds the tattered hole right above the base of his spine small wisps of smoke drifting up out of the
he turns numb
and sees what looks like a spent shell casing just ejected coming to rest on the tile
the phone continues to ring
his eyes track upward to vitoli the butler holding a silenced mm aim still held
and thats when it dawns on beanie
hes just been shot in the head
almost to himself aw hell no you aint just do that
three more soundless shots from the mm put a humane end to these proceedings blowing beanies body over a sofa chair
his three hundred plus pound frame slides to an unceremonious halt in the remnants of the shattered coffee table
israels calf skin coat lies near beanies dead body a pool of blood surrounding it soaking through and all the while
the phone continues to ring
ivy and israel oblivious to whats gone on fifty feet away
what did you say to mecklen
israel looks from the ringing phone to the gun in his bag no good ivy will kill him before he clears the bedspread
thats probably him now
see this is onea them rare moments when yass get a chance to be completely honest
and if im asking you what you said to mecklen assume the shit is rhetorical
so assume i already know
ivy lets that
caliber hang like intimidation itself
israel looks over at the ringing phone then back at ivy
he slowly withdraws the deck of cards from his robe pocket begins shuffling at lightspeed firing them across his body left to right right to left
a set of skills god given gifts i close my eyes
he does snatching a card cold from the deck turning it to ivy
king of clubs
you pick up this deck sjust playing cards i pick up this deck its a living breathing thing
what do you see right now
you see exactly and only what i choose to show you
thats illusion ivy
thats the lie i tell your eyes
the manipulation of movement
knowing where your gaze wants to go guiding it there
making the magic happen in that moment that split second but seeing behind it knowing its all bullshit
built on sand
cards flying crazy i can show the feds what they want to see too
and make it as real as this room
make it more than smoke more than mirrors
and thats why im valuable
and thats why youre not
beat i never wanted it this way
israel a card slipping from his sleeve into his throwing hand
ace of spades
he keeps it cupped
oh you aint done a damn thing cant be undone playa
the dye aint even close tcast
ywanna make some shit real
no stage no and lemme say this one time
locke inbound to tahoe with a detachment of d
agents accompanying him
hes examining contents from the confidential package he received earlier photos of a post op primo sparazza plastic surgery shrink wrapped his face swollen and deformed dozens of photos dozens
if you think old man primo could twist your shit up
he scans the surgical reports specific sentences and words pop maliofacial disorder degenerative bone disease bullet fragments he keeps reading
it aint nothin compared to what i bout to do here
i dont believe this
bill aka pasquale acosta hitting a walkie talkie against his leg checking for a signal faking the whole affair
batterys completely dead
carruthers behind him in the elevator checking his cellphone
forget it you wont get a signal in here
have to wait
carruthers annoyed stowing his cellphone
re wall phone cant you use the line in here to contact your people
not missing a beat no these phones are hardwired directly to maintenance
once we reach the penthouse i can call down and have the system taken off line
carruthers absent nods anxious
acosta bill back to futzing with his walkie talkie going so far as to remove the battery and thats when carruthers sees it
bills fingers flesh mottled at the tips horribly scarred over something clicks memories fire photostrobic
the briefing in d
supervisor locke pasquale acosta mercenary el estrago the plague carruthers expression goes black
when he was caught by the sas in northern ireland and imprisoned he chewed off his fingertips to the bone before he could be printed and idd by interpol
carruthers stares at those fingers backs against the wall hand moving slowly toward his waist suspicions pique
cant maintenance do that
carruthers unclips his belt holster
shut the elevators down
keeping his back turned
an emergency shut down of our entire elevated lift system
that has to be handled by my staff
carruthers gets a hand on the stock of the
on his hip
how long have you worked here
a long drawn silence
then static emits from bill acostas belt his walkie talkie was working all along
acosta spins back spring loaded blade firing from his sleeve carruthers clears his holster acosta closes the gap blade flashing passing through carruthers hand slashing tendons shearing bone hot butter
carruthers screams grip gone gun tumbling instinct kicks his good left hand hauls the
out of mid air clutches squeezes blam
acostas abdomen eats the blast burps blood carruthers a severed hand tucked under his chin held in place he extends pulls fires again ricochets clip overhead fluorescents fixtures catch strays
shatter glass filament explodes razor slivers rain down
acosta struck slumping a silver automatic appearing from his other sleeve trigger finding finger just as the last of the lights flicker and die a beat sustained just hard breathing
and fluid hitting the floor everything goes stiff the two take silent aim in the pitch black and fire simultaneously blazing away emptying their weapons into each other from inside three feet gunblasts illuminate ghoulish features muted screams covered in gore
georgia sykes concerned finger to her ear picking up something off her ifb earpiece muted gunshots static scrambled
its the sound of carruthers and acosta ending one anothers lives in the lift below
girl you hear that
watters sweeps the penthouse level with her rifle scope
are you anywhere near the penthouse
no but that definitely sounds like shots and i dont where its comin from its your ifb somebody else has got an earpiece youre picking up their signal i thought
we had secure frequency
aww girl tell me this mafucka aint goin off right now
watters hears something crackle over one of the scanners
a transmission to nomad security staff
oh fuck these fools
sykes looks up to see the elevator has reached her floor
securitys locking down the elevators
sykes looks at the elevator doors in front of her as we
the tremor brothers waiting arrival on the penthouse armed to the teeth each one tethered with an array of pistols rifles knives hatchets hacksaws the tools of their trade to
be implemented in the most godless manner imaginable
muzak drifts in over the speakers when suddenly the car lurches cables catch brake boxes shriek and the elevator car comes to abrupt stop
the brothers exchange looks as power is cut and they are plunged into darkness
an emergency recording sounds from the elevators ceiling speaker
please remain calm
elevator service has been temporarily suspended and will resume momentarily
the recording defaults into a maddening loop
then the sounds of someone unzipping a bag in the dark hands moving objects around metal clanks off metal as the bag is rummaged
a brilliant flash hot white to iridescent red as a road flare is struck showering darwin tremor with a deluge of sparks as he holds it aloft
les get at it then
lester and jeeves effortless aplomb the speed and dexterity of a seasoned pit crew
lester pulls a torque wrench from the bag pops the panel bolts on the elevators power box and strips the electrical wiring in seconds jeeves removes a gas powered generator
from their mary poppins like carry all carpet bag
he primes the pump yanks it to a sputtering start and feeds the ac lead to his brother
lester takes it locates the service override conduit and ties in
darwin admires this deft display of skill from his idiot brethren
as the elevators power cycles back on we
light switch flipped on revealing the shrunken shriveled fetal like form that is hollis elmore being carried by margie turlock part time rn full time souvenir shop owner
a substantial tank of a woman margie manhandles elmore dropping him into a lukewarm bath brimming with grey water

oh you little foxy trying to fool your nana

warren puts the ice cream sandwich in his mouth and begins hopping up and down kicking striking the wall with great disturbing ferocity
margie cackles at this

elmore struggling against imminent death watching this display with increasing dread
he scans the sink basin sees it lined with anti depressants ritalin thorazine etc warren keeps throwing hard roundhouse kicks into the wall
oh you silly sil
never mind grandmall get it
margie marches off and warren immediately rushes over to the tub placing himself directly over the inert elmore and assuming a martial arts stance
he opens his mouth to speak and the ice cream sandwich tumbles out landing in the tub
barking out bow to your opponent
warren bows before he squares up and begins methodically delivering a kata of punches and kicks
violently and expertly snapped within millimeters of elmores face
elmore helpless to raise his arms or defend himself stares in horror as the boy his glasses beginning to fog and drip with perspiration works himself into a furious lather
trying to speak pl kid st stop
elmore holds up his stump of a hand pinky wagging in pathetic plea no use warren is in a state of unhinged near animal frenzy his eyes wild a small
yet prominent erection beginning to poke through his karate gee
margie returns to the bathroom scolds her grandson
he squares up on her feigning a blow to her face
she clouts him hard backhand big flabby arms restraining him hauling him out of the bathroom
he bleats like a butchered sheep
elmore left alone stark naked shaking he turns his head gazing into the other room a newscast plays on the television a reporter lakeside via live feed
standing in the same parking lot where deeks and dupree were killed
we slowly dolly back revealing a different room
the two men slain here earlier today as authorities speculate as to the apparent disappearance of a third
the names of the victims are being withheld pending notification of family members but action seven has learned that one of the deceased identified as jack dupree rupert reed shit

to himself dialing holy shit shit shit

frozen in his hand as he watches the news
a rental vehicle registered in mr

agent messner arrives flanked by shotgun toting sheriffs deputies local cops and bureau field agents
they deploy cordoning off the scene taking control
we see hugo and doc gill ducking down hugo still has the phone to his ear
as they approach a rear stairwell with a door that reads authorized personnel only penthouse level two feds descend chaining and bolting the door

israel readies the playing card behind his back slips it between his index and middle finger ivy shakes his head
all that slight ahand you can do and you still aint never learned to lie right israel steps hard slinging the ace sidearm sailing it toward ivy surgical strike right
eye blood bursting at his browline ivy goes down in a heap
enraged ivy doubled over he drags the
cal from its holster and lets fly firing
big bore rounds rip right through the wall punching dinner plate sized holes in the plaster
israel goes to the ground as ivy bleeding blazes away soot takes cover as bullets whistle by he tucks the mm away just as the doors to the suite are
blitzed and the security team stumbles in guns drawn grouped tight in unison they assume quasi combat stances six idiots crab crawling their way across the room
soot stays prone plays scared realizes that his rubber appliance nose has come loose tries to adjust it cant has to hide his face burying it in his sleeve wiping
more make up off in the process mustache is on point pistol trained
he spots soot cowering
to soot are you hit
soot shakes his head a vigorous no as mustache and his men turn their attention to the bedroom
calling out mr

ivys trying to kill me
mustache and his men round the corner into the master bedroom
ivy down on one knee depth perception shot trying to reload bullets slipping through blood slicked fingers israel lies on the floor behind the bed breathless chest heaving frantically trying
to pull the small automatic pistol out of his overnight bag
advancing on ivy drop that gun right now
one of the bodyguards spots the body of beanie lying dead in the remnants of the coffee table
jesus he got beanie
back to mustache he shot beanie
ivy hears this lets the gun slide from his hand standing eye swollen to a bleeding slit
ivy looking past them seeing beanies lifeless body laying there
israel peers out sees the same thing
two of the bodyguards rush to beanie bending over his body checking for vitals
ivy suspended in the doorway stunned
one of the security team looks back no good
just then the phone stops ringing
looking up at ivy you just murdered beanie
ivy shocked dismayed
israel starting to see his sweetheart deal with the feds go up in smoke
he immediately mobilizes
to mustache hey

take him down the quietly use the service exit
then get back up here and well handle the rest of this

soot from the other room careful to keep his face concealed

mustache glancing over at soot seeing him nod

mustache and his men brace ivy taking advantage of his disorientation and dismay and swiftly escorting him out
they amass around the elevator taking care to double handcuff ivy now
mustache pushes the call button
it fails to light
choked with generator and road flare smoke lit like hell itself
the tremors stand at arms shrouded in a miasmic mung of horribly toxic fumes filling their lungs with it
mustache hits the call button again still nothing
yet one of the lifts appears to be ascending wait
one of em looks like its on its way up
what about the other four

he keeps hitting the call button but it wont light
the hell is going on

sykes struggling when the doors suddenly retract on their own
shes staggered by what she sees in the elevator tripping back heels catching dumping her on her ass just above whisper oh
she sits up stupefied
cordite and pistol smoke drift out of the open elevator doors like a funeral dirge
the sound of a bone saw emanates from within
carruthers and acosta
wartorn shot to hell post battle standoff just staring weapons emptied bodies bullet punctured leaking life
both are breathing but just barely
what is it
filament and glass dust cover everything
blood streams in steaming fissures floating spent shell casings and fluorescent shards cover the floor of the car
acosta clinging to life itself clutching the whirring bone saw trying in vain to reach carruthers
sykes wades forward wary glock vise gripped
girl theres these two dudes just sittin here in this elevator all shot up
beat looking around they musta been beefin big time with one another cuz this shit got way past words whatever it was

sykes glancing from carruthers to acosta
elmore seated wrapped in quilts and heated blankets shivering horribly lips blackened flexing brittle fingers on his good hand trying to restore feeling teeth clattering like ten thousand tea cups
margie turlock enters arms loaded down grandson warren hot on her heels a set of nunchukas under his arm
elmore palpable hatred pure bile for the boy
margie sets the assortment of goods down on the table in front of elmore tourist themed hats sweatsuits from the shop a pair of thermals a collection of pill bottles
and what appears to be an old vietnam era ammo box
so them fellas were your friends then
the ones that was shot and tossed into the lake

elmore nods rifling the pile in front of him going for the pills
margie pulls a pot of coffee off the stove pours a mug
sets it down in front of him
motioning to pills them was left over from my hysterectomy so theyre a few years old might be outta date
elmore eyes the labels vicodin vioxx

warren sits in the chair next to elmore and begins mimicking him shaking epileptically doing his doofus bit tucking three fingers away waving a stump belly laughing
now you go and practice your nunchucks now leave us be for a bit shug
warren scowls getting up in super slow motion making sounds with his mouth as he stands robotic whirs buzzes clicks margie chuckles at her grandson she cant help it then
in a blur warren snaps abruptly slamming the nunchakas on the table the rebounding portion of the weapon almost hitting elmore in the face
he bolts the room before grandma can scold him his titters echoing off like taunts

a padlock being locked and secured
elevators and access doors locked down indefinitely
casino and hotel patrons file out in less than orderly fashion
craps players pissed that their hot streaks have been cut short harangue police and sheriffs personnel in passing
barflys and blackjack habituates accustomed to staying in one spot for months on end have to be manually removed
the four call girls trying to argue their way past security and onto one of the elevators realizing theyre not getting anywhere near the penthouse level
messner coordinates the nomads exodus continually adjusting his earpiece trying to contact carruthers two agents flank him

as the car rises past the fourteenth floor the signal sharpens crystallizes less than a second cuz imma kill the one that aint
messner reacts the elevator arrives with a ding
mustache and his men wait for the doors to open
heavy black smoke begins to slowly seep through the cracks rolling up and along the walls unfurling finger like across the ceiling
from within the elevator car itself a pull engine sputters to a stall
a heart begins to beat over the soundtrack
a steady thrum building slowly
israel on the phone consumed by chest spasms
soot his vitoli visage now mangled beyond recognition nose sheared off rubber chin and jaw prosthesis
he throws back the tablecloth covering his service tray takes an igloo cooler off ice inside pulls surgical tools from it scalpel forceps rib spreader etc
he arranges them pre op style
he removes a phone from his jacket hits send waits says cryptically three minutes
he reaches israel leveling the mm to his skull
israel is completely unaware as he clutches his chest breath coming in great laborious gulps
hes on the phone to mecklen
buddy they revoked the deal they pulled it
the deputy director this prick locke he smashed the whole thing were done they wont tell me why
the doors to the suite open and in stride hugo and doc gill
soot gun raised watches as both men look up and meet his gaze
the heartbeat continues
hugo a guarded step forward squinting
what are you doing

israel turns back sees this demented version of vitoli aiming at gun right in his face
israels breathing suddenly cinches up tight his pulse triple timing
he turns back to gill
doc y wha what is this
hugo takes a step away from gill alarmed his hand inch worming toward the gun on his waist
we track the hand as it becomes agent messner reaching for his gun as the elevator arrives at the fourteenth floor
messner and a heavily armed contingent of cops and fellow feds exit the elevator fanning out quietly situating themselves at the far side of the hallway with a clear line
of sight to the open elevator at the opposite end
sykes having heard the elevator arrive leans against the wall gun up listening messner voice low directing the tactical action
two man cover formation far end the elevator is open possible aggression inside watch for fire sykes hearing that last transmission simultaneously
watch for fire
she glances down at carruthers sees his ifb in his lap realizes thats where the voice is coming from
plugs it into her ear
stay low breach on my mark
sykes covering carruthers ifb whispering into her own
fourteen im pinched i need some heavy shit fire from heaven
watters re targeting bringing the barrett
to bear on the lower floors sighting down from the top counting back to fourteen settling locking off the tripod gazing through her scope
heartbeat building still becoming more erratic
watters pov fourteenth floor big glass windows drawn curtains
she nuzzles the eyepiece finger slipping delicately inside the trigger guard
with sykes attention diverted acosta begins slowly moving his hand toward his pant leg reaching for a hidden ankle holster as we mustache and his men hands going to their
rigs shoulder and waist
a handcuffed ivy watches with them as the elevator doors open and a big plume of black smoke vacates the car eerily cast light burns blood red within infernal hellish
now another pull engine leaps to life from inside the car this one gnarled and guttural winding out
heartbeat jackhammering now
out of control
the sound falls away leaving only the runaway throb of the beating heart as we buddy israel
both hands going to his heart
something horribly wrong
he pitches forward falling away from soots pistol the heartbeat crescendos wildly out of control
a bell ranger helicopter the heartbeat becoming the thwack of rotor blades as it lifts off with deputy director locke and an fbi tactical team inside
a kaleidoscope of scenarios about to be played out at the exact same second
in this soundless realm the camera takes us past the following hugo looking on in horror as israel collapses
doc gill rushing to buddys aide
soot bringing the mm up leveling it on hugo
mustache sensing grave danger his gun being drawn
his en following suit
ivy pulling away from his captors looking for cover
darwin tremor stepping from the elevator strapped with sawed off pump shotgun in one hand a vintage elephant gun in the other looking for lives to end
lester tremor chainsaw snarling spewing oil psycho smile preading viral across a pockmarked face
jeeves tremor sledgehammer in a scabbard on his back olding wwii era german potato masher grenades gripped like drumsticks pins pulled
he hurls them
sykes pulling extra clips from her handbag securing them under her garter belt dumping her heels in favor of hose
acosta pant leg lifted moving panther quiet tortoise slow unfastening the snap on his ankle holster
carruthers near death eyes locked on acosta his mortal ombatant trying desperately to reach his own ankle holster
messner watching as his team moves into place around the levator
checking his own piece flicking off the safety
watters in the hotel window across the way sniper rifle nug to her shoulder eye on the scope waiting for the word
inside the earpiece at x normal magnification micro sound condensers and circuits the size of skyscrapers
then a voice makes the landscape tremble like the trump of god bring it
back out of the earpiece down through the scope over the barrel of the rifle
caliber bullet is birthed
the fourteenth floor window of the nomad detonates with concussive ferocity creating a hailstorm of shattered glass that sweeps the length of the hallway engulfing cops and feds whole
another round tears in after it exploding a gilded ceiling stanchion sparking off the rebar tripping the sprinkler system dousing the corridor everybody runs for cover
one of the agents wounded summons another elevator
messner undeterred advances on the elevator containing sykes and carruthers
sykes glock ready to rock about to move
acosta pulling a pistol from his ankle rig preparing to backshoot sykes
full blown bloodbath
heavily armed men on an overkill override
mustache and co
waging close quarters warfare with the brothers tremor
bullets blaze bodies drop everything burns soot shooting hugo several times hugo falling back confused by the abrupt pain baffled by the appearance of blood
gill overtop of israel trying to force feed him nitro glycerin tablets
buddy goes into full cardiac arrest
disparate sounds collide now swell to a great tumult an incomprehensible crescendo of explosions and chainsaws and gunshots and screams as we nothing
complete and utter silence
sitting in that hospital bed
sitting on a sofa in his suite with sparazzas men
drunk and despondent
by the phone
watching his phone
all of it happening at lightspeed
watters reloading watching as leaden contrails of gunsmoke pour from the pulverized fourteenth floor
she resumes her assault
messner a few feet from the car containing sykes
more sniper fire rakes the hallway
another elevator arrives opens
call girls inside
they snuck up somehow past security
the gunplay gets them spooked scared they scramble from the car cops and feds try to stuff them back inside the elevator as rounds continue to rain down
one of the girls catches a hard ricochet wig leaping off her head as a bounced bullet punches through her skull she crumbles instant casualty
messner hardly notices moving instead toward the other elevator car
whispering into ifb are these feds fake or for real girl
carruthers pawing feebly at her moaning trying to warn her she shrugs him off
yelling jus keep doin ydamage girl keep these mafuckas off my as bang sykes squeals spins back feels numbness spread over her legs and lower trunk knows shes been shot
panic into her ifb were out girl
acosta fires again bullet ripping through her studded bustier gouging kevlar nicking ribcage embedding into the ifb receiver on her hip ruining it
sykes falters tries to raise her gun acosta raises his aim to her head about to deliver the coup de grace messner appears now sees acosta sights him when acostas
chest explodes he slumps the gun sliding away messner swings wide on the car to reveal carruthers smoking gun trembling aim exposed ankle holster
sykes kevlar burning smashed round still hot she tries to pull her vest off finds her newly paralyzed arm uncooperative
messner advancing now keeping an eye on his partner as he moves toward the car
messner enters the elevator rushes to the doomed carruthers
messner takes his partner under the arms lugging him into the open hallway stripping off his shirt
carruthers severed hand nearly falls away from the rest of his arm
acosta spits blood from the lungs his breathing now a bog of pinched snorts and gurgles
re acosta yelling to the others two feds enter to remove acosta from the car he lets out a guttural yelp as they hoist him real pain or playing possum
impossible to tell
as his legs clear the elevator doors they slowly close on the wounded sykes
messner tries to prevent them from closing cant gazes up at the digital counter as the elevator continues its ascent to the penthouse level
sykes riding up wounded vulnerable trying to reach the control panel to stop the car
she keys her now useless ifb
into ifb girl im inside im on my way up this elevator is going to the penthouse can you hear me
baby can you hear me watters panicked pulling the barrett up off its tri pod hitting the hallway double timing to the stairwell
she has no idea that shes lost radio contact with watters
sit tight if you can hear me girl
i cant do shit for you from here
im moving down for a sightline
plaster and debris everywhere sprinklers tripped most of mustaches team shot shredded or burnt to a crisp
pieces of building and bodies either waterlogged or fully ablaze
mustache and darwin play duck and cover exchanging fire
jeeves out of grenades sledgehammer swinging crushing wall studs scattering remaining security team members
ivy sheltered having survived the opening salvos gets ahold of a gun from a chainsaw shorn former security member lester sees ivy arming himself blitzes him chainsaw snarling revved out
sending fantails of gristle and chipped bone everywhere
less than fifteen feet separate them
ivy fires shots deflected off the blades teeth seconds from getting gutted he adjusts his aim high emptying the gun into lesters chest bullets blazing haywire blowing out between lesters
shoulders stopping a hard charge cold
lester lopsided bullet dazed drools blood
ivy dumps his clip searches for another the chainsaw falls stalls
jeeves hefting the sledgehammer like a hayseed john henry looks over as his older brothers life come to an end
he reacts badly
jeeves buries the sledge in a wall takes up the chainsaw rips the pullcord resumes the charge ivy finds a clip slams it in the stock points pulls trigger stick
he falls to his back scurrying away trouble finding traction soles slipping he keeps pulling the trigger
jeeves straddles him from above raises the saw like a great wooden stake about to bring it down ivys automatic discharges
the round splits the saws gas tank spritzing fuel dousing jeeves a beat before the tank suddenly arcs exploding lighting jeeves up like a four hundred pound bonfire bouncing him
off the walls a human hindenberg fully engulfed
he flails burns howls falls
molten fat melts off his body like lard butter
darwin dismayed both brothers down
he moves on mustache dispatches him with detached efficiency snapping his neck clean
he then starts toward ivy whos trying desperately to crawl out of there
hugo crawling across the floor knees dragging over his own blood trail trying to reach israel on the ground dying
soots gun has jammed
he clears it efficiently patiently reloading the weapon as doc gill in panic mode performs full chest compressions on buddy as we messner doing the same to carruthers trying to
restart his heart
acosta lays there silently slowly bleeding out being tended to by a team of agents
in the b
cops and feds gather near the window searching for the assailant binoculars and rifle scopes strafing the horizon hotel across the way concentrating at the open window near the top
watters running up the hallway past alarmed maid service and hotel staff
she reaches the lower floor window and raises the scope to her eye searching for sykes girl where are you talk to me
how bad are you hit
she sees the feds and cops in the nomad window across the way
smoke clears her field of vision through the scope expands sharpens
georgia goddamn baby please talk to me please say somethin so and thats when she spots the call girl face obscured lying dead from a headshot in the hallway
her heart sinks
and she assumes the worst sykes is dead
she flicks to full auto and opens fire right through the glass in front of her big gas ejected shells pop from the breach like bowling pins the gathered throng
across the way in the nomad window seem to vaporize in a violent collage of heat blood and building chunks watters bucks big sobs blasting away with the barrett
sykes standing now knock kneed kevlar discarded down to a black bra and mini skirt blood dribbling over her midriff deep indentation near her sternum big yellow bruise in bloom
the bullet didnt penetrate
her elevator arrives at the penthouse level and as the doors open we darwin looming over ivy about to bring the sledge down squarely on his skull the elevator doors
open in his periphery
he looks over sees sykes standing there barely clothed wet with blood gun in her hand
sykes seeing darwin standing over ivy holding a sledgehammer recognizes him as the perv from earlier
she levels the glock stepping out of the elevator steadying herself against the wall steadying her aim on darwins head
drop that hammer
beat cocking gun and i drop this one
beat know a killer motherfucker
know they voice
know they feel
and know you bout to die by one
then the sound of an helicopter intrudes rotor thrum building steadily growing louder the floor seems to shake as the chopper approaches nervous eyes dart nobody moves
the chopper draws closer growing louder hugo still trying to crawl toward his downed boss
soot finishes him off with a flush headshot
gill frantic rapid chest compressions on israel who gags starts coughs heart back up and beating
his watery gaze moves from gill to soot who know stands overtop of him aiming the mm down at him
israel averts his eyes
the end has come
he looks over and sees his lamb skin coat lying there soaking in beanies blood ruined beyond recognition
a tear escapes his eye
soot puts the gun flush with buddys skull when suddenly the ceiling begins to tremble and shake
the sound of a helicopter filling the air
messner is losing carruthers cant revive him begins to crack hammering on his chest
its no use
he sobs something slides from his pocket
he glances down
sees that the bag containing elmores severed fingers has fallen from his pocket
doesnt remember hanging onto them
he replaces them in his pocket
looks down at his dead friend sees his severed hand also missing fingers
the absurdity of this makes messner want to cry laughing
and thats when he hears the chopper
and sees it as it rises up past their floor past the contingent of cops and feds slugging it out with watters across the street
watters ears ringing with gunfire reverb reloading salvos of return fire ripping back at her then all at once the shooting stops she pauses thinks its a ploy then slowly
peers over the window sill as the bell ranger comes into view over the nomad touching down on its narrow rooftop
the doors to the penthouse level are bashed open and the windows implode as fbi tactical agents repel in weapons drawn swarming surrounding the scene shouting commands darwin tremor drops
the sledge jackrabbits for the elevator diving in as the doors close sykes stumbling toward ivy
he sees shes injured scoops her up like a new bride she places something in his hand
acostas fake fbi credentials
ivy looks nods gets it agents approach combat crouches mp s at arms
let me see your hands
ivy flashing the i
taking care to cover the photo
this womans been shot i need to get her medical attention immediately
commotion and confusion swirl
the agent unsure searching for some confirmation cant find it dismisses them and rushes into the penthouse
sykes and ivy slip out the exit
soot disarmed handcuffed
israel propped up sweating badly seizures still hobbling his heart
gill being patted down by the agents prescription pills confiscated
soot is held at gunpoint and flex cuffed the remainder of rubber appliance pulled off his face
the agents begin to initiate an all clear over their radios
moments pass before deputy director locke enters the room he approaches soot studies him to one of the agents soot
the agent nods confirmation
locke reaches into soots coat finds his cellphone
into phone would you join us please
locke disconnects passes the phone to an underling
where are carruthers and messner
agent carruthers was killed sir as locke turns back agent messner is unaccounted for
account for him
messner bounding up the steps gun drawn hears voices coming down the stairs toward him stops checks his weapon
ivy and sykes descending the stairs
he carries her like a princess sweeping her down landing after landing
whats your name baby girl
sykes somehow shy sweet gazing up at him
ivy big smile

sykes recognizes him and in a blink has a gun under his chin

messner eyes moving from ivy to sykes
stalemate no sense pushing
he moves past them hits the stairwell exit on eighteen
ivy and sykes resume their trek down the stairs
messner bashing in from the stairwell
whip pan over to reveal the swede still accompanied by the sparazza goons arriving in the elevator at the same time
darwin on his way down rolling around on the floor of the car covering himself in congealed blood and bullet casings slicking back his hair losing the security jacket splashing
yet more blood on himself
satisfied he snatches carruthers f
credentials up off the floor
the elevator arrives at the far end
a small asian man carrying a stack of clean towels steps off and starts down the hall sees watters sees the
trained on him does an abrupt about face and disappears back inside the car
watters lowers the gun wipes tears the area around her is littered with spent
the fourteenth floor of the nomad is now empty
sirens wail in the distance
down below watters can see a bevy of law enforcement personnel streaming toward the horizon
she slowly takes the barrett off the ledge begins breaking it down glancing up at the penthouse of the nomad as we
director locke waits
messner and the swede appear in the doorway
the swede nods to all concerned and starts toward israel
doc gill acknowledges the swede
ingstrom hes had a mild cardiac episode and recurring arrhythmia ive given him ccs of nobuneatol
the swede kneels down next to israel dropping his black valise cracking it open
messner dazed dumbfounded sees locke
deputy director locke
locke approaches lays a comforting arm on messner guiding him to a chair
pointing to swede this is him
the hitman hired to kill israel
hes a doctor
difficult to explain everything now
beat toward israel and much larger issues loom
beat im sorry about carruthers
damndest thing to have to die for
the swede working on israel shaking his head somethings wrong
he stands crosses to locke silently confers
to the swede very well
to other agents take mr
israel to the roof hell be traveling with us
suddenly soot breaks from his captors sprinting for the shattered penthouse windows launching himself a swan dive out into the open air he hangs there for a moment an aesthetically
striking form like lazarus cast against a cobalt blue sky backlit by the sun from the lake below till gravity grabs pulls plummeting him toward earth sending him headlong into the vast expanse of concrete below
this startlingly event is dismissed by mutual shrugs and a collective lack of concern
messner is absolutely agog
to locke forceful what the hell what is this
agent carruthers is dead
we have to transport mr
israel to las vegas time is of the essence
the gulfstream is standing by on the jetway at tahoe international
im sorry im restricted from disclosing anymore information
return to washington
youll be debriefed in the coming days
locke says no more starts out of the penthouse with the swede dr
gill and buddy israel in tow
a bureau forensics team arrives to quietly tag and bag the dead
messner stands there absolutely agog
hives of activity
cordons and crime scene lockdowns like onion layers multiple law enforcement agencies confounded confused too many cooks too many kitchens
nobody knows who the hells in charge
local paramedics and emts cart out the wounded
coroners and m
s cart out the dead
reporters and national news outlets crowd police barricades outside competing for coverage as acosta is wheeled through the lobby hooked up to iv and oxygen looking ghastly like something exhumed
he catches the eye of the pimply casino employee and manages a wink
hes flex cuffed to the gurney and pushed against the wall for the moment as the agents move off to deal with the recent appearance of lazlo soot whose body
has been unceremoniously splattered over the parking lot
as the agents depart acosta peers down at his shackles simple plastic binding rods he smiles
a moment later the stiletto blade fires from his sleeve as darwin tremor staggering out of an open elevator blood sodden head down fbi badge held aloft for all its
playing it up free pass agents rush in hold him upright help him toward a line of awaiting ambulances outside as ivy and sykes being released from the stairwell cut
chains sliding off ivy holds up pilfered fbi creds
rampant confusion makes the moment possible
hes waved through carrying sykes looking every bit the good samaritan
sykes a mess of mascara adorned in her unmentionables looking every bit the prostitute she appears to be she spots the woman at the counter from earlier
the woman gazes back jaw agape
sykes can only shrug
if you cant beat em join em
she and ivy cross the lobby as messner
morose exiting another elevator with the sheet draped body of carruthers on a gurney
gandersen the nomad owner spots him starts over looks to unleash gets close enough to catch messners expression
sees it in his eyes
enough dead bodies for one day
messner continues moving through the lobby hears the chopper taking off as through the clear glass atrium of the nomad the bell ranger goes airborne against an impossibly clear winter
sky banking south toward las vegas
the horizon hotel across the way the fourteenth floor window
watters gear stowed seemingly indifferent about the level of law enforcement heading up her way about to launch an alamo like last stand in honor of her fallen sista
she hears commotion erupt from outside as survivors begin filing from the building
she takes up the barrett gazing through the scope looking looking looking
and shes alive and being carried by a man a big gorgeous black man that shes gazing upon with utter love and longing
a boulder sized lump takes shape in watters throat betrayed backbit tears come to fast to contain too many to control
the sensation leaving her fingers she finds herself racking the bolt on the barrett and gazing through crosshairs
taking aim on ivys head
behind her the elevator arrives an a dozen armed cops hoo rah from it hustling the length of the hall descending down on her whispering i loved you baby
a gunshot in the distance followed by shrieks darwin tremor snaps his head around at the sound moving past platoons of cops and feds now rushing that way
is out affording him easy egress
he hops the stairs up top level barracuda parked at the rear of the lot
as he approaches
darwin glances over at
hollis elmore standing there skin horribly discolored disease afflicted
he wears a hooded tourist sweatsuit ta hoe ta hoe its off to fun we go
stitched in cursive across the front
hes holding the colt python against his hip
nodding to cuda that your car
darwin a beat what to do
hillbilly acumen in overdrive
no im confiscating it
holding up badge now elmore raises the colt with his good hand advancing on darwin moving gingerly his legs not quite there
darwin tries to stay tight composed
and id advise yta lower your weapon sir
elmore keeps coming
you investigating those murders out at the lake
blanching a bit ww
three men were ambushed and shot two died and had their bodies tossed into the lake the other has severe hypothermia possible dementia and will probably be a multiple amputee
by weeks end
if he even lives that long
darwin uh oh

elmore that colt looking like a cannon this close to darwin

elmore still nodding

darwin gazes up at elmore some fraternal bond forms
that who you was here for
we both got beat out then didnt we
darwin slowly lowering the colt
yes we did
long pause then now give me your car keys
and get the fuck out of here
darwin sifting through his pockets tossing elmore the keys
lemme just grab somethin
elmore brings the colt back up
darwin hands up hold on no no no im done with all that
he reaches in pulls a joint off the dashboard forages finds matches lights up starts off
to cuda probably needs to be tuned
air filters old
plugs might be bad
heater and ac aint worked in forever
seeing elmore waver theres some good drugs in the glove box there homespun keep you smiling semi lucid at leas
beat puffing away well gods speed tya then
sorry bout all that
sway athe world though winners and losers yknow
sway its always goin be
darwin walking away taking huge hits off that joint traipsing down the steps getting stoned out of his mind
elmore considering re considering looking at that colt
oh fuck that
as he back shoots darwin with all six rounds from the python blowing holes through him
darwin goes lop sided legs failing lit joint still smoking in his mouth as dies standing only to fall like cut timber seconds later
elmore acts quickly sliding into the cuda and starting it that big block hemi roaring to life under the hood
pedestrians and passerbys drawn to the commotion at the nomad the bottleneck bogs traffic down making it impossible to move
elmore crouches low as police and emergency personnel cross in front of the car
slowly the crosswalk begins to thin and then finally clear
save a single man messner
standing right in front of the barracuda staring at the tires staring at elmore
the two lock eyes as he moves around to the drivers side reaching into his pocket elmore lifts the colt up off his lap putting his heavily bandaged hand on
then he sees messners fbi creds clipped to his belt cant tell if this ones legit
he sets the colt down on the floorboard as messner walks up pulling a plastic bag from his pocket the one containing three severed fingers
he glances down at elmores mummified left hand holding out the bag for him to take
elmore unsure accepting the bag seeing whats inside embarrassed by it he sets it down on the seat next to him
your friends were taken to carson city memorial theyre going to be autopsied and shipped back for burial
ill take care of it
who owned this car
the ones that killed em
where are they now
elmore looks up at him what does it matter
i just want to go home man
i just want to go home and forget this fucking place even exists
messner a thought then youre injured
let me drive
messner walks in cleaned up pressed suit no tie
he badges himself past the front desk
an orderly approaches
are you with the group on the third floor
turns points you can take that stairwell up the i
is at the end of the hall
messne exits the stairwell
droves of feds and justice department types crowd the third floor hallway around the i
the mood is subdued
the swede exits a per op suite dressed in scrubs and a surgical gown talking with dr
gill who is also dressed for surgery
messner searches the hall for a familiar face
locke far end talking with an aide
for a press release
officially he took his own life suicide by hanging something of that sort
basic bullet points despondent over the turn his career had taken troubles with the law history of substance abuse and so on the aide sees messner approach
locke follows her eyes turns
what are you doing here
my debrief indignant will be handled back in no we need to handle it now
locke angered handing his clipboard to the aide taking messner by the arm leading him away
you were given instructions to get on that plane and return to washington
a gun is in lockes side now against his ribs he looks down stunned
now its messner whos leading him away
youre going to tell me why no call was made to inform us that the israel situation had been altered
why i and my friend and partner whose body is going into a furnace tomorrow were not sufficiently apprised of bureau movement on this matter
locke pale shook up
i cant discuss you can and you will
and you just figured that out
jams gun into ribs the swede isnt a hitman is he
hes a surgeon
sparazza didnt want israels heart for a trophy he wanted it for a transplant
locke and messner enter
in an oxygen tent erected on one side of the room sits the shrunken figure of primo sparazza
on the other a barely conscious buddy israel
both men are hooked up to multiple i vs and heart monitors
theyre father and son
messner turns back to locke mind racing searching his memory sparking to the diner
the day before
a paternity suit filed
brought against sparazza by israels mother laverne who was nineteen at the time
they had a brief affair which israel was the by product of
messner turns back gazing at israel and sparazza
does he know
he does now
israel and sparazza glare at one another across the room with pure unadulterated hated for the other
so the wiretaps of padiche and serna the reel to reel machine spins some swede real badass supposedly a specialist dr
sven ingstrom is head of cardiology at stockholm university and the foremost heart specialist in all of europe messner
words cant begin to describe his dismay
sparazza was in failing health and looking for a donor
the son who had betrayed and burned him so thoroughly seemed a obvious choice
so all of our intel was bogus to begin with
the actual contract went to lazlo soot the man that plunged to his death from the penthouse yesterday
he was to neutralize israels entourage and prep for the removal of his heart
ingstrom was to handle the surgery itself on site with the assistance of dr
gregory gill israels personal physician who was also on the sparazza payroll
messner steps closer to locke close enough to throttle him
when did you know all this
information was arriving all day yesterday
when we finally figured out who sparazza actually was we oops slip up too much talking
locke goes silent
after a moment what do you mean who sparazza actually was
locke says nothing
messner levels his gun on him
are you insane
pulling hammer back what do you mean who sparazza actually was
locke reluctantly hands messner the confidential package we saw delivered to him earlier in the film
messner pulls the photos of a post op primo sparazza the diner carruthers and messner the day before
you realize that sparraza has had thirty six major medical procedures performed on him since
elective plastic surgery every single one it wasnt elective
it was undertaken to save his life
and it wasnt cosmetic it was reconstructive
look at the date of the first procedure
reading yeah fifty three
the same year that sparazza murdered agent freeman heller
a slow sickening realization taking hold
the past a ford fairlane flush with an embankment bullet perforated dead body draped
a top coated man stalks the vehicles sole survivor freeman heller shooting him in the back
he rolls over and is shot point blank in the face
the camera tilts up to the top coated gunman who returns the pistol to its holster revealing
an fbi badge clearly visible clipped to his waist
messner staring at sparazza
now he knows
as if to himself holy shit
back to locke isnt it
primo sparazza was hellers alias
he went deep cover in and stayed under for over ten years amassing materials against the mafia and other criminal syndicates
he may have ripped the organization wide open pre appalachia but his superiors were convinced that he had gone rogue swapped allegiances
so they gave the order to terminate his cover
freeman heller primo sparazza lying there on the turnpike unblinking blue eyes staring up dead bullet punctures issuing blood swelling consuming the facial features distorting perverting
those blue eyes blink
he survived the shooting but the injuries he sustained triggered a degenerative bone disease that required constant surgery forever altering his features
so he assumed his alias full time
the figment that was primo sparazza became flesh and blood
beat freeman heller was no more
the day before
heller was buried in agency lore messner head in his hands
the agents of that era are all dead and gone history had defaulted to fable
you can imagine the shock this sent through the corridors of power in d
hellers op predates the second world war
thats over sixty years of intel
do you know how valuable that could be
the mans a treasure trove
so you made another deal
i wouldnt go that far
but you did and have
and now people are dead
beat seething did sparazza become more valuable than israel
and did you make another deal
locke a reluctant nod
israels agreement with the government was tossed out
were now attempting to rehabilitate him to the point where a transplant can be attempted
messner glowers at locke
cant believe what hes hearing
with disgust youre trying to save sparazza
were trying to save heller
so you knew all this and yet y cutting him off we needed cohesion to move forward
while carruthers and a dozen others lie dying you debate semantics
the bureaus betrayed us
pointing to sparazza the way they betrayed him
i dont see it like that at all
messners head falls into his hands
no of course you dont
of course you dont
long reflective pause i gave all my belief and the better part of my soul to this bureau
beat looking at the wraith like sparazza look at the monsters youve made
beat profoundly sad i wont be one of them
locke swallowing hard struggling to assert his authority
ill overlook what youve done here today in light of whats taken place
youve been fully debriefed
now i want you to return to d
immediately and make no further inquiry into this matter
i mean it
tossing messner his what it lacks
is an end
locke not getting it as messner takes aim on the oxygen tent containing sparazza
lockes eyes inflate he reaches grabs gropes noooo
israel the faintest of smiles as boom
