its clearly just a case of awkward staging used to make the shot work
louie pulls his gun

what are you laughing at
louie throw him out too
come on you worm

louie shoves kevin down aisle where otto is walking out
otto takes off his clip on bow tie and tosses it back towards louie
louie twirls his gun and puts it away
note that the store aisle is lined with nothing but generic products plain black lettering on white background
all products in movie from now on will have this appearance
punks slamdancing to coup detat in the back of a warehouse
otto is there slamdancing and duke walks up the two of them swing each other around
behind them the graffiti on the wall says circle jerks a band which will appear later in the movie

otto out in the yard with miller you find one in every car
back in the desert we begin scene looking through the windshield of a police motorcycle
the windshield of the police motorcycle naturally has a pine tree air freshener hanging from it
we see some people searching around in the desert most of them in radiation suits with a local sheriff following a woman in a business suit

you know i could be manager in two years
you know kevin i had this wild fucking flippin dream the other night
it was with you and me and we were working in this sleazy shithole shabby motel down in miami florida
and we were bellhops and we were sixty five years old
it was so real it was really real realistic
and then what you woke up in a puddle cold sweat
drop dead fucking you jerk
otto stands up and starts to walk away
where you going asshole snotnose
away from you
otto gets off the edge city bus and comes home
mom and dad are watching tv edge city also the name of the films production company is a recurring theme in tom wolfes electric kool ade acid test
got anything to eat
occasionally we get a letter from a viewer that says now the only reason reverend larry comes on your television set is because he wants your money
and do you know what
i do want your money
because god wants your money
so i want you to go out and mortgage that home and sell that car and send me your money
you dont need that car
continues in background put it on a plate son youll enjoy it more
i couldnt enjoy it any more mom mmm mmm mmm this is swell
what is it son

well not too long ago but ummm
that you told me that youd give me a thousand dollars to go to europe if i finish school

same as us otto
it was a gift

otto and bud riding in buds car jazz music plays on the radio
in almost all scenes inside of buds car jazz music will be playing on the radio
in this sequence the background changes from day to night back to day and back to night again during the speed snorting scene even though the dialog seems continuous
i believe that this was done intentionally to show the passage of time but the disjointed events are cut so smoothly as to make it seem like they goofed the
its clearer in the tv version where there truly is a break between the line about speed and the actual snorting
so how much do i get paid twenty five buck a car
you dont get paid
are you kidding you work on commission thats better than getting paid
most cars you rip are worth two or three hundred dollars
fifty thousand dollar porsche german pronounciation might make ya five grand
it helps if you dress like a detective too
detectives dress kind of square
people think this guy is a cop
theyre going to think youre packing something
they dont fuck mess with you so much
am i what
only an asshole a jackass gets killed for a car
guys who make it are the guys who get into their cars at anytime
get in at three a
get up at four
thats why there aint a repo man i know that dont take speed
bud at payphone bud is talking on phone
ill call you back
hangs up flippin general telephone
bud picks up phone and dials
phone begins making a loud whining noise
bud gets sledgehammer from car and destroys phone while otto watches
when bud is done otto gets crowbar from car and beats side of phone with it while laughing
otto and bud in car in alley in the television version this entire scene takes place while watching buds car drive down a road but you can still hear the
snorting in the background
never broke into a car
never hot wired a car
i never broke into a trunk
i shall not cause harm to any vehicle nor the personal contents thereof
nor through inaction let that vehicle or the personal contents thereof come to harm
thats what i call the repo code kid
dont forget it etch it in your brain
not many people got a code to live by anymore
hey look at that
look at those assholes that over there
we see a group of people around a tow truck with a car being hooked up to it
ordinary people i hate em
what do you know
see an ordinary person spend his life avoiding tense situations
repoman spends his life getting into tense situations
lets go get a drink
otto and bud in a store bud sets six packs of drink down on the counter
tense situations kid
get into five or six of them a day and it dont mean shit zilch anymore
i mean i seen men stabbed and it didnt mean shit zilch

otto sees boxes wrapped in ribbons in back seat and hands one to lite who throws it out window
a car runs over box and we see that it is full of money
otto continues throwing boxes out of the window
you read that book i gave you
science of matter over mind
unh uhg youd better read it and quick
that book will change your life
found it in a maseratti in beverly hills
otto and miller in vacant lot under bridge a lot of people dont realize whats really going on
they view life as a bunch of unconnected incidences and things
they dont realize that theres this like lattice of coincidence that lays on top of everything
ill give you an example show you what i mean
suppose you thinking about a plate of shrimp
suddenly somebody will say like plate or shrimp or plate of shrimp out of the blue no explanation
no point in looking for one either
its all part of a cosmic unconsciousness
you eat a lot of acid miller back in the hippie days
ill give you another instance
you know the way everybodys into weirdness right now
books in all the supermarkets about bermuda triangles ufos how the mayans invented television
that kind of thing
i dont read them books
well the way i see it its exactly the same
there aint no difference between a flying saucer and a time machine
people get so hung up on specifics
they miss out on seeing the whole thing
take south america for example
in south america thousands of people go missing every year
nobody knows where they go
they just like disappear
but if you think about it for a minute you realize something
there had to be a time when there was no people
well where did all these people come from
ill tell you where
where did all these people disappear to
thats right and how did they get there
how the fuck hell do i know
which are really
yeah you got it
i think a lot about this kind of stuff
i do my best thinking on the bus
that how come i dont drive see
you dont even know how to drive
i dont want to know how
i dont want to learn
the more you drive the less intelligent you are
in buds car driving through a tunnel you know i think i saw one of those things once
one of those ufos
i mean it was really it was kind of kind of scary
i saw all these colored lights and uh sounds
i mean sounds and lights like i never heard before
i mean it was really weird
do you think all repo men follow the code
well i mean you see a lot of fucked messed up cars come in but
time out of it was the customer who fucked mucked them up

leila and otto at the united fruitcake outlet leila takes otto into a cinderblock room which has a neon sculpture on the wall and in the center of the room
standing on a pedestal is a humorous statue of what could be a humanoid type alien
you said you had something to tell me

your work is different than mine
otto takes down his pants according to the filmmakers estevez enjoyed doing this on a regular basis
maybe they were just joking

well the least you could do is give me a blow job
leila slaps otto heh i guess that means no
we have a cell meeting in two minutes time

bud and lite parked in their cars side by side see that motherfucker melonfarmer only thinks i dont know whats going on lite
as soon as i find that chevy im going indy
im going to buy myself a tow truck a couple of pitbulls and run a yard
sit around and watch everybody else do the work for a while change
lite lights up a roach
no way you can do that on twenty grand man
the hell i can as long as you have good credit and my credit is spotless
the hell i cant as long as your credit records good and mine is spotless
if i find the malibu you wont see me for dust im going to move to mendecino county raise me a bumper crop of tomato plants
bud and otto in a car credit is a sacred trust
its what our free society is founded on
you think they give a damn about their bills in russia
i said do you think they give a damn about their bills in russia
they dont pay bills in russia
its all free

chevy malibu exits car wash and pulls up to gas pumps
thats director alex cox wiping the car as it pulls away from the car wash and over to the pumps
the pumps at the gas station say pace gas
next to the pump is a campaign poster for harry pace running for city council
these posters appear elsewhere in the film
in his posters harry pace has a happy face
ill deal with you later

kevin walks over to malibu

parnell runs fingers through hair and pulls out a clump

vended food contains all the necessary nutrients for survival

parnell walks off screen and we hear puking sounds

lagarto and napoleon pull up in a car one other side of pumps
latino music plays on their car radio

lagarto gets in the malibu and both cars drive off
kevin returns from inside and sees both cars gone
two other attendants sit at a table and also look the attendant on the right is director alex cox
shot of car driving down freeway passed by several motorcycles
otto and mrs
parks in mrs
parks living room its really very simple mrs
you dont want me to take your car and i dont want to take your car

sound of motorcycles pulling up outside of house
well ive been in the hospital you see

parks son and his fellow band members enter oh how was the rehearsal son

otto fumbles nervously with his briefcase trying to close it

otto walks outside and gets in car
from outside we hear mrs
parks yelling at her son

i know what you done you all went out dancing some where

continues softly otto starts car and guns engine but now we clearly see that the rear wheels are up on jacks that it wasnt up on jacks before has been
listed as a goof and even confirmed by alex cox but i think theyre wrong
it is hard to tell in the dark but you can see the base of one of the jacks lit up by a light from the house which goes dark
as a band member runs in front of it on the other side of the car thus confirming that the car actually was up on jacks in all the scenes
band members run out of house and pull otto out of car
hey its cool
i like music too man hey otto gets beat up
one band member hits him twice over the head with a guitar making an audible kabong noise
supposedly you can hear one member saying this ones for keith moon but ive never been able to make it out
miller plettschner and otto in the lot
miller is chanting and dancing like a native american as he puts a bandage on ottos head
some people arent cut out to be repo men
