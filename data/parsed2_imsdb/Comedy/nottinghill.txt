screenplay by richard curtis title she plays through the credits
exquisite footage of anna scott the great movie star of our time an ideal the perfect star and woman her life full of glamour and sophistication and mystery
mix through to william relaxed pleasant informal
we follow him as he walks down portobello road carrying a load of bread
it is spring
of course ive seen her films and always thought she was well fabulous but you know million miles from the world i live in
which is here notting hill not a bad place to be
its a full fruit market day
theres the market on weekdays selling every fruit and vegetable known to man
a man in denims exits the tattoo studio
the tattoo parlour with a guy outside who got drunk and now cant remember why he chose i love ken
the racial hair dressers where everyone comes out looking like the cookie monster whether they like it or not
sure enough a girl exits with a huge threaded blue bouffant
then suddenly its the weekend and from break of day hundreds of stalls appears out of nowhere filling portobello road right up to notting hill gate
a frantic crowded portobello market
and thousands of people buy millions of antiques some genuine
the camera finally settles on a stall selling beautiful stained glass windows of various sizes some featuring biblical scenes and saints
and some not so genuine
and whats great is that lots of friends have ended up in this part of london thats tony architect turned chef who recently invested all the money he ever earned
in a new restaurant
shot of tony proudly setting out a board outside his restaurant the sign still being painted
he receives and approves a huge fresh salmon
so this is where i spend my days and years in this small village in the middle of a city in a house with a blue door that my wife
and i bought together
before she left me for a man who looked like harrison ford only even handsomer
we arrive outside his blue doored house just off portobello
and where i now lead a strange half life with a lodger called
the house has far too many things in it
definitely two bachelor flat
an unusual looking fellow
he has unusual hair unusual facial hair and an unusual welsh accent very white as though his flesh has never seen the sun
he wears only shorts
hey you couldnt help me with an incredibly important decision could you
this is important in comparison to lets say whether they should cancel third world debt
thats right im at last going out on a date with the great janine and i just want to be sure ive picked the right t shirt
what are the choices
wait for it
he pulls on a t shirt first theres this one
the t shirt is white with a horrible looking plastic alien coming out of it jaws open blood everywhere
it says i love blood
yes might make it hard to strike a really romantic note
he heads back up the stairs
talks as he changes
i suspect youll prefer the next one
and he re enters in a white t shirt with a large arrow pointing down to his flies saying get it here
yes she might think you dont have true love on your mind
wouldnt want that
and back up he goes okay just one more
he comes down wearing it
lots of hearts saying youre the most beautiful woman in the world
well yes thats perfect
wish me luck
spike turns and walks upstairs proudly
revealing that on the back of the t shirt also printed in big letters is written fancy a fuck
and so it was just another hopeless wednesday as i set off through the market to work little suspecting that this was the day which would change my life forever
this is work by the way my little travel book shop
a small unpretentious store
named the travel book co
which well sells travel books and to be frank with you doesnt always sell many of those
it is a small shop slightly chaotic bookshelves everywhere with little secret bits round corners with even more books
martin williams sole employee is waiting enthusiastically
he is very keen an uncrushable optimist
perhaps without cause
a few seconds later william stands gloomily behind the desk
profit from major sales push minus b
shall i go get a cappuccino
ease the pain
yes better get me a half
all i can afford
i get your logic
demi capu coming up
he salutes and bolts out the door as he does a woman walks in
we only just glimpse her
cut to william working
he looks up casually
and sees something
his reaction is hard to read
after a pause
can i help you
it is anna scott the biggest movie star in the world here in his shop
the most divine subtle beautiful woman on earth
when she speaks she is very self assured and self contained
ill just look around
she wanders over to a shelf as he watches her and picks out a quite smart coffee table book
that books really not good just in case you know browsing turned to buying
youd be wasting your money
this one though is
he picks up a book on the counter
i think the man who wrote it has actually been to turkey which helps
theres also a very amusing incident with a kebab
ill think about it
william suddenly spies something odd on the small tv monitor beside him
if you could just give me a second
her eyes follow him as he moves toward the back of the shop and approaches a man in slightly ill fitting clothes
weve got a security camera in this bit of the shop
so i saw you put that book down your trousers
the one down your trousers
i havent got a book down my trousers
right well then we have something of an impasse
i tell you what ill call the police and what can i say
if im wrong about the whole book down the trousers scenario i really apologize
okay what if i did have a book down my trousers
well ideally when i went back to the desk youd remove the cadogan guide to bali from your trousers and either wipe it and put it back or buy it
see you in a sec
he returns to his desk
in the monitor we just glimpse as does william the book coming out of the trousers and put back on the shelves
the thief drifts out towards the door
anna who has observed all this is looking at a blue book on the counter
sorry about that
no thats fine
i was going to steal one myself but now ive changed my mind
signed by the author i see
yes we couldnt stop him
if you can find an unsigned copy its worth an absolute fortune
suddenly the thief is there
can i have your autograph
whats your name
she signs his scruffy piece of paper
he tries to read it
what does it say
well thats the signature and above it says dear rufus you belong in jail
would you like my phone number
no thank you
i think i will try this one
she hands william a b
r j note and the book he said was rubbish
he talks as he handles the transaction
oh right on second thoughts maybe it wasnt that bad
actually its a sort of masterpiece really
none of those childish kebab stories you get in so many travel books these days
and ill throw in one of these for free
he drops in one of the signed books
very useful for lighting fires wrapping fish that sort of things
she looks at him with a slight smile
shes out of his life forever
william is a little dazed
seconds later martin comes back in
cappuccino as ordered
i dont think youll believe who was just in here
but williams innate natural english discretion takes over
no one no one
they set about drinking their coffees
would be exciting if someone famous did come into the shop though wouldnt it
do you know this is pretty incredible actually i once saw ringo starr
or at least i think it was ringo
it might have been that broke from fiddler on the roof toppy
thats right topol
but ringo starr doesnt look anything like topol
he was quite a long way away
so it could have been neither of them
i suppose so
its not a classic anecdotes is it
not classic no
martin shakes his head
william drains his cappuccino
right want another one
no wait lets go crazy ill have an orange juice
william sets off
william collects his juice in a coffee shop on westbourne park road
william swings out of the little shop he turns the corner of portobello road and bumps straight into anna
the orange juice in its foam cup flies
it soaks anna
here let me help
he grabs some paper napkins and starts to clean it off getting far too near her breasts in the panic of it
what are you doing
he jumps back
look i live just over the street you could get cleaned up
no thank you
i need to get my car back
i also have a phone
im confident that in five minutes we can have you spick and span and back on the street again
in the non prostitute sense obviously
in his diffident way he is confident despite her being genuinely annoyed
she turns and looks at him
so what does just over the street mean give it to me in yards
thats my house there
he doesnt lie it is eighteen yards away
she looks down
she looks up at him
she carries a few stylish bags
come on in
william runs in further its a mess
he kicks some old shoes under the stairs bins an unfinished pizza and hides a plate of breakfast in a cupboard
she enters the kitchen
its not that tidy i fear
and he guides her up the stairs after taking the bag of books from her
the bathroom is right at the top of the stairs and theres a phone on the desk up there
she heads upstairs
william is tidying up frantically
then he hears annas feet on the stairs
she walks down wearing a short sparkling black top beneath her leather jacket
with her trainers still on
he is dazzled by the sight of her
would you like a cup of tea before you go
orange juice probably not
he moves to his very empty fridge and offers its only contents
something else cold coke water some disgusting sugary drink pretending to have something to do with fruits of the forest
would you like something to nibble apricots soaked in honey quite why no one knows because it stops them tasting of apricots and makes them taste like honey and if
you wanted honey youd just buy honey instead of apricots but nevertheless there we go yours if you want them
do you always say no to everything
she looks at him deep
pause i better be going
thanks for your help
youre welcome and may i also say
it has taken a lot to get this out loud
he is not a smooth talking man
take my one chance to say it
after youve read that terrible book youre certainly not going to be coming back to the shop
he guides her towards the door
nice to meet you
surreal but nice
in a slightly awkward moment he shows her out the door
he closes the door and shakes his head in wonder
surreal but nice
what was i thinking
he shakes his head again in horror and wanders back along the corridor in silence
theres a knock on the door
he moves back casually
he opens the door
i forgot my bag
he shoots into the kitchen and picks up the forgotten shopping bag
then returns and hands it to her
here we go
they stand in that corridor in that small space
second time saying goodbye
a strange feeling of intimacy
she leans forward and she kisses him
a real sense of the strangeness of those lips those famous lips on his
i apologize for the surreal but nice comment
dont worry about it
i thought the apricot and honey business was the real lowpoint
suddenly there is a clicking of a key in the lock
oh my god
im sorry theres no excuse for him
spike walks in
spike walks past unsuspiciously and heads into the kitchen
im just going to go into the kitchen to get some food and then im going to tell you a story that will make your balls shrink to the size
and leaves them in the corridor
probably best not tell anyone about this
i mean ill tell myself sometimes but
dont worry i wont believe it
and she leaves with just a touch of williams hand
spike comes out of the kitchen eating something white out of a styrofoam container with a spoon
theres something wrong with this yogurt
its not yogurt its mayonnaise
well there you go
takes another big spoonful on for a video fest tonight
ive got some absolute classic
the lights are off
william and spike on the couch just the light from the tv playing on their faces
cut to the tv full screen
there is anna
she is in a stylish woody allen type modern romantic comedy gramercy park in black and white
annas character woody anna is walking around the gallery with her famous co star michael
they should be the perfect couple but there is tension
anna is not happy
ive got nothing to smile about
okay in about seconds im going to ask you to marry me
and after a couple of seconds wow she smiles
imagine somewhere in the world theres a man whos allowed to kiss her
yes she is fairly fabulous
the next day
william and martin quietly co existing
an annoy ing customer enters
do you have any books by dickens
no were a travel bookshop
we only sell travel books
how about that new john grisham thriller
no thats a novel too
have you got a copy of winnie the pooh
martin your customer
can i help you
william looks up
at that moment the entire window is suddenly taken up by the huge side of a bus obscuring the light and entirely covered with a portrait of anna from her
new film helix
william heads upstairs and pauses
spike coming down wearing full body scuba diving gear
the two of them fixing a cup of tea in the kitchen
just incidentally why are you wearing that
ahm combination of factors really
no clean clothes
there never will be you know unless you actually clean your clothes
and then i was like rooting around in your things and found this and i thought cool
kind of spacey
the two of them on the rooftop terrace passing the day
william is reading the bookseller
the terrace is small and the plants arent great but it overlooks london in a rather wonderful way
spike still in scuba gear goggles on
theres something wrong with the goggles though
no they were prescription so i could see all the fishes properly
you should do more of this stuff
so any messages
yeh i wrote a couple down
you want me to write down all your messages
william closes his eyes in exasperation
who were the ones you didnt write down from
ahm lets see ahm
oh no wait
there was one from your mum she said dont forget lunch and her legs hurting again
no one else
spike leans back and relaxes
though if were going for this obsessive writing down all messages thing some american girl called anna called a few days ago
william freezes then looks at spike
what did she say
well it was genuinely bizarre
she said hi its anna and then she said call me at the ritz and then gave herself a completely different name
absolutely no idea
remembering one names bad enough
william on the phone
we hear the formal man at the other end of the phone
and then intercut with him
may i help you sir
ahm look this is a very odd situation
im a friend of anna scotts and she rang me at home the day before yesterday and left a message saying shes staying with you
im sorry we dont have anyone of that name here sir
no thats right i know that
she said shes using another name but the problem is she left the message with my flatmate which was a serious mistake
william contd imagine if you will the stupidest person youve ever met are you doing that
spike happens to be in the foreground of this shot
hes read ing a newspaper
i have him in my mind
and then double it and that is the what can i say git im living with and he cannot remember
to spike what
i think she said her name was flintstone
does flintstone mean anything to you
ill put you right through sir
flintstone is indeed the magic word
oh my god
he practices how to sound
we hear her voice dont see her
caught out oh hi
its william thacker
we ahm i work in a bookshop
you played it pretty cool here waiting for three days to call
no ive never played anything cool in my entire life
spike who ill stab to death later never gave me the message
perhaps i could drop round for tea or something
yeh unfortunately things are going to be pretty busy but
okay lets give it a try
four oclock could be good
he hangs up classic
william jumps off a bus and walks toward the ritz
he carries a small bunch of roses
he approaches the lifts
at the lift he pushes the button and the doors open
as he is getting in william is joined by a young man
his name is tarquin
william pushes the button
they wait for the doors to close
the lift lands
william gets out
so does tarquin
rooms are to the left
to the right
william heads right
so does tarquin
william is puzzled
he slows down as he approaches room
so does tarquin
william spots so does tarquin
william points at the number
are you sure you
a bright well tailored american girl opens the door
hello im karen
sorry things are running a bit late
heres the thing
she hands them a very slick expensively produced press kits with the poster picture of anna for the film helix
a few seconds later they enter the main waiting room
there are a number of journalists waiting for their audience
what did you think of the film
close encounters meets jean de florette
oscar winning stuff
they both turn to william for his opinion
i didnt get down what magazines youre from
seeing it on a coffee table horse and hound
the names william whacker
i think she might be expecting me
okay take a seat
they sit down as karen goes off
youve brought her flowers
william goes for the cover up
for my grandmother
shes in a hospital nearby
thought id kill two birds with one stone
hes in trouble
do you mind me not saying its a rather distressing disease and the name of the hospital rather gives it away
saved by the bell
youve got five minutes
he is shown in through big golden doors
karen stays outside
there anna is framed in the window
i brought these but clearly
there are lots of other flowers in the room
oh no ho these are great
a fair amount of tension
these two people hardly know each other and the first and last time they met they kissed
sorry about not ringing back
the whole two names concept was totally too much for my flatmans pea sized intellect
no its a stupid privacy thing
i always choose a cartoon character last time out i was mrs
at which moment jeremy karens boss comes in
a fairly grave authoritative fifty year old pr man consulting a list
and you are from horse and hound magazine
is that so
william shrugs his shoulders
jeremy settles at a little desk in the corner and makes notes
william feels he has to act the part
they sit in chairs opposite each other
so ill just fire away shall i
the films great
and i just wondered whether you ever thought of having more
horses in it
ahm well we would have liked to but it was difficult obviously being set in space
william puts his head in his hands
he was panic
im sorry i arrived outside they thrust this thing into my hand i didnt know what to do
no its my fault i thought this would all be over by now
i just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing
i seriously dont know what got in to me
i just wanted to make sure you were fine about it
absolutely fine about it
re enter jeremy
do remember that miss scott is also keen to talk about her next project which is shooting later in the summer
oh yes excellent
ahm any horses in that one
or hounds of course
our readers are equally intrigued by both species
it takes place on a submarine
but if there were horses would you be riding them yourself or would you be getting a stunt horse person double sort of thing
im just a complete moron
this is the sort of thing that happens in dreams not in real life
good dreams obviously its a dream to see you
and what happens next in the dream
its a challenge
well i suppose in the dream dream scenario
ahm change my personality because you can do that in dreams and walk across and kiss the girl but you know itll never happen
then they move towards each other when
times up im afraid
sorry it was so short
did you get what you wanted
maybe time for one last question
jeremy goes out its their last seconds
are you busy tonight
they look at each other
jeremy enters with another journalists in tow
anna and william stand and shake hands formally
well it was nice to meet you
surreal but nice
you are horse and hounds favorite actress
you and black beauty
william exits fairly despondent and heads for the door
tarquin is in the corridor calling on his mobile phone
how was she
wait a minute she took your grandmothers flowers
william cant think his way out of this
he turns to go but is accosted by karen
if youd like to come with me we can rush you through the others
thackers from horse and hound
a forty year old actor with great presence warmly shakes williams hand
pleased to meet you
did you like the film
well fire away
ahm did you enjoy making the film
any bit in particular
well you tell me which bit you liked most and ill tell you if i enjoyed making it
ahm right right i liked the bit in space very much
did you enjoy making that bit
same room same seat minutes later with a monolingual foreign actor and an interpreter
did you identify with the character you were playing
te identicaste con el personaje que interpretabas
por que no
porque es un robot carnivoro psicopata
because he is playing a psychopathic flesh eating robot
and now william is sitting opposite an eleven year old american girl
is this your first film
no its my nd
of course it is
any favourite among the
working with leonardo
and is he your favourite italian film director
william emerges traumatized into the corridor
it is full of camera crews
and there is karen
so weary yes
have you got a moment
they knock on her door
a certain nervousness
they are alone again
that thing i was doing tonight im not doing it any more
i told them i had to spend the evening with britains premier equestrian journalist
oh well great
oh no shittity brickitty its my sisters birthday shit were meant to be having dinner
but no im sure i can get out of it
no i mean if its fine with you ill you know be your date
youll be my date at my little sisters birthday party
if thats all right
im sure its all right
my friend max is cooking and hes acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world but you know you could hide the food in your handbag or something
bella and max are in the kitchen
hes bringing a girl
miracles do happen
does the girl have a name
he wouldnt say
christ what is going on in there
the oven seems to be smoking a little
then the bell rings
max contd oh god
its bad timing
max shoots out of the kitchen
max heads for the door impatiently
he opens it and turns back without looking at william and anna standing there
come on in
vague food crisis
william and anna move along the corridor to the kitchen
bella is there
hiya sorry the guinea fowl is proving more complicated than expected
hes cooking guinea fowl
dont even ask
good lord youre the spitting image of
bella this is anna
he rises from his stove position
this is anna
hello anna ahm
he recognizes her the word just falls out scott have some wine
door bell goes
max opens the door it is honey
she does a little pose having worn a real party dress
yes happy birthday
they head back along the corridor
look your brother has brought this girl and ahm
they enter the kitchen
sees anna oh holy fuck
hun this is anna
anna this is honey shes my baby sitter
oh god this is one of those key moments in life when its possible you can be really genuinely cool and im going to fail a hundred percent
i absolutely and totally and utterly adore you and i think youre the most beautiful woman in the world and more importantly i genuinely believe and have believed for some
time now that we can be best friends
what do you think
i think that sounds you know lucky me
she hands her a present
oh my god
you gave me a present
were best friends already
marry will hes a really nice guy and then we can be sisters
ill think about it
the front door bell goes
thatll be bernie
he heads out into the corridor to the front door
max opens the door
im sorry im so late
bollocksed up at work again i fear
millions down the drain
they enter the room
bernie this is anna
delighted to meet you
doesnt recognize her turns to honey
honey bunny happy birthday to you
hands her a present its a hat
you dont have to wear it or anything
a minute or two later they are standing drinking wine before dinner
bernie with anna on their own william helping max in the kitchen
you havent slept with her have you
that is a cheap question and the answer is of course no comment
no comment means yes
no it doesnt
do you ever masturbate
definitely no comment
you see it means yes
then on to bernies conversation
so tell me anna what do you do
im an actress
im actually in the stock market so not really similar fields though i have done some amateur stuff p
wodehouse you know farce all that
ooh careful there vicar
always imagined its a pretty tough job though acting
i mean the wages are a scandal arent they
well they can be
i see friends from university clever chaps been in the business longer than you theyre scraping by on seven eight thousand a year
its no life
what sort of acting do you do
hows the pay in movies
i mean last film you did what did you get paid
fifteen million dollars
on the high side
have you tried the nuts
right i think were ready
they all move towards the kitchen
to bella i wonder if you could tell me where the
oh its just down the corridor on the right
ill show you
a moments silence as they leave then in a split second the others all turn to william
quickly quickly talk very quickly what are you doing here with anna scott
the movie star
oh goddy god
the horror of his remembered conversation slowly unfolds
honey re enters
i dont believe it
i walked into the loo with her
i was still talking when she started unbuttoning her jeans
she had to ask me to leave
a little later
they are sat at dinner
bella next to anna
what do you think of the guinea fowl
whispering im a vegetarian
moving on through the evening they are very relaxed as they eat dinner
a few seconds watching the evening going well anna is taking this in real friends relaxed easy teasing
and theres a cake
honey wears bernies unsuitable hat
anna watches william laughing at something and then putting his head in his hands with mock shame
having you here anna firmly establishes what ive long suspected that we really are the most desperate hot of under achievers
im not saying its a bad thing in fact i think its something we should take pride in
im going to give the last brownie as a prize to the saddest act here
a little pause
then william turns to bernie
well obviously its me isnt it i work in the city in a job i dont understand and everyone keeps getting promoted above me
i havent had a girlfriends since
puberty and well the long and short of it is nobody fancies me and if these cheeks get any chubbier they never will
i fancy you
or i did before you got so far
you see and unless im much mistaken your job still pays you rather a lot of money while honey here she earns nothing flogging her guts out at londons seediest
and i dont have hair ive got feathers and ive got funny goggly eyes and im attracted to cruel men and no onell ever marry me because my boosies have
actually started shrinking
you see incredibly sad
on the other hand her best friend is anna scott
thats true i cant deny it
she needs me what can i say
and most of her limbs work
whereas im stuck in its thing day and night in a house full of ramps
and to add insult to serious injury ive totally given up smoking my favourite thing and the truth is
we cant have a baby
bella shrugs her shoulders
bernie is totally grief struck
cest la vie
were lucky in lots of ways but
surely its worth a brownie
william reaches for her hand
max breaks the sombre mood
well i dont know
look at william
very unsuccessful professionally
used to be handsome now kind of squidgy around the edges and absolutely certain never to hear from anna again after shes heard that his nickname at school was floppy
they all laugh
anna smiles across at william
so i get the brownie
i think you do yes
wait a minute
what about me
you think you deserve the brownie
a shot at it
youll have to prove it
this is a great brownie and im going to fight for it
state your claim
well ive been on a diet since i was nineteen which means basically ive been hungry for a decade
ive had a sequence of not nice boyfriends one of whom hit me and every time my heart gets broken it gets splashed across the newspapers as entertainment
meantime it cost millions to get me looking like this
really and one day not long from now
while she says this quiet settles around the table
the thing is she sort of means it and is opening up to them
my looks will go theyll find out i cant act and ill become a sad middle aged woman who looks a bit like someone who was famous for a while
they all look at her
nice try gorgeous but you dont fool anyone
the mood is instantly broken
they all laugh
pathetic effort to hog the brownie
anna and william are leaving
that was such a great evening
he holds out his hand to shake
she kisses him on the cheek
he stumbles back with joy
and may i say thats a gorgeous tie
now youre lying
i told you i was bad at acting
max loves this
to bella lovely to meet you
ill wait till youve gone before i tell him youre a vegetarian
night night honey
im so sorry about the loo thing
i meant to leave but i just
look ring me if you need someone to go shopping with
i know lots of nice cheap places
not that money necessarily
gives up nice to meet you
and honey gives her a huge hug
you too from now on you are my style guru
anna and william head out
bernie tries to save some dignity
love your work
they move to the door and wave goodbye
william and anna step outside
from inside they hear a massive and hysterical scream of the friends letting out their true feelings
william is a little embarrassed
sorry they always do that when i leave the house
the house is in lansdowne road on the edge of notting hill
they walk for a moment
a bit of silence
its the hair
its to do with the hair
why is she in a wheelchair
it was an accident about eighteen months ago
and the pregnancy thing is that to do with the accident
you know im not sure
i dont think theyd tried for kids before as fate would have it
they walk in silence for a moment
would you like to come
my house is just
she smiles and shakes her head
i thought you were leaving
a little later in the walk
whats in there
they are now walking by a five foot railing with foliage behind it
all these streets round here have these mysterious communal gardens in the middle of them
theyre like little villages
lets go in
ah no thats the point theyre private villages only the people who live round the edges are allowed in
you abide by rules like that
her look makes it clear that she is waiting with interest on the answer to this
heck no other people do but not me i just do what i want
he rattles the gate then starts his climb but doesnt quite make it and falls back onto the pavement
what did you say
yes you did
no i didnt
you said whoopsidaisies
i dont think so
no one has said whoopsidaisies do they i mean unless theyre
theres no unless
no one has said whoopsidaisies for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets
here we go again
he fails and unfortunately spontaneously
they look at each other
its a disease ive got its a clinical thing
im taking pills and having injections it wont last long
she starts to climb
actually be careful anna its harder than it looks
but shes already almost over
oh no its not its easy
a few seconds later
anna jumps down into the garden
come on flops
william clambers over with terrible difficulty dusts himself off and heads towards where she stands
now seriously what in the world in this garden could make that ordeal worthwhile
she leans forward and for the firs time since the first time she kisses him
this time a proper kiss
a tiny pause
they walk around the garden
its a moonlit dream
we see the lights of the houses that surround the garden
they come across a single simple wooden bench
for june who loved this garden from joseph who always sat beside her
we cut in and see an inscription carved into the wood
she doesnt read the dates carved below june wetherby
she is slightly chocked by it
some people do spend their whole lives together
they are standing on either side of the bench looking at each other
the camera glides away from them up into the night sky leaving them alone in the garden
william in a towel rushes downstairs having just had a shower
he shoots past spike
bollocks bollocks bollocks
have you seen my glasses
no fraid not
still searching with no help from spike this happens every time i go to the cinema
average day my glasses are everywhere everywhere i look glasses
but the moment i need them they disappear
its one of lifes real cruelties
thats compared to like earthquakes in the far east or testicular cancer
oh shit is that the time
i have to go
he sprints downstairs now fully dressed
not meaning it thanks for your help on the glasses thing
sincerely youre welcome
did you find them
we move across the audience
and there is in the middle of it we see anna watching the screen and next to her william watching the film keenly through his scuba diving goggles
a very smart japanese restaurant
we see anna and william sitting near the end of their meal
so who left who
she left me
she saw through me
thats not good
weve been aware of the conversation at a nearby table now we can hear it
two slightly rowdy men
no no no
give me anna scott any day
william and anna look at each other
i didnt like that last film of hers
fast asleep from the moment the lights went down
again anna reacts
dont really care what the films are like
any film with her in it fine by me
no not my type at all really
i prefer that other one blonde sweet looking has an orgasm every time you take her out for a cup of coffee
anna mouths meg ryan
william and anna smile theyre enjoying it
drug induced i hear i believe shes actually in rehab as we speak
whatever shes so clearly up for it
annas twinkle fades
you know some girls theyre all stay away chum but anna shes absolutely gagging for it
do you know that in over fifty percent of languages the word for actress is the same as the word for prostitute
this is horrible
and anna is your definitive actress someone really filthy you can just flip over
right thats it
he gets up and goes round the corner to the men
there are in fact four of them the two meeker men gavin and harry hanging on the other guys witty words
im sorry to disturb you guys but can i help you
well yes i wish i hadnt overheard your conversation but i did and i just think you know
hes not a very convincing or frightening figure
the person youre talking about is a real person and i think she probably deserves a little bit more consideration rather than having jerks like you drooling over her
oh sod off mate
what are you her dad
anna suddenly appears at his side and whips him away without being recognized
no thats fine
i love that you tried
time was id have done the same
they walk on and then
in fact give me a second
and she walks straight back to their table
oh my god
im sorry about my friend hes very sensitive
no look im sorry
please please lets just leave it there
im sure you meant no harm and im sure it was just friendly banter and im sure you dicks are all the size of peanuts
a perfect match for the size of your brains
enjoy your meal
the tunas really good
and she walks away
gerald turns to lawrence
they are walking
i shouldnt have done that
i shouldnt have done that
no you were brilliant im rash and im stupid and what am i doing with you
i dont know im afraid
i dont know either
they have arrived at the end of the arcade
here we are
pause do you want to come up
he hoes there seem to be lots of reasons why i shouldnt
there are lots of reasons
do you want to come up
his look says yes
give me five minutes
he watches her go and stands in the street
william coming along the hotel corridor
he knocks on the door
theres something slightly awry
he doesnt notice
he kisses her gently on the cheek
to be able to do that is such a wonderful thing
pause youve got to go
because my boyfriend who i thought was in america is in fact in the next room
he is duly shocked
shes trying to be calm
who is it
jeff drifts into view behind
he is a very famous film star and looks the part well built very handsome
unshaven he has magic charm whatever he says
over a t shirt he wears a shirt which he unbuttons as he talks
how you doing
i thought you guys all wore those penguin coats
well yes usually id just changed to go home but i thought id just deal with this final call
could you do me a favour and try to get us some really cold water up here
ill see what i can do
still not sparkling
ice cold still water
unless its illegal in the uk to serve liquids below room temperature i dont want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims
no im sure itll be fine
and maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash
and he does just that
scoops up the two used plates and heads to the bin
really dont do that im sure this is not his job
is this a problem
whats your name
jeff slips him a fiver
thank you bernie
to anna hey nice surprise or nasty surprise
he kisses her
to william she hates surprises
what are you ordering
i havent decided
well dont over do it
i dont want people saying there goes that famous actor with the big fat girlfriend
he wanders off taking off his t shirt
i better leave
anna just nods
this is a fairly strange reality to be faced with
to be honest i dont realize
i dont know what to say
i think goodbye is traditional
william walks away
william walks down the arcade outside the hotel
he is stunned
william sits alone on a bus
we see him through the side window
as it drives away we see that the whole back of the bus is taken up with a huge picture of anna
he gets into his room and sits on the bed
space anna in the very hi tech environment and a serious moods fastens the last clasps on her uniform
she takes a helmet type thing and places it on her head
cut round to the coronet cinema where this film is showing
its not full
the camera moves and finds sitting on his own
we see a momentous flash of light from the screen explode reflected in his eye
william is looking out the window lost in thought
come on open up this is me spikey im in contact with some quite important spiritual vibrations
spike settles on the arm of a chair
william decides to open up a bit
theres this girl
id been getting a female vibe
speak on dear friend
shes someone i just cant someone who
self evidently cant be mine and its as if ive taken love heroin and now i cant even have it again
ive opened pandoras box
and theres trouble inside
spike nods thoughtfully
i knew a girl at school called pandora never got to see her box though
he roars with laughter
yes very helpful
only two tables are being used
william and his friends are on their first course
bernie reads an evening standard with a picture of anna and jeff at heathrow airport
you didnt know she had a boyfriend
no did you
their looks make it obvious that everyone did
bloody hell i cant believe it my whole life ruined because i dont read hello magazine
lets face facts
this was always a no go situation
annas a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods
but dont despair i think i have the solution to your problems
they all look to him for wise words
her name is tessa and she works in the contracts department
the hair i admit is unfashionable frizzy but shes as bright as a button and kisses like a nymphomaniac on death row
william is looking uneasy
a doorbell rings
max heads off to the door
we stay with william and just hear the door open and a voice come down the corridor
i got completely lost its real difficult isnt it
everythings got the word kensington in it kensington park road kensington gardens kensington bloody park gardens
they reach the kitchen
tessa is a lush girl with huge hair
tessa this is bella my wife
oh hello youre in a wheelchair
and this is william
max has told me everything about you
frightened has he
oh yes please
come on willie lets get sloshed
she turns to take the wine and william has a split second to send a message of panic to bella
she agrees its bad
max walks over to the table
honey bella william and another girl
keziah some woodcock
no thank you im a fruitarian
i dont realize that
it is left to william who has been set up here to fill the pause
and ahm whats a fruitarian exactly
we believe that fruits and vegetables have feelings so we think cooking is cruel
we only eat things that have actually fallen from the tree or bush that are in fact dead already
pause so these carrots
have been murdered yes
time for coffee and chocolates
beside william sits the final perfect girl
she is rosie quite young smartly dressed open hearted
it is just max and william and bella and her
im sorry about the lamb
no i thought it was really you know interesting
interesting means inedible
really inedible yes thats right
they all laugh
its going very well
william is with rosie by the door just about to say goodbye
maybe well meet again some time
that would be
she kisses him gently on the cheek
he opens the door she walks out
he shuts the door quietly and heads back into the living room
max and bella wait excitedly
shes perfect perfect
william makes a gentle exasperated gesture then
i think you have forgotten
he looks at them what an unusual situation you have here to find someone you actually love wholl love you the chances are
look at me not counting the american ive only loved two girls in my whole life both total disasters
thats not fair
no really one of them marries me and then leaves me quicker than you can say indiana jones and the other who seriously ought to have known better casually marries
my best friend
pause still loves you though
in a depressingly asexual way
pause i never fancied you much actually
they all roar with laughter
i mean i loved you you were terribly funny
but all that kissing my ears
oh no this is just getting worse
i am going to find myself years from now still on this couch
do you want to stay
why not all that awaits me at home is a masturbating welshman
music starts to play to take us through these silent scenes
max lifts bella off her couch and carries her upstairs
mix through william sits on the couch downstairs eyes wide open thinking
max all in his suit for the city
bella kisses him goodbye
william sees this from the kitchen
she is also dressed for work and moves back into the kitchen to pack her briefcase with law books from the kitchen table
william emerges from the house a little ruffled from a night away from home a heads off
william walks past the newsagent heading for home
we see though he doesnt a rack of tabloid papers all of which seem to have very grainy grabbed pictures of anna on their front page
headlines anna stunna its definitely her
and scott of pantartica
william is shaving
the bell goes
he heads out to answer it
william arrives at the door and opens it
there stands a dark glassed anna
can i come in
she moves inside
her hair is a mess her eyes are tired
the two of them
they were taken years ago i know it was
well i was poor and it happens a lot thats not an excuse but to make things worse it now appears someone was filming me as well
so what was a stupid photo shoot now looks like a porno film
the pictures have been solid and theyre everywhere
william shakes his head
i dont know where to go
the hotel is surrounded
this is the place
im just in london for two days but with your papers its the worse place to be
shes very shaken
these are such horrible pictures
theyre so grainy
they make me look like
dont think about it
well sort it out
now what would you like tea bath
a bath would be great
spike enters through the front door
william doesnt hear him
spike is reading newspapers with the anna pictures in it
he heads up the stairs
opens the bathroom door walks in
spike heads for the toilet undoes his zip
you must be spike
shes in the bath
spike turns in shock and sidles out of the bathroom
spike calms himself down
he then opens the bathroom door again and looks in
anna is still lying low in the bath
spike comes back out into the corridor
looks to heaven
thank you god
william and anna at the kitchen table eating toast dringking tea
im really sorry about last time
he just flew in i had no idea in fact i had no idea if hed ever fly in again
no thats fine
its not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major hollywood star
it was a thrill for me
pause how is he
i dont know
it got to the point where i couldnt remember any of the reasons i loved him
well theres a question without an interesting answer
i have thought about you
oh no no no
he doesnt think she has to talk about this
just anytime ive tried to keep things normal with anyone normal its been a disaster
i appreciate that absolutely
changing subject tactfully is that the film youre doing
yes start in l
would you like me to take you through your lines
its all talk talk talk
hand it over
im a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster
well done you
a little later
theyre in the thick of the script
message from command
would you like them to send in the hks
no turn over trss and tell them we need radar feedback before the kfts return at hundred then inform the pentagon that well be needing black star cover from ten
and dont you dare say one word about how many mistakes i made in that speech or ill pelt you with olives
very well captain ill pass that on straightaway
how many mistake did i make
cartwright wainwright whatever your name is i promised little jimmy id be home for his birthday could you get a message through that i may be a little late
and little johnny
my sons name is johnny
well get a message through to him too
the scenes over word perfect id say
what do you think
its not jane austen its not henry james but its gripping
you think i should do henry james instead
im sure youd be great in henry james
but you know this writers pretty damn good too
yes i mean you never get anyone in wings of a dove having the nerve to say inform the pentagon that we need black star cover
and i think the book is the poorer for it
anna smiles her biggest smile of the day
he is helping
anna and william
sat down at table
theres a picture hanging on the wall behind
i cant believe you have that picture on your wall
it is a poster of a chagall painting of a floating wedding couple with a goat as company
you like chagall
it feels like how being in love should be
floating through a dark blue sky
with a goat playing a violin
yes happiness wouldnt be happiness without a violin playing goat
spike enters with three pizzas
carnival calypso for the queen of notting hill pepperoni pineapple and a little more pepperoni
i dont mention that annas a vegetarian did i
pause i have some parsnip stew from last week
if i just peel the skin off itll be perfect
later in the evening
william and anna on their own
theyre sipping coffee
a few seconds of just co existing
anna looks up
youve got big feet
always have had
you know what they say about men with big feet
big feet large shoes
a few hours later eating ice cream out of the tub
the thing thats so irritating is that now im so totally fierce when it comes to nudity clauses
you actually have clauses in your contact about nudity
you may show the dent at the top of the artists buttocks but neither cheek
in the event of a stunt person being used the artist must have full consultation
you have a stunt bottom
i could have a stunt bottom yes
would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own
ths is important stuff
its one hell of a job
what do you put on your passport
profession mel gibsons bottom
actually mel does his own ass work
why wouldnt he
the ice cream or mel gibsons bottom
they are walking up the stairs and stop at the top
today has ben a good day
which under the circumstances is
well thank you
awkward pause anyway time for bed
she leans forward kisses him gently then steps into the bedroom and closes the door
william downstairs on a sofa under a duvet
pause and pause
he waits and waits the ultimate yearn
but nothing happens
william gets off the sofa decisively
sits on the side of it
then gets back in again
pause pause then
in the darkness a stair creaks
theres someone there
to himself oh my god
i wonder if i could have a little word
he drifts round the corner half naked
i dont want to interfere or anything but shes split up from her boy friend thats right isnt it
and shes in your house
and you get on very well
well isnt this perhaps a good opportunity to
slip her one
for gods sake shes in trouble get a grip
you think its the wrong moment
pause do you mind if i have a go
no youre right
ill talk to you in the morning
might be too late but okay
back to william thinking again
more footsteps on the stairs
oh please sod off
thought you were someone else
i thought you were spike
im delighted youre not
the darkness of the living room
we see anna in the shadow
a few moments later
william and anna stand in the middle of the room
he kisses her neck
then her shoulder
what a miracle it is just to be able to touch this girls skin
then he looks at her face
he is suddenly struck by who it is
and then gets over it straight away
and kisses her
the middle of the night
they are both asleep a yard apart
in sleep her arm reaches out touches his shoulder and then she wriggles across and re settles herself tenderly right next to him
he is not asleep and knows how extraordinary this all is
it still strikes me as well surreal that im allowed to see you naked
you and every person in this country
oh god yes im sorry
what is it about men and nudity
particularly breasts how can you be so interested in them
i mean theyre just breasts
every second person in the world has got them
more than that actually when you think about it
you know meatloaf has a very nice pair
theyre odd looking
theyre for milk
your mums got them
you must have seen a thousand of them whats the fuss about
pause actually i cant think really let me just have a quick look
he looks under the sheet at her breasts
no beats me
rita hayworth used to say they go to bed with gilda they wake up with me
do you feel that
who was gilda
her most famous part men went to bed with the dream and they didnt like it when they woke up with the reality do you feel that way with me
pause youre lovelier this morning than you have ever been
very touched oh
she looks at him carefully
then leaps out of bed
ill be back
william on the bed
the door opens
it is anna with a tray of toast and tea
breakfast in bed
or lunch or brunch
she heads across
she smiles and sits on the bed
can i stay a bit longer
damn i forgot the jam
the doorbell goes
you get the door ill get the jam
william heads down the corridor and opens the door
outside are hundreds of paparazzi an explosion of cameras and questions of noise and light
the press seem to fill the entire street
he comes back inside snapping the door behind him
anna is in the kitchen
she heads back the corridor with no suspicion
youre up to something
she thinks hes fooling around
she opens the door the same explosion
in a split second shes inside
oh my god
and they got a photo of you dressed like that
undressed like this yes
anna is on the phone
spike is blithely heading downstairs to the kitchen in just his underpants
morning daring ones
he does a thumbs up to william very excited about what he knows was a result
on the phone its anna
the press are here
no there are hundreds of them
my brilliant plan was not so brilliant after all
yeh i know i know
just get me out then
she hangs up damnit
she heads upstairs
i wouldnt go outside
just take my work for it
the moment william goes upstairs spike heads for the front door
from outside we see this scrawny bloke in the frame of the doorway in his grey underpants
a thousand photos
spike poses athletically
spike closes the door and wanders along to a mirror in the hall way muttering
how did i look
no bad at all
well chosen briefs id say
chicks love grey
nice firm buttocks
hes unhappy for her
shes almost dressed
how are you doing
how do you think im doing
i dont know what happened
your furry friend thought hed make a buck or two telling the papers where i was
thats not true
the entire british press just woke up this morning and thought hey i know where anna scott is
shes in that house with the blue door in notting hill
and then you go out in your goddamn underwear
dropping in i went out in my goddamn underwear too
get out spike
he does im so sorry
this is such a mess
i come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now im landed in it all over again
for gods sake ive got a boyfriend
its a difficult moment defining where they stand
as far as theyre concerned i do
and now tomorrow therell be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to timbuktu
i know i know but
just lets stay calm
you can stay calm its the perfect situation for you minimum input maximum publicity
everyone you ever bump into will know
well done you you slept with that actress weve seen the pictures
thats spectacularly unfair
who knows it may even help business
buy a boring book about egypt from the guy who screwed anna scott
she heads out
i beg you calm down
have a cup of tea
i dont want a goddamn cup of tea
i want to go home
the doorbell goes
spike check who that is
and for gods sake put some clothes on
spike leans merrily out of the window
looks like a chauffeur to me
they move from the kitchen into the corridor
and remember spike owes you an expensive dinner
or holiday depending if hes got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal
thats not true
and wait a minute
this is crazy behavior
cant we just laugh about this
seriously in the huge sweep of things this stuff doesnt matter
what hes going to say next is there are people starving in the sudan
well there are
and we dont need to go anywhere near that far
my best friend slipped she slipped down stairs cracked her back and shes in a wheelchair for the rest of her life
all im asking for is a normal amount of perspective
youre right of course youre right
its just that ive dealt with this garbage for ten years now youve had it for ten minutes
our perspectives are different
i mean todays newspapers will be lining tomorrows waste paper bins
well you know its just one day
todays papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow
you really dont get it
this story gets filed
every time anyone writes anything about me theyll dig up these photos
newspapers last forever
ill regret this forever
he takes this in
thats the end
i will do the opposite if its all right by you and always be glad you came
but youre right you probably better go
she looks at him
the doorbell goes again
she opens the door
massive noise and photos
outside are her people including karen a chauffeur two bodyguards
and then the door is shut and theyre all gone
spike and william sitting there
was it you
i suppose i might have told one or two people down the pub
he puts his head in his hands
its over now
as full sad music plays william begins to walk through notting hill
this walk takes six months
as he walks the seasons actually and magically change from summer through autumn and winter back into spring
first it is summer summer fruits and flowers a six month pregnant woman honey with another leather jacket boyfriend
as he walks on the rain starts to fall he turns up his coat collar umbrellas appear
followed by winter coats chestnuts roasting christmas trees on sale and the first hint of snow
then he comes to blenheim crescent which is startling snowscape for the hundred yard right across ladbroke grove
by the time he reaches the purple cafe the snow is melting and in a few yards it is spring again
he passes honey again arguing with her boyfriend walking away tearful
then turns past the pregnant woman now holding her three month baby
the camera holds on her
a grey day in the bookshop
martin and william
a feeling that things in there ever change
ten seconds pass
honey rushes in
spike still feeling in disgrace comes in with her but lingers in the doorway
have we got something for you
something which will make you love me so much youll want to hug me every single day for the rest of my life
the phone number of anna scotts agent in london and her agent in new york
you can ring her
you think about her all the time now you can ring her
well thanks thats great
it is great isnt it
see you tonight
hey marty sexy cardy
and she rushes out
william looks at the piece of paper folds it and then places it gently in the garbage bin
bella bangs a spoon on a wine bottle
all the friends are gathered in the restaurant
i have a little speech to make i wont stand up because i cant
exactly a year ago today this man here started the finest restaurant in london
thank you very much
unfortunately no one ever came to eat here
a tiny hiccough
and so we must face the fact that from next week we have to find somewhere near to eat
tonys brave face breaks
the dream is over
i just want to say to tony dont take it personally
the more i think about things the more i see no rhyme or reason in life no one knows why some things work out and some things dont why some
of us get lucky and some of us
yes theyre shifting the whole outfit much more towards the trading side and of course
he owns up i was total crap
theyre all rather stunned
so we go down together
a toast to bernie the worst stockbroker in the whole world
they toast him
since its an evening of announcements ive also got one ahm
ive decided to get engaged
total bewilderment from the others
ive found myself a nice slightly odd looking bloke who i know is going to make me happy for the rest of my life
special cut to bernie the shot shows he had special feelings for honey
wait a minute im your brother and i dont know anything about this
is it someone we know
i will keep you informed
as she sits down honey leans towards spike and whispers
by the way its you
what do you think
any more announcements
yes i feel i must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months
i have as you know been slightly down in the mouth
theres an understatement
there are dead people on better form
but i wish to make it clear ive turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy
two hours later
theyve had a very good time
theres been a chocolate cake
lots of alcohol
tony is playing blue moon on the piano and bernie joins him singing
at one table bella and honey sit beer and wine on the table
im really horribly drunk
elsewhere max an william are relaxed together
so youve laid the ghost
i believe i have
dont give a damn about the famous girl
no dont think i do
which means you wont be distracted by the fact that shes back in london grasping her oscar and to be found filming most days on hampstead heath
he puts down a copy of the evening standard with a picture of anna on its cover
immediate gloom oh god no
so not over her in fact
cut to the wide sweep of hampstead heath
william entirely alone
he marches up a hill
goes over the crest of it and sees a huge film crew and hundreds of extras in front of the radiant white of kenwood house with its lawn and its
now closer to the house william approaches a barrier where he is himself approached
can i help you
yes i was looking for anna scott
does she know youre coming
im afraid i cant really let you through then sir
i mean i am a friend im not a lunatic but no you basically
cant let you through
at that moment thirty yards away william sees trailer door open
out of it comes anna looking extraordinary in a velvet dress full beautiful make up rich extravagant hair
she has a necessary cluster of people about her
hair make up costume and the third assistant who has collected her
she walks a few yards and then casually turns her head
and sees him
her face registers not jut surprise certainly not a simple smile
his being there is a complicated thing
cut back to him
he does a small wave
she pauses as the whole paraphernalia of the upcoming scene passes between them
the movie divides them
but then she begins to walk through it and followed by her cluster she makes her way towards him
when she reaches him the security guard stands back a pace and her people hold back
she doesnt really know what to say
this is certainly
i only found out you were here yesterday
i was going to ring
i didnt think youd want to
the third assistant is under pressure
she looks around
the poor third is nervous and the first is approaching
to william its not going very well and its our last day
absolutely youre clearly very busy
there are things to say
drink tea theres lots of tea
she is swept away four people touching her hair and costume
come and have a look
as they make towards the set
are you a fan of henry james
this is henry james film
a complicated shot is about to happen with waves of extras and a huge moving crane
they end up next to the sound desk
this is harry hell give you a pair of headphones so you can hear the dialogue
harry the sound man is a pleasant fifty year old balding fellow
he hands him the headphones
here we go
the volume control is on the side
william the headphones on surveys the scene the cluster is a full yards from the action to allow a gracious sweeping wide shot
he watches anna
she is with her co star in the henry james film lets call him james
we are living in cloudcuckooland well never get this done today
we have to
ive got to be in new york on thursday
oh stop showing off
he studies an actress a few yards to the left
god thats an enormous arse
im not listening
no but seriously its not fair so many tragic young teenagers with anorexia and that girl has an arse she could perfectly well share round with at least ten other
women and still be beg bottomed
i said im not listening and i think looking at something that firm you and your droopy little excuse for an arse would be well advised to keep quiet
back by the desk william is listening and laughs
thats his girl
so i ask you when youre going to tell everyone and you say
tomorrow will be soon enough
and then i
who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up
guy from the past
i dont know what hes doing here
bit of an awkward situation
cut back to william he has heard
he takes off the headphones and puts them gently down
william walks away
the moment of hope is gone
he couldnt have had a clear reminder
william is emptying anna scott videos into a box
whats going on
im going to throw out these old videos
you cant bin these
im not allowing this
right lets talk about rent
let me help
we dont want all this shit cluttering up our lives
the next day
william is hard at work doing the accounts in a dark small room with files in it
martin pops his head in
i have to disturb you when youre cooking the books but theres a delivery
martin cant you just deal with this yourself
but its not for the shop
its for you
tell me would i have to pay a wet rag as much as i pay you
they head out martin behind him incomprehensively rubbing his hands hes in a very good mood
william enters and there stands anna in a simple blue skirt and top
yes im sorry i had to leave
i didnt want to disturb you
how have you been
everything much the same
when they change the law spike and i will marry immediately
ive watched in wonder
awards glory oh no
its all nonsense believe me
i had no idea how much nonsense it all was but nonsense it all is
shes nervous well yesterday was our last day filming and so im just off but i brought you this from home and
its quite a big wrapped parcel flat foot by foot leaning against a bookshelf
i thought id give it to you
no dont open it yet ill be embarrassed
okay well thank you
i dont know what its for
but thank you anyway
i actually had it in my apartment in new york and just thought youd
but when it came to it i didnt know how to call you
having behaved so
so its been just sitting in the hotel
you came so i figured
the thing is
the thing is whats the thing
then the door pings
in walks the annoying customer mr
dont even think about it
go away immediately
smith is taken aback and therefore completely obedient
and he leaves
you were saying
the thing is
i have to go away today but i wondered if i didnt whether you might let me see you a bit
or a lot maybe
see if you could
like me again
pause as william takes this in
that actor asked you who i was
and you just dismissed me out of hand
i heard you had a microphone
i had headphones
you expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in england
martin edges up
excuse me its your mother on the phone
can you tell her ill ring her back
i actually tried that tack but she said you said that before and its been twenty four hours and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish
okay perfect timing as ever hold the fort for a second will you martin
martin is left with anna
can i just say i thought ghost was a wonderful film
is that right
ive always wondered what patrick swayze is like in real life
i cant say i know patrick all that well
he wasnt friendly during the filming
well no im sure he was friendly to demi moore who acted with him in ghost
shes kind in here not sarcastic
always been a bit of an ass
william returns a little uneasy
its lovely to meet you
im a great fan of yours
and demis of course
martin leaves them
sorry about that
theres always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict
shes awaiting an answer
look im a fairly level headed bloke
not often in and out of love
he cant really express what he feels
can i just say no to your kind request and leave it at that
yes thats fine
be getting along then
nice to see you
the truth is
he feels he must explain
with you im in real danger
it took like a perfect situation apart from that foul temper of yours but my relatively inexperienced heart would i fear not recover if i was once again cast aside
which i would absolutely expect to be
there are too many pictures of you everywhere too many films
youd go and id be
well buggered basically
pause that reality is a real no isnt it
i live in notting hill
you live in beverly hills
everyone in the world knows who you are
my mother has trouble remembering my name
the fame thing isnt really real you know
dont forget im also just a girl
standing in front of a boy
asking him to love her
she kisses him on the cheek
then turns and leaves
the restaurant is in the middle of being deconstructed
the pictures are gone off the walls a kettle on a long extension lead is on the bare table behind
theyre all sitting there
what do you think
good move when all is said and done shes nothing special
i saw her taking her pants off and i definitely glimpsed some cellulite down there
all actresses are mad as snakes
tony what do you think
never met her never want to
never trust a vegetarian
i was called and i came
william has just turned down anna scott
you daft prick
bella is casually looking at the painting that sits beside william
it is the original of the chagall the poster of which was on his wall
this painting isnt the original is it
yes i think that one may be
but she said she wanted to go out with you
yes sort of
well you know anybody saying they want to go out with you is
it was sort of sweet actually i mean i know shes an actress and all that so she can deliver a line but she said that she might be as
famous as can be but also
that she was just a girl standing in front of a boy asking him to love her
they take in the line
it totally reverses their attitudes
oh sod a dog
ive made the wrong decision havent i
they look at him
spike does a big nod
max how fast is your car
maxs car arrives in the street outside
they pile into the car
if anyone gets in our way we have small nuclear devices
and we intend to use them
shes not coming
bernie in the back
he shoots out of his door rushes round and grabs bella out of the chair
come on babe
maxs car is shooting up stanley crescent
we are inside and outside the car
where are you going
down kensington church street then knightsbridge then hyde park corner
go along bayswater
thats right then park lane
or you could go right down to cromwell road and left
suddenly the car slams to a halt
stop right there
i will decide the route
james bond never has to put up with this sort of shit
the car turns illegally right across piccadilly the wrong way down a one way street and ends up outside the ritz
william sprints into the hotel
bloody hell this is fun
is miss scott staying here
it is the same man
how about miss flintstone
or i dont know beavis or butthead
man shakes his head
he turns despondent and takes two steps when the ritz man stops him in his tracks
there was a miss pocahontas in room but she checked out an hour ago
i believe shes holding a press conference at the savoy before flying to america
william is very grateful
he kisses the ritz man
bernies also gratuful
he kisses him too
we have lift off
a japanese guest assumes this is the way to behave and the ritz man gets kissed a third time
the car speeds through london
it gets totally stuck at a junction where no one will let them in
bugger this for a bunch of bananas
he gets out of the car and boldly stops the traffic coming in the opposite direction
our car shoots past him
they leave him behind
honey leans out the window and shouts
youre my hero
spike waves wildly he loses concentration and is very nearly hit by a car
they pull to a stop
william leaps out
william rushes up to the main desk
excuse me wheres the press conference
are you an accredited member of the press
he flashes a card
thats a blockbuster video membership card sir
i work for their in house magazine
mimes quotation marks movies are our business
im sorry sir
honey shoots into shot pushing bellas chair
hes with me
and you are
writing an article about how london hotels treat people in wheelchairs
of course madam
its in the lancaster room
im afraid youre very late
to william run
william runs searching
at last finds the room and enters
huge room full of press
row after row of journalists cameras at the front tv cameras at the back
anna clearly gives press conferences very rarely because this one is positively presidential
she sits at a table at the end of the room beside karen on her other side is jeremy the pr boss firmly marshalling the questions
how much longer are you staying in the uk then
no time at all
i fly out tonight
shes in a slightly melancholic and therefore honest mood
which is why we have to round it up now
he points at a journalist he knows
is your decision to take a year off anything to do with the rumours about jeff and his present leading lady
do you believe the rumours
its really not my business any more
though i will say from my experience that rumours about jeff
do tend to be true
they love that answer and all scribble in their note books
next question comes from someone straight right next to william
last time you were here there were some fairly graphic photographs of you and a young english guy so what happened there
he was just a friend i think were still friends
yes the gentleman in the pink shirt
he is pointing straight at william who has his hand up
yes miss scott are there any circumstances in which you two might be more than just friends
anna sees who it is asking
i hoped there might be but no im assured there arent
and what would you say
no its just one question per person
no let him
you were saying
yes i just wondered whether if it turned out that this
to william his name is thacker
i just wondered if mr
thacker realized hed been a daft prick and got down on his knees and begged you to reconsider whether you would
we cut to max bella bernie and honey all watching
then back to anna
yes im pretty sure i would
thats very good news
the readers of horse and hound will be absolutely delighted
anna whispers something to jeremy
dominic if youd like to ask your question again
yes anna how long are you intending to stay here in britain
anna looks up at william
they both smile suddenly the press gets whats going on music noise they all turn and flash flash flash photos of william
max and bella kiss
bernie kisses a total stranger
spike finally makes it hes bright red from running
it was good
honey hugs him
its a new experience for spike
cut to williams face flash after flash still looking at anna
they are both smiling
anna and william at their wedding they kiss and walk into the crowd
honey a bridesmaid in peach satin she is surrounded by at least four other bridesmaids all under five
nearby tony standing glowing beside his fabulous pyramidical wedding cake
williams mother is not quite happy with how hes looking
she tries to brush his hair
max dressed in the most devastating bond like white tuxedo is dancing with anna thrilled
he does a rather flashy little move
cut to bella who is watching and laughing
martin in an awkward tweed suit is jiggling to the beat of a song entirely happy in the corner
a huge premier screaming crowds anna and william get out of the car she holding his hand looking ultimately gorgeous he in a black tie that doesnt quite fit
a pretty green communal garden
children are playing watched by mothers one of whom holds a new baby in a papoose
a very old couple wander along slowly
a small tai chi group moves mysteriously
and as the camera glides it passes a couple sitting on a single simple wooden bench overlooking the garden
he is reading she is just looking out totally relaxed holding his hand pregnant
it is william and anna
