heathers early by daniel waters an original screenplay by daniel waters registered wgaw november veronica sawyer a sullen seventeen year old beauty is jogging down a suburban street in a
stylish running outfit
evocative female voices can be heard softly wailing
veronica lurches into a neighborhood park running with an increasing sense of desperation
the female voices wail louder
veronica whooshes past a series of shops and a movie theatre
reveling in her own sweat and agony veronica bounds onto the lawn of her impressive upper middle class home
she painfully rushes closer and closer to the front door as the female moans swell to a deafening summit
the evocative wailing cuts off as she grabs the doorknob
veronica zips into a chic but understated ensemble as she launches into voice over narration
heather told me she teaches people real life
composed and unsweaty veronica fingers her bangs in the mirror then rambles off
continuing her narration veronica glides through a bustling high school hallway with a frozen smile
she said real life sucks losers dry
if you want to fuck with the eagles you have to learn to fly
with her back turned to the viewer veronica stands at the outskirts of the cafeteria entrance
the viewers viewpoint approaches and finally curls around veronica to reveal that she is writing in a diary wearing a monocle
i said so you teach people how to spread their wings and fly
she said yes
veronicas pen sways across the diary page forming the words echoed by her voice over
i said youre beautiful
a sudden off screen bark from heather mcnamara causes the pen to recklessly rocket across the written words
god come on veronica
veronica coolly pops the monocle from her eye before angrily addressing the amusingly robust conventionally beautiful trendily coiffed heather mcnamara
whats your damage heather
you ruined my
god im so sure
dont blame me blame heather
she told me to haul your ass into the caf pronto
back me up heather
from behind heather mcnamara emerges a similarly trendily accessorized but noticeably more inhibited waif heather duke
she is clutching a tattered copy of the catcher in the rye
yeah she really wants to talk to you
okay im going im going
veronica flanked by heather mcnamara and heather duke strides into the lunchroom pandemonium
the stunning heather chandler turns from the tray before her toward her incoming comrades
she is dressed stylishly and expensively but not trendily her hair dramatically tied back
submissively hello heather
pulling out a crumpled piece of yellow paper heather chandler smiles
the content of what heather says is consistently offensive but the tone in which she speaks is sexy dangerous and mysterious
she is a mythic bitch
got a paper of kurt kellys
i need you to forge a hot and horny but realistically low key note in kurts handwriting and well slip it into martha dumptrucks lunch tray
i dont have anything against martha dunnstock
you dont have anything for her either
come on itll be very
the notell give her shower nozzle masturbation material for weeks
ill think about it
looking off dont think
unattractive and quite overweight martha dunnstock dumptruck guiltily plops two jellos on her tray and clunks forward in line
veronicas arm seemingly involuntary latches onto the outstretched pen
veronica needs something to write on
heather bend over
both heather mcnamara and heather duke bend over
heather chandler violently laughs
two assholes no waiting
heather mcnamara and heather duke stand erect embarrassed
heather duke back down
veronica scurries to the contorting heather duke
dear martha youre so sweet
the traditionally handsome kurt kelly the serene black earl frazier and the massive ram sit with other stereotypical jocks taking in veronica and the heathers
itd be so righteous to be in a veronica sawyer heather chandler sandwich
punch it in ram
kurt and ram raise their right arms and slam their fists together
i wanna set a heather on my johnson and just start spinning her like a fucking pinwheel
ram makes a frantic spinning motion
earl is bored
damn right right
in slow motion veronica finishes the note and rises up along with her makeshift desk heather duke
heather mcnamara hawkishly gazes toward the cafeteria line
veronica hands the note to an impressed heather chandler
martha dunnstock dumptruck pays the cashier and then grasping her lunch tray with both paws moves toward veronica and the heathers
heather mcnamara excitedly tugs on heather chandlers arm as martha approaches
with a tranquil smile heather chandler passes the note to her frantic disciple
in a self consciously clandestine manner heather mcnamara saunters past martha then wields around to sneakily tuck the note onto marthas tray
the slow motion concludes as their plump victim shuffles past a magnetic preppie peter dawson and a thin black bespectacled dennis
the guys are working a large stand which has a cashbox reading the famine fund and a banner reading westerburg feeds the world
come on people lets give that leftover lunch money to people without lunches
those tater tots you threw away today are a delicacy in africa
theyre thanksgiving dinner
the girls reach their table with heather mcnamara and heather duke sitting themselves down first
looking to the stand god arent they fed yet
do they even have thanksgiving in africa
low key sarcasm oh sure pilgrims indians tater tots its a real party continent
heather chandler draws up a clipboard
guess what today is
the lunchtime poll
so whats the question
yeah so whats the question
god damn heather you were with me in study hall when i thought of it
such a pillowcase
hurt i forgot
veronica and heather chandler briskly bop away from the table as a wounded heather duke retreats to the catcher in the rye
hey this question wouldnt be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last
shut up it is
i told dennis if he gave me another topic that was political id spew burrito chunks
veronica shakes her head and looks off
shes suddenly captured by the sight of a james deanesque guy sitting stark in a long tan gunslinger coat behind a rebel without a cause lunchbox
they make eye contact
transfixed veronica crashes into seated betty finn a slightly overweight unstylishly dressed sweetie surrounded by clones
veronica crouches down embarrassed and rueful
im really sorry i couldnt make it to your birthday party last month
your mom said you had a big date
heck id probably skip my own birthday party for a date
veronica gently laughs at bettys innocent awe
dont say that
oh ronnie you have to look at what i dug up the other day
betty pulls from her purse a picture showing a young betty finn and veronica sawyer arm in arm dressed in halloween costumes betty is an angel veronica is a witch
veronica glows at the photo until heather chandler tows veronica away causing the picture to fall face up on the floor
i was talking with someone
color me impressed
i thought you grew out of betty finn
a coolly coed cabal of country club kids icily eye the approaching veronica and heather chandler
country club kid coutrney sourly speaks out
here comes heather
alone at a table in the siberia of the cafeteria martha finishes a forkful of chicken
she spears her plate again and brings the fork up
the note is wedged inside it
heather chandler veronica in tow hits the country club kids with a salvo of false pleasantness capped by a scowling smile
love your blouse
ooh let me snare a tater
courtney express elation in spite of yourself as heather chandler delicately takes a tot and turns around to face veronica
heather chandler inserts her finger in her mouth doing the induce vomiting signal before devouring the tot and turning back around
i just got it last night at the limited
totally blew my allowance
heather chandler raises her clipboard
veronica closes her eyes and shakes her head with a half smile
thats pretty very
now check this out
you win five million dollars from publishers clearing house but on the same day ed mcmahon gives you the check aliens land on earth and say theyre going to blow
up the world in two days
what would you do
a stunned tableau until country club kid keith speaks
id just slide that wad over to my father
hes like one of the top brokers in the state wake up
in two days earths going up like a roman candle
crab nebula city
man in two days my dad could double my money
if i got that money id give it all to the poor
peter reaches into the famine fund box and takes some bills
dennis my man run over to mickey d
s and get me a big mac and some fries
but thats the famine fund money
hey even bob geldofs got to eat
if it makes you feel better bag the fries and nab yourself an apple pie
heather chandler drags veronica down a cafeteria lane
if youre going to openly be a bitch
submissive im sorry its just why cant we talk to different kinds of people
fuck me gently with a chainsaw
do i look like mother theresa
if i did i probably wouldnt mind talking to the geek squad
she points to a table of unfashionably dressed and coiffed students
some wear glasses some wear braces some wear both
the geeks react to being pointed at
their boney leader rodney splatters milk over himself
did you see that
heather number one looked right at us
it must be love
veronica confronts heather chandler
doesnt it bother you that everyone in the school thinks youre a pirahna
like i give a shit
they all want me as a friend or a fuck
im worshipped at westerburg and im only a junior
pretend youre a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims
giving in whatever
i dont believe this
were going to a party at remington university tonight and were brushing up our conversation skills with the scum of the school
her sweaty lips moving rapidly martha anxiously reads the note
the nervous geeks fidget and roughhouse each other in an involuntarily immature reaction to their beautiful interviewers
no seriously id probably go to the pyrimads
with a girl
where you going to get a girl stud
taking a hooker to the pyramids on the last day of mankind
you sentimental old fart
geez forget it
what about you rodney
quietly to the others i told you she knew my name
beat of contemplation id change my life
blowing all your cash on two days of trying to be hip
veronica tugs heather chandler away from the table
if youre going to openly be a bitch
veronica again catches sight of the james deanesque guy
he wraps his fingers around an egg and unfolds them back
the egg is gone
veronica smiles back
her trance is broken by a boisterous heather mcnamara and heather duke who careen into the two pollsters
god scan on martha dumptruck
martha looks up from the note to the jocks table and kurt kelly then flustered back down at the note
this is the part i hate
id say were like twenty minutes from major humiliation
come on veronica
heather chandler floats off
a disturbed veronica takes a moment to react
veronica follows the leader
she calls out
veronica and heather chandler march into the school parking lot toward four heavy metalers one female hanging out on a car hood
the girls conversation is heard in voice over
deep down all teenagers are the same
didnt you see the breakfast club
veronica and heather chandler set themselves down with betty finn and her look alike friends
look at me
i look great
im the girl in the commercials and the videos
veronica and heather chandler warily stand at the outskirts of the jocks bastion of vulgarity
im the blonde in the bikini on the horse holding a pepsi can
in a dark smoky hallway veronica and heather chandler cough toward a batch of stoners in tattered forms of dress
im the princess being spanked on the throne by billy idols guitarists guitar
veronica and heather chandler click click across the school library floor to where an all out nerd studies in solitude
what do i get out of being friends with losers
i give them a piece of a winner and they stain me with loserness
heavy metaler matt grins
you get five million dollars but some martians are going to zap you in two days
you hear that clyde
thats got to be the most spooky ass question ive ever heard
betty finn daintily peeps up
i think we should use the money for an end of the world get together
we could invite guys ram sputters out some chicken to bellow
id pay madonna one million dollars to ride my face like the kentucky derby
she should be paying me though
a female stoner in army jacket starts to speak then stops
the all out nerd lashes out
this is important
with taxes id be only getting
heavy metaler clyde turns from his friend matt
if you want a good way to go out before the aliens land get a lion from the zoo
put a remote control bomb up its butt
when the lion starts tearing you up press the bomb button
you and the lion die like as one
two heavy metal lovers jackie and steve intertwined against the windshield blankly respond
veronica and heather chandler continue their conversation chugging through another busy cafeteria lane
just imagine somebody like your quasi fat goody good friend betty finn doing a crest commercial
no one would buy crest
dont tell me
crest would be stained with loserness
yeah and who wants that on their teeth
heather mcnamara and heather duke burst back between them
oh god here we go
martha with awkward apprehension stumbles toward kurt and the jocks
veronica and the heathers stop breathing
martha mumbles something unintelligible from where the girls stand
kurts head detonates with a terrifying cackle
martha flees the cafeteria in horror
veronica spins away from her mirthful friends in disgust and makes eye contact with the similarly disturbed james deanesque guy
veronica lurches away
she brakes against the foodless fund stand where peter dawson is hollering away
a dime increases the time
a buck brings good luck
a five keeps the neighborhood alive
a ten and you die without sen
heather chandler wings a twenty dollar bill into the cashbox
to veronica you wanted to become a member of the most powerful clique in the school
if i wasnt already the head of it id want the same thing
what are you oozing about
that episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy but youre determined to ruin my day
slapping her knee we made a girl want to consider suicide
what a scream
what a jest
come on you jerk
you know you used to have a sense of humor
combing their hair in the bathroom mirror the heathers speak in comically whining and pathetic imitations of martha dumptruck as veronica shakes her head with a half smile
ku urt lets pa arty
ku urt i ne ed an orgasm
heather dukes gentle off screen voice slices in
veronica could you come back here
a true friends work is never done
veronica reveals her right index finger is cut noticeably short then walks over to the stalls
grow up heather
color me nauseous
veronica stands in a tight stall with an ashamed heather duke
maybe you should see a doctor
come on heather
we want another look at todays lunch
geez dont listen to them
did she have the pie or the ice cream for dessert
like a game show host and the answer is heather duke holds up her copy of the catcher in the rye and makes a bizarrely defiant smile
yeah you know holden caulfield in the catcher in the rye wouldnt put up with their bogus nonsense
well you better move holden out of the way or hes going to get spewed
heather duke puts down her book and opens her mouth
veronica sticks her finger in
a gnarly melange of chicken and potatoes is scraped off a plate into a cafeteria trashcan as veronica and the heathers stroll by outside
veronica pauses to peer in at the james deanesque guy
god veronica drool much
his names jason dean
hes in my american history
give me the clipboard
as veronica walks off heather mcnamara oinks out some amusing sexual noises
veronica saunters to jason dean
hello jason dean
greetings and salutations
call me j
are you a heather
no a veronica
this may seem like a stupid question
there are no stupid questions
if you inherit five million dollars the same day aliens tell the earth theyre blowing us up in two days what would you do
suavely thats the stupidest question ive ever heard
the jocks witness veronica and j
who does that new kid think he is with that coat
veronica is into his act
lets kick his ass
shit were seniors ram
too old for that crap
lets give him a scare though
an intrigued j
laconically answers the question
probably just row on out to the middle of a lake
bring along my sax some tequila and some bach
heather chandler breaks veronicas daze of admiration
veronica to j
kurt and ram move into the exiting veronicas place
ram sticks his finger through a piece of pie on j
you going to eat this
what did your boyfriend say when you told him you were moving to sherwood ohio
answer him dick
hey ram doesnt this cafeteria have a no fags allowed rule
it seems to have an open door policy for assholes though doesnt it
what did you say dickweed
ill repeat myself
gracefully stands reaches into his coat and pulls out a a
he fires twice at the viewer
croquet wickets have been set up in standard form
veronica and the heathers stand at various positions in the yard holding different colored mallets next to matching balls
heather chandler knocks her ball through the middle wicket
god they wont expell him
theyll just suspend him for a week or something
he used a real gun
they should throw his ass in jail
he used blanks
really did was ruin two pairs of pants
maybe not even that
giggling can you bleach out urine stains
heather chandler knocks her red ball into heather dukes green one
you seem pretty amused
i thought you were giving up on high school guys
never say never
what are you going to do heather
take the two shots or send me out
the girls look to the doelike heather duke with incredulous faces
did you have a brain tumor for breakfast
first you ask if you can be red knowing that im always red
heather chandler places her foot on her red ball
she swings her mallet down hard on the red ball sending the adjacent green one rocketing into a flower bed
heather chandlers next shot falls short of the next wicket
to heather duke damn
its your turn heather
no its heathers turn
heather mcnamara hits her ball through a wicket and squeals
anyway i can say never to high school
ive got david
maybe when you hit maturity youll understand the diff between a remington university man like david and a westerburg boy like ram wham bam thank you maam sweeney
heather mcnamara misses her next shot
yo heather youre up
heather duke tries to navigate a shot from the flower bed
no way no day
give it up girl
as her friends howl heather duke slams her ball out of the flower bed
the ball bounces off a tree and amazingly goes through a wicket
heather duke squeals in delight
holy shit god that was unbelievable
heather dukes next shot falls short of the next wicket
veronica begins setting up her shot
so tonights the night
are you two excited
im giving veronica her shot
her first remington party
blow it tonight girl and its keggers with kids all next year
missing her shot crap
so whos this brad guy ive been set up with
witty and urbane pre lawyer or albino accountant
david says hes very so hes very
heather chandler again hits her ball into heather dukes
heather chandler slams heather dukes ball back into the flower bed
veronicas mom calls out the back screen door
heather your mothers here
come on whoever wants a ride
as the heathers head into the house veronica picks up heather dukes ball and exuberantly throws it back toward the wickets
veronicas mom carrying a tray of pate and dad carrying a robert ludlum book place themselves around a patio table
take a break veronica sit down
veronica sinks into the empty middle deck chair
so what was the first week of spring vacation withdrawl like
i dont know it was okay i guess
hey kid isnt the prom coming up
any contestants worth mentioning
may be theres kind of a dark horse now in the running
looking up goddamn
will somebody please tell me why i read this spy crap
smiling because youre an idiot
oh yeah thats it
dad immediately returns to reading with a wide grin
shaking her head you two
great pate but im going to have to motor if i want to be ready for the party tonight
a volkswagen cabriolet pulls up in front of a with heather chandler at the wheel
veronica pops out of the car into the store
heather chandler clamors to her
stylishly dressed to massacre veronica reaches out to a bag of corn nuts as j
s off screen voice disarms her
you going to pull a big gulp with that
no but if youre nice ill let you buy me a slurpee
you know your speak pretty well
ive been moved around all my life dallas baton rouge vegas sherwood ohio theres always a
any town any time i can pop a ham and cheese in the microwave and feast on a big wheel
keeps me sane
that thing in the caf today was pretty severe
the extreme always makes an impression but youre right it was severe
did you say a cherry or coke slurpee
veronica smiles at her coolness
returns the smile
veronica and j
slurp by j
s ferocious motorcycle
heather chandler sounds her car horn with a grimace
veronica glares at her then turns back to j
just a humble perk from my dads construction company or should i say deconstruction company
i dont know
my father seems to enjoy tearing things down more than putting things up
seen the commerical
bringing every state to a higher state
your pops fred dean construction
must be rough
moving place to place
everybodys lifes got static
is your life perfect
gently joking sure im on my way to a party at remington university
veronica grows serious as the car horn sounds again
its not perfect
i dont really like my friends
i dont really like your friends either
its like theyre just people i work with and our job is being popular and shit
maybe its time for a vacation
the car horn blares again
david heather chandlers fine looking college beau leads veronica and heather chandler into a cramped eclectically tacky dorm room
music pounds the door
the semi handsome brad leans aainst a desk while a whining student talks with coed one who sits on the floor
throw your coats on the bed girls
that exam was so bogus
oh i know which exam
veronica this is brad
did you girls bring your partying slippers
yeah lets party
she loves to party
as they head out the door brad whispers something in brads friends ear causing the pair to snarl off a laugh
the viewer is taken back and forth from a shattered post party veronica to the traumatic dormitory party itself
the sobbing monocled veronica writes at her desk
dear diary i want to kill and you have to believe
veronica frenziedly scribbles trying to get her pen to write
she throws the pen across the room and pulls out another
you have to believe its for more than selfish reasons
more than a spoke in my menstrual cycle
you have to believe me
the chaotic hallway rumbles with beer cups and loud music
veronica and heather chandlers stylish garb clashes with the laid back dress of the college students
brad anxiously hands veronica a cup of beer as he watches david and heather chandler move through a staircase door
so are you a cheerleader
dealing with a jerk no not at all
youre pretty enough to be one
its so great to be able to talk to a girl and not have to ask whats your major
i hate that
they uncomfortably sip their beers
a deadly pause ensues
so when you go to college what kind of subjects do you think youll study
heather chandler and david sit on the latters bed surrounded by a macintosh and a series of obnoxious ferrari posters
david doing most of the work
come on david lets go back to the party
unzipping his pants dont worry we will
youre just so hot tonight
i cant control myself
david pushes heather chandlers head down
brad has given up on conversation
so what do you say we head up to my room and have a real party
ive got the best windham hill c
collection in the dorm
a big amiable student approaches before veronica can show disgust
brad man robinsons looking for you
he says he owes you for blow and he just got some product himself
that pecker actually scored something on his own
ambling off hes in sheilas room guy
veronica ever do cocaine ever since phil collins did that mtv anti drug commercial i refuse everything
are you sure he isnt drinking and driving
jeez right then why dont i do drugs
hey dont run away now
with a wink brad squirms off
veronica dashes into the room with the coats
veronica rampages through her diary
seventeen is the last year mom buys the twinkies
when you make the jump from working weekends at pizza hut to thirty years at i
you lose something
not innocence power
the cat jumps onto the diary
veronica flings the screeching cat off and continues
christ i cant explain it but im allowed an understanding that my parents and these remington university assholes have chosen to ignore
i understand i must stop heather
panting veronica collapses at a desk in the coat room
she draws a vodka bottle from a stockpile of liquor and pours some in her beer cup slouching down in her chair
veronica lights a match from a matchbook
she eerily brings her hand closer and closer to the fire until it touches
with an eek of pain she tosses the match away into the vodka cup setting it afire
veronica laughs to herself before tossing the flaming cup out the window
the flaming cup lands in a large rusted garbage can filled with other cups and various refuse
the flames spread
a dejected heather chandler walks into a multi mirror and sink bathroom
using a glass off one of the sinks she gargles some water and then spits it at her own reflection
veronica closes the window as brad opens the door
hows my little cheerleader
now i know everyone at your high school isnt so uptight come on hey really i dont feel so great
lets do it on the coats
itll be excellent
brad plops down onto the bed of coats and begins bouncing
i have a little prepared speech i give when my suitor wants more than id like to give him
gee blank i had a nice
save the speeches for malcom x
i just wanna get laid
you dont deserve my fucking speech
veronica yanks up her coat from beneath brad on the bed causing him to slide off onto the floor
veronica storms into the hallway but slows down when she sees shes attracting attention
she notices an incited brad slither to the smiling david who chats with some students heather chandler on his arm
brad causes davids smile to ever so slightly diminish
david whispers to heather chandler who proceeds to set down her beer and walk toward veronica
the fire in the trashcan is raging
a steel faced heather chandler comes face to face with veronica
whats your damage
brad says youre being a real cooze
heather i feel awful like im going to throw up
can we jam please
veronicas eyes fall shut in a near faint
she flings herself down off screen with some ugly retching sounds
veronica savagely scrawls in her diary tears burning fierce
betty finn was a true friend and i sold her out for a bunch of swatchdogs and diet cokeheads
killing heatherd be like offing the wicked witch of the west
or is it east
west i sound like a psycho
tomorrow ill be kissing her aerobicized ass but tonight let me dream of a world without heather
a world where i am free
veronica rises into view with tinges of vomit on her mouth
a smile breaks across heather chandlers granite puss
veronica runs off as students laugh in the background
veronica charges into the alley
she whips around to face a screeching heather chandler
in back of veronica the trashcan bellows like mt
you stupid cunt
you goddamn bitch
the flickering flames cast heather chandler in a demonic light
you were nothing before you met me
you were playing barbies with betty finn
you were a brownie you were a bluebird you were a girl scout cookie
i got you into a remington party
whats my thanks
its on the hallway carpet
i get paid in puke
lick it up baby
totally in control monday morning youre history
ill tell everyone about tonight
transfer to washington
transfer to jefferson
no one at westerburgs going to let you play their reindeer games
veronica flings her diary across the room where it hits the wall behind the stunning figure of j
exhaling deeply sokay
i saw the croquet set up in the back
up for a match
veronica is simultaneously dismayed and exhilarated
she seems ready to burst out all her anxieties but instead
but im blue
the viewers viewpoint glides through the grass of veronicas backyard uncovering combinations of wickets and articles of clothing
a pair of girls shoes and a pair of guys shoes rest together by the first wicket
goddamn no wonder you looked so mangled when i came through the window
feminine socks and masculine socks lay crumpled by the next wicket
ive always treated heathers teen queen power plays as bullshit
as veronica quiveringly pauses a stylish blouse and a rugged shirt are revealed mingling by another wicket
but im really scared
who am i going to eat lunch with on monday
i sound like an afterschool special
the viewers viewpoint moves to a dress and a pair of jeans resting side by side at another wicket
that was my first game of strip croquet you know
i thank you
its a lot more interesting than just flinging off your clothes and boning away on the neighbors swing set
veronicas blue mallet has been staked into the ground
her panties hang on one end j
s underwear hangs on the other
well i dont know
theres something to be said for
veronica and j
are finally revealed entangled in an artful pose upon j
s gunslinger coat
they warmly kiss
veronica breaks off to uneasily giggle
what a night
gently bites in to veronicas neck
veronica grooves on it closing her eyes tightly
what a life
i almost moved into high school out of sixth grade because i was some genius
we all decided to chuck the idea because id have trouble making friends blah blah blah
veronica slides her head down against j
s chest and gracefully rests on his lap
gently fighting slumber she murmurs up to j
who showers her face with slow kisses
now blah blah blah is all i do
i use my grand i
to figure out what gloss to wear and how to hit three keggers before curfew
heather chandler is one bitch that deserves to die
killing her wont solve anything
a well timed lightning bolt through her window and monday morning all the other heathers shit everybody would be cast fucking adrift
well then ill pray for rain
see the condoms in the grass over there
we killed tonight veronica
we murdered our baby
hey it was good for me too sparky
just saying its not hard to end a life
theres a big difference between the most popular girl in the school and dead sperm
veronica maneuvers herself into a sitting position
i guess i dont know what the hell im talking about
i know exactly what the hell youre talking about and youre right you dont know what the hell youre talking about
lets just grow up be adults and die
but before that id like to see heather chandler puke her guts out
heather chandlers bedroom is lushly and expensively furnished with a glass coffee table as an eye catching centerpiece
heather chandler half sleeps in twisted bedsheets as mrs
chandler sticks her head in the door
we are leaving soon for your grandmothers
if you care to join us
is that a no in your lingo
as the door closes heather chandler raises her arm and gives her departed mother the finger
the sound of a lock being jimmied is heard moments before veronica and j
burst through the door
quietly trust me
she skips the saturday morning trip to grandmas even when shes not hungover
then lets just concoct ourselves a little hangover cure thatll induce her to spew red white and blue
veronica opens the refrigerator
opens the cupboard beneath the sink
what about orange juice and milk
whats the upchuck factor on that
holds up a bottle of pine sol
im a pine sol man myself
dont be a dick
that stuffll kill her
veronica and j
make queasy eye contact
veronica descends back into the refrigerator with some worked up enthusiasm as j
suavely pours bits of various toxic containers detergent scouring powder into a glass beer mug
well cook up some soup and put it in a coke
now should it be chicken noodle or bean with bacon
man veronica pull the plug on that shit
i say we go with big blue
raises the glass filled with what is now a strange blue liquid
veronica stares at the glass scared by her own thoughts
what are you doing you just cant go
besides shed never drink anything that looks like that
okay well use this
she wont be able to tell what shes drinking
pulls down a ceramic cup and triumphantly pours the poisonously blue beer glass contents into it
an eerie pause ensues
veronica takes out a milk carton and a container of orange juice
she struts back to the counter in anger icily muttering
just give me a cup jerk
sheepishly pulls down an identical ceramic cup
veronica tears it from him and pours some milk and then some orange juice into the cup
milk and orange juice
maybe we could cough a phlegm globber in it or something
they both start coughing harshly
well milk and orange juicell do quite nicely
youre not funny
turns on his heel and slinks away
veronica glares down at the mess of toxic containers
with both arms veronica clumps the toxic containers together and drops beneath the sink to put them away
swaggers back into the kitchen as veronica bobs back into view
kisses the back of her neck
veronica closes her eyes with a grudging smile
veronica dreamily reaches out to one of the two ceramic cups
not the one with milk and orange juice in it
heather chandler angelically sleeps as veronica and j
like a lion heather chandler rouses herself up
and jesse james
hear about veronicas affection for regurgitation
we both said a lot of things we didnt mean last night
how the helld you get in here
veronica knew youd have a hangover
so i whipped this up
holds out the ceramic cup
heather chandler snorts
did you put a phlegm globber in it or something
im not drinking that piss
i knew this stuff would be too intense
you think ill drink it just because you call me chicken they do
just give me the cup jerk
heather chandler rises from the bed and struts to j
she takes the cup slams her head back and downs it all
she then launches her head forward her face contorted in agony
heather chandlers eyes slam shut and her limp body crashes through the glass coffee table
veronica and j
something tells me you picked up the wrong cup
no shit sherlock
i cant believe it
i just killed my best friend
and your worst enemy
oh jesus im gonna
veronica staggers to a desk
laughs out of shock
what are we going to tell the cops
fuck it if she cant take a joke sarge
stop kidding around
im going to have to send my s
scores to san quentin instead of stanford
im just a little freaked all right
a beat you got what you wanted you know
its one thing to want somebody out of your life
its another thing to serve them a wake up cup of drano
veronica stares off as j
paces like a caged animal
he scopes onto the rubble of the shattered coffee table and sees cliff notes for the bell jar plus a magazine proclaiming the fall of the american teen sticking out
from beneath heather chandlers body
we did a murder
in ohio thats a crime
but if this was like a suicide thing
like a suicide thing
adolescence is a period of life fraught with anxiety and confusion
calming down i can do heathers handwriting as well as my own
veronica takes some stationery from the desk and begins writing calling out her words
you might think what ive done is shocking
to me though suicide is the natural answer to the myriad of problems life has given me
thats good but heather would never use the word myriad
this is the last thing shell ever write
shell want to cash in on as many fifty cent words as poss
she missed myriad on a vocab test two weeks ago all right
that only proves my point more
the word is a badge for her failures at school
youre probably right
people think just because youre beautiful and popular life is easy and fun
nobody understood i had feelings too
i die knowing no one knew the real me
have you done this before
veronicas smile dies as she looks to heather chandlers corpse
at the head of a long conference table is the bearlike principal gowan
circling the table is the gray haired but savvy mrs
pope the black counselor paul hyde the yuppie math teacher kevin staples and most noticeably the eccentrically dressed ms
coats are in chairs and cigarette smoke is in the air as the group batters their way through a morning mourning conference
any other principal would take the same position
keep things business as usual
heather chandlers not your everyday suicide
she was very popular
i let the kids go before lunch and the switchboardll light up like a christmas tree
the parents will be sympathetic sir
these are troubled times for the young
i must say i was impressed to see that she made proper use of the word myriad in her suicide note after brutalizing it in a vocabulary test
dramatically cutting in i find it profoundly disturbing that we are told of a tragic destruction of youth and all we can talk about is adequate mourning times and misused
a collective sigh goes across the room
the school meaning both students and teachers must revel in this revealing moment
i suggest we get everyone into the cafeteria and just talk
thank you ms
call me when the shuttle lands
now is this heather the cheerleader
that would be heather mcnamara
id be willing to go half a day for a cheerleader
lets just pack it in an hour early
i hate mondays
the desks of the classroom have been maneuvered into an amusingly chaotic position by paulines pupils
she is furious
i said a circle you imbeciles
just sit down
im just so thrilled to be given an example of everything ive taught you
that example is heather chandler
i have the note
pauline melodramatically lifts the suicide note
the class aaahs
ill pass the suicide note around the room so you can feel its tragic beauty for yourself
let us share together the feelings the suicide has spurred in us all
who wants to begin
i heard it was really gnarly
she drank liquid plumber and comet and stuff then she smashed
now now were not here to rehash the coroners report
lets talk emotions are we going to be tested on this
a stunned pauline glares until preppie peter dawson speaks
the note continues to be breathlessly passed around
heather and i used to go together but she said i was boring
i realize now i wasnt really boring
she was just dissatisfied with her life
thats very good peter
veronica lets out a laugh that she disguises as a sob by putting her hands over her face
dear veronica heather was your soulmate
heather was cool but cruel
the good looks and bad manners gave her power but it could not give her happiness
the class stares to veronica as the suicide note is passed to her
she acknowledges it in horror passes it on then continues realizing her ability to create truths for a captive audience
she realized the only way she could be happy was to give up her power and the only way she could do that was death
the pupils applaud
veronica queasily smiles
the girls are finishing up putting on their clothes
oh god its so unfair
its just so unfair we should get a whole week off not just an hour
write the school board
heather duke gnaws on a chicken leg as she speaks
watch it heather
you could actually be digesting food
yeah wheres your urge to purge
belching fuck it
heather mcnamara pulls a swatch from one of the lockers
look heather left behind one of her swatches
shed want you to have it veronica
she always said you couldnt accessorize for shit
heather mcnamara tosses the watch to a spooked veronica who stands up and solemnly puts it on
the female stoner in army jacket stops next to their bench
im sorry about your friend
i thought she was your usual airhead bitch
guess i was wrong
lot of us were
heather duke bobs up from the worlds largest sno cone
what a waste
veronica zombiesquely moves into the shower area
oh the humanity
veronica turns on a shower and lets the water spray against her clothes
veronica what are you doing
everyone in the shower
the squealing girl runs into the shower fully clothed
two giggling girls follow suit
the heathers look to each other laugh and run in
heavy metalers matt clyde and steve plus geek rodney sneak into a darkened room
girls laughter drifts in
do i deliver or do i deliver
hurry up were going to get caught
mellow out geek
man i never should have brought you
lets see some pus sy matt pulls a curtain revealing a semi overhead view of the showering and clothed girls
the girls splash and spin in balletlike slow motion
veronica stands facing the viewer the swatch noticeably attached
cautiously quiet pandemonium
does this have something to do with menstrual cramps and shit
dazed what the fuck
were on candid camera dudes
i can feel it
what the fuck
do you deliver or do you deliver
pulling their coats over their wet clothes veronica and the heathers come out of the school
that was seriously warped veronica
in the distance a t
camera crew is interviewing students
heather duke dashes toward them
heather mcnamara freezes
oh god veronica
heather mcnamara moans vibrates then suddenly races toward the cameras
veronica looks down at the soaked stopped swatch on her arm
she takes it off and drops it in a nearby trashcan
a massive t
set shows the image of heather duke posed by a tree talking into a microphone
i choose to remember the good times
like when we got our ears pierced at the mall
the image of heather mcnamara sitting in the grass talking into a microphone supersedes heather dukes
i can still hear those late night talks on the phone
the image of peter dawson sitting on a rock comes on next
the day i won her that stuffed rhino at the h fair she said to me
youre an asshole
veronica and j
are seen to be crashed on a couch
pushes a button on the remote control cutting the sound
next channel darling
the silent image of heather duke on a staircase talking into a microphone is on the screen
heather how many networks did you run to
country club courtney appears wearing a t shirt reading bigfun
veronica takes the remote and turns the sound on
oh i have to hear this
in my heart heathers still alive
muting courtney what are you talking about
she hated you
you hated her
what are you smiling at
heather chandler is more popular than ever now
suddenly looks away from veronica with a mischievous half smile
he inexplicably calls out
why son i didnt hear you come in
s father fred dean stands before them handsome and threatening in a shirt and tie
he is rather malevolently holding a rowing machine
hey dad how was work today
fred dean slams down his rowing machine and straddles it before answering his own question
he rows as he speaks
the brady bunch sputters on the t
screen before him
it was miserable
some damn tribe of withered old bitches doesnt want us to terminate that fleabag hotel
all because glenn miller and his band once took a shit there
its just like kansas
do you remember fucking kansas
that was the one with the wheat right
the save the memorial oak tree society
showed those fucks
turns to veronica with a bemused smile
thirty fourth of july fireworks attached to the trunk
arraigned but acquitted
gosh pop i almost forgot to introduce my girlfriend
veronica with a forced smile reaches to shaked freds hand
fred dean extends his hand but makes no effort to stop rowing hence his hand pulls away from veronica
pop and son laugh
jason why dont you ask your little friend to stay for dinner
awkwardly standing my moms making my favorite meal tonight
lots of oregano
the last time i saw my mom she was waving out the window of a library in texas
right dad big bud dean stops rowing to grin a you think youre tougher than me but youre not smile to j
right son weakly right
just as in the earlier patio scene dad and mom sawyer are seated at a patio table with an empty chair between them
pate is on the table
dad smokes a cigarette
take a break veronica sit down
veronica walks into view and sits down
so what was the first day after heathers suicide like
i dont know it was okay i guess
so will we get to meet this dark horse prom contender
may be looking at his cigarette goddamn
will somebody please tell me why i smoke these damn things
smiling because youre an idiot
oh yeah thats it
dad immediately takes another drag with a wide grin
shaking her head you two
greate pate but im going to have to motor if i want to be ready for the funeral tomorrow
a montage commences showing the heathers preparing for the funeral
heather mcnamara models an all black outfit in front of a dressing table mirror
she storms away pouting
bobbing up from a fashion magazine whose cover story is funeral chic heather duke finishes applying black lipstick
a look of horror passes over her face and she savagely scrubs her lips
a mortician puts the finishing touches on heather chandler smoothing out her clothes and buffing her face
he gently kisses her forehead then quickly rebuffs the spot
heather mcnamara models another black outfit
she responds this time with a satisfied smile
traditionally made up a smiling heather duke brings a crucifix earring to her ear and attaches it
heather chandler serenely lies in a coffin as father faust bellows off screen
a panorama of adults and students is revealed at this more social than spiritual event
veronica and j
watch from the back pew
i blame not heather but rather a society that tells its youth that the answers are on the mtv video games
we must pray the other teenagers of sherwood ohio know the name of that righteous dude who can solve their problems
the bald father faust finally comes into view
contd its jesus christ and hes in the book
betty finn is kneeling before heather chandlers open coffin
the viewer hears what she is thinking
may heather chandler rest in peace even though she committed suicide
for the kingdom the power and the glory are yours now and forever amen
betty finn makes the sign of the cross rises and exits
heather mcnamara takes her place on the kneeling podium
oh god this is a tragic thing and sometimes i have a hard time dealing with it and stuff
please send heather to heaven and all that
i mean amen
heather mcnamara exits and peter dawson moves in her place
dear god make sure this never happens to me
i do not think i could handle suicide and thats the gods honest truth
pardon the pun
fast early acceptance into an ivy league school and please let it be harvard
peter flees and ram uncomfortably takes his place
jesus god in heaven uh why did you kill such hot snatch
thats a joke man
people are so serious
a beat hail mary who arent in heaven pray for us sinners
so we dont get caught
another joke man
ram clumsily exits
heather duke solemnly kneels in his place
i prayed for the death of heather chandler many times and i felt bad every time i did but i kept doing it anyway
now i know you understood everything
heather duke departs and veronica kneels in her place
technically i didnt kill heather chandler but hey who am i trying to kid right
i just want my high school to be a nice place
did that sound bitchy
heather mcnamara dips a big comb in the holy water basin and then combs out her hair
veronica breezes by
what are you doing tonight

ram asked me out but he wants to double with kurt and kurt doesnt have a date
hea ther ive got something going with j

kurt kelly and ram stand by rams van

weird funeral huh
geeks rodney fat cynic and braces thrust by kurt and ram
braces obliviously steps on kurts foot
that pudwapper just stepped on my foot
lets kick his ass
cool off were seniors
braces gives them the finger
awkwardly defiant sit and spin
kurt and ram turn to each other more amused than angered
that little prick
the bolting jocks effortlessly catch braces and put him into a hunched over position
the other geeks look on ashamed
all right you piece of shit fag do you like to suck big dicks
cut it out
ram pushes braces down harder
say it man
say i like to suck big dicks
leave him alone kurt
rides by on his motorcycle
he turns to watch kurt wearing an overwhelmingly tinted motorcycle helmet that reads the true killer across the top
kurt is spooked
okay okay you like to suck big dicks
unamused ram throws braces to the ground
braces semi cries
i like to suck big dicks
mmm mm i cant get enough of them
im sure your friends are happy to hear that
with a lisp right guys veronica and heather mcnamara sashay through the parking lot
dont worry rams been so sweet lately consoling me and stuff
itll be really very
moving into the background braces wipes dirt and blood off his face as his friends glumly watch on
all right but i hope it isnt going to be one of those nights where they get shitfaced and take us to a pasture to tip cows
a cow stands sleeping
giggling and drunk kurt and ram scramble around the cow
uncomfortable and sober veronica and heather mcnamara look on
is it sleeping dude
i think so man
then get over on my side
oh shit cowtipping is the fucking greatest
punch it in
kurt and ram slam their knuckles and then lean against the cow poised to shove
heather mcnamara manages a smile but veronica glares it away
count of three guy
moo and the jocks laughter is heard as mud splashes against the mortified faces of veronica and heather mcnamara
kurt stumbles after a more annoyed than scared veronica
when i get that feeling i need sexual healing
yeah right asshole
veronica makes her way up a hill pausing to compassionately stare at ram on top of a dispirited heather mcnamara
kurts intoxicated brain has trouble dealing with the incline
appears at the top of the hill
kurt squints up the hill and falls over backwards
what is this shit
im doing a favor for heather
a double date
i tried to tell you at the funeral but you rode off
still face down feel like making bah da dah bah da dah feel like making love
another fucking heather
harshly laughs im sorry
im feeling kind of superior tonight
seven high schools in seven states and the only thing different was my locker combination
weve broke through the peer pressure cooker
so what if we had to kill miss popularity
veronica clumsily high heels it up the hill
dont smile like that jesus
our love is god
lets get a slurpee
solemnly reaches toward veronica
she less solemn takes his hand
their bodies disappear over the hill
and shes buying the stairway to heaven
in a cluttered school workshop editor dennis and a yearbook girl wearing a bigfun t shirt confer over a layout sheet
denniss famine fund partner peter dawson pouts behind them
im not belittling the famine fund peter but were talking teen suicide
westerburg finally got one and im not going to blow it
heather gets the headline and i get crammed in by the taco bell coupon
veronica breezes in
i came to check on this weeks lunchtime poll topic
dont worry about it veronica sit down
that funeral yesterday must have been really rough
we were uh wondering if maybe you had some poems or artwork that heather did that we could put in the heather chandler yearbook spread
take a look
well have a two page layout with her suicide note up here in the right hand corner
its more tasteful than it sounds
country club courtney and courtneys friend come in giggling and whispering
seeing veronica they stop dead then slide into chairs laughing softly
i dont know
this thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth
like last night veronica
courtney and courtneys friend explode in laughter
i dont get it
you did last night
kurt told us of your little date
i left him drunk and flailing in cowshit
i dont know
he was really detailed
shut up courtney
dont shut up
id like to know just what i did
gesturing to the door let me show you that lunchtime poll topic veronica
peter tells veronica
rarely listen to neanderthals like kurt kelly bu ut he said you were bent over like a coffee table with kurt going in one end and ram coming in the
pardon the pun
dazed pardon the pun
son of a bitch dizzy veronica hands a clump of dollar bills to peter
thanks pete for the famine fund
peter cheerfully pockets the cash as veronica drifts off
veronica arousingly speaks into her phone
this is veronica sawyer
i didnt expect to be calling either
i guess my emotions took over
i was wondering if you wanted all those things youve been saying to really happen
its always been a fantasy of mine to have two guys at once
sure you can write penthouse forum
revealed to be lounging on her bed j
laughs out loud
veronica throws a book at him
thats right tonight
in the woods behind the school
dont forget ram
kurt hangs up with an amazed expression on his face
veronica and j
load guns on veronicas bed
veronica breaks into a laugh
i dont get the point of me writing a suicide note when well just be shooting them with blanks
we wont be using blanks this time
you cant be serious
hey listen my bonnie and clyde days are over
veronica drops her gun in revulsion and launches off her bed
with a patient smile j
pulls her back down
do you take german
flicks open his gun and pulls a bullet from the chamber
these are ich luge bullets
my grandfather snared a shitload of them in w
theyre like tranquilizers only they break the surface of the skin enough to cause blood but not any real harm
so it looks like the persons been shot and killed when theyre really just unconscious and bleeding
nods then stands to pace the room his mind whirring
we shoot kurt and ram
make it look like they shot each other
by the time kurt and ram regain consciousness theyll be the laughingstocks of the school
the notes the punchline
howd it turn out
veronica clumsily extracts the note from her purse
she also plucks out the crumpled yellow sample of kurts handwriting of the opening note forge scene
she proudly displays both papers
first tell me this similarity is not incredible
warmly incredible similarity
veronica pulls back the note and reads
ram and i died the day we realized we could never reveal our forbidden love to an uncaring and ununderstanding world
the joy we shared in each others arms was greater than any touchdown
yet we were forced to live the lie of sexist beer guzzling jock asshole
exquisite but i dont think ununderstanding is a word
we dont want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent
why would the germans invent a bullet that doesnt kill people
i mean it was world war two not a school play
rapid fire they used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead
really quite a brilliant device but too flamboyant to seriously produce
lets try it out on j
veronica swiftly picks up her gun and aims it at the lovable tabby entering the room
rips it away from her
it doesnt work on small animals
uh well hey lets take a look at the homosexual artifacts i dug up
now prepare to be a little disappointed
lifts up a feminine shopping bag and gently dumps the contents on the bed
weve got a playgirl a candy dish a joan crawford post card and lipstick
you must have had fun
you know it
oh man i almost forgot
the one perfecto thing i picked up
reaches in both his coat pockets and triumphantly raises out two bottles of perrier water
oh come on lots of people drink perrier
its come a long way
this is ohio
if you dont have a brewsky in your hand after dark you might as well be wearing a dress
mock seductively oh youre so smart
how about a little heterosexuality before we go
laughs then climbs onto veronica for a hugging kiss
a tense kurt and an excited ram playing air guitar walk through the parking lot toward the woods
singing sex and drugs and hbo is all i ever need
can you hear me
i said sex and drugs and
shut the fuck up all right
lighten up dude
in those woods is some of the finest pussy in the school and we dont even have to buy it a hamburger and a diet coke
punch it in
kurt feebly slams knuckles with ram
veonica stands in the middle of a clearing in the woods
she nervously tucks the gun in the back of her dress as kurt and ram emerge into the clearing from a path in the woods
forced cheerfulness hi guys
glad you could make it
ram smacks his hands together
so do we just start fucking
ive made a circle on each end of the clearing
ram you come over here
kurt steps into the scratched in the dirt circle next to him
a confused ram walks past veronica and steps into a circle at the opposite end of the foggy clearing
when you get in the circle strip
the guys pause then slowly start taking off their clothes
what about you
i was hoping youd rip my clothes off me sport
kurt and ram awkwardly stand at opposite ends in their undies
count of three guys
ram giggles in anticipation
kurt finally cracks a smile
suddenly moves next to veronica holding a gun in his right hand and the feminine shopping bag in his left
almost non chalantly shoots ram in the forehead
veronica rips out her gun and swings it toward kurt
using both hands she fires but misses completely
kurt runs away onto the path
veronica throws down her gun with a smile
races to veronica in a white sweat
did you miss him completely
giggling yeah but dont worry it was worth it just to see the look on
ill get him back
veronicas laughter cuts off like a faucet
suddenly trembling and confused she watches j
bolt into the woods
a panicked kurt runs on the path through the woods
with a cold efficiency weaves through trees
veronica turns toward rams collapsed body
kurt sees the opening at the end of the woods
suddenly moves into the light at the end of the woods and raises his gun
kurt runs back the other way with a strangled moan
veronica approaches rams body with increasing shivers
he does not look bleeding and unconscious
he looks bleeding and dead dead dead
kurt barrels into the clearing as j
howls from the woods
in a burst of frightened animal instinct veronica whips around and fires her gun right into kurts chest
two cops milner and mccord smoke marijuana in a squad car already filled with smoke
after a coughing fit milner shouts
i heard it that time
from the woods
mccord shit lets roll
the two officer explode out of the car
puts his gun in rams right hand while veronica zombiesquely does the same with kurt and her gun
kurt doesnt look too good
remember hes left handed
a quivering veronica puts the gun in kurts left hand
keep going until you hit the clearing
s head snaps forward
he yanks up veronica
they both run into the woods behind rams body as the two cops charge into the clearing guns raised
seeing the jocks they stop
mccord mother of shit
milner looks toward where veronica and j
i heard something out there
im checking it out
milner runs off as mccord shouts into a walkie talkie
he is holding the pulse of kurt kelly
mccord this is officer mccord and ive got two dead bodies in the woods behind westerburg high
oh my god one of thems kurt kelly the quarterback
veronica and j
flow through the trees
an owl hoos
milner blindly barrels through the woods
veronica and j
come out of the woods and start running up a grassy hill toward veronicas car which is parked on top
milner is jolted by an owl hoo then continues moving
veronica and j
reach the car panting
milner races out of the woods just as veronica and j
slam the car doors closed behind them
milner huffs up the hill
veronica and j
somersault into the backseat and begin taking off their clothes
milner continues to move up the hill
veronica and j
stripped down to their underwear embrace
milner approaches the car and peers in
his crackling walkie talkie startles him
walkie talkie milner can you hear me
whats going down
milner moves away from the car then speaks into his walkie talkie
think what i heard was just a stinking owl
all i got is two kids making out in the backseat of a car
should i pry them apart
walkie talkie forget it
i got all the answers back here partner
seeing the cop move away
veronica and j
they catch their breath smile then continue passionately necking
milner runs back into the clearing
whats the deal
they shot each other
thats kurt kelly
mccord yeah and the linebacker ram sweeney
oh my god suicide
mccord does this answer your question
mccord reaches in the feminine shopping bag and pulls out the bottles of perrier water
oh man they were fags mccord listen up we could never reveal our forbidden love to an uncaring and ununderstanding world
ah jesus h
kurt was a parade magazine honorable mention
milner shakes his head slowly then suddenly looks up
wait a second
how did they shoot each other if we heard two separate sets of gunshots
mccord shit i always hear gunshots when im high
life is one crazy bitch
dont try to analyze it
the quarterback buggering the linebacker
what a waste
oh the humanity
another morning mourning conference
the participants look a little more frazzled
pauline sits at the head of the table
sotto voce to counselor hyde after every touchdown or whatever they give each other a little slap on the bottom
it seems innocent
the elderly mrs
pope shakes her head at the suicide note
look at this
will you shut up
we were in a similar position monday and i thoughtfully suggested that we get the students together for an unadulterated emotional outpouring
you took the suggestion as an opportunity to play yet another round of lets laugh at the hippie
pauline if you want a tryout for the school play
principal gowan hoarsely breaks in
shut up paul
ive seen a lot of bullshit angel dust switchblades sexually perverse photography exhibits involving tennis racquets but this suicide thing
i guess its all on paulines wavelength
were just going to write off today and friday she can do her little little love in or whatever
veronicas car is the lone vehicle in the student parking lot
a battered veronica climbs into the front seat pulling on her blazer
she presses in the car cigarette lighter
rumbles from the back as other cars begin to fill the lot
we killed them didnt we
veronica tugs out the car lighter and savagely brands the palm of her hand
hurdles into the front seat and bats the lighter away
he lights a cigarette off the scorched flesh of veronicas hand as she wails away
ich luge bullets
im an idiot
drags on his cigarette
school buses are pulling in outside of the parking lot in front of the school
you believed it because you wanted to believe it
your true feelings were too gross and icky for you to face
i did not want them dead did to
launches into a rapid fire rendition of did tos
veronica responds by holding her hands over her ears and singing were off to see the wizard
s did tos get louder causing veronica to bang on the horn
heather duke and a vegged out heather mcnamara stop sauntering through the parking lot to contemplate veronicas hiccuping car and its sparring occupants
ah young love
the squealing girl bounds up to the heathers
did you hear
schools cancelled today because kurt and ram killed themselves in a repressed homosexual suicide pact
incredulous but amused no way
pulls veronica off the horn and warmly places an unlit cigarette in her mouth
as he speaks veronica wearily takes the cigarette from her mouth and puts it in her blazer pocket
football seasons over veronica
kurt and ram had nothing to offer the school but date rapes and a
looking to her burnt hand sure
can we make an ice run before the funeral
students head back to their cars and the buses pull back out
a typically john waynesque jocks father type mr
kelly stands over his sons open grave
father faust and a seated mixture of adults and students watch on
if theres any way you can hear me kurt buddy i dont care that you really were some pansy
youre my flesh and blood
you made me proud
i love my homosexual son
my sons gay and i love him
in dark sunglasses veronica wearily leans over to j
your sons dead and you love him
how do you think mr
kelly would react to a son with a limp wrist with a pulse
they quietly laugh
veronica sees a little girl staring at her
she is wearing kurts football jersey and her face is soaked in tears
veronicas smile turns into a nauseated grimace
still in stylish funeral garb and dark sunglasses veronica collapses onto her couch splaying next to her mom
the sawyer t
flashes against veronicas shades
how was the funeral
a young statuesque blonde appears on screen
a super reading whitney james w
commentary flashes on
it looks like the teen suicide epidemic has hit home in sherwood as the death toll at westerburg high rockets to three
a shiny number three flashes on and off in the screens corner
heather chandler kurt kelly and rupert ram sweeney all had good looks and popularity but theres one thing they didnt have values ambition and hope
thats three things
it rained everyday of my maui vacation but hey i didnt kill myself
im whitney james commentary
the camera pans to an affable anchorman
thanks whitney but i hate to say it
it looks like you brought that rainy weather back with you
tomorrows forecast calls for
veronica lies on the floor next to a vodka bottle
she drinks out of a dixie cup as she talks on the phone
no its okay j
i just kind of wanted to talk
oh a newsmagazine show on channel
on the suicides
no sounds great
veronica hangs up and looks to her battered diary lying against the wall
she crawls to the diary and then reaches up to her night table to pull down her monocle and a pen
she sucks a cup of vodka and begins writing
dear diary my teen angst bullshit has a body count
sitting up against her bed veronica continues writing as j
laps up vodka from the dixie cup
the most popular people in the school are dead
everybodys sad but its a good kind of sad
suicide gave heather depth kurt a soul ram a brain
i gave j
shit about the ich luge thing but what really frightens me is that im not frightened by what j
ll do next
its god versus my boyfriend and gods losing
veronica drops her head back and closes her eyes popping out her monocle
she swoons down against the bed onto the floor and curls into a fetal slumber
students eat and buzz together in typical cacophony
all are wearing black armbands
a jukebox roars
pauline fleming and an entourage of students such as peter dawson and the heathers invade the cafeteria heads raised high
peter kill the jukebox
as the jukebox amusingly grinds to a halt pauline hoists up a bullhorn to her lips and crackles
could i have your attention
a startled geek rodney splatters milk all over himself
students whip their heads around to the front of the cafeteria
martha dunnstock dumptruck warily looks up from her plate
pauline fleming chants with soaring self importance
our school has been torn apart by tragedy
im here today to fuse it back together through love
i want everyone to clasp hands
we need to connect this cafeteria into one mighty circuit
lets begin a new happiness
a tableau of dumbfounded students stare at the bullhorn woman
hungover in dark sunglasses veronica stumbles down the hall
she stops to read a sign plastered on a wall the new happiness a special lunchtime announcement ala pauline fleming
veronica takes off her sunglasses squints then continues down the hall
paulines evita peron like composure is crumbling
yo whats the problem
i know you know how to hold hands
ring around the rosy a pocketful of posy
im just so thrilled to announce that whitney james of wetc news is taping a rap session with students from area high schools including westerburg cheers raucously emerge from the
lets show the world westerburg is a diverse happy home not suicide central
shrewdly you know theres some people who say westerburg is too weak and wimpy a school to be on t
is that true
the students make loud scattered rumblings of the word no
pauline hungrily unbuttons her paisley blazer
no or hell no
louder hell no
frightened and flustered by the fanatic camaraderie around her martha dunnstock dumptruck quakes for a moment then crawls underneath her table
i cant hear you
fingering her bangs in an attempt at composure veronica steps into the cafeteria and her fellow students boom
as a blown away veronica takes in the panorama of students from different cliques chanting to the beat of paulines gospel recital paulines voice is replaced on the soundtrack by
the evocative female moanings of the opening scene
also wearing a black armband stalks veronica from behind
his hand unzips her dress
the female voices swell louder as a glowing veronica takes in glorious images
geek braces and a jock chant together standing on chairs
heather mcnamara and heavy metaler matt look to each other dubiously then mindlessly shout out
a morrisonesque stoner dances on a table of cheering betty finn a likes
slides his hand through the opening in veronicas dress
the female voices cut off as the spell over veronica breaks
she swings her elbow into j
cant you see this is a special moment
i was just making it more special
veronica there you are
veronica spins to an electric pauline fleming glistening in the mouth of the cafeteria flanked by heather duke and peter dawson
you people are in charge of getting delegates from every clique in the school to be on the whitney james teenage suicide prevention t
lets be able to say we were the ones who put peer pressure out to pasture
looks out through the cafeteria
he sees martha poke her head out from beneath her lunch table then dart back under
moves away from the chattering group
a happy family
im sure youll work something out
wickedly dont worry
well work something out
well work something out
i swear to god
wont we j
martha slithers from under the table up into her seat and head down trys to finish off a bowl of soup
she slowly looks up and freezes
is revealed to be seated across from her behind his rebel without a cause lunch box
he smiles warmly
greetings and salutations
veronica beams and babbles over the room while on the couch j
restlessly works his channel changer
you shoulda stuck around jerk
fleming wants to redefine the high school experience
she wants to ignore the high school experience
our ways better
we scare people into not being assholes
dont even talk about that stuff
comically cups his hands together to holler
you mean the time you blew kurt kellys ass away
veronica throws the first thing she can get her hands on a framed picture of a woman at the roaring j
you can be so immature
looking off you kids are making too much damn noise
fred dean is revealed to be standing in the front doorway holding a chest exerciser and waving a videocassette
we beat the bitches
mumbling oh beautiful
the beavers home
judge told em to slurp shit and die
fred dean crams the cassette in his v
and hefts up a chest exerciser
he begins pumping away as the image of a shabby building appears on the massive t
i put a norwegian in the boiler room
when that blew it set off a pack of thermals id stuck upstairs
the building blows up
fred dean cackles
fred pops out the videocassette and bounces away
its great to be alive
do you like your father
never given the matter much thought
liked my mother
picks up the framed picture that veronica threw
they said her death was an accident
but she knew when the explosives were set to go off
veronica slowly sits down next to j
with dazed concern
fleming has given us a chance to atone for
if you put a nazi in a concentration camp does that make you a nazi
may be j
exhales in frustration and changes some more channels
a music video flashes on the dead t
three gorgeous women stylishly furnished evocatively wail the female moans heard throughout the film
the video viewpoint then pans to two overly gorgeous young men wearing trendy hair and trendy clothes
they sing shout before an all white background
a super in the corner reads bigfun teenage suicide dont do it
its the new bigfun video
now in full screen the video viewpoint cuts to a very depressed and very cute white female vid victim one sitting at her dressing table
she pours a bottle of pills into her hand
bigfun magically materialize next to vid victim one
the pills in her hand have turned into jellybeans
she is ridiculously happy
pulls out a gun with an ethereal expression on his face
weve made mtv
fires into the radiant image of bigfun destroying the t
and disgusting veronica who bolts off the couch
he raucously crawls after her
were breaking up
i am out
come on theres another t
in the kitchen
you know you used to have a sense of humor
playfully tackles veronica
this calms rather than angers
she turns on her back
youre getting too cool for me j
i dont know how to talk to you
our relationships moving fast i know but i have real real respect for you
veronica sighs then rolls over into a crawling position and eventually into a walking out the door position
im going to make this ms
pauline thing work
lines of communication between the cliques
you were a phase
phase my ass
youll be back im storming normandy beaches and youre running in place with pauline fondas airhead peacenik exercise program
have to stay tough
youll be back
bounds up to a kitchen counter and flicks on a small t
bigfun can be heard booming their song
moves to an empty row of desks
he turns the first desk as to face the second
heather duke warily lowers herself into the second desk as j
flops a manilla envelope onto it
heather duke opens the envelope and pulls out a stack of by s
the first shot shows a young heather duke in a summer camp uniform that vibrantly reads heather she is holding one end of a large poster board drawing of two
eskimos rubbing noses
holding the other end in a summer camp uniform vibrantly reading martha is a young martha dunnstock dumptruck
with a harsh laugh she takes in the next photograph
it has young heather duke and young martha eating toasted marshmallows off each others sticks
trying to stay clam where did you get these
oh i just had the nicest chat with ms
got along famously
its scary how everyones got a story to tell
would you care to see the canoeing shots
what do you want from me
westerburg doesnt need mushy togetherness it needs a leader
heather chandler was that leader but
but she couldnt handle it
shes on the ball
i think you can
in catcher in the rye holden says his ideal jobd be making sure some kids dont fall off a cliff
he doesnt realize if you pay too much attention to the kids youll back off the cliff yourself
ill ask you to do me a favor
youll get the negatives and everything back then
launches away from his desk with a grin
he places a red ribbon on heather dukes desk
in the meantime strength and hey theres a little gift
a spooked heather duke splashes water on her face and looks up into the mirror
in a trance she pulls her hair back heather chandler fashion and ties it with the ribbon j
a betty finn a like moves up to the sink beside her
two chic babes enter the bathroom with pouting expressions
seemingly in a trance heather duke bends over and wipes off her wet hands using the oblivious betty finn a likes dress
heather duke winks to the now giggling chic babes and saunters off
heather duke bursts through the bathroom door to wickedly strut down the hall
she scowls smiles in perfect heather chandler fashion to various passers by
veronica genially lobbys the big black earl frazier
let me get it clear veronica
you want yourself a sweet homeboy for this t
show so you can show everybody what a loose martin luther cosby lovng place westerburg is
chuckling something like that
will you do it
damn youre a shrewd one
i just want to show different kinds of people can get together and it doesnt have to be vietnam
you dont get treated badly here do you
i dont get treated at all but hey dont worry about it
ill do your thing
itll give my mom a smile
veronica hands him a guest pass tag
things are going to change earl
heather duke impishly blinds veronica with her hands
heather duke lets go with a small giggle
veronica turns to face her heather chandler looking friend and her smile dies
veronica violently pushes heather duke away and storms off
lying on the floor veronica concentrates on her phone
with a deep sigh she pushbuttons out a number
she pauses then
your machines got the most obnoxious beep
heather im sorry
veronicas voice drones through heather dukes answering machine
machine im just calling to say you can wear your hair any way you want to
a male hand picks up the phone
its college boy david
hey veronica sawyer barf on anybodys carpet lately
is this david
what are you doing
what can i say
i was pretty broken up by heather c
i needed somebody super sensitive like heather d
im delirious for the both of you
can you put heather on
david proudly looks down off screen to his lap
she cant really talk right now
veronica slams down the receiver and pulls up a sleek leather address book
she severely scans through it
tossing it away veronica then descends into the sundry junk of her night table drawer and draws up another address book this one is frayed and pink polka dotted
she peruses it and dials
betty finn hits her ball through a wicket and squeals in delight
veronica has a motherly smile on her face
i dont believe it
dont get cocky girl
betty bends down to shoot then raises her body back up
i missed you
i know im not as as exciting as your other friends
betty once again bends and raises
ronnie im still a virgin
betty finally shoots
betty your daydreams are a lot better than my realities believe me
im afraid though its time to get your butt kicked
veoncia gigglingly shoots but misses the wicket
and instead hits bettys ball
disturbed by the sudden dilemma she determinedly walks to her ball and moves it away from bettys
hey youre not settling for the two shots are you
knock me out girl
its the only way
its not my style okay
nice guys finish last
i should know
veronica sighs then knocks bettys adjacent ball sailing toward the porch and a statuesque heather duke who does not budge as the ball whizzes past her
brav nervously ive got to get going veronica
see you at the studio
heather duke walks toward the girls followed by a meandering desultory heather mcnamara who picks up a green mallet and fragilely swings it her early robustness a forgotten memory
croquet wont be the same without heather
heather duke hustles back toward a passing betty finn
oh betty wait
i almost forgot
the whitney james teenage suicide prevention t
special isnt going to be taped at the studios
its going to be done in the park
but i thought
heading back its going to be like a big picnic
bring some potato salad
hey im red
heather dukes red ball slams into heather mcnamaras green one
so did you call people to tell them how to get to the studio tonight
heather duke savagely sends heather macnamaras ball into the flower bed
i called everyone even that stoner slut
felt like giving my phone a bath
i told betty just now
heather dukes shot swerves wide of the wicket
youre so polluted
talking down to people making fake notes
veronica blows her shot
i dont see what gives you the right to lecture ronnie you were soulmates with betty finn until you realized youre the cover of seventeen magazine and shes the before
half of a scarsdale diet ad
heather duke bashes her ball into veronicas and prepares to send it
some people just dont matter
why should those who do carry their weight
am i right
as heather duke swings down her mallet veronica steps on her own ball
when heather dukes mallet makes contact the two balls slam against each other unmoving with a loud smack
no youre wrong
its not even your turn
the depressed and disoriented heather mcnamara laying against a tree pipes in
boy croquets not the same without heather
in a sleek wetc station hallway veronica sawyer a guest pass affixed to her heart holds her hand in a spurting drinking fountain
she watches the water splash her car lighter burn mark
ich luge bullets
im such a jerk
peter dawson beams toward her wearing a guest pass
veronica i thought we lost you
i was waiting for my friend betty
veronica looks at her watch then joins peters march down the hall
teens talking it out on t
would it be pretentious of me to attach a videocassette of the show on my princeton application
shucks thats a great idea pete
they burst through the studio double doors
veronica and peter take in a panorama of attractive clean cut students from various schools chatting near wine and cheese tables set up to the side of an impressive elevated
all students are wearing pink armbands
this is excellent but i thought we were going to get equal representation on this thind geeks gearheads
out of nowhere a bubbling heather duke knots a pink armband around peters arm with a giggle
theyre probably just being fashionably late
peter dawson prances off with a raucous laugh
veronica stares dumbfounded at the wicked homogeneity of the students as heather duke ties a pink armband on her
is this very or what
oh youve gotta meet whitney james
heather duke tugs veronica across the crowded studio floor to where the wetc news set is situated
smoking casually in her anchors chair is the beautiful whitney james
whitney heres my friend
ah please sit down
heather duke glides away
veronica uncomfortably steps onto the news set and moves down next to whitney james
i got a confession to make
my name used to be heather too
but my names not
people just dont take the name heather seriously
they should shouldnt they
heather mcnamara surreptitiously picks up a bottle of wine and with a sad expression proceeds to down it
veronica apologizes to a blissfully oblivious whitney james
im so sorry
i was led to believe there were going to be different kinds of social and psychological types at this gathering
oh i was scared of the same thing heather
the minute you try to deal with the actual teenagers who have contemplated suicide youre stepping into quicksand
quicksand filled with bad complexions bad grades bad parents bad drugs and all sorts of doody nobody wants to hear let alone bend down to clean up
whitney james tears open a bag of corn nuts and showers some into her mouth
she speaks as she sucks and chews
im not knocking teen suicide
its exciting stuff
my personal faves are those kids from loaded families grabbing the mike to whine how even though they bagged a b
on their birthday theyre still quote unquote depressed
people who say money cant buy happiness dont know where to shop
whitney james titters
veronica is a statue of mortification
in the neighborhood park gloomy members of various cliques sit in silence at picnic tables
all are ludicrously wearing guest passes
betty finn mumbles down to her potato salad
earl frazier stoically stares off into space
heavy metaler clyde holds an absurdly large picnic basket
what the fuck
completely flabbergasted veronica manages a light tone
the world wants winners i guess
not people stained with loserness
stained with loserness
oh i like it
can i use that
itd be dynamite on interoffice memoranda
its all yours heather
now if youll excuse me im going to go throw up
sickened veronica stumbles onto the studio floor
studio lights suddenly pop on momentarily blinding her
pauline grabs veronica by the arm and shouts into the air
everyone take their places on the stage
to veronica isnt this thrilling
fleming its just not right
what the wine
i realize youre all under but it seemed like such a perfect touch
shouting upward could we get some more light up here
the pink armbanded aryan youths form a circle on the circular stage
pauline moves to a microphone at the center stage beside a seated whitney james whos tuning her electric guitar
veronica helplessly stands between the circle of students and the two female hosts as the cameras go on
pauline sings speaks into the microphone while whitney james strums her guitar
our schools have been torn apart by tragedy
lets fuse them back together through love lets clasp hands and connect ourselves in one mighty circuit like a dove the students sthereally reach out to each other and clasp
veronica quivers for a moment then bursts through a handholding heather duke and heather mcnamara and off the stage
lets begin a new happiness
veronica swaggers past a seated technician
he pushes up a console lever causing the outer edge of the stage where the circle of hand holding students is to slowly spin around the singing pauline and the
strumming whitney james
with no more suicide
eeriely oh yeah
ripping off her pink armband veronica freezes
standing at the wine and cheese table gunslinger coat and all is j
he turns around and raises his wine glass for a gleeful toast
holy traumatic experiences batman
im sorry you felt you had to put yourself through all that shit
i told you it wouldnt
hey its in the past already right
no more problems
devastated veronica sways back toward the technicians console
veronica slams the lever back down forcing the spinning circle of handholding pink armbanded students to crash to the ground around a taken aback pauline and whitney james
whitney james playfully lets off a hendrixian riff before coolly leaning over to her microphone
lets go for another take
veronica bursts through the studio doors panting rapidly
she kicks off her shoes and begins to jog barefoot through the station hallway weaving through various reporter types
veronica pops out the studio door running faster
she sprints down the side of a road
her bare feet pound against sharp pebbles
veronica now barrels through the neighborhood park
she looks to her outcast classmates
in tableau they stare back
betty finn on a park carousel spins in and out of view
veronica speeds past the shops and the movie theatre
the viewer remains at the theatre ticket booth as martha dunnstock dumptruck wearing a bigfun t shirt pushes three dollars through the ticket window to a bored female cashier
bargain matinees are for the first show only
oh i forgot
martha puts two crumpled bucks through the window
the cashier shines a cruelly patronizing smile
veronica huffs and puffs into her family room where her mom and dad are watching t
hey veronica howd that teenage prevention t
suicide thing go
color me educated
i learned high school happiness is for members only pauline fleming wouldnt know reality if it lived in her uterus and realitys names heather james
s a major creep
i dont know what youre talking about honey but can it wait a bit
were watching this special program on teen problems
veronica half bitterly laughs at the irony
the light of the screen flickers on an overwhelmingly sullen martha
she moves her leg and knocks a large coke across the floor
she tragically stares at the cola pool
a dan rather voice booms from the t
the sawyers stare
oh sure ill bet even back when i went to school there were drugs even sex but they were simpler times
the sherwood suicides tell the bitter truth of todays young
what a waste
oh veronica snaps off the t
turn that back on
this condescending junk makes suicide seem like a cool thing to do
hey kids make your parents and teachers feel like shit
get the respect in death youll never get in life
if were not going to watch that program can i put on the game
are you trying to tell me it is not a troubled time for the nations youth
everybody cares for youth but nobody cares about joey blow
when that news reporter gets home hell scream at his son for not mowing the lawn in the right pattern
you dont get enough attention you get too much attention
which is it
where are your shoes
all we want is to be treated like human beings not like guinea pigs to be experimented on and not like bunny rabbits to be patronized
i dont patronize bunny rabbits
treated like human beings
is that what you said little miss voice of a generation
just how do you think adults act with other adults
you think its all just doubles tennis
adults can be horrible to other adults
when teenagers complain that they want to be treated like human beings its usually because they are being treated like human beings
veronica leans against the wall with a melancholy smile
i guess i picked the wrong time to be a human being
mom is embarassed for getting so involved
she meekly gestures to a tray of pate with a compassionate smile
want some pate
heather duke suddenly breezes in the room
hi everyone door was open
veronica you missed it
pauline and whitney james were up there doing there suicide rap when the cops come in and announce that martha dumptruck tried to buy the farm
she gave the ticket girl at the colfax theatre a suicide note then bellyflopped in front of a car
repulsed is she dead
thats the punchline
shes still alive in stable condition
another case of a geek trying to imitate the popular people of the school and failing miserably
is that pate
veronica slaps heather duke in the face
heather duke paces the room holding an icepack to her jaw
veronica is on the ground wiping off her bloodied feet
i said i was sorry
you are out of control
heather and kurt were a shock but martha dumptruck get crucial
she dialed suicide hotlines in her diapers
youre not funny
veronica rubs her feet
heather duks shakes her head
heather chandleresque what
understand martha couldnt take the heat so she got out of the kitchen
just think what a better place the world would be if every nimrod followed her cue
just shut up and turn on the radio
hot probs is on
oh shit yeah
heather duke hastens to the radio and flicks it on
ripping open a bag of corn nuts she sets herself down next to veronica as a troubled male voice cuts the air
troubled male voice radio i know its supposed to be funny that they never get off the island but still sometimes i feel like im on that island and gilligan
can be just so stupid sometimes
this sounds like a good one
a slob d
cackles into a w
conference call type box
dude youve got to remember if it wasnt for the courage of the fearless crew the minnow would be lost
the minnow would be lost
but skipper hates me
rudely clicks off the troubled male voice
whoa theyre coming out early tonight
what ever happened to teen pregnancy and acne
youve got the dogcatcher on w etcetera and youre listening to hot probs
who am i talking to
heather mcnamara is sitting clandestinely on her bedroom floor talking on the phone and through her radio
a dim minnie mouse lamp provides the rooms only light
my name is heather i mean not heather
heather mcnamara looks up at a madonna poster on the wall
geez no not that
heather mcnamara looks up to her minnie mouse lamp
veronica and heather duke simultaneously move into stunned kneeling positions half realizing who the caller is
radio hey babe i need a name
looks to the conference call box with exasperation
heather mcnamara box my name is minnie
dont tell me mickey just confessed he got a
from goofy at a new years eve party
a broken down heather mcnamara sobs
god has cursed me i think
the last time i had sex the guy killed himself the next day
im failing math
heather duke excitedlly jumps up as heather mcnamara drones on
heather duke heather mcnamara radio holy shit thats my whole life is a mess
well i was supposed to be crucify her
captain of the cheerleading team but i probably wont veronica because i miss practice when oh man she knows we my dad visits
my parents listen to this show
are divorced and stuff and
a blackboard reads poor little heather
heather told everyone about heather
heather mcnamara is revealed in the front row wearing her cheerleader uniform
to the left heather duke dishes with some dreamy guys
at the back of the classroom veronica monocle in eye writes in her diary
yes dear diary ive cut off heather chandlers head and heather dukes head has sprouted in its place like some mythological thing my eighth grade boyfriend would know about
heathers even doing the old note trick
a homely girl is seen reading a note glancing to a typical jock
veronica takes in the wicked panorama of the classroom
i did it j
i did it paulines way
i guess thats heathers way
and jesus what about j
i cant get him out of my head
are we going to the prom
or to hell
and wheres heather going
heather mcnamara suddenly rises and walks out of the classroom passing a gruff teacher in a trenchcoat carrying a briefcase
wheres heather going
shes going to cry y y heather mcnamara struggles to open a bottle of sleeping pills
fucking child protector caps
gruff teacher writes a math problem on the board
a flustered veronica squirms in her seat then leaps up and runs to the door
now wheres she going
is somebody getting raped today on all my children or what
the bottle is smashed open
a palmful of pills is poured out
veronica races down the hall
heather mcnamara is a chipmunk with a mouthful of pills
she pulls a glass from her purse and turns on a faucet but no water comes out
she manages to mumble
give me a break
heather mcnamara gets running water from another sink as veronica rushes in
veronica punches heather mcnamaras face causing the pills to explode out of her mouth
heather mcnamara slumps against a stall onto the floor
what are you trying to do
veronica jumps up and down on the pills on the floor
what were you trying to do
suicide is a private thing
veronica lunges forward to strike her
heather mcnamara recoils with a wail
half regaining her composure veronica slides down next to heather mcnamara
youre giving your life away to become a goddamn statistic in u
fucking a today
thats got to be the least private thing i can think of
but what about heather and ram and kurt
if everyone jumped off a bridge young lady would you
heather mcnamara wipes tears from her eyes and smiles weakly
hey now if you were happy every day of your life you wouldnt be a human being youd be a game show host
lets knock off early
go to the mall
something lame like that
comfortably slouched at a desk j
so its come to this
turning to the viewer heather chandler did polls
i want you to do a petition as a favor as the favor
do you know the group big fun
heather duke sits at the desk opposite him torching the manilla envelopes photographs with a butane lighter
post chortle some teenybopper rag says big fun wants to play a prom
it could be westerburgs if we can get everyones john hancock
flips across a stack of blank connected computer printout sheets
at the top is a small paragraph and the word petition
heather duke blows ashes off her desk and grabs it giggling
ill get right on it coach
and hey a little gift
i wont be needing it
heather duke twirls her copy of catcher in the rye to a pleased j
heather duke gothically ascends a staircase holding the petition
she stops arms raised high to bathe in the sunlight blasting through the staircase window
heather duke petition in hand sashays toward the country club kids table
here comes heather
heather duke chirps to a schoolbusful of various students
the provocatively dressed petitioner charms a bleacher of jocks
heather duke continues to bizarrely bathe in the sunlight of the staircase window
now in heavy metal gear heather duke slams down the petition atop a booth of metalheads
decked out in denim heather duke vanishes into the stoner hallway smoke with the petition
heather duke further writhes in the sunlight until veronicas perplexed voice cuts into her bliss
heather duke brings down her arms and the petition and turns to veronica revealed to be descending down the steps
color me stoked girl
ive gotten everyone to sign this petition even the one who think bigfun are tuneless eurofags
people love me
giggling my god you havent signed
people love you but i know you
jennifer forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria
and doug hylton
verbally winking so some people need different kinds of convincing than others
happiness evaporating hey just sign the petition
dont talk to me like that
it was j
he made out the signature sheet and everything
now will you sign it
veronica slaps heather duke with all her might
heather why cant you just be a friend
why are you such a megabitch
because i can be
the same fucking cheek goddamnit
why are you pulling my dick
do you think do you really think if betty finns fairy godmother made her cool shed still act nice and hang with her dweebette friends
heather duke stumbles down the stairs
s voice cuts into veronicas concentration
wanna go out tonight
veronica grimly turns to see a smirking descending j
catch a movie
jokingly but caustically i was thinking more along the lines of slitting heather dukes wrists open and making it look like a suicide
i could be up for that
ive already started underlining meaningful passages in heathers copy of catcher in the rye if you know what i mean
so are we on
veronica somberly steps forward to j
grabs his elbows then pulls him gently seemingly for a kiss
she spits in his face and bolts down the stairs calling up to him
its over j
i dont get it
you were wrong
i was right
intensely clutching her schoolbooks veronica walks through the front door into the living room where mom and dad sit with aggressively compassionate faces
veronica is a bit confused
mom and dad glance at each other before mom speaks
your friend jason dean just stopped by
he seemed very concerned about you
he said he thinks you might try to kill yourself
you have been depressed lately
oh he said this is for you
dad holds out an envelope
veronica nabs it and rips it open
the note reads in feminine manuscript recognize the handwriting
oh my god
veronica runs off her mothers voice trailing behind her
he says we should keep you away from sharp objects closed garages toxic
veronica vaults through her bedroom door
a barbie doll wearing a bigfun t shirt hangs from a noose
with a whimper she swerves away from it and dives onto her bed
laconically leans against his motorcycle with his legs suavely crossed
he looks up to veronicas bedroom window and hears another whimper emerge
he puts a cigarette in his mouth and lights it with a smile
veronica curls into a fetal position on her bed and closes her eyes
tighter and tighter as j
you cant ever find a place nice and peaceful because there isnt any
veronica flops around to see j
kneeling over her on her bed reading heather dukes copy of the catcher in the rye
its got that catcher in the ryey i hate the world and the world hates me so lets commit suicide ambience
give it a try underline something
giddily underlines words then slides into a prone position tossing the book to an enraged veronica
get off my bed you sick psycho
you think youre a rebel
youre not a rebel
youre a sick psycho
do you think youre a rebel
do you think youre a rebel
i wanna know
you say tomayto i say tomahto
lets call the whole thing off
veronica freezes and j
reaches up to her hand where she holds the catcher in the rye
her index finger is curled into the book
sitting up j
carefully opens the book at that place and peers in
look at that
i love it
i usually go for whole sentences myself but hey this is perfecto
youre not listening
im not on your side
obliviously underlines the word then pulls the flailing veronica up like an enthusiastic camp counselor
the sound of a lock being jimmied is heard moments before veronica and j
burst through the door
moves to the dishwasher and opens it like a burglar opening a safe
youre still not listening
pulling out the knife nag nag nag nag
taking the knife from him this knife is filthy
what in the hell do you think im doing
taking out her tonsils
i think i know heather a bit better than you okay
if she was going to slash her wrists the knife would be absolutely spotless
grabs a dishtowel and vigorously wipes off the knife
can you see your fucking reflection
she can and so can the viewer
tears well in veronicas eyes
she begins to shudder a shattered smile quaking on her face
tomorrow someone else will move into her place
that person could be me
suddenly deliriously defiant ha theres only one of us who knows heathers handwriting and if you think im doing another suicide note
laughing you dont get it do you
society nods its head at any horror the american teenager can think to bring upon itself
we dont need gloves and does anyone really care about exact handwriting
tears his gloves off with a giggle
he takes a pen from the kitchen counter and paper from a cutesy memo pad
he shoves the pen in veronicas hand and grabbing her hand forces her to scribble life sucks on the paper
man ive even got a marked up catcher in the rye
what else does a suicide need
pulls out the copy of the catcher in the rye and opens a door revealing heather duke asleep in an artful pose on a couch mtv images from the t
flashing against her
raising the knife if youll excuse me
hops in the adjoinging room and slams the door
veronica races to the door wailing
she maniacally rattles the doorknob trying to open the locked door
the sound of the rattling doorknob subtly turns into wild african music thundering on the soundtrack as whitney james in a t
screen maniacally addresses the viewer
a shiny number flashes on and off in the corner
in speeded up imagery dennis peter and the yearbook girl manuever pictures of heather chandler kurt ram and heather duke in mind bogglingly countless ways in order to accomodate them
all on the same two page layout
with even more speeded up imagery four students wearing what a waste oh the humanity t shirts toss out tons of black armbands into a hungry crowd
the wild african music and the speeded up imagery slams to a halt at the sigh of heather duke lying serenely in a coffin
father faust wearing dark sunglasses and a terrifying toupee walks in front of her to address a sizable group of adults and students sitting in foldout chairs before him
father faust dramatically looks over the crowd before finally speaking
father ripper lets the word hang in the air then holds up the copy of the catcher in the rye
heather duke underlined a lot of things in this copy of the catcher in the rye but i believe the word eskimo underlined all by itself is the key to
understanding heathers pain
veronica stands in a corner with an oh brother look on her face
on the surface heather duke was the vivacious young lady we all knew her to be
but her soul was in antartica freezing with the knowledge of the way fellow teenagers can be cruel the way parents can be unresponsive and as she writes so eloquently
in her suicide note the way life can suck
well all miss sherwoods little eskimo
lets hope shes rubbing noses with jesus
moves next to veronica holding a plate of steaming spaghetti
she is wearing nerdy glasses and something that looks like an intergalactic prison unifrom
is this turnout weak or what
i had at least seventy more people at my funeral
oh god veronica my afterlife is s o o boring
if i have to sing kumbaya one more time
what are you doing here
i made your favorite
lots of oregano
with a squeal heather chandler plunges veronicas face into the plate of spaghetti
uncurling from the fetal position that she had fallen asleep in veronicas tightly closed eyes snap open in a sweat as her mothers voice continues to filter through the door
its all been a dream
veronica closes her eyes and holds her heart
she suddenly launches to her desk opens her diary shoves on her monocle catches her breath and begins writing
dear diary no one can stop j
not the f
or the p
that is to say no one but me
i know where j
is coming from and where he is heading
hes wrong but im going to teach him whats right
im going to stop j
if its the last thing i do
veronica leans back in her chair sweating
she reaches in the pocket of a blazer draped over the back of the chair and pulls out the cigarette j
had given her eariler in the film
she puts it in her mouth unlit then takes it out and puts it back in the blazer
remains laconically leaning against his motorcycle with his legs suavely crossed as he was before veronica began dreaming
finishes his cigarette and pulls out a gun
he checks the bullets puts the gun back in his coat and heads toward the house
veronica hugs j
the cat then rips down the hanging barbie
leans a ladder against the sawyer house
mom sets down three plates of spaghetti
dad watches on
does she want a written invitation
yelling upward veronica
crawls through veronicas window
hanging from the rafter neck in a noose of bedshoots is veronica
mom sets a glass of milk at veronicas place distressed
paces the room sweating and ranting waving a gun in one hand the barbie doll in the other
i cant believe you did it
i was teasing
i loved you
sure i climbed up here to kill you but first i was going to try and get you back
with amazing petition
throws the gun on the bed and pulls from his coat the computer printout sheet petition then savagely rolls it out on the floor
it is filled with signatures of different sizes styles and colors
its a shame you cant see what our fellow students really signed
flicks open a switchblade
he runs the blade beneath the typed paragraph at the top causing it to peel off reavealing another typed paragraph
we students of westerburg high will die
our burning bodies will be the ultimate protest to a society that degrades is
fuck you all
not that subtle but neithers blowing up the school
talk about your suicide pacts
when our school explodes tomorrow its going to be the kind of thing that infects a generation
a woodstock for the s
damn we coulda toasted marshmallows together
honey are you all right in there
swiftly picks up the petition and heads out the window
mom enters the room and seeing her hanging daughter launches into frantic screams
oh god i knew it
i want my baby back
i should have let you keep that job at the mall
i was just afraid of you coming home alone at night
veronica opens her eyes
i made your favorite
lots of oregano
veronica undos the noose around her neck but still remains hanging for the rope runs all the way down her back beneath her blazer and is tied around her waist
she undos the waist knot and lands on her bed
she quickly puts a small pillow over the left behind gun unnoticed by her dazed mom
hey mom why so tense
montage music plays as veronica rears up from her dinner plate to see her stonefaced parents and her cat staring at her
tools with a bomb at his desk
a knock on the door
turns down his stereo and the montage music
i need some help with my homework
sorry tiger im a little busy
turns back up his stereo and the montage music
the montage music continues as school buses arrive in front of the school
students pour out
students come out of their cars
typically hectic start of another day opening and slamming of locker action
veronica darts through the thoroughfare to her locker
a passing pauline fleming screeches to a halt grabbing veronica as she chokes on some styrofoam cup coffee
told me you committed suicide last night
where is he
we have to talk
whether to kill yourself is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make
get a job
veronica storms away to her nearby locker
she swirls her locker combination and opens it
she glances down the hall and freezes
in the distance j
moves mechanically down the hallway carrying a large gym bag wearing a walkman
veronica climbs into her locker
she closes it until it is barely perceptibly ajar
strides past the locker and into the boys bathroom
d smoothly moves into a stall and closes the door
he turns off his walkman and ends the montage music
the hallway slowly clears as students go to class
the bell rings
a late student races through the empty hallway
veronica carefully hatches out of her locker
she treads down the hallway as if something were about to jump out at her
a group of cheerleaders including heather mcnamara are lazily doing cartwheels on the gym floor
on a small stage set up beside them other students are putting up folding chairs
principal gowan says testing into a microphone
toting the gym bag quietly opens the gym door and slips inside
he swiftly moves unnoticed to a position underneath the bleachers
veronica peers around a corner to see an empty hallway
using heavy black masking tape j
tapes a thermal bomb to a steel support beneath the bleachers
other thermal bombs can be discerned taped to other supports
veronica cautiously treads down the empty hallway trying to keep in control
suddenly packs of students burst from classroom doors behind veronica
the excited swarms of students move toward and past veronica who has braked her troubled treading to stiffly contemplate her passing peers
she latches onto geek rodney in a panic
rodney looks down at his clutched arm with a nervous smile
rodney wheres everybody going
oh my god the damn pep assembly
yeah these things are pretty artificial but at least we all get out of class
veronica ignores rodneys amiable attemots at conversation to inquisitively move forward through the crowd
darts from out underneath the bleachers to the gym doors
he pops the doors open and sees the crowd of students move toward the gym
he suavely pauses then dashes down a nearby set of stairs
veronica continues to tensely surf the tidal wave of students heading for the gymnasium
she stops to watch her classmates file into the gym like lemmings with increasing sense of dread
she again latches onto a passing rodney
rodney whats underneath the gym
rodney unconsciously dramatically stops turns to veronica
the boiler room
veronica blanches then lunges through the crowd
she topples a couple disgruntled students before careening down the staircase beside the gym
walks by the firm glass windows of the boiler room eyeing the pounding generators inside
he stops at a heavy steel door
placing down his gym bag j
proceeds to swiftly pick the lock
he swings open the steel door
may i see your hall pass
a sweating veronica moves toward him pointing the bedroom gun at him
i knew that loose was too noose
i mean noose too loose
like father like son
a serious as fuck bomb in the boiler room thatll set off a pack of thermals upstairs
okay so lets start by slowly putting the bomb down on the ground
looks down at the gym bag already on the ground
he folds his arms and smiles
veronica forcefully moves closer
i knew that
i knew that
put your hands on your head
you didnt say simon says
suddenly kicks out into veronicas stomach doubling her over and causing her to drop the gun
gracefully retrieves it
the pep assembly is in full swing with rowdy students in the bleachers earthily shouting giggling cheerleaders making swaying pyramids valiant band members struggling to be heard
various jocks including earl stand on the stage with principal gowan as a yearbook photographer flashes away
veronica bends over quivering and clutching her bruised ribs
raises the gun to her head
live by the sword
veronica swings her left arm up knocking j
s gun hand upward
she then sails her right fist into his face
the blow annoys him more than it hurts him but j
s momentary loss of composure allows veronica to come in with another much harder right hook
the blow sends j
stumbling back against the boiler room jarring the gun loose
they simultaneously lunge for the gun
veronica having the better grip pulls so forecfully that after wrenching the gun from j
she loses control of it flinging it down the hall
veronica pops up to retrieve it but j
moves his legs scissors style around her and trips her
the assembly mindlessly blares on
cheerleader heather mcnamara rah rah rahs
rodney and the other geeks pass around a pair of opera glasses all intensely scoping out the cheerleaders
a group of stoners toke away beneath the bleachers one of them lackadaisically leaning against a thermal bomb
a snarling j
stands up pulling veronica with him
you think just because you started this thing you can end it
violently kisses bites veronica
while kissing veronica sees a fire alarm on a nearby wall
she closes her eyes then savagely knees j
in the groin
veronica bolts to the alarm and pulls it down
you really didnt think id forget forget to disconnect the
veronica rockets her body down and picks up the gun
grabs her and throws her against the steel boiler room door
a jostled veronica raises the gun
howls then bounds toward veronica causing them both to careen down the steel steps of the boiler room
at the same time he inadvertently kicks the gym bag bomb down along with them
the gun spins from veronicas hand and slides away
the bomb flies out of the bag onto the boiler room floor
a digital clock on the bomb clicks on at
the frenzied pep assembly crowd is now doing the wave
betty finn and her similar co horts deliriously get into the act all sit in a circle at the bottom rows of the bleachers pouting as students bounce up and
down around them
earl and the other jocks stand on the stage grinning and preening before the crowd
veronica and j
are in a heap at the bottom of the boiler room steps
veronica faintly works into a semi sitting position and gives an astonished glance to the bomb its digital clock clicking to
veronica crawls to the gun and levels it at a rousing up j
the bombs gone on j
how do you turn it off
fully standing j
flicks open his switchblade
he gives veronica the finger screaming in exploded saliva
seething veronica shoots up at j
blowing off the finger
shrieking in pain j
drops the knife to hold this sudden geyser of blood
veronica achingly stands pointing the gun
the bomb clicks down to
its all over j
help me to stop it
you want to wipe the slate clean as much as i do
okay so maybe i am killing everyone in the school because nobody loves me
you have a purpose though
lets face it the only place different social types can genuinely get along with each other is in heaven
veronica fires the gun at j
the bomb clicks to
how do you turn the fucker off
youre not listening
people are going to look at the ashes of westerburg and say theres a school that self destructed not because society didnt care but because that school was society
is that deep or what
ill let you put it in your diary babe
free of charge
the bomb asshole
just push the red button twice
thats what stops it
if thats what you want babe
you know what i want babe
veronica fires the gun twice into j
coughing and moaning he splatters against a generator
cool guys like you out of my life
veronica saunters to j
s writhing body
but babe dont worry these here were ich luge bullets
closes his eyes and slumps to the ground
veronica turns to the bomb and crouches over it
a lit green light is next to a green button
above it an unlit red light is next to a red button
the bombs digital clock clicks to
veronica presses the red button twice turning on the red light and stopping the clock
veronica falls back into a sitting position and sorely exhales tears streaming down her face
a cheerleader does a cartwheel in slow motion as eerie music plays
the manic crowd in the bleachers vibrates in slow motion as well
at normal speed veronica walks to the doors of the gym and peers in
the panorama of roaring students posing jocks and prancing cheerleaders continues to unfold in slow motion
veronica walks away from the gym
veronica wearily pushes open the front door and emerges outside of the school
she closes her eyes to therapeutically bask in the suns rays
a slight smile trembles onto her face
a strange voice kills it
color me impressed
stands starkly in the distance before her blood spurting from his throat onto his gunslinger coat
he painfully speaks through his assasinated vocal cords
you really fucked me up veronica
vertigo city i thought i
youve got power veronica
power i didnt think you had
the slate is clean
pulls open his coat revealing that the bomb is attached to his torso
the green light is on and the clock says
pretend i did blow up the school
all the schools
now that youre dead what are you gonna do with your life
veronica takes the unlit cigrette from her blazer pocket and puts it in her mouth
she then folsd her arms
raises his arms in a crucifixion pose as the bomb clicks to
an annoyed j
breaks out of his crucifixion stance and raps the bomb with his palm
the sound of the bomb explosion plunges the cheering up and down pep assembly into chaos
wailing students pour out of the bleachers screaming less out of fear than a whoa dude sense of excitement
veronica stands in the same position in front of the school with her arms still folded
only now her cigarette is lit and her face and clothes are blackened in ash
flames flicker in bushes behind her
veronica drags on the cigarette and turns to go inside
veronica strolls into the school and into a hallway of howling students some of whom are tearing down prom banners for the thrill of it
heather duke rushes up to veronica and grimaces
veronica you look like hell
yeah i just got back
veronica tosses away the cigarette
she then grabs heather duke by the shoulders and forcibly turns her around
what are you doing
heather my love theres a new sheriff in town
veronica takes off heather dukes red ribbon and ties it around the hair of her own head
she kisses heather duke on the cheek leaving a black stain
veronica calls off
hey martha wait up
martha dunnstock dumptruck revealed to be in an electric wheelchair brakes to a stop and looks to veronica confused
veronica walks up beside her
martha starts up her wheelchair and accompanies veronica away into a deserted hallway
my date for the prom kind of flaked out on me so i thought if you werent doing anything that night we could go to the video store and rent
some new releases or something
maybe pop some popcorn
id like that
so would i
veronica and martha continue gliding down the hall bogart rains style
