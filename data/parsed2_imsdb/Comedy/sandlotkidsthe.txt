written by david mickey evans robert gunter june th of the best year old buddies that ever lived
on a makeshift baseball diamond a sandlot
circa scotty smalls studious looking alan yeah yeah mcclennan little hyper hamilton ham porter tubby with a huge smile kenny denunez handsome bean pole tommy repeat timmons and his brother
timmy bertram grover weeks wearing inch thick horn rims jeff squints palledorous a transistor radio plug wedged in his ear and benny rodriguez leaning on scottys shoulder sporting the worlds all time hottest sneakers
one palm up together like the musketeers theyre holding forward a baseball
with a mysterious smudge
everyones got that one summer when they were a kid
a summer so perfect that it stays with them forever
it stays caught in time like camelot
pause that summer is like a book with a million blank pages that you get to fill with the greatest story you could ever dream up
this is a story about a legend
and for us that summer was the one when the legend got made
we close in tight on the black smudge which becomes george washington crossing the delaware
daniel boone in frontier buckskins
abe lincoln giving the gettysburg address
frederick douglas orating from a podium
sitting bull in his splendor
the wright brothers at kitty hawk this photo blends to news reel stock footage of the actual launch
the following also blend to stock joe louis clobbering max schmelling
jesse owens in the olympics
albert einstein scrawling on a chalkboard
charles lindberg and his spirit of st
louis land in paris
as the waiting throngs cheer everybody sometime in their life has met a real live hero
theyre not exactly a dime a dozen but theres plenty of people whove done real great things
but hardly anyone has ever met a certified legend because most of them are dead before they get voted one
chuck yeager in the x breaking the sound barrier
macarthur stepping ashore pipe clenched
jim thorpe playing football
elvis presely on stage in hep cat duds
neil armstrong setting foot on the moon
so to actually be there at the moment one gets made
well forget about it
it never happens
to understand how it all got started you have to go back
we pull back from the moon like a baseball in the sky
to the all time hands down complete and undisputed legend that ever lived
a baseball in someones hand
we pull back from it
in any language in any country in any world
the sultan of swat
the king of clout
the great bambino
you have to go back to
babe ruth is holding the baseball
theres never been anyone greater than the babe
and when he called his famous full count homerun in the world series he made sure hed live forever
hits a homerun
settles into his signature locomotive basepath chug
and its a good thing he became immortal because without him what happened that summer absolutely never wouldve happened
weird thing was before i moved to the neighborhood i had no idea who he was
and he played a game i knew nothing about
send up chalky dust at each step
his foot hits home plate taking us years into the future
the babes antiquated leather cleat becomes
the cleat of basepath speedster maury wills
fourteen years later after the babe was gone there was another guy who had something to do with the legend getting made too
a guy who set a record that summer that was so awesome some people still dont believe it
so fast that no one knows hes gone
the pitcher fires to rd
the rd baseman gloves the dirt
the umpire wings the air
wills cleat becomes the p
flyer sneaker of
benny rodriguez as he steps up to the plate
cranks one deep to right
he tears around the bases like lightning this kid is real fast
he rounds rd
the ball comes in home cutting him off
hes caught in a pickle
yeah yeah ham denunez repeat timmy bertram and squints come unglued and crowd the basepath
pickles the catcher and rd baseman
he feints n rubba legs them out of position
he sprints for home
just as he crosses home plate pulls his transistor radio ear plug out
maury wills just stole number thirty one
throws their gloves different ways in disgust
cant beat that guy
ya dufuses whyd ya get him in a pickle for
ya know hes the damn pickle king
rubba legs for sure
truly rubba legs
they imitate the big leaguers skinning five spittin zooka chaw juice
yeah yeah hands benny his glove
squints jots the stats in his pee chee folder
murderers row remains undefeated
we never got our ups
the lunch bell rings
the gang heads across the playground back to the bungalows
all your moms wear boxers
without looking back eight birds hit the air
nervous has been watching nearby
just as ham squints and benny go for the spigots yeah yeah taps each rapidfire milk milk pee
great im dyin a thirst and you pee me out
ham it aint really
then switch with me
do i look stupid
everyone drinks from the un cursed spigots
as they turn to leave scotty goes for the fountain
the guys hang waiting for doom
scotty drinks from the pee spigot
the guys gag and faux barf
scotty has no idea why theyre laughing at him
i moved to the neighborhood about a month before school let out
i was from another state and didnt have a single friend in a thousand miles
benny ham scotty sitting by himself and the other students are clock watching
the bell rings
the classroom empties
papers circle to the floor from departing cyclones
streams of excited kids spill into the corridors a river of scrambling tennis shoes and clashing lunch boxes at the entrance gate
caught in the mayhem
the guys forging ahead
he follows them
it was a lousy way to end up the th grade cause i had zip time to make friends before summer
and thats about where it all started
scotty sneaks close around some dense bushes clutching books and john glenn freedom lunchbox
he steps through the barrier a secret doorway in the fence onto the distant the gangs homemade baseball diamond
theyre with broken brooms
with halves of tools
with a holed box of detergent powder
of leaves trash and sticks
in left field painted green and lettered the green monster
maintains cover and a row of houses whose backyards are all chain link fenced
the fencing is trimmed individually in wood bamboo etc
one has the worlds coolest treehouse
next to it
is the last house
this owner has cordoned his backyard tall panels of that green tropical look privacy fiberglass lashed to the fence
remains undercover but hes bustin to join in
never notices him
as they work fifth grades history man
a hundred days man
a hundred days of baseball
all day everyday as much as we can
thats the best
we got all summer
we got all summer
the guys round up in the infield
as they play catch they spread farther and farther apart
until theyve each taken up the position they most like to play
they fit the paltry little diamond scrappy happy kids
tract homes everybodys got a different thing going in the front yard
the guys sans timmons split up toward their homes slappin gloves so longing for the night
everyone but the timmons twins lived on my new block
scotty shuttling moving boxes to his garage watches them go
they lived in a house by the sandlot and had the worlds greatest tree house because their dad was a contractor
benny is the last to go in
he sees scotty watching
so he nods
just a little
clears to empty
the street lamps arc on drawing soft white circles on the sidewalks
from this height they look like baseballs dotting the neighborhood
even before i knew any of them i envied that tree house
a shrine to the pastime
pennants magazine pictures game programs baseball cards a whole section of maury wills radiating from a picture of wills caught in a pickle
later it would become second only to cape canaveral as a command post for history
when i moved in that summer id never played baseball but it wasnt too tough figuring out who these guys heroes were
so after a week of watching
i figured baseball seemed like the best way to get in with them
in bed oiling his glove staring out his window at scottys house
taped to his footboard is the most important picture of all
a picture of the babe
heath kit gadgets
an unbelievable erector set contraption with little motors and stuff
an autographed picture of mr
scottys pjd at his erector set table bothered and unhappy
this stuff is too damn easy for him
he whips on a last bolt and connects the itty bitty motor
a tiny scoopelvator snatches up a white marble
drops it on a roller coaster track
the marble whips around corners and loop da loops
lands in a mini catapult
another motor draws it back via a winding string
boy scout camping knife scissors ratchet in snip the string the catapult fires
leaps a little green fence and wonk
beans right in the forehead
scotty winces at the shot
i thought we agreed wed take this apart
and not spend so much time in here
i know but its just nighttime
scotty have you made any friends yet
why not honey
cause im still new
honey i dont want you sitting in here all summer fiddling with this stuff like you did last summer
and the one before that
scotty look at me
i know youre smart and im proud of you
but you have to get outside you have to
she sits across from him trying to get through
i want you to get out in the fresh air and make friends
run around and scrape your knees
climb trees and hop fences
get in trouble for crying out loud
not too much but some
you have my permission
now how many mothers do you think say that to their sons
none mothers i guess
i want you to make friends this summer scotty
lots of them
i know but i dont im no good at anything
face it mom im just an and youll always be just an egghead with an attitude like that
so promise me alright
maybe tomorrow youll make some friends
yeah maybe tomorrow
do you think bill i mean dad will teach me to play catch
are you kidding hed love it you know what an athlete he wasin high school
you know what a pitcher he was in high college
scotty slurps a glass of chocolate quick
rinses the glass too carefully
gathers courage for something
breathes deep starts across the house
scotty peeks through a slightly open door
bill moves around inside unpacking boxes
scotty reaches to knock
almost walks away
then musters the gumption
scotty takes a few cautious steps into
a trophy room
ribbons plaques trophies
bill mustve been some athlete but he limps now
gathering more courage
my real dad died when i was just a little kid
my mom married bill a year before we moved to the neighborhood
at the time he and i were still getting used to each other
um dad sorry i mean bill remember you promised youd teach me to play catch
he dusts a batting trophy
well could you teach me
he places a pitching plaque
scotty waits awkwardly
waits for more words
they dont come
scotty leaves bringing the door with him on his way out
through the cracked portal he sees bill set a silver pedestal on the main shelf
on this he sets a baseball
just a baseball
scotty wakes up
checks his theme clock
he bolts out of bed
dashes through the house to the front door
throws it open and runs down to
fan sprinklers water all the lawns
way far down the block ham at the helms bakery truck buying a donut then scrambling around the far corner
hey hey come on
wait up wait up
runs back inside and
strips off his cowboy pjs
digs through his finding a vinyl toy baseball glove
its still in the package with a note attached to scotty boy love grandma
its all hes got
he shovels through a pair of mickey mouse ears a cowboy hat finds the closest thing hes got to a baseball cap
a long duck billed fishing cap with a big embroidered trout
scotty runs by soon familiar places where he slows momentarily envious of the crisply uniformed kids
moving on down whose backyards we already know
scotty flat out stops at with the fiberglass panels out back
scotty slips quietly through the secret fence doorway emerging where he hugs the perimeter moving slowly toward the sandlot common houses
winded scotty finds already playing over the line
they never kept score
they never chose sides
they never even really stopped playing the game
it just went on forever
everyday they picked up right where they left off the day before
it was an endless dream game
there was only of them so they didnt have a whole team
it didnt matter though
benny was so good he took everyones position when it was there ups
i didnt know any of that then
i just knew they were having the time of their lives and i wanted to be a part of it
watches and listens as he goes to the sharp satisfying sound of the hardball snapping cleanly in the oily leather of their gloves
his own toy glove
continues around the perimeter trying to be seen and become invisible
he goes unwittingly closer to those green fiberglass panels
winds up and pitches to who connects big
come too close to the green fence
something has overcome him
he stares with serious woollies at and sees only dust rising in time with some great sounds of exhalation
and then before he can draw any conclusions
whips a look up and sees coming right at him
tracks it frozen stiff
at the past possible moment he throws his arms over his face and ducks
beans him at the glove covering his noggin
hits his butt
the ball rolls a bit
comes to an i dare you stop right up against the diseased fiberglass panels of that preternatural fence
scotty pulls his arms away from his face
throw the ball back
yeah yeah hurry up
we gotta a game here man
moves for the ball
as he goes he sweats kay ill get it
dont be a goofus dont be a goofus dont be a goofus
he reaches the fence and the ball and stops
its hard to move
the force emanating from the backyard has got him keeps perfect time with the monster breathing
it scares the living kapok out of who snatches up the ball and back pedals feet
he throws back the ball
and his chances of getting in with these guys are over
throws like a girl
droops forward in the air
lands feet from him
rolls slowly up to the gang finally coming to a dainty stop at denunez feet
looks from the ball to scotty
they crack up
my life is over
is the only one that isnt laughing
he stares the others down
come on benny man didnt you see that throw
he imitates it flipping his glove to ham
the gang busts up again
that kids got the gawdamn panty waistiest arm i ever saw in my whole life
i seen a guy once that threw like that
i mean not that bad but at least so bad that he hadda move in the fourth grade cause they nicknamed him bloomers
bennys look stifles the bunch
i bet not one of you knows how the babe got his nickname
easy cause of the way he looked like a little kid face
bull its just cause he liked kids and stuff
the babe was called the babe because he was like the child of yankee stadium
i knew it
youre all full of crap
george herman ruth got his nickname because his mom died when he was just a little kid and he hadda go live in an orphanage
none of the other guys has heard this before
nobody liked him there
the bigger guys picked on him all the time
and when they messed with him he couldnt fight back cause he was just
so when they messed with him he cried about it
so they called him the babe
this hits home real good
how ya think that kid just felt
benny exits the sandlot leaving the others with a lesson learned
everyone knew benny was different
nobody ever voted or anything but he was the leader
as benny goes into his house the others round the corner far behind him
like a big baseball
even though he seemed like a regular guy he wasnt
benny was special and he was loyal
when theyd all tried out for youth league theyd all made it
but when they found out theyd have to play on different teams benny told em that if they couldnt play together they shouldnt play at all
so they stayed together
bennys at the window clutching a baseball staring over at scottys house
so the only person that ever felt sorry for me cause i was such a weenie was benjamin franklin rodriguez
even though neither of us knew it at the time we were connected
like i had been born for just that one moment when i would perform the worlds all time boner and benny would bail me out
connected as friends
born to meet for just that one moment
we drift off benny to his picture of maury wills in a pickle
a picture of maury wills on a post super sugar crisp box
at the table
bill sifting through mounds of paperwork
scotty eating breakfast
scottys spoon clangs one too many times
bill looks up at him
scotty picks up his bowl and cereal goes into where his mom is making coffee
hes too busy mom
go back in there and ask
hell take the time
scotty comes back in
stops mutely near bill
long agonizing seconds pass
finally um da quick look toward the kitchen then so mom wont hear i mean bill
i mean could you like you said teach me to catch today
um yeah but later okay
i gotta get this done
it aint much but its something
mom comes in behind scotty
bill cant you take a break and teach him now
mom its okay honey i said i would and i will
im just under the gun here ya know
mom really how long could it take
you cant spare a half hour to show him
bill drops his pen
checks his watch
a lost battle here
ill get my glove
bill exits past them
scottys been mom embarrassed
she looks at him there
told you so
scotty shuffles out back shaking his head
bill slides his hand into his glove
he warms up the cradle popping the hardball into the palm
stands ready to learn on the other side of the yard
appropriately pitiful in trout cap and toy glove
keep your eye on the ball
put the glove up where it goes
yeah okay i think so
bill throws one to scotty
the toy glove goes up to the right
the ball sails by to the left
bills a little amazed at that one
he checks his watch
thats alright just throw it back
scotty eagerly retrieves it
turns to throw deja vu he runs over hands bill the ball
he runs back across the yard
turns round again
holds his glove up stiffly
bill cannot believe this
checks his watch again
keep your eye on the ball
put the glove up where the ball goes
he throws again
the ball bounces off the toy glove breaks the webbing
my glove got not bad
right side at least
now just throw it back this time
but my glove bills looking at his watch again
scotty fetches the ball gulps flips it back
oh my god
benny comes out of his house
from the sidewalk up the side of scottys house into the backyard
he can see scotty
standing there game as hell trying to catch balls that seem to be coming too fast
the ball comes
the ball hits the block wall behind him caroming back toward where we assume bill is throwing from
drawing the wrong conclusion
scottys still game
bills at ropes end
check his watch again
alright scott listen this ones gonna come right at you easy okay
just keep your eye on the ball and put your glove up
youll catch it
comes slowly forward
sticks his glove up
hits dead center glove
rips the toy webbing
flies through right in the eye
oh my god whadda jerk
scottys mom comes unglued
well he just took my eye off the ball mom
scottys mom pulls his hand away from his eye
bill grabs a steak from the fridge flops it over scottys eye
keep that on for an hour
itll still be black but it wont swell
well try again soon
sits on the porch
pitiful and forlorn
chin in his hands he looks across the street
his hand moves to cover his black eye
but he thinks the better of it
on the curb across the street
a moment goes by
benny raises a hand
slowly waves back
benny comes over to scottys sidewalk
gonna go play some ball
need a extra guy
doncha like baseball
scotty searches for a quick way out of this
gets it but my gloves busted
so ya know i cant go
benny reaches behind his back
takes something out of his jeans like hes going for a gun
smiles a little
he offers it to scotty
a real glove
i got a extra one
scotty shouts over his shoulder mom
im gonna go play some ball
as they move away down the block
we gotta stop by the first
need a new ball
and chaw and stuff ya know
you dip chaw
benny scotty go inside
benny grabs a new baseball on the stride and handful of bazooka from a jar on the soda fountain counter
he leaves the money and exits
benny and scotty come upon the gang all their mouths are full a bazooka as hams chompin on a candy cigar doing a hey
check me out
im the great bambino
the gang laughs
the gang stifles
theyre none to pleased
ham sees why
the new kid
eight pairs of eyes burn holes in his little soul
what did he say

you never heard of the sultan of swat
the titan of terror
the colossus of clout
the colossus of clout
even hes amazed the king of krash

but there was no way i could let them know that
so i lied

scotty runs over there anxiously
takes home plate worried maybe the kid is a weenie
denunez at the mound
repeat at rd stabs it effortlessly and fires to nd
timmy snatches it down and drag tags the invisible base runner then fires to bertram at st
bertram throws back to denunez
bennys ready smalls
comes down right at who raises the glove and skippers around as if he were tracking a falling leaf
the ball lands feet behind him
shakes its collective head exasperated
runs to the ball is about to throw
runs it in to denunez instead
runs back to right field
ready again a game kid
trots out after him
hey you can throw it ya know

scotty turns to leave
benny grabs his arm
you think too much
i bet you get straight as and shit huh

but it shoulda been a b
this is baseball youre not supposed to think youre just supposed to play

when your arm gets here
just let go of it
just let go
benny starts back
wait how do i catch it
just stand there and stick your glove in the air
ill take care of it
benny mentally calculates the distance
puts a little rub on the ball
flips it into the air
smalls get one
and swings through deliberately
sees it coming
stands there stiffly
sticks his glove up closes his eyes
please catch it
please catch it
please ca snap
his glove swings down
he opens his eyes
looks into his glove
the ball is there
he takes it out and chucks the ball like a folded paper
catches it good and solid at st
hey lets play ball
from home plate gives him a thumbs up
the significance of this is only outweighed by his sudden fear when
of some great lumbering thing moving past a crack in those green fiberglass panels
in good spirits the guys break off to their houses
split up in the middle of the street between their homes
already at his door benny just raises his glove in answer
wait here your glove
scotty opens a new writing tablet and titles the page baseball stuff to remember
the great bambino
he hasnt got a clue
benny coaches scotty
correct batting stance and swing
benny thumb flicks bottle caps at scotty from a coffee can full
theyre tough to hit
but soon scottys tagging every one of them
denunez fires fastball
the ball sails over head in center
from left field gives scotty another thumbs up
the kids in
squints arrives with a box of baseball cards
everyday first thing wed all pick a card from what we called the dugout
squints shakes it up
everybody picks one
it was just a shoe box but whoever we picked we got to be when it was our ups
one day when ham took his pick a little too seriously the guys let me in on the worlds most terrifying secret
mickey mou ah mantle
say hey willie mays
lou brock i mean luis aparicio
the gang peppers at home plate mercilessly
pitches again strike
delivers and takes a ruthian cut at it
connects to deep right
runs beneath it glove up
drops into a backyard
the one with the green fiberglass panels
looks back to whore already packing up in slumped dejection
makes a decision
swallows against fear of the fence
he takes one step toward that fence
wait a sec ill get it
they rush over grab scotty pull him back feet into the fear free zone
holy crap you coulda been killed
yeah yeah truly
whadda you doin
well you were all leavin so i thought id just if you were thinkin you wouldnt a thought that
you cant go back there smalls
then how do we get the ball
forget it its a memory
well get a new one tomorrow
just forget it
well never see it again
scotty stares at them all heads hung
go over there real slow and be quiet
dont touch the fence just peek through that hole in the green stuff
as scotty goes forward the gang steps back
draws his eye close to the hole in the fence
we see a limited view of feet square
we see nothing but the ball
in the small crater its made in the dirt
there are oddly similar craters in the immediate vicinity
those craters are empty
comes down from out of nowhere
as it clears frame the baseball is gone
only the crater remains
scotty snaps his head away from the hole runs over to something got the ball
what was that thing
considered looks are exchanged then in unison campout
note same as sc
a boy scout lantern
professionally built structure
the gangs got sleeping bags
theyre roasting marshmallows over a cub scout camping stove
hams brought personal smores supplies
some more of what
you wanna smore
i havent had anything yet so how can i have any more of nothing
you kill me smalls
look these are smores stuff
pay attention first you take the graham you put the chocolate on the graham hersheys of course you hold the chocolate on the graham while you roast the mallow he
the mallow flames to life
then when the mallows flamin ya stuff it on the chocolate and cover it with the other end
then you scarf
the junk squirts half way down his shirt
squints turns the lantern down low
alright listen up
first time denunez heard this story he bull squints
you did man
denunez shuts up
when yeah yeah heard it he peed his pants
shut up squints did not
you did man
and when the ham heard it he barfed up two bags of marshmallows
it was only one
so stay away from the door
you might fall out
and dont sit on your sleeping bag
you could shit your pants
kid reverence equals fright
the legend of the beast goes back a long time
before any of us could pick up a baseball
back to a place called mertles acres
a legendary place
benefitting from years of kid embellishment a gothic scrapyard fortress oddly designed to keep something in not out
the beast belongs to mr
mertle the guy that used to own mertles acres junkyard
and nobodys ever seen him since the day it happened
blurbling pockets of super heated muck
of twisted vehicles strewn carcasses
that form tortured faces in the shadowy recesses
mertles acres was a bitchin place that had everything you could ever imagine
like savaged shopping carts
a school bus graveyard
cargo ship buoy balls
the gutted shell of a fighter plane
and the stuff was worth a fortune
so one day mr
mertle got him this new pup from the pound
they were glad to get rid of him on account of while hed been there hed killed three dogs bigger than he was
that was exactly what mr
mertle figured he needed to protect his junkyard cause people kept stealing stuff at night when he wasnt around
a maze of dark grimy junk passageways
so he bought the beast and set him loose in mertles acres
at the end of a passage
note we never fully see the beast
the beast was still just a pup of six months but he already weighed a pounds
and he kept gettin bigger
full of meat hits the ground disappears
it spits back into frame
empty and tattered
he threw the beast a trash bag full of meat every night and just left him alone
all alone in the whole place by himself
among a pile of broken headlights
as big as the headlights
like mannequins with bite chunks missing
plastic flamingoes brutally mangled
a decapitated lawn jockey
a plastic cow legs gnawed off
amongst the artificial life forms
in the center of an old truck tire
moving powerfully as tall as a burned out vw
and so in a few months the pup grew into the beast
and he grew big as a car
and he grew mean cause nobody liked him and he didnt like nobody either
and so he only had one thing on his mind
two thieves in ski masks
suddenly a heated wind strips their masks
two elephantine feet come down on their faces
and he did
and he liked it
suddenly enveloped by a shadow
hes dragged into darkness
load their van and take off
the van caves in
the thieves are dragged out blathering in horror
the beast moves like a murderous phantom
we hear roaring and primordial bloodlust
are tossed hither and yon
mixed in with fake flamingoes and a flying plastic cow
detectives speak with mr
mertle his shoulders slumped his eyes moist
they show him file photos of theives in ski masks
the beast was the most perfect junkyard dog that ever lived
a true killing machine
after awhile the police started getting phone calls from people reporting all the missing thieves
the ones the beast had killed
it added up to about guys
mertle solemnly heads inside the junkyard
but they never found a single body
some people say they all got away and were just so scared that they ended up in insane asylums and stuff
but we know what really happened
mertle emerges from the junkyard
cops take cover behind their cars
guns are leveled toward mr
mertle and what follows him at the end of a rusty tow chain
he ate them bones and all
people slam their windows draw their curtains
little kids are snatched up by parents who run inside and lock their doors
leads the the beast on a huge chain
note we only see bits of the beast
the beast was good at his guarddog job
so the cops said he had to be retired
but he didnt have to be killed or nothin on account of there was no evidence
no teeth for dental records
the green fiberglass panels are brand new here in the past
the police told mr
mertle that if wanted to keep the beast he hadda lock him in his backyard so he could never get out
lowers a giant bathtub into the backyard
firemen fill it with water
and that he hadda chain him up sos in case he tried to get out to eat children and stuff he couldnt
sink an i beam girder
cement fills the chasm
contructs a huge lean to from old bullet holed tin ad signs
braises chain to the girder
collars the beast with the other end
disappears beneath the lean to
dust explodes from underneath as he lies down
mertle asked the cops how long he had to keep his pup chained up like a slave
a policeman mouths the word f o r e v e r
ham drools mallow goop
his hands are fisted tight
mallows squirt out twixt his clenched fingers
have their pillows round their heads like bonnets
stare and shake
eyes are shut tight his bottom lip shudders
he checks his pants to see if hes peed them
his mallows a briquette
it sputters and flames out
is proud of his story prowess
the beast sits there under that lean to dreaming about the time when he can break the chain and get out
dreaming of the time when he can chase and kill again
thats why you cant go over there
nobody ever has
nobody ever will
one kid did but nobody ever seen him again
that aint true yeah it is
he got eaten
yeah yeah that kid who went to get his kite
what was his name
it was that guy with the warts on his face
davy the toad
thats what i said
solemnity spreads among them
davy the toad stodenrous
yeah the toad
yeah yeah poor toad
none of thats true
you guys are just oh yeah
stick your head out the window and look down
scotty goes slowly
he sticks his head out guillotinely through the small square opening
scottys head comes out turtle like
the tree house overhangs the common wall
mertles backyard and sees an old footed bathtub filled with murky water
a steel pole cemented into the center of the yard
a tow chain snaking away from the pole and vanishing under the lean to
dust rises and falls from neath the lean to
hears the organic exhaust that accompanies the dust
rising and falling
in powerful exhalations
scotty pulls his head back scared shitless
hes down there
you bet he is
whatever goes over that fence
it becomes the property of the beast
note same as sc
from the sandlot
a full moon hangs ominously over the tree house a glowing little box of debate in the scary night
i learned that more than a baseballs had gone over that fence
and not one of them was ever seen again
even when some brave kid worked up enough courage to peek over the fence
because when they went over they vanished
i knew it was true because when i looked down in there i didnt see a single
squints and yeah yeah come out of the store in a big hurry with a new baseball in a box
they stop momentarily open it and chuck the box
yeah yeah rams his mouth full of zooka spits into his palm and rubs the ball to get the shine off
his eyes go suddenly wide and he stares and oggles and gawks about years old walks by into the store
she smiles at squints
can only manage a totally embarrassing goofy grin
the guys are waiting anxiously as yeah yeah and squints run over
yeah yeah tosses benny the ball
he rubs it up
passes it along
they all take a turn
what took you so long
we been here forever already
squints was pervin a dish
shut up i wasnt
yeah yeah you were
yer tongue was hangin outta yer head and you was swoonin
oh oh wendy peffercorn my darling lover girl

ham holds him back
hold me back
hold me back
i am holdin you back squints
well lemme go then
so whered you get the money this time yeah yeah
oh yeah yeah

so i went around pretended like i was selling perscriptions to magazines
and the people asked if they should pay me now
so i said yeah yeah pay me now
and they did
the guys are astonished
ill take it back
i know it was crappy but i didnt have no money i naw dont man
hes just mad he didnt think of it
yeah you know how many lawns i hadda mow when it was my turn
crests the sandlot
its gonna be a hot one
a real hot one
ham sweats uncontrollably
his lunch bag drips pb j
spits a zooka sploink that sizzles when it hits
simultaneously heads for the bleachers
everybody but benny
i cant take it no more benny
im bakin like a toasted cheeser
its hotter than the fires of hell
its hotter than a fish in a fryin pan
the brothers look at each other on the miscue
come on dont be wimpy
face it benny
its not a fit day out for man nor beast
we gotta call it for the day
everyone that wants to be a cant hack it panty waist and wear their mommas bra raise your hand
they all raise their hands
be like that
so whatre we gonna do then
they look at each other as if bennys gone quite mad
its scam pool honeys
teenage pool honeys arranged particularly on their beach towels along the deck soak up the rays in their polka dot bikinis
rushes out in cut off shorts and banzais the shallow end
ham leaps over the water like a graceful manatee
a ham tsunami sloshes the coppertoned bods of theyre up and screaming at him
benny wouldve played ball all day and all night
rain shine tidal wave whatever it didnt matter
baseball was the only thing he cared about and everything else was just a waste of time
but of all the things we ever did besides baseball goin to the pool was what he tolerated best
even though none of us had ever seen a playboy magazine which we constantly lied about we figured the pool was the next best thing to being there
dunks each other play attack sub etc
it wasnt the pool honeys like we said cause if any one of them had come up to any one of us wed of peed our pants
we went for
in fact its wendy peffercorn
she slides coppertone up and down her legs
one by one stop foolin around
chest deep in the shallow end theyre a detached and frozen pocket of leering dopes
the other kids in the pool play on around them
is suddenly afflicted
and one day it became too much for michael squints palledorous
and he did the most desperate thing any of us had ever seen
oils up and down
cool hand luke scene oh man
yeah yeah too cruel
she dont know what shes doing
she dont know what shes doing
yeah she does
she knows exactly what shes doing
ive swum here every summer of my adult life
and every summer there she is
i cant take this no more
pushes through the water pulls himself out and walks really fast to the diving board taking off his glasses to impress her as he passes
whats wrong with him
dont know but thats the deep end and squints cant swim
walks the plank to the end
looks wantingly toward who smiles back at him
holds his nose
takes the deep leap
hits the water and
sinks like a stone
squints grins as he founders
lines the edge of the deep section
oh my god
to the rescue
she surfaces and lays a limp everybody at the pool gathers round
the lifeguard lays squints flat
she administers mouth to mouth
the gang watches on tense as hell
squints peeks at them through a secretly opened eye
as the lifeguard is saving his sneaky life squints can no longer restrain himself he grabs her gives her a sloppy smooch
she tears away
stands up over his wimpy little form you little pervert
she grabs squints by the scruff of the neck
run walks him toward the exit and
chucks his boney butt into the hedges
the guys scramble out dragging their clothes after them
they help squints up
did you plan that
acourse i did
been plannin it for years
they let squints walk out front michael squints palledorous walked a little taller that day
and we had to tip our hats to him
he was lucky she hadnt beat the crap out of him
we wouldnt have blamed her
what hed done was sneaky rotten and low
not another one among us wouldve ever even for a million dollars had the guts to put the move on the lifeguard
he had kissed a woman
and he kissed her long and good
we got banned from the pool forever that day
but every time we walked by after that the lifeguard looked down from her watchtower right over at squints
scotty pours over his baseball stuff to remember list
right field is near the green fence
left field is in the left
double play gets two outs
triple play is impossible
single is good
double is better
home run is best
and ominously dont get in a pickle or youre dead
and one entry thats double question marked
the great bambino
the guys play in magic hour
jolts a high fly to in right field
no problem now
he backpedals judging
scotty makes a clean catch
gives scotty thumbs up
just as gonna throw the ball back he shivers noticing that the sun has fallen to a precise declination its rays focused behind the glowing green fiberglass of against which
a hulking black form rises in the backyard
blocking out the sun against the panels
a gargantuan shadow
the shadow vanishes
tribal drums sound far in the distance
the oleander bushes rustle menacingly like
a wall of tropical foliage
note the scene with natives atop the wall when kong grabs fay wray
on the projector screen king kong rips through the jungle
here with other boys at the afternoon show
the gang gathers
ham bursts out behind the gang as kong
the guys scream spin to face the ham
he busts up
hey check me out
im the mighty king kong
it was a joke ya dopes
do i look like a monkey
of other kids comes out behind them
matching caps and shirts
the gang straightens up
ya smell like one too
hey guys its the sandlot babies
skin yer knees lately sliding on rocks
shut up blockhead
whatre you gonna do porter sit on me
rodriquez why do hang around with these rejects man
you could be playin with us on a official american youth league certified big time diamond
youd make the allstar team easy
play us and youll find out why phillips
forget it we play real ball not with toy bats and sneakers
the punks head off laughing as they go
benny glares at them
benny man are we gonna let em get away with that
the guys round a corner and continue on
they fall serious
you think he really died in the end
hes so big that fallin off the empire states just like us fallin off a roof
so whadda you think happened to him
heads are scratched
chins are rubbed
thoughts are thunk
has anyone ever really seen the beast
except scotty he goes forward turns back
you ever seen king kong for real
in person i mean
but well hes real right
and hes still out there somewhere right
see theres just somethings that are
ya know stuff that its better not to talk about
cause thinkin about it just makes it worse
nobody has to see the beast to know hes there
you dont think that the beast is really
no ones ever considered this
they suddenly realize where they are denial kicks in as they carry on king kong
god is that stupid
no stinkin way
oh boy had me feelin like a douf there for a minute
whew what a relief
from this height we see them round the corner and carry on past the sandlot
little debating specks far away from us and the cares of the world
hey who dya thinkd win in a fight king kong or godzilla
yeah yeah wait a sec maybe theyll do a movie someday and well find out
that would be cool
id see that
kong would kick his ass
no way zillas got that fire breath stuff hed fry the monkey
the gang heads toward hallowed halls
footsteps echo as the gang walks along alone in awe
the dodgers and our gangs home team are taking batting practice
and a bunch of kids at the infield railing
benny sticks his glove through the crowd up to a certain player
besides the great bambino who i still had no clue about benny had one living hero
autographs bennys glove
hands it back to
benny whos suddenly here watching a baseball game
the gangs with him
yeah yeah here he comes
hes gonna steal second
naw he aint not yet
maury wills on st
taunting the pitcher
big lead off
a guy that would break the stolen bases record that year that had stood for as many years as there were baseballs lost to the beast
cant wait for wills to go
hes gonna go benny
here he goes man
right now watch watch
leans forward seriously
maury wills gets ready to steal
maury wills became a hero for what he did
maury wills steals second
smiles to himself
howd you know that
howd you guess
howd ya know
would become a legend
scotty opens the front door bennys there
th of july party inside
get your glove cmon
whats the big deal
the sun is setting
hurries along with their ball gear through a block party of bubble topped bbqs attended by aproned dads grillin dogs n burgers
clutching red devil fireworks timing the sinking sun
pouring iced tea
pilfers dog makins from various qs
concocts a two fisted doglog
he catches up to marching away into the setting sun
in the street
the same size in frame as our guys at the end of the block are set to fuses
rush for the curbs
and in kaleidoscopic columns of star hot colors
bursting fireworks in the sky down from which we tilt to playing hard beneath them
there was only one nightgame a year
on the fourth of july the whole sky would brighten up with fireworks giving us just enough light for a game
we played better then too
because i guess we all felt like big leaguers under the lights at some great stadium
benny felt like that all the time
knocks dirt from his p
twirls the bat
cocks it back
coils up round his back leg
ash meets cowhide
high above them
stops play and marvels up at the colors
a little kid with a too big mitt and floppy cap goggling up at the fireworks
the ball lands by him
he retrieves it
is about to throw stops
staring at benny up at bat slung second naturedly over his shoulder
a real ball player
we all knew benny was different
we knew that he was gonna go on to bigger and better games
because everytime we stopped to watch the sky that night like regular kids benny was there to call us back
cranks one to kingdom come
for him baseball wasnt just a game
for benjamin franklin rodriguez
in a beautiful burst above them
baseball was life
the gang is still in the same positions
as if having never left
fires to rd from home
ham and repeat catch benny in a pickle
benny feints dodges and rubba legs them
he crosses home easily
truly rubba legs
truly rubba legs
show up on their bikes
its easy when you play with rejects and fat kids rodriquez
the gang follows
whatid you say crapface
he said they shouldnt be allowed to even touch a baseball
theyre an insult to the game
that did it
ham rushes the punk
the gang holds him back
well take you on right here right now
we play on a real diamond porter
and you aint good enough to lick the dirt off our cleats
watch yer mouth jerk
shut up dipshit
dog crap for breakfast eatin geek
you mix yer wheaties with your mommas toe jam
you bob for apples in your toilet and you like it
the teams gasp
then thundering silence
the ultimate baseball insult
what did you say
you heard me
at our field
be there buffalo butt breath
count on it pee drinkin craphead
ham raises his catchers mask whif
he stabs it
fires to outta there
hits a lazy fly ball to where scotty and bertram run for it watching the ball not i got it
i got it
they stop the ball drops between them
i thought you had it
rounds nd base
somebody get it
picks it up and fires for home for all hes worth
rockets toward home
slides in a cloud of dust
and ham drags the baseline
hams got him tagged
ham goes jackie gleasonaic you are out of here
to the moon
roger wilco over and out
ham abruptly stops cramdoning because at him
ah youre out
bennys at bat
single to left
throw to st too late
throw to nd too late
throw to rd hes on his way home
throw to home safe
gawk an inside the park home run
get used to it
the gang belting shot after shot
rounding base after base
soxx the blue jeans zip a dee do dah scene
the guys strut along air batting mime catching
benny rips a momentous victory slide
the gang comes down the midway and stops at a ticket booth for a ride we dont yet see
as they buy their tickets crack
you see the looks on their faces
it was like duh
so thats how you play baseball
i almost forgot
he holds up a pounch of chewin baccy
i was savin it for a good time
what is it
i spose you dont who the babe is either
bertram passes it around
whadda you do with it
youre killin me smalls
you chew it of course
all the pros do
yeah yeah gives ya tons of energy
bertram pinches a too huge wad
stuffs it in his mouth
the bag goes around
all cud up
kinda tastes like an ashtray smells
the gang gets on the ride the anti grav
as they ride and spin round and round and round
the brown glop falls from their mouths
they all watch who turns salmon
then presumably yawns breakfast lunch and dinner like a firehose
at least thats what we hear as the ride spins vertical that and a host of blood curddling screams from vom victims
as the ensues
they all running screaming from the ride and lose it
the gang wobbles moaning as they go
ham is strangely unaffected he unpockets a fistful of some digusting glorp the guys lose it
we drift off them and their predicament to in the green fiberglass fence
an eyeball big bloodshot and amused
the beast is laughing at them
scottys cod belly white and jelly fish limp from a long bout of the chuckies
bill tosses his luggage in the car trunk
scottys mom leans out the drivers window
ill be back in an hour scotty im taking dad to the airport
where you goin
chicago on business for a week
listen scott while im gone youre the man of the house
yeah i guess so
well take another stab at catch when i get back okay
so take care of things while im gone
im counting on you
he offers his hand to scotty
the gang comes out with a new boxed baseball
each has a pack of topps
a bag of bazooka
once we got over trying to be big shots we just stuck to what we could handle and swore off the hard stuff forever
when we finally got back together for some baseball something amazing happened
it was an omen
one that was meant just for benjamin franklin rodriguez
they tear open their packs of baseball cards
first things first they eat the gum sticks
then shuffle through the cards looking for gold
whadya get ham
a mickey mantle and guys i never heard of
how bout you
a brooks robinson and a koufax
i got junk
one drysdale a bunch a duds
yeah yeah me too
four bombs but one whitey ford
benny whad the guys notice staring down at the cards in his hands
he slowly shuffles them top to bottom
top to bottom
moves over concerned
hey benny whatsa matter
you okay man
benny slowly raises his eyes
slowly holds the cards out to squints who takes them cautiously
squints shuffles them forwards and backwards
he passes the eight cards amongst them all
oh my god
alternate line same unstinkinbelievable
dont tell mom i said that tim
this cant happen
it just did
yeah yeah its an omen
squints hands the cards back to the benny who takes home plate alone
can only stare at him
suddenly squints clutches his ear oh geez
i i dont believe it
maury wills just stole bases
the guys are boggled
picks up a bat
we gotta play
i gotta play right now guys
they hurry into the field
as they go whats it mean
its a miracle smalls
a damn miracle
we all expected something to happen right then
during that game
what we had just witnessed was bordering on the supernatural
we knew that greater hands than ours were at work
and it happened alright
it happened right in front of our noses
and we didnt even know it
magic dust explodes from bennys bat
the red lacing bursts
the string wound innards fly into in left field
the cowhide figure s lay there in like huge swatted moths
the guys gather round
naw it aint
cmon benny maybe two three guys in history have ever busted the guts out of a ball
thats what the omen was
yeah yeah benny
it must be so
alls it means is that we cant play no more
its only noon and i just blew the whole day for us
no you didnt
its the most amazing thing i ever seen
anybody got any money
then it aint okay cause now we cant play no more
yeah we can
what you got extra cents just layin around at home smalls
no but i got a ball
a baseball on a silver pedestal bills baseball
scottys hand enters frame
his indecisive fingers almost touch the ball
scotty dashes across the schoolyard
out of breath i got it
he tosses the ball to who catches it
your ball your ups
benny hands scotty the bat heads to right field leaving alone at home plate with ham the catcher
tosses denunez the ball on his way by
almost misses it
he rounds up throws to at st
bertram throws to at nd
timmy almost drops it
theres a smudge on the ball
timmy tosses to at rd
repeat fires to in left
the ball caroms off yeah yeahs glove comes down fast
yeah yeah barehands it
he launches to in center
its gonna be short
squints sprints willy mays basket catch
he throws to denunez
scotty swings whiff
scotty drops the bat
trots for first base in home run fashion
watches him slowing worrying
drops over the green fiberglass fence
stops dead in the base path
nice crank smalls
its outta here
whos got the big bat now boys
is drawn to the fence with mounting terror
what the hells he doing
maybe the shock of his first homer was just too much for him
scotty runs right up to it clutches desperately
the guys arrive
scotty turns back to them
he has aged years
we gotta get that ball back
good one smalls
well just hop over and say excuse me mr
beast sir could we have our ball back oh and please dont kill us while were here
it was a great shot but forget about it
well get another ball
you dont understand
sure we do
you feel bad cause you belted a homer and now we cant play no more
you dont understand
that wasnt of something moving in the backyard
just a rippling shadow and trailing dust accompanying it over the fence top
eyes go to scotty
whadda you mean it wasnt your ball
its my stepdads
i stole it from his trophy room
it was a present or soemthing somebody gave it to him
we have to get it back
hes gonna kill me
listen to me
this is a matter of life and death
where did your old man get that ball
i think some lady gave it to him
yeah she even signed her name on it
some lady named ruth
pop from their sockets
sprints for the fence
scramble up it
just their eyes peer over the top
a baseball in a little impact crater
a ball that has most clearly been autographed by
a long hideous forelimb thrusts from neath the lean to
a massive paw thing comes down on the ball
drags it slowly away
leaving a baseball deep furrow in the dirt
the canine laughter comes again
drops from the fence turn to face scotty
the beast got it
youre dead as a doornail smalls
youre dead as a doornail smalls
nice knowing you
nice knowing shut up tommy
smalls you mean to tell me you went home and swiped a ball that was signed by babe ruth and brought it out here and actually played with it
and actually played with it
yeah but i was gonna put it back
but it was signed by babe ruth
well who is she
what did he say
the sultan of swat
the king of krash
the colossus of clout
for good measure the great bambino
that did it yeah
smalls babe ruth is the greatest baseball player that ever lived
people say he was less than a god but more than a man
like hercules or somethin
the ball that you just aced to the beast is worth
well more than your whole life
scotty falls to his knees
grabs his stomach
i dont feel so good
they all step back expecting the worst
then they fan him with their baseball caps
we gotta get that ball back
when does your old man get home from work
hes gone on business for a week
okay we need cents
so everybody spread out and find some soda bottles and cash em in
we need a new baseball
bennys hand signs b a b e r u t h across the leather in ridiculous chicken scrawl
forgery in progress
benny does the honors
i dunno benny man
yeah yeah its pretty crappy
he aint gonna buy that benny
it doesnt look anything like the babes signature
it doesnt matter what it looks like
his moms never gonna know the difference
thisll just buy us some time ya dorks
scottys hand enters frame
little anxious fingers wrapped around the phony babe ruth baseball
the second the ball is back on its pedestal scotty
scotty whips round like hes been slapped by a wet mackerel moms in the doorway
honey what are you doing in here
just looking at bills i mean dads baseball
scotty hurries away from the autographed ball
you know he doesnt like you touching his things
yeah i know
has he ever told you about that ball
uh no not really i dont think so no he hasnt at all i dont know anything about it
its signed by babe ruth
sweet mother of mom knows
scotty may collapse
the greatest baseball player that ever lived
it sure is
dads father gave it to him
maybe someday hell give it to you
it was salt in an open wound
even my own mom who was only a grown up girl knew who babe ruth was
the gangs all here
so how do we get it back
i have no idea
i was dead meat
i knew it
they knew it
we had thought that those cards benny had gotten meant that something great was going to happen
now i figured that theyd just meant my life was over
cant we just hop the fence and get it
remember davy stodenrous
why dont we just go over there and knock on the door and ask mr
mertle to get it for us
everyone looks at scotty the kid just sprouted a dunce cap
are you outta your mind
mertle is the meanest old man that ever lived
hes the one that sicked the beast on the toad
thats not an option smalls
forget about it
not a single blinking idea between them
then suddenly we need to assess the situation
better than nothing of course
good one squints
access sic the situation
how do we do that
first we survey the enemys environment then we make note of the surrounding terrain
i heard that on combat
lets just look out the window
the gang pokes their heads only through the window
they look down into the house is a godforsaken stuccod corpse
is the final resting place for melted frisbees withered kickballs skeletons of heat crumbled paper kites an airforce of exposure splintered balsa wood gliders and a fleet of model rockets
their drag chutes turning to dust
and hundreds of little empty craters that used to cradle baseballs
snakes through the dirt buried then exposed
it terminates from under which rises hazy twirls of dust
the dust is kept from ever settling by some enormous organic exhaust
emerges from under the lean to pushing the babe ruth autographed cowhide into full view i dare you
the guys jerk their heads back inside
hes darin us
hes darin us
hes waitin for us man
just like he did with the toad
were on his territory now
think hes pissed
is doby gillis a dork
anybody got any bright ideas
a tree house debate
many hands miming mechanical contraptions
we had absolutely no idea what the hell we were gonna do
so things started primitively
the gang hurries out from the timmons yard carrying a broom stick
they wriggle it under the fiberglass fence
squints peers through the peep hole motioning directions to ham
ham pulls the stick back
the guys fell the clothes line pole with a hack saw
feet of inch thick pipe
they heft it up go out to and shove the pipe under the green fiberglass
horrible sounds erupt from the badlands
dust mushrooms over the fence
the pipe draws under in ferocious jerks
the pole sails back over the fence bounces on the asphalt with angry clangs
hands it over
how embarrassing it aint mine
i told you its my little sisters
a cootie toy
they putting a hunk of chewed zooka on each cootie foot
attach it to a plastic parachute ah ha
an airborne assault
squints indicates go
out the tree house window
it floats silently toward the baseball
the cootie lands right on the babe ruth
the gum sticks
hauls it in
suddenly erupt from neath the lean to and chomp the cootie whole
the string snaps
pulls up the frayed end
now a war room
map of the badlands crazed trajectories distances to the beast etc
coffee can pbx system
xs on a calendar counting down bills return
the new retreival system all connected
hams catchers mask bolted to the end pipe for ball securing
toy flashlights and bsoa lanterns hang from the structure semi illuminating the badlands
goes the vacuumtraption feet of wobbly pipe
squints directs the operation looking we see the vacupipe mask
inches from the baseball
coffee can muffled a okay
initiate retreival suction
they throw eureka switch one
the baseball moves itty bittily
they throw eureka switch two
the baseball moves a lot
they throw eureka switch three
the baseball leaps from the ground sticks in the catchers mask collection basket
we have suction
pull it up
pull it the gang reels it in
suddenly the whole apparatus jolts
a great beef paw yanks the end pipe under the tree
pinch the metal tube shut
the vacuums build pressure fast
leaps from tree house
lingers in the trap doorway a second too long the gang minus squints is face down in the dirt arms over heads
the vacuums explode
foggy clouds of dust pour out of the treehouse
hes battleship grey
takes his glasses off
only his eyes show white
weve been going about this all wrong
i blame myself
we need total surprise
therefore we tunnel
the beast will never expect it
the guys all wield a shovel and have flashlights taped to their baseball caps like coal miners
flashlight beam at the fore scotty crawls with a safety rope round his waist
he pokes the cardboard periscope up through the dirt
the badlands from ultra low ground level
we scan degrees
suddenly the scan stops
the name b a b e r u t h fills the periscopes lens
scottys hand feels for the babe ruth
he grabs it
i got it
i got it
the ball squirts out of his fingers
beneath the lean to
it hits in the nose
with a seismic roar the beast leaps out
we dont see much
hes too big
were too close
yeah yeah shouts to ham at the tunnel entrance
its huge oh my god
its huge pull him out
pull him the beasts jaws dive toward scottys hand
they get within an inch of scottys hand and his fingers vanish thwooop
the gang pulls scotty out of the hole
yeah yeah is unconscious on the grass
the guys turn a hose on him
he comes round screaming its huge pull him out
oh god its like a dinosaur
wh wh where am i

the guys sniff

according to the calendar day till bills back
scottys got the conch
i think i know how to get it
theyre all ears anybody got an erector set

never heard of it
i used to have one when i was like i dunno a little kid

the guys re arrive
each holding huge arm loads of erector set stuff
guess i had more than i thought

scottys brought his set
a footlocker full of neatly arranged pieces
nut and bolt compartments
electric motor sections
i really like erector set
i was just thinkin the same thing
couldnt agree more smalls
i play with mine all the time
lets get to work
heres the plans furlsnap
scotty unfolds them amazing crayola blueprints drawn on taped together grocery bags
the guys swarm the tree house
scotty supervises from the backyard wearing a plastic hardhat
scotty hooks up electric motors
throws one toggle and
it comes to life
a foot hollow erector beam and electric catapult car assembly
they tilt n tip it over the fence
scotty pilots the little car from the treehouse deck
bennys got his glove waiting
scotty on controls
squints on periscope with bertram on the yuban comm for him
others at support points
the car drives down
the beast strirs
the car rolls out the end
the catapult bucket scoops the ball
flips the toggle
runs for it
i got it
i got it
blocks out the sun
the beasts front teeth snatch the babe ruth ball delicately out of the air
crash lands beyond the fiberglass paneling right on top of wrenching it viciously
comes tumbling down bending into flimsy knots as it crashes
scotty stands alone on the tree house roof
staring down into the badlands
a little wrecked shell of a kid who is now dead meat
the guys look up at him sorrowfully
my life was over
just as bill had finally warmed up to me and asked me to be the man of the house i had to knock a priceless chunk of history into the
clutches of a monster
the gang minus timmy and repeat shuffle along home without a word exchanged
benny watches a dejected scotty slowly head inside across the street
scotty stares up at the ceiling in oceans of worry
the room is dark
bennys in bed
he clicks on a baseball bat flashlight
shines the beam toward his footboard
illuminating the photo of the babe
we cant get it back babe
suddenly a racket from inside bennys closet
a bright light goes on in there
then smoke comes out
benny jumps up on his bed flattens against the wall
hasnt done this in years m m mom
the closet door creaks open
everything inside is oddly devoid of color
babe ruth steps out of the closet
he exists in the only way any kid from has ever seen him black white
now dont go peeing your pants or nuthin im just here to give ya a hand
the great bambino puffs on a massive stogie
the source of all the smoke
b b but youre
legends never die kid
benny comes off the wall
the enormous ruth towers over him
youre really him
youre the babe
the sultan of swat
the king of krash and a hundred other dopey names

im here cause youre in some kinda pickle right
a baseball with my john hancock on it went over a fence and you cant get it back
clear and simple then just hop over there and get it
there ya go
tips his cap see ya kid
the babe turns to go back to wherever he came from
benny grabs his arm shocked that he actually feels something real
go into that backyard
theres a beast back there
a giant gorilla dog thing that ate one kid already
is that a fact
listen to me kid
everybody gets one chance to do something great
most people either never take the chance cause theyre too scared or they dont recognize it when it spits on their shoes
this is your big chance and ya shouldnt let it go by

the babe disappears back into the closet then remember kid
theres heroes and theres legends
heroes get remembered
but legends never die
follow your heart kid and youll never go wrong
a racket in the closet matching knuckles on glass
scotty hurries sleepy eyed to the window and opens it
benny stands outside holding a shoe box
i had a dream
were goin to the sandlot
the guys march toward the rising sun across the sandlot behind benny
they stop here
benny steps forward
he opens the shoe box
laces on brand new p
moves for the fence
scotty grabs his arm
its okay it was my fault
ill just take whatever i get
you dont have to do this
a look in bennys eyes
yeah i do smalls
i have to
benny turns from him swallows hard
swings himself onto and balances deciding
in bennys head follow your heart kid and youll never go wrong
benny turns back one last time
gives scotty thumbs up
with a pearl divers breath he plunges into
he stands fixed staring hard neath the lean to
the lazy clinks of heavy chain links
the beast is rising to its feet
piece by piece fore feet the size of a catchers mitt bulking head and shoulders hulking flank and haunches
mouth hangs open
hes frozen staring at and its worse than squints recounted
because its real
this is the biggest dog that ever lived
this was a bad idea
the beast lingers feet away with slack in the chain
it spits something out which rolls in the dirt
a goo slobbered ball
dirty beast foam drips off revealing the smeared signature b a b e r u t h
ghead kid i dare you
benny measures the beast
times its ballooning chest
the beasts eyes glue to benny
flopping hot water bottle tongue pants
leatherd nose twitches smelling for movement
of bennys p
flyer digs into the cracked earth
the beast leans forward one chain link lifts from the ground
benny spits blowing his tanks
benny goes for the ball
knotted muscles quaver and uncoil
flyers leave behind tiny dust roosters
claws dig deep furrows
fog banks of dust spread out behind it
forelegs gallop at flared over anxious angles
leaves scrambling footprints
he slides grabs the ball pops up maury wills fashion heads back for the fence
the ball slips from bennys fingers
re grabs it shoves the ball in his teeth freeing his hands for the leap up the fence
jaws shut like a tripped bear trap
springs off the ground
hes on the fence
reaches chains end it goes taught
the two foot length still attached to the beasts neck bullwhips the chain catches benny in the butt
he vaults over the fence
the gang looks up
a great shadow envelopes them
the guys turn to stone
benny takes off
the beast tears by the guys after benny
the two vanish out of the sandlot
whatre we waitin for
lets go after em
the beast is gaining
in its wake dichondra lawns ripped to shreds
scotty and the guys make tracks a block behind
on display pinwheels mailbox propellers and puddle jumpers
benny flies by
the beast follows
as they pass contact the whirly gigs take off
a mother drives
in the passenger seat her toddler fingers a scooter pie in marshmallowy strings
mommy mommy wook
ah ah goggy
the mother looks out the passenger window
benny and the beast run even
then pull ahead
gag per storyboards t
the beast follows trashcans scatter like bowling pins
scotty and the guys follow
all slow to check out the garbage bins
so many crushed beer cans
benny darts in the rear entrance to a random building
the beast tears after him knocking the door off its hinges
on the movie screen kong does battle with t rex
comes sliding at us across the waxed stage floor from under the movie screen
he slides off the stage into midair lands on his feet
splits up the aisle between the rows of folding chairs and blasts out the door
turn to watch him
they look back at where just as kong proclaims himself king over the dead t rex leaps through the center of the silver screen leaves a foot hole lands feet
down the aisle crashes through the doors and disappears
our guys follow
hot rubber squeaks from bennys p
the beasts claws leave jagged scars in the concrete
in terror and faint
pool honeys lounge all bedecked with rock hard annette funicello hairdos
benny blasts out of the pool building tire stepping over the honeys
theyre up and ranting at him
until the beast comes
sliding across the water slippy deck like an out of control anvil
he bowling pins the pool honeys
the honeys hit benny cuts back through the pool building
the beast follows parting our guys and the other kids
game in progress
from outta nowhere benny jams across the diamond
the game stops
everyone gapes at some huge dog beast charging after a kid
big banner founders day
perfectly arranged picnic blankets covered with wonderful spreads of goodies
zips under the banner runs through grabs a coke like a long distance runner
rages after him through of neatly arranged display booths
this is pie n cake booth gag per storyboards allow pages
founders day parade et al
rips into the square
he rubba leg zigzags nimbly avoiding everything and everyone
is a runaway freight train
he plows through clowns
children are snatched from the dogs path by terrified parents
the beast tears through the concession stands explode
the volunteers dash out screaming tar n featherd with baked beans and potato chips
zips through the marching band ducking trombone slides leaping glockenspiels
aint so graceful
he barn doors the band
an instrument tangled heap
pour into the street knocking the mayor from his convertible and the founders day queen from her float
this all looks like the end of a dr
search through the confusion
theyve lost benny
suddenly doubling back on them sandlot
seconds later the beast follows
forges through the disaster
the gangs gasping for breath
and then unbelievably are coming right at them
they race across the sandlot
kill anxious beast drool splashes the seat of bennys pants
he runs as if a big dog was chasing him
he lurches a step rip
a pants pocket flaps from an incisor
he lays down the worlds all time most perfect slide
he careens toward the bottom of hits it and defying gravity runs straight up the green jets upward leaving smashed green fiberglass footsteps standing out from the fence degrees the
donald oconnor singin in the rain trick
sucks air roars explodes from the ground soars gaping maw first right for who pushes off the top of the fence
gnashes up at bennys heels misses by an inch
he plummets toward the badlands
then the unspeakable happens and comes tumbling down after the ball
benny hits the dirt with a gut twisting thud
the gang climbs the fence
they look down into where when the dust clears they see holding the babe ruth autograph up high like a trophy
hops down and races over
suddenly from the his shirt snagged help him
is hanging from the fence
his chain has caught
he struggles choking to death right below scotty
petrifies where they stand
tears his shirt loose
scrambles to where the beast hangs
tries to lift the tow chain free too heavy
hell die in seconds
pick him up
scoot him up so i can let him off
they wanna but they cant
goes for broke
he reaches out and puts his hand on the beasts head
scotty balances atop the fence
grabs the tow chain
lifts with all his might
his fingers bleed
the beast goes limp
that did it
the beast falls
goes with him feet to the dirt
the fence comes down breaking the barrier to the sandlot
he lands on the ground with the beast
leaps to his feet
rises with him
watches in horror
scans them instinctively he might kill them all where they stand
about to load up his fruit o da looms
sticks his mammoth head right in scottys face
the kid is lunch
his jowls part hot beast breath blows scottys hair back
closes his eyes
slap their hands to their eyesockets
cold leather nose presses against scottys forehead
he licks scottys face
wipes away the beast slob
he doesnt even have to kneel down to read the name on the beasts doggy tag
this time scotty gives benny thumbs up
hercules digs then stands away
look into the hole
their faces light up with wonder
in are baseballs
we can play forever now
takes the beast by the collar
he and benny go to scotty knocks
mertle answers the door
an old man with dark glasses
he comes out on the porch
um we brought your dog home
howd he get out
um we kind of well what happened was we hit a baseball into your yard
then we tried to get it and why didnt you just come to the door
id have gotten it for you
squints yeah yeah ham denunez repeat timmy and bertram faint
well thanks for bringin him back
why dont you boys come in
we can talk about baseball
fairly spartan except for one room where it seems that mr
mertle spends most of his time
he leads benny and scotty mr
mertle sits at a table
benny and scotty stare at the tabletop
it holds a scale model baseball diamond green felt field and little bases outfield wall and miniature player figures
a picture on the wall of mr
mertle and babe ruth
you knew babe ruth
and he knew me too
they never let us play together but we were friends
he was almost as great a hitter as i was
but hed of told you he was better
the picture is signed to thelonius johnson mertle the second greatest slugger i ever saw
a baseball game on the radio
as each play is called mr
mertles hands deftly put his tiny players in the correct positions
mertle is blind
this the one that went over my fence
mertle brushes his fingers over the leather
this is an old ball boys
hercules gave it a good chewing didnt he
you sound upset son whats wrong
well you see
that ball belongs to my stepdad
and uh it was signed by babe ruth
mertle shakes his head
hands the ball to scotty
well im sure your dad will understand
i dont think so
on the radio wills steals second
son move maury wills to second base for me will ya
benny moves the little figure to second base
if he steals third thatll be number
helluva pickle youre in boy
mertle retrieves something from a glass case
ill make you a deal
if you boys come over once a week and talk baseball with me ill trade you balls
well thats really nice of you
but this ball really is signed by the babe
this one really is too
and all the rest of the yankees
he hands his baseball to scotty
benny stares at it in disbelief
oh my god murderers row
as they ogle the ball lou gehrig
theyre all there
scotty hands mr
mertle the chewed up babe ruth ball
shakes his hand
on the radio maury wills steals rd for his th stolen base
scotty notices the wall clock moms car is in the driveway
scotty goes up the walkway slowly
benny just behind him
the gang lingers at the sidewalk
scotty sets one foot on the and bill comes out
he looks none too pleased
he towers over scotty
the gang hangs their heads
this better be good
benny unpockets a little felt bag
hands it to scotty
he holds the bag up to a perplexed bill who opens it
he looks from scotty to benny and back again
stares down at the murderers row ball
a baseball sailing through the air
its caught in a brand new glove
scottys new glove
scotty snap throws the ball back to bill
he and scotty are having a great game of catch
it was weird that benny said babe ruth was like the hercules of baseball and then the beasts name turned out to be hercules
it was also strange that mr
mertle had a murderers row ball to replace the one signed by the babe
bill and scotty smile as they fire the cowhide back and forth
some people might say that it was all a coincidence
but looking back at it now it seems like everything was connected just like me and benny
it was like we were a part of the same myth as the babe
the myth of baseball
scottys mom sticks her head out the back door
she smiles watching her two boys toss the ball around
guys suppers ready
give us another ten minutes
im helpin my boy break in his new glove
mertle sits contentedly behind his little diamond
the radio announcer calls maury wills th steal of
his hand moves a wooden figure from st to nd
this tactile playing field becomes
this one where the guys are playing ball
theres a new addition to their team
a big mascot
in a t shirt and cap
all play as if somehow this may be the last time they ever get to be a team
as they play theyre sponged from the picture in this order yeah yeah repeat and timmy ham denunez bertram squints hercules scotty benny
that was the last summer that we all got to play together
but it would stay with us forever
as they all dissolve yeah yeahs parents shipped him off to military school
timmy and tommy grew up to build skyscrapers
ham went to college and became a pediatrician
denunez played triple a ball and never got to the majors
bertram got really into the sixities and no one ever saw him again
squints grew up and married wendy peffercorn they bought the five dime and they still own it to this day
hercules lived to be years old
in human years
everyone but benny has vanished from the sandlot
after benny pickled the beast his reputation spread all over town
from then on he was known as benny the juet rodriguez
comes down on home plate and vanishes leaving empty
the nickname stuck with him the rest of his life
a roar goes up inside the ballpark
thats a triple and thatll put the winning run on third with two out in the bottom of the ninth
what a shot
from the dugout tommy lasorda calls for a pinch runner
a player comes out of the dugout stripping off his warm up jacket
lasordas sending in a pinch runner and itll be
i dont believe it
lasordas calling up the old man to pinch run in the biggest clutch situation this season
they say the veterans lost a step or two
but if i were you id get ready for some fireworks
is on its feet as year old benny the jet rodriguez takes over third base from the player already there
they shake hands on the exchange
the rd base coach walks over to the jet
pats him on the back
give em hell jet
ill do my best maury
the coach moves into the coaching box
turning his back to us
emblazoned across his jersey is the name w i l l s
takes the signal
leads off rd base ten steps
the pitcher fires to rd
the jet hand tags
fires to rd again
the jet gets back
leads off again
the pitch strike
the catcher tosses it back
the jet moves
so fast that no one knows hes gone till its too damn late
the pitcher awkwardly throws home
the catcher wipes the baseline
the dust clears
the umpire eagle wings the air
the tag missed by two feet
its all over
the crowd jumps to its feet
the dodger dugout is all over the jet
the dodgers win the pennant
the dodgers win the pennant
the jet breaks through his adoring teammates just long enough to give thumbs up to
i dont believe it the old man stole home
the old man year old scott smalls the announcer who returns thumbs up
after a pause the jet stole home
the jet stole home
the jet signs autographs for swarming kids
as the crowds cheering continues and echoes into the past we of the best year old buddies that ever lived
on a makeshit baseball diamond a sandlot
theyre all holding something forward displaying one palm up hand beneath another together like the nine musketeers a baseball
a baseball with a familiar smudge
