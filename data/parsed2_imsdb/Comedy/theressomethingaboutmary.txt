strauss and peter farrelly bobby farrelly story by ed decter john j
strauss its the early s and everyone is arriving at school
we push through the parking lot crowd to a nervous lanky kid ted when i was sixteen years old i fell in love
renise a tough girl with stringy brown hair and a shiny forehead as she turns toward the camera
she barely looks at him as he approaches just drags on her smoke

beat so listen uh i was wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the prom you know with me
renise looks unenthused
ted contd its no big deal whatever i mean if you want
see the thing is i heard a rumor that this guy i like was gonna ask me
im gonna wait and see what happens there
but that sounds great yeah
ted nods confused
beat so is that a yes or a no
i think i was very clear ted
if everything else falls apart maybe
renise throws down her butt and storms off
im gonna hold you to that
a pretty girl mary climbing off a ten speed in the school parking lot
shes athletic and tanned and doesnt have a bad bone in her body
her name was mary
shed moved to our little rhode island town from minnesota two years earlier
she locks up the bike and starts walking toward the school
mary was very smart and very cool and she had a faceful of eyes that promised you a better life if you could only know her
as she approaches the camera we pan to see ted watching her
hes sitting on a picnic table with two friends
hey dirtbud who you going to the prom with
finally ted takes his eyes off mary
ah i dont know if im even gonna
you know not my style

rosey palm your girlfriend
god knows you spend enough fucking time with her
the guys laugh
out of ammo but doesnt know it yeah and who are you gonna take your own palm
his friends stare at him
i like the way you just spun that around on me
friend notices mary talking to her friends
i wonder who shes going with
some guy named woogie
big guy goes to barrington high school
this irks ted
woogie from borrington high
sounds like a loser
woogie was all state football and and basketball and valedictorian of his class
i heard he got a scholarship to princeton but hes going to europe first to model
this takes the wind out of teds sails
yeah and hes got a huge cock
everyone looks at him
friend contd i heard
suddenly friend notices something
hey check it out
a large goofy young man with an unfashionable crewcut comes walking up the street
hes in his early twenties and though the weather is mild hes wearing earmuffs
he approaches a group of kids sitting on a car hood
you seen my baseball
the kids watch as the ear muff guy approaches another group
you seen my baseball
to his buddies this guy must be in the tard squad
to ear muff guy hey buddy come here i think i know where your ball is
the ear muff guy heads back to the car
you seen my baseball
yeah i seen it
that girl over there she has it
car hood kid points to a busty girl leaning against another car talking to her large boyfriend
car hood kid contd cept she doesnt call it a baseball
she has another name for it
the ear muff guy marches up to her and her boyfriend
you seen my pecker
you seen my pecker
the boyfriend grabs him by the collar
you son of a bitch ill kick your ass
the boyfriend throws the ear muff guy to the ground and is about to pummel him when ted intervenes
take it easy smokey
this fucking pervert just came on to nance
all right just be cool
under breath he looks like hes not all there you know what i mean
a crowd starts to gather which only incites smokey more
get the fuck out of my way man
smokey tosses ted out of the way and moves toward the ear muff guy
just then mary shows up and steps between them
whats going on here
she bends down and helps the ear muff guy off the ground
mary contd are you all right
mary you seen my baseball
no i havent seen your baseball
jeez warren you know youre not supposed to leave the yard by yourself
to mary you know him
hes my brother
beat i didnt realize he was
at this smokey and his girlfriend reluctantly head toward the school along with most of the crowd
mary turns her attention in the direction ted was thrown
ted is sitting in a mud puddle
he stands and brushes himself off
thanks a lot ted
he cant believe what hes just heard
as mary helps him up she turns her attention to warren
that she knew my name blew my mind
some of my best friends didnt know my name
mary and a muddied ted are walking warren home
warren lags behind mumbling to himself
mary notices that ted is limping
hey youre limping
did you just hurt yourself
no its an old football injury
oh are you on the team
no a couple of the players and me were joking around and uh i fell off the school
warren approaches and motions for ted to hop on his back
warren come on leave ted alone
warren pats his back again
to mary i dont mind
if you think he can hold me
oh he can hold you
he weighs two hundred and thirty pounds
a real clydesdale huh warren
ted hops onto warrens back
ted contd giddy up
warren walks about five feet and stops
my turn now
off teds reaction we muddy sweat is running down teds face as he struggles up a hill with warren on his back
straining were here warren
you wanna get off
ted rolls his eyes and continues toward the front door
mary looks on amused
so who you taking to the prom
the prom you going
oh i dont know
i think proms are pretty dumb
cause i thought maybe you and i could go if you werent already taking someone
i mean dumb in the sense that they only happen once a year
she smiles at this
from that moment on the guys at school looked at me in a whole new light
youre a fucking liar
ted is leaning against his locker surrounded by a group of guys
you expect us to believe youre going to the prom with mary
what about woogie
they broke up
she said he started getting weird on her
i got twenty bucks says youre full of shit
oh come on why would i lie
because youre a loser and in some warped way this gives you a momentary sense of worth
put me down for fifty
as the others join in we a tuxedoed and smiling ted drives up in his parents station wagon
ted knocks on the door and marys gruff dad answers
what do you want
um hi im ted peloquin
im here to take mary to the prom
youre about twenty minutes late
she just left for the prom with her boyfriend woogie
ted looks devastated
suddenly the door swings open revealing charlie thats mean
come on in ted
dont listen to mr
wise guy here
hes a joke a minute
relieved oh thats a good one
ted nervously enters and sees warren watching t
in the den
warren doesnt look his way
just then mary comes down the stairs looking as if the directors had really taken their time casting this role
ted cant believe his eyes
poor teddy hes been getting it both barrels from the wisenheimer here
dad have you been busting teds chops
marys dad shrugs
mary contd warren did you say hi to ted
not looking up bout ten times
hey warren i think i know where your baseball is
this finally gets warrens attention
you seen my baseball
we see ted discreetly pull a brand new baseball out of his pocket and palm it in his hand
well if its a big white one with red stitching i think i saw it right behind your ear
ted is reaching behind warrens ear when suddenly warren takes a swipe at him knocking him to the ground
ted hits his head on the coffee table
as it rolls under the couch stopping right next to the other missing ball
in a split second warren is up like a cat and dives onto ted
as mary and her parents scream ted manages to free himself from the disabled mans clutches and gets warren in a to ted what the hell are you doing
teddy let him go
out of breath im trying
tell him to
the family jumps on warren and finally break it up
marys dad contd to ted jesus christ guy what the hell were you doing
i was playing a trick
i i i had a baseball
wheres a baseball
ted looks around but theres no ball in sight
there was a ball i had a honest
as mary helps ted up we see that his shirttail is out and his tie is hanging off
marys parents lead the frothing warren back to the couch
mary to ted im sorry
i shouldve told you hes got a thing about his ears
are you all right
to mary honey now youre all wrinkled
mary looks down and frowns
ted will you just give me one more minute
i have to iron this thing
ted starts to tuck his pants in as mary and her mother head back up the stairs
marys dad and ted are left alone
ted rubs his head sees a spot of blood
to marys dad may i use your bathroom
ted dabs his head with a tissue then moves to the toilet
as he takes a leak he glances out the window to his left
two lovebirds are perched on a branch
at the sound of these beautiful tweeties singing their love song for themselves for the spring for ted and mary and suddenly they fly away and we
to reveal mary in the bedroom window directly behind where the birds were in just a bra and panties and just then her mother glances teds way and makes eye
contact with what she can only presume to be a leering peeping tom
he loses the smile and ducks his head back into the bathroom panicking now he hastily zips up his fly and a concerned mary her mom dad and warren are
huddled outside the bathroom
knocking gently ted are you okay
pained just a minute
hes been in there over half an hour
whispering charlie i think hes masturbating
well he was watching you undress with a silly grin on his face
pained i was watching the birds
they all look at one another
charlie do something
all right kid thats it im coming in
a whimpering ted huddles in the corner as marys dad enters
marys dad contd what seems to be the situation here
you shit yourself or something
ted motions for him to close the door and marys dad obliges
ted contd i uh
i got it stuck
you got what stuck
beat oh it all right these things happen let me have a look
its not the end of the world
marys dad moves closer and puts his reading glasses on
as mary her mom and warren listen in
shirley get in here
you gotta see this
no please sir shes a dental hygienist
shell know what to do
marys mom comes in and closes the door behind her
teddy hon are you okay
moving closer seeing the situation would you shhh
marys gonna hear us
just relax dear
what exactly are we looking at here
dizzy what do you mean
delicate i mean is it
gruff is it the frank or the beans
i think a little of both
suddenly we hear warren from outside the door franks and beans
ted hangs his head
mary and warren are huddled outside the door
to warren shhhh
what the hells that bubble
mary reacts to this
how the helld you get the beans all the way up top like that
i dont know
its not like it was a well thought out plan
oh my there sure is a lot of skin coming through there
im guessing thats what the soprano shriek was about pumpkin
im going to get some bactine
suddenly a police officer sticks his head in the bathroom window
humiliated oh god
everything okay here
neighbors said they heard a lady scream
youre looking at him
cmere and take a look at this beauty
no thats really unneces but the officers already climbing in the window
once inside he turns his flashlight on ted and whistles
now ive seen it all
what the hell were you thinking
frustrated i wasnt trying is that bubble what i think it is
marys parents nod
police officer contd but
howd you get the zipper all the way to the top
lets just say the kids limber
the officer makes a face then rolls up his sleeves
well theres only one thing to do
no no no ill be fine
ill just hang my shirttail out and work on it in the morning
look son thisll only hurt for a second
the officer reaches down and takes hold of the zipper
no no please
teddy be brave
beans and franks
warren shhh defeated ted holds his breath and braces for the worst
its just like pulling off a band aid
a one and a two and
we got a bleeder
two paramedics rush ted out the front door on a stretcher
mary runs alongside him holding a towel on his crotch
while a third paramedic dabs at his crotch with a towel
marys mom and dad are out front along with two firetrucks four police cars and a crowd of about thirty neighbors
to mary keep pressure on it
mary does as shes told
running along ted im so sorry
are you going to be okay
irrational cockiness you betcha
he gives her two thumbs up as they slide him into the ambulance
the doors slam shut and as the ambulance pulls away ted starts to whimper and we can see mary fade into the night as we ted now in his s
lays on his therapists couch
anyway school ended a few days later and that july her father got transferred to florida
the up to reveal that the chair behind him is empty
ted has been telling all this to no one ted contd it took me half the summer to pay off all those bets
sighs i never did see mary again
that was about twelve years ago
just then the door quietly opens and teds psychiatrist tip toes back into the room and takes his seat
he has a dab of mustard on his chin and has forgotten about the cloth napkin tucked into his collar
the psychiatrist notices the napkin and quickly wipes his chin then tosses it aside
anyway its not something you exactly forget about but i guess i mustve blocked it out of my head
then about a week ago im driving on the highway and i got to thinking about mary and suddenly i couldnt breathe
i couldnt keep up with the flow of traffic anymore i felt like i was going to die
i pulled into a rest area parked the car and just started shaking
the psychiatrist scratches his chin
rest areas are homosexual hang outs
highway rest areas theyre the bathhouses of the nineties for some gay men
ted thinks about this then glances back at the shrink
what are you saying
checking wristwatch oops times up
well have to delve into that next week
off teds look we ted and his friend dom are blasting a couple buckets
he said you were gay
he implied it
well youre a writer and a lot of writers are gay
look at truman capote
yeah but he was successful
let me ask you this when you smoke a cigar do you ever pretend it has balls
ted appears to think about this
come on that wouldnt make me gay
im going to fix you up with my new assistant
whats he like
dom laughs then watches as ted hits a ball
youre leaving it out
finish your swing
beat youre going to like this one shes half asian half american
i just told you shes half asian
half american theyre all good looking
you could mate don rickles and yoko ono and theyre going to have a gorgeous kid
its a foolproof combo
ted thinks about it
whats the point
lets face it dom im in a slump
lately ive been feeling like
like a loser
dom contd give me a break
remember five years ago when your kidneys failed
if you were a loser would they have been able to find a donor with an exact tissue match
what are the odds of that one in a million
oh so im lucky because my brother got killed in an explosion
i never said that
im saying your lucky those kids found his kidneys
beat besides your brother jimmy never gave a shit about you
ted gives him a look
dom contd you know youre a real glass is half empty guy
you got a fucking guardian angel man
ted manages a small smile
just then teds cell phone rings
i gotta take this it might be my boss
flips phone open ted here
on phone youre a cocksucking motherfucking piece of puke
whoever it is hangs up
without reacting ted closes the phone and puts it back in his pocket
dom and ted are drinking beer while sitting on doms front steps
we see signs of kids everywhere a tricycle six foot basketball hoop dolls etc
doms wife comes out and hands them each a cigar
i thought you guys might like these with your beers
she goes back inside
see thats what i want
i dont need these bimbettes you got me chasing
i want what you have
these guys dont usually talk about this crap and ted gets a little embarrassed
ted contd it must be great with a wife like that
each day is better than the next
beat have you ever been you know
in love with someone
look i admit it was brief but it was definitely love
crushes dont last twelve years
whatever happened to mary
i told you her family moved to miami
i mean since then
i dont know
well why dont you look her up
sarcastic yeah right
because i guarantee shes married and has a couple kids
girls like mary dont stay single
what if youre wrong
you just said shes the only girl you ever loved what have you got to lose by calling her
i did try calling her
sheepish a few years ago
she wasnt listed
so that was it
one bump in the road and you gave up
i also called unsolved mysteries youre kidding
what did they say
they told me they dont help out stalkers
beat look maybe theyre right its been a long time
i got it you hire a private eye fly him out there he follows her around a couple days shell never know a thing
ted considers this
no fucking way
thats too creepy
dom thinks a moment then snaps his fingers
wait a second
theres a guy named healy in my office who might be able to help you out
hes a claims investigator and he goes to miami every couple weeks
as ted thinks about this we of a big insurance company morning ted and dom are walking down a hallway
i dont know about this dom
relax this guy owes me a big one
a couple years ago he got in a jam up in the boston office some bullshit about padding his resume like we havent all done that
anyway they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear jerker letter that ended up on my desk
yeah i guess he still lives with her
seemed like a sweet lady got diabetes or something so i went out on a limb and got him transferred down to providence
and you think he could find out her number for me
hell do better than that
ill send him down to miami on business you throw him a couple bucks on the side and hell track her down
ted thinks about this
dom contd just let me warn you this guy runs a little hot but he gets the job done
ted is seated inside a small cubicle across the desk from patrick healy a shaggy looking guy in a mis matched three piece suit
healy looks more like a used car salesman than an insurance investigator
so dom tells me youre looking for some lady friend you knew in high school
any idea where i might start looking
she moved to miami beach twelve years ago
i checked directory assistance down there and shes not listed
she mightve moved ten times since then
skeptical all you want is a phone number
well i know youre busy dont play games with me ted
i dont know maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a labrador
i dont buy it
you dont buy what
suddenly healy is in his face
ted im the kind of guy who shoots from the hip
now i want you to level with me did you knock this skirt up
shes blackmailing you right
more indignant no
you want her dead dont you
you cant be serious
do you really expect me to believe this is a straight stalker case
im not a stalker
shes a friend of mine
sure she is
thats why she got an unlisted number and you havent heard squat from her in a dozen years
oh youre good ted
youre a real piece of work
stands look lets forget it
lets forget the whole thing
i get one hundred a day plus expenses
laughs at healys nerve you get fifty a day period
its a business trip theyll pay for your expenses
healy thinks about it
okay ted ill do it
but if this chick turns up with a toe tag im rolling over on you
of miami beach healy waits alone on a corner carrying one bag and a rack of beers
suddenly a chrysler lebaron convertible with a great dane in the back screeches to a halt in front of him
the driver sully is a muscular well groomed man in his thirties
healy you dog
checking out car fucking sully
look at you
boston accent you hot shit
ya look fuckin pisser
the dog is catching wind in the backseat and sully hands healy a packet
heres the info you asked for
you should thank me that girl was not easy to find
whatd she scam you out of some insurance dough
nah some guy threw me a few bucks to track down his high school girlfriend
this place is modest and clean but it has a direct view of south beach
healy puts his bags down and looks around
im doing okay
checks watch i gotta get ready for work
sully ducks into the bedroom and healy looks around the apartment
with this pad the killer wheels
looks like you really cleaned up your act
what can i tell you
its a healthier lifestyle down here and its easier to succeed when your heads clear
those guys i worked with back in boston they were a bad influence
hey what do you say we go grab a couple drinks
not for me buddy
i dont drink anymore
yeah and you dont drink any less right
suddenly a huge boa constrictor slithers up on healys lap
healy contd what the
sully comes back in the room wearing a police uniform
take it easy thats bill
tell bill to get the fuck off
smiling relax he just ate
healy just stares at his friend
sully contd proudly nineteen months i been sober
what are you talking about
you were never an alky you were a cokehead
yeah well when you quit blow you gotta quit the booze too
is that right
well good for you sull im proud of you
healy pops open one of his beers and hands it to sully
healy contd here just have one of these then
healy what i just tell you
this is a light beer
you cant have a light beer
no i cant
healy stares at him baffled
sully its one fuckin beer for christ sakes
holds up beer ooh the big bad beers gonna get ya
sully stares at the beer weakening
healy contd im worried about you man
you better learn to have a pop once in a while or youre gonna fall off the wagon
youre being a fanatic and that aint healthy
bet your ass you are
now i dont want to hear anymore of your happy horseshit
you gotta learn how to bend a little or believe me
youre gonna break
finally sully takes the beer
he stares at it a moment and then sips
jesus you know what
this shit doesnt even taste good to me anymore
ah fuck ya then you big pussy
what are you spotting
healy takes the beer from sully and as he chugs it we healy is on a stakeout
hes been here for hours food wrappers litter sullys car
hes wearing walkman type headphones which are connected to a radio surveillance microphone attached to a pair of binoculars
suddenly music explodes through his headphones healys jolted awake
who threw the grenade
recovering healy aims the binoculars toward
healy has a clear unobstructed view into marys apartment
the music is coming from marys clock radio
mary sits up in bed and shakes herself awake like someones just poured cold water over her
she cranks the music even louder
mary hops out of bed wearing only her panties and though shes a little older now she still looks well cast
on healy hes become extremely interested in his work
as much as healys enjoying the show hes got a job to do he speaks into a micro cassette recorder into recorder okay ted i found your mary
her current address two niner eight euclid avenue miami beach
children and labrador negative
extremely nice ass affirmative
mary walks into the living room where we see an old woman magda sitting on the couch listening to a stack of radio scanners
have you been up all night again
bet your ass i have
its an important job neighborhood watch is
is that what you call listening in on strangers phone conversations
these aint strangers theyre neighbors this only picks up signals in a half mile radius
meaning these are the people you live amongst you got a right to know if theyre creeps
for instance did you know theres a guy down the hall cheating on his wife
feigning shock you picked that up on the scanner
we gotta move
confirmed it on the scanner
i knew something was up because puffy used to bark like hell whenever he saw him and you know puffy only barks at bad people
magda pats her little dog puffy on the head
magda puffy barks at everybody
thats because theres a lot of bad people out there
hey puffy tried to warn you about that steve guy you was seeing he was a fucking asswipe but you had to find out for yourself didnt you
okay you win
now try to get some sleep huh
mary gives magda a kiss and heads to her bedroom
as healy follows mary around town
mary exits her apartment and bounces out into the world
there is a homeless man sitting on the sidewalk
mary flips him an apple then jumps in her honda civic and drives off
mary is at the range hitting a couple buckets of balls
watching from the parking lot
into mic looks like we got an athlete on our hands
mary waits in the drive thru lane reading the sports page
finally the window opens and she is handed a huge bag of food
healy watching from his car
into mic well from her figure and her appetite im guessing shes either got a bowel disorder or weve got a hurler on our hands
marys brother warren is wearing a walkman as he plays catch out front with a special ed teacher while several other mentally disabled patients entertain themselves
mary pulls up gets out and starts handing out egg mcmuffins
get in line
one at a time
a fat patient gary approaches
can i have two mary
yeah you can have two halves just like everyone else
gary takes his and walks off
a couple more patients and then bucktoothed freddie steps up to her
will you marry me mary
oh yeah pretty boy
and what about dolores
mary points to another patient staring bashfully at freddie
would you marry us both mary
yeah thatd be a good deal for you wouldnt it
freddie moves off and fat gary is back trying to be inconspicuous
mary contd wow this is weird
there was somebody who looked just like you here a minute ago
mary smiles and hands gary another mcmuffin
into mic ixnay on the big appetite
beat shes just got a big heart
neighborhood restaurant and bar
after work crowd
mary and her friends brenda lisa and joanie are sitting at a table under an umbrella
lisa reads from the personals column in south beach magazine listen to this one seeking sensitive wasp doctor to share candlelit dinners long walks in coconut grove marriage
what does this girl want a corpse
you gotta be more specific seeking deaf mute with three pound cock and trust fund
no it should be a hockey player with great pecs
ugh not pecs
sounds like one of those guys with a fish net shirt and a banana hammock
the bar where we see healy eavesdropping on their conversation
to mary i suppose you wouldnt like someone with a washboard stomach like brad pitt
back on mary and friends
im just saying i dont mind a guy with a bit of a beer belly
it means hes a guy
you can have those pretty boys who hang out in a gym all day staring at their reflections
quietly into mic a girl after your own heart ted
mary and friends
i can live with those reflections
im sick of these calorie countin pansies
give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer and playing thirty six holes and still has enough energy to take me and warren out to a ballgame
sarcastic jeez i dont know where youre ever going to find a guy like that
but heres the rub
the guy im talking about has got to be self employed
you mean like an architect or something
brenda you mean creative but not poor
no its not the money
creative yeah thats good but its the freedom im talking about
see this guy has to have a job he could do anywhere
that way we could just up and leave at the drop of a hat
and where would you and your beer bellied architect be leaving to
i dont know
the super bowl new orleans jazz festival
maybe a couple months in nepal
yeah and youd probably dump the poor guy halfway to katmandu
whats that supposed to mean
it means youre too hard on guys
no im not
oh come off it mare
what about whats his name
you couldve at least passed the baton on that one
the girls laugh
steve was all right for awhile
all right for awhile
the guys good looking rich witty
he was a god
at one point you were talking about marrying him
come on whyd you dump him
mary thinks about this
i dont know it was complicated
hes in san francisco im in miami
dodging question besides magdas psychic dog hated him
is that old crab still with you
mary you said you were putting her up for a month its been a year and a half
ah shes okay
mary cut the crap what really happened with steve
i mean you know my brother
steve seemed to put up with warren
i dont want someone wholl put up with him
i want someone who will enjoy him the way i do
do you know what he told my friend tucker
he said he wouldve popped the question a lot earlier if warren wasnt in my life
beat well he is in my life and im goddamn lucky to have him
the hell with steve
everyone is touched by this
then well thats the last time i blow him behind your back
as the girls laugh we healy sits out front in his car again waiting for mary to get home
he picks up the phone dials a number and someone answers but doesnt speak
beat sully that you
over phone who the fuck is it to you
sully its healy
whats going on over there
sully is sitting on the kitchen floor in his police uniform a ring of white around his nostrils
the room is littered with beer cans he has another one in his hand theres a pile of cocaine and a rolled up bill on the breakfast table
the dog and the snake are in the doorway looking at him with concern
into phone sloshed fuckin patrick healy you think your shit dont stink
well i got news for you youre goddamn right it dont
how the hell are ya
healy looks at the phone concerned
uh im fine
just wanted to let you know ill have your car back in a couple hours im still staking out this girls apartment
you found my car
just then healy notices mary pull up and park
he slides down in his seat
she gets out carrying a bag and approaches the homeless man who is still sitting on the sidewalk
she hands him the bag
you watch out for yourself herb
as mary bounds up the steps of her building we the homeless man as he happily takes a sandwich and soda out of the bag
as mary rushes into the apartment magda is glued to her radio scanner listening intently
jesus mary you gotta hear this some cops staking out this broads apartment
no time magda my shows starting
he can hear the conversation through the surveillance equipment pointed at marys place
this is a good one mare
sounds like his partners all lubed up
quietly into phone call you back
over phone god i miss ya ya fuck healy hangs up abruptly
ah christ i lost em
mary runs into her bedroom shuts the door and flips on the tube just as espn sportscenters opening theme song is playing
relieved mary lays back on her bed and starts watching
mary is now watching andy griffith while smoking a joint and giggling away in bed
hes sitting in his car giggling too
he never learns
as the shows end credits start to whistle away mary stands and starts to undress for bed
he sits up very interested now
into mic here we go teddo
here comes the money shot
healy quickly reaches in the back seat and pulls out a bigger were close on the wrinkliest saggiest droopiest set of milkbags on the planet
healy contd oooof
first chink in the armor teddy boy
healys binocular pov he moves his view up from the tits to reveal
magda undressing for bed
he flinches sickened by his mistake then repositions the binoculars dead left to the next window
moving over to the next window we see
mary as she just finishes putting on some sexy t shirt
as he starts to drool
healy contd oh sweet jesus ted is sitting alone having a beer when a smiling healy approaches
ive got some very very good news for you my friend
perking up very very healy sits down and motions for a beer
i think your lifes about to change
so you found mary

and you were right shes really something
smiles so she hasnt changed
that i couldnt
let me ask you something was she a little big boned in high school
no not at all
well she mustve packed on a few pounds over the years
this doesnt dampen teds enthusiasm
marys a little chubby huh

teds smile starts to fade
healy contd but you know you shit out a bunch of kids youre going to put on a few pounds

shrugs its just that
i wouldnt have thought
anyway the good news is i have all the information you need

you should definitely call her ted
i mean shes a real sparkplug that one
she seems determined to get those rugrats off welfare and with your help ill bet she does it
ted stands and starts moping away
dont you want the name of the housing project
uh thats okay
you sure big guy
ill bet shed love to hear from you before her mastectomy
as ted leaves healy puts his feet up on the table and sits back
we pan across the room of unopened boxes to ted laying awake in bed
we hear head banger music coming from the apartment next door
finally ted gets up and walks over to his dresser
as he flips on a small light we see loose change a balled up kleenex a few golf tees and teds wallet
ted picks up the wallet and opens it
inside is an an old high school photo of a smiling mary
as ted looks at it he cant help but smile too
healys taking his last boxload of crap out of his cubicle when he spots ted
he tries to duck back in but ted sees him
healy forces a smile as ted approaches
what are you doing
oh uh i resigned
ted picks up a plane ticket off the desk
yeah this insurance business is too slow for me
im going to go down and try my hand at jai alai
yeah i dont know why but i always felt at home in the fronton
healy starts walking out of the office and ted follows
healy is having a hard time looking him in the eye
so he doesnt
look uh ive been thinking about everything you told me
well i think youre right i should look her up
are you nuts
but you said she was a sparkplug
i said buttplug
ted sighs and follows healy out the front door
they walk across the lot toward healys car
all the same i still want to call her
i know it sounds crazy mary sure has a lot of troubles in her life but i dont know maybe i can help her out
sighs the poor things had it tough shes in a wheelchair for godsakes
its a goddamn bunion
i thought beat thats not it anyway
i know this doesnt make any sense to you but i just cant turn it off that fast
i still feel something for her
healy comes to his car and puts his stuff in the trunk
okay tell you what ill get her number for you just as soon as she gets back from japan
whats she doing in japan
youve heard of mail order brides
well they go that way too
ted is devastated
marys a mail order bride
fetched a pretty penny too
dont forget its the sumo culture they pay by the pound there
sort of like tuna
off teds look we ted and dom are having a beer and a dog
thats it im making an oath
ill never procrastinate about anything again
life is too fucking short
hey look on the bright side interrupting whats that dom
whats the bright side
at least now you know
i think it was better when i didnt
it was kind of inspiring to know there was someone so pure in the world
as ted dwells on this dom bursts out laughing
whats so funny
im sorry its just that youre taking this all wrong pal
dont you see
youre liberated i feel liberated
i mean here youve been in therapy thinking you blew it with the greatest girl ever and it turns out that getting your dick stuck in your zipper was the
best thing that ever happened to you
ted flinches at this
wait a second i never told you that
christ ted i was only four towns away
ted thinks it over
maybe youre right
i should look on the bright side
i mean ive still got my health
checks watch im out of here
ive got to get up at six a
to move my bosss brother into his apartment
what on your day off
do you even know the guy
never met him
jesus ted youve got to finish that damn novel so you can quit that stupid magazine
amen to that
healy pays for a bucket of balls then takes his clubs and strolls jauntily to
healy places a ball on the tee and takes a swing
he tops the ball and it dribbles about ten yards
hit a house
to mary havent swung the wrenches in a while
healy takes another swing and duck hooks one about fifty yards
mary addresses her ball takes a smooth backswing and healy contd hey can you give me some tips here
she cracks her shot long and straight
yeah dont talk in someones backswing
mary tees up another ball and healy puts down his club
healy contd im gonna get a soda you want one
annoyed no thanks
healy pulls out a huge wad of change from his pocket
do you have change for a dollar
all i have is these stupid nepalese coins
have you been
not in months
i dont even know why i bought the damn place
you own a home there
its just a condo really
right outside katmandu
thats a place ive always wanted to go
is it true the mountains are so tall you cant see the tops
not til you get about three hundred yards from the summit
thats been my experience anyway
she looks impressed
healy looks at his watch
healy contd you know i should just get going
ill work on my game next week
he flips her a coin
healy contd here
spend it on your trip to katmandu
healy starts to walk off
mary doesnt know what to do
will she ever see this guy again
mary contd calls after him it was nice meeting you
healy doesnt answer or turn around
he just raises his hand and gives her a little wave
mary shrugs her shoulders
healy is sitting in sullys chrysler lebaron right next to marys honda civic
he watches the rear view mirror and the moment he sees mary coming out from the driving range he swings his legs out the door and starts changing out of
his golf shoes
as mary tosses her golf bag into the trunk she notices healy tying his shoes
a second chance
well it was nice meeting you again
same here again
by the way whats your name
theres an uncomfortable pause
why doesnt this guy ask the usual questions
dont you want to know my name
i already know it mary
surprised howd you know that
its right there on your golf bag
healy opens the back door to put away his golf shoes
suddenly rolls and rolls of paper come tumbling out
mary bends over to help healy pick them up
what are you doing with all these blueprints
some buildings im working on
well just until i get my pga tour card
mary stares at him mouth agape
healy contd im kidding
yeah i guess you could call me an architect its just a job really a way to keep me moving
my real passion is my hobby
i work with retards
taken aback i beg your pardon
flaps lips with fingers the guys who ride the short bus
put off isnt that a little politically incorrect
the hell with that
no ones gonna tell me who i can and cant work with
no i mean theres this one kid we call him mongo on account of hes a mongoloid
he got out of his cage once and hes in a cage
well its more of an enclosure really
they keep him confined
thats what i said so i went out and got him a leash you know one of those clothesline runners for the backyard
hes got plenty of room out there to dig
the kids really blossomed
now i can take him to ball games movies you know happy stuff
that sounds like fun
yeah its fun for them but its heaven for me
getting emotional those goofy bastards are just about the best thing i have in this crazy old world
checks watch ooh hey i gotta run
won back over look uh i was thinking maybe we should go have dinner sometime
healy smiles at this and we a profusely sweating ted has a dresser on his back and eeks his way toward the front door as his bosss disabled brother catches
up to him in a wheelchair
the man is a quadriplegic who needs to use a mouthpiece to operate his chair
hey shit for brains be careful not to scratch that thing huh
you heard me
you already put a fucking nick in my piano
biting tongue ill try to be more careful
smatter with you
you look like youre fading
the things kind of heavy
what i wouldnt give to know what heavy feels like you insensitive prick
no i just meant
im going to the corner to get a cup of coffee
the bosss disabled brother bites into the mouthpiece and zips away up the sidewalk
ted takes a step
ted glances back toward the street to see a t
news reporter from the channel i team rushing toward him with a news crew on her heels
news reporter contd do you know that youre parked in a handicapped spot
ted is splayed out on a table in obvious pain while dr
lalonde an old high school pal palpates his spine
i see you made the news
angry and embarrassed it wasnt my truck i was helping out a guy in a wheelchair
dubious uh huh
where was he
out getting coffee
yeah thats more or less what the others said too
out getting coffee
supposed to meet him here
picking up my grandma
ted turns and glares at him
lalonde contd im just saying
they sure made you look dumb
a couple big cracks of the neck
bob do you remember mary
from high school mary
yeah i saw her about six months ago at a convention in las vegas
ted sits up
howd you see her at a convention
im an orthopedic surgeon shes an orthopedic surgeon
the doc sighs still able to recall the feeling
lalonde contd what a babe
ted sits up on his elbows
a buckled over ted limps into doms office with a crazed look on his face
marys a babe
my mary shes not in japan shes single and shes got no rugrats
she does have a little gambling problem she plays the football cards a bit too much but shes a babe a surgeon babe
but why did healy
well think about it
ted folds his arms
no you mean
the lazy fuck just didnt bother to look her up
nodding that sneaky prick was probably practicing his jai alai
dom shakes his head
then well then youve got to call her man
fuck calling her
im going down there
while mary gets ready for her date magda sits in front of the radio scanner in her bathrobe with her little dog puffy on her lap
so whos the lucky guy
names patrick i met him at the driving range
hes no steve young
healy listening through his headphones reacts to this
whats he like
i dont know
hes kind of a mook
whats a mook
you know a mookalone a schlep
then why you going out with him if hes a schlep
come on magda its like that movie harold and maude i dont watch the new ones
this ones almost thirty years old
its about a young kid and an old lady who fall in love
thats exactly why i dont watch em anymore its bullshit
why the hell would an old lady go for a young kid
mary smiles at this
the point is love isnt about money or social standing or age its about connecting with someone having things in common kindred spirits
fuck kindred spirits
my little puffy heres gonna tell you all you need to know about this guy in about two seconds flat
if he starts yapping hes a loser if puffys relaxed
well you got yourself a keeper
as healy thinks about this we healy enters the building
healy tiptoes up to marys apartment door
he peeks through the mail slot
puffy is staring at him and growling
healy reaches in his pocket pulls out a valium and a doggy treat
healy shoves the pill into the treats soft center examines it then thinks what the hell and shoves in another one
puffy growls louder
healy pops the treat through the mail slot and listens as the dog devours it
healy looks at his watch then sneaks back outside to wait a few minutes for the drugs to kick in
healy is sitting on marys couch with puffy spread eagled upside down on his lap knocked out cold
mary and magda look on in amazement
baby talk oh pufferball likes his little tum tum rubbed doesnt he now
wow ive never seen him like this
he doesnt usually like guys
you mean he doesnt like bad guys that right
he can tell youre an animal nut
you are arent ya
truth is i usually get along better with animals than with people
in nepal the villagers call me kin tan tee which means man who is loved by many animals
babbling who love him a lot too
and so on
magda stares dreamily at healy smitten
would you like a glass of tea or something
you got a brew
noticing magdas trance uh magda why dont you get some more cheese and crackers
oh yeah of course dear
the two women go into the kitchen and healy is left to pet the motionless dog
suddenly healy notices that the dog is a little too motionless
healy checks puffys pulse
he looks at his watch to time the rate
calling out sorry pat out of beer
you like vodka
calling out great
he starts shaking the dog but puffy doesnt move
healy goes into action
he starts pressing on his heart performing doggie cpr
one and two and three he continues trying to revive him
calling out would you like a little clam dip honey
calling out no thanks
panicking love a little bundt cake if you have some
magda and mary are on their way out the door when they stop
shrugs must have a sweet tooth
see if you can find some cookies
as magda starts to go through the cupboards
a panicked healy is giving the little mutt mouth to mouth now
then back to the heart the mouth the heart the mouth
quietly desperately to puffy come on man stay away from the light
healy resumes blowing into the dogs snout pumping his chest with no results
desperate he picks up the cheese knife and quickly slices the wires on two table lamps
healy grabs the two wires and touches them together like a defibrillator on the little poochs chest
the dog bounces a couple feet off the couch as healy takes his pulse again
he zaps him once more with the live wires
healy gets to his feet and peeks into the kitchen
when he turns his back we see puffy ignite in when healy turns back hes horrified at what he sees
he grabs a vase of flowers and pours the water on the burning dog
with this puffy flinches and comes to gasping for air
all i had was some funny bones how does that sound honey
healy picks up the stunned pooch and swaddles it in a blanket as magda enters the room followed by mary
petting dog fine
here you go
sniffs whats that smell
mary hands healy his vodka and as he downs it we healy looks slightly disoriented as mary leads the way into the courtyard area by the main building
i thought we were going out to dinner
we will but first i have a surprise
the architecture exhibit
my friend tucker is going to be here
hes an architect too
you guys will have tons to talk about
as he starts to panic
mary and healy walk through the exhibit area
mary scans the room for her friend
healys face is ashen
i know hes around here someplace
chipper what say we get outta here and go crush a bucket
we just got here thirty seconds ago
isnt this stuff great
mary points to an architectural model
mary contd is this one art deco or art nouveau
would you call that a portico or a vestibule
when you look at architecture try not to concern yourself with the pieces look at the building in its totalitarianism
mary gives him a look
suddenly healy draws a couple of invisible sixshooters at her
healy contd stone crab time
come on lets get outta here goofy
he turns to go but mary notices something o
mary leads healy over to her friend tucker a distinguished looking man in his fifties
healy looks like a dog thats being dragged to the vet
mary and tucker embrace
still hugging come on like you mean it
mary laughs and hugs tucker tighter
then tucker this is my friend pat healy
healy and tucker shake hands
pleasure to meet you patrick
pats an architect too
hey no kidding
where are your offices
keeping cool mainly i work out of boston
did you get your degree up there
yes yes i did get my degree up there
pleased did you study under kim greene
kim and i are close friends
well ill tell her i ran into you
you mean him
healy makes a hand gesture to imply that kims sexuality is in doubt
really but hes been married for twenty years theyve got six kids
nice smokescreen isnt it
tucker can hardly believe his ears
pat does projects all over the world
impressed where would i have seen your work
have you been to thinking hard lets see santiago chile
i was there twice last year
which building is yours
do you know the
did you build the estadio olympico
just down the street the amigo tower
im sorry im not familiar with it
uh sort of nouveau deco
with a big vestibule
check it out next time youre up there
tucker starts to look a little suspicious
you know i really should take your card
noticing something oh look its doob
will you excuse me a minute tucker
healy drags mary across the room toward a man whos looking at an exhibit
to man dooby you old sheep fucker
how the hell are ya
my names mel
anyone ever tell you you look just like jim dubois
healy shrugs and the man walks away angrily
a two door toyota tercel flies by the camera
a determined ted is cruising along the highway in his rent a car
he has a cup of coffee in his hand and a hitchhiker in the seat beside him
the hitchhiker sits with a large red duffel bag between his legs
thanks for picking me up
no prob i could use the company
ive been on the road going on fifteen hours straight
i know how you feel i been standing in the same spot for the last five hours
you know its against the law to pick up a hitchhiker in this state
that must make it tough
so whats up
you some kind of salesman or something
well i am
a salesman thats what i am
i mean im gonna be anyway
im starting my own company video sales just as soon as i get enough seed money
good for you
yeah you wouldnt believe my idea its a home run
you ever hear of eight minute abs the exercise tape
sure ive seen it on two million copies it sold last year
two million man but not next year my ideas gonna blow them outta the water
get this dramatic pause seven minute abs i see where youre going
big smile think about it
you walk into a video store and you see eight minute abs and right next to it you see seven minute abs which one you gonna spring for
id go with the seven
especially since we guarantee youll get every bit as good a work out
how do you guarantee that
well its the company motto if you aint happy well send you the extra minute
that sounds great
beat unless someone else comes out with six minute abs
ted chuckles but the hitchhiker just glares at him unamused
ted contd unaware im gonna pull over
i gotta take a leak
the toyota tercel pulls in and parks
ted gets out and walks into the bushes to whiz
as he steps into the dark brush unzipping his fly he trips over something and falls to the ground
suddenly whoosh whoosh whoosh several huge spotlights illuminate the area revealing scurrying to pull their pants up all around him
a startled ted on his knees directly in front of another man making it appear that hes been blowing the guy
reveals a dozen police officers holding the spotlights and moving in for the arrests followed by a camera deer caught in headlights wait a second its not what you think
a guy with his pants at his ankles jumps on the bandwagon
i i i was just pissing
ted glares at him
i was pissing
yeah ill bet you all were
come on in the truck
as they grab ted and the others and hustle them away we the hitchhiker sitting in the toyota watching the raid unfold
the hitchhiker is clearly panicky at the sight of all the cops
quietly he opens the car door ducks down and then sprints away as the bust continues
each of the men cover their faces as they pass by the camera except for ted who is extremely visible
to cop okay take it easy you dont have to push
a shocked dom and his wife watching this on their television
oh my god
matter of fact told you he was gay
the cops struggle to get the feisty ted into a police van
i was taking a leak
well be right back with more of our special edition of healy and mary are walking home at the end of their date
healy is eating a big wild cone of cotton candy and drinking a beer
that grandmother of yours shes really something
shes not my grandmother actually she rents the apartment right next to mine
her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesnt like to be alone
and it doesnt cramp your style
well except for the lint
yeah i think its that dog of hers running around on the rug all day just makes for a lot of lint
look at this
mary lifts her shirt revealing a big clump of cotton candy mary contd see
thats just one day
healy cracks up and then gazes at her
what a babe
you know sometimes i wish i could be like magda and not go home
id like to just bounce around for awhile do a little traveling
why bounce when you have your own condo in nepal to go to
its clear healy forgot about that one
ah id sell that
start fresh in a new place quit the architect game slow things down read more books see more movies
youre a movie buff
try to be
its tough going with the crap they make today
if dumb and dumber s the best theyve got to offer i say thanks but no thanks
have you seen it
but the boston globe critic jay carr hated it
a fucking moron
i guess i just wish they made them like they used to
you know something like the heartbreak kid or harold and maude mary cant believe her ears
harold and maude is my all time favorite movie
come on dont bust my chops
i know its corny but i do love it
pat im not kidding
i really think its the greatest love story of our time
is this guy for real
i thought i was the only one
they come to her apartment building and stop
it gets a little awkward
i guess this is it huh
well ill see ya
healy turns to go but stops
healy contd mary ah forget it
no forget it it was stupid
come on what were you going to say
nah really it was moronic
she grabs him by the shirt playfully
just say it
healy takes a deep breath
could i feel your bosoms before i go
mary just stares at him
mary beat knock yourself out
healy reaches out and cups her breasts
he doesnt kiss her she doesnt kiss him he just fondles her breasts
then okey dokey so tomorrow night
she smiles and as healy walks away we ted is sitting alone at a table in a small interrogation room
to reveal that he is being observed through a two way mirror by two detectives franek and cavallo
man they never look like youd expect
thats probably how he got the victim to drop his guard
whered they find the body
in a big red bag on the front passenger seat
all hacked up fucking gruesome a real psycho this one
the detectives enter the room
ted stands as the detectives take a seat across from him
agitated im telling you i did not solicit sex
i was just stopping to go the bathroom next thing i know i tripped over something well someone and poof theres cops and lights and okay calm down ted we
beat the problem is we found your friend in the car
as ted sits back down the detectives just stare at him
finally ted thinks he gets it
thats what this is all about
ted puts his head in his hands and smiles
ted contd isnt that just my luck i get caught for everything
so you admit it
guilty as charged
im not gonna play games with you
i could give you a song and dance but whats the point
i did it and we all know it
laughs the hitcher himself told me its illegal the irony
the detectives are surprised by his forthrightness
well uh can you tell us his name
jeez i didnt catch it
the detectives flinch at his glib demeanor
so he was a stranger
it was totally random
confused he was the first hitcher i saw what can i tell you
now cut to the chase how much trouble am i in
the detectives look at one another
first tell us why you did it
why i did it
scoffs i dont know
i thought i was doing the guy a favor
the detectives look at each other
this wasnt your first time was it ted
how many we talking
i dont know fifty
a hundred maybe who keeps track
finally detective cavallo explodes across the table and starts wailing on a shocked ted
youre gonna fry
mary pulls up in her honda civic
she parks out front and enters the building
healy is parked in his car
his surveillance equipment is pointed toward marys office
mary walks into the office and sees a medical assistant standing near the coffee maker
good morning doctor
your friend tuckers in your office to see you
mary nods and heads toward her office
mary walks into her office and sees tucker seated at her desk
shot from behind tucker so we only see the back of his head
whats up doc
tucker you look different some how
did you do something with your hair
tuckers got two tongue depressors under his upper lip making him look like a walrus
the teeth the teeth
i got em capped
oh yeah they look great
hes got his listening gun fixed on marys office
you dont think theyre too big
no no the bigger the better
beat but i must say they could be a little brighter
nothings sexier than a mouthful of pearly whites
healy looks at his teeth in the mirror
not exactly pearly
tucker pulls the tongue depressors out of his teeth and laughs
he stands up and when mary tries to squeeze past him he gives her a kiss on the cheek
you ever been laid in this office
mary pushes past him
behave yourself tucker
smiles come on what are you doing here
she sits in her chair and leans against her desk
i wanted to talk to you about your friend patrick
healy almost flies out of his seat
hes a nice guy isnt he
well thats what im trying to figure out
how long have you known him
tucker has a look of concern
not long at all but i really like him
off tuckers look okay i know hes a little different tucker but thats what i like about him
hes a guy
a real guy
he dresses like a dork and eats corndogs and he isnt always politically correct and he probably farts too
and thats okay with me
thats what youve been looking for a farter
ive been looking for a guy not one of these south beach pussies
look its just that something about him struck me as odd last night
he gave me this funny vibe
anyway i called some friends back east
they dont know of any architect named patrick healy and hes not listed as a harvard alumnus
healy slams his hand on the steering wheel
i thought so
anyway i hope you dont think im being meddlesome
i just think you should be careful with this guy
concerned no no no tucker thank you
i mean lets face it mary youre beautiful youve got money you trust people im just saying theres a lot of psychos out there
small smile i appreciate you looking out for me
detective franek as he speaks sheepishly
his remorseful looking partner cavallo stands behind him
on behalf of the entire south carolina law enforcement community i would like to offer our heartfelt apologies for any pain or temporary inconvenience we may have caused you mr
reveals that ted is lying on his prison bed being spooned by a pound sleeping inmate
the two detectives and an apoplectic ted walk down the hallway
at exactly this morning a man was apprehended not far from where you were arrested
he was identified as an escaped mental patient and subsequently confessed to the murder that you were being held for
lab tests confirmed a fingerprint match on the bag
im free to go
detective cavallo stops and holds out his hand
no harm no foul
stunned i guess
still traumatized ted shakes the mans hand then mopes toward the door
by the way theres somebody here to see you
dom is driving a bruised and somber ted is in the passenger seat
you are one lucky sonofabitch you know that
didnt they tell you
that hitcher was just about to cut your throat when you stopped to take a leak
you got a fucking horseshoe up your ass man
yeah feels like it
ted grimaces and shifts in his seat
ted contd how the hell did you get here anyway
beat told my wife i was going to a promise keepers convention
ted gives him a look
dom contd i hate to ruin your day ted but i have some bad news for you
remember our friend healy
well i didnt know where to mail his last paycheck so i sent my assistant by his mothers apartment
turns out there is no diabetic mom
landlord said shes been dead for ten years
and this adversely affects me how
dont you see
healy lied to us about everything the landlord said when he got back from miami he kept talking about falling for some doctor named mary
ted is stunned
my mary mary wouldnt go for him
dom hands ted a slip of paper
his address in miami
you know when you think about it we really dont know the first thing about this guy
finally the implications of this dawn on ted
jesus christ what have i done
a confused mary and her girlfriends are in the apartment while magda listens to the radio scanner in the b
youre not seriously thinking about going out with this guy again
mary he sounds like a psycho
would you hens quit ya cackling and let her do what she wants to do
puffy liked him and puffys never wrong
the girlfriends roll their eyes
mary the guys full of shit
what if hes not
what if tucker just made an honest mistake
what if he didnt
its clear that mary is torn
i dont know how i can bail now hes going to be here any minute
well then blow him off when he gets here
but you didnt meet him
he seems so i dont know
he has a big cock doesnt he
mary shoots brenda a look
hey hey what did you say pats last name was
magdas eyes almost come out of her head
i think you better listen to this
magda turns up the volume on her scanner and we can clearly hear healy talking on his cellular phone
mary and her girlfriends gather around
so where the hell are you healy
ah i got a date tonight with that mary girl i told you about
the girls all look at one another
we hit the motherlode
we shouldnt be listening to this
she still think youre a fucking architect
mary starts to feel like a fool
edgy turn it up magda
hey watch your mouth shes a great gal
im the dumbshit for lying to her
why didnt you just tell her the truth
i dont know
it just seems that women today are more impressed by the mighty buck than by some schmo who spent the last seventeen years scraping by on peace corp wages
the girls all seem moved by this
healy is parked out front the phone in one hand a script in the other as he listens to sully read the following words but jesus pat if shes as
special as you say shes going to want to hear about the things you did
dismissing this ahh
a disheveled and wired looking sully is sitting on the couch in his underwear reading from the same script
theres coke on the table dog shit on the floor and flies everywhere
in the b
we see the great dane sniffing at his empty bowl and the boa constrictor sprawled out on the floor barely moving
reading come on you could tell her about the irrigation ditches you dug in sudan the orphan babies who cried in your arms in romania
does a line of blow the hope you gave freddie the leper in calcutta
suddenly the dog snatches the page out of his hand and starts to mary and friends
welling up i love this man
magda folds her arms and gloats
look i did all those things for myself
ill be honest with you im a selfish prick
i get a high from helping all of gods creatures
an honest to goodness high
just then healy sees a bug on the car window and instinctively squashes it
he has the phone wedged between his cheek and shoulder as he struggles with the dog to get the script
sully still cant retrieve the script nor his next line
winging it thats bullshit man you uh you were on the front line
remember the uh malaria the uh typhoon fever that vicious strain of genital herpes
they flinch at this
he stares at the phone horrified
i cured a lot of nasty illnesses in third world countries
as they let out a sigh
contd the bottom line is im not going to use my philanthropy as some form of currency
especially after what i did
i lied to this poor girl
she deserved better
hey love will make you do fucked up things
you said it mister
choking up i gotta go
as he hangs up the phone and does another line we the great dane hal as he looks around for something anything to eat
he sniffs at a sock then a beer bottle before finally setting his sights on the boa constrictor bill
bill glances the dogs way nervously senses trouble and wiggles his way into another room
as hal takes off after the snake we healy starts to knock on marys door but before he can the door suddenly swings open revealing a beaming mary
startled oh mary
look theres something i have to tell you
im not before he can finish mary steps forward and their mouths meet in a passionate kiss
as mary watches healy plays touch football with warren and a few of his friends
healy catches a pass then trying a little too hard to impress mary he delivers a forearm shiver to his defender and gives warren a vicious straight arm
when healy gets into the end zone he spikes the ball and starts talking trash to another defender
healy shows up at marys door sporting a set of oversized incredibly white capped teeth
he gives her a big horse smile and she reacts uncertainly
healy is in marys apartment as mary finishes dressing for a night on the town
you look great
beat hey mare do i have a rip in the back of these pants
when she puts her head close to inspect his pants he lets fly a thunderous fart
she pulls her head away repulsed but healy just mary and and the horse toothed healy are having dinner in a romantic restaurant
as he eats he tells an animated story but hes having trouble with the new choppers and chunks of food are spraying out of his mouth with every word
mary has to bob and weave to avoid being covered with debris
healy and warren are playing monopoly
when warren isnt looking healy cheats and puts a couple hotels on boardwalk
in the b
we see one of warrens buddies fall out of a palm tree
a lovesick healy is mauling mary out on the sidewalk in front while warren stands off to the side listening to a walkman
reveals a devastated ted and dom watching this from teds car
sighs lets go home
youve gone through way too much to back down now
get over there and do something i cant stand watching this
as healy starts over doing it and mary has to break it off
whoa whoa hows my stomach taste
hows my stomach taste she says
shakes head hey thanks for picking up the lunch tab mare
sorry i forgot my wallet

ted recognizes warren

suddenly we see warren perk up at something
franks and beans
jesus i think her brother spotted me
they both duck down in their seats
beans and franks

healy winks at mary
healy reaches over and lifts a headphone off warrens ear

healy contd urrggghh
as they flinch
back on mary et al healy holds his throat clearly in pain

healy contd raspy to mary not to worry

mary watches with a look of concern as healy gets in his car and drives off
ted stares gazily

mary and warren start to go in the apartment

mary turns around and sees ted

ted gets out of the car and hustles across the street toward mary

ted is devastated to hear this
mary contd by the way hows he doing

ted pantomimes an explosion

smiles god i cannot believe im standing here with mary jenson

anyway when i got out of princeton i changed my name as a precaution
that sounds awful
hey what do you say we go out to dinner tonight catch up on old times

ted doesnt know how to respond to this and then she smiles
mary contd im kidding
id really love to ted but the thing is i already have plans
how about tomorrow night
mary we havent seen each other in twelve years
beat dont make me wait another day
mary seems touched by this
tell me where youre staying
ill pick you up at eight
ted finally smiles and we a content healy is parked out front of marys apartment absently listening to her spill her guts to magda while he reads the newspaper
im buying bananas tonight
back when i was your age i always used to make myself a big banana split after sex
i think youre gonna need one tonight
dont get ahead of yourself
youll probably need it before i will
mary is skipping around the apartment while magda sits on the couch
dont bet on it
last time i had a pap smear the guy needed leather gloves and an oyster shucker
so maybe i could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies
knock it off pollyanna just cause youre in love doesnt mean everyone else has to be
come on i wouldnt call it love
i aint seen you beaming like this since you broke ninety on the blue monster
hes reveling in it all
well i am pretty psyched
i ran into a guy today i hadnt seen since high school
healy loses the smile and sits up
an old flame
ted peloquin one of the sweetest guys in the world
healy turns up the volume
mary contd he was so shy and clumsy
i had a major crush on him
as he nearly puts his head through the roof
he grabs hold of the steering wheel and pounds his head on it
contd were gonna go out tonight
oh that reminds me ive got to call whats his face and cancel
do i sense a chill in the air
mary sits down
oh magda i let my head get in the way of my love life
i always pick guys on what i feel in here
pats heart but with this pat guy my head kept saying grow up mary
you have a lot in common with this one youll grow to feel something for him
but it never happened
he couldnt look more crushed
suddenly his cellular phone rings
he stares at it for two three four rings
then he answers it
jovial voice hey patty boy here
sorry i missed ya but im out rustling up some champagne and roses in preparation for the greatest birthday of my life
hope you and yours are having a good day too
healy makes a beep sound and then holds his breath
she stares at the phone feeling cornered
uh hi pat its me mary
just wanted to say im
looking forward to tonight
she hangs up
you vicious bitch how do you sleep at night
i cant do it i just found out its his birthday
sighs i guess ive gotta cancel on ted
he blows imaginary smoke off an imaginary gun
then he sits back and smugly listens to her dial the phone
but then he hears something that concerns him a knock on the door and the dog she puts down the phone and answers the door
its tucker the architect
come on in
pulling his hair out
hes on an emotional roller coaster heading downhill
well look whos here
tucker is carrying an unopened bottle of scotch and absently flicking the yapping pooch off his ankles
there she is i brought you a little thirst quencher mag
oh you are sweet
no im not
i just want to get you drunk so youll pass out and i can have my way with mary
can i pour you one
thanks but ive got to be going
unfortunately doc this isnt a social visit
tuckers tone shifts and mary grows concerned
ive got a little more news about your friend healy
mary seems relieved
i know what youre going to say but he already told me everything
i know hes not an architect
tucker pulls out a piece of paper
tucker contd i think youd better sit down
tucker i appreciate you doing all this but im really strapped for time here and mary the mans a killer
he cant believe his ears
as she lowers herself onto the couch
ive got a friend in the boston police department
he faxed me this this morning
ill just give you the highlights
reading from rap sheet after a short stint as a petty thief patrick r
healy graduated to armed robbery by the age of fourteen
at sixteen he committed his first murder a pretty teachers aid named molly pettygrove
he was incarcerated until age twenty two when despite a grim psychological profile the state was forced to release him
in his mid twenties and again in his early thirties he was suspected of homicides in the states of utah and washington
unfortunately the bodies were so badly decomposed that there wasnt enough evidence to hold him and on and on and so forth and so on
mary looks like shes going to throw up
he listens intently his face ashen
puffy get over here
we hear the pitter patter of the dogs nails on the floor then a loud thump followed by a yelp
the little shit lied to me about that guy
mary picks up the startled dog and pets him
growing emotional i cant believe this is happening
im supposed to be meeting him in an hour
okay just calm down
its going to be okay
tucker puts his arms around her
why you two never hooked up is beyond me
mary looks fondly at tucker
magdas right im so lucky to have you in my life
dont get all gooey on me now youll give me a big head
smiles the important thing doctor is youve got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off
okay i think i know what to do
ill call him right now
he looks stunned
his cellular phone rings
he stares at it then picks it up
hi im out drinking champagne and roses
and im really happy
leave a message
nervous uh hey buddy
oh boy am i pissed
youre not going to believe this well youll believe it theres no reason not to but i just got beeped for emergency surgery
well um sorry but im going to have to bail on you
as we hear a click healy stares at the cell phone seething
tucker comes out the front door looks around then walks off down the sidewalk
on healy his steely gaze fixed on tucker
under breath youre gonna pay fucker
healy discreetly pulls out and slowly follows tucker in his car
he continues down the sidewalk looking back once or twice apprehensive
he rounds a corner then stops next to an old ford pinto
he looks around nervously again
then tucker ducks into the drivers seat and drives off
healy pulls into traffic and follows
doms mixing a drink while ted paces nervously
oh god im fucking nervous
i dont know if im ready for this man
have you hit the cash machine
pats his back pocket got cash
plenty of gas
copped a tin of altoids at the car wash
dom nods satisfied
okay sounds like youre all set
just clean the pipes and its a go
you know clean the pipes
what are you talking about
you jerk off before all big dates right
tell me you jerk off before your big dates
ted just stares at him
dom contd incredulous you dont jerk off before
are you crazy
thats like going out there with a loaded gun
no wonder youre nervous
ted considers this
dom contd think about it after youve had sex with a girl and the two of you are laying in bed are you nervous
im usually too tired to be
dom makes a game show buzzer sound
its because you aint got the baby batter in your brain any more
thatll fuck with your head that stuff will
starting to believe huh
the most honest moment in a mans life is the five minutes after hes blown a load
thats a medical fact
and its because youre no longer trying to get laid
youre actually thinking like a girl
they love that
jesus christ youre right
you bet your ass im right
you dont go out with a loaded gun you empty the barrels
shakes his head holy shit ive been going out with a loaded gun
people get hurt that way
dom walks out of the lobby just as another cab arrives and mary gets out
he sees and her and ducks behind a bush as she walks past him
ted has a newspaper splayed out on the counter open to the bra ads as he furiously flogs the dolphin chest high side view
we see some balled up tissue nearby
after several frantic strokes he takes a deep breath and slowly and loudly exhales clearly having completed his mission
he draws a few more breaths picks up a face cloth and goes to clean up
but somethings missing the load
ted looks down checks his hands pants shoes looks in the sink finally glances at the ceiling with no luck
the load is missing thats when the doorbell rings
ted couldnt look more horrified
as he buckles his pants he makes a last panicky reconnaissance of the area
the doorbell rings again and ted reluctantly goes to answer it
ted opens the door and mary is standing there looking as lovely as ever
you look great
she notices something
mary contd whats that
on your ear youve got something
a huge load is hanging off of teds earlobe like a drop earring
mary contd it looks like a gob of
mary leans forward for a closer look
ted is terrified
mary contd making face is that
oh great i ran out
before ted can stop her mary grabs the load off his ear and wipes healy is still following tucker in his car
finally tucker stops in front of a lavish victorian home and gets out carrying a pizza and wearing a pizza delivery hat
healy screeches to a sideways stop jumps out and pounces on him
healy contd you motherfucker youre a dead man
tucker drops the pizza as healy slams him into a tree
cowering okay pat take it easy dont do anything stupid
who the fuck do you think you are making up that bullshit about me
healy slams him against the tree again
whoa whoa i dont know what youre talking about
maybe thisll jog your memory
healy slaps him across the face
healy contd ill give you a hint its got something to do with me being a murderer
healy raises his arm again and tucker tries to shield himself
okay okay i mightve gotten some bad information
healy grabs him by the collar
that stalker ted got to you right
youre working for him arent you you little shit
healy throws tucker to the ground and takes off his sport coat
this is your last chance you fuck
now either you come clean or im going to kick your ass from here to tallahassee
healy grabs tucker by the hair and cocks his arm
tucker suddenly gets emotional
healy stops and looks at him
you heard me goddamnit
i love her
healy slowly lets go
tucker contd im a phony just like you man
what do you mean
i mean im a fucking fraud
im no architect
dont be a putz whos been to santiago twice in a year
scoffing estadio olimpico please
but you knew people at harvard
i knew shit
the only thing i knew was that you were a fake and i made up everything else
sighs my real names norm
i deliver pizzas
tucker rolls his eyes and pulls out his pizza delivery badge with him pictured beside the name norman plante
as healy lets this sink in we teds rolling a little wine around in a glass
he takes a sip nods his approval
thanks thats great
the waiter turns to mary
the light puffy bangs that mary started the night with are gone replaced by a glazed ace ventura style wave up front
the waiter pours her a glass and leaves
now by killer you mean
i mean he murdered someone and did time back in boston
the guys a freak
stunned jeez mary
well lucky for me i found out
thank god i have friends like tucker
beat look im sick of talking about stalkers
big smile lets talk about you
healy and tucker are bonding over a beer
so then in i went back to dade community college for a semester and when the wal mart cashier job fell through i hooked up with the pizza barn
and you met mary how
just dumb luck
i delivered a pie to her one night and she answered the door in her nightgown that was it for me
i went home that night shaved my beard and a week later i was laid out in her office with a broken back
howd you manage that one
matter of factly friend
oh yeah the plan was going along just fine until you showed up
hey hey hey im not the one who started telling bald faced lies about the competition thats crossing the line
the day you first laid your oily rap on my future wife you started a war
future wife get real man youre nothing more than a glorified brother in her eyes
why you son of a tucker grabs healy by the jacket
okay calm down calm down the bottom line is neither of us are going to get her if we dont do something about that headcase shes with now
as tucker slowly releases him we ted and mary are eating corndogs at the snack bar
you hit the ball pretty good for a fourteen
shrugging no short game
we should play some time
i mean if you can afford to lose some money
smiling what are you
bullshit a twenty two doesnt carry a one iron dont sandbag me lady
mary smiles coyly
okay sometimes im a nineteen
thats more like it
to counter man two more nitrate sicles please
you got it
mary is amused by this
nitrate sicles i like that
i say they should put more meats on a stick you know
they got a lot of sweets on sticks popsicles fudgesicles lollipops but hardly any meat
i agree there should be more
the counter man hands each of them another corndog
you know what id like to see
meat in a cone
you could put corned beef hash in a cone or chopped liver
i like it
and think of the toppings cheese mushrooms mint jelly not to mention ketchup and hot peppers
they smile at one another
its too bad you dont live down here ted
weve got a lot in common
ted takes a chance
why dont you move back
ah my roots here are too deep
i love my practice the people i work with warrens got a nice thing going joking why dont you just move down here and marry me
mary smiles and ted laughs
perhaps a little too hard
ted and mary are sitting on her front stoop smoking a bone
so youre a writer
trying to be
well good for you
i bet it works out for you
if it doesnt what the hell at least i gave it a shot
and the good thing is you can do it anywhere
what about you mare
how the helld you manage to stay single
i dont know
my friends think im too picky
i think im just a weirdo magnet
i did come close once just last year in fact
there was this guy he lived in san francisco
the corner of building
we see healy and tucker spying on them from the shadows
that stalkin son of a bitch
healy and tucker duck back into the alley
healy is throwing doggie treats through an open third floor we hear the television and see magda dozing on the couch with a watery cocktail in her hand and the
dog puffy at her feet
suddenly a doggie treat flies through the window landing on the rug
puffy snaps to attention and approaches the treat
he sniffs it then gobbles it up
another doggie treat lands beside him and he eats that too
tucker keeps throwing the treats up and healy looks concerned
how many is that
that seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch you sure it wont kill him
i never said that
as tucker throws another
the doggie treat lands in magdas cocktail waking her up
magda looks around gets her bearings and then downs the drink
mary and ted still sitting on the stoop
mary seems a little reflective
and then it was all over
we havent spoken since
thats too bad
he sounds almost perfect
beat you want to come up and watch sportscenter
i think im gonna get out while im ahead
mary looks a little disappointed
youre not that far ahead
look mary the truth is
ill be in town for a while now but i dont think we should see each other for a few weeks
alarmed why not
to be honest
im really crazy about you and its making me nervous and when i get nervous im not myself and im afraid im going to doing something really dumb before we
get started so i think i should just lay back until i regain my composure
mary sort of smiles
thats really sweet ted but you should save it for one of your books
all right lets go
ted jumps up and starts up the stairs two at a time
as ted and mary enter we see magda holding up the couch with one hand and vacuuming with the other
mary doesnt know what to make of it
magda what are you doing
magda turns off the vacuum and we hear a banging sound coupled with the o
muffled yapping of puffy
oh hi hon
just straightening up
ah he was being a pest so i put him in the bathroom
as the o
yapping and banging continues magda picks up the television and starts dusting the tv stand
to ted concerned um ted i need a moment with magda would you let the dog out of the bathroom
ted walks down the hall following the yapping and banging sound until he comes to the bathroom door
the yapping is much louder now and he notices something that makes him hesitate
the bottom part of the door is being dented outward from the force of something battering it from within
calling out uh mare what kind of dog is puffy
calling out toy poodle
ted thinks about this shrugs and opens the door
baring his teeth like a rottweiler puffy springs at teds jugular
ted stumbles back into the living room with the hopped up dog on his face
he knocks over a lamp tumbles onto the floor and fights for his life
mary and magda scream as ted and puffy mix it up on the floor
ted tries to crawl toward the door but puffy grabs the cuff of his of teds anguished face as he gets pulled back into the room
ted manages to get the dog in a headlock
stop it youre hurting him
out of breath tell him
to calm down
puffy gets a piece of teds wrist and ted screams and drops him
both man and toy poodle spring to their feet
they start circling one another
puffy leaps at ted and ted smacks him into a wall
unfazed the dog gets a running start and leaps ted manages to duck and puffy flies out the open window
ted and warren are at the top of a giant water slide warren motions that he has decided this is not for him
ted shoots him a look that makes warren feel like a sissy
convinced its not too dangerous warren decides to go for it and ted follows
at the bottom of the slide ted splashes into the huge pool of water laughing having a blast
then he looks around
no sign of warren
concerned ted dives underwater and a moment later resurfaces clutching a gasping warren
mary pumps warrens stomach as he coughs water out of his mouth
ted looks on sheepishly
ted and warren walk down a city sidewalk
as they pass a shop warren points to the window excitedly
in the window there is a mannequin dressed in a super hero outfit i
a generic superman
warren then pulls ted into the store
ted comes out followed by a beaming warren dressed in the super hero outfit
they continue walking again and a few steps later warren excitedly points to another shop window
in the window is a mannequin dressed in a cowboy outfit i
lone ranger hat badge holster chaps vest boots spurs etc
again warren pulls ted into the store
mary is window shopping with a few bags in hand
she turns and reacts amused
warren is now dressed in the cowboy outfit and a humiliated ted follows dressed in the loose fitting super hero outfit
ted and mary are walking arm and arm on a scenic pier where people are fishing
right behind them are magda and herb the homeless guy enjoying one anothers company
ted is on top of the world feeling good looking good right up until he gets the hook in his mouth
suddenly he gets yanked out of frame
ted is flopping around on the pavement and a fisherman has his foot on his face as he struggles to remove the hook
mary looks on concerned
ted and mary come out of the grocery store each holding a couple bags
ted also is carrying puffy in a bodycast
ted puts puffy on the roof then starts putting the groceries in the back seat
mary pulls her car up in front of her apartment
as ted gets out of the passengers side he notices that puffy is still on the roof
he quickly grabs puffy before mary notices
warren is futilely taking swings in a batting cage while mary looks on helplessly
finally ted goes into the cage signals the guy to stop the pitching machine and moves warren a little closer to the plate
a distraught ted sits somberly on a bench
beside him mary comforts warren whose left eye is black and blue and completely ted shows up at marys apartment door carrying a bouquet of flowers and a baseball
when he knocks the door opens
ted peeks around the corner and sees a somber mary sitting on the couch
mary doesnt look up
ted enters revealing his gifts
ted contd the flowers are for you and the balls for warren
i had a friend of mine fedex it to me its signed by tony conigliaro
mary finally looks up but doesnt smile
did you hire pat healy to follow me around
ted tries to hide his horror
lamely what do you mean
mary picks up a letter off the coffee table and hands it to him
ted takes a quick look and then drops it on the table
its not true
ted clears his throat
well funny story there
you see uh it started out as a uh
mary stands up
wait hold on mary its not as bad as it sounds
i certainly didnt know that you put a murderer on my trail
well yeah i didnt know much about him
i just thought what did you think ted
that you could spy on me and trick me into thinking you were someone i could
really go for
mary starts to get emotional
mary i swear i wasnt trying to trick you
then what the fuck did you do it for
i did it because because id never stopped thinking about you and if i didnt find you i knew my life would never be good again
mary looks away
softly please leave
devastated mary come on
and so ted does
ted comes out of the building a broken man
he paces back and forth on the sidewalk manic with despair
then he seems to grow angry
he rifles through his pockets until he finds a slip of the paper reads healys miami address court street apt
ted walks down a rather dark hallway until he comes to apartment
he knocks on the door but no one answers
he tries the handle and the door opens
ted enters and immediately reacts to the stench
reveals that the place is a fucking pig sty
dog shit is everywhere flies fill the room a mouse scampers across the carpet
suddenly he hears someone out in the hall so he ducks behind the door
healy and tucker enter the apartment and stop in their tracks when they see the mess
ho ly shit
hey this is a pretty nice place
what the fuck happened here
again no answer
suddenly ted slams the door shut and grabs healy by the collar
healy contd alarmed hey hey hey
hey buddy dont do anything rash now
to tucker who the fuck are you
hes in love with mary too
ted releases healy and glares at him
you fucked me man
why would you do that
righteous what do you mean why

i think everybody could use a drink
tucker goes into the kitchen
look you asked me to follow your girl around and i did and i started to like her and then i realized i just couldnt in good conscience do it
amazed do what
turn her over to a stalker
youre calling me a stalker
thats right if you werent you wouldve looked for her yourself
suddenly they hear a sound and turn to see bill the boa slithering into the room with a huge great dane size lump in his midsection
healy contd sickened oh christ
youre a sick man you know that
yeah well fuck you
you just cant stand the fact that it was my turn
getting emotional thats right hot shot

to healy right
well i was sick of it man
no more it was my turn
it was time for me

to be happy
this is so pathetic that it actually gets to ted
he sits down runs his fingers through his hair
well you didnt have to blow us both out of the water
jesus christ just because she found out about you whyd you have to take me down with you
i dont know what youre talking about
im talking about the letter asshole
ted stares at him
are you telling me you didnt send mary a letter outlining our deal
why the fuck would i do that

the guys stare at one another then tucker comes out the kitchen with a drink
they turn their attention to him
healy contd you little fuck

moves in on tucker you crossed the line man
tucker backs away nervously
whoa whoa youre getting crazy now

healy grabs tucker by the neck
tucker contd i swear
i didnt tell her nothing
you probably did it yourself you piece of shit
oh that makes a lot of sense
why would i rat myself out
like im going to try to figure out a guy whos idea of courting is blowing farts in the chicks face you were following us

how the hell you think i got rid of marys boyfriend steve
this gets teds attention
steve didnt say all that stuff about warren

goody two shoes
he was like a fucking eagle scout
you two should be kissing my balls if it wasnt for me she mightve married that schmuck
ted thinks about this
the hell with you both im out of here
ted walks out the door leaving healy and tucker to stare each other down
just then hal the great dane walks out of the bedroom with a cereal box stuck on his head
healy does a double take then looks back at the snake
look if it wasnt you who sent the letter and it wasnt me who sent it
an alarmed mary
what are what are you doing here
reveals dom sitting on her bed

dom contd give me a break mare i was nuts
mary backs into the living room
healy and tucker are parked right out front listening to this conversation

tucker just shrugs
mary and dom
im asking you to leave
gentle oh mary honey youre taking this all wrong

dom contd v

clearly struggling stop that

healy and tucker jump out of the car and run into the building
healy and tucker storm into the room and freeze at what they see
dom is cradling several pairs of shoes in his arms and trying to crawl to the door while mary holds him back
just one pair
you owe me that much you heartless bitch
healy and tucker grab dom and throw him down on the couch
dom youre pathetic fucking over your friend ted like that
you fucked him over too
hes no friend of mine
suddenly magda enters from her bedroom
shes holding a half eaten banana split
herb the homeless man follows after her sporting a tom jones and buttoning up his shirt
what the hells going on here
at first no one knows what to say
then were in love with your roommate
aw christ i cant take it anymore

magda heads back into her bedroom and herb follows
tucker where are your crutches
tucker is stumped for a second then british accent interesting query mary
healy slaps tucker in the back of the head
shut the fuck up and tell her the truth
before he can respond ted enters
well isnt this nice now weve got the whole gang together
ted can hardly believe dom is there

healy glares at tucker
you see i exaggerated a little there

pleased im just a pathological liar
mary looks at tucker confused

tucker lowers his head and reluctantly nods
i live up in pompano with my folks
just then the door opens and brett favre the packers quarterback enters with warren wearing a walkman beside him
everyone is stunned
mary contd brett

ted looks into marys eyes
she looks vulnerable

ted looks mary in the eye then starts for the door
ted contd as he passes warren see you warren
ted lifts the earphones off warrens ear
see you warren
ted then walks out of the room
they all stand there in silence for a moment then dom turns to brett favre
hey brett any chance i can get you to autograph one of these pumps for me
ted is walking down the street blubbering like a schoolgirl
everyone he passes stares at him
suddenly mary comes running down the other side of the street
ted stops and looks across the street at her
he wipes his eyes hopeful
what what are you doing here
you forgot your keys
she holds up a rabbit foot key chain
they remain across the street from one another
did you mean what you said back there ted
ted starts to well up again
mary contd ted
looking down i
i just want you to be happy mary
but i think id be happiest
ted just stares at her

ted contd wiping eyes but but what about steve
oh yeah thatd make golf real fun the guy doesnt even drink beer or gamble
now ted smiles
mary contd get over here
the beaming ted starts walking across the street
suddenly a bus whizzes by and smacks ted broadside
he bounces around under the bus like a rag doll then finally squirts out the back end and mary screams and runs toward the body as a crowd begins to
ted no no
she starts giving him cpr
somebody covers him with a blanket
just then another car whizzes over his feet like speedbumps
the crowd winces
mary contd somebody hold up traffic
beat come on ted
tell me youre going to be okay
then ted takes a deep breath and his eyes flutter open
oh mary i love you
marys smile is as bright as the light from heaven
i love you too ted
beat i think i always have
as the two lovebirds kiss a lady calls out over here
i found his foot
it was in the storm drain
as she holds up a severed foot in a cloth
all right everyone lets fan out and look for the penis
