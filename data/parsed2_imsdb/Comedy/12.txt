she pays attention to allens dream when he says the word invisible
the talk show host speaks flatly angrily

i see myself looking in a mirror
im having this dream almost every night
marie noel listens more carefully to the radio
view on a sparkling lake
view on marie noel throwing bouquet at her wedding

marie noel looks in the mirror again the conversation on the radio affirms something she knows to be true
and how long have you been having this dream
like an entire solid month
a truck wipes the frame and we see marie noel walking along the highway at a leisurely pace
then all of a sudden i see myself walking down a road by the harbor
the talk show host interrupts
we hear a telephone ring
and how do you feel at this point in the dream
tony having been stopped by the truck cuts down a side street to get around the gridlock
we hear allens phone ring

he tries to transfer incoming calls without losing them
he has the talk show host on hold again

marie noel walks toward camera as allen enters frame on the left
allen and marie noel pass at the corner

tony pulls into the frame at the intersection and marie noel sees tony who does not notice either allen or marie noel
marie noel runs to tonys convertible car and jumps in the back

brenda walks through the rain toward the doors of the concert
wawa guitar bursts from the inside through the unopened doors
brenda looks murderous in her wild hair and hot pants
tony and marie noel wander separately around the party as costumed hipsters sway with the music
two women react in horror as something unseen occurs which causes the crowd to panic
a sheep is left standing in the empty hall
tony and marie noel both scratch their ears at the same time
a faint sound of thunder causes tony to look into the distance
they interrupt each other again
you know at this point im blaming it all on bad karma
this is how we die man

as she approaches she suddenly stops
we hear the sound of rain
it is a clear morning
perplexed she laughs
tony and marie noel walk urgently through a wooded section of the park
the sound of thunder gets louder and louder getting closer to them
tony grabs marie noels arm as the fearful sound passes close to them without incident
brenda walks past the camera still perplexed by the odd occurrence
we see the mountain again and continue to hear the airplane
the fog is coming in
tops of buildings disappear

tony and marie noel walk along totally engulfed in fog
what if we get it for not warning her
we see a sheep standing beside a tree in the fog
through a fog we see a sheep standing next to a tree
