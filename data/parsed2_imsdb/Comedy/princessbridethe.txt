your vote of confidence is overwhelming
book open now be begins to read
the princess bride by s
buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of florin
the story hes reading about as the monochromatic look of the bedroom is replaced by the dazzling color of the english countryside
off screen her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there
his name was westley but she never called him that
to the kid isnt that a wonderful beginning
off screen doing his best yeah
its really good
off screen reading nothing gave buttercup as much pleasure as ordering westley around
buttercup is standing holding the reins of her horse while in the background westley in the stable doorway looks at her
buttercup is in her late teens doesnt care much about clothes and she hates brushing her long hair so she isnt as attractive as she might be but shes still
probably the most beautiful woman in the world
polish my horses saddle
i want to see my face shining in it by morning
quietly watching her as you wish
westley is perhaps half a dozen years older than buttercup
and maybe as handsome as she is beautiful
he gazes at her as she walks away
off screen as you wish was all he ever said to her
westley outside chopping wood
buttercup drops two large buckets near him
fill these with water a beat please
as you wish
she leaves his eyes stay on her
she stops turns he manages to look away as now her eyes stay on him
off screen that day she was amazed to discover that when he was saying as you wish what he meant was i love you
westley enters with an armload of firewood
off screen and even more amazing was the day she realized she truly loved him back
pointing to a pitcher that she could reach herself farm boy fetch me that pitcher
he gets it hands it to her they are standing very close to each other gazing into each others eyes
as you wish
now he turns moves outside
westley and buttercup outside his tiny hovel in the red glow of sunset
they are locked in a passionate kiss
off screen hold it hold it what is this
are you trying to trick me
wheres the sports
is this a kissing book
wait just wait well when does it get good
keep your shirt on
let me read
reading again westley had no money for marriage
so he packed his few belongings and left the farm to seek his fortune across the sea
they stand near the gate to the farm locked in an embrace
off screen reading it was a very emotional time for buttercup off screen groaning i dont be leeve this
i fear ill never see you again
of course you will
but what if something happens to you
hear this now i will come for you
but how can you be sure
this is true love
you think this happens every day
he smiles at her she smiles too throws her arms so tightly around him
then as westley walks away buttercup watches him go
off screen reading westley didnt reach his destination
his ship was attacked by the dread pirate roberts who never left captives alive
when buttercup got the news that westley was murdered off screen perking up a little murdered by pirates is good close up buttercup staring out the window of her room
off screen she went into her room and shut the door
and for days she neither slept nor ate
no emotion at all in her voice i will never love again
hold on her face perfect and perfectly sad
the main courtyard of florin replete with townspeople livestock and a bustling marketplace
off screen reading five years later the main square of florin city was filled as never before to hear the announcement of the great prince humperdincks bride to be
prince humperdinck a man of incredible power and bearing standing in his royal robes on a castle balcony
three others standing behind him an old couple with crowns the aging king and queen and a dark bearded man who seems the princes match in strength this is count
raises his hands starts to speak my people
a month from now our country will have its th anniversary
on that sundown i shall marry a lady who was once a commoner like yourselves pause but perhaps you will not find her common now
would you like to meet her
and the answering yessss booms like summer thunder
a giant staircase leading to the crowd and as a figure just begins to become visible the crowd as they see the figure
we havent yet
and if there is such a thing as collective action then this crowd collectively holds its breath
the staircase as the figure appears in the archway
it is buttercup
and she resplendent
the princess buttercup
she descends the stairs and starts to move amongst the people
the crowd and they do a very strange thing with no instruction at all they suddenly go to their knees
great waves of people kneeling and buttercup terribly moved
she stands immobile among her subjects blinking back tears
hold on her beauty for a moment
off screen buttercups emptiness consumed her
although the law of the land gave humperdinck the right to choose his bride she did not love him
and buttercup barreling along controlling her horse easily
off screen despite humperdincks reassurance that she would grow to love him the only joy she found was in her daily ride
lovely quiet deserted
buttercup suddenly reins in
a word my lady
three men standing close together in the path
beyond them can be seen the waters of florin channel
the three men are not your everyday commuter types
standing in front is a tiny man with the most angelic face
he is sicilian and his name is vizzini
beside him is a spaniard erect and taut as a blade of steel
his name is inigo montoya
beside him is a giant
his name is fezzik
we are but poor lost circus performers
is there a village nearby
there is nothing nearby not for miles
then there will be no one to hear you scream he nods to the giant fezzik who merely reaches over touches a nerve on buttercups neck and the start of
a scream is all she manages unconsciousness comes that fast
as she starts to fall a sailboat is moored
its dusk now shadows are long
inigo the spaniard busies himself getting the boat ready
the giant fezzik carries buttercup unconscious on board
vizzini rips some tiny pieces of fabric from an army jacket and tucks them along the saddle of buttercups horse
there is about the entire operation a sense of tremendous skill and precision
what is that youre ripping
not stopping or turning its fabric from the uniform of an army officer of guilder
pointing straight out the country across the sea
the sworn enemy of florin
slaps the horses rump go
the horse takes off
they start for the boat
once the horse reaches the castle the fabric will make the prince suspect the guilderians have abducted his love
when he finds her body dead on the guilder frontier his suspicions will be totally confirmed
you never said anything about killing anyone
vizzini hops onto the boat
ive hired you to help me start a war
thats a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition
i just dont think its right killing an innocent girl
whirling on fezzik am i going mad or did the word think escape your lips
you were not hired for your brains you hippopotamic land mass
i agree with fezzik
close up vizzini in a fury
we only thought he was in a fury now hes really getting mad oh
the sot has spoken
what happens to her is not truly your concern i will kill her louder and remember this never forget this inigo and fezzik as vizzini advances on them
nothing shows on inigos face but fezzik is panicked by vizzini
to inigo when i found you you were so slobbering drunk you couldnt buy brandy now to fezzik who retreats as much as he can while vizzini advances and you
friendless brainless helpless hopeless do you want me to send you back to where you were unemployed in greenland
vizzini glares at him then turns leaves them
during this inigo has gone close to fezzik who is very distressed at the insults hes just received
as inigo casts off
softly that vizzini he can fuss
a slight emphasis on the last word looking at inigo fuss
suddenly hes got it again emphasis on the last word
i think he likes to scream at us
probably he means no harm
hes really very short on charm
proudly oh youve a great gift for rhyme
yes some of the time
he starts to smile whirling on them enough of that
as they sail off we hear their voices as the boat recedes
fezzik are there rocks ahead
if there are well all be dead
no more rhymes now i mean it
anybody want a peanut
as vizzini screams we inigo is at the helm fezzik stands near the body of the princess whose eyelids flutter slightly or do they
vizzini sits motionless
the waves are higher there are only occasional flashes of moon slanting down between clouds
to inigo well reach the cliffs by dawn
inigo nods glances back
why are you doing that
making sure nobodys following us
that would be inconceivable
despite what you think you will be caught
and when you are the prince will see you all hanged
vizzini turns a cold eye on the princess
of all the necks on this boat highness the one you should be worrying about is your own
inigo keeps staring behind them
stop doing that
we can all relax its almost over youre sure nobodys following us
as i told you it would be absolutely totally and in all other ways inconceivable
no one in guilder knows what weve done
and no one in florin could have gotten here so fast
out of curiosity why do you ask
its only i just happened to look behind us and something is there
and suddenly the three whirl stare back and as they do its hard to see the moon is behind clouds now
but the wind whistles
and the waves pound
and suddenly its all gone ominous
inigo fezzik and vizzini squinting back trying desperately to see
at this moment they are all holding their breaths
and theres still nothing to be seen
its still ominous
only now its eerie too
then the moon slips through and inigo was right something is very much there
with a great billowing sail
its a good distance behind them but its coming like hell closing the gap
staring at the other boat
explaining with as much logic as he can muster probably some local fisherman out for a pleasure cruise at night through eel infested waters
and now as a sound comes from their boat they turn as we buttercup diving into the water starting to swim away
and vizzini screaming
go in get after her
i dont swim
to the unasked question i only dog paddle
still close to the boat switching from a crawl to a silent breast stroke
the wind dies and as it does something new is heard
a not too distant high pitched shrieking sound
buttercup stops suddenly treads water
do you know what that sound is highness
those are the shrieking eels if you doubt me just wait
they always grow louder when theyre about to feed on human flesh
buttercup treading water still not far from the boat
the shrieking sounds are getting louder and more terrifying
buttercup stays silent
if you swim back now i promise no harm will come to you
i doubt you will get such an offer from the eels
buttercup and shes a gutsy girl
the shrieking sound is louder still but she doesnt make a sound
behind her now something dark and gigantic slithers past
shes scared sure petrified who wouldnt be but she makes no reply and now a shrieking eel has zeroed in on her
and now she sees it a short distance away circling starting to close and buttercup is frozen trying not to make a movement of any kind and the eel slithers
closer closer and buttercup knows it now theres nothing she can do its over all over and now the eel opens its mouth wide and its never made such a noise and as its great jaws are about to clamp down off screen she doesnt get eaten by the eels at this time
and the second we hear him the kid looks the same pale and weak but maybe hes gripping the sheets a little too tightly with his hands
the eel doesnt get her
im explaining to you because you looked nervous
well i wasnt nervous
his grandfather says nothing just waits
well maybe i was a little bit concerned
but thats not the same thing
because i can stop now if you want
you could read a little bit more
if you want
he grips the sheets again as the grandfather picks up the book
reading do you know what that sound is highness
were back in the boat
those are the shrieking eels
off screen were past that grandpa
you read it already
oh my goodness i did
beg your pardon
off screen all right all right lets see
uh she was in the water the eel was coming after her
she was frightened
the eel started to charge her
and then and were back where we were at the last moment we saw her buttercup frozen the shrieking eel jaws wide about to clamp down as we
pounding the eel unconscious in one move then easily lifting buttercup
the boat and fezzik buttercup being deposited on the deck
put her down
just put her down
pointing behind them
i think hes getting closer
vizzini tying buttercups hands
hes no concern of ours
to buttercup i suppose you think youre brave dont you
staring deep at him only compared to some
the boat at dawn being followed closely by the black sailboat which we can see for the first time is being sailed by a man in black and his boat
almost seems to be flying
hes right on top of us
i wonder if he is using the same wind we are using
whoever he is hes too late pointing ahead of them see
big the cliffs of insanity
and once hes said the name they rise straight up sheer from the water impossibly high
in a wild race for the cliffs and the man in black is closing faster than ever but not fast enough the lead was too great to overcome and as
inigo sails with great precision straight at the cliffs being pursued
move the thing
that other thing
staring back now were safe only fezzik is strong enough to go up our way hell have to sail around for hours til he finds a harbor
there is much activity going on all of it swift expert economical
fezzik reaches up along the cliff face grabs a jutting rock reaches behind it
suddenly there is a thick rope in his hands
he drops back to the boat gives the rope a freeing swing and the rope goes all the way to the top
hurrying to fezzik
he straps a harness to him then lifts buttercup and vizzini in the harness
finally he himself gets in the harness
all three are strapped to fezzik like papooses
and he starts to ascend the rope carrying them all along with him as he goes
the man in black sailing in toward the cliffs of insanity watching as fezzik rises swiftly through the first moments of dawn
fezziks group is only faintly visible far below
this is the first time weve gotten the real vertigo feeling and its a gasper
fezzik climbing on
buttercup is almost out of her mind with fear
fezzik is moving right along however high they are hes already over a third of the way done
leaping from his ship to the rope starting to climb
hes impossibly far behind but the way he goes youd think he didnt know that because he is flying up the rope hand over hand like lightning
looking down hes climbing the rope
and hes gaining on us
he prods fezzik who nods increases his pace
roaring up the rope and and the man in black is cutting deeply into fezziks lead
i thought i was going faster
you were supposed to be this colossus
you were this great legendary thing
and yet he gains
well im carrying three people
and hes got only himself
cutting through i do not accept excuses
shaking his head im just going to have to find myself a new giant thats all
hurt dont say that vizzini
and his arms begin moving much more slowly
his arms still work as before
if anything he has speeded up
fezziks lead is smaller and smaller
maybe a hundred feet for fezzik to go
vizzini and the others and its getting too close now
did i make it clear that your job is at stake
less than a hundred feet behind them
vizzini leaps off and takes out a knife begins to cut the rope which is tied around a great rock while inigo helps the princess to her feet and fezzik
just stands around waiting for someone to tell him to do something
nearby are some stone ruins
once they might have been a fort now the kind of resemble stonehenge
feet from the top now maybe less maybe only and his pace is as dazzling as before and cutting through the last of the rope and slithering across the ground
and out of sight toward the channel like some great serpent at last going home
standing with inigo and buttercup by the cliff edge
to inigo impressed he has very good arms
hanging suspended hundreds of feet in the air holding to the jagged rocks desperately trying to cling to life
stunned turning to the others looking down
he didnt fall
whirling on vizzini you keep using that word i do not think it means what you think it means
looks down again my god
and so he is
very slowly he is picking his way upwards sometimes a foot at a time sometimes an inch
the group at the top staring down
whoever he is hes obviously seen us with the princess and must therefore die
to fezzik you carry her
to inigo well head straight for the guilder frontier
catch up when hes dead
if he falls fine
if not the sword
i want to duel him left handed
you know what a hurry were in
well its the only way i can be satisfied
if i use my right tch over too quickly
turns abruptly starts off screen oh have it your way
still creeping his way upward
who goes to inigo
you be careful
gravely people in masks cannot be trusted
calling out im waiting
fezzik nods hurries after vizzini
he watches them depart then turns peers down over the cliffs
he watches a moment then paces shaking his hands loose
he practices a few of his honed fencing skills
he is a taut and nervous fellow and has never been one for waiting around
he must be six inches closer to the top than when last we saw him
inigo is watching
finally he goes back to cliff edge starts to talk
its instant death if the man in black falls but neither gives that possibility much credence
this is our two heroes meeting
they dont know it yet but thats what it is
hollering down hello there
the man in black glances up kind of grunts
look i dont mean to be rude but this is not as easy as it looks
so id appreciate it if you wouldnt distract me
inigo steps away draws his sword loosens up with a few perfect thrusts
then resheathes and looks eagerly over the edge again
i do not suppose you could speed things up
with some beat if youre in such a hurry you could lower a rope or a tree branch or find something useful to do
i could do that
in fact ive got some rope up here
but i do not think that you will accept my help since i am only waiting around to kill you
that does put a damper on our relationship
he finds another bold a few inches higher
but i promise i will not kill you until you reach the top
thats very comforting
but im afraid youll just have to wait
i hate waiting
i could give you my word as a spaniard
ive known too many spaniards
and he just hangs there in space resting gathering his strength
you dont know any way youll trust me
nothing comes to mind
and on these words camera zooms into a close up on inigo
he raises his right hand high his eyes blaze and his voice takes on a tone we have not heard before
i swear on the soul of my father domingo montoya you will reach the top alive
there is a pause
throw me the rope
he dashes to the giant rock the rope was originally tied to
as his grip loosens a moment trying to cling to the side of the cliff
now with a small coil of rope hurries back to the edge and hurls it over it hangs close to the man in black
he releases the rocks grabs the rope hangs helplessly in space a moment then looks up at inigo and straining forcing his body away from the cliff edge and rising
through the early morning light slowly steadily and as the cliff top at last comes within reach watching as the man in black crawls to safety then looks to inigo
pulling his sword thank you
well wait until youre ready
the man in black sits to rest on the boulder that once held the rope
he tugs off his leather boots and is amazed to see several large rocks tumble out
the man in black wears gloves
inigo stares at them
i do not mean to pry but you dont by any chance happen to have six fingers on your right hand
he glances up the question clearly baffles him
do you always begin conversations this way
my father was slaughtered by a sixfingered man
he was a great swordmaker my father
and when the six fingered man appeared and requested a special sword my father took the job
he slaved a year before he was done
he hands his sword to the man in black
fondling it impressed i have never seen its equal
even now this still brings pain
the six fingered man returned and demanded it but at one tenth his promised price
my father refused
without a word the six fingered man slashed him through the heart
i loved my father so naturally challenged his murderer to a duel i failed
the six fingered man did leave me alive with the six fingered sword but he gave me these
he touches his scars
looking up at inigo
how old were you
i was eleven years old
when i was strong enough i dedicated my life to the study of fencing
so the next time we meet i will not fail
i will go up to the sixfingered man and say hello my name is inigo montoya
you killed my father
prepare to die
youve done nothing but study swordplay
more pursuit than study lately
you see i cannot find him
its been twenty years now
i am starting to lose confidence
i just work for vizzini to pay the bills
theres not a lot of money in revenge
handing back the great sword starting to rise well i certainly hope you find him someday
you are ready then
whether i am or not youve been more than fair
you seem a decent fellow
i hate to kill you
walking away a few paces unsheathing his sword you seem a decent fellow
i hate to die
and on that word and what we are starting now is one of the two greatest sword fights in modern movies the other one happens later on and right from
the beginning it looks different
because they arent close to each other none of the swordscrossing en garde garbage
no what we have here is two men two athletes and they look to be too faraway to damage each other but each time one makes even the tiniest feint
the other counters and there is silence and as they start to circle feinting here feinting there and finished teasing begin to duel in earnest
their swords cross then again again and the sound comes so fast its almost continual
inigo presses on the man in black retreating up a rocky incline
thrilled youre using bonettis defense against me ah
i thought it fitting considering the rocky terrain naturally you must expect me to attack with capo ferro
and he shifts his style now
coping as best he can naturally suddenly shifting again but i find thibault cancels out capo ferro dont you
the man in black is now perched at the edge of the elevated castle ruin
no where to go he jumps to the sand
inigo stares down at him
unless the enemy has studied his agrippa and now with the grace of an olympian inigo flies off the perch somersaults clean over the man in blacks head and lands
facing his opponent
which i have
the two men are almost flying across the rocky terrain never losing balance never coming close to stumbling the battle rages with incredible finesse first one and then the other
gaining the advantage and by now its clear that this isnt just two athletes going at it its a lot more that that
this is two legendary swashbucklers and theyre in their prime its burt lancaster in the crimson pirate battling errol flynn in robin hood and then incredibly the action begins going
even faster than before as we and behind him now drawing closer all the time is the deadly edge of the cliffs of insanity
inigo fights and ducks and feints and slashes and it all works but not for long as gradually the man in black keeps the advantage keeps forcing inigo back closer
and closer to death
happy as a clam you are wonderful
thank you ive worked hard to become so
the cliff edge is very close now
inigo is continually being forced toward it
i admit it you are better than i am
then why are you smiling
inches from defeat inigo is in fact all smiles
because i know something you dont know
and what is that
i am not left handed
and he throws the six fingered sword into his right hand and immediately the tide of battle turns
stunned doing everything be can to keep inigo by the cliff edge
but no use
slowly at first he begins to retreat
now faster inigo is in control and the man in black is desperate
and the six fingered sword is all but invisible now as he increases his attack then suddenly switches styles again
a rocky staircase leading to a turret shaped plateau and the man in black is retreating like mad up the steps and he cant stop inigo nothing can stop inigo
and in a frenzy the man in black makes every feint tries every thrust lets go with all he has left
but he fails
he tries one or two final desperate moves but they are nothing
i ought to be after twenty years
and now the man in black is smashed into a stone pillar pinned there under the six fingered sword
hollering it out theres something i ought to tell you
i am not left handed either
and now he changes hands and at last the battle is fully joined
and to his amazement he is being forced back down the steps
he tries one style another but it all comes down to the same thing the man in black seems to be in control
and before inigo knows it the six fingered sword is knocked clear out of his hand
inigo retreats dives from the stairs to a moss covered bar suspended over the archway
he swings out lands and scrambles to his sword and we who watches inigo then casually tosses his sword to the landing where it sticks in perfectly
then the man in black copies inigo
not copies exactly improves
he dives to the bar swings completely over it like a circus performer and dismounts with a backflip
staring in awe
who are you
no one of consequence
i must know
get used to disappointment
moving like lightning and he thrusts forward slashes darts back all in almost a single movement and dodging blocking and again he thrusts forward faster even than before and again
he slashes but and there is never a move anyone makes he doesnt remember and this time he blocks the slash slashes out himself with the sixfingered sword
on it goes back and forth across the rocky terrain inigos feet moving with the grace and speed of a great improvisational dancer
as it is knocked free arching up into the air and catching it again
and something terrible is written behind his eyes he has given his all done everything man can do tried every style made every maneuver but it wasnt enough and on
his face for all to see is the realization that he inigo montoya of spain is going to lose
moving in for the end now blocking everything muzzling everything and sent flying from inigos grip
he stands helpless only a moment
then be drops to his knees bows his head shuts his eyes
kill me quickly
i would as soon destroy a stained glass window as an artist like yourself
however since i cant have you following me either and he dunks inigos head with his heavy sword handle
inigo pitches forward unconscious
please understand i hold you in the highest respect
he grabs his scabbard and takes off after the princess and we inconceivable
vizzini staring down from a narrow mountain path as far below the man in black can be seen running
fezzik carrying the princess stands alongside
its a little later in the morning
give her to me
grabs buttercup starts off catch up with us quickly
starting to panic what do i do
finish him finish him
oh good my way
thank you vizzini
little pause which way is my way
vizzini points to them
there is a large boulder nearby
pick up one of those rocks get behind the boulder and in a few minutes the man in black will come running around the bend
the minute his head is in view hit it with the rock
as vizzini and buttercup hurry away
little frown softly my ways not very sportsmanlike
he grabs one of the rocks and plods behind the boulder and we
racing up the mountain trail
ahead is a bend in the trail
he sees it slows
then he stops listening
satisfied by the silence he starts forward again and as he rounds the bend a rock flies into frame shattering on a boulder inches in front of him
he moves into the mountain path
he has picked up another rock and holds it lightly
i did that on purpose
i dont have to miss
i believe you so what happens now
we face each other as god intended
no tricks no weapons skill against skill alone
you mean youll put down your rock and ill put down my sword and well try to kill each other like civilized people
gently i could kill you now
he gets set to throw but the man in black shakes his head takes off his sword and scabbard begins the approach toward the giant
frankly i think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting
its not my fault being the biggest and the strongest
i dont even exercise
he flips the rock away
the man in black is not now and has never been a shrimp
but its like he wasnt even there fezzik towers over him so much
there is a moments pause and then the man in black dives at fezziks chest slams him several tremendous blows in the stomach twists his arm severely slips skillfully into
a beautifully applied bear hug and in general makes any number of terrific wrestling moves
fezzik just stands there kind of taking in the scenery
finally the man in black pushes himself away stares up at the giant
look are you just fiddling around with me or what
i just want you to feel youre doing well
i hate for people to die embarrassed
they get set to begin again
then suddenly as he jumps forward with stunning speed for anyone his size and reaches for the man in black who drops to his knees spins loose and slips between
the giants legs
and a good thing too
getting set for another onslaught why do you wear a mask
were you burned by acid or something like that
its just that theyre terribly comfortable
i think everyone will be wearing them in the future
fezzik considers this a moment then attacks and if he moved quickly last time this time he is blinding and as the man in black slips down to avoid the
charge fezzik moves right with him only instead of twisting free and jumping to his feet this time the man in black jumps for fezziks back and in a moment he is riding him and his arms have fezziks throat locked across fezziks windpipe one in front one behind
the man in black begins to squeeze
standing talking as he does so i just figured out why you give me so much trouble
as he charges toward a huge rock that lines the path and just as he reaches it he spins his giant body so that the entire weight of the charge
is taken by the man in black
and the power of the charge is terrible the pain enormous but he clings to his grip at fezziks windpipe
his arms never leave fezziks throat why is that do you think
his voice just beginning to get a little strained well i havent fought just one person for so long
ive been specializing in groups
battling gangs for local charities that kind of thing
again fezzik charges slower this time but still a charge and again he spins and creams the man in black against the rough boulder
and the punishment is terrible and for a moment it seems as if he is going to let go of fezziks windpipe and crumble but he doesnt he holds on
why should that make such a difference
and now his voice is definitely growing weaker you see you use different moves when youre fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about
again fezzik slams the man in black against a boulder only this time his power has diminished and fezzik starts to slowly collapse
and there isnt much breath coming
holding his grip as fezzik tries to stand halfway makes it but there is no air
back to his knees he falls holds there for a moment and pitches down to all fours
the man in black increases the pressure
fezzik tries to crawl
but there is just no air
fezzik goes to earth and lies still
as the man in black turns him over puts his ear to fezziks heart
the man in black stands
i dont envy you the headache you will have when you awake
but in the meantime rest well
and dream of large women
and he nimbly scoops up his sword with his foot catches it and as he dashes off up along the mountain path as he slips his boot into a foot
print in the sand
count rugen mounted watches
behind him half a dozen armed warriors also mounted
a great white horse waits riderless in front
humperdinck is all over the rocky ground and maybe he isnt the best hunter in the world
then again maybe he is
because as he begins to put his feet into strange positions we realize that what he is doing is miming the fencers
there was a mighty duel it ranged all over
they were both masters
how did it end
looking down in the position where inigo fell unconscious the loser ran off alone
points in the direction vizzini and fezzik took the winner followed those footprints toward guilder
shall we track them both
the loser is nothing
only the princess matters to the armed warriors clearly this was all planned by warriors of guilder
we must be ready for whatever lies ahead
could this be a trap
vaulting onto his horse i always think everything could be a trap which is why im still alive
and he gallops off cresting the peak of the mountain
a knife pointed at a throat pull back to reveal vizzini munching on an apple holding the knife to buttercups throat
she is blindfolded
a picnic spread is laid out
a tablecloth two goblets and between them a small leather wine container
and some cheese and a couple of apples
the picnic is set on a lovely spot high on the edge of a mountain path with a view all the way back to the sea
the man in black comes running around the path sees vizzini slows
the two men study each other
then so it is down to you
and it is down to me
the man in black nods and comes nearer if you wish her dead by all means keep moving forward
and he pushes his long knife harder against buttercups unprotected throat
let me explain theres nothing to explain
youre trying to kidnap what ive rightfully stolen
perhaps an arrangement can be reached
there will be no arrangement deliberate and youre killing her
as vizzini jabs with his long knife
buttercup gasps against the pain
but if there can be no arrangement then we are at an impasse
im afraid so i cant compete with you physically
and youre no match for my brains
youre that smart
let me put it this way have you ever heard of plato aristotle socrates
in that case i challenge you to a battle of wits
for the princess
the man in black nods
to the death
then pour the wine
as vizzini fills the goblets with the dark red liquid the man in black pulls a small packet from his clothing handing it to vizzini
inhale this but do not touch
doing it i smell nothing
taking the packet back what you do not smell is called iocane powder
it is odorless tasteless dissolves instantly in liquid and is among the more deadlier poisons known to man
watching excitedly as the man in black takes the goblets turns his back
a moment later he turns again faces vizzini drops the iocane packet
it is now empty
the man in black rotates the goblets in a little shell game maneuver then puts one glass in front of vizzini the other in front of himself
all right where is the poison
the battle of wits has begun
it ends when you decide and we both drink and find out who is right and who is dead
but its so simple
all i have to do is divine from what i know of you
are you the sort of man who would put the poison into his own goblet or his enemys
he studies the man in black now
now a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given
im not a great fool so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of you
but you must have known i was not a great fool you would have counted on it so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of me
and now theres a trace of nervousness beginning youve made your decision then not remotely
because iocane comes from australia as everyone knows
and australia is entirely peopled with criminals
and criminals are used to having people not trust them as you are not trusted by me
so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of you
truly you have a dizzying intellect
wait till i get going
where was i
yes australia and you must have suspected i would have known the powders origin so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of me
very nervous youre just stalling now
cackling youd like to think that wouldnt you
stares at the man in black youve beaten my giant which means youre exceptionally strong
so you could have put the poison in your own goblet trusting on your strength to save you
so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of you
but youve also bested my spaniard which means you must have studied
and in studying you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible so i can clearly not choose
the wine in front of me
as vizzinis pleasure has been growing throughout the man in blacks has been fast disappearing
youre trying to trick me into giving away something it wont work triumphant it has worked youve given everything away i know where the poison is
fools courage then make your choice
and i choose and suddenly he stops points at something behind the man in black
what in the world can that be
turning around looking
i dont see anything
busily switching the goblets while the man in black has his head turned
oh well i i could have sworn i saw something
the man in black turns to face him again
vizzini starts to laugh
whats so funny
ill tell you in a minute
first lets drink me from my glass and you from yours
and he picks up his goblet
the man in black picks up the one in front of him
as they both start to drink vizzini hesitates a moment
then allowing the man in black to drink first he swallows his wine
you guessed wrong
roaring with laughter you only think i guessed wrong louder now thats whats so funny
i switched glasses when your back was turned
theres nothing he can say
he just sits there
you fell victim to one of the classic blunders
the most famous is never get involved in a land war in asia
but only slightly less well known is this never go in against a sicilian when death is on the line
he laughs and roars and cackles and whoops and is in all ways quite cheery until he falls over dead
stepping past the corpse taking the blindfold and bindings off buttercup who notices vizzini lying dead
the man in black pulls her to her feet
who are you
i am no one to be trifled with that is all you ever need know
he starts to lead her off the mountain path into untraveled terrain
a final glance back toward vizzini to think all that time it was your cup that was poisoned
they were both poisoned
i spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder
and with that he takes off dragging her behind him
its where fezzik fought the man in black
camera pulls back to reveal the prince kneeling inspecting every grain of misplaced sand
the others wait behind him
someone has beaten a giant
roaring there will be great suffering in guilder if she dies
he leaps onto his horse and they charge off
the man in black comes running into view still dragging buttercup who sometimes stumbles but he keeps forcing her along
finally when she is close to exhaustion he lets go of her
his voice harsh now carrying the promise of violence catch your breath
if youll release me
whatever you ask for ransom
youll get it i promise you
and what is that worth the promise of a woman
youre very funny highness
i was giving you a chance
no matter where you take me
theres no greater hunter than prince humperdinck
he could track a falcon on a cloudy day
he can find you you think your dearest love will save you
i never said he was my dearest love
and yes he will save me
that i know
you admit to me you do not love your fiance
he knows i do not love him
are not capable of love is what you mean
i have loved more deeply than a killer like yourself could ever dream
and the man in black cocks back a fist
buttercup flinches but does not retreat
that was a warning highness
the next time my hand flies on its own
for where i come from there are penalties when a woman lies
the picnic is spread as before
camera pulls back to reveal the prince kneeling by the body as the others ride up
the prince grabs the empty poison packet hands it to rugen after first sniffing it himself
id bet my life on it
gestures to the trail ahead and there are the princesss footprints
she is alive
or was an hour ago
if she is otherwise when i find her i shall be very put out
and as he vaults onto his horse and the all charge off
being spun into camera view falling heavily as the man in black releases her
we are at the edge of an almost sheer ravine
the drop is sharp and severe
below the ravine floor is flat but getting there would not be half the fun
stares at him i know who you are your cruelty reveals everything
the man in black says nothing
youre the dread pirate roberts admit it
bowing with pride
what can i do for you
you can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces
hardly complimentary your highness
why loose your venom on me
close up buttercup quietly now
you killed my love
watching her closely
its possible i kill a lot of people
who was this love of yours
another prince like this one ugly rich and scabby
a farm boy
poor and perfect with eyes like the sea after a storm
and probably if she did not hate roberts so there would be tears
on the high seas your ship attacked and the dread pirate roberts never takes prisoners
explaining as a teacher might i cant afford to make exceptions
once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft people begin to disobey you and then its nothing but work work work all the time
you mock my pain
life is pain highness
anyone who says differently is selling something
i remember this farm boy of yours i think
this would be what five years ago
does it bother you to hear
nothing you can say will upset me
he died well that should please you
no bribe attempts or blubbering
he simply said please
please i need to live
it was the please that caught my memory
i asked him what was so important for him
true love he replied
and then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness
i can only assume he meant you
you should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are
and what am i
faithfulness he talked of madam
your enduring faithfulness
now tell me truly
when you found out he was gone did you get engaged to your prince that same hour or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead
you mocked me once never do it again i died that day
the man in black is about to reply as they stand there on the edge of the sheer ravine
but then something catches his attention and as he stares at it briefly the dust cloud caused by humperdincks horses is rising up into the sky
and while his attention is on the dust cloud rising high she pushes him with all the strength she has
you can die too for all i care
teetering on the ravine edge for a moment then he begins to fall
down goes the man in black
down down rolling spinning crashing always down toward the flat rock floor of the ravine
staring transfixed at what she has wrought
there is a long pause
she stands there alone as from far below the words come to her drifting on the wind as
oh my sweet westley what have i done
and without a second thought or consideration of the dangers she starts into the ravine
a moment later she too is falling spinning and twisting crashing and torn cartwheeling down toward what is left of her beloved
prince humperdinck and the others reining in at the spot where buttercup promised ransom in exchange for her freedom
the prince shakes his head
he must have seen us closing in which might account for his panicking in error
unless im wrong and i am never wrong they are headed dead into the fire swamp
the mere mention of the fire swamp makes him pale
two bodies lie a few feet apart not moving
it is of course buttercup and westley
they might be corpses
after a time westley slowly forces his body into motion and as he does bruised and torn as westley crawls slowly toward her
can you move at all
weakly stretching out an arm toward him move
if you want i can fly
i told you i would always come for you
why didnt you wait for me
you were dead
death cannot stop true love
all it can do is delay it for a while
i will never doubt again
there will never be a need
and now they begin to kiss its a tender kiss tender and loving and gentle and off screen oh no
what is it
whats the matter
theyre kissing again do we have to hear the kissing part
someday you may not mind so much
skip on to the fire swamp that sounded good
youre sick ill humor you
he picks up the book again so now where were we here
yeah yeah yeah
westley and buttercup raced along the ravine floor
racing along the ravine floor
westley glances up
perched on top of the cliff looking down at westley and buttercup
your pig fiance is too late
a few more steps and well be safe in the fire swamp
and westley has tried to say it with chevalier like nonchalance but she aint buying
well never survive
nonsense youre only saying that because no one ever has
as they race off leaving humperdinck and his men stranded defeated
and it really doesnt look any worse than any other moist sulphurous infernal horror you might run across
great trees block the sun
buttercup is clearly panicked and maybe westley is too but he moves jauntily along sword in hand
its not that bad
im not saying id like to build a summer home here but the trees are actually quite lovely
the giant trees thick and black green look ominous as hell and they shield all but intermittent stripes of sun
a giant spurt of flame leaps up preceded by a slight popping sound and this particular spurt of flame misses westley but buttercup is suddenly onfire at least the lower
half of her is and instantly forcing buttercup to sit gathering her flaming hem in his hands doing his best to suffocate the fire
this isnt all that easy and it causes him a bit of grief but he does his best to sound as jaunty as before
well now that was an adventure
he examines where the flames burst over her
singed a bit were you
she wasnt and she shakes her head no you
he was and he shakes his head no
as he pulls her to her feet and as theres another popping sound pulling her aside to safety as another great spun of flame suddenly shoots up
well one thing i will say
the fire swamp certainly does keep you on your toes
buttercup is frozen with fear
he takes her hand gently leads her forward as we moving slowly along through a particularly dangerous part of the fire swamp
its later now the sun slants down at a slightly different angle
happily this will all soon be but a happy memory because roberts ship revenge is anchored at the far end
and i as you know am roberts
but how is that possible since hes been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago
i myself am often surprised at lifes little quirks
there is again a popping sound then a huge spurt of flame
westley simply picks up buttercup as they walk along moves her out of danger puts her back down goes right on talking without missing a beat
you see what i told you before about saying please was true
it intrigued roberts as did my descriptions of your beauty
they look like they could be flesh eating
westley takes his sword slices a path for them to follow
the vines groan as they fall
hes been chatting away the entire time
finally roberts decided something
he said all right westley ive never had a valet
you can try it for tonight
ill most likely kill you in the morning
three years he said that
good night westley
ill most likely kill you in the morning
it was a fine time for me
i was learning to fence to fight anything anyone would teach me
and roberts and i eventually became friends
and then it happened
go on westley picks her up carrying her across some swamp water that is bridged by a narrow rickety tree branch
well roberts had grown so rich he wanted to retire
so he took me to his cabin and told me his secret
i am not the dread pirate roberts he said
my name is ryan
i inherited this ship from the previous dread pirate roberts just as you will inherit it from me
the man i inherited it from was not the real dread pirate roberts either
his name was cummerbund
the real roberts has been retired fifteen years and living like a king in patagonia
then he explained the name was the important thing for inspiring the necessary fear
you see no one would surrender to the dread pirate westley
the two of them have by now crossed the pond
so we sailed ashore took on an entirely new crew and he stayed aboard for awhile as first mate all the time calling me roberts
once the crew believed he left the ship and i have been roberts ever since
except now that were together i shall retire and hand the name over to someone else
is everything clear to you
buttercup perplexed is about to reply but the ground she steps on gives way its lightning sand a great patch of it and it has her a cloud of powder
rises and she sinks into the stuff crying westleys name but then she is gone as we slashing at a u shaped vine hacks it in half its still connected to the tree
then be grabs it drops his sword and clutching the other end of the vine he dives into the lightning sand and there is another cloud of white powder but
it settles quickly
now nothing can be seen
nothing at all
just the lightning sand lovely and lethal
an odd panting sound is heard now
the panting sound is suddenly very loud
and then a giant r
darts into view
a rodent of unusual size is probably no more than eighty pounds of bone and power
it sniffs around a bit then as quickly as it has come it goes
as westley lungs long past the bursting point explodes out he has buttercup across his shoulders and as he pulls to the edge of the lightning sand pit using the
vine her face is caked with the white powder
it is in her eyes her ears hair mouth
shes still probably beautiful but you have to look awfully hard to see it
as westley continues to pull them to safety high above them it watches placed against a tree
westley is cleaning the lightning sand from her face
he hesitates glances around and on a much lower branch now
it stares down at westley
westley stares back up at the beast
buttercup is oblivious
her eyes flutter
he continues to work on her as well never succeed we may as well die here
we have already succeeded
he glances back again
now there are two r
the have climbed into a nearby tree stare hungrily down
westley picking her up
he puts an arm around her starts to walk with her as he encouragingly goes on talking
i mean what are the three terrors of the fire swamp
one the flame spurts
theres a popping sound preceding each we can avoid that
two the lightning sand
but you were clever enough to discover what that looks like so in the future we can avoid that too
westley what about the r
rodents of unusual size
i dont think they exist
and as he says that a r
comes flying at him from offscreen
screaming and westley pinned under the attacking r
trying to fend it off
the things teeth sink deep into his arm
westley drives a fist into the beasts face rolling it off
he reaches for his sword just a few feet away but the r
is back atop him
its a fierce battle and just when we think westley cant possibly win he flips the ugly rodent clear
westley scrambles for his sword
stampedes on changing its target heading right for buttercup and shes scared to death and westley
westley abandons his sword reaching for the rodent grabbing only a tail wrestling with it
buttercup grabs a small branch and using it as a club beats the skull of the thing doing pretty well but the beast manages to snag her hem with its
razor teeth and shes pulled to the ground and
jumping onto its back and the r
is all over him now sinking needle teeth into westleys shoulder
with death close at hand as a popping sound starts
he tries one desperate move rolls into the sound shooting skyward and with the r
pinned under him and as the beast bursts into flame it lets go and westley rolls safely free grabs his sword and exhaustedly stabs the r
which is trying to put itself out
westley stands motionless exhausted
the danger has passed
beyond a beach
almost in disbelief we did it
now was that so terrible
and from somewhere they summon strength pick up their pace and as they reach the edge of the fire swamp humperdinck on his horse rugen beside him
three warriors armed and ready are mounted in formation behind
buttercup and westley are at the edge of the fire swamp about to leave it
buttercup looks beyond exhaustion
westley looks worse
behind humperdinck are the waters of the bay
staring out at the others
you mean you wish to surrender to me
very well i accept
i give you full marks for bravery dont make yourself a fool
ah but how will you capture us
we know the secrets of the fire swamp
we can live there quite happily for some time
so whenever you feel like dying feel free to visit
i tell you once again surrender
it will not happen
looking from one to the other then something else catches her eye and we
in shadow with a loaded crossbow aimed at westleys heart
looking the other way crossbow aimed at westley
roaring for the last time surrender
roaring right back bigger frantically staring around and now crossbow stretched ready to shoot this one is hidden in a tree blocking any escape westley might try
will you promise not to hurt him
whirling to face her
what was that
whirling to face her
what was that
talking to them both
if we surrender and i return with you will you promise not to hurt this man
may i live a thousand years and never hunt again
looks at westley he is a sailor on the pirate ship revenge
promise to return him to his ship
i swear it will be done
staring deep into each others eyes
whispering once were out of sight take him back to florin and throw him in the pit of despair
almost a smile i swear it will be done
i thought you were dead once and it almost destroyed me
i could not bear it if you died again not when i could save you
westley is dazed
buttercup tries to speak again cant and is swooped off her feet onto humperdincks horse and off they go
staring after her
rugen watches as his warriors bring westley to him
the count has a heavy sword and he holds it in his hand
we must get you to your ship
we are men of action
lies do not become us
well spoken sir westley is looking at him
what is it
you have six fingers on your right hand someone was looking for you count rugen clubs westley hard across the skull
westley starts to fall the screen goes black
dank and chill underground and windowless lit by flickering torches
westley lies in the center of the cage chained and helpless
dead pale he silently enters the pit carrying a tray of food and medication
he puts it down
where am i
he only whispers the pit of despair
he begins tending westleys wounds
garbled dont even think a hack sputter cough now his voice seems normal again dont even think about trying to escape
the chains are far too thick
and dont dream of being rescued either
the only way in is secret
and only the prince the count and i know how to get in and out
then im here till i die
working away till they kill you
then why bother curing me
the prince and the count always insist on everyone being healthy before theyre broken
so its to be torture
the albino nods
i can cope with torture
the albino shakes his head
you dont believe me
you survived the fire swamp
you must be very brave
little pause but nobody withstands the machine
he studies westley whose face is almost sad
and her face is sad
pallid perhaps ill
she wanders down a corridor in florin castle
as she moves unseeing past an intersecting corridor watching her
shes been like that ever since the fire swamp
looks at rugen its my fathers failing health thats upsetting her
unbelieving of course
as they move on camera holds on it while we hear the grandfathers voice reading
off screen the king died that very night and before the following dawn buttercup and humperdinck were married
and if we thought it was packed before we didnt know how many more could fit in this courtyard
humperdinck rugen and the queen stand high on the balcony
off screen and at noon she met her subjects again
this time as their queen
my fathers final words were
off screen hold it
hold it grandpa
and the scene freezes humperdinck caught in mid sentence
the kid is half sitting now not strong yet but clearly stronger than when we first saw him
you read that wrong
she doesnt marry humperdinck she marries westley
im just sure of it
after all that westley did for her if she does not marry him it wouldnt be fair
well who says life is fair
where is that written
life isnt always fair
im telling you youre messing up the story now get it right
do you want me to go on with this
all right then
no more interruptions
starts to read again at noon she met her subjects again
this time as their queen
and on these words
my fathers final words were love her as i loved her and there will be joy
i present to you your queen
and on his words and its gigantic
we saw before as buttercup emerges
suddenly going to its knees wave after wave of silent kneeling people
all of them down
touched as before but then she seems stunned as we someone is booing
the booing gets louder as an ancient woman approaches buttercup through the crowd booing every step of the way
why do you do this
because you had love in your hands and you gave it up
distraught but they would have killed westley if i hadnt done it
your true love lives and you marry another to the crowd true love saved her in the fire swamp and she treated it like garbage
and thats what she is the queen of refuse
so bow down to her if you want
bow to her
bow to the queen of slime the queen of filth the queen of putrescence
she advances on buttercup now who is more and more panicked
louder and louder and louder she shrieks vituperation at buttercup reaching out her old hands toward buttercups throat and buttercup is as frightened now as dorothy was when the witch
went after her in the wizard of oz and suddenly coming out of her nightmare alone in her castle bedroom
as she frantically grabs a robe and starts to run
off screen still reading it was ten days till the wedding
the king still lived but buttercups nightmares were growing steadily worse
off screen see
didnt i tell you shed never marry that rotten humperdinck
off screen yes youre very smart
bursting into the princes chambers
count rugen stands nearby
it comes to this i love westley
i always have
i know now i always will
if you tell me i must marry you in ten days please believe i will be dead by morning
finally softly he begins to talk
i could never cause you grief consider our wedding off
to rugen you returned this westley to his ship
then we will simply alert him
to buttercup now beloved are you certain he still wants you
after all it was you who did the leaving in the fire swamp
not to mention that pirates are not known to be men of their words
my westley will always come for me
i suggest a deal
you write four copies of a letter
ill send my four fastest ships
one in each direction
the dread pirate roberts is always close to florin this time of year
well run up the white flag and deliver your message
if westley wants you bless you both
please consider me as an alternative to suicide
are we agreed
and she nods
the trees are unusual in one respect all of them are extraordinarily heavily knotted
humperdinck and rugen walking into the grove of trees
your princess is really a winning creature
a trifle simple perhaps but her appeal is undeniable
oh i know
the people are quite taken with her
its odd but when i hired vizzini to have her murdered on our engagement day i thought that was clever
but its going to be so much more moving when i strangle her on our wedding night
once guilder is blamed the nation will be truly outraged
theyll demand we go to war
they are deeper into the grove now
rugen is searching around
now where is that secret knot
its impossible to find
finding the knot on the tree he hits it and it opens revealing a staircase leading underground
are you coming down into the pit
westleys got his strength back
i am starting him on the machine tonight
tyrone you know how much i love watching you work
but ive got my countrys five hundredth anniversary to plan my wedding to arrange my wife to murder and guilder to frame for it
get some rest if you havent got your health you havent got anything
rugen smiles and hurries down the stairs as the tree slides back perfectly into place
we cant tell quite what it is or what it does but somehow it is unsettling
count rugen dragging westley up alongside the thing levers and wheels and wires you name it its there
beautiful isnt it
the albino starts attaching suction cups to westley
it took me half a lifetime to invent it
im sure youve discovered my deep and abiding interest in pain
at present im writing the definitive work on the subject
so i want you to be totally honest with me on how the machine makes you feel
with numbers ranging from a low of to a high of
rugen goes to it
this being our first try ill use the lowest setting
and he turns the dial to
he has suction cups on his head now on his temple on his heart his hands and feet
he says nothing keeps control of himself fiddling with his machine a moment more
and then he opens the flood gate water pours down the chute turning the wheel which in turn really gets the machine going
and hes lying on the table and hes only flesh and the chains are metal and thick but such is his desperation it almost seems he might break them
a terrible sound comes from his throat an incessant gasping
it keeps on coming as we finally he switches off the machine picks up a large notebook and pen sits in a chair
the noise of the machine subsides
rugen opens the book to a blank page
as you know the concept of the suction pump is centuries old
well really thats all this is
except that instead of sucking water im sucking life
ive just sucked one year of your life away
i might one day go as high as five but i really dont know what that would do to you
so lets just start with what we have
what did this do to you
and remember this is for posterity so be honest how do you feel
in anguish so deep it is dizzying
helpless he cries
count rugen watches the tears then starts to write
in his quarters swamped
piles of papers are strewn all over
now yellin a pale shifty quick eyed man appears in the doorway
bows then kneels sire
as chief enforcer of all florin i trust you with this secret killers from guilder are infiltrating the thieves forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night
my spy network has heard no such news
any word from westley
turning to her in the doorway
too soon my angel
he will come for me
as she glides out she will not be murdered
on the day of the wedding i want the thieves forest emptied and every inhabitant arrested
many of the thieves will resist
my regular enforcers will be inadequate
form a brute squad then
i want the thieves forest emptied before i wed
it wont be easy sire
alone exhausted try ruling the world sometime
a lot of hollering is going on
the thieves are being rounded up by the brute squad a large group of large men
yellin stands on a wagon in the midst of all the scuffling
off screen the day of the wedding arrived
the brute squad had their hands full carrying out humperdincks orders
to an unpleasantlooking assistant is everybody out
theres a spaniard giving us some trouble
well you give him some trouble
and his wagon starts and as it does drunk as a skunk sprawled in front of a hovel a bottle of brandy in one hand the six fingered sword in
he looks dreadful
unshaven puffy eyed gaunt
but the way he brandishes the great sword in front of him would give anyone cause for worry
i am waiting for you vizzini
you told me to go back to the beginning
so i have
this is where i am and this is where ill stay
i will not be moved
he takes a long pull from his brandy bottle
he stops as the assistant brute comes into view
i do not budge
keep your ho there
he waves his sword dangerously
but the prince gave orders so did vizzini when a job went wrong you went back to the beginning
and this is where we got the job
so its the beginning and im staying till vizzini comes
gesturing off screen you
i am waiting for vizzini
off screen you surely are a meanie
inigo feels a hand on his back
a huge hand
he compares it to his own smaller hand
and as the assistant brute is just about to club inigos brains out fezzik lets fly with a stupendous punch
the assistant brute takes the full force of the blow right in the chops
its like he was shot from a cannon as he careens backwards out of sight across the street
there is a pause
then a crunching sound as he clearly has come in contact with something hard and immobile
fezzik puts inigo down
you dont look so good
after inigo blasts air in protest you dont smell so good either
i feel fine
and so fezzik puts inigo down
thats when inigo faints and as he does inigo sits slumped in a chair while fezzik spoons him some stew
off screen fezzik and inigo were reunited
and as fezzik nursed his inebriated friend back to health he told inigo of vizzinis death and the existence of count rugen the sixfingered man
considering inigos lifelong search he handled the news surprisingly well
and he faints again into his stew
one filled with steaming water the other with water clearly of an icy nature
without a word fezzik stuffs inigos head into the icy water then after a reasonable amount of time pulls him out ducks him into the steaming stuff and a short
time after that puts him back in the cold again then back in the hot off screen fezzik took great care in reviving inigo
up and going thats enough
where is this rugen so i may kill him
hes with the prince in the castle
but the castle gate is guarded by thirty men
how many could you handle
i dont think more than ten
doing the math on his fingers that leaves twenty for me
at my best i could never defeat that many
he sinks sadly down i need vizzini to plan
i have no gift for strategy
but vizzinis dead
silent and bereft
then a wild look hits inigo
no not vizzini i need the man in black what
look he bested you with strength your greatness
he bested me with steel
he must have outthought vizzini and a man who can do that can plan my castles onslaught any day
lets go where
to find the man in black obviously
but you dont know where he is
he is possessed by demons now dont bother me with trifles after twenty years at last my fathers soul will be at peace
big there will be blood tonight
strewn with maps etc
yellin enters and kneels
sharpening his dagger rise and report
the thieves forest is emptied
thirty men guard the castle gate
my princess must be safe
the gate has but one key and i carry that
he shows the key dangling from a chain around his neck
just at that moment buttercup enters
my dulcet darling
tonight we marry
tomorrow morning your men will escort us to florin channel where every ship in my armada waits to accompany us on our honeymoon
every ship but your four fastest you mean
the prince looks at her blankly for a moment
every ship but the four you sent
yes of course
naturally not those four
bows exits your majesties
staring at humperdinck
you never sent the ships
dont bother lying
it doesnt matter
westley will come for me anyway
sharply youre a silly girl
yes i am a silly girl for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear
close to erupting speaks very distinctly i would not say such things if iwere you why not
you cant hurt me
westley and i are joined by the bonds of love
and you cannot track that
not with a thousand bloodhounds
and you cannot break it
not with a thousand swords
and when i say you are a coward that is only because you are the slimiest weakling ever to crawl the earth
jumping at her yanking her by the hair starting to pull her along out of control his words indistinct
as the prince throws open the door to buttercups room slams it shut locks it breaks into a wild run and
but its not on
count rugen is adding more notes to his book
he looks up as the prince suddenly comes down the steps raging
at westley you truly love each other and so you might have been truly happy
not one couple in a century has that chance no matter what the storybooks say
and so i think no man in a century will suffer as greatly as you will
and with that he whirls turns on the machine grabs the lever and calling out not to fifty
but its too late as we shoving the lever all the way up and and there has never been such pain
the pain grows and grows and with it now something else has started the death scream
as the death scream starts to rise as the sound moves along louder and louder and
and they bear it and a few of the brutes turn to each other in fear and as the scream builds and she hears the sound doesnt know what it
is but her arms involuntarily go around her body to try to control the trembling and the scream still builds and there are many people it is the day of the countrys th anniversary but all the people stop as the sound hits them
a few children pale bolt toward their parents and trying to make their way through the jammed marketplace which suddenly quiets as the fading sound comes through
instantly fezzik fezzik listen do you hear
that is the sound of ultimate suffering
my heart made that sound when rugen slaughtered my father
the man in black makes it now
the man in black
his true love is marrying another tonight so who else has cause for ultimate suffering
trying to push through excuse me its too crowded
pardon me its important no one budges and the sound is fading faster
fezzik please gigantic and roaring everybody
and the crowd begins to fall away and he and inigo start to track the fading sound
the albino appears wheeling a barrow
inigos sword pushes at his chest
where is the man in black
the albino shakes his head says nothing
you get there from this grove yes
fezzik jog his memory
and fezzik crunches the albino on the top of the head as if he had a hammer and was driving in a nail
the albino drops without a sound
upset im sorry inigo
i didnt mean to jog him so hard
he kneels the sword held tight between his hands
eyes closed he faces the grove of trees starts to talk his voice low and strange
father i have failed you for twenty years
now our misery can end
somewhere close by is a man who can help us
i cannot find him alone
i need you
i need you to guide my sword
and now he rises eyes still closed
guide my sword
as inigo eyes shut tight walks forward the great sword held in his hands
fezzik frightened follows close behind
that reveals the staircase
walking blind through the grove of trees
he moves to the secret knot hesitates then moves past it
then inigo stops
for a long moment he stands frozen
suddenly he whirls eyes still closed and the sword strikes home dead center into a knot and nothing
he has failed
in utter despair he collapses against the tree
against a knot in the tree
against the knot in the tree
it slides away revealing the staircase
fezzik and inigo look at each other then start down
dead by the machine
fezzik leans over him listening for a heartbeat
then he looks at inigo shakes his head
inigo is in despair
for a moment he just sags
barely able to speak it just is not fair
off screen grandpa grandpa wait he is terribly excited and looks stronger than weve yet seen him
wait what did fezzik mean hes dead
i mean he didnt mean dead
the grandfather says nothing just sits there
westleys only faking right
you want me to read this or not
who gets humperdinck
i dont understand
who kills prince humperdinck
at the end somebodys got to do it
is it inigo
nobody kills him
you mean he wins
what did you read me this thing for
and he desperately fights for control
you know youve been very sick and youre taking this story very seriously
i think we better stop now
he closes the book and starts to get up
shaking his head no
gestures toward the chair sit down
sitting and opening the book again all right now lets see
where were we
in the pit of despair
were back in the pit the same shot as before
for a moment he just sags
well we montoyas have never taken defeat easily
come along fezzik
bring the body
not stopping have you any money
i have a little
i just hope its enough to buy a miracle thats all
as fezzik takes the corpse follows inigo up the stairs inigo fezzik westley approach the door
from inside the hovel a little mans voice is heard
if mel brooks year old man was really old hed resemble this guy
off screen go away
inigo pounds again
opening a small window in the door what
are you the miracle max who worked for the king all those years
the kings stinking son fired me
and thank you so much for bringing up such a painful subject
while youre at it why dont you give me a nice paper cut and pour lemon juice on it
he shuts the window
they rap on the door
opening the window beat it or ill call the brute squad
im on the brute squad
looking at the giant you are the brute squad
we need a miracle
its very important
look im retired
and besides why would you want someone the kings stinking son fired
i might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle
hes already dead
for the first time interested he is eh
ill take a look
bring him in
he unlocks the door and lets them in
fezzik carries westley who is just starting to stiffen up a little
he lays westley down across a bench by the fireplace picks westleys arm up and lets it drop limp
ive seen worse
he studies westley a moment checking here checking there
were really in a terrible rush
he takes nothing from nobody dont rush me sonny
you rush a miracle man you get rotten miracles
you got money
i never worked for so little except once and that was a very noble cause
this is noble sir
pointing to westley remorseful his wife is crippled
his children are on the brink of starvation
are you a rotten liar
i need him to help avenge my father murdered these twenty years
your first story was better
looking around wheres that bellows
spots it he probably owes you money huh
well ill ask him
he goes to get a huge bellows
stupefied hes dead
he cant talk
look who knows so much
well it just so happens that your friend here is only mostly dead
theres a big difference between mostly dead and all dead
please open his mouth
max inserts the bellows in westleys mouth and starts to pump
now mostly dead is slightly alive
now all dead
well with all dead theres usually only one thing that you can do
he stops pumping
go through his clothes and look for loose change
he starts pumping again
to westley hey
hello in there
whats so important
what you got here thats worth living for
and he presses lightly on westleys chest
everybody stares at westley lying there on the bench
you heard him
you could not ask for a more noble cause than that
sonny true love is the greatest thing in the world
except for a nice mlt a mutton lettuce and tomato sandwich where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe
theyre so perky i love that
but thats not what he said
he distinctly said to blave
and as we all know to blave means to bluff
so youre probably playing cards and he cheated liar liar li a a ar valerie an ancient fury storms out of a back room and toward get back witch im
not a witch im your wife
but after what you just said im not even sure i want to be that anymore
you never had it so good
he said true love max
my god retreating dont say another word valerie
turning to inigo and fezzik hes afraid
ever since prince humperdinck fired him his confidence is shattered
whyd you say that name you promised me that you would never say that name pursuing him now what humperdinck
ooo ooo humperdinck holding his hands over his ears im not listening
a life expiring and you dont have the decency to say why you wont help nobodys hearing nothing
but this is buttercups true love if you heal him he will stop humperdincks wedding
humperdinck to valerie shut up now to inigo wait
i make him better humperdinck suffers
that is a noble cause
give me the sixty five im on the job
and as valerie shrieks excitedly we it is somewhat smaller than a tennis ball
pull back to reveal max and valerie exhausted looking at the lump with beautific pleasure as valerie cooking utensil in hand covers the thing with what looks like chocolate
inigo and fezzik stare at the thing too but more dubiously
a little appalled thats a miracle pill
finishing the chocolate coating makes it go down easier
but you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency
and you shouldnt go swimming after for at least what
yeah an hour
a good hour
inigo accepts the pill as fezzik takes westley who is stiff as a board now
heading out the door fezzik close behind thank you for everything
waving after them bye bye boys
have fun storming the castle
to max think itll work
it would take a miracle
and as they wave trying to look happy we on the top of the outer wall of the castle
they look down to the front gate of the castle
the sixty brutes are visible
fezzik is thunderstruck by how many brutes there are
upset he turns to inigo who is concentrating unsuccessfully trying to prop westley against the wall
inigo theres more than thirty absolutely unfazed whats the difference
indicating the half dead westley weve got him
help me here
well have to force feed him
has it been fifteen minutes
we cant wait the weddings in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand
during this fezzik using all his strength has managed to get westley into a right angled sitting position while inigo brings out the miracle pill
tilt his head back
open his mouth
following orders how long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works
pill in hand he drops it into westleys mouth
your guess is as good as mine frantic ill beat you both apart
ill take you both together
guess not very long
inigo and fezzik react
westley is the only one not amazed
why wont my arms move
he sits there immobile like a ventriloquists dummy
youve been mostly dead all day
we had miracle max make a pill to bring you back
who are you
are we enemies
why am i on this wall
let me explain pauses very briefly no there is too much
let me sum up
buttercup is marrying humperdinck in a little less than half an hour so all we have to do is get in break up the wedding steal the princess make our
escape after i kill count rugen
that doesnt leave much time for dilly dallying
he is watching his fingers one of which twitches now
youve just wiggled your finger
ive always been a quick healer
to inigo what are our liabilities
there is but one working castle gate
fezzik helps inigo raise westley just high enough so he can see for himself
and it is guarded by sixty men
and our assets
your brains fezziks strength my steel
if i had a month to plan maybe i could come up with something
he shakes his head from side to side
trying to be cheery you just shook your head that doesnt make you happy
my brains his steel and your strength against sixty men and you think a little head jiggle is supposed to make me happy
i mean if we only had a wheelbarrow that would be something
where did we put that wheelbarrow the albino had
over the albino i think
well why didnt you list that among our assets in the first place
what i wouldnt give for a holocaust cloak
there we cannot help you
pulling one out will this do
to fezzik surprised where did you get that
at miracle maxs
it fit so nice he said i could keep it
all right all right
come on help me up
inigo and fezzik do
now ill need a sword eventually
you cant even lift one
true but thats hardly common knowledge is it
and his bead tilts limply back
fezzik sets it up right for him thank you
now there may be problems once were inside
ill say how do i find the count
once i do how do i find you again
once i find you again how do we escape
sharply dont pester him hes had a hard day
nods right right sorry
they move along the wall in silence for a time
then these words come to us on the wind inigo
i hope we win
in her bridal gown and shes incredible
its not just her beauty theres a tranquillity about her now
the prince fastening a pearl necklace around her
you dont seem excited my little muffin
should i be
brides often are im told
gently confidently i do not marry tonight
and she couldnt seem more serene
my westley will save me
looking down on the gate with inigo and fezzik
and yellin standing there flanked by his sixty brutes
looking out at the enemy
this is it
inigo and fezzik shake hands
westley cant even do that but after a bit of rocking back and forth he manages to get enough momentum to catapult his arm over and onto his friends
the most intelligent looking the most impressive appearing clergyman imaginable
buttercup and humperdinck kneel before the clergyman
behind them sit the mumbling old king and queen
standing in the back is count rugen
four guards are in position flanking the chapel door
clears his throat begins to speak mawidge
mawidge is what bwings us togewer today
he has an impediment that would stop a clock
mawidge the bwessed awwangement that dweam wiffim a dweam
and now from outside the castle there begins to come a commotion
and then off screen stand your ground men
stand your ground
by the gate for it is indeed they who are making the commotion frightened pointing
stand your ground
and it is a bit unnerving a giant seems to be floating toward them out of the darkness a giant in a strange cloak and with a voice that would
deep and booming
and he seems to be floating because hes standing in the wheelbarrow as inigo hidden behind him busts a gut by pushing it and supporting westley
keeping the brutes in position or trying to shouting orders instructions and as yet the brutes hold
now inigo struggles bravely under their combined weight now
as the giant bursts suddenly happily into flames
roaring the chapel where the impressive clergyman plows on
ven wuv twoo wuv wiw fowwow you fowever
prince humperdinck turning quickly giving a sharp nod to count rugen who immediately takes off out of the chapel with the four guards as we fezzik flaming and scary as
as suddenly the brutes just scream and take off in wild panic stay where you are
i said stay where you are
so tweasuwe your vruv
skip to the end
have you the wing
as humperdinck whips out the ring the screams are very loud outside
here comes my westley now
fezzik as he pulls off the holocaust cloak
fezzik the portcullis
and fezzik rushes forward grabbing the portcullis which is indeed closing quickly
fezzik grabs the gate and swings the tonnage back upward
yellin just watches in fear
as humperdinck shoves the ring on buttercups finger your westley is dead
buttercup only smiles shakes her head
i killed him myself
never more serene then why is there fear behind your eyes
and shes right
pressed against the main gate
westley inigo and fezzik close in
give us the gate key
every ounce of honesty hes got i have no gate key
fezzik tear his arms off
steps toward him
oh you mean this gate key
and he whips it out hands it to fezzik
and do you pwincess buwwercwup
man and wife say man and wife
man and wife
whirling to the king and queen escort the bride to the honeymoon suite ill be there shortly
and as he dashes off standing there
he didnt come
racing through the castle and as they reach a complex intersection of several corridors rugen stops incredulous as we moving toward them
actually fezzik is dragging westley who is in turn dragging yellins sword like a stiff dog leash westley simply hasnt the strength to raise it
as the confrontation is about to start
kill the dark one and the giant but leave the third for questioning
and as his warriors attack inigo goes wild and maybe the warriors are good maybe theyre even better than that but they never get a chance to show it because
this is something now this is inigo gone mad and the six fingered sword has never flashed faster and the fourth warrior is dead before the first one has even hit the floor
there is a pause
then to rugen evenly and soft hello
my name is inigo montoya
you killed my father
prepare to die
for a moment he just stands there sword in hand
then he does a most unexpected thing
he turns and runs the hell away
momentarily surprised then taking off after him leaving westley and fezzik to exchange curious looks and rugen running through a half open heavy wooden door shutting it and locking it
just as inigo throws himself against it
he tries again
no kind of chance
calling out fezzik i need you who is still unable to walk under his own power
he calls back
indicating westley i cant leave him alone
desperately pounding at the heavy door
hes getting away from me fezzik
to westley ill be right back
and he props westley up against a large suit of armor and takes off toward the intersection where inigos voice came from still hammering the door
fezzik approaches gestures for him to stop and with one mighty swipe of his mighty hands the door crumbles thank you and inigo flies through as fezzik heads back to
the queen more sprightly is several paces ahead
can hardly be understood strange wedding
a very strange wedding
buttercup gently stops the king and places a kiss on his forehead
hes very surprised and pleased
what was that for
because youve always been so kind to me
and i wont be seeing you again since im killing myself once we reach the honeymoon suite
smiling away his hearing isnt what it once was wont that be nice
calling out to the queen she kissed me
and on those words and hes running dashing through corridors and as he glances back behind him coming like a streak and with the large suit of armor and fezzik
gaping staring at all those choices trying to piece together the puzzle of the missing westley
flashing out of one room down a staircase picking up his pace
he pulls out a deadly looking dagger with a sharp point and a triangular shaped blade and sprints on and
closing the gap closer closer and hes down the stairs and heading into a dining hall and throwing the dagger trying like hell to get out of the way but
no and it sticks deep into his stomach and he hurtles back helplessly against the wall of the room his eyes glazed blood coming from his wound
the room is going white on him
looking across the room at inigo
he stares at inigos face and then touches his own cheeks as memory comes
you must be that little spanish brat i taught a lesson to all those years ago
its simply incredible
have you been chasing me your whole life only to fail now
i think thats the worst thing i ever heard
shutting the door of the honeymoon suite crossing quietly to the far wall where she sits at a table opens a jeweled box and takes out a very deadly looking
she seems very much at peace as she touches the knife to her bosom
theres a shortage of perfect breasts in this world
it would be a pity to damage yours
and buttercup whirls as we lying on the bed
yellins sword is beside him
his voice sounds just fine but he does not move
buttercup leaps to the bed covering him with kisses
westley is helpless
oh westley darling
more kisses westley why wont you hold me
at a time like this thats all you can think to say
not so gently gently
and she lets go thumping his head against the headboard and looking very much surprised
are you still trying to win
inigo struggling feebly pulling the dagger from his stomach
holding the wound with his left hand
rugen is pushing off from the table sword in hand moving in to kill inigo
youve got an overdeveloped sense of vengeance
its going to get you into trouble some day
inigo watches the count approach and the count flicks his sword at inigos heart and theres not much inigo can do just kind of vaguely parry the thrust with the
six fingered sword and count rugens blade sinks deeply into inigos left shoulder
inigo doesnt seem to feel it his other agonies are so much worse
stepping back going for the heart again
and as this blow comes hes trying to use the wall for support in forcing himself to his feet and its not a roaring success of an attempt but he
does at least make some progress and again he manages to parry the thrust as this time rugens sword runs through his right arm
again inigo doesnt seem to mind doesnt even feel it
stepping back forj ust a moment watching as inigo continues to inch his way to his feet and then just before the count is about to strike again inigo manages
a little flick of his own and rugen hadnt expected it and he jumps back makes a little involuntary cry of surprise and slowly pushing away from the wall
all but audible hello
my name is inigo montoya you killed my father prepare to die
suddenly going into a fierce attack striking with great power and precision for he is a master swordsman and he forces inigo easily back drives him easily into the wall
but he does not penetrate inigos defense
none of the counts blows get home
as the count steps back a moment pushing slowly off from the wall again
a little louder hello
my name is inigo montoya you killed my father prepare to die
and again he attacks slashing with wondrous skill
but none of his blows get through and slowly inigo again moves forward
a little louder still hello
my name is inigo montoya
you killed my father
prepare to die
stop saying that
retreating more quickly around the table
inigo drives for the counts left shoulder now thrusts home where the count had gotten him
then another move and his blade enters the counts right shoulder the same spot inigo was wounded
all hes got
no offer me money and now the six fingered sword strikes and there is a slash bleeding along one of rugens cheeks
yes power too promise me that the great sword flashes again and now there is a parallel slash bleeding on rugens other cheek
all that i have and more please offer me everything i ask for anything you want roaring and on that and almost too fast for the eye to follow the
sword strikes one final time and crying out in fear and panic as the sword hits home dead center and
the sword clear through the count
they are almost frozen like that for a moment
then inigo withdraws his sword and as the count pitches down lying dead
his skin is ashen and the blood still pours from the parallel cuts on his cheeks and his eyes are bulging wide full of fear
staring at rugen
and now inigo does something we have never seen him do before he smiles
hold for just a moment on inigo smiling then westley lies as before not a muscle has moved his head is still on the headboard yellins sword at his side
buttercup is alongside the bed her eyes never leave his face
oh westley will you ever forgive me
what hideous sin have you committed lately
i got married
i didnt want to
it all happened so fast
it never happened
it never happened
but it did
i was there
this old man said man and wife
did you say i do
well no we sort of skipped that part
then youre not married if you didnt say it you didnt do it a pause wouldnt you agree your highness
entering the room staring at them
he pulls out his sword
a technicality that will shortly be remedied
but first things first
to the death
a little pause to the pain
about to charge stops short i dont think im quite familiar with that phrase
and ill use small words so that youll be sure to understand you wart hog faced buffoon
that may be the first time in my life a man has dared insult me
lying there comfortably his words quiet at first
it wont be the last
to the pain means the first thing you lose will be your feet below the ankles then your hands at the wrists next your nose
gripping his sword watching
and then my tongue i suppose
i killed you too quickly the last time a mistake i dont mean to duplicate tonight
i wasnt finished the next thing you lose will be your left eye followed by your right takes step forward and then my ears i understand
lets get on with it wrong
your ears you keep and ill tell you why and now he stops and the look that was in his eyes at the wedding that look of fear is starting
so that every shriek of every child at seeing your hideousness will be yours to cherish every babe that weeps at your approach every woman who cries out dear god
what is that thing
will echo in your perfect ears
that is what to the pain means
it means i leave you in anguish wallowing in freakish misery forever
doing his best to hide the fear that keeps building inside him
i think youre bluffing lying there staring at him
its possible pig i might be bluffing its conceivable you miserable vomitous mass that im only lying here because i lack the strength to stand then again perhaps i have
the strength after all
and now slowly westley begins to move
his body turns his feet go to the floor he starts to stand staring eyes wide
and now he is standing sword in fighting position
slow and determined
and hes so panicked he doesnt know whether to pee or wind his watch
he throws his sword to the floor
to humperdinck have a seat
speaking to buttercup as humperdinck sits
tie him up
make it as tight as you like
and as she sets to work entering looking around
i thought he was with you
in that case his balance betrays him
to buttercup help him
why does westley need helping
because he has no strength
and now be starts wrestling mightily with his bonds
i knew it
i knew you were bluffing
i knew he was bluffing
staring at the prince shall i dispatch him for you
considers this then thank you but no whatever happens to us i want him to live a long life alone with his cowardice
off screen inigo
inigo where are you
they look at each other then move to the balcony and leading four great white horses
he glances up sees them on the balcony
ah there you are
inigo i saw the princes stables and there they were four white horses
and i thought there are four of us if we ever find the lad hello lad so i took them with me in case we ever bumped into each other
considers things a moment i guess we just did
looking down at fezzik
fezzik you did something right
dont worry i wont let it go to my head
and as he holds out his great arms buttercup floating through the air
whats happening of course is that shes jumping from the balcony so fezzik can catch her
but her fall is in slow motion so you might think she was flying
westley and inigo watching as fezzik catches buttercup
you know its very strange i have been in the revenge business so long now that its over i dont know what to do with the rest of my life
as inigo gets him ready for his jump have you ever considered piracy
youd make a wonderful dread pirate roberts
now from that triumphantly racing through the night and at last their trials are done
off screen they rode to freedom
and as dawn arose westley and buttercup knew they were safe
a wave of love swept over them
and as they reached for each other
as buttercup and westley begin their ultimate kiss the grandfather stops reading
no its kissing again
you dont want to hear it
i dont mind so much
he gestures for his grandfather to read
locked in a deep pure and passionate kiss
off screen since the invention of the kiss there have been five kisses that were rated the most passionate the most pure
this one left them all behind
the grandfather snaps the book closed
now i think you ought to go to sleep
standing readying to leave okay
the old man stops turns
maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow
a beat as you wish
and his smile is enough
