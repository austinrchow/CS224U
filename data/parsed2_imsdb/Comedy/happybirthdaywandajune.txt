b if window
href b b by kurt vonnegut silence
animal eyes begin to glow in the darkness
sounds of the jungle climax in animals fighting
a singer is heard singing the first bars of all gods chillun got shoes
harold looseleaf penelope and woodly stand in a row in the darkness facing the audience
they are motionless
a city skyline in the early evening materializes outside the windows
the lights come up on the living room of a rich mans apartment which is densely furnished with trophies of hunts and wars
there is a front door a door to the master bedroom suite and a corridor leading to other bedrooms the kitchen and so on
how do you do
my name is penelope ryan
this is a simple minded play about men who enjoy killing and those who dont
i am harold ryan her husband
i have killed perhaps two hundred men in wars of various sorts as a professional soldier
i have killed thousands of other animals as well for sport
i am dr
norbert woodly a physician a healer
i find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society
gentleness must replace violence everywhere or we are doomed
to looseleaf would you like to say something about killing colonel
embarrassed jesus i dunno
what the heck
colonel harper retired now dropped an atom bomb on nagasaki during the second world war killing seventy four thousand people in a flash
i dunno boy
you dont know
it was a bitch
to all you can leave now
to the audience making a peace sign peace
all but penelope exit
to the audience this is a tragedy
when its done my face will be as white as the snows of kilimanjaro
hyena laughs my husband who kills so much has been missing for eight years
he disappeared in a light plane over the amazon rain forest where he hoped to find diamonds as big as cantaloupes
his pilot was colonel looseleaf harper who dropped the bomb on nagasaki
hyena laughs i should explain the doorbells in this apartment
they were built by abercrombie and fitch
they are actual recordings of animal cries
the back doorbell is a hyena which youve just heard
the front doorbell is a lions roar
to the wings would you let them hear it please
lion roars thank you
paul her twelve year old son enters from corridor a sensitive neatly dressed little rich boys
and this is my son paul
he was only four years old when his father disappeared
radiantly sappily hes coming back mom
hes the bravest most wonderful man who ever lived
to audience i told you this was a simple minded play
maybe hell come back tonight
its his birthday
stay home tonight
ruefully for they have been over this before oh paul youre married
youve already got a husband
hes a ghost
not even mutual of omaha thinks so anymore
if you have to go out with some guy cant he be more like dad
sick herb shuttle and norbert woodly cant you do better than those two freaks
resentfully thank you kind sir
a vacuum cleaner salesman and a fairy doctor
a what kind of doctor
a fairy a queer
everybody in the building knows hes a queer
knowing better thats an interesting piece of news
youre the only woman he ever took out
still lives with his mother
you know she has no feet
you want him to abandon his mother who has no husband who has no money of her own who has no feet
how did she lose her feet
in a railroad accident many years ago
i was afraid to ask
norbert was just beginning practice
a real man would have sold her to a catfood company i suppose
as far as that goes j
edgar hoover still lives with his mother
i didnt know that
a lot of people dont
edgar hoover plays sports
i dont really know
to only exercise dr
woodly ever gets is playing the violin and making that stupid peace sign
makes the peace sign and says the word effeminately peace
lion doorbell roars
cringing i hate that thing
he goes to door admits woodly whom he loathes openly
wearing street clothes carrying a rolled up poster under his arm peace everybody paul penelope
youre taking mom out tonight
to penelope youre going out
herb shuttle is taking me to a fight
take plenty of cigars
an apology secret from paul we made the date three months ago
i must take you to an emergency ward sometime on a saturday night
thats also fun
i came to see selma as a matter of fact
she quit this afternoon
we dont have a maid any more
the animals made her sneeze and cry too much
im glad somebody finally cried
every time i come in here and see all this unnecessary death i want to cry
winking at paul acknowledging pauls low opinion of him i dont cry of course
not manly you know
did she try antihistamines
they made her so sleepy she couldnt work
throw out all this junk
this room crawls with tropical disease
everything stays as it is
a monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat
hotly my father
but you didnt know him and neither did i
hows your asthma
dont worry about it
hows the fungus around your thumbnail
concealing the thumb its fine
its jungle rot
this room is making everybody sick
this is your family doctor speaking now
unrolling the poster here i brought you something else to hang on your wall for the sake of variety
reading war is not healthy for children and other living things
no doubt paul thinks it stinks
lion doorbell roars
i hate that thing
going to the door keeps fairies away
he admits herb shuttle who carries an electrolux vacuum cleaner
to paul affectionately touching him hi kid
seeing woodly would you look what the car dragged in
im glad you brought your vacuum cleaner
is that a fact
that maid just quit
the place is a mess
you can start in the master bedroom
please hes not anybody to tell somebody else what to do in a master bedroom
ill get ready herb
i didnt expect you this soon
to all please wont everybody be nice to everybody else while im gone
all freeze except for penelope who comes forward to address the audience
lights on set fade as spotlight comes on
most men shunned me even when i nearly swooned for want of love
i might as well have been girdled in a chastity belt
my chastity belt was not made of iron and chains and chickenwire but of harolds lethal reputation
shuttle comes into the spotlight
i keep having this nightmare that he catches us
hed kill me
hed be right to kill me too the kind of guy he is
we havent done anything wrong you know
hed assume we had
thats something i suppose
all through the day im so confident
thats why im such a good salesman you know
i have confidence and i look like i have confidence and that gives other people confidence
people laugh sometimes when they find out im a vacuum cleaner salesman
they stop laughing though when they find out i made forty three thousand dollars last year
ive got six other salesmen working under me and what they all plug into is my confidence
thats what charges them up
i was captain of the wrestling team at lehigh university
if you want to wrestle you got lehigh
if you want to play tennis you go to vanderbilt
i dont want to go to vanderbilt
you dont wrestle if you dont have supreme confidence and i wrestled
but when i get with you and i say to myself my god here i am with the wife of harold ryan one of the great heroes of all time
something happens to my confidence
to the audience this conversation took place incidentally about three months before harold was declared legally dead
when harold is definitely out of the picture penelope when i dont have to worry about doing him wrong or you wrong or paul wrong
im going to ask you to be my wife
thats when ill get my confidence back
if youll pardon the expression thats when youll see the fur and feathers fly
shuttle and woodly argue in pitch darkness with paul listening and lights come up gradually to full on the living room the same evening
youve got to fight from time to time
or get eaten alive
thats not true either or neednt be unless we make it true
which we do
but we can stop doing that
the lights are full
shuttle and woodly are bored with each other woodly looks out the window speaks to an imaginary listener who has more brains than shuttle
paul hates them both but prefers shuttles noisy manliness
we simply stop doing that dropping things on each other eating each other alive
off in master bedroom suite coming
to paul women are always late
youll find out
thoughtfully the late mrs
im sick of this argument
i just have one more thing to say if you elect a president you support him no matter what he does
thats the only way you can have a country
its the planet thats in ghastly trouble now and all our brothers and sisters thereon
none of my relatives are chinese communists
speak for yourself
chinese maniacs and russian maniacs and american maniacs and french maniacs and british maniacs have turned this lovely moist nourishing blue green ball into a doomsday device
let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile and thats the end of mankind
you can believe that if you want
i talk to guys like you and i want to commit suicide
to paul you get that weight lifting set i sent you
it came yesterday
i havent opened it yet
musingly attempting to find the idea acceptable even funny in a way maybe its supposed to end now
maybe god wouldnt have it any other way
to paul start with the smallest weights
every week add a pound or two
maybe god has let everybody who ever lived be reborn so he or she can see how it ends
even pithecanthropus erectus and australopithecus and sinanthropus pekensis and the neanderthalers are back on earth to see how it ends
theyre all on times square making change for peepshows
or recruiting marines
to paul you ever hear the story about the boy who carried a calf around the barn every day
he died of a massive rupture
you think youre so funny
youre not even funny
to paul right
you dont hurt yourself if you start out slow
youre preparing him for a career in the slaughterhouses of dubuque
to paul take care of your body yes
but dont become a bender of horseshoes and railroad spikes
dont become obsessed by your musculature
any one of these poor dead animals here was a thousand times the athlete you can ever hope to be
their magic was in their muscles
your magic is in your brains
penelope enters from the bedroom dressed for the fight
she wears barbaric jewelry harold gave her years ago a jaguar skin coat over her shoulders
is this right for a fight
its been so long
ive never seen that coat
seven jaguars skins im told
harold shot every one
shall we go
sick about the slain jaguars oh no
wear a coat of cotton wear a coat of wool
wear a coat of domestic mink
for the love of god though penelope dont lightheartedly advertise that the last of the jaguars died for you
shes my date tonight
what do you want her to do bring the poor old jaguars back to life with a bicycle pump
ask paul what he thinks
to paul your mother looks beautiful right
paul pointedly declines to answer kid
paul walks away from him doesnt your mother look nice
he goes to paul wondering what is wrong paul
smolderingly i dont care what she wears
somethings made you sore
dont worry about it
you bet ill worry about it
i said something wrong
close to angry tears its my fathers birthday thats all
facing everybody raising his voice thats all
who cares about that
horrified raising his hand to swear an oath i had not the slightest inkling
to penelope feeling betrayed why didnt you say so
bitterly she doesnt care
shes not married any more
shes going to have fun
to penelope i hope you have so much fun you can hardly stand it
to woodly dr
woodly i hope you make up even better jokes about my father than the ones youve said so far
reaching out for paul kid kid to shuttle and i wish youd quit touching me all the time
it drives me nuts
reaching out again whats this
aghast you sure misunderstood something and wed better get it straight
explain it to them
im bugging out of here
he grabs a jacket from a chair
shuttle is in his way
dont touch me
get out of the way
men can touch other men and it doesnt mean a thing
havent you ever seen football players after theyve won the superbowl
to paul where will you be
anywhere but here
id just sit here and cry about the way my fathers been forgotten
i worship your father
that stuffed alligator your mother gave me the one he shot
its the proudest thing in my apartment
at the door everybody talks about how rotten kids act
grownups can be pretty rotten too
he exits through front door slams it
heartbroken kid kid its good
let him go
if hed just come out for the little league the way i asked him hed find out we touch all the time shove each other slug each other and just
im going to go get him dont
let him have all the privacy he wants
let him grieve let him rage
there has never been a funeral for his father
i never knew when to hold it or who to ask or what to say
tonights the night
if hed just get into scouting and camp out some and see how everybody roughhouses around the fire what a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites
i feel like ive been double crossed
to penelope peevishly if youd just told me it was harolds birthday what then
we could have had some kind of birthday party for him
we could have taken paul to the fight with us
minors arent allowed at fights
then wed stay home and eat venison or something and look through the scrapbooks
ive got a friend who has a whole freezer full of striped bass and caribou meat
going to the front door im going to bring that boy back
he exits through front door
going to penelope this is very good for us
the wilder paul is tonight the calmer hell be tomorrow
as long as he keeps out of the park
after this explosion i think hell be able to accept the fact that his mother is going to marry again
the only thing i ever told him about life was keep out of the park after the sun goes down
weve got to dump shuttle
pointing to the vacuum cleaner he brings his vacuum cleaner on dates
thats the xke
its an experimental model
he doesnt dare leave it in his car for fear it will fall into the hands of competition
what kind of a life is that
he told me one time what the proudest moment of his life was
he made eagle scout when he was twenty nine years old
clinging to him suddenly oh norbert promise me that paul has not gone into the park
pause if you warned him against it as much as you say its almost a certainty
three people murdered in there in the last six weeks
the police wont even go in there any more
i wish paul luck
id be dead by now if that were the case
every night penelope for the past two years ive made it a point to walk through the park at midnight
why would you do that
to show myself how brave i am
the issues in doubt you know since im always for peace im amazed
i know something not even the police know whats in the park at midnight
or when im in there theres me in there
fear and nobody and me
and maybe paul
what about the murderers
theyre in there
they didnt murder me
pauls only twelve years old
he can make the sound of human footsteps which is a terrifying sound
weve got to rescue him
if he is in the park luck is all that can save him now and theres plenty of that
hes not your son
but hes going to be
if he is in the park and he comes out safely on the other side i can say to him you and i are the only men with balls enough
to walk through the park at midnight
pause on that we can build
its a jungle out there
thats been said before
hed go to a movie
i think thats what hed do
if i were sure he was in a movie i could stop worrying
we could have him paged
lion doorbell roars
i hate that thing
he opens the door admits shuttle who carries a bakery box
did you see him
is he all right
far as i know
is he coming home
he ditched me
he started running and i started running then he lost me in the park
its dark in there
and thats where he is
i figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another
disgusted with him you figure
then i saw this bakery store that was still open so i bought a birthday cake
when paul comes home we can have some birthday cake
they had this cake somebody else hadnt picked up
it says happy birthday somebody else
happy birthday wanda june
we can take off the wanda june with a butter knife
did you talk to paul
before he started to run
he said his father carried a key to this apartment around his neck and someday wed all hear the sound of that key in the door
weve got to find him
preparing to exit through front door i want you to show me exactly where you saw him last
to woodly and you stay here norbert in case he comes home
to shuttle thats all he said the thing about the key
he said one other thing
it wasnt very nice
what was it
he told me to take a flying fuck at the moon
lights come up on living room
woodly is alone asleep on the couch
harold lets himself and looseleaf in through the front door quietly
harold has a full beard and a paunch
looseleaf is skinnier
he has a handlebar moustache
both wear new sports clothes and smoke expensive cigars
harold is calm
looseleaf is nervous confused
they prowl the room cautiously checking this and that
harold awakens woodly by playing with his feet
to looseleaf very amused ooops
can i uh help you gentlemen
moving downstage feeling at home gentlemen thats nice
to looseleaf you startled me
we just got here
i thought you might be burglars but youre not i hope
idiotically incapable of deception i got a lot of stuff
looking at him closely you do
the door ws unlocked
is it always unlocked
its always locked
but here you are inside arent you
youre youre old friends of harold ryan
we tried to be
we tried to be
hes dead you know
such a final word
to looseleaf did you hear that
woodly answers keeping his eyes on the bizarre guests
oh hello mother
to looseleaf hello mother
did she say how far apart the pains were
when was that
call her back tell her to head for the hospital
tell the hospital to expect her
ill leave right now
he hangs up faces the intruders
look im sorry i have to go
well miss you so
look this isnt my apartment and there isnt anybody else here
ryan wont be home for a while
oh oh oh i thought it was your apartment
you seemed at home here
im a neighbor
i have the apartment across the hall
i have to go to the hospital now
harold is unstirred
i mean i cant leave you here
youll have to go
ill tell mrs
ryan you were here
you can come back later
ahh then shes still alive
please and still mrs
will you please go
she still has just the one child the boy
he moves slowly toward the front door with woodly trying to hustle him and looseleaf out
stopping and what exactly is your relationship to mrs
i live across the hall
and you come into mrs
ryans apartment as often as you please looking into various health matters
youve got to get out right now
harold moves a little more stops again
just her neighbor and doctor
at the end of his patience blurting and her fiance
delighted and her fiance
i hope youll be very happy or is that what one says to the woman
ive got to run
he turns out the overhead light
you wish the woman good luck and you tell the man how fortunate he is
thats how it goes
holding open the front door ive literally got to run
i wont try to keep up with you
im not as fast on my feet as i once was
all three exit
a moment later harold lets himself and looseleaf in again with a key
he turns on the light again roams the room reacquainting himself with his beloved trophies
looseleaf is jangled by the adventure
harold chucks a lioness under her chin
miss me baby
i dunno boy
its a bitch
quietly a bitch
didnt recognize you
weve never met
i wonder wholl recognize us first
theyll wet their pants
i hope the men do
i would rather the women didnt
im gonna wet my pants
he laughs idiotically
looking around himself home sweet home
one thing anyway at least penelope didnt throw out all your crap
i bet alice threw out all my crap after id been gone a week
harold who wants to savor the early moments of his homecoming alone now tries to get the very jumpy looseleaf out of the apartment
it appears that were going to have to wait awhile for any more action here colonel
why dont you run on home while the evenings young
makes his hands tremble im like this
home is important to a man
you know what gets me
how all the magazines show tits today
used to be against the law didnt it
fed up with looseleaf i suppose
making no move to leave must have changed that law
silence while harold attempts to be alone even though looseleaf is still present
thoughtfully hefting a broadsword admiring its balance and strength home
you know what gets me
harold does not respond
you know what gets me
to himself oh shit
finding enough encouragement in this how everybody says fuck and shit all the time
i used to be scared shitless id say fuck or shit in public by accident
now everybody says fuck and shit fuck and shit all the time
something very big must have happened while we were out of the country
flatly looseleaf will you get the hell home
at least we found the diamonds
id really feel stupid if we didnt bring anything back home
its enough that youve brought yourself home
i wish youd tell alice that
and that goddamn mrs
hotly tell them yourself
you dont know my mother in law boy
after eight years in the jungle with you i know mrs
wheeler better than i know anybody in the universe
i didnt tell you everything
the time we were in a tree for fourteen days you certainly tried to tell me everything about mrs
i didnt even scratch the surface
youre lucky boy
you come home and nobodys here
when i go home everybodys going to be there
this room is full of ghosts
youre lucky boy
my house is gonna be filled with people
harold ignores this attempts to savor the ghosts in the room
you know what gets me
thank god we found the fucking diamonds
the hell with the diamonds
you were rich before
this is the first time i was ever rich
show them how rich you are for a change
can i have the cadillac
take the cadillac and drive it off a cliff for all i care
whatll you do for transportation
ill buy a hundred more cadillacs
you know what gets me about that cadillac
when i drive it i feel like im in the middle of a great big wad of bubblegum
i dont hear anything i dont feel anything
i figure somebody else is driving
its a bitch
im liable to find anything
thats the point
walk in there and find whatever there is to find before alice can cover it up
i know i know
at least shes in the same house
sure was spooky looking in the window there and there she was
so long colonel
you know what gets me
taking hold of looseleaf and steering him to the front door lets talk about it some other time
how short the skirts are
opening the door good night colonel
its been beautiful
something very important about sex must have happened while we were gone
harold shoves him out of the apartment and shuts the door
harold starts to roam the room again but the lion doorbell roars
going to the door hell
harold opens the door
looseleaf comes in
you know what gets me
those guys who went to the moon
to the moon boy
leave me alone
after eight years of horrendously close association the time has come to part
i crave solitude and time for reflection and then a reunion in privacy with my own flesh and blood
you and i may not meet again for months
im certainly not going to come horning back into your life tomorrow and i will not welcome your horning back into mine
a chapter has ended
we are old comrades at a parting of the ways
bleakly shrugging im lonesome already
roaming the room again the moon
the new heroism put a village idiot into a pressure cooker seal it up tight and shoot him at the moon
to his portrait hello there young man
in case youre wondering i could beat the shit out of you
and any woman choosing between us sorry kid shed choose me
pleased with the room i must say this room is very much as i left it
sees the cake whats this
happy birthday wanda june
who the hell is wanda june
music indicates happiness innocence and weightlessness
spotlight comes up on wanda june a lisping eight year old in a starched party dress
she is as cute as shirley temple
i am wanda june
today was going to be my birthday but i was hit by an ice cream truck before i could have my party
i am dead now
i am in heaven
that is why my parents did not pick up the cake at the bakery
i am not mad at the ice cream truck driver even though he was drunk when he hit me
it didnt hurt much
it wasnt even as bad as the sting of a bumblebee
i am really happy here
its so much fun
i am glad the driver was drunk
if he hadnt been i might not have got to heaven for years and years and years
i would have had to go to high school first and then beauty college
i would have had to get married and have babies and everything
now i can just play and play and play
any time i want any pink cotton candy i can have some
everybody up here is happy the animals and the dead soldiers and people who went to the electric chair and everything
theyre all glad for whatever sent them here
nobody is mad
were all too busy playing shuffleboard
so if you think of killing somebody dont worry about it
just go ahead and do it
whoever you do it to should kiss you for doing it
the soldiers up here just love the shrapnel and the tanks and the bayonets and the dum dums that let them play shuffleboard all the time and drink beer
spotlight begins to dim and carnival music on a steam calliope begins to intrude until at the end of the speech wanda june is drowned out and the stage is
we have merry go rounds that dont cost anything to ride on
we have ferris wheels
we have little league and girls basketball
theres a drum and bugle corps anybody can join
for people who like golf there is a par three golf course and a driving range with never any waiting
if you just want to sit and loaf why thats all right too
gourmet specialties are cooked to your order and served at any time of night or day
ha ha ha ha ha
pistol shot you got me pal
spotlight comes up on looseleaf harper who wears the clothes he will wear in the next scene new sports clothes a shirt open at the neck
as always he is friendly and embarrassed
when penelope asked me to say something about dropping the bomb on nagasaki i didnt give a very good answer i guess
its a very complicated question
jesus you know
you have to explain what its like to be in the air force and how they give you your orders and all that
what it feels like to be in a plane what the world looks like down there
after i got home from the war the minister of my church asked me if i would speak to a scout troop that met in the church basement
so i did
they met on thursday nights
i used to belong to that troop
i never made eagle scout
but you know something
its a very strange kind of kid that makes eagle scout
they always seem so lonesome like theyd worked real hard to get a job nobody else cares about
they get a whole bunch of merit badges
thats how you get to be an eagle scout
i dont think i had over five or six merit badges
the only one i remember is public health
that was a bitch
the boy scout manual said i was supposed to find out what my town did about sewage
jesus they just dumped it all in sugar creek
laughs idiotically sugar creek
that was a long time ago but its all coming back to me now
there was another merit badge you could get for roller skating
there used to be a roller rink at a bend in sugar creek up above where the sewage went in
i got in a fight there one time
i had on roller skates and the guy i was fighting had on basketball shoes
he had a tremendous advantage over me
he was a little guy but he beat the shit out of me
i had to laugh like hell
dont ever fight a guy when youve got on roller skates
silence jesus i remember my mother used to make me chew bananas for a full minute before i swallowed so i wouldnt get sick
makes you wonder what else your parents told you that wasnt true
spotlight comes up on harold
he sits on the front seat of an imaginary car
the seat is covered with zebra skin
the night i met penelope i had no beard so imagine me if you can without a beard
actually i wasnt as good looking then as i am now
and if anything me health has improved
at any rate i had just come home from kenya to discover that my third wife mildred like the two before her had become a drunken bum
in my experience alcoholism is far more prevalent among women than men
so i got into my automobile he pantomimes turning the ignition key
the sound of a starter and a powerful engine responds
he pantomimes putting the car in gear and driving away from the curb
appropriate sounds are heard
i drive through the night until i was attracted by a sign which said spotlight comes up on penelope who wears a skimpy carhop outfit she has had on under
her coat in the previous scene
harold pantomimes swerving into hamburger heaven
he pantomimes a stop kills the engine
he blows his imaginary horn
a real horn blows the bugle call for charge
penelope crosses to harold
can i help you sir
i think so daughter
how old are you
eighteen pause and a half
a springbok an oryx a gemsbok a gazelle
raw hamburger please and a whole onion
i want to eat the onion like an apple
do you understand
to the audience it was a very unusual automobile
it was a cadillac but it had water buffalo horns where the bumpers should be
to harold and what to drink
what time do you get off work my child
im sorry sir im engaged to be married
my boyfriend would be mad if i went out with another man
did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire
daughter i love you very much
you dont even know me
you are woman
i know woman well
this is crazy
destiny often seems that way
youre going to marry me
what do you do for a living
my parents died in an automobile accident when i was sixteen years old
they left me a brewery and a baseball team and other things
i live for a living
ive just come back from kenya in africa
ive been hunting mau mau there
some kind of animal
the pelt is black
its a kind of man
curtain rises on empty living room
paul lets himself in with a key
advances into room uneasily hello
sees the cake a cake
whos wanda june
harold enters quietly from the kitchen holding a can of beer
as a matter of fact nearly jumping out of his skin sir
as a matter of fact i am home
thinking harold may be a burglar hello
are you his voice fails him
hoping to be recognized you were about to ask a question
are you do you ask it
blurting do you know who wanda june is
life has denied me that thrill
do you mind if i ask who you are
aside god yes i mind
to paul im your fathers friend
a man claiming to be the family physician let me in a while ago
i should make a little list
is anybody besides you here now
the doctor was called away on an emergency
i think it was birth
you dont know where your mother is
does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night
she went to the fight with herb shuttle i guess
you think you could find me a pencil and paper
he rummages through a drawer
and youve been roaming the streets while your mother is god knows where
i was going to a funny movie but i changed my mind
if youre depressed laughing doesnt help much
gives harold pencil and paper when did you know my father
man and boy
everybody says he was so brave
even this herb shuttle you said
he worships father
and what sort of man is this worshiper
hes a vacuum cleaner salesman
deflated i see
recovering and he came into the apartment one day to demonstrate his wares and your mother as it happened was charmingly en deshabille she met him at college
they were in the same creative writing class
she has a masters degree in english literature
what a pity
educating a beautiful woman is like pouring honey into a fine swiss watch
pause and the doctor
he worships your father too
he insults him all the time
whats good about that
it makes life spicy
he doesnt do it in front of me but he does it with mother
indicating harolds portrait you know what he called father one time
harold the patron saint of taxidermy
measuring his opponent what does he do of an athletic nature
he plays a violin in a doctors quartet
he has a brilliant military record im sure
he was a stretcher bearer in the korean war
pause were you in a war with father
big ones little ones teeny weeny ones just and otherwise
tell me some true stories about dad
unused to the word dad
accepting it dad
to himself the boy wants tales of derring do
name a country
disgusted oh hell
dad was never in england
behind a desk for a little while
contemptuously a desk
they had him planning air raids
a city cant flee like a coward or fight like a man and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of harold ryan
there was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice and that was making the choice himself
ask about spain where he was the youngest soldier in the abraham lincoln brigade
he was a famous sniper
they called him la picadura the sting
echoing wonderingly the sting
as in death where is thy sting
he killed at least fifty men wounded hundreds more
slightly dismayed at such murderousness the sting
ask about the time he and i were parachuted into yugoslavia to join a guerrilla band in the war against the nazis
tell me that
i saw your father fight major siegfried von konigswald the beast of yugoslavia hand to hand
his excitement rising tell me that
tell me that
hid by day fought by night
at sunset one day your father and i peering through field glasses saw a black mercedes draw up to a village inn
it was escorted by two motorcyclists and an armored car
out of the mercedes stepped one of the most hateful men in all of history the beast of yugoslavia
we blacked our hands and faces
at midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village
the name of the village was mhravitch
remember that name
we came up behind a sentry and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound
dont care for cold steel
a knife is worse than a bullet
i dont know
the story gets hairier
should i stop
we caught another kraut alone in a back lane
your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire
your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire
thats nicer than a knife isnt it as long as you dont look at the face afterwards
the face turns a curious shade of avocado
i must ask the doctor why that is
at any rate we stole into the back of the inn and with the permission of the management we poisoned the wine of six krauts who were carousing there
where did you get the poison
we carried cyanide capsules
we were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured
it was your fathers opinion that the krauts needed them more than we did at the time
and one of them was the beast of yugoslavia
the beast was upstairs and he came running downstairs for his men were making loud farewells and last wills and testaments editorializing about the hospitality they had received
and your father said to him in perfect german which he had learned in the spanish civil war major something tragic seems to have happened to your bodyguard
i am harold ryan of the united states of america
you i believe are the beast of yugoslavia
the sounds of a nazi rally come up slowly sieg heil
spotlight comes up on major siegfried von konigswald and officer in the dreaded ss
he is in full ceremonial uniform
the sounds fade
sadly resignedly remembering ja ja
pause i am major siegfried von konigswald
they used to call me the beast of yugoslavia on account of all the people i had tortured and shot and hanged
wed bop em on the head
wed hook em up to the electricity
wed stick em with hypodermic syringes full of all kinds of stuff
one time we killed a guy with orange juice
there was a train wreck and two of the freight cars were loaded with oranges so we had oceans of orange juice
it was a joke how much orange juice we had
and we were interrogating a guy one day and he wouldnt talk and the next thing i know somebodys filling up this big syringe with orange juice
pause there was a guerrilla war going on
you couldnt tell who was a guerrilla and who wasnt
even if you got one it was still a civilian you got
telling americans what a guerrilla war is like thats coals to newcastle
how do you like that for idiomatic english
coals to newcastle
laughs that harold ryan he says he spoke to me in perfect german
he talks german like my ass chews gum
im glad to hear the wonderful thing he said before he killed me
i sure didnt understand it the first time around
i figured he was a lithuanian or something which will give you an idea of how wrong you can be
all i knew was he was very proud about something and he had a machine pistol and it was aimed at me
the woods were full of all kinds of nuts who were proud of some damn thing or other and they all had guns
they were always looking for revenge
you find a way to bottle revenge thats the end of schnapps und coca cola
pause harold ryan said he killed maybe two hundred guys
i killed a hundred times that many i bet
thats still peanuts of course compared to what that crazy looseleaf did
harold and me we was doing it the hard way
i hope the record books will show that
there should be a little star or something by the names of the guys who did it the hard way
pause im up in heaven now like that little wanda june kid
i wasnt hit by no ice cream truck
harold ryan killed me with his bare hands
he was good
my eyes popped out
my tongue stuck out like a red banana
i shit in my pants
it was a mess
pause when i got up on the day i died i said what a beautiful day this is
what a beautiful part of the world
the whole planet was beautiful
up here i meet guys from other planets
laughs we got some really crazy looking guys up here
their planets werent anywhere near as nice as earth
they had clouds all the time
they never saw a clear blue sky
they never saw snow
they never saw an ocean
they had some little lakes but you couldnt go swimming in them
the lakes were acid
you go swimming you dissolve
we got some guys up here who got shoved in them lakes
pause harold ryan stopped talking german to me there in yugoslavia
he switched to english so i finally got some kind of idea what he was so burned up about
he wanted revenge for the guy we killed with orange juice
i dont know how he ever found out about it
there was just three of us there when we did it me and two regular military doctors
somebody who cleaned up afterwards must have squealed
if id lived through the war and they tried me for war crimes and all that id have to tell the court i guess i was only following orders as
a good soldier should
hitler told me to kill this guy with orange juice
lights come up on living room
harold has just finished telling his true war story to paul
remember that name
the name will live forever
it was there that harold ryan slew the beast of yugoslavia
when i grow up im going to go to mhravitch
its rather a disappointment these days
it isnt there any more
the germans shot everybody who lived there then leveled it plowed it planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground
they wished revenge for the slaying of the beast of yugoslavia
to their twisted way of thinking your father had butchered an eagle scout
abruptly play lots of contact sports
i wanted to go out for football but mom was afraid id get hurt
youre supposed to get hurt
woodly says hes seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football
he says that when theres a war everybody goes but football players
does it bother you to have your mother engaged to a man like that
theyre not engaged
he seems to think they are
he told me that were
oh no no no no no
it cant be
unexpectedly moved youre a very good boy to respond that way
no no no no no
id like to use the sanitary facilities if i may
as harold exits no no no no
penelope and shuttle enter through front door
they are tremendously relieved to see paul
what a relief
going to paul my babys safe
paul angrily avoids her touch
whats the matter now
we got a birthday cake kid
did you see the cake
are you and dr
stunned who have you been talking to
what difference does that make
woodly going to be my father now
yes he is
a stifled gargling cry aaaaaaaaaaaaaah
sick that goes double for me
i dont want to live any more
i feel like i want to yell my head off just yell anything
yelling bulllllllllllllll dickey
ill kill myself
the wife of harold ryan is going to marry a pansy next
this is the end of western civilization as far as im concerned
you must be crazy as a fruitcake
how long has this been going on
we were waiting for the right time to i feel as though i had been made a perfect chump of
marry me instead
thank you herb
youre a wonderful man
you really are
everybody respects you for what youve done for scouting and the little league
youre saying no
im saying no and thank you
i didnt make my move fast enough
thats it isnt it
i was too respectful
you were wonderful
whats so wonderful if i lost the sale
turning to paul you poor kid
dont touch me
wouldnt you rather have your mother marry me than him
moving dazedly toward the front door all my dreams have suddenly collapsed
pause we did have a lot of laughs together penelope
well it was nice while it lasted
thanks for the memories
a toilet flushes loudly and complicatedly
is norbert still here
then who flushed the toilet
whats his name
for heavens sakes
harold enters still adjusting his trousers
how do you do
how do you do mrs
id heard you were beautiful and so you are
am i intruding here
not at all
i couldnt help overhearing that you were about to get married again
penelope has now recognized him but attempts to protect herself from shock by pretending that she has not
our family physician has asked me to marry him
paul needs the guidance and companionship that only a man can give
he isnt at all like harold
but then again im not the woman i was eight years ago
she slumps into a chair buries her face in her hands
pointing weakly that man is your father
there stands the loins from which youve sprung
i dont get it
it is you isnt it harold
enjoying the drama hugely yes wife it is
to paul come here boy
your father is home
go to him
paul goes to harold dazedly
they embrace clumsily
son son son
father father father
they part unsatisfied and confused
harold goes to penelope his arms outstretched
wife wife wife
penelope struggles to her feet her face blank
harold embraces her finds himself wrestling with a rigid unresponsive object
wife wife wife
harold lets go backs away from her
whats the matter
tearful give us time
like hugging a lamp post
give us time harold to adjust to your being alive
you were well adjusted to my being dead
we adjust to what there is to adjust to
perhaps paul being young can adjust to joy or grief immediately
i hope he can
i will take a little longer
ill be as quick as i can
what sort of time period do you have in mind
half an hour
i dont know
this is a new disease to me
this reunion isnt what i imagined it would be
a telegram a phone call might have helped
seemed the most honest way to begin life together again natural unrehearsed
well enjoy the natural honest unrehearsed result surgical shock
you feel that youre behaving as a woman should
every fuse in my nervous system has been blown
lion doorbell roars
paul answers the door admits woodly
to paul safe and sound i see
to harold oh you came back
i came back
you know each other
we met here earlier this evening
how was the emergency doctor
profitable i hope
a policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab
youll have to split the fee
puzzled by penelopes mood are are you crying penelope
shes crying because shes so happy
thats why im crying
indicating harold you know who this is
i didnt get his name
a friend of your father
he isnt any friend of father
he is my father
woodly i would like you to meet harold my husband
harold this is dr
woodly my fiance
she crosses to the door of the master bedroom kissing each male lightly as she passes
good night dear
good night dear
she stands in the doorway
stay or go talk or sulk laugh or cry as you wish
do whatever seems called for
my mind is gone
she exits into bedroom closes the door firmly locks it audibly
dazedly i feel the same way
you leave promptly of course
there is no question as to whose home this is none
whose son this is whose wife that is
a fiance is the most ridiculous appurtenance this household could have at this time
crushed without any possible comeback good night
he exits through the front door
harold goes at once to penelopes door tries it finds it locked
god damn it
he considers kicking down the door thinks better of this turns away
wants to fix up her makeup no doubt
is looseleaf harper alive
alive and hale
hes throwing a little surprise party for his own family
is your mother often this unstable
not waiting for an answer calling again penelope
shes a real heavy sleeper sometimes
why dont you go to bed son
i cant take my eyes off you
tomorrows another day
you know what my english literature teacher said about you
cant it keep till morning
she said you were legendary
i wrote a theme about you and she said your father is a legendary hero out of the golden age of heroes
you thank her for me
go to bed and get lots of sleep and then you thank her in the morning
anyway shes dead
she was killed in the park two months ago in the daytime
she was on her way home from a meeting of the african violet society and they got her
sharply will you go to bed
stung yes sir
if you cant wake mom up ive got double decker bunks
stamping his foot scat
paul exits hastily down the corridor to his room
harold goes to penelopes door attempts to woo her through it
penelope darling can you hear me
wife you know what kept me alive all these fevered swampy nightmare years
your heavenly face penelope my wife shimmering before me coaxing me up from my knees begging me to stagger one step closer to home
has love ever reached so far
has love ever overcome more hardships than mine
silence has love ever asked more manliness of a man more womanliness of a woman
has ever a man done more for a womans reward
the bedroom door opens revealing penelope
hollowly to the world at large there is no one in here of any earthly use to anyone tonight
tomorrow is another day
she closes the door and locks it
to audience end of act one
paul alone in the living room hammers on his mothers door
he wears pajamas
lights come up on the living room
it is morning
dads got jungle fever mom
whatll i do
a moment of exhaustion damn
door to the master bedroom suite opens
penelope appears in the doorway
she has decided during an almost sleepless night that she owes it to paul and to her own self respect to explore the possibility of beginning her life with harold
she is terrified of him
she hopes that if she can keep calm and open her fears will diminish
perhaps she can love him again
attempting to behave mechanically as a good wife should what are his symptoms
shivers and sweats and groans
his teeth chatter
whatll we do
what does he say to do
he can hardly talk
responding to a last twinge of nausea bluh
youd better get dr
it is an emergency isnt it
then get him
thinking she has made a mistake okay
he exits through front door leaves door open
we hear him knocking on a door in the hallway
harold enters drained but recovering
he chews on a root
he has slept in the shirt and trousers he wore the night before
he is barefoot
paul knocks again
there is the sound of woodlys door opening
woodly and paul speak unintelligibly woodly evidently inviting paul in for a moment
woodlys door closes
whats that all about
we thought a doctor might help
your old beau
we thought it was an emergency
i dont want that chancre mechanic in here
hes a very decent man harold
we all are
shouldnt you lie down
when im dead throwing it away or fucking
paul said you were awfully sick
i was i was
it never lasts long
he hears woodlys door open is alert to woodlys approach continues to speak to penelope absently
the indians call it zamba keetya the little cloudburst
woodly and paul enter
woodly is correctly professional and carries a little black bag
what a brilliant diagnosis
you know what i want
all look at her i want you both to be friends
i know you both respect you both
you should be friends
nothing would please me more
believing him thank god
pleased but careful well now what seems to be the trouble with the patient today
a touch of malaria perhaps
i know malaria
malaria isnt caused by the bites of bats
youve been bitten by bats
colonel harper and i once shared a treetop with a family of bats
there was a flash flood
there were piranha fish in the water
thats how colonel harper lost his little toe
you have chills
chills fevers sweats
you can describe it and name it after yourself the woodly galloping crud
woodly enjoys the joke and the blooming friendship
you can also describe its cure
im eating its cure
i was going to ask
would you say that again
means cougar fang
cures anything but a yellow streak down the back
ive never heard of it
by crossing twenty eight feet of cockroach infested carpet youve become the third white man ever to hear of it
fascinated are youve seen it work cures
im so glad you like each other
i was so scared so scared
breaking off a piece offering it have some
thank you very much
i believe in miracles now
wasnt that sweet of me
more and more we find ourselves laying aside false pride and looking into the pharmacopoeias of primitive people
curare ephedrine weve found some amazing things
we have have we
thats an editorial we of course
i havent turned up anything personally
everything about you is the editorial we
take that away from you and youd disappear
i could carve a better man out of a banana
please you and your damned bedside manner and your damned little black bag full of miracles
you know who filled that bag for you
not alice sit by the fires like yourself
men with guts filled it by god men with guts enough to pay the price for miracles suffering ingratitude loneliness death off balance good lord
i can just hear the editorial wee wee weeing when looseleaf and i start flying in pacqualinincheewa root
i can hear the alice sit by the fires now we discovered it in the amazon rain forest
now we cure you with it
now we lower our eyes with becoming modesty as we receive heartfelt thanks
harold suddenly goes to woodly takes his hand and pretends abject gratitude
oh bless you doctor bless you oh healer oh protector oh giver of life
woodly withdraws his hand examines it as though it were diseased
he doesnt deserve this
you dont know him
it isnt fair
he thought he could take my place
it is now my privilege to give an unambiguous account of why i dont think hes man enough to do that
i thought she was a widow
you were wrong you quack
approaching woodly but not getting too close i cant tell you how sorry i am
say hello to your mother
fervently do say hello to your mother
im taking her to the airport a few minutes from now
shes going to east st
louis to visit an aunt
tell her to have a nice trip
moving towards the front door thanks
this stings woodly to a cold peace loving anger
im going to have to report you to the department of health
you may be suffering from a loathsome disease which the american people could do without
he exits instantly
now thats what i call fun
ghastly cruel unnecessary
youll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again
you used to eat it up
we were one hell of a pair and well be one again
what we need is a honeymoon
lets start right now
a trip you mean
i had a trip
well honeymoon here
to paul go out and play
your mother and i do not wish to be disturbed for three full hours
he hasnt had breakfast yet
buy yourself breakfast
takes his billfold from his hip pocket hands paul a bill there we go
a hundred dollars
the smallest thing ive got
can i get dressed first
make it fast
paul exits to his bedroom
harold turns to penelope
say it honeymoon
its so so stark
you used to like it stark
just bang we have a honeymoon
beginning to stalk her cunningly im not going to strike you
i am going to be as gentle as pie as lemon meringue pie
you mustnt run away now
this is your loving husband approaching
im your husband
penelope wants to run but doesnt
you held your ground
harold is very close now but not touching her
now turn around if you would
laughing im not about to introduce to you a jungle novelty
what i have in mind is massage a perfectly decent massage
turn around turn around
im going to touch your shoulders very gently now
you mustnt scream
touches her shoulders gently expertly so tense so tense
you shouldnt have talked to norbert that way
youre thinking with your brain instead of your body
thats why youre so tense
its body time
i have a brain
we all do
but now its body time
ideally the body of a woman should feel like a hot water bottle filled with devonshire cream
you feel like a paper bag crammed with curtain rods
think of your muscles one by one
let them go slack
let the brain go blank
thats the idea thats my girl
now the small of the back
let those knots over those kidneys unsnarl
entering dressed to go out and play dad hanging on to penelope but knowing the mood has been broken couldnt you have vanished quietly out the back door
a hundred dollars for breakfast
leave a tip
suddenly twisting away having been nearly hypnotized i have some change
ram it up your ass
he realizes at once that his violent side has severely damaged the side of him which is the great seducer
penelope and paul are straight as ramrods
i do beg your pardon
sincerely those words were illy chosen
there is tension in all of us here
something you must both understand however is that the head of this household is home and he is harold ryan and people do what he says when he says it
thats the way this particular clock is constructed
lion doorbell roars
sometimes even i hate that thing
paul goes reeling to the door in terror admits looseleaf who has also been sleeping in his clothes
walking right in ive been looking at motorcycles
you ever own a motorcycle
to penelope youre right
well take a trip
a trip is what well take
to looseleaf i dont want to talk about motorcycles
i dont want to talk about tits
havent got one
to looseleaf and you went home unannounced too
and how were things
lets talk about something else
to harold alice got married again
you didnt even find that out
there was so much going on
she married an accountant named stanley kestenbaum
so thats it
everybody was yelling kestenbaum kestenbaum
i thought it was some foreign language
otherwise how are things
i sure didnt expect her to drop dead
sick alice is dead
no no shit no
stops short excuse me penelope
for saying shit
or is that okay now
shrilly whos dead
my mother in law
fire engines pulmotors doctors cops coroners what happened
well i walked up to the front door
i was still alive
i rang the doorbell and old mrs
she had her goddamn knitting
i said guess who
she conked right out
i never did get any sense out of alice
she found me holding up the old lady dead as a mackerel
it was a bitch
you know maybe mrs
wheeler was going to die then and there anyway even if id been the paper boy
i dunno boy
thats civilian life for you
who knows what kills anybody
could have happened to anybody
first nagasaki now this
how about breakfast wife
as though to a waitress scrambled eggs kippered herring fried potatoes and a whole onion
i want to eat the onion like an apple
do you understand
penelope turns away
and lots of orange juice oceans of orange juice
wheeler is dead
all right bring me a side order of mrs
regarding looseleaf resigning himself to being stuck with his company for a little while longer oh hell sit down colonel
penelope will bring you some chow
that is the most heartless statement i ever heard pass between human lips
honestly mystified which one
chokingly bring me a side order of mrs
shes up in heaven now
she didnt hear
she is experiencing nothing but pure happiness
theres nothing nicer than that
suddenly angrily slamming a table with his fist chow
harold ryan wants chow
what a honeymoon
honeymoon temporarily canceled
catching sight of paul whose physical appearance really offends him the boy should still go out and exercise
i have the impression he never gets any exercise
he simply bloats himself with fig newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators
then let me see him go out and get some exercise
explosively right now
paul goes reeling in terror to the front door opens it
to harold abjectly what kind of exercise
beat the shit out of someone who hates you
harold pounds on a table
chow chow chow
god damn it nutriment
were all going to have to go out for breakfast
the cook quit yesterday
youre a woman arent you
then we have a cook
cook by god
youre the nigger now
people dont use that word any more
dont lecture me on race relations
i dont have a molecule of prejudice
ive been in battle with every kind of man there is
ive been in bed with every kind of woman there is from a laplander to a tierra del fuegian
if id ever been to the south pole thered be a hell of a lot of penguins who looked like me
you leave me so so without without dignity
people now have dignity when frying eggs
they dont have to feel like slaves
grandly then go now and fry with dignity sunnyside up
penelope attempts to respond to this but is too enraged
she exits making a tiny mosquito like hum
i dunno boy
the educational process
youre lucky you dont have any old people around here
she was about to get married again
she locked me out of the bedroom last night
looseleaf starts to laugh
harold shuts him up
whats funny about that
apologetically you know me boy
penelope enters from the kitchen with a question on her lips
i should have torn that door off its hinges
should have scrogged her ears off
should have broken the bed
seeing penelope what do you want
words fail her well
i i was wondering is there anything you shouldnt eat because of jungle fever
i could eat a raw baby crocodile
turning to looseleaf crassly the way to get your wife back is in bed
do such a job on her that shell be lucky if she can crawl around on all fours
to penelope were starving
do you mind
penelope exits dumbly detesting the word scrog which she has never heard before
she had two lovers by the way
looseleaf starts to laugh again stops the laugh as harold glowers
one of them is the doctor whose weapons are compassion unselfishness peacefulness maudlin concern
he and his love are like a retiarius
do you know what a retiarius is
hes a kind of gladiator who fights with a knife and a net and doesnt wear anything but a jockstrap
amazed how do you know that
you told me
when we were up in the tree so long with the bats
fourteen times you told me
youd get this funny look in your eyes and id say to myself oh jesus hes going to tell me what a retiarius is again
acknowledging a flaw in a manly way sorry
penelope enters is about to speak
harold stops her with a raised finger
let me guess breakfast is served
i do not wish to be scrogged ever
i never heard that word but when i heard it i knew it was one thing i never wanted to have happen to me
thats what youre supposed to say
this is not a coy deception
i do not want to be scrogged
i want love
i want tenderness
you dont know you want
thats the way god built you
i will not be scrogged
i remember one time i saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers and you promised me that the fish couldnt feel
id like to have the expert opinion of the fish along with yours
shaking his head fish cant feel
well i can
some injuries spiritual or physical can be excruciating to me
im not a silly carhop any more
an unexpected minor insight maybe youre right about fish
when i was a carhop i didnt feel much more than a fish would
but ive been sensitized
i have ideas now and solid information
i know a lot more now and a lot of it has to do with you
sensing danger such as
the whole concept of heroism and its sexual roots
tell me about its sexual roots
its complicated and i dont want to go into it now because its bound to sound insulting even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted
its just the truth
i like the truth
i wouldnt be alive today if i werent one of the biggest fans truth ever had
well part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long and make awful messes while theyre there
blurting and they have very mixed feelings about women
they hate them in a way
one reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently
they can scrog them as you say pause for revenge
you learned this in some college course
i learned a lot of things in college
actually it was norbert who told me that
darkly the doctor
and what is his most cherished possession
not sensing the drift of the conversation his most cherished possession
his violin i guess
and he keeps it in his apartment
still at sea yes
and no ones there now
i dont think so
thats too bad
i would rather have him at home to see what im going to do
suddenly catching on sick with fear what are you going to do
he did his best to destroy my most precious possession which is the high opinion women have of me
im now going to even that score
im going to break in his door and im going to smash his violin
no youre not
because if you do ill leave you
promptly and emotionlessly goodbye
spotlight comes up on von konigswald and wanda june dressed as before
they have become close friends
we have this new club up here in heaven
yes we do
we only have two members so far but its growing all the time
we have enough for a shuffleboard team
in heaven shuffleboard is everything
hitler plays shuffleboard
albert einstein plays shuffleboard
mozart plays shuffleboard
lewis carroll who wrote alice in wonderland plays shuffleboard
jack the ripper plays shuffleboard
walt disney who gave us snow white and the seven dwarfs plays shuffleboard
jesus christ plays shuffleboard
it was almost worth the trip to find out that jesus christ in heaven was just another guy playing shuffleboard
i like his sense of humor though you know
hes got a blue and gold warm up jacket he wears
you know what it says on the back
pontius pilate athletic club
most people dont get it
most people think there really is a pontius pilate athletic club
were going to have jackets arent we
the harold ryan fan club
with a yellow streak up the back
both laugh we got very good tailor shops up here
theyll make you any kind of uniform any kind of sweatsuit you want
judas iscariot hes got this black jacket with a skull and crossbones over the heart
he walks around all hunched over and he never looks anybody in the eye and written on the back of his jacket are the words go take a flying wanda
june punches him in the ribs
leap at the moon
mildred harolds third wife enters
she is voluptuous blowzy tough about forty five
she has trouble with alcohol
von konigswald is expecting her
youre mildred right
i heard you were looking for me
you were harold ryans third wife
you want to join the harold ryan fan club
wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back
do i have to
whos the little girl
ryan just borrowed my birthday cake
i dont really know him
thought you were another wife maybe
im only ten years old
thats what he wanted a ten year old wife
hed come home from a war or a safari and hed wind up talking to the little kids
wont you please join our club
honey alcoholics anonymous takes all the time ive got and harold ryan is an individual i would rather forget
he drove me to drink
he drove his first two wives to drink
because he was cruel
covering wanda junes little ears premature ejaculation
no grown woman is a fan of premature ejaculation
harold would come home trumpeting and roaring
he would the kick the furniture with his boots spit into corners and the fireplace
he would make me presents of stuffed fish and helmets with holes in them
he would tell me that he had now earned the reward that only a woman could give him and hed tear off my clothes
he would carry me into the bedroom telling me to scream and kick my feet
that was very important to him
i did it
i tried to be a good wife
he told me to imagine a herd of stampeding water buffalo
i couldnt do that but i pretended i did
it was all over ten seconds after hed said the word buffalo
then hed zip up his pants and go outside and tell true war stories to the little kids
any little kids
that is sad
blankly is it
pause i have this theory about why men kill each other and break things
its a dumb theory
i was going to say it was all sexual
but everything is sexual
making peace sign peace
making peace sign making peace sign peace
ha ha ha ha ha
pistol shot you got me pal
a baby cries
the lights come up
go to the funeral
not only go to it but go to it in full uniform
rent a uniform
thats against the law isnt it
i cant wear a uniform anymore
wear your uniform and every decoration and let them despise you if they dare
alice would be absolutely tear ass
when i was a naive young recruit in spain i used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos
i now understand it was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform uncontrollable fear
raises his glass to our women
i didnt know we had any women left
the world is teeming with women ours to enjoy
every time i start thinking like that i get the clap
lion doorbell roars
going to the door this could be my next wife
he admits herb shuttle who carries a bouquet of roses
puzzled by harold hello
how are you honeybunch
is penelope in
the posies are for her
i wanted to apologize
youve come to the right man
i forgot my vacuum cleaner
i forget mine for years on end
suddenly realizing who harold is oh my god pause points and you are looseleaf harper
crowing its what ive dreamed of all my life looseleaf
to have a grown man realize who i was and faint
to audience end of act two
mildred enters drunkenly up aisle sits precariously on apron of stage and speaks to audience
two days later
the afternoon of the day of looseleaf harpers mother in laws funeral
you got it
two days later
pause you know what happened in heaven today
there was a tornado
im not kidding you there was a goddamn tornado
tore up fifty six houses a dance pavilion and a ferris wheel
drove a shuffleboard stick clear through a telephone pole
nobody got killed
nobody ever gets killed
they just bounce around a lot
then they get up and start playing shuffleboard
pause i never saw a tornado when i was alive and i grew up in oklahoma
theres this big black funnel shaped cloud
sounds like a railroad train without the whistle
i had to come to heaven to see a thing like that
a lot of people got photographs
pause after the tornado was over a man had some film left and he wanted to take pictures of me to use up the roll
i dont like people who go around taking pictures of everything
nothings real to some people unless theyve got photographs
pause two days later right
she exits clumsily the way she came
lights come up on the living room which has become a pigpen
looseleaf harold shuttle and paul sit around a dinner of nearly raw beefsteak set on the coffee table
looseleaf wears an ill fitting uniform which he has rented
i told you the uniform wouldnt help
it helped more than you know
down deep people were deeply affected
you keep on saying deep and deeply
i wish something good would happen on the surface sometime
i cant get over how you guys are my friends
harold ryan and looseleaf harper are my friends
eight years you guys were together through thick and thin
for seven and a half of those years we were heavily drugged or we would have been home long before now believe me
we were saved from starvation by the lupi loopo indians who fed us a strange blue soup
it sapped our will made us peaceful and unenterprising
it was a form of chemical castration
we became two more sleepy indians
to paul so kid how they hanging
or dont you say that to a little kid
hes a man
to paul tell him youre a man
im a man
weve got to do something to make this boys voice change
i wonder if we couldnt get bull balls somewhere and fry em up
to paul still miss your mother
youre free to go to her if you want
if youd rather be a woman and run with the women just say the word
are we really going to find out where the elephants go to die
id rather go to viet nam
would somebody please pass me the catsup
what you say is pass the fucking catsup
pass the fucking catsup
looseleaf gives it to him
shuttle dumps catsup on his steak
i keep thinking about africa and the elephants
i dont think ill go
of course youll go
youre going to fly the helicopter
youre so low
look at that beautiful red meat
you havent touched it
at least youve got a place to come back to
i dont have a place to come back to anymore
all the more reason to go to africa
pause i used to really love that alice
do you know that
you know her for what she is now garbage
she was always a rotten wife
she was against everything manly you ever wanted to do
to shuttle he was the most daring test pilot in the country at one time and his wife made him quit
she made him become a life insurance salesman instead
id think any woman worth her salt would be proud to be married to a test pilot
i know i would
she tried to like it
she was a very nervous woman
i could tell that at the funeral
to paul would you please pass the fucking catsup again
was it dangerous testing planes
you know youre up there and youre in some plane nobody ever flew before
you put her into a dive and everything starts screaming and shaking and maybe some pipe breaks and squirts oil or gasoline or hydraulic fluid in your face
you wonder how the hell you ever got in such a mess and then you pull back on the controls and you black out for a couple of seconds
when you come to everythings usually fairly okay except maybe you threw up all over yourself
its just another job but you try and tell alice that
you actually sold insurance
indicating harold i sold him some
that was the only insurance i ever sold
hyena doorbell laughs
what an awful sound
get used to it
to paul back door paul
paul exits to the kitchen
to shuttle its possible of course that youll die in africa
ive considered that
selling vacuum cleaners isnt the best preparation you could have
i just want one true adventure before i die
that can be arranged
paul appears at the mouth of the doorway
he has something amazing to announce
who was it
he steps aside
harold and shuttle stand harold angrily
openly cheerfully hi penelope
to looseleaf shut up you ninny
to penelope you were never to come here again for any reason whatsoever
i came for my clothes
sneaking in the back door
it seemed like the proper door for a servile worthless organism to use
your clothes are at the city dump by now
perhaps you can get a map from the department of sanitation
i came for paul as well
if he wants to go
you took him to the funeral i hear
hed never seen a corpse
hes seen a dozen now
its a big and busy funeral home
to paul did you like it dear
it isnt a matter of liking
its a matter of getting used to death as a perfectly natural thing
would you mind leaving
no woman ever walks out on harold ryan and then comes back for anything
unless she has nerve
more nerve than the doctor i must admit
he hasnt been home for two days
has he suddenly lost interest in sleep and color television and the violin
he knows you shattered his violin
im dying to hear of his reaction
the thrill of smashing something isnt in the smashing but in the owners reactions
about a broomstick and a cigar box and the attenuated intestines of an alley cat
two hundred years old
he feels awful loss which was precisely my intention
moving toward the violin and incidentally placing herself much closer to shuttle he had hoped that someone would be playing it still two hundred years from now
echoing expressing the futility of such long term expectations hope
he spots the vacuum cleaner probes it with his toe asks shuttle with seriousness
do you hope with all your heart that someone will be using this vacuum cleaner two hundred years from now
shuttle starts to answer but stops supposing that he is being made sport of
youre making a joke
not joking im interested in long term expectations
flatly protecting his dignity its engineered to last about fifteen years
downstage center addressing the civilized world things
oh you silly people and your things
things things things
to shuttle as harold reflects majestically on the emptiness of materialism you and harold are friends
revealing how mixed and worried his feelings are hes the most wonderful guy i ever met penelope
hes the most complicated guy i ever met
i cant believe it but hes going to take me to africa with him
you feel ive done a dreadful thing leaving him
almost hypnotized if i were married to him i sure wouldnt walk out
directly to the audience never mind the condition of your body and your spirit
look after your things your things
to looseleaf and you colonel
let me guess you dont know
to the audience go live in a safe deposit box with your things
jesus i wouldnt want to be married to him
i wouldnt want to be married to me
were too crazy
in what way pray tell
i didnt like that violin thing
that was sad
tit for tat as simple as that
you never played a violin
i practically forgot
but after you busted that thing i got to thinking jesus maybe ill start the violin again
that didnt just belong to woodly
that belonged to everybody
maybe he would have sold it to me and i could have some fun
after you busted the violin boy and penelope walked out i thought to myself jesus who could blame her
maybe its time you got out
youre an imbecile
i know you think that
everybody thinks that
anybody whod drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb
the one direct decisive intelligent act of your life
shaking his head i dont think so
pause it could have been
if i hadnt done it
if id said to myself screw it
im going to let all those people down there live
they were enemies
we were at war
yeah jesus but wars would be a lot better i think if guys would say to themselves sometimes jesus im not going to do that to the enemy
thats too much
you could have been the manufacturer of that violin there even though you dont know how to make a violin just by not busting it up
i could have been the father of all those people in nagasaki and the mother too just by not dropping the bomb
pause i sent em to heaven instead and i dont think there is one
looseleaf walks around and gathers his things
so long you guys
what will you do colonel
marry the first whore whos nice to me i guess
get a job in a motorcycle shop
so long you guys
penelope kisses looseleaf
everybody but harold acknowledges his departure is some way
harold turns his back
looseleaf exits closes door
whos going to fly our helicopter now
blackly tautly what
we got to get another pilot
do you really think that harold ryan would go to africa with a vacuum cleaner salesman
you invited me
to make an ass of yourself
what went wrong
were ahead of schedule thats all
youre finding out here what you would have found out in africa that you are a rabbit born to be eaten alive
gee whiz it would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us
i wouldnt drop my gun
youre hollow like a woman
im smarter than looseleaf
he can shoot
he can hold his ground
he can attack
youre in your proper profession right now sucking up dirt for frumpish housewives closet drunkards every one
close to tears how do you know how id act in africa
look how youre acting now
this is a moment of truth and youre almost crying
youre my buddy
no matter what you say to me i still think youre the greatest guy i ever knew
you you arent going to have any friends left if you dont watch out
he propels shuttle out the door and slams it
he faces penelope and paul speaks with malicious calm
well what have we here
almost a christmas scene
goodbye goodbye goodbye
just one favor
theres plenty of that
mildred got the brewery
youll probably get the baseball team
i want you to tell me that you loved me once
harold is about to dismiss this request majestically but penelope cuts him off with a sharp dangerous warning
i mean it
i must have that and so must paul
tell him that he was conceived in love even though you hate me now
tell both of us that somewhere is our lives was love
harold experiments inwardly with responses of various kinds obviously saying them to himself directing himself with his hands
nothing quite satisfies him
testimonials of that sort are are beyond my range
i dont do them well
sincerely not liking to fail in any way thats a failing i know
accepting this ruefully i see
i dont care
i dont care if there was love or not
thats all right
im going to go to my room and close the door
i dont want to hear any more
paul exits wretchedly to his room
see how youve upset him
he was so merry and hale before you came home
how unhappy hes going to be alone in his room
hell play with his rifle i expect
that will cheer him up
i bought him a twenty two yesterday on the way home from hamburger heaven
and where is the good doctor
have you two feathered a love nest somewhere
hes in east st
louis with his mother visiting an aunt
last i heard his mother was going alone
hes afraid of you harold
he knew youd want to fight him
he doesnt know anything about fighting
he hates pain
and you a supposedly healthy woman do not detest him for his cowardice
it seems highly intelligent to me
what kind of a country has this become
the men wear beads and refuse to fight and the woman adore them
americas days of greatness are over
it has drunk the blue soup
an indian narcotic we were forced to drink
it put us in a haze a honey colored haze which was lavender around the edge
we laughed we sang we snoozed
when a bird called we answered back
every living thing was our brother or our sister we thought
looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long and we cried
we had a funeral that went on for five days for the cockroach
i sang oh promise me
can you imagine
where the hell did i ever learn the words to oh promise me
looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a b
all the time we were drinking more blue soup more blue soup
never stopped drinking blue soup
blue soup all the time
wed go out after food in that honey colored haze and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender
sounds quite beautiful
angered beautiful you say
it wasnt life it wasnt death it wasnt anything
anger still mounting beautiful
seven years gone snapping his fingers like that like that
seven years of silliness and random dreams
seven years of nothingness when there could have been so much
becoming dangerously physical seizing a battle ax action
give and take
challenge and response
he splits a coffee table with the ax
rushing in with his rifle at a high port arms mom
paul wilts instantly attempts to make his rifle inconspicuous harmless meaningless
thats a rifle you have
of course it is
is it loaded
open the bolt
a cartridge pops out
thats a cartridge if im not mistaken
gunpowder bullet cartridge case and fulminate of mercury percussion cap all set to go
i was cleaning it
pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamber where it belongs
gee whiz dad welcome to manhood you little sparrowfart
load that gun
bleatingly dad too late
its man to man now
protecting your mother from me are you
hes a child
with an iron penis three feet long
load it boy
youre begging him to kill you
if he thinks hes man enough
amazed by sudden insight thats really what you want
you become furious when people wont make you dead
im teaching my son to be a man
so he can kill you
you hate your own life that much
you beg for a hero to kill you
i plan to live one hundred years
no you dont
if thats the case whats to prevent my killing myself
honor i suppose
what a handsome word
wonderingly but its all balled up in your head with death
the highest honor is death
when you talk of these animals one by one you dont just talk of killing them
you honored them with death
harold it is not honor to be killed
if youve lived a good life fought well its still just death the absence of life no honor at all
its worse than the blue soup by far that nothingness
to you though its the honor that crowns them all
may i continue with the rearing of my son
to paul load that gun
paul shakes his head
then speak by god
can you fight with words
i dont want to fight you
tell me you dont like the way i treat your mother
tell me you wish id never come home
weakly its your house dad
throwing up his hands everybody simply evaporates
including the audience inviting it to share his indignation there are guest issues to be fought out here or to be argued at least
the enemy the champion of all who oppose me is in east st
louis with his mother and his aunt
i have so far done battle with a woman and a child and a violin
the old heroes are going to have to get used to this harold the new heroes who refuse to fight
theyre trying to save the planet
theres no time for battle no point to battle anymore
i feel mocked insulted with no sort of satisfaction in prospect
we dont have to fight with steel
i can fight with words
im not an inarticulate ape you know who grabs a rock for want of a vocabulary
call him up in east st
tell him to come here
emptily turning away no
he contemplates paul
and my son the only son of harold ryan hes going to grow up to be a vanisher too
i dont know
i hope he never hunts
i hope he never kills another human being
to paul quietly you hope this too
i dont know what i hope
but i dont think you care what i hope anyway
you dont know me
indicating penelope you dont know her either
i dont think you know anybody
you talk to everybody just the same
im talking to you gently now
but its going to get loud again
hes right harold
to you were simply pieces in a game this one labeled woman that one labeled son
there is no piece labeled enemy and you are confused
lion doorbell roars
paul goes to answer it
there wont be anybody out there
thats the new style nobody anywhere
paul aghast admits norbert woodly
woodly is high as a kite on his own adrenaline
aghast chokingly get out of here
its really that bad
he comes farther into the room bravely
you fool you fool
oh look at the poor crucified violin would you
it died for your sins
this little corpse is intended as a lesson
theres a certain amount of information there
lest we forget how cruel you are
moving to the telephone im going to call the police
woodly closes the door
penelope backs away from the phone drifts toward paul who still holds his rifle
this is man to man
its healer to killer
is that the same thing
what brought you back
the same hairy humorless old gods who move you from hither to yon
honor if you like
to penelope hes a champion after all
of the corpses and cripples you create for our instruction when all we can learn from them is this how cruel you are
this is suicide
to paul go get the police
theres going to be no bloodshed here
i know how hell fight the only way he can fight with words
to woodly am i correct
i can defeat him with anything from flavored toothpicks to siege howitzers
but he got it into his little head that he could come here and demolish harold ryan with words
what an hallucination
laughs oh dear dear dear dear
oh dearie me
you havent heard me yet
you intend to crack my eardrums with your voice
will i bleed from my every orifice
who will clean up this awful mess
well find out now wont we
no we wont
no matter how it begins it will end in death
because it always does
isnt that always how it ends harold in death
there has to be a threat of some sort nobility of some sort glamour of some sort sport of some sort
these elements are lacking
youre a filthy rotten bastard
pretending to be wounded oooooo
youre old so old
now whos being cruel
a living fossil
like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs
we do survive dont we
youre going to have to apologize of course for calling me a bastard
thats a matter of form not allowing you or anybody to call me a bastard
no rush about that
just remember to apologize sometime soon
penelope takes the rifle from paul
youre a son of a bitch
yes well uh thats another one of those statements which more or less automatically requires an apology
whenever you feel like it
its sort of like turning off an alarm clock thats ringing loudly
your apology turns off the alarm
leveling the gun im turning off the alarm
im turning off everything
the lady is armed
i want you to get out of here norbert
harold i want you to sit down in the chair and not lift a finger until norbert is gone
to woodly whoever has the gun you see gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do
its the american way
i mean it
then youd better fix your bayonet because there arent any bullets in the gun
to paul wheres the bullet
paul makes no move to help
help your mother find the bullet
to paul pointing to the floor there it is
give it to me
how do i load
to paul load it for her
paul shakily obeys
cock it too
give it to her
am i exceedingly dangerous now
the national safety council would be appalled
then listen to me
angrily youre both disgusting with your pride your pride
to woodly i hate you for coming here like a federal marshal in a western film
i loved you when you stayed away
but here you are now high noon in the superbowl
you fool you fool
everythings going to be beautiful
youre no better than the dumbest general in the pentagon
pause youre not going to beat harold
youre not going to beat anybody
youre not going to stay here either yammering and taunting until youre most gloriously killed
shes right norbert go home
i havent said all i have to say
i havent told you harold how comical i think you are
hit squarely absolutely unable to forgive comical
to harold sit down or ill shoot
harold goes over to her easily takes the gun away give me that goddamn thing
now get out of here or i might kill you
terrified youve killed women
seventeen of them eleven by accident
to paul you too
penelope and paul move toward the front door
norbert you come too
to harold let him go harold
let him go
of course he can go if hell just go down on his hands and knees for a moment and promise me that he does not find me comical in the
do it norbert
hands and knees you say
and terror if you dont mind
to penelope simply decisively unafraid goodbye
before she can protest any more goodbye
he bellies and bullies penelope and paul out the front door
get the police
no time to lose
he slams the door turns to woodly
youre in one hell of a jam
you realize that
im high as a kite
youre supposed to be happy when you die
call me comical again
youre a clown
youre a clown who kills but youre a clown
i love you
have a cigar
ignoring the cigar evolution has made you a clown with a cigar
simple butchers like you are obsolete
im to be left behind in primordial ooze
if youre at home in the ooze and nowhere else
this is going to become very physical
are you prepared for that
youre not such a creature of the ooze that youd hurt an unarmed man
im an honorable clown
in any event i will not beg for mercy
no quarter asked
taking a sword no quarter given
dont you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew
offering sword cut me open
ive struck my blow
ive poisoned you
pointing at woodly in horror lucretia borgia
looking around frantically something i drank or touched
understanding you refused a cigar
potassium cyanide in the humidor
treacherous lover of peace
i put a poisoned thought in your head
even now that poison is seeping into every lobe of your mind
its saying obsolete obsolete obsolete and clown clown clown
you have a very good mind or i wouldnt have come back
that mind is now asking itself cleverly and fairly is harold ryan really a clown
and the answer is yes
touching his forehead experimentally i i really must congratulate you
something is happening in there
you can never take yourself seriously again
look at all the creatures youve protected us from
did you shoot them on the elevator as they were on their way up here to eat us alive
blankly as though in a dream no
the magic root you gave me i had it analyzed
it was discovered by a harvard botanist in
he explored your famous jungle for five years armed with nothing but kindness a talent for languages and a pocketknife
blankly i see
you arent going to hurt me
you arent going to hurt anybody any more
any violent gesture will seem ridiculous to yourself
quietly don quixote
my violin is avenged
something seems to have happened to my self respect
and the hell with it
it was so tragically irrelevant so preposterously misinformed
the new hero is you
i hate crowds and i have no charisma youre too modest
but the new hero will be a man of science and of peace like me
hell disarm you of course
no more guns no more guns
was i ever of use
for when you began to kill for the fun of it you became the chief source of agony of mankind
harold picks up the rifle considers it offers it to woodly
finish the job
im utterly satisfied
youre making a mistake
obsolete old carnivores like me are most dangerous when wounded
youve wounded me
dont you see
we never quit fighting until were dead
youd be killing a friend
dont you know how much i like you
im going to shoot you now
my self respect is gone and my soldiers honor with it
it is now very easy for me to shoot an unarmed man
new dignity can be yours as a merciful man
you can change
like the saber toothed tiger
sickened oh god youre really going to kill me
it wont hurt as much as the sting of a bumblebee
heaven is very much like paradise they say
youll like it there
can i beg for mercy on my knees
if you want to be found that way
what is this thing that kills me
man as man was meant to be a vengeful ape who murders
he will soon be extinct
its time its time
ive enjoyed being man
he aims the rifle tentatively
goes down on his knees no
have it your way
wed both be better off dead now
harold begins to squeeze the trigger falters lowers the rifle
cant do it
he turns his back on woodly who stands shakily
thank you for my life
its trash now like mine
new lives begin
somewhere in this city
not here not here
tell penelope i loved her in my clownish way
tell him to be a healer by all means
what are you going to do
use the sanitary facilities if i may
leave the rifle here
ill put it in pauls room where it belongs
give me your word of honor that thats all youre going to do
for what its worth now harold ryan the clown gives his sacred word
harold exits into corridor
woodly looks after him helplessly apprehensively
von konigswald mildred and wanda june enter from the side stealthily
von konigswald pantomimes that his companions are to be quiet and to listen for something wonderful
all ghosts cup their hands to their ears
there is a shot offstage
von konigswald is delighted
mildred is sickened
wanda june is dazed
woodly collapses in grief
harold enters from the corridor shaking his head
von konigswald expresses disappointment
mildred covers her face
wanda june sucks her thumb
