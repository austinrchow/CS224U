uh i work at initech and i dont consider myself a pussy ok

im gonna find out the hard way that im not a pussy if they dont start treating us software people better
they dont understand
i could come up with a program that could rip that place off big time
cut to joanna a pretty waitress
cut back to the guys

an occupational hypnotherapist
anne wants me to go
she thinks it might help
yknow sometimes i just think i keep thinking that shes cheating on me
i know what you mean
what is that supposed to mean
why dont you just tell anne youre not into hypnosis and you want to play poker with us
ah i cant do that
she might get all pissed off at me
besides i think the guy might be able to help
he did help anne lose weight
peter shes anorexic

an occupational hypnotherapist isnt going to help you solve any of your problems
and speaking of problems whats this i hear about you having problems with your tps reports

its the staff meeting
were all screwed thats what
theyre gonna downsize initech
oh what are you talking about tom
how do you know that
theyre bringing in a consultant thats how i know
thats what this staff meeting is all about
thats what happened at initrode last year
you have an interview with a consultant and they bring in efficiency experts
youre interviewing for your own job
tom every week you say youre losing your job and youre still here
im going to be the first one theyre gonna lay off
just the thought of having to go to the state unemployment office and having to stand in line with those scumbags
scene michael and samirs cubicle
theyre sitting there worrying
you know there are people in this world who dont have to put up with all this shit
like that guy that invented the pet rock
you see thats what you have to do
you have to use your mind and come up with some really great idea like that and you never have to work again
i dont think the pet rock was really such a good idea
the guy made a million dollars
i had an idea like that once
what was it tom
well all right
it was a jump
to conclusions mat
you see it would be this mat that you would put on the floor and it would have different conclusions written on it that you could
that is the worse idea ive ever heard in my life tom
yes yes its horrible
i i gotta get outta here
ill see you guys later if i still have a job
he goes to his cubicle
our high school guidance counselor used to ask us what you would do if we had a million dollars and didnt have to work
and invariably whatever we would say that was supposed to be our careers
if you wanted to build cars then youre supposed to be an auto mechanic
so what did you say
i never had an answer
i guess thats why im working at initech
no youre working at initech because that question is bullshit to begin with
the printer is not working if that quiz worked there would be no janitors because no one would clean shit up if they had a million dollars
well i would invest half of it in
mutual funds and give the rest of it to my friend saheib in securities
samir the point of the exercise is that you could figure out what you want to do
reads the printers display pc load letter
what the fuck does that mean
he knocks off the paper tray
scene peters apartment
he enters tired and sits down on the couch
he then turns on the tv
lawrence cant you just pretend like we cant hear each other through the wall
im sorry man is anne over there or something
but if you just want to talk to me just come over
lawrence does so it takes him like ten seconds
check this out dude
he changes channels a bunch of times pepsi commercial a soap opera and another show

pocket the last few hours of the day
and turn off your answering machine you should be home free then
thats a really good idea
sits on the couch lawrence what would you do if you had a million dollars

swanson and two other patients

oh thats bad stuff
but is there any way that you you could just sock me out so theres no way that ill know im at work

i want you to do something for me peter
dims the lights i want you to try and relax
i want you to relax every muscle in your body from your toes to your fingertips

youre going to begin to feel your eyelids getting heavy as you slip deeper and deeper into a state of complete relaxation
the air of concerns to you is disappearing
deeper way down your concerns about your job melts away
way way down
now when i count backwards from three youll be in a state of complete relaxation
your worries cares and ambitions will be gone
and you will remain in that state until i snap my fingers

peter what is wrong with you
first you sit there while dr
swanson dies and you just walk out of the car and embarrass me in front of my friends
dont blame this on hypnosis either
thats total bull
peter hangs up but anne calls back
peter gets back into bed
another staff meeting
from now on you use the time sheets if you work on two or more job codes and you need the extra columns to fit it all in
otherwise use the old time sheets
how come he didnt show up this weekend
i i dont know
it would really really help us out
so uh any questions
peter enters and goes up to joanna at the counter
hi im peter
how can i help you
what are you doing for lunch today
well our specials are barbecued chicken its actually right over there on the board
points excuse me
she goes to take orders
look whos back

i was asking what you were doing for lunch
would you like to have lunch with me
oh are you serious
yeah i dont i dont think im supposed to do that
ill tell you what im gonna do
im gonna go next door and get a table and if youd like to join me no big deal
and if not thats cool too
he starts to walk away
uh when you say next door do you mean chilis or flingers
bob slydell and bob porter are interviewing tom
so what you do is you take the specifications from the customers and you bring them down to the software engineers
that thats right
well then i gotta ask then why cant the customers just take the specifications directly to the software people huh
well uh uh uh because uh engineers are not good at dealing with customers
you physically take the specs from the customer
well no my my secretary does that or or the fax
then you must physically bring them to the software people
yeah i mean sometimes
well what would you say
you do here
well look i already told you
i deal with the goddamn customers so the engineers dont have to
i have people skills
i am good at dealing with people
cant you understand that
what the hell is cut to inside
is that your real name
are you in any relation to the pop singer
its just a coincidence
i mean you must really love his music
he he hes pretty hes pretty good i guess
youre god damn right he is
so tell me
whats your favorite song of his
i i i dont know
i mean i guess i sorta like em all
the bobs laugh
i feel the exact same way but it must be hard for you i mean having the same name as him
i celebrate the guys entire catalogue
but anyway lets get down to business michael
you you know you can just call me mike
they stare at him
peter is saving a table and joanna enters
i wonder if they will let me wear this in here
i think it would be ok
would you like to sit down
he motions to a chair
does so wow
this place is really nice
yeah is it
oh my god compared to chotchkies
i like the uniforms better anyways
i like yours
makes a face peter looks at the buttons wearing on his suspender
one says were not in kansas anymore
the one underneath says poof
were not in kansas anymore
laughs its on your points oh
thats uh thats uh my pieces of flair
what are pieces of flair
thats where you know suspenders and buttons and all sorts of stuff
were uh were actually required to wear fifteen pieces of flair
quite stupid actually
do you get to pick them out yourself
although i didnt actually choose these
i uh i just grabbed fifteen buttons and uh i dont even know what they say
yknow i dont really care
i dont really like talking about my flair
so where do you work uh peter
and uh what do you do there peter
i sit in a cubicle and i update bank software for the switch
you see they wrote all this bank software and to save space they put instead of
so i go through these thousands of lines of code and uh it doesnt really matter
i uh i dont like my job
i dont think im gonna go anymore
youre just not gonna go
wont you get fired
i dont know
but i really dont like it so im not gonna go
no no not really
im just gonna stop going
when did you decide all that
about a week ago
so so youre gonna get another job
i dont think i d like another job
yknow i never really liked paying bill
i dont think ill do that either
i want to take you out for dinner and then i wanna go to my apartment and watch kung fu
did you ever watch kung fu
joanna gets a weird look on her face
i love kung fu
you should come over and watch kung fu tonight
can we order lunch first
scene miltons cubicle
he hears bill talking and eavesdrops
stapler off my desk
milton puts his swingline stapler somewhere else
the guys laugh
anyway sounds great bob
ill see you in a few
they walk off hey milton whats happening
uh im going to have to ask you to move your desk
now if you could get it to go as far back against that wall as possible that would be great
no no because i was i was that way well have some room for more boxes and things we need to put in here
uh sees the swingline oh there it is
let me just get that from ya
picks it up great
so if you could get to that as soon as possible that would be terrific
have a nice lunch milton
he walks off
ill set the building on fire
scene hallway at initech
peter enters in casual clothes
milton walks up to him
what the hells going on man
i thought you were going to come in here and start shooting
i just came to get my address book
im not gonna stay
ive got a number i dont wanna lose
peter youre in deep shit
you were supposed to come in on saturday
what were you doing
michael i did nothing
i did absolutely nothing and it was everything that i thought it could be
well i hope you have a better story than that for lumbergh
you know youre supposed to be having your interview right now with the consultants
he writes down joannas number
what has gotten into you
peter peter you gotta postpone it man
tell them you were sick
make something up
ah no way
i feel great
scene the interview room
the next paper looks like a peter gibbons
we were just talking about you
you must be peter gibbons
im bob slydell and this is my associate bob porter
why dont you grab a seat and join us for a minute
he does so
ysee what were trying to do here were just trying to get a feel for how people spend their day
so if you would would you just walk us through a typical day for you
well i generally come in at least fifteen minutes late
i use the side door that way lumbergh cant see me
uh and after that i just sorta space out for about an hour
i just stare at my desk but it looks like im working
i do that for probably another hour after lunch too
id probably say in a given week i probably do about fifteen minutes of real actual work
uh peter would you be a good sport and indulge us and tell us a little more
let me tell you something about tps reports
cut to later
peter is more relaxed
the thing is bob its not that im lazy
its just that i just dont care
dont dont care
its a problem of motivation all right
now if i work my ass off and initech ships a few extra units i dont see another dime
so wheres the motivation
and heres another thing bob
i have eight different bosses right now
i beg your pardon
so that means when i make a mistake i have eight different people coming by to tell me about it
thats my real motivation is not to be hassled
that and the fear of losing my job but yknow bob it will only make someone work hard enough not to get fired
bear with me for a minute
believe me this is hypocritical
but what if you were offered some kind of stock option and equity sharing program
i dont know
listen im gonna go
its been really nice talking to be of you guys
he shakes their hands
its all on this side of the table trust me
good luck with your layoffs
i hope your firings go really well
cut to the cubicles
peter walks past them and into the hall
hey peter whats happening
listen uh peter walks right past him
scene chotchkies joanna
would you come here for a moment please
i was late
i was having lunch
i need to talk about your flair
i have buttons on
i uh shows him well ok is minimum ok
now its up to you whether or not you want to just do the bare minimum
well like brian for example has pieces of flair
and a terrific smile
ok you want me to wear more
people can get a cheeseburger anywhere ok
they come to chotchkies for the atmosphere and the attitude
thats what the flairs about
its about fun
so more then
look we want you to express yourself ok
if you think the bare minimum is enough then ok
but some people choose to wear more and we encourage that ok
you do want to express yourself dont you
thats all i ask
scene conference room
dom and bill are talking to the two bobs
so theres three more people we can easily lose
theres tom smykowski
sounds good to me
heres a peculiar one
you know squirrely looking guy mumbles a lot
we cant find a record of him being a current employee here
i looked into it more deeply and i found what happened was he got layed off about five years ago and no one ever told him about it
but through a glitch in payroll he still gets a paycheck
i went ahead and fixed the glitch
so um milton has been let go
just a second there professor
we uh we fixed the glitch
so he wont be receiving a paycheck anymore
so itll just work itself out naturally
we always like to avoid confrontation whenever possible
the problem is solved from here on then
uh we should move on to a peter gibbons
i had a chance to meet this young man and boy does he have straight to upper management written all over him
ooh uh yeah
im going to have to go ahead and sort of disagree with you there
uh hes been real flaky lately and im not sure that hes the caliber person you want for upper management
hes been having some problems with his tps reports
ill handle this
we feel that the problem isnt with peter
its that you havent challenged him enough to get him really motivated
there it is
yeah im not sure about that now
all right bill
let me ask you this
how much time each week would you say you deal with these tps reports
scene peter parks in bills usual spot and goes into the building
he takes a drill and removes the metal door handle
cut to outside where bill has to park in the handicap spot
cut back inside
peter tears down the banner
cut to outside
bills porsche is being towed away
they only manage to pull off the bumper
cut to peter and joanna watching kung fu
theyre about to kiss
hey peter man
check out channel nine
its a breast exam
cut to peters cubicle
bill checks his watch because peters still not there
cut to a lake
lawrence peter and joanna are fishing
peter holds up a big fish
cut to initech
peter enters with an igloo cooler
he slaps him on the back
cut to peters cubicle
he puts the fish on his desk and starts to gut it
he throws its entrails on a stack of tps reports
cut to peter and joanna watching kung fu
cut to peter removing the screws in the cubicle wall
he pushes it over
it reveals a window and peter relaxes
scene peters cubicle now with only one wall
hes playing tetris as bill walks up
so peter whats happening
now are you going to go ahead and have those tps reports for us this afternoon
peter keeps playing uh yeah
so i guess we should probably go ahead and have a little talk hmm
not right now lumbergh
im im kinda busy
in fact im going to have to ask you to go ahead and just come back another time
i have a meeting with the bobs in a couple of minutes
uh i wasnt aware of a meeting with them
yeah they called me at home
that sounds good peter
uh and well go ahead and uh get this all fixed up for you later
scene miltons cubicle
hes organizing papers
whats going on
i i i i i didnt receive my paycheck this week
uh youre gonna have to talk to payroll about that
i i did and they and they said uh were gonna need to move your desk downstairs into storage b
uh we have some new people coming in and we need all the space we can get
i i i and if you could could go ahead and get a can of psticide and take care of the roach problem weve been having that would be great
he walks away
i believe you have my stapler
scene the meeting between peter and the two bobs
it looks like youve been missing a lot of work lately
i wouldnt say ive been missing it bob
thats terrific peter
i i im sure youve youve youve heard some of the rumors around the hallway about how were just going to do a little finger quotes housecleaning with some of
the software people
well bob i have heard that and you gotta do what you gotta do
well these people here
naga worker here anyway
the bobs laugh
were certainly gonna miss him
youre gonna layoff samir and michael
were gonna bring in some entry level graduates for us to work in singapore thats the usual deal
well its standard operating procedure
do they know about this yet
no of course not
we always find its better to fire people on a friday
its statistically shown that theres less chance of an incident if we do it at the end of the week
anyway peter what we would like to do is put you into a position where you would have as many as four people working right underneath you
this is a big promotion pete
so youre gonna fire samir and michael and give me more money
scene michael is messing with the printer
thats exactly what i need
just give it to me
come on you little fucker
thats what i need
lets do that
lets do exactly that you little fu peter walks up to him
well what are you doing tonight
scene peters place
michael samir and peter are there
there comes a place in a mans life and uh maybe that time for you is now when it doesnt hurt to think about the future
uh no offense there peter but think about yourself sport
youre the one whos been flaking out at work
whatever that religious experience or whatever the hell it was you better snap out of it or youre gonna get canned
i i i
listen that virus youre always talking about
the one that that could rip off the company for a bunch of money
what about it
well how does it work
its pretty brilliant
what it does is where theres a bank transaction and the interests are computed in the thousands a day in fractions of a cent which it usually rounds off
what this does is it takes those remainders and puts it into your account
this sounds familiar
they did this in superman iii
what a good movie
a bunch of hackers did this in the s and one of them got busted
well so they check for this now
no you see initechs so backed up with all the software were updating for the year theyd never notice
and even if they wanted to they could never check all that code
its numbers up their asses
so michael whats to keep you from doing this
its not worth the risk
i got a good job
what if you didnt have a good job
scene a bar
michael and peter are there
samir and i are the best programmers in that place
and you you havent even been showing up and you get to keep your job
actually im being promoted
yeah i know michael
its completely unfair
and i realized something today
its not about me and my dream of doing nothing
its about all of us together
i dont know what happened at that hypnotherapist the other day maybe it was just shock
its wearing off now but when i saw that fat man keel over and die michael i realized that we dont have a lot of time on this earth
we werent meant to spend it this way
human beings werent meant to sit in little cubicles starring at computer screens all day filling out useless forms and listening to eight different bosses drone on about mission statements
i told those fudge packers that i like michael boltons music
that is not right michael
for five years now youve worked your ass off at initech hoping for a promotion or some kind of profit sharing or something
five years of your mid s now gone
and youre gonna go in tomorrow and theyre gonna throw you out into the street
you know why
so bill lumberghs stock will go up a quarter of a point
michael lets make that stock go down
lets take enough money from that place that we never ever have to sit in a cubicle ever again
your software works right
of course it works
thats not the point
look even if it could work i dont know how to install it
i dont know the credit union software loan
but samir does
scene peters apartment
samirs there along with michael and peter
but thats not much money i thats the beauty of it
each withdrawal is a fraction of a cent
thats too small to notice
take a thousand withdrawals a day space it out over a few years thats a couple hundred thousand dollars
just like superman iii

scene peters place morning
joanna sees all the empty liquor bottles
hey what were you guys celebrating last night
um im not really at liberty to talk about it
i really cant
scene peters car
he and joanna are going to the barbecue
so when the subroutine compounds the interest right it uses all these extra decimals places that just get rounded off
so we just simplify the whole thing and we just round it down and drop the remainder into an account that we own
so youre stealing
you dont understand
its uh very complicated
its uh its its aggregate so im talking about fractions of a cent that uh over time they add up to a lot
so youre gonna make a lot of money right
thats not yours
well it it becomes ours
hows that not stealing
i dont think i dont think im explaining this very well
um this seven eleven right
if you take a penny from the tray from the crippled children
no thats the tray
im talking about the tray
the pennys for everybody
oh for everybody
yeah well those are whole pennies
im just talking about fractions of a penny here but we do it from a much bigger tray
a couple of million times
so whats wrong with that
it seems wrong
its not wrong
initech is wrong
initech is an evil corporation all right
chotchkies is wrong
doesnt it bother you that you have to get up in the morning and put on pieces of flair
yeah but im not about to go in and start taking money from the register
you know the nazis had pieces of flair but they made the jews wear them
look we dont i i we dont have to talk about this
lets just go to the barbecue all right

just remember if you hang in there long enough good things can happen
i mean look at me
scene the backyard
samir and michael are talking to rob

lumbergh fucked her

peter wakes up and breathes deeply
stan approaches joanna
we need to talk
do you know what this is about
my uh flair
or uh your lack thereof
im counting and i only see fifteen pieces
let me ask you a question joanna
what do you think of a person who only does the bare minimum
what do i think
let me tell you what i think stan
if you want me to wear thirty seven pieces of flair like your pretty boy brian over there then why dont you just make the minimum thirty seven pieces of
well i thought i remember you saying you wanted to express yourself

you said the thing was gonna take two years
you said the thing was supposed to work
well technically it did work
no it didnt
it did not work michael ok
i must have i must have put a decimal point in the wrong place or something
i always do that
i always mess up some mundane detail
what is this fairly mundane detail michael
ok quit getting pissed at me all right
this was all your idea asshole
lets try not to get pissed off at each other all right
well figure this thing out together ok
and the first thing we gotta do is we gotta close that account down before it gets any bigger
its bills st birthday
all the employees are singing the birthday song to him in a flat monotone
he blows out the candles and everyone claps

i really really appreciate it
a slice is handed to milton
milton dont be greedy

he does so
but this this it it its a little cake
everyone gets a piece and nina gets the last one
milton has to watch everyone enjoy their piece
scene peters apartment
theyre trying to figure out what to do
is is there a way to just give the money back
we just hand them a check with the exact amount theyre missing
i i think theyd figure that out
well we have to do something
may maybe we launder the money
thats a great idea
ok how do we do that
i dont know i dont know
i dont even know what it means
its something i think i think coke dealers do
do we know any coke dealers
my my cousins a cokehead
were in deep shit
we are in very very deep shit
scene miltons new office the basement
bill enters with a piece of cake
i wanted to see you because say you know what would be a great idea

thats really not my job and i havent received my for now why dont you get a flashlight and a can of pesticide and dom enters
we need you upstairs right away
some major glitch in the accounting

how is it that all these stupid neanderthal mafia guys can be so good at crime and smart guys like us can suck so badly at it
were new to it though
if we had more experience no
yknow what i think
i think were screwed

if were caught while laundering money were not going to go to white collar resort prison
no no no
were gonna go to federal reserve pound me in the ass prison
i dont want to go to any prison
