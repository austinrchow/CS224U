rising from a swampy bog the mud slides from view allowing it to see early morning mist hanging about the forest
creeping silently past trees gliding over small shrubs it moves onward through the woods until a mammoth oak rests directly in its path
the tree is uprooted by this unseen force and falls with a deafening crash
near by a stretch of highway curves along the base of a mountain
the road winds off into oblivion beyond other peaks
from behind view the rumble of an engine can be heard
it is a large logging truck headed south
moving away the truck becomes smaller until finally it disap pears in the distance
from where the truck emerged a dilapidated gold oldsmobile comes into view
inside five people can be seen
they are couples ashly and linda scott and shelly and cheryl ashlys sister
both scott and shelly wear michigan state t shirts and are students along with the others at that univer sity
scott is driving and shelly sits next to him up front
ashly linda and cheryl are in back
they listen to an old baby moses and the thrillers song on the radio and shelly is slapping the dash board as if it were a drum
singing with the music
ash where are we
ill tell ya in a second
now were still on seventy five just past the county border
once again the camera takes the point of view of the dark and brooding force which stops atop a forest ridge to peer downward
its view focuses upon the olds mobile speeding along the narrow highway below
ashly traces a route on the map with his finger
which would put us
which would put us
jesus christ just tell us already will ya
ashly zeroes in on the map with his finger
scott is growing impatient
suddenly the radio stops and the steering wheel jerks from scotts hand
the car screetches out of control into the opposite lane
a large oncoming tanker truck with its horn screaming races toward the car on a collision coarse
scotty watch out
the truck races closer
their steering wheel is locked
at the last possible instant scotts wheel again can be controlled and the car swerves sharply back into its own lane
the truck speeds harmlessly past them
damn it scott what the hell was that
you trying to kill us
dont yell at me its your lousy steering wheel
the damn thing jerked right out of my hand
i cant understand it
i just had this thing in for a tune up
radios dead too ace
and i just had em tune up the whole thing yesterday
well then take it back cause the damn thing dont work
only thing that works on the whole car is the lousy horn
scott honks the horn
several local men walking down the highway respond to the horn by waving
scott yells out the window at them
aw go to hell im not waving at ya
he looks in the rear view mirror
the men are still wav ing in the distance
scott turns back to drive
shelly turns around in the front seat and holds up a pint of scotch
well id like to make a toast
to scott who almost killed us
aw eat shit and die will ya
shelly and the others laugh
okay okay then to a wild week end in a wonderful cabin with good friends she glances at scott provided we live that long
shelly cooly drinks from the scotch and passes the bottle back to ashly and linda
ashly pours linda a drink in the bottle cap and keeps the bottle
they raise their drinks
ashly and linda with good friends
they toast drink and react to the strong liquor
ashly tries to hide his reaction to the scotch in front of linda since shelly had reacted so calmly
ashly passes the bottle to cheryl who stops him with a polite no thank you then back up front to scott
hey scotty whats this place like anyway
well the guy thats renting it says its an old place little run down but its right up in the mountains totally secluded
he takes a drink from the bottle best part is we get it so cheap
why are we getting it so cheap
i dont know might be in real bad shape
you mean nobodys seen this place yet
might not be too bad
actually it might be very nice
its probably a real pit
i cant believe that were renting a place for a week end that nobodys seen
mumbling to himself jesus christ not this again
turning to ashly you know mom and dad would never let us go up to a place like this if they knew which is exactly why they dont know
ill tell you who i am gonna call
the guys that fixed up this car
the car approaches an exit along the highway
ashly glances at the map again
hey i think this is where we get off
the car turns off the main highway and follows several back roads until it approaches a narrow dirt lane that winds upward along a twin set of mountains
scott glances up to the peaks
these mountains seem familiar
what do they remind you of
some thing majestic
yeah more like adventure
any adventure in particular
ashly and scott laugh out loud
linda laughs quietly and cheryl lets out an embarassed giggle to herself
teasing oooh youre gonna get it scotty when you least expect it youre gonna get it good
finally the car arrives at a wooden bridge extending over a great chasm
carefully the vehicle crosses
it is late afternoon when they eventually arrive at their destination
the small wooden cabin is surrounded by thick dark woods
scott shuts off the car but it contin ues to sputter and backfire
ashly reacts to his car
i sent em a check for the tune up
but im just not paying for it
this place is perfect
the woods come awfully close to the house dont they
so whats wrong with the woods they cant bite ya
its just a little claustrophobic thats all
well i think its beautiful
me too its gonna be a bomb week end
scott moves to the front door of the cabin where he finds a small ring of keys concealed on the shelf above the door
ashly unloads the car to the others
its supposed to be one of these on here
after trying several keys he is able to unlock the door
the interior of the cabin is completely dark
scott opens the door and stands silhouetted in the doorway for a moment then enters to find the light switch
the illumination reveals floors walls and ceilings made of cedar
there are two small bedrooms a kitchen and the main room which contains a stone fireplace set into the wall
an old grandfather clock stands silently in one corner partially hidden in the shadows
a door in the rear of the cabin leads to a small work shed containing a work bench and an assortment of tools upon the wall
located centrally in the main room is a trap door leading to the cellar
this catches scotts eye
hey this place has a dungeon
cheryl puts down a case of art supplies and moves over to scott by the trap door
he unlocks a chain securing the trap door with one of his keys and hands the ring to shelly
put these back will you
shelly leaves with the keys and scott tries to open the hatch but cannot
they nailed it shut
good i dont like cellars
probably just some garbage down there anyways
cheryl they dont nail garbage in cellars
i mean its not going to try and get out or anything
well whats down there
well could be any number of things
old baseball cards mushrooms dead bodies hey look at this
linda is standing in the corner next to the old grand father clock
she repositions a balance weight and it begins to tick
the others applaud and whistle
the cabin is seen from the outside
twilight has come
cheryl sits alone in the living room near the window
she is drawing sketches of the old clock
as she works the ticking stops unexpectedly
cheryl puts down her pencil and looks up to the clock
it stands silently in the cor ner with its hands frozen in position
there is a rust ling from the woods
cheryl looks out the window but can see only the trees
something is moving outside yet re mains hidden within the forest
a gust of wind fills the room
cheryl glances down at her hand
it turns a pale white and begins to shake and jerk about uncontrollably
she stares on incredulously as her hand guided by some unseen force picks up the pencil and begins to sketch a figure upon her pad
the wind gales through the open window but dies down slowly as her hand completes the drawing
whatever was at the edge of the woods has now retreated further into them
her hand loses the pale cast and is now under control once more
cheryl picks up her pad of paper
the likeness of a book with some form of ancient writing on its cover has been sketched
she looks to the woods which are now silent
a snapping of wood is heard from the cellar
cheryl quickly turns to the trap door still nailed shut in the floor
pos sibly just a mouse but she fixes her gaze upon it
another sound almost like faint breathing comes from the cellar
ashly and linda enter from the kitchen
ashly is drink ing a beer and moves over to cheryl
he stands between her and the trap door
whatre you drawing cheryl
he picks up the piece of paper
linda looks over his shoulder to glance at it
i dont know
is it a bible
no no its no bible
she glances again at the cellar knowing some thing is down there i dont know what it is
well this one of the clocks not bad
linda picks up the sketch and walks over to the clock with it a few steps away
she stands comparing it to the real thing with her back to cheryl and ashly
she is only a few inches from the trap door and cheryl wants to call out in warning when ashly kneels in front of her to speak secretly
in a whisper i got it right here
he taps something in his shirt pocket
cheryl is looking past him paying no attention
she watches only lindas feet waiting for whatever is in the cellar to grab them
linda looks at the drawing in comparison
cheryl this is really good
i like how you did the numbers in that wood ish style
ashly produces a small box from his shirt and opens it quickly to show cheryl
it contains a gold pendant on a necklace
linda takes a step closer to the clock
she is now standing almost upon the trap door
although nailed shut it opens slightly pulling the nails with it
ashly is pleased with her response
still in a whisper i knew youd like it
quickly he places it back in his shirt and touches his lips with a finger to indicate the secrecy of his sup rise
linda returns with the sketch and places it back on cheryls small drawing table
its really good cheryl
very close to the origional
in a relieved whisper yes very close
im gonna check dinner
linda returns to the kitchen and ashly turns to cheryl
you better get washed up
ill see ya in there
he winks then follows linda into the kitchen
cheryl again looks at the cellar
slowly from her point of view the camera moves in toward the trap door wait ing
a blender screams as it mixes up a drink in the kitchen
shelly shuts it off and carries it to the dining room
she joins the others who are now seated at the dinner table and serves the mixture
scott sits between linda and cheryl
he leans over to cheryl
in a whisper dead bodies in the cellar dead bodies in the cellar
will you stop it
scott leave her alone will ya
scott turns toward linda
will you relax im just kidding around
she can take a joke he stops talking as he hears the trickling of water
he turns to see cheryl finish pouring a glass of water in his lap
the others laugh
scott is silent for a moment then begins chuckling to himself
he turns to cheryl
jokingly ill get ya
with a napkin he blots the water from his pants
ill get ya for this cheryl
ashly stands with his drink and raises the glass
id like to make a toast for all here this evening
as a greek friend of mine once said nis hat nis fert dis ruben tu tar im
the laughter is stifled by a loud snap and cracking of wood heard from the main room
what the hell
all stand from the table and hurry to the main room
the nails that held down the trap door have been ripped out and although still in tact the hatch is wide open
they stand silently in front of it looking blank as to what could have done this
cheryl is slighly more nervous than the others
ashly is the first to speak
slowly what is this
whatever it is its still down there
i dont like cellars lets close it up
she does not want to deal with it its probably just some animal
ha ha ha ha ha thats the stupidest thing i ever heard in my life
scott locates a flashlight and peers into the hole
he traces the old wooden steps into darkness with his light
maybe it is just some animal
yeah probably right
its probably just some animal
cheryl why dont you make sure
he hands the flashlight to cheryl who quickly gives it back
scotty im not going down there
okay okay you cowards ill go
youre crazy if you go down there
why dont you wait until morning
look ill be all right
a kiss my brave hero
scott kisses shelly and with flashlight in hand he descends the narrow steps into the cellars blackness
i your virgin queen eagerly await the precious moment when you will ascend
ha ha ha ha ha he disappears below the floor
shelly cheryl linda and ashly wait above
calling down hey scott see any thing
there is no answer
hes just kidding around
there is silence
no sounds come from the cellar
linda get me a flashlight
thats the only one we brought up
ashly spots a lantern on the fireplace mantle
then get that lantern
linda brings it over
ashly opens the kerosene valve lights the wick and descends into the basement
down below ashly moves quietly past the old stone walls and wooden beams which support the main floor above
in front of him stands an old door which leads to another section of the cellar
cautiously he moves toward it
before he can touch it the door swings open slowly with a moan
ashly moves through the doorway and deeper into the cellar
condensation from water pipes above turn the cellar into an echo chamber as drips fall into shallow pools on the dirt floor below
as ashly scans with his light he spots a shadow move out the corner of his eye
ashly breaks into a cold sweat as he moves away from the area where the shadow passed
he backs sqarely into a pair of arms which grab him
it is only scott behind him
what the hell are you doing down here jerkin off
how come you didnt answer me
just now i mean upstairs
i didnt hear you
oh well did you find anything
scott sweeps his light to another corner and reveals several items atop a small table
beneath a dusty cloth he finds a book which appears to be covered in some sort of animal hide with an ancient form of writing on the cover
along with this book scott and ashly uncover a reel to reel tape recorder an ancient dagger and other parapanalia including a box of rifle shells
it is evening as darkness surrounds the small cabin
the group sits huddled around the fireplace talking quietly about school
the same bottle of scotch is passed around
ashly is rewinding the tape recorder and once this is done he turns it on
the voice of an old man is heard
ashly turns to the others who are talking
shhh listen to this
my name is julian knowby
i am a pro fessor of ancient egyptian mythology in dextin universitys ancient history department
this is the tape i found downstairs
i am recording this entry from a small cabin in the south ern mountains of tennessee
here i am staying with my wife for a few weeks so that i may continue my research un disturbed
since may a group of assoc iate professors and myself have been excavating the ruins of can dar
i believe i have made an important find in that area and thus the reason for this log
with it i can keep an ac curate record of translations from my latest find the first of six the others still lost volumes of ancient sumarian burial practices and
basically it is a book of dos and donts dealing with the deceased en titled naturan demanto roughly trans lated book of the dead
it is bound in human flesh and inked with blood of the deceased
jeez id hate to find out what they used for pens
this particular volume deals with demons and demon resurrect ion
these are of the katardi family meaning those forces believed to inhab it the jungles and woods of mans do main
the first few pages that i have translated warn that these demons are dangerous everpresent and exist primarily through this book
as legend has it only the sacred high priests of the can dar tribe could posess these books for they alone could properly control the resurrected de mons
it is only through the act of reciting the resurrection passage that these demons would be able to posess the living
for many years it was thought that this legend cheryl turns off the machine at this point
hey whatd you do that for
it was just getting good
i just dont want to hear any more thats all
singing cheryls scared cheryls scared
scott leave her alone will ya
he moves to the tape recorder and fast forewards it for a bit then stops
shes acting like a baby its no big deal
he turns the machine on
the passage continues
tantir ah mis trobeen ha zar ta as the tape plays all natural sounds from the forest die out and the autumn colors in the trees fade to a gloomy
tantir man ov mis hazen sober
all eyes except cheryls turn to the window
outside clouds roll in from the east thunder booms in the distance and as the wind picks up it begins to rain
a section of ground deep within the woods begins to crack and opens
smoke seeps out from within as if some evil force was now being unleashed
in a whisper shut it off
the winds howl and blackbirds fly from their nests screaming
louder now shut it off
ashly hearing her for the first time turns from the window to cheryl
she is overwhealmed with fear
a bolt of lightning strikes very near and its thunder crash is deafening
cheryl can no longer control herself
she screams and covers her ears
shut it offffff
the window shatters when a branch from a nearby tree tears through it
ashly runs to the tape recorder and turns it off
cheryl is crying now and runs to her room
ashly turns to scott
scott you knew not to play it i mean
i mean you knew it was upset ting her
you just dont know when youre carrying something too far
to shelly cmon
back to ashly big deal its just a joke shit
scott and shelly head for their bedroom
scott mumbles to himself along the way
youd think shes three years old or something
scott slams the door behind him
he moves to the broken window and reaches through it to close the outside shutters
hes really been bothering you hasnt he
ashly walks to a chair near the other window
its not scott
its just that ever since we came up here things have been a little too tense
he sits all these crazy things going on
and look at that window were gonna have to pay for that window now
itll be better tomorrow
thingsll smooth out youll see
i hope so
he looks at linda lovingly for a long moment
whatya say we stay up for a while and listen to the storm
lemme check on cheryl
ill be right back
from across the room she is seen opening cheryls door a crack
linda asks if she is all right and gets a muffled reply
in the foreground ashly removes the small box he showed to cheryl earlier and places it in his hand
he glances behind to linda
she closes cheryls door and walks back to find ashly sound asleep with the box in his hand
she reaches for the box and ashly opens his eyes to watch
linda looks at him but his eyes are closed again in time to still appear fast asleep
linda turns her attention back to the box
ashly watches again wide eyed as she removes it from his hand
quickly linda turns to him but as expected ashly is sleeping like a baby
she begins to turn back toward the box and ashly opens his eyes but linda turns back again in time to catch him with his eyes wide open
laughing stealing from the blind eh
its for you
linda begins to open the box
it better be good
the gold necklace is revealed inside
oh ash its beautiful
linda kisses ashly
he removes the necklace from the box and holds it around her neck
fastening it around her neck i was going to give it to you before we left but things got so hectic this is the first chance ive had
do you like it
linda moves to a mirror
i really love it
she turns to ashly ill never take it off
lightning strikes as something in the woods examines the small cottage
through the outside window ashly and linda can be seen embracing
this force watching them moves around the house to another window
the silhouette of scott and shelly undressing can be seen
the force continues around and arrives at cheryls window
inside she brushes her hair in front of the mirror for a moment then sets down her brush and moves to the window
she stops to uncrumple the sketch drawn earlier looks at it then out to the dark woods
cheryl can faintly hear some kind of sound
it is the same sound she had heard earlier from the cellar
a noise almost like that of something breathing
the evil entity rounds the corner of the cabin as cheryl walks through the rooms to the front door
she can be seen stepping out the door
it closes behind her
wind shaking the tree branches sends dead leaves fluttering about
calling to the woods is anybody out there
there is no answer
cheryl steps away from the cottage toward the woods
the breeze animates her nightgown and it too seems alive
i know someones out there
i heard you
i heard you in the cellar
suddenly cheryl becomes chilled
she folds her arms around herself and stands at the woods edge listening
there is only darkness and sounds of the evening wind blowing through the trees
cheryl steps into the forest a few feet then stops
a cry deep within the woods can be heard
whispering in the distance grows somewhat louder and a soft wail is heard like that of something long since dead dredged up to roam the earth again
cheryl is about to turn back toward the cabin when a rustling comes from a group of trees about twenty yards behind her
several yards to her left a twig snaps suddenly
she turns but there is silence again
the winds die down leaving a deathly stillness throughout the woods
then all at once the entire forest becomes alive in a flurry of chaotic noises and movement
snake like vines wrap around her ankles and slither up her legs
tree branches near by begin to claw and rake at her
the force is now moving through the woods toward her
cheryl is able to break the vines and run toward the cabin
she emerges from the woods and into the clearing
the force is still following
cheryl reaches the cabin door but it is locked
she begins pounding upon the door
help help let me in
open the door
the evil entity now emerges from the woods
cheryl spots the small key ring above the door where shelly had returned them earlier
one by one she fran tically jams one key after another into the lock but still cannot find the right one
the force comes closer with each key
please someone please
help me help meeeee
the evil entity is almost upon her but her actions are so frantic that the ring falls to the ground
she bends down to pick them up but a hand grabs her arm
it is scott who has opened the door from the inside
she pushes him in the door and slams it tightly
what the hell happ in hysterics it
it tried to kill me
i i heard a noise and
and i ran and the trees
what are you he is cut off by ashly approaching with the others
cheryl whats wrong with you
did something in the woods do this to you
no no no
the woods themselves the trees theyre alive
she hugs ashly tightly and cries in hysterical sobs
ash why dont i take her into the bedroom so she can lie down a little cutting her off im not lying down
im not staying here
were leaving this place were leaving this place right now
wait a minute im sure as hell not going anywhere
cheryl cheryl theres nothing out there
trees do not attack people
ashly will you drive me into town or not
looking at his watch right now
he realizes how desperate she is sure sure ill drive you into town
but if youll just listen to what youre saying you i dont care how it sounds
i want to leave this minute
you can bring back my things when you go
okay if you dont want to stay i cant make you
linda puts a coat around cheryl as ashly helps her to the door
ashly and cheryl move to the car
ashly helps cheryl in then then gets in the drivers side
ill stay some place in town tonight
ashly tries to start the car
there is no response
cheryl becomes somewhat worried
ashly tries again
the car will not turn over
a look of dread comes across cheryls face
scott and the others join the two outside
its not gonna start
ashly again tries the engine
i know its not gonna start
its not gonna let us leave
ashly keys the engine and it turns over this time start ing up with a roar
ashly worried by cheryls condition glances over to her
confused and upset cheryl turns away from ashly and looks out her window
they drive off into the night through the wooded mountains toward town
ashly glances at cheryl who is studying the forest in tensely for any sign of movement
the concern for his sister is made obvious by the expression on his face
their car approaches the narrow bridge area and slows down
why are you slowing down
ashly brings the car to a halt
what is this
ashlys gaze is fixed directly ahead and his mouth opens slowly
he flips on the high beams which stab through the evening mist
the bridge over the chasm has been torn away
cheryl is silent as ashly walks to the ravines edge to examine any remains
mumbling to herself no no no no no
its not going to let us leave its not going to let us go
its not gonna let us gooooo
an axe is raised into the air then brought down smash ing upon a log splitting it in two
scott is chopping wood outside the cabin
behind him through a window cheryl sits with a cup of tea in her hand watching him
scott sets his axe down gathers the wood and moves away
cheryl shifts her gaze from scott to the woods beyond
the camera moves in toward cheryl then past her to shelly and linda who can be seen playing cards on the floor
ashly is seated near the fireplace with the tape recorder in front of him
he plugs an earphone in so only he can hear it
scott enters the cabin and passes in front of ashly to drop his wood to one side of the fireplace
he throws a log in and heads back outside
from inside linda speaks
cheryl wanna play some cards
turning with a smile uh uh
cheryl turns to face the window again
hey tomorrow morning well find some way around that cliff into town okay
outside the window scott chops more wood for the nights fire
ashly turns on the tape recorder to listen with the ear plug
suzanne came after me and almost murdered me
my own wife
at first i thought it was a mental or physical disorder because of what had happened to her eyes but i was only fooling myself
i knew what it was
outside the window scott continues to chop and gather wood
shelly still engaged in cards with linda holds up one in particular
okay guess this card
how am i going to know what card that is
guess im going to see if youre psychic
the card is a two of clubs
is it a queen
hey ash i guessed the card right
indifferently truly amazing linda
he is listening intently to the log as it continues
three days have passed since that thing has been down there
i was hop ing to weaken it without food or water
finally in desperation i dragged her out to the shed and dismembered her so that what ever it was could not get up again
cheryl did you see that
cheryl remains with her back to them staring out the window
try this one
she removes a nine of clubs from the deck and holds it up
okay lemme think uh
she puts her hands to her head in a curved funnel form ation as if to direct her thoughts to the card
um its a seven
oh my god what suit
diamonds no wait
i mean hearts
thats right seven of hearts
hey ash did you see that
i guessed two cards in a row
still not paying attention how do you do it linda
he is concentrating on the tape
this is when i saw the dark figures moving about in the woods
i should have never tampered with the book of the dead
i now know that what ever it is i have resurrected through this book is coming for me
you know i always thought i had some sort of extra sense
you know like e
p or something
whats this one
she holds up the queen of spades
i dont believe it
still looking outside queen of spades
shelly looks at her card then back to cheryl
she holds up another card
four of hearts
the card is a four of hearts
shelly bites her lip in fear and reaches for another card
ashly and linda listen in silence
eight of spades
shelly picks up the card
cheryl is correct again
two of spades jack of diamonds jack of clubs faster and faster she calls them off
even before shelly can flip them to keep up
suddenly cheryl turns toward the group
her eyes are bone white
shellys deck of cards slip from her hand and scatter across the floor
cheryls body is hoisted up to its feet and jerked about like a white eyed marionette
she speaks in a voice un like her own
why have you disturbed our sleep awakened us from our ancient slum ber
you will die
like the others before you
we will take you one by one
all of you ha ha ha ha ha she screams in a low gruff voice and collapses to the floor
oh my god shelly get scott in here
shelly does not respond
she exits through the front door
linda moves to cheryl and lifts her head gently
cheryl appears unconcious but behind her she reaches for a pen
did you see her eyes
whats wrong with her
ashly begins to speak when scott and shelly enter
what happened to her
cheryls hand clutches the pen tightly
look at her eyes
scotts hand reaches for cheryls eyes to inspect them but they blink open
the pen in her hand races upward then slashes down ripping into lindas achilles tendon
linda screams fiercely and with a blur the bloodied pen is raised again
ashly grabs cheryls arm stopping her but with a powerful swipe she swings her remaining arm at linda who is sent sprawling across the cabin floor
cheryl then clutches ashly and almost lifting him sends his body reeling across the room into a book case which topples over trapping him beneath its weight
shelly stands screaming as cheryl now advances toward ashlys face with the bloody pen
he struggles to pull himself out but cannot
cheryl is almost upon him when scott grabs her from behind
effortlessly she tosses him off and moves toward ashly again
scott climbs to his feet and grabs the axe
cheryl raises the pen above ashlys face and scott gives her a sharp jab in the jaw with the wooden handle
cheryl stumbles past linda and falls backwards head first into the cellar
she begins to climb out but scott slams the trap door shut upon her hand
it wont close
cheryl starts to push the trap door open from below
scott climbs on top and is almost thrown off until he viciuosly rams the butt of his axe down upon her protruding hand
demented screams and moans are heard from below as cheryls hand is finally pulled back and scott manages to secure the chain across the hatch
later that evening linda is seen in her bed sleeping
ashly covers her with a blanket kisses her and walks to the door closing it quietly behind him
ashly joins scott and shelly who sit near the fire in the main room
from the cellar strange moans sobs and laughter emerge then horrible rasping sounds from cheryls breathing
through the next sequence of dialogue her breathing becomes louder then somewhat quiet
shell be okay ash she just took a bad bump
scott and shelly listen to the strange noises from below as ashly looks out the window to the woods beyond
weve still got a few hours before morning
i dont know if i can wait that long
you have to
we all have to
then once its light out well try to find a way to get around that chasm
covering her ears why does she keep making those horrible noises
i dont know
and what about her eyes
ashly and scott are quiet
what about her eyes
desperately for gods sake what happened to her eyes
cheryl patiently sits in the cellars darkness with a streak of light across her eyes from the crack in the trap door
her head is slightly tilted as she watches and listens to what is said above
from her point of view we hear scott speak to shelly
everythings gonna be all right
cheryls lips part slightly and a thick blackish yellow liquid drools out between her teeth
outside the forest is very dark
the unseen force moves from the wooded area pushing over small trees and shrubs as it advances
the cottage comes into view and the evil entity glides up to it
the figure of a girl in the cabin window can be seen looking out
the force stops and moves behind a bush
inside shelly is studying the woods
i think theres some thing out there
scott joins her at the window and looks out
from within the woods this force watches scott peer out but he can see nothing
through the window he says some thing to reassure shelly and moves away
inside scott can be heard in mid sentence
is to get some rest
ash and i can stay up with cheryl
everythings gonna be okay
come morning youll see
shelly heads to her bedroom
scott walks back to the fireplace and sits
he slices twigs from a branch with the sumarian dagger and tosses them into the fire
ashly glances at the book of the dead then to the old clock
it stands silent
again the evil entity watches from outside
it sees shelly leave one room and turn the lights on in another
she begins to undress near the window
the force now moves from behind its cover and rushes at tremendous speed to shelly who is looking out her bedroom window
she sees it and sheer terror covers her face as a scream stifles itself in her throat but it is too late
a noise is heard from shellys bedroom
scott drops the small stick he was whittling and looks up
he places the dagger on the floor and walks toward shellys room
shelly are you okay
she does not answer
scott approaches her door and turns to ashly
keep an eye on cheryl for a minute
scott enters the darkness of her room and sees nothing amidst the shadows
he looks over to her window
it is open and wind blows upon the curtains
scott steps into shellys bathroom and sees that the shower curtain is drawn
cautiously he moves up to it
he pulls the curtain back to reveal an empty tub
scott turns back to the bedroom when shelly steps into the doorway posessed
with a scream she latches upon scott
her eyes have gone bone white and she claws at scotts face and clothes with her nails
screaming scott stumbles through her bedroom with shelly still upon him biting at his throat
they stagger into the main room where scott manages to knock shelly off himself and into the fireplace
she remains motionless as her head smolders upon the hot coals
scott rushes to her grabs an arm and pulls her out
shellys face and hair on one side of her head are seared and blackened
she blinks her eyes open turns her charred head to scott and speaks in a rasp
i dont know what i would have done if i had remained on the hot coals burning my pretty flesh
you have pretty skin give it to us
cackling shelly clutches scotts neck and begins throttl ing the life out of him with a vice like grip
he tries to break the hold but cannot
ashly also tries but with a backhand blow shelly knocks him into a cabinet smash ing it to bits
a garbled cry for help escapes from scotts frothing mouth
shelly reaches down picks up the sumarian dagger and holding scott by his throat with one hand she raises the dagger with the other
ashly slightly injured crawls to his feet
scott grabs her raised arm and although choking swings his camping knife from its side sheath and slices deep into shellys raised wrist almost severing it
a murky black ooze pumps from the wound
she emits an ear splitting howl and tightens her grip on scotts throat
he drops the hunting knife
ashly watches terrified unable to move as shelly raises her dangling hand still clutching the dagger to her mouth and bites it off
the useless part falls to the floor with the dagger still firmly in its fist
scott now almost dead grabs her severed hand clutching the dagger and in a last attempt swings it around ramming the blade into her spine
shelly screetches along with cheryl in the cellar the old grandfather clock gongs and lightning strikes all at the same instant
shelly reaches around with her remaining arm to clutch at the severed hand and knife protruding from her own back
a thick black ooze pours from the wound as she bends backward screaming
ashly stands in horror clutching the axe unable to move
black ooze runs from shellys mouth as her body writhes about spasmatically upon the floor
gradually the move ments cease and she is dead
as scott slowly stands to his feet shellys arm grabs his leg
some force reanimates her even though the body is dead
shellys body is hoisted up jerking about to its feet and laughing madly
scott screams this as he backs toward ashly who stands with the axe paralyzed
gurgling black ooze shelly advances toward them with one remaining arm
scott grabs the axe from ashly pushes him away and slams it into her
lightning flashes thunder booms and cheryl screams from the cellar
scott brings his axe down again and again in a frenzy
then after the final chop there is silence
shellys body remains on the floor for quite some time until ashly can cope with the fact that she is dead and something must be done
what is uh
what are we gonna do
cant bury shelly
shes a friend of ours isnt she
ash shes dead
ashly moves away from scott
were gonna bury her now
ashly bites his lip and looks about blankly
finally the body is dragged outside and buried near the work shed
harsh floodlights from the house make the task look very stark and barren
scott and ashly return inside
ashly heads to lindas room to check in on her
he peers in to see linda sleeping peacefully
ashly quietly returns to the main room
scott is load ing new batteries into a flashlight
i saw an old hiking trail when we were driving up here
now i dont know if it goes all the way around that gorge or if its even still in tact
or if its even still in tact
but uh i guess ill find out
take good care of linda
do you have everything
putting on a small back pack yeah all set
im sorry about falling apart like that when dont bother really
he steps out the door
if i find a way out of here ill mark it and then come back
then if im not back here in a few hours
if for some reason
well if i dont come back grab linda leg and all and just get her the hell out of here
they shake hands
youre a good man
good im the best
ashly smiles a good bye to scott and watches him move off into the night
he lingers for a moment by shellys grave then slowly disappears into the woods
ashly closes the door and turns back to the main room
he sees cheryls eyes through the crack in the cellar
she has been watching all of this through a space be tween the trap door and floor
ashly walks past her to lindas room
he opens the door and a crack of light falls across her
linda wakes up
its me linda
ash i had a bad dream about linda
you did baby
shes all right isnt she
is shelly okay too ash
ashly can no longer hide his fear and anxiety
he speaks in a whisper so as not to let his voice quiver
shes sleeping thats all
ash i love you
she turns over get some rest
ashly closes the door behind him and the fear from a few hours ago engulfs him once more
ashly moves into the main room and stops dead in his tracks when a voice in the cellar speaks
you lied to her
you lied to linda
shellys not sleeping
dont you know the difference
you killed her
you and scott cut her up with the axe
shes dead ha ha ha ha ha ha ashly picks up the axe and slams it down upon the trap door
cheryl is silent from below for a moment then the hatch opens an inch or so
the length of the chain securing it cheyls white eyes can be seen again
ha ha ha ha ha ha ashly takes the axe and steps outside
he begins to chop wood taking out his emotions upon the logs with each blow
shellys blood can still be seen on the blade of the axe
from her dungeon cheryl watches ashly chop wood in the window
the shadow of his axe rising then striking is seen over her white eyes
exhausted ashly puts down the axe
he looks off into the woods but there is no sign of scott
he returns to the cabin
cheryl begins her taunting again
soon all of you will be like me and then who will lock you in the cellar
ha ha ha ha ha cheryl begins to violently ram her fists against the trap door
ashly walks by her to lindas room
she is still asleep
quietly so as not to wake her ashly pulls back her blanket exposing the bandaged leg
he re moves the wrappings and looks at the wound
as he does this it infects with a blackened coloration at an in credible speed
ashly looks up to see if linda is still sleeping and sees that she has been watching him with white eyes and an evil grimace upon her face
she lets out a low growl
ashly jolts backwards out of her room to escape through the front door
he steps outside and stops to look back in
he can see the main room but finds it difficult to see in lindas room being lost in the shadows
something ragged and bloody grabs him
it is scotts mutilated body ripped and torn to shreds
he is still alive
ashly looks behind him through the door to lindas room
he can barely make out linda who sits on the bed watching him with glaring white eyes
ashly helps scott to the couch so he can sit
scott is in agony and can barely speak
ash i think im dying
jesus i cant feel my legs
uh scotty youre gonna be okay
youre gonna be just fine youll see
he throws another log on the fire
he looks off into lindas bedroom again but she is gone
she is now sitting in the corner of the main room where ashly is watching him
scott begins to cough with hor rible rasping sounds
its its not gonna let us leave
cheryl was right
were all gonna die here
were not gonna die
all gonna die
all of us
ashly grabs scott and shakes him violently
were not gonna die
were not gonna die
were getting out of here
now listen to me is there a way around the chasm
scott passes out
ashly slaps scott
he stirs awake and mumbles
i dont want to die
so lonely to die like this
youre not gonna leave me are you
are you ash
imitating scott i dont want to die
so lonely to die like this
youre not gonna leave me are you
are you ash
ha ha ha ha ha scott is there some way around the chasm
ash im scared i
i cant feel my legs
scott listen to me please for gods sake
is there a way around the chasm
one way the trail
but the trees they know
dont you see theyre alive
theyre ali ahhhhhhh
his sentence is cut short as he cries out in sharp pain
blood dribbles from his nostrils and he doubles over grabbing his stomach
linda begins to laugh
ashly looks to her or rather what posesses her with hatred
she continues to laugh
cheryl in the cellar joins in the laughter
ashly walks to linda and slaps her but she continues
he grabs a hunting rifle from a rack on the wall loads it with shells flips off the safety and places the barrels against lindas head
god forgive me linda
the laughter stops and her eyes return to normal
it is linda again
ashly puts down the rifle
ash oh ash help me
she hugs him tightly
dont let them take me away again please please please
crying and holding her tightly i wont i wont i promise
cheryls voice is heard from the blackness of the cellar
ashly help me
let me out of here
im all right now
ashly releases linda and moves cautiously to the cellar
linda remains behind nervously fumbling with her necklace
im all right now ashly
im all right
come unlock this chain and let me out
there is no reply from the cellar
ashly looks through the crack but sees only darkness
he reaches for the chain and begins to unlock it but sensing something wrong he stops
he puts his ear to the floor listening for the slight est sound
cheryls arms rip through the floor boards and grab ashlys head
he breaks away and her hand reaches for the chain but cannot quite grasp it
slowly it withdraws beneath the floor
a little too sweet ash what are you doing
this is your sister cheryl
dont you recognize me
her voice drifts off and the evil leughter resumes from the celler
crying and yelling to the cellar you bastards
why are you doing this
there is silence for a moment
laughter from behind him begins again
it is linda
her eyes are white once more and she laughs at ashly
with newly found courage ashly angrily grabs linda by the legs and drags her outside
its useless useless useless
in time well come for him then you ha ha ha ha ha ashly leaves her in the woods and runs back to the cabin closing the door behind him
scott is coughing again
ash ash please
i dont want to die but
but i cant stand this pain
it hurts ash
gimme something to put me out
scott i cant
i i know its bad
but i cant be alone now i cant
id lose my mind
please ash please
youll get better youll see
lindas laughter is faintly heard outside
ashly moves to the window and pulls back the curtain
linda is no longer in the woods but sitting at the edge of the clear ing watching ashly with her glowing white eyes
yeah tomorrow soon youll be better and well both get out of here tomorrow
there is no tomorrow
you youve got to kill her and cut cut her up your sister too
no that was only with shelly
you had to with shelly
you linda loves me
youre delirious i
ill get you some water
ashly places a glass to scotts lips
now now the sun will be up in an hour or so and well get out of here together
you me linda shelly n no not shelly she well all go home together
wouldnt you like to be going home
youd like that id bet wouldnt ya
there is no answer from scott
the water runs out of his mouth
scott is dead
lindas laughter is heard again
ashly walks to the window and pulls back the curtain
there is nothing there
he turns and she is there
with the sumarian dagger linda rips into ashlys shirt cutting his arm
he screams and watches in horror as she runs her tongue over the dagger licking the blood from it
she turns her attention toward ashly again but he grabs her and they struggle
linda backs ashly up against scott knocking his body to the floor
cheryls gnarled arm reaches up through the broken floor boards and grabs at ashlys foot
he manages to turn lindas arm so the knife is behind her back
forcefully ashly pushes her over the body of scott and she falls back ward upon the dagger impaling herself upon it
the blade tears into her back and rips through her stomach
lightning flashes thunder roars and linda screams in a deep growl once then all is quiet
ashly drags lindas corpse past the crumpled body of scott past cheryl who watches all of this from below through the back door and out to the work shed
he lifts her up onto the work bench and secures her body to it with a number of chains which hang from nails along the wall
he rips down a tarp hanging on the wall to reveal a chain saw
he starts it up and moves toward her
buzzing madly the saw is lowered to a position several inches above lindas neck
ashly looks into lindas face
her eyes have gone back to blue
he turns off the saw
in a whisper linda
he drops the saw and breaks down crying over lindas body
an evening mist drifts out of the woods and cloaks the shed as ashly carries lindas body outside for burial
he lays the body upon the ground and picks up a shovel
harsh floodlights from the corners of the cabin create strange shadows on the ground as ashly digs lindas grave
she lies on her back during the digging
one of her eyes opens
it is white
ashly drops the shovel and looks at her
she appears to be dead
inside the cabin cheryl begins slamming her fists against the trap door in the cellar again
she wants out
the screws holding the hatch in place begin to loosen
ashly places lindas corpse in the grave oblivious to cheryls pounding
he begins to cover her with dirt
cheryl has ripped out all but one screw which holds the trap door in tact
ashly glances to the grave and sees lindas necklace on top of the dirt mound
he reaches down to pick it up when lindas hand shoots up from beneath the grave and grabs him
she pulls herself up out of the grave scream ing and clutches ashlys leg with a black and bloodied hand
he twists around trying to free himself but she will not let go
by now linda is almost completely out of the grave
with her fingernails she rips into ashlys leg tearing his skin
screaming he picks up a large log nearby and swings it roundhouse into her face again and again breaking the wood into smaller bits
she grabs the log with him clinging to the other end lifts him up and throws ashly log and all away from her
ashly hits the ground with considerable force and for the first time begins to comprehend the power of this thing he is dealing with
thick black ooze pours from lindas nose and mouth as she turns toward ashly sprawled on the ground
his hand gropes for the handle of the spade
linda advances toward him laughing
linda please if you can still hear me
his fingers tighten on the wooden handle
with a scream she lunges toward him
from the ground ashly swings the spade upward lopping off her head
the head falls into the mud but the body falls upon him grabbing and jerk ing about spasmatically
thick black ooze pumps from her neck and ashly manages to pull himself out from underneath the body
he backs away in disgust and falls
he picks himself up again and sees lindas necklace upon the ground
ashly stashes it in his pocket and staggers back to the cabin
inside he looks to the main room beyond scotts body
it is a moan from deep inside him
the trap door is open and cheryl is gone
ashly walks over and kicks it shut
a slight breeze sweeps through the front door causing shellys bedroom door to creak open
ashly picks up the rifle again and cautiously moves to the door
the room is dark and the closet door bangs back and forth because of the breeze
ashly moves toward it grabs the handle and slowly opens the door
only clothes are inside
he turns toward the other end of the room and cheryl pops up in the window right by him
he swings and fires shattering the window
cheryl backs away and spots the open front door
he makes a mad dash through shellys room
in the main room ashly races for the door
outside cheryl is almost upon the door
ashly arrives in time but cheryl has already started reaching in
he slams the door on her fingers and rams his gun butt down upon them
horrible screams are heard as cheryl withdraws her hand
ashly is able to slam the door and bolt it
he runs to the back entrance lead ing to the shed and locks it also
on his way back to the main room he pumps his rifle in preparation
it is his last shell
to himself more shells
where did i see that box of shells
from the basement the trap door lifts open and ashly decends
the bottom step now rotten breaks under his weight and ashly sprawls to the floor
slowly he picks himself up and walks through the dividing stone doorway beneath the water pipes to a small table
on it he finds the box of shells and quickly loads them into the gun
he ascends the steps and enters the main room once more
the sound of ticking catches ashlys attention
he looks up to see the old grandfather clock slowly winding back wards
he watches and waits tensely
turning carefully ashly tries to monitor all the windows
the ticking grows louder
a shadow passes in the window before him and he fires shattering the glass into a million pieces
wind whips through the cabin swirling glass and leaves to the floor
ashly waits leaning against the front door for something to happen
he is tense and more determined than ever to survive
he whispers to himself
cmon cmon get it over with why are you torturing me like this
placing his hand to his side ashly discovers something in his pocket
he lifts it to his eyes
it is lindas necklace
he whispers the ticking stops
he tilts his head for the slightest sound
all is silent
from behind two arms rip through the door and grab him
ashly tears away and falls to the floor
the necklace is tossed away in the confusion
cheryls hands pull away and she looks through a hole in the door
from the floor ashly raises his rifle and fires at her head
clutching at her face and screaming horribly cheryl is jolted from the door
ashly places a dresser and chair against the holes in the door
behind ashly scotts corpse sits up and opens its white eyes
it stands and moves toward ashly
he turns with the gun but scott knocks it out of his hands
desperately ashly grabs a table lamp and shatters it across scotts head then jams the exposed socket into his face shocking him
scott staggers back several steps then continues after ashly
outside cheryl is now pounding against the front door
ashly picks up a small table upon which are the book of the dead and the professors journal
he throws it at scott
this does not affect him and he advances closer
the book of the dead lands near the fireplace and edges of the paper darken from the heat
scott picks up ashly and begins to throttle him as if he were a rag doll
the front door begins to give under cheryls pounding
ashly brings his hands to scotts eyes
with a crash cheryl breaks through the front door and begins to push the dresser away
pages from the book of the dead are smolder ing now
ashly jams his fingers into scotts eyes and slips from the grip
scott clutches his eye sockets and his back begins to smolder
ashly now sees the book
its pages burn at the edge
cheryl topples the dresser and enters the room
her face is partially torn away from the shot gun blast
ashly rushes to throw the book onto the burning logs but cheryl smoldering also gives him a backhand blow across the head and he is sent sprawling to the floor
she grabs a fireplace poker with her crushed fingers and turns back to ashly who is crawl ing toward the fireplace
when almost in reach of the book scott grabs his leg and begins to pull ashly back ward
cheryl approaches with smoke pouring from her clothes and slams ashly across the back with her poker
a glitter catches his eye
it is lindas necklace
grabbing it he tosses the end with a clasp toward the book
it slides off the cover
scott pulls him back once more as ashly swings the necklace in a last desperate attempt
cheryl raises the poker for the final blow
the necklace drapes over the book and as ashly is dragged the clasp hooks the cover and pulls the book with him
with a yank he seizes the book and tosses it upon the blaze
cheryl and scott freeze
the book of the dead burns in a bluish green flame
smoke pours from scott and cheryl as distant demonical screams are heard from the woods
the fireplace poker slips from cheryls hand and sticks into the wood scarcely an inch from ashlys head
the bodies of scott and cheryl then begin to cave inward upon themselves collapsing to the floor in smoldering heaps
finally nothing is left but the burnt clothing and a blackish grey ooze on the floor where their bodies once were
the old clock begins to tick again normally
ashly slowly climbs to his feet to stand above the fuming debris
open ing his hand he looks down at lindas necklace
the force retreats from him out the door slowly returning to the darkness from which it emerged
gradually the natural sounds of the forest swell and trees lose their gloom as autumn colors return
the first rays of sunlight gleam over the woods beyond the cabin
daybreak has finally come
