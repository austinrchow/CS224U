boxes lie on the floor of the room
they are drawn up in crayon to look like a miniature western town
the bedroom is lined with cloud wallpaper giving the impression of sky
one of the boxes has a childrens illustrated wanted poster of a mr
potato head taped to it
potato head doll is set in front of the poster
the voice over of andy a year old boy can be heard acting out all the voices of the scene
alright everyone this is a stick up

a group of toys have been crowded together in front of the bank box
andys hand lowers a ceramic piggy bank in front of mr
potato head and shakes out a pile of coins to the floor
potato head kisses the coins
kissing noises a porcelain figurine of the shepherdess bo peep is brought into the scene
stop it you mean old potato
quiet bo peep or your sheep get run over
the companion porcelain sheep are placed in the center of a hot wheels track loop

woody a pull string doll cowboy enters into the scene opposite the inanimate spud
andys hand pulls on the ring in the center of woodys back

potato heads eyes

potato head and stretches him out
well i brought my dinosaur who eats force field dogs
andy reveals a plastic tyrannosaurus rex who stomps on the slinky dog
youre goin to jail bart
andy picks up mr
potato head and places him in a baby crib in the room
a cardboard sign is taped to the bars with the word jail written in crayon
say good bye to the wife and tatertots
andys year old sister molly crawls over and picks up mr
she sucks on him for a beat then proceeds to pound the toy repeatedly against the rail of her crib forcing some of his parts loose
andy wearing a cowboy hat himself picks up woody off the floor
pulling woodys string you saved the day again woody
youre my favorite deputy
song youve got a friend in me plays while andy does various activities with woody andy turns the western town boxes around to reveal cows drawn on the other side
he grabs a jump rope and pretends woody is lassoing the cattle
cmon lets wrangle up the cattle
andy then rides woody around on an rc remote control car and herds the remaining cow boxes under mollys crib
andy places woody on the top of the stairwell banister allowing the doll to slide downstairs
andy races ahead and catches him at the bottom
andy woody fall into the la z boy chair and spin around and around
next andy uses the la z boy foot rest as a catapult
andy flings woody across the room to the sofa
raising his arms score
woody lies limp on the sofa while andy is heard talking to his mother
whadda ya think
oh this looks great mom
davis andys thirty eight year old mom has just finished decorating the area with streamers and balloons
a banner is draped across the archway
it reads happy birthday andy
woodys frozen face stares in the direction of the birthday decorations

well sure we can leave it up
now go get molly
your friends are going to be here any minute
andy picks up woody from the couch and runs upstairs
its party time woody
andy and woody enter the room
molly is still banging potato head against her crib railing
andy tips woodys hat at her
howdy little lady
he deposits woody on the bed and pulls his string one last time
somebodys poisoned the waterhole

woodys eyes come to life
the cowboy doll sits up his expression changing from a smile to worry
to himself pull my string
the birthday partys today

the bedroom comes alive
toys emerge from the toy box the closet the shelves etc
in a flurry of activity
potato head his body parts strewn across the floor sits himself upright and begins to re assemble himself
ages three and up

hamm the piggy bank flips one last penny into his coin slot
potato head walks up to him
all his facial pieces are in the wrong slots
i dont get it
hamm walks away
you uncultured swine
to someone o
what are you looking at ya hockey puck
potato head walks past revealing a hockey puck figurine
woody sits on the edge of the bed observing all the activity
he turns to a plastic green army man sargent standing on the night stand
uh hey sarge have you seen slinky
okay thank you
woody hops off the bed
right here woody
a toy slinky dog slinky appears from under the bed pushing out a checker board set
he begins to place the checkers on the board
im red this time
no slink oh
well alright you can be red if you want
not now slink
ive got some bad news
sh h h h h
woody covers up slinkys mouth aware that the other toys in the room are watching
he leans in close to slinky
whispering just gather everyone up for a staff meeting and be happy
slinky shuffles off
slinky perks up his gait and laughs hard
woody proceeds in the other direction
he passes a toy robot and snake partially hidden under the bedspread
to the room staff meeting everybody
aside snake robot podium duty
robot and snake come out from under the bed and reluctantly follow woody
woody walks past an etch a sketch etch going the other direction
both etch and woody whip around like gunfighters
before woody can fully extend his arm out the etch a sketch etches a gun on its screen
pretending to be shot oh
you got me again etch
youve been working on that draw
fastest knobs in the west
slinky passes a group of toys on the floor
got a staff meeting you guys come on lets go
robot and snake begin constructing a podium made out of legos and a tinker toy tub while woody searches the floor
now where is that
aw hey who moved my doodle pad way over here
woody spots the doodle pad on the floor by the desk and walks over to it
as he reaches down to pick it up
rex the plastic dinosaur jumps out to scare woody
unaffected oh how ya doin rex
rex suddenly turns timid
were you scared
tell me honestly
i was close to being scared that time
woody heads back to the podium
im going for fearsome here but i just dont feel it
i think im just coming off as annoying
a crook suddenly grabs woodys neck and jerks him towards bo peep the porcelain figurine
oh hi bo
i wanted to thank you woody for saving my flock
blushing oh hey it was nothing
whadda ya say i get someone else to watch the sheep tonight
very flustered heh heh
oh yeah uh i
bo saunters back towards her lamp stand passing a stack of abc blocks
remember im just a couple of blocks away
woody is left lovestruck
all the rest of the toys in the room are filing past slinky
come on come on
smaller toys up front
woody remains lovestruck in the middle of the room
woody snaps out of his trance and rushes over to the podium
the toys crowd together as woody steps up to the podium
mike a toy tape recorder waddles up next to woody and indicates his microphone
grabbing microphone oh thanks mike
to the crowd okay to mike oh whoa step back mike waddles back a step to stop the feedback
everybody hear me
up on the shelf can you hear me
okay first item today

the toys all moan
you cant be serious
well i didnt know we were supposed to have one already
waving his arm out its socket do we have to hold hands
the toys laugh and snicker
oh yeah you guys think this is a big joke

come on potato head
if woody says its all right then well darnit its good enough for me
woody has never steered us wrong before
while slinky speaks potato head takes off his mouth and mimes kissing his own butt
every christmas and birthday we go through this
but what if andy gets another dinosaur
a mean one
i just dont think i can take that kind of rejection
hey listen no ones getting replaced
this is andy were talking about
woody steps down from the podium and walks towards the crowd
continued it doesnt matter how much were played with
what matters is that were here for andy when he needs us
thats what were made for
everyone is now looking down sheepish
i hate to break up the staff meeting but theyre here
birthday guests at three oclock
stay calm everyone
the toys panic and stampede over woody towards the bedroom window leaving him alone on the floor
uh meeting adjourned
the toys all crowd around the bedroom window trying to get a peek outside
will ya take a look at all those presents
i cant see a thing
unable to see over the crowd potato head pulls his eyes out of his head and holds them up over the other toys
children file towards the front door carrying presents
yessir were next months garage sale fodder for sure
panicked any dinosaur shaped ones
ah for crying out loud theyre all in boxes you idiot
the presents keep coming
theyre getting bigger
theres a nice little one over there
at first the kids present appears to be a little box but then the kid turns the present is four feet long
the toys scream
spell the word trashcan
down on the floor woody smacks his hand to his forehead in surrender
the toys turn inside and look down at woody
continued if i send out the troops will you all calm down
okay save your batteries
eh very good woody
thats using the old noodle
woody jumps up onto andys bed and turns to the sargent on the nightstand
establish a recon post downstairs
you know what to do
the green army man hops down to the floor where a bucket o soldiers sits
alright men you heard him
repeat we are at code red
recon plan charlie
lets move move move
the green army men file out of the bucket and march in formation across the bedroom floor
andys door creaks open and a lone army man ventures forth to make sure the coast is clear
satisfied he motions for the others to proceed
squads of soldiers march into the hall carrying a baby monitor and a jump rope
the army men each leapfrog behind the stairway banisters and hold their positions while the sargent surveys the scene below through his binoculars
directly below mrs
davis passes through the hallway rounding up andy and all his birthday guests
okay cmon kids
everyone in the living room
its almost time for the presents
davis and the children are out of sight the sargent motions to his men with a silent hand signal
two paratroopers jump out through the railing parachuting down to the floor below
the paratroopers sweep the area with their plastic rifles then give the all clear sign
the jump rope is lowered and more soldiers rappel down
the toys race towards the nightstand where woody has placed the receiving half of the baby monitor
and this turning on the baby monitor is how we find out what is in those presents
the green army men march in formation across the floor when suddenly
can be heard approaching from behind the connecting kitchen door
immediately the sargent signals for his men to freeze in their various classic action poses
okay whos hungry
here come the chips
ive got cool ranch and barbeque the door opens and mrs
davis foot comes down hard on top of a soldier
what in the world
oh i thought i told him to pick these up
with a sweep of her foot she brushes the army men out of her path and continues on to the living room
shouldnt they be there by now
whats taking them so long
hey these guys are professionals
theyre the best
cmon theyre not lying down on the job
as soon as mom is gone the sargent motions for his men to proceed toward a nearby houseplant that looks into the living room
the sargent then notices an injured soldier struggling to drag himself forward a casualty of mrs
the sargent helps the injured soldier to his feet
moans go on without me
a good soldier never leaves a man behind
the sargent motions to the remaining men above
they lower themselves via jump rope riding the baby monitor
once downstairs they hustle the baby monitor towards the houseplant
bounces into the hallway followed by the sound of footsteps and kid clamor
the sargent supporting his wounded man reaches the plant right on the heels of the squad with the baby monitor
they conceal themselves in the house plant just before the children run by
while the baby monitor is set in place a medic evaluates the wounded soldier and gives the thumbs up signal
the sargent scans the party with his binoculars
the pile of brightly wrapped gifts sits atop the living room coffee table
there they are
the toys perk up as static suddenly emits from the baby monitor
over monitor come in mother bird this is alpha bravo
this is it
this is it
quiet quiet quiet
over monitor come in mother bird
andys opening the first present now

hey watch it

i knew you were right all along woody
never doubted you for a second
the platoon is preparing to exit the plant when

the sargent lifts his binoculars back to his eyes
davis can be seen opening the closet and pulling out another large present
indicating the baby monitor wait turn that thing back on
over monitor come in mother bird come in mother bird
all the toys tense up
continued mom has pulled a surprise present from the closet
andys opening it
hes really excited about this one
its a huge package
oh get out one of the kids is in the way i cant see
from monitor its
its a the sound of children cheering emits from the monitor cutting off the sargent
its a what
what is it
rex grabs a leg of the nightstand and shakes it making the monitor drop to the floor
the impact causes the batteries to roll out
oh ya big lizard
now well never know what it is
sarcastic way to go rex
everyone rushes to the fallen monitor
potato head tries to correctly insert the batteries
turn em around turn em around
eh hes puttin em in backwards
plus is positive minus is negative
oh let me
woody jumps down off the bed and shoves both hamm and potato head aside
lets go to my room guys
the kids rush past the houseplant
into the monitor woody puts the last battery back in
over monitor juvenile intrusion
resume your positions now
andys coming everybody
back to your places
the toys panic and scatter about the room
wheres my ear
whos seen my ear
did you see my ear
outta my way
here i come here i come frantic rex slams into a trashcan and falls over
everyone scurries to their places as the kids footsteps grow louder
woody falls limp in his spot on the bed just as
andys bedroom door flies open and a flood of childrens feet rush in
his lasers light up
take that zurg
woody is flung off andys pillow and slides unnoticed down the gap between the bed and the back wall
make a space
this is where the spaceship lands
and you press his back and he does a karate chop action
come on down guys
its time for games
weve got prizes
the kids all run out as fast as they entered slamming the door behind them
the toys slowly come to life and make their way toward the bed
what is it
can you see it
what the heck is up there
whos up there with you
woody crawls out from under the bed
the toys are shocked to discover him there
woody what are you doing under the bed
composing himself uh h h h
im sure andy was just a little excited thats all
too much cake and ice cream i suppose
its just a mistake
well that mistake is sitting in your spot woody
have you been replaced
what did i tell you earlier
no one is getting replaced
the toys give each other a look of doubt
now lets all be polite and give whatever it is up there a nice big andys room welcome
woody climbs slowly up the side of the bed peeking over the edge
his eyes widen at the sight of
we see buzz as woody does an expensive looking space age action figure covered with buttons and stickers from head to toe
the imposing g
joe sized doll stands heroically in the center of the bed his back to woody
buzz comes alive and looks around
while he scans the bedroom a darth vader like breathing is heard
buzz eyes it all suspiciously and pushes a button on his chest
buzz lightyear to star command
come in star command
he pushes the button again
star command come in
do you read me
to himself why dont they answer
just then buzz catches sight of his ripped packaging
the box is designed to look like a spaceship
he runs up to the box and investigates the damage
thisll take weeks to repair
buzz flips open a plastic compartment on his arm his wrist communicator
buzz lightyear mission log
stardate my ship has run off course en route to sector
ive crash landed on a strange planet
the impact must have awoken me from hyper sleep
buzz springs up and down on the squishy surface of the bed
into communicator terrain seems a bit unstable
he taps the sticker of controls on his wrist communicator
into communicator no read out yet if the air is breathable
and there seems to be no sign of intelligent life anywhere woodys face suddenly pops into view
hello o o
buzz jumps back taking a fighting stance
he presses a button on his arm that turns on a red laser beam light on his wrist
buzz aims the red beam on woodys forehead and holds it there
whoa hey whoa did i frighten you
didnt mean to
my name is woody and this is andys room
thats all i wanted to say and also there has been a bit of a mix up
this is my spot see the bed here while woody is speaking buzz notices the sheriffs badge on woodys vest
de activating his laser beam local law enforcement
its about time you got here
im buzz lightyear space ranger universe protection unit
my ship has crash landed here by mistake
buzz begins walking around the bed surveying the situation
woody tries to keep up
yes it is a mistake because you see the bed here is my spot
i need to repair my turbo boosters
do you people still use fossil fuels or have you discovered crystalic fusion
well lets see weve got double as watch yourself
buzz shoves woody down on the bed and re activates his wrist laser
who goes there
the other toys are peeking over the edge of the bed
to woody do you know these life forms
theyre andys toys
youre clear to come up
buzz walks over to the toys
i am buzz lightyear
i come in peace
rex steps forward and eagerly shakes buzzs hand
oh im so glad youre not a dinosaur
why thank you
pulls away now thank you all for your kind welcome
whats that button do
ill show you
buzz presses a button on his chest
buzz lightyear to the rescue
the toys all gasp in awe
hey woodys got something like that
his is a pullstring only it only it sounds like a car ran over it
oh yeah but not like this one
this is a quality sound system
probably all copper wiring huh
so uh where are you from
no actually im stationed up in the gamma quadrant of sector
as a member of the elite universe protection unit of the space ranger corps i protect the galaxy from the threat of invasion from the evil emperor zurg sworn enemy
of the galactic alliance
as buzz speaks woody glances down at the box in which buzz arrived
there is a cartoon drawing of buzz giving the exact word for word spiel that buzz is now giving
im from playskool
and im from mattel
well im not actually from mattel im actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buy out
well i dont really understand the financials but
woody walks over to bo peep
youd think theyve never seen a new toy before
well sure look at him
hes got more gadgets on him then a swiss army knife
slinky presses the button on buzzs arm activating his laser light
buzz quickly pulls his arm away
ah ah ah please be careful
you dont want to be in the way when my laser goes off
hey a laser
how come you dont have a laser woody
its not a laser
its a little lightbulb that blinks
whats with him
all right thats enough
look were all very impressed with andys new toy toy
t o y
excuse me i think the word youre searching for is space ranger
the word im searching for i cant say because theres pre school toys present
gettin kind of tense arent you
oh uh mr
now im curious
what does a space ranger actually do
hes not a space ranger
he doesnt fight evil or shoot lasers or fly excuse me
buzz calmly hits a button and wings pop out
again the toys gasp in awe
oh impressive wingspan
these are plastic
he cant fly
they are a terillium carbonic alloy and i can fly
no you cant
yes i can
i tell you i could fly around this room with my eyes closed
okay then mr
all right then i will
to toys stand back everyone
the crowd of toys make room for buzz as he heads towards the edge of the bed and climbs up the bedpost
he poses like a high diver shuts his eyes
to infinity and beyond
and leaps off the bed
buzz plummets straight down hits a big rubber ball and bounces right back up
he then lands on a hotwheels car which races him down the track through the loop and off a ramp
buzz soars upward into a plane mobile hanging from the ceiling
buzz becomes wedged between the planes wheels
the impact turns on the planes motor making it and buzz spin around and around
all the other toys watch from the bed mesmerized
finally the centrifugal force causes buzz to separate from the plane sailing him across the room toward the bed
buzz makes a perfect landing right in front of woody and then opens his eyes
the crowd of toys rush buzz cheering and clapping with whoa
you flew magnificently
i found my moving buddy
why thank you
thank you all
that wasnt flying
that was falling with style
man the dolls must really go for you
aside can you teach me that
woody stands alone at the other end of the bed fuming
slinky caught up in the euphoria approaches woody
heh heh heh
golly bob howdy oh shut up
in a couple of days everything will be just the way it was
im still andys favorite toy
song strange things plays over montage
a andy plays with woody jumping up and down on the bed running around the room
b andy sets woody down on the floor
next he lands buzz lightyear on the floor opposite woody
andy shoots buzzs laser at woody and then smacks woody across the room as if hed been blown away by the laser
c andy runs into his closet wearing his cowboy hat and cowboy pajamas
andy runs out of the closet clad in buzz lightyear pajamas and a homemade spacemans helmet
buzz lightyear to the rescue
d woody observes all the cowboy themed items in the bedroom transform to space motif the posters the drawings on the wall the pillow the bedspread
e buzz watches rex execute a wimpy roar
the space ranger suggests a few tips for the dinosaur
rex tries again this time giving a jurassic park roar
the roar blasts potato heads features right off his face
f woody passes etch a sketch whos sporting a portrait of buzz
woody looks across the room to see buzz combing troll dolls hair chatting away like a hair dresser
woody angrily shakes etch removing buzzs image
g rocky snake troll doll and rex are lifting tinkertoys as weights
buzz works out on top of an upside down robot using his feet as a treadmill
potato head attempts to lift his tinkertoy barbell but ends up tumbling backwards leaving his arms connected to the barbell
h woody looks under the bed for slinky finding only the checkerboard
woody peeks around the corner of the bed to see slinky and robot under buzzs direction setting buzzs ship up on top of abc blocks for repair
in frustration woody kicks the checkerboard sending the pieces flying
one of the checkers ricochets off the dresser and boomerangs into woodys mouth
i on andys bed buzz pets slinky whose back end is stretched over to the other side where woody sits
slinkys wagging tail whacks woody in the face repeatedly
woody shoves slinkys rear end off the bed leaving his front end no choice but to eventually follow
j at bedtime andy loads his toys into the toybox until just woody and buzz are left
he deliberates as to which toy to keep and which to toss into the toybox
andy is sound asleep with buzz tucked under the covers next to him
woody peeks out at them from the toybox and then sadly sinks back into the box closing the lid to
the black screen splits horizontally to become
all is clear no sign of andy
woody throws open the lid of the toy box
he takes a couple deep breaths of fresh air then discovers that his hat is missing
looking back into the toy box hey
whos got my hat
the rubber shark pops up wearing woodys cowboy hat
look im woody
howdy howdy howdy
sarcastic ah hah
ah hah hah
grabs the hat give me that
woody leaps out of the toy box
say there lizard and stretchy dog
let me show you something
it looks as though ive been accepted into your culture
woody looks up to see buzz chatting with rex and slinky
continued your chief andy inscribed his name on me
buzz puts his foot out so that slinky and rex can see the sole of his boot
the name andy is written on it in permanent marker
with permanent ink too
well i must get back to repairing my ship
buzz walks away
woody looks at his foot andy is written on it also but in a much more childish scrawl and is largely faded
dont let it get to you woody
hearing bo woody puts his foot back down and quickly straightens up
nonchalant uh let what
i dont uh what do you mean
i know andys excited about buzz but you know hell always have a special place for you
walking past yeah
like the attic
woody angrily marches across the room
across the room buzzs cardboard ship is still up on the abc blocks
buzz lies down on a skateboard and slides under the ship like a mechanic
snake and robot stand by waiting for instructions
buzzs hand reaches out from under the ship
unidirectional bonding strip
robot turns towards snake who stands in readiness by a tape dispenser
lightyear wants more tape
snake rips off a piece of tape with his mouth
woody approaches the skateboard grabs hold of buzzs foot and rolls him out from under the ship
listen lightsnack you stay away from andy
hes mine and no one is taking him away from me
what are you talking about
to robot wheres that bonding strip
buzz rolls himself back under
woody rolls him out again
and another thing
stop with this spaceman thing
its getting on my nerves
are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with star command
oh okay so you want to do it the hard way huh
buzz stands up face to face with woody
dont even think about it cowboy
oh yeah tough guy
woody pushes buzz in the chest accidentally activating a button that makes the spacemans helmet open
buzz grabs his neck gasping for air
he drops to his knees and begins to writhe on the ground holding his breath
woody is unsure how to react
suddenly buzz sniffs the air
the air isnt toxic
buzz rises and points an accusing finger at woody
how dare you open a spacemans helmet on an uncharted planet
my eyeballs couldve been sucked from their sockets
buzz closes his helmet
you actually think youre the buzz lightyear
oh all this time i thought it was an act
to the room hey guys
its the real buzz lightyear
youre mocking me arent you
oh no no no
pointing behind buzz buzz look
buzz falls for the trick and turns around
woody kneels over with laughter
woody stops short
all the toys look to the bedroom window
ah ha ha ha
slinky hides under the bed
i thought he was at summer camp
they must have kicked him out early this year
the toys rush over to the window
from out the window sid phillips a hyperactive ten year old and his dog scud can be roughly made out jumping around in their backyard
a tiny figure stands isolated in the center of the yard
sid pummels the figure with rocks while scud strains at his leash barking wildly
who is it this time
i cant tell
hey wheres lenny
right here woody
woody turns to see lenny a pair of wind up binoculars approaching him from the other end of the desk
woody picks lenny up and looks through him to survey the scene
i cant bear to watch one of these again
a full size toy soldier is posed in a running stance in the center of the backyard
a huge m is strapped to the dolls back with masking tape
its a combat carl
plays under the next lines just stay where you are corporal
dont move carl
youll blow up
i know youre tired
i know your leg is cramping but you cant move
do you hear me
buzz breaks through the crowd
whats going on
nothing that concerns you spacemen
just us toys
id better take a look anyway
buzz grabs lenny from woody and looks through him
why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device
redirecting buzzs view thats why
sure is a hairy fellah
no thats scud you idiot
again woody readjusts buzzs view
he is sporting a skull t shirt and laughing hideously
that is sid
you mean that happy child
that aint no happy child
he tortures toys just for fun
well then weve got to do something
buzz steps up onto the window ledge
the toys gasp in shock
what are you doing
get down from there
im going to go teach that boy a lesson
you go ahead
melt him with your scary laser
woody presses buzzs laser button
it emits a wimpy electronic beep
buzz quickly pulls his arm away
be careful with that its extremely dangerous
while woody and buzz banter lenny witnesses sid lighting the fuse of the m
hes lighting it
hes lighting it
hit the dirt
the toys jump away from the window
dirt clouds and toy shrapnel rain down along the side of andys house
andys toys peek over the window sill
a large black scorch mark is all that remains where combat carl once stood
sid jumps up and down victoriously while scud resumes his barking
i could have stopped him
buzz i would love to see you try
gesturing to sids yard course id love to see you as a crater
sid cackles and dances around the crater
the sooner we move the better
a for sale real estate sign stands in the front yard
another sign reading sold hangs from the bottom
mom opens the door to andys room and steps in
the room is full of packing boxes most of them half full
andy is playing with woody and buzz
to infinity and beyond
oh all this packing makes me hungry
what would you say to dinner at uh oh pizza planet
andy throws the two toys on his desk with buzz landing right on top of woody
go wash your hands and ill get molly ready
the minute the door is closed woody comes alive and shoves buzz off of him
can i bring some toys
you can bring one toy
woody perks up with concern
to himself one toy
he glances over his shoulder at buzz who is walking away towards the opposite end of the desk
woody picks up a magic ball left beside him on the desk
with his back to buzz woody quietly shakes the ball
whispering will andy pick me
he tips the ball over
the triangular oracle floats up to the surface
its prediction reads dont count on it
dont count on it
doh h h h
woody throws down the ball in disgust
it rolls across the desk and falls behind it with a loud thud
woody suddenly becomes interested in the back of the desk and peers down it
the ball is wedged way down near the bottom
the space is a black chasm dark and deep just big enough to fit
woody looks across the desk at buzz
he is humming to himself as he forages through andys pen pencil tray looking for tools to repair his ship with
right behind buzz sits it rests on the desktop pointing in the direction where the ball fell with the remote laying by its side
woody smiles for a beat and then runs in a panic over to buzz
oh buzz buzz lightyear
buzz lightyear thank goodness
weve got trouble
looking around where
pointing to the back of the desk down there
just down there
a helpless toy
its trapped buzz
then weve no time to lose
buzz runs over and looks down the back of the desk
i dont see anything
woody picks up the remote for the rc car and switches it on
rcs eyes headlights open sleepily
oh hes there
just just keep looking
woody hits the forward button on the remote and steers the rc car straight for buzz
what kind of a toy
buzz turns to see rc headed straight for him
he dives out of the way as the rc car smashes into the base of
the impact forces pushpins to fly out of the board
buzz ducks as pins land all around him sticking into the desk like arrows
sits on the floor in the midst of a card game with hamm
he looks up at the desk and gasps as the bulletin board slams down onto
knocking it out of its stand
the globe starts rolling right at buzz
woody stands frozen in disbelief at the chaos hes created
buzz runs along the desk the globe rolling right behind him indiana jones style
buzz gets stuck log rolling on a pile of pencils but at the last second jumps out of the way onto the window ledge
the globe lumbers past buzz and strikes a luxo style desklamp
the arm of the lamp swings all the way around barely missing woody
and knocks buzz out the window
woody looks out the window
no sign of buzz
all the other toys rush over to the sill
i dont see him in the driveway
i think he bounced into sids yard
woody backs away from the commotion unnoticed
electric motor sounds whirrr
rex looks over at rc
the remote control car is bouncing up and down excitedly
rcs trying to say something
the toys turn from the window to rc
leaning down close to rc what is it boy
electric motor sounds whirrr
hes sayin that this was no accident
what do you mean
i mean humpty dumpty was pushed
pointing at woody by woody
the toys turn to woody who suddenly realizes how this looks
wait a minute

potato head to you you back stabbin murderer

backing away oh i dont like confrontations
the sargent pops out of the army bucket next to woody
where is your honor dirtbag
you are an absolute disgrace

potato head starts closing in on woody
couldnt handle buzz cuttin in on your playtime could ya woody
didnt want to face the fact that buzz just might be andys new favorite toy so you got rid of him
well what if andy starts playin with me more woody huh
you gonna knock me outta the window too
potato head has driven woody back to the very edge of the desk trapped
i dont think we should give him the chance
suddenly the lid pops off the bucket of army men
there he is men
the army men yell charge and pounce on woody while all the rest of the toys close in
lets string him up by his pull string
i got dibs on his hat
would you boys stop it
no no no no
wait i can explain everything andy cmon
okay mom be right down
ive got to get buzz
the toys all drop woody and rush back to their places
andy enters the room and heads straight for the desk where woody is lying
andy overlooks woody and begins searching around the room
do you know where buzz is
no i havent seen him
woody painfully watches as andy searches in vain for buzz
woody looks across the room
potato head and etch a sketch peek out of a packing box
etch a sketch scribbles a hangmans noose while potato head points an accusing finger in woodys direction
im heading out the door
but mom i cant find him
well honey just grab some other toy
he grabs woody and walks out of the room
andy exits the house dragging woody as he heads toward the family van in the driveway
i couldnt find my buzz
i know i left him right there
honey im sure hes around
youll find him
next to the van begins to rustle
hands part the foliage revealing buzz
he eyes woody going into the van and does a slow burn
the van engine starts up
buzz races out of the bush and with a mighty leap grabs the rear fender of the van as it pulls out of the driveway
a chain of monkeys falls into view dangling a considerable distance above the ground
the rest of andys toys have regrouped at the window supervising the lowering of the monkey chain
its too short
we need more monkeys
holding up an empty barrel there arent any more
thats the whole barrel
rex throws the barrel down and runs back to the ledge
yelling out window buzz
the monkeys arent working
were formulating another plan
beat oh where could he be
the davis family van pulls up to one of the pumps
andy sits in the rear seat with woody lying next to him
can i help pump the gas
ill even let you drive
davis and andy exit the van while baby molly sleeps up front in her car seat
yeah when youre sixteen
sarcastic yuk yuk yuk funny mom
with mom and andy out of range woody comes to life
he stares out the sun roof still reeling from everything
how am i gonna convince those guys it was an accident
suddenly buzz appears over the edge of the sun roof
buzz jumps down on the back seat to face woody
he is furious
this is great
oh im saved
andyll find you here hell take us back to the room and then you can tell everyone that this was all just a big mistake
no response from buzz
just an angry stare
i just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet
oh thats good
getting in woodys face but were not on my planet are we
buzz lunges for woody
the two toys fly off the seat and out the open side door of the van
woody and buzz hit the ground and roll under the van locked in mortal combat
you want a piece of me
buzz lands a punch that sends woodys head spinning around
woody lunges with all his might
he smacks buzz in the face making it squeak with every blow
buzz closes his helmet on woodys hand
woody pounds on buzzs chest with his free hand activating buzzs sampled voice buttons
the toys stop fighting
before they can react
the van drives off
woody starts to run in the direction of the van but it drives out of sight leaving buzz and woody stranded
doesnt he realize that im not there
beat im lost
oh im a lost toy
meanwhile buzz checks the surroundings
he flips open his wrist communicator
buzz lightyear mission log
the local sheriff and i seem to be at a huge refueling station of some sort woody whips around his expression changing from panic to seething anger
he charges at buzz
just then the toys are bathed in the headlight beams of a behemoth tanker truck pulling into the station
buzz dives off to the side while woody collapses right where he stands on the pavement
the truck roars over him
stops just millimeters from woodys nose
petrified woody inches away from the tire moving back under the truck until he bumps into buzz
into wrist communicator according to my nava computer the whispering shut up
just shut up you idiot
sheriff this is no time to panic
this is the perfect time to panic
im lost andy is gone theyre going to move from their house in two days and its all your fault
if you hadnt pushed me out of the window in the first place oh yeah
well if you hadnt shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me dont talk to me about importance
because of you the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy
what are you talking about
buzz walk to the edge of the truck tire and points up to the stars
right now poised at the edge of the galaxy emperor zurg has been secretly building a weapon with the destructive capacity to annihilate an entire planet
i alone have information that reveals this weapons only weakness
pointing at woody and you my friend are responsible for delaying my rendez vous with star command
you are a toy
you arent the real buzz lightyear youre an action figure
you are a childs plaything
you are a sad strange little man and you have my pity
buzz walks off
well good riddance ya looney
woody walks away in the opposite direction
to himself rendez vous with star command
hey gas dude
you talkin to me
yeah man can you help me
do you know where cutting blvd
just a moment
woody looks in the direction of the bell
his face lights up at the sight of
to himself pizza planet
woody takes a step forward and then stops
i cant show my face in that room without buzz
woody runs back under the tanker truck
buzz is at the far end of the truck walking away from woody
buzz come back
continuing to walk away go away
woody looks back at the delivery truck in desperation and then eyes
atop the truck is a rocket with the pizza planet logo
no buzz youve gotta come back
i found a spaceship
buzz stops walking away and looks back at woody
its a spaceship buzz
the delivery trucks engine has stalled and is off
cmon man hurry up
um like the pizzas are getting cold here
woody and buzz eye the parked delivery truck from within the safety of a nearby oilcan display
now youre sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply
and when we get there well be able to find a way to transport you
well then lets climb abroad
buzz makes a beeline for the passenger side door of the pizza truck
woody chases after him
no no no wait buzz buzz lets get in the back
no one will see us there
there are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area
well be much safer in the cockpit
in a flash buzz has scaled the front tire grabbed the rear view mirror and swung himself up and into the cab
loud whisper yeah but buzz
ok so thats two lefts and then a right huh
okay thanks for the directions
loud whisper buzz
woody runs around to the back of the truck scrambles up the bumper and throws open the back hatch to climb inside
woody lets out a yell as the back hatch slams back down on his rear sending him flying into the bed of the truck
woody peeks through the dividing window into the cab
buzz is hidden from the pizza drivers view by a stack of pizzas in their insulated covers
buzz prudently fastens his safety belt
itll be safer in the cockpit than the cargo bay
what an idiot
the driver shifts into gear and hits the gas propelling woody to the back of the truck
the pizza deliverer drives like a maniac taking sharp turns and hills at high speeds
woody is helplessly thrown around the truck
with every blow woody yelps in pain
the truck climbs a steep hill
woody looks up just in time to see
barreling towards him
we move down to reveal
the delivery truck barrels into the parking lot and parks
after the driver leaves the truck buzz peeks out from the passenger window
two imposing animatronic robots guard the doorway
as customers approach the front the guards part their crossed pizza spears allowing the patrons to enter
you are clear to enter
welcome to pizza planet
various announcements blare out from speakers next shuttle lift off scheduled for t minus minutes and counting
the white zone is for eating pizza only
the white zone is for
excited buzz pries open the window between the cab and truck bed
woody is gone
just the toolbox and strewn trash
the toolbox falls on its side revealing woody
he peels off the back of the truck and falls into a pile of trash
there you are
now the entrance is heavily guarded
we need a way to get inside
woody rises from the trash with a mega gulp cup on his head
great idea woody
i like your thinking
in the f
sits a trashcan with fast food containers littered around it
more customers approach the guarded entrance
you are clear to enter
welcome to pizza planet
the front doors automatically swing open as the people pass through
suddenly two pieces of trash a burger container and mega gulp cup stand up
in burger container the two disguised toys make a dash through the closing doors
in container quickly sheriff
the airlock is closing
woody and buzz just make it inside but then freeze immediately as a group of kids run past forcing the toys to pose as discarded trash
once the coast is clear woody and buzz resume walking
buzz bumps into woody
using straw as periscope ow
watch where youre going
mouthing with burger box sorry
they sneak in between two long rows of video games and throw off their disguises
they then take a good look at
the space themed arena is filled with hordes of children playing video games
a sea of hi tech sounds and lights overwhelm the place
buzz is beaming with hope
what a space port
good work woody
woody is busy looking at all the children in the arcade but none of the kids look familiar to him
just then he hears
mom can i play black hole
please please please
woody turns around and through the video games he spots
standing with mom and molly in her stroller
to himself andy
whats black hole
oh its so cool
the family begins to walk away
now we need to find a ship thats headed for sector buzz is about to head off in the opposite direction when woody grabs him and quickly pulls him down
the video corridor
wait a minute
theres a special ship
i just saw it
you mean it has hyperdrive
hyper active hyperdrive and astro
the toys manage to get ahead of andy
woody peeks around the corner of one of the video games and waits for mom and andy to approach
tracking andy and family cmon cmon thats it
where is it
i dont see the buzz stops short at the sight of
it is modeled to look like a spaceship ready to launch
alright buzz get ready
buzz heads for the crane game but woody does not notice his eyes locked on the approaching stroller
okay buzz when i say go were gonna jump in the basket woody turns and realizes buzz is gone
he looks across the way just in time to see buzz leap into the crane game through the prize slot
loud whisper buzz
woody turns back in the direction of the stroller
it has already gone past
this cannot be happening to me
woody runs towards the crane game but is forced to hold back for a moment as some screaming children pass by
buzz climbs over the partition that divides the deposit slot from the prize toys and leaps into a pile of
there are hundreds of them all identical and way too cute
excited a stranger
from the outside
oo o o o o o
i am buzz lightyear
i come in peace
what is it like outside
the squeeze toys rush buzz like jabbering excited children
with the kids gone woody crosses the aisle to the crane game and dives through the prize slot
woody clambers up the side of the deposit slot
this is an intergalactic emergency
i need to commandeer your vessel to sector
woody peeks over the partition to witness buzz surround by the cute alien toys
continued to the aliens whos in charge here
all the aliens point upward
the cla a a a a a a a w
woody and buzz look up
it dangles directly above the toys
the claw is our master
the claw chooses who will go and who will stay
to himself this is ludicrous
laughter woody gasps at the recognition of sids voice
he turns to see sid heading straight for the crane game
woody leaps off the partition and tackles buzz pushing the two of them deep into the pile of aliens
sid approaches the crane game and fishes quarters out of his pants pocket
loud whisper whats gotten into you sheriff
i was loud whisper you are the one that decided to climb into this loud whisper sh h h h h h
it moves into position and hovers directly above the area where woody and buzz are hiding
the crane drops and grabs hold of the alien toy that is right on top of buzz
whispering excitedly i have been chosen
positioned with his back to sid the alien is lifted up by the claw
continued farewell my friends
i go on to a better place
with the alien gone buzzs upper torso becomes exposed forcing the space ranger to freeze
sid suddenly spots buzz
a buzz lightyear
woody still hidden frantically looks around for some way to escape
behind him through the aliens he eyes
woody swims through the alien squeeze toys toward the door
he grabs hold of the locking latch and after a few attempts is able to pry the door open
the shadow of the crane lines up over buzz lowers and grabs his head
the claw begins to lift buzz up
woody grabs hold of buzzs feet
woody and the claw begin to have a tug of war with buzz
woody pulls down hard forcing buzz to sink into the pile of aliens out of sids view
slamming his fist against the glass wha
still tugging against the crane woody is almost out the door with buzz
just then the aliens at the bottom of the pile pull buzz and woody back inside
he has been chosen
what are you doing
he must go
stop it you
stop it you zealots
he must go
do not fight the claw
do not anger the claw
he has been chosen
woody and buzz are pushed up to the surface and into the air dangling lifelessly in front of sid
woody and buzz are dropped into the prize door slot and snatched up by sid
looking at his two new toys lets go home and
ha ha ha
from out of the darkness appears sid on his skateboard
he is humming to rock music from his walkman while carrying his backpack in his hand
sid leaps off the skateboard and walks up the front path towards the front door
through the open zipper buzz peeks out of the backpack to see sids house
he recognizes andys house next door
buzz woody and a squeeze toy alien are scrunched up in the backpack
i can see your dwelling from here
youre almost home
nirvana is coming
the mystic portal awaits
to alien will you be quiet
to both you guys dont get it do you
once we go into sids house we wont be coming out
the front door opens to reveal scud
the dog lunges straight for the backpack barking
the dog begrudgingly obeys
hey i got somethin for ya boy
sids hand reaches into the backpack
loud whisper the toys go still
sids hand grabs the alien out of the backpack
the alien is then placed sideways along scuds snout
ready set now
in one quick motion scud flips the alien up catches it in his mouth and rabidly shakes it back and forth
buzz and woody react in horror
woody and buzz glance up to see hannah sids frail little sister carrying her janie doll
did i get my package in the mail
whaddaya mean you dont know
insistent i dont know
mock concern oh no hannah
he grabs the doll
panic rising no shes not ill have to perform one of my
no o o
dont touch her
sid bolts upstairs with hannah in pursuit
not sids room
sid races to his bedroom door
hannah is right behind
give her back
sid just laughs
he charges into the room and slams the door in his sisters face
pounding on his door sid
sid carelessly tosses the backpack on the bed and walks over to a makeshift workbench
as doctor oh no
we have a sick patient here nurse
prepare the o
sid clicks on a bare bulb dangling above his operating table
woody and buzz look on from the safety of the backpack as sid places the janie dolls head in a vise
sid give her back
give her back now
as doctor patient is
straining while tightening vise pre e epped
sid grabs a painters mask from his toolchest and dons it like a surgeons mask
as doctor no ones ever attempted a double bypass brain transplant before
sid grabs a toy pterodactyl from a nearby crate full of junk
as doctor now for the tricky part pliers
whispering to woody i dont believe that mans ever been to medical school
sid struggles for a moment with his patient then stops
as nurse doctor youve done it
running to the door hannah
he opens the door
hannah is standing there looking worried
continued janies all better now
he hands her janie her head has been replaced with a pterodactyls
hannah screams at the sight of the monstrosity and bolts down the hallway
whatever she says its not true
sid throws the doll to the ground and runs after hannah slamming the door behind him
woody and buzz peer out of the backpack at their new surroundings
heavy metal posters discarded toy remains and power tools adorn the messy room
they are in hell
we are gonna die
bolting out of the pack im outta here
woody leaps from the bed to the doorknob and struggles to open it
woody drops to the floor
theres gotta be another way out of here
woody is startled by the noise
a small yo yo rolls out from behind a box and falls on its side
spooked woody grabs a pencil from the floor and brandishes it like a weapon
just then a shadow passes by woody
he turns quickly but sees nothing
was that you
woody hurriedly trades his pencil for a larger flashlight
he hears a noise from under sids bed
woody turns on the flashlight and shines the beam in the direction of the noise illuminating
hi there little fellah
come out here
do you know a way out of here
the baby doll moves out from under the bed revealing a one eyed doll head atop a spider like body made of erector set pieces
the creature extends its legs and rises up taller than woody
scared speechless woody keeps his flashlight beam locked on various other mutant toys begin to emerge from the shadows a toy fishing pole with fashion doll legs a skateboard with
a combat soldiers torso screwed to the front end a jack in the box with a rubber hand for a head and others
woody leaps onto the bed and hides behind buzz
b b b buzz
buzz and woody look on as the mutants have a tug of war as they grab all the janie and pterodactyl parts dragging them off into the shadows
woody retreats back into the backpack
woody cowers in the corner as buzz enters
he punches a button on his chest
come in star command
pause star command do you copy
buzz adjusts his laser light
it emits a short blip
aiming his arm out the pack ive set my laser from stun to kill
oh great great
yeah and if anyone attacks us we can blink em to death
rex points a flashlight out of andys bedroom window while bo peep slinky hamm and potato head look on
some bushes rustle below
hey you guys
i think ive found him
is that you
rex points the flashlight beam at the shaking bushes
the annoyed meow of a cat is heard
will you get out of here
youre interfering with the search and rescue
rex turns off the flashlight
the toys duck behind the sill
the davis family van pulls into the driveway
andy and mrs
davis get out
mom have you seen woody
where was the last place you left him
searching the van right here in the van
oh im sure hes there
youre just not looking hard enough
hes not here mom
the toys all look at one another
well waddah ya know the weasel ran away
hamm potato head and rex walk away from the window
i told you he was guilty
who wouldve thought he was capable of such atrocities
bo peep and slinky are left alone at the window visibly crestfallen
oh slink i hope hes okay
as interrogator oh a survivor
where is the rebel base
an inanimate woody flies across the room landing hard on the floor
sid crosses to the window
as interrogator i can see your will is strong
sid opens the window shade
bright sunlight shines down onto woody
continued well we have ways of making you talk
sid pulls out a magnifying glass from his back pocket and focuses the beam on woodys forehead
as interrogator where are your rebel friends now
a bright white hot dot forms on woodys forehead and begins to smolder
your pop tarts are ready
sid pulls the magnifying glass away
sid runs out of the room
as soon as hes gone woody jumps up screaming his forehead burning
he runs to a bowl of half eaten cereal with milk on the floor and dunks his head in
buzz runs over to woody pausing to remove two suction cup darts from his person before pulling woody out of the bowl
two colorful froot loops stick to each of woodys eyes like glasses
are you alright
whacking him on the back im proud of you sheriff
a lesser man would have talked under such torture
woody looks at his reflection in the back of the cereal spoon and rubs the burn mark on his forehead
i sure hope this isnt permanent
checking his wrist communicator still no word from star command
were not that far from the spaceport woodys eyes light up
sids bedroom door can be seen in the reflection
woody runs for the door
woody we dont know whats out there
ill tell you whats aaaah
suddenly appear and block their path to the doorway
woody hides behind buzz
theyre gonna eat us buzz
shield your eyes
buzz fires his laser at them
the little red beam just flickers against babyfaces head
the mutant toys look confusedly at each other
its not working
i recharged it before i left
it should be good for hours oh you idiot
youre a toy
use your karate chop action
grabbing buzz like a hostage woody fends off the mutant toys by pushing a large button on buzzs back making buzzs arm involuntarily chop up and down
to mutants get away
how are you doing that
back you savages
woody circles around the mutant toys to the open doorway continually chopping buzzs arm
woody stop it
sorry guys but dinners canceled
woody drops buzz and runs out the door
woody races down the corridor
to himself theres no place like home
theres no place like home
theres no place like home
turns onto the top of the stairwell down a few steps and is confronted by
asleep on the landing
woody freezes inches away from the sleeping beast
he slowly backs up the stairs
suddenly buzz appears and pulls woody back against the hallway wall
he covers woodys mouth with his hand
muffled gasp whisper another stunt like that cowboy youre going to get us killed
pulling buzzs hand away dont tell me what to do
buzz checks to make sure scud is still asleep and then darts across the stairwell opening to the other end of the hallway
once safely across he motions for woody to follow
woody cowardly crawls on all fours across the open area and meets up with buzz
as he stands
gets caught on one of the curls of the wrought iron railing
the toys begin to creep down the hallway unaware that woodys pullstring is being pulled farther and farther until it snaps off the iron railing and flies back towards woody
both buzz and woody leap in surprise at the sound of woodys voice box
woody vainly attempts to stifle the recoiling pullstring
continued giddy up partner
growling scud starts up the stairs
continued we got to get this wagon train a movin
woody and buzz take off running
two doors are ajar at the other end of the hallway
buzz dives behind one while woody jumps into
woody slams the door shut just as scud reaches the top of the landing
crashed can be heard from behind the closet door getting scuds attention
buzz peeks out from his doorway at scud sniffing and growling at the closet
sensing movement behind him scud whips around and starts to enter buzzs doorway
the noise stops the dog in his tracks
both scud and buzz look up to see
phillips is asleep on a la z boy recliner in front of the t
scud backs out and heads down the stairs
buzz turns to exit the room when he hears
calling buzz lightyear
come in buzz lightyear
this is star command
do you read me
buzz opens up his wrist communicator and is just about to speak into it when he is interrupted
buzz lightyear responding
read you loud and clear
buzz turns around to see
buzzs space ranger logo is on the screen over a field of stars
the image quickly changes to two young boys playing in their backyard with a buzz lightyear doll
buzz lightyear planet earth needs your help
into toy wrist communicator on the way
buzz reacts with confusion at what he is watching
he walks slowly towards the television set
the worlds greatest superhero
now the worlds greatest toy
the buzz lightyear doll is now out of the box and being displayed
buzz has it all
locking wrist communicator
calling buzz lightyear
karate chop action
with every feature demonstrated on the tv buzz compares the same feature on himself
multi phrase voice simulator
its a secret mission in uncharted space
buzz presses the same button on his uniform
its a secret mission in uncharted space
and best of all
big monster truck voice to infinity and beyond
on the tv screen the buzz lightyear action figure appears to be launched through the air
the words not a flying toy flash across the bottom of the screen
non excited lawyer voice not a flying toy
buzz slowly shakes his head in wide eyed disbelief
get your buzz lightyear action figure and save a galaxy near you
the image on the screen changes to a shot of hundreds of buzzes in their boxes lining either side of a store aisle
available at all als toy barn outlets in the tri county area
buzz is stricken
he looks down at his wrist communicator and opens it
molded on the underside of the cover are three words made buzz walks dejectedly out of the den and down the hallway
as he passes the top of the stairwell he pauses to look up through the railing at
it is open revealing the blue sky beyond
a bird flies past
the taunting voice of woody echoes in his head
you are a toy
you cant fly
buzz bows his head defeated
slowly buzz raises his head determination in his eyes
he slams the offending wrist communicator shut as if to deny its message of made in taiwan
buzz climbs up the railing to the banister
he pops open his wings and aims himself towards the window above
to infinity and beyond
buzz leaps off the banister
in slow motion buzz watches his square of blue sky pull farther away from him as he plummets to the floor below
buzz crashes on the entryway floor
buzz opens his eyes to see
the broken arm lies a few inches away from his now empty arm socket
buzz drops his head back in defeat
m o o om
mom have you seen my sally doll
hannah walks into the entryway and not seeing buzz steps on him
what was that
hannah picks up buzz and his arm and smiles
the knob jiggles for a moment
suddenly the door flies open revealing woody entangled in christmas lights standing atop a pile of boxes to be at doorknob height
woody and the rest of the junk topple over
a bowling ball topples out smashing woody square on the head
oo o of
to the hallway buzz
the coast is clear
where are you
its a secret mission in uncharted space
woody creeps down the hallway dragging the christmas lights with him
that is so o o interesting
woody peeks into the open doorway of
hannah is pretending to have a tea party
her guests are dolls headless dolls that is except for
he is seated at the miniature table dressed up in a frilly apron and fashionable party hat
continued would you like some tea mrs
under his breath buzz
hannah has placed a tiny teapot in buzzs severed arm and pours imaginary tea with it
its so nice you could join us on such late notice
woody steps back into the hallway
what a lovely hat mrs
it goes quite well with your head
woody thinks for a moment then takes a few steps further down the hall
he clears his throat
high voice hannah
hannah stops pouring tea and looks up
yelling out her room mom
to the dolls please excuse me ladies
ill be right back
as soon as hannah exits the room buzz keels over face down onto the table
hannah passes woody hidden in the christmas lights and walks downstairs
what is it mom
mom where are you
woody bolts into hannahs room
are you okay
buzz lifts his head up and wails in drunken despair
its all go o one
all of its gone
woody picks up buzzs severed arm
what happened to you
one minute youre defending the whole galaxy
pointing at other dolls and suddenly you find yourself suckin down darjeeling with marie antoinette and her little sisters
the headless dolls turn and wave
woody removes the teapot from the severed arm and sets it on the table
i think youve had enough tea for today
helping buzz up lets get you out of here buzz
grabbing woody dont you get it
you see the hat
i am mrs
hysterical laughter snap out of it buzz
woody presses buzzs helmet open slaps him across the face with his own detached arm and then politely closes the helmet
buzz sobers up and calmly takes his severed arm from woody
buzz walks out of the room while woody follows
sober im sorry
continued im just a little depressed thats all
i can get through this
buzz reaches the center of the hallway and drops to his knees
oh im a sham
loud whisper sh h h h h
look at me
i cant even fly out of a window
woody stops short
he looks down the hallway in the direction of sids room
woody can see straight out sids window across the way to andys bedroom window
continued but the hat looked good
tell me the hat looked good
the apron is a bit much its not my color
out the window
buzz youre a genius
woody grabs the coil of christmas lights and drags buzz towards sids room
continued come on this way
years of academy training
potato head and hamm are playing battleship
hamms wearing potato heads hat

oh quit your whining and pay up
potato head reaches for his ear
no no not the ear
gimme the nose
pulling out his nose nasally how bout three out of five
he is about to hand his nose over to hamm when
both toys look across the way
woody has just finished lifting sids window and waves to the toys
son of a building block its woody
hes in the psychos bedroom
into andys bedroom everyone its woody
slinky bo peep and rex look to the window

buzz is not there
woody looks down at the floor
buzz is sitting on the floor playing bombs away with his broken arm
the rest of andys toys gather around the window to see woody

woody tosses one end of the christmas lights over
slinky catches them

potato head grabs the string of lights away from slinky

no no no

buzz is fine
buzz is right here
hes with me
you are a liar
no im not
to buzz buzz come over here and you just tell the nice toys that youre not dead
he doesnt respond preoccupied with peeling off the sticker on his wrist communicator
he crumples it up and tosses it aside
to andys toys just a sec
frantic woody walks over to the edge of the desk
will you get up here and give me a hand
buzzs severed arm comes flying into view and lands by woodys feet
insincerely ha ha
thats very funny buzz
exploding this is serious
whered ya go
buzz aint there
woody reappears at the edge of sids window
he pretends to notice something out of the other toys view
forced casualness oh hi buzz
why dont you say hello to the guys over there
suddenly appears with woody holding the end just out of sight
woody throws his voice pretending to be buzz
hi ya fellas
to infinity and beyond
shaking the arms hand yeah hey buzz
lets show the guys our new secret best friends hand shake
gimme five man
somethings screwy here
so you see
were friends now guys

gimme a hug
woody makes buzzs arm grab his neck and pull him forward
continued as himself ha ha oh i love you too
it is buzz
now give back the lights potato head
wait just a minute
what are you trying to pull
woody innocently shrugs and throws both his hands up
exposing the severed arm
the toys all scream in horror
rex clasps his hands to his mouth and turns away to barf
realizing his mistake woody tries to hide the arm but its too late
oh that is disgusting
no no no no
you murdering dog
no its not what you think i swear
save it for the jury
i hope sid pulls your voice box out ya creep
potato head drops the lights
youve gotta help us please
you dont know what its like over here
to the other toys come on
lets get out of here
go back to your lives citizens
all the toys leave the window except slinky
listen to me
unable to look woody in the eye slinky closes the blinds
sli i i inkyyy
as storm clouds roll over sids house woody slumps over the window sill in defeat
broken toy sounds emit from behind woody
he turns from the window to see
converging all around buzz
still holding onto buzzs arm woody jumps down from the desk and runs to buzzs rescue
go away you disgusting freaks
babyface turns from the fray and charges at woody with his erector set pinchers
woody cowers shielding himself from buzzs arm
babyface clamps onto the arm and has a tug o war with woody
back you cannibals
woody loses his grip on the arm and sails across the room crashing into the wall
by now there is no sight of buzz within the swarming mass of mutant toys
woody attacks the mob with a vengeance
he is still alive and youre not gonna get him you monsters
he furiously throws the mutant toys aside digging his way to
he is sitting up his broken arm now newly attached
woodys anger turns to confusion
hey they fixed you
woody shakes buzzs arm to confirm what hes seeing is real when he looks to the mutants
continued but but theyre cannibals
we saw them eat those other toys
the mutant toys part to reveal the recent victims of sids last operation the janie doll and pterodactyl
their heads have been taped back on the correct bodies
the mutants all innocently stare at woody
i thought that you were gonna
laughs nervously you know eat my friend
immediately the mutant toys retreat back into the dark corners of the room
no no wait
not now mom im busy
footsteps approach the bedroom
woody tries to pick up the still depressed buzz but he just goes limp
cmon get up
woody begins dragging buzz towards the bed but their progress is too slow
he shakes buzz hard
let sid trash you
but dont blame me
woody leaves buzz sitting alone in the middle of the floor and hides underneath a nearby milkcrate just as
sid enters carrying a big box
it finally came
sid runs over to his workbench and rips open the box
reverently the big one
he pulls out a rocket with the big one written on it
reading the rocket label extremely dangerous
keep out of reach of children
looks around what am i gonna blow
hey wheres that wimpy cowboy doll
sid spots the milkcrate and picks it up
out of sids view woody presses against the inside hanging on for dear life
sid looks down and notices hes stepping on buzz activating his laser
ive always wanted to put a spaceman into orbit
he places buzz and the milkcrate on the workbench and throws a toolbox on top of the crate
the impact of the toolbox dislodges woody from his hiding place
woody quickly ducks under a magazine on the floor of the crate jail
woody watches helplessly as sid fishes out a roll of electrical tape from the toolbox and with an irreverent chuckle tapes buzz to the rocket
a flash of lightning interrupts the moment
sid crosses to the window to see a huge rainstorm commence
sullenly he smacks his head against the window
woody heaves a sigh of relief
suddenly sids face brightens
he turns his focus from the rain to the buzzrocket
as newscaster sid phillips reporting
launch of the shuttle has been delayed due to adverse weather conditions at the launch site
sid smacks buzz down on the desk winds his alarm clock and places it next to buzz
ha ha ha
andy is being tucked into bed by his mother
she hands him his cowboy hat
i looked everywhere honey but all i could find was your hat
groggy but what if we leave them behind
oh dont worry honey im sure well find woody and buzz before we leave tomorrow
andys eyes shut
mom turns out the light and quietly exits the room
a moving box on the floor with the words andys toys
scrawled on it begins to shake from side to side
i need air
rex pops out of the top of the box coughing a packing styrofoam peanut out of his mouth
potato head appears beside him
relieved aa a a a ah
will you quit moving around
its just that i get so nervous before i travel
how did i get stuck with you as a moving buddy
potato head drops back down into the box
following potato head everyone else was picked
peeks around the corner of one of the boxes and looks up at andy fast asleep clutching his cowboy hat
oh woody if only you could see how much andy misses you
thunder rumbles as rain pours down outside the spooky dwelling
sid is in bed fast asleep
woody struggles to move his milkcrate jail but with the weight of the toolbox on top it wont budge
woody looks across the desktop at buzz sitting dejectedly with the rocket strapped to his back
ps s s s t
no reaction from buzz
woody picks up a stray washer from the desktop and flings it at buzz striking his helmet
buzz lifts his head and turns lifelessly to look at woody
get over here and see if you can get this tool box off me
buzz just looks away from woody and bows his head
oh come on buzz
buzz i cant do this without you
i need your help
i cant help
i cant help anyone
why sure you can buzz
you can get me out of here and then ill get that rocket off you and well make a break for andys house
whats the difference
oh buzz youve had a big fall
you must not be thinking clearly
no woody for the first time i am thinking clearly
looking at himself you were right all along
im not a space ranger
im just a toy
a stupid little insignificant toy
whoa hey wait a minute
being a toy is a lot better than being a space ranger
no it is
look over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest and its not because youre a space ranger pal its because youre a toy
you are his toy
but why would andy want me
why would andy want you
look at you
youre a buzz lightyear
any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you
youve got wings you glow in the dark you talk your helmet does that that whoosh thing you are a cool toy
woody pauses and looks at himself
continued depressed as a matter of fact youre too cool
i mean i mean what chance does a toy like me have against a buzz lightyear action figure
all i can do is
woody pulls his own pull string
theres a snake in my boots
woody bows his head
why would andy ever want to play with me when hes got you
pause im the one that should be strapped to that rocket
woody slumps dejectedly against the crate his back to buzz
buzz lifts up his foot
the signature andy reads through the dirt and scuff marks
buzz gazes back at woody
a look of determination spreads across his face
listen buzz forget about me
you should get out of here while you can
woody turns around
buzz is gone
suddenly the entire milkcrate begins to shake
woody looks up to see
he is on top of the milkcrate trying to push the tool box off
what are you doing
i thought you were come on sheriff
theres a kid over in that house who needs us
now lets get you out of this thing
both buzz and woody push the milkcrate and together they finally get it to move but its slow progress
strained come on buzz
we can do it
the two toys stop to look out the window by the workbench
with the rain stopped and the sun beginning to rise
can be seen pulling up in front of andys house
its the moving van
weve got to get out of here
buzz braces himself between the tool chest and the wall
using his legs buzz pushes with all his might
the toolbox begins to move
woody notices that with every shove buzz gives to the tool chest the milkcrate begins to edge out over the lip of the desk
finally the gap is wide enough for woody to jump through
woody drops down to the floor below
loud whisper alright
buzz doesnt hear woody and continues to shove the toolbox and milkcrate farther out
almost there woody looks up just in time to see the entire toolbox and milkcrate topple towards him
nervous laugh the toolbox crashes right on top of woody
buzz falls onto the desktop and glances over to sid who stirs
in his sleep i wanna ride the pony
sid does not wake
buzz heaves a sigh of relief then peers over the edge of the workbench
are you alright
woody lifts himself out from under the rubble
punch drunk no im fine
it goes off by sids bed
woody drops back under the toolbox and buzz goes limp
sid groggily sits up for a beat then his eyes light up
time for lift off
sid jumps out of bed grabs buzz and bolts out of the room
woody leaps to his feet runs across the room and catches the door just before it closes
as he swings the door back open woody is confronted by
the dog barrels down the hallway straight for woody
woody slams the door shut just in time
scud barks and scratches at the door
out of breath to himself okay what do i do
come on woody think
woody looks across the room
have appeared all around the room
the mutant toys all scatter and hide
no no no
theres a good toy down there and hes hes going to be blown to bits in a few minutes all because of me
ive gotta save him
pause but i need your help
woody then notices babyface timidly peeking out of the shadows from under the bed
hes my friend
hes the only one ive got
babyface crawls out and bangs in code on the side of sids metal bedpost
the mutant toys emerge from the shadows and gather around woody
he kneels down into a huddle with them
to babyface thank you
to the others okay
i think i know what to do
were going to have to break a few rules but if it works itll help everybody
the movers cart out the last load
a forlorn andy clutches onto buzzs spaceship box in one hand and his cowboy hat in the other
andy scans the empty room and heaves a sad sigh
sid comes out of the she carrying a bunch of materials under his arm
as astronaut houston to mission control
come in control
he drops the junk down beside an inanimate buzz
continued launch pad is being constructed
scud is planted right outside sids bedroom door poised to attack anything that exits
woody has created a little diagram of the house and yard out of dominoes and scrabble tiles
he points to it with a pencil as he addresses the mutants
all right listen up
i need pump boy here ducky here
legs the toy fishing rod with fashion doll legs steps forward from the crowd
continued to legs youre with ducky
to the others rollerbob and i dont move till we get the signal
the mutants all give an affirmative nod
okay lets move
the toys all break
legs and ducky a duck head pez dispenser with baby doll torso and plunger base rush over to a heating grate and pull the face plate off the wall
they disappear into the heating duct
ducky and legs come to an intersection
ducky quacks and they head down the right tunnel
hand in the box the rubber hand in the jack in the box stacks on top of several mutant toys to reach the doorknob of the bedroom door
woody hops onto rollerbob a skateboard with a soldiers upper torso tied to its front
wind the frog
walking car a hot wheels car with baby arms begins winding up the frog a tin wind up frog with monster truck wheels instead of legs
a bottom of wall insulation is pushed aside to reveal ducky and legs
they make their way towards a junction box sitting in the center of the floor
ducky and legs lift the loose junction box
suddenly lifts upward and disappears into the roof
ducky extends his pez neck out of the hole to check that the coast is clear
all the toys have manned their positions and wait silently their eyes fixed on woody
wait for the signal
ducky takes the end of the line off legs fishing reel hooks it onto himself and is then lowered down through the open hole
hanging halfway down the front door ducky begins to swing
eventually he swings far enough to reach his destination the doorbell
ducky presses it
woody throws his arm down
hand in the box throws open the door and the frog is let loose
the frog zips through scuds legs and down the hallway
scud chases after it and follows it down the stairs
ill get it
woody helps the rest of the mutant toys onto the skateboard
alright lets go
using his front arms rollerbob propels the skateboard and crew out into the hallway
hannah walks to the front door
and opens it
hannah doesnt notice ducky stuck to the porch floor by his plunger
zooms down the stairs with scud barking right behind
the frog leaps off the last step speeds through hannahs legs and out the open front door
hannah looks back inside at scud
in that moment ducky catches the frog and is quickly reeled upwards back into the roof
scud bursts through hannahs legs knocking her over and runs out onto the empty porch
annoyed scud suddenly realizes hes been duped but before he can get back inside hannah slams the front door shut
scud smashes into the closed door and begins barking furiously
as hannah storms off into another room she doesnt notice woody and the mutants zipping off the stairs and round the corner heading straight into the kitchen
by now rollerbob has really picked up speed
he shoots underneath the kitchen table through the maze of chair legs straight towards
the mutants all push back causing the rollerbob to do a wheelie
they smash through the doggie door
and catapult into the bushes
the toys peek out from the bush to see buzz strapped to the launchpad
sid is still in the toolshed
uh mission control
is the launchpad construction complete
simulated static uh roger rocket is now secured to guide wire
we are currently obtaining the
countdown will commence momentarily
stand by simulated static ducky legs and the frog shoot out into the yard from a drain pipe
they exchange a thumbs up with woody
to toys in the bush lets go
the mutants disperse to their designated places in the yard
where are the matches
oh oh wait here they are
woody runs towards buzz who spots woody approaching
loud whisper woody
help me out of this thing
woody stops a few feet away from buzz
loud whisper its ok
everythings under control
woody deliberately falls down limp on the grass
what are you doing
sid emerges from the tool shed
houston all systems are go
requesting permission to launch spotting woody hey
howd you get out here
sid picks up woody examines him for a beat and then smiles
oh well you and i can have a cookout later
ha ha ha
he sticks a match prominently in woodys holster and tosses him onto the grill of an open barbecue
houston do we have permission to launch
simulated static uh roger permission granted
you are confirmed at t minus seconds
during sids countdown all the mutants scurry into their final positions
sid lights a match
continued and counting
sid grins menacingly as the match moves towards the fuse
reach for the sky
sid pulls back from lighting the fuse
he turns to look at woody still lying lifelessly atop the barbecue except for the sound emitting from his voice box
this town aint big enough for the two of us
sid walks over to woody and picks him up
somebodys poisoned the water hole
he raises woody up about to throw him away who are you callin busted buster
sid stops short and looks at woody again
continued thats right
im talking to you sid phillips
we dont like being blown up sid or smashed or ripped apart
while woodys voice box talks sid checks the pullstring
it isnt moving
w w w we
beat your toys
the remains of broken toys in the yard led by the bedroom mutants begin rising from the ground in night of the living dead fashion
the toys march forward forming a circle around sid
sid is too frightened to scream or move
from now on you must take good care of your toys
because if you dont well find out sid
we toys can see
woodys inanimate head rotates degrees
for a split second woodys face comes to life
regular voice so play nice
sid drops woody and bolts inside the house
woody and all the toys cheer victoriously
hannah has just come downstairs carrying a new doll when sid rushes up to her
the toys are alive
sid eyes hannahs doll and pats it gently on the head
continued n n nice dolly
hannah sensing sids fear suddenly thrusts the doll in sids face
he screams and runs upstairs
hannah chases after him taunting
whats wrong sid
dont you want to play with sally
the toys are all congratulating one another
nice work fellahs
comin out of the ground what a touch
that was a stroke of genius
woody turns around and looks at buzz whos still affixed to sids launchpad
buzz extends his hand to woody
everybody say bye house
depressed bye house
buzz and woody look in the direction of andys house
through the fence andy and his family can be seen getting into the van
woody quickly hoists buzz off the pole he was tied to
to mutant toys we gotta run
with the rocket still taped to buzz the two toys sprint towards the fence
woody easily slips through the slats in the fence but buzzs rocket causes him to become stuck
woody has climbed up on to the rear bumper of the van before realizing that buzz is missing
he looks back to discover buzz stuck in the fence
ill catch up
woody jumps down and runs back for buzz
the van begins pulling out of the driveway
woody tugs on a loosened slat and breaks buzz free of the fence
the two toys run out into the street just in time to see the van driving off down the street
woody and buzz turn around
drives right over them
woody and buzz scream ducking just in time
after the truck passes buzz runs after it with woody a few steps behind
scud is lying on the porch when he suddenly perks up at the sight of the two tiny toys running down the street after the moving truck
scud bears his teeth and growls
buzz runs up close to the truck with woody still back a few paces
dangles off the back of the truck
buzz makes a leap for it and grabs hold
he climbs up the strap and onto the bumper
woody then lunges for the strap but it stays just out of reach
you can do it woody
woody gives a mighty leap and catches hold of the strap
whew i made it
woody begins climbing up when suddenly buzz goes pale
woody looks behind him to see
the dog leaps forward and bites down on one of woodys legs
kicking scud with other foot aaaaaahh
get away you stupid dog
scud tugs on woody pulling him down to the end of the strap
hold on woody
i cant do it
take care of andy for me
buzz leaps off of the truck and onto scuds snout
he grabs scuds eyelids and snaps them hard
scud yelps letting go of woody
the dog bucks wildly with buzz hanging onto his face
the moving truck continues down the street leaving buzz and scud behind
still hanging onto the strap woody scrambles up onto the bumper
he unlocks the back door of the truck and tries to lift up the heavy door
suddenly the family van and moving truck come to a stop at a traffic light
woody slams into the door causing it to fly upward taking woody with it
hanging from the door woody scans the inside of the truck until he spots what hes looking for
with the words andys toys written on them in crayon
scud flings buzz off his face
buzz goes tumbling under a parked car
scud runs over to the car but is too big to get under it
woody rips into one of andys boxes
all the toys wince and moan as they cover their eyes from the sudden brightness
are we there already
howd you woodys response is to slide the box aside and begin rummaging through the next box
slinky potato head rex and the other toys grumble in confusion as they poke their heads up out of the first box
there you are
woody pulls the rc car and its remote out of the second box
whats he doing
woody runs to the back of the truck and throws the rc car out onto the street
the other toys scream in horror
hes at it again
woody turns on the remote and steers the rc car past scud and under the parked car where buzz is hiding
rcs motor whirrs happily at the sight of buzz
the traffic light turns green allowing the van and truck to cross the intersection
pointing at woody get him
all the toys pour out of their boxes and charge on woody
woody continues to steer the remote while trying to avoid the angry mob of toys
buzz jumps on to the rc car and they zoom back towards the moving truck
scud is right on their heels and is about to chomp down on buzz rocky picks up woody and spins him over his head
no no no
as rocky spins him whoa whoa whoa
the rc car suddenly swerves from scuds jaws and starts doing doughnuts matching woodys in the middle of the street
spinning whoa whoa whoa
rocky throws woody to the floor
rc resumes his course straight down the street with scud giving close chase
hamm leaps off a pile of boxes and onto woody
the rc car hops up in the air tossing buzz up and off
buzz manages to land back on rc but facing backwards
it changes red again and the wall of cross traffic resumes
buzz and the rc car drive straight into it
scud blindly follows them into the traffic and skids to a halt just missing a car
the car swerves and crashes into another car
soon there is a multi car pile up that encircles scud entrapping the dog
buzz and the rc car emerge from the intersection safely on the other side
the mob of toys lift up woody still holding the remote and head for the open back
you dont understand
buzz is out there
weve gotta help him
toss im overboard
no no no wait
the toys toss him out into the road
as the truck drives off the toys cheer
so long woody
woody turns around and ducks just in time as a car passes over him
shaken woody tries to get up again when
come barreling towards him
who o o oa
the rc car sweeps up woody and keeps driving
woody finds himself sitting in front of buzz still holding the remote
well thanks for the ride
pointing ahead look out
the toys are about to slam into the rear tire of the car that had passed over woody earlier
woody screams and gives the steering wheel on the remote a hard left missing the tire by inches
the rc car moves up under the car
now lets catch up to that truck
woody flicks a switch from on to turbo
the rc car speeds up towards the moving truck
the toys are busy congratulating one another when lenny the wind up binoculars glances out the back and spots buzz and woody
woodys riding rc
and buzz is with him
the toys rush to the edge of the open truck
bo picks up lenny and looks through him
it is buzz
woody was telling the truth
what have we done
now i have guilt
the rc car begins to gain on the truck
were almost there
rocky the wrestler doll rushes over to a lever on the side of the back
the sign above it reads ramp up down
rocky pushes down hard on the lever
the ramp begins to lower
woody buzz look up to see the ramp about to come down right on top of them
the rc car pulls back just before the heavy ramp slams into the road
sparks fly everywhere from the metal scraping the pavement
to other toys quick
hold on to my tail
potato head and rex grabs on to slinkys tail allowing slinkys front end to jump off the truck and onto the ramp
slinky leans forward with his paw outstretched to woody
woody hands the remote to buzz and leans forward to grab slinkys hand
they grab hold of one another
that a boy slink
all of a sudden the rc car begins to slow down pulling slinkys front end off the ramp
his slinky middle begins to stretch and stretch
to buzz speed up
theyre running out
rcs headlight eyes sag
the car slows even more
as slinky continues stretching
the rc car begins to weave side to side like a water skier
with mom and andy preoccupied baby molly looks in her sideview mirror
the rc car w woody and buzz weaves into view and then back out
molly squeals with delight
with slinkys mid section stretched to the limit he begins to lose his grip on woody
i cant hold on much longer
slinkys hand slips sending his front shooting back into the moving truck and knocking over all the toys
the rc car sputters to a stop
woody and buzz watch in vain as the family van and moving truck disappear
buzz tosses the remote to the ground in frustration
woody pulls out the match from his holster that sid had put there earlier
thank you sid
woody runs around behind buzz strikes the match against rcs back tire and is about to light the fuse when
whizzes right over them blowing out the match
woody clenches the burnt match in his hands and falls prostrate to the ground
no o o
no no no no
no o o
unable to watch a cowboy cry buzz bows his head causing his helmet to block the sun from woody
as buzzs shadow passes over him woody stops whimpering and looks at his hand
like the one generated from sids magnifying glass appears on the back of woodys hand
woody leaps up grabs buzzs helmet and aligns it so the white dot hits the tip of the fuse
what are you doing
hold still buzz
the fuse lights
you did it
woody jumps back onto the car then suddenly stops smiling
wait a minute
i just lit a rocket
rockets explo the rc car rockets forward
speeding along the dividing line in the road it easily passes car after car until the moving truck can be seen on the horizon
the toys are gathered around slinky his spring splayed out on the floor
i shoulda held on longer
lenny looks out the back again
its woody and buzz
comin up fast
the toys run to the opening and cheer
the rocket is so strong that it begins to lift buzz and woody off the rc car
woody manages to continue holding onto rc but not for long
the toys cheering turns to screaming as they rush to get out of the way of the oncoming rc rocket
woody is forced to let go of the rc car
they separate sending the two toys upward and rc into the back of the truck
rc smashes into potato head sending all of his parts flying
the rocket hurtles upward higher and higher
this is the part where we blow up
buzz confidently presses the button on his chest
jut out of buzz severing the tape that holds him to rocket
the toys separate from the rocket just before it blows up
the toys plummet
covering his eyes ah h h h h
just then buzz banks under some power lines and soars upward again
woody takes a peek
this isnt flying
this is falling with style
to infinity and beyond
they soar gracefully towards the moving truck but then pass over it
we missed the truck
were not aiming for the truck
buzz and woody fly right over the vans sun roof and then drop into the car
before anyone can notice woody and buzz land in an open box in the back seat right next to andy
andy turns to discover the limp buzz and woody lying in the box
what is it
picking up the toys woody
oh great you found them
where were they
in the car
now what did i tell you
right where you left them
andy hugs both toys
they give each other a knowing wink
through the gently falling snow the davis family can be seen around the christmas tree unwrapping presents
which one can i open first
lets let molly open one
one of the christmas bulbs moves aside to reveal
the plastic green soldier spies on the davis family with his binoculars
he turns and motions back into the tree
a baby monitor sits wedged between some branches supported by several green army men
one of the soldiers turns it on
the receiving end of the monitor is atop andys night stand
it crackles with static
over the monitor frankincense this is myrrh
come in frankincense
buzz sits on the edge of andys bed while hamm rests on the nightstand alongside the monitor
they listen intently
to the room hey heads up everybody
woody and the rest of the toys are mingling together like a typical office christmas party
the toys all stop and run towards the monitor
woody is about to follow when a crook pulls him backwards to reveal
rubbing his neck theres gotta be a less painful way to get my attention
merry christmas sheriff
she smiles and points her crook upwards to her sheep perched on a shelf dangling mistletoe
say isnt that mistletoe
bo drops her crook dips woody and kisses him
the rest of the toys have congregated below the monitor restless with excitement not fear
to slinky maybe andyll get another dinosaur like a leaf eater
that way i could play the uh dominant predator
ha ha ha
slinky laughs with rex
quiet everyone quiet
over monitor mollys first present i i is
way to go idaho
all the toys congratulate potato head
gee i better shave
potato head whips off his moustache piece
woody climbs up onto the bed and joins buzz
lipstick now covers woodys face
over monitor come in frankincense
andy is now opening his first present buzz bangs on the side of the monitor
you are not worried are you
over monitor i cant quite make out defensively me
no no no no
beat are you
laughing now buzz what could andy possibly get that is worse than you
we truck out through the window to the ext
as we hear
oh what is it
what is it
we zoom back through the window to a close up of buzz and woody
